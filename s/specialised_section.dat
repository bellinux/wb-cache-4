The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model was applied as theoretical framework to identify the unique job resources and job demands driving work engagement and turnover intentions of employees within this highly <b>specialised</b> <b>section</b> of the South African banking industry. Quantitative data was collected from 239 IT professionals via a self-administered, web-based survey comprising of four sections. Participation in the survey was voluntary, anonymous and confidential. The first section of the survey consisted of gathering of the participants’ biographical and employment information. The subsequent sections provided a measurement of the specific latent variables using valid and reliable measuring instruments, including the the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES- 17) designed by Schaufeli, Salanova, González-Romá and Bakker (2002), the Job Demands- Resources Scale (Jackson & Rothmann, 2005), and Roodt’s (2004) Turnover Intentions Scale (TIS) ...|$|E

50|$|The Bristol Naturalists' Society was {{established}} on 8 May 1862. The {{purpose of the}} organisation is to promote natural science through a schedule of regular meetings during which scientific subjects are addressed and associated items may be exhibited. Other goals have included the amassing of a library of books connected to natural science, {{as well as the}} publication of the Proceedings of the society. Monthly meetings of the general membership are held from October to May at University College, Bristol, the predecessor to the University of Bristol. The society has maintained close ties to the University of Bristol and the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery throughout its history. During the society's general meetings, lectures are given, usually by club members. At least one excursion is undertaken each summer. In addition to general membership, club members can opt to join {{one or more of the}} <b>specialised</b> <b>sections</b> of the association: Botanical, Entomological, and Geological. The sections hold meetings as well. Sections in Chemistry and Ornithology were added later in the nineteenth century. The Library of the Bristol Naturalists' Society was initially in its rooms at the Literary and Philosophic Club at 20 Berkeley Square, now the University and Literary Club (Unilit). In addition to books and periodicals, the library contains other valuable works. The Proceedings of the Bristol Naturalists' Society are published annually.|$|R

40|$|Mediterranean and West European pre-modern {{agriculture}} (agriculture before 1600) was {{by necessity}} ‘organic agriculture’. Crop protection is {{part and parcel}} of this agriculture, with weed control in the forefront. Crop protection is embedded in the medieval agronomy text books but <b>specialised</b> <b>sections</b> do occur. Weeds, insects and diseases are described but identification in modern terms is not easy. The pre-modern ‘Crop Portfolio’ is well filled, certainly in the Mediterranean area. The medieval ‘Pest Portfolio’ differs from the modern one because agriculture then was a Low External Input Agriculture, and because the proportion of cultivated to non-cultivated land was drastically lower than today. The pre-modern ‘Control Portfolio’ is surprisingly rich, both in preventive and interventive measures. Prevention was by risk management, intensive tillage, and careful storage. Intervention was mechanical and chemical. Chemical intervention used natural substances such as sulphur, pitch, and ‘botanicals’. Some fifty plant species are mentioned in a crop protection context. Though application methods look rather modern they are typically low-tech. Among them are seed disinfection, spraying, dusting, fumigation, grease banding, wound care, and hand-picking but also scarification, now outdated. The reality of pest outbreaks and other damages is explored as to frequency, intensity, and extent. Information on the practical use of the recommended treatments is scanty. If applied, their effectiveness remains enigmatic. Three medieval agronomists are at the heart of this book, but historical developments in crop protection from early Punic, Greek, and Roman authors to the first modern author are outlined. The readership of these writers was the privileged class of landowners but hints pointing to the exchange of ideas between them and the common peasant were found. Consideration is given to the pre-modern reasoning in matters of crop protection. Comparison of pre-modern crop protection and its counterpart in modern organic agriculture is difficult because of drastic changes in the relation between crop areas and non-crop areas, and because of the great difference in yield levels then and now, with several associated differences...|$|R
40|$|The Danish {{unemployment}} insurance funds {{are at the}} moment {{in a period of}} time characterized by change. During {{the last couple of years}} there has been a series of remarkable amendments to the laws on the area that has changed the conditions under which the {{unemployment insurance}} funds function. Furthermore, the competition for members has increased, and many of the unemployment funds are experiencing a decrease in their membership. This has brought along a discussion of the relevance of the funds in their current form. The present Minister of employment has declared that the unemployment insurance funds should consider themselves as being examined in their handling of new responsibilities that the ‘welfare reform’ from 2007 has assigned to them. The circumstances position the unemployment insurance funds under pressure. They have to be both economically efficient, have a controlling and authoritative function towards the unemployed members, and at the same time attend to the interest of the members. This thesis takes its starting point in HK’s unemployment insurance fund that implemented major organisational changes in October 2007 centralising the unemployment insurance fund and dividing the employees into <b>specialised</b> <b>sections,</b> each with a specific part of the fund’s functions. The focus is on how HK’s unemployment insurance fund, through the organisational changes, has adapted to the conditions on the area, and how this affects the relation to the members. The thesis analyses this focus through a case study based on qualitative interviews in a local section of the unemployment insurance fund, supplemented with a survey sent to the majority of the employees in HK’s unemployment insurance fund. The theoretical foundation of the analysis is theory on institutional change, isomorphism, by DiMaggio and Powell and organisation theory by Mintzberg concerning organisational structures and configurations. The analysis has shown that the organisational changes in HK’s unemployment insurance fund have meant a significant change in the employees work, and the relation to the members. We found resistance towards the changes and a negative attitude among the employees. However, at the same time they also expressed advantages in the new way of dividing the functions and understanding relating to the need for change. The relation to the members has changed both due to the political and organisational changes. The employees feel the stress and difficulties due to the pressure on the unemployment insurance fund to be both controlling, a service organisation and economically sustainable. This affects the contact with the members, both because the form of communication has changed away from personal meetings towards electronic communication, and because they are the ones directly facing the challenges of being both controlling and service minded towards the members...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{the thesis}} is to present an {{analysis}} {{of a group of}} entities legally referred to as "the Police authorities" at preparatory criminal proceedings and to define the material and local competency of such authorities, also {{in the context of the}} contemplated or, as the case may be, already implemented regulation thereof.

40|$|Fragmentation of bio-medicolegal {{knowledge}} {{has led to}} a proliferation of ultra-specialised sub-disciplines and branches, often published in 'field-oriented' scientific journals. The aim of this work is to provide an in-depth analytical picture of bio-medicolegal sources of publication, within and outside the traditional conception of legal medicine. An extensive search of bio-medicolegal articles published in the last {{five and a half years}} was performed on the MEDLINE database according to MeSH terms combined with free-text protocols. We performed a systematic analysis of targeted journals after merging, selecting and categorising all retrieved records, taking into account data from the 2009 JCR Science Edition (released on June 2010); 1, 037 different journals were identified, of which only 48 (4. 6 %) focus specifically on bio-medicolegal matters, and of which only seven (14. 6 %) have an impact factor (IF). Despite this apparent dispersion, 47 % of articles were published in bio-medicolegal journals (BML), of which 70. 2 % were in journals with IF (BML-IF). Articles published in BML-IF journals (33 % of total papers) reach almost 50 %, mainly in "Forensic Science International", "International Journal of Legal Medicine" and "Journal of Forensic Sciences". Instead, publications in not specifically bio-medicolegal journals (Not BML-IF) are greatly scattered and even fragmented in about 650 journals. The sub-disciplines that appear most frequently in Not BML-IF rather than BML-IF journals are Forensic Psychiatry (48. 2 % vs. 5. 1 %), Criminology (37. 1 % vs. 8. 3 %), Malpractice (50. 7 % vs. 4. 0 %), Medical Law and Ethics (46. 4 % vs. 6. 9 %) and Clinical Forensic Medicine (39. 5 % vs. 21. 3 %). The proposed bibliometric analysis revealed the preference of Forensic Pathology, Criminalistics (Biological), Forensic Genetics, Forensic Anthropology and Forensic Entomology for journals traditionally considered pertinent to the medico-legal discipline, with a considerable dispersion involving Toxicology, Psychiatry, Criminology and Malpractice, which were published in less well-known journals. This dispersion could be reduced adapting <b>specialised</b> forensic <b>sections</b> and increasing the IF of forensic journals, in order to respond suitably to the present demand for visibility by bio-medicolegal scientists, clearly oriented towards enhancing the objective impact of their curricula and attempting to attract funding to their research projects...|$|R
40|$|The Hospital Information System, first {{developed}} at our main institute for {{the integration of}} clinical, administrative and management resources in Cardiology, has been recently extended for use at our <b>section</b> <b>specialised</b> in Cardiac Surgery. Extension of the electronic medical record (EMR) to the management of patients admitted in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery started {{with the development of}} a system for reporting operations in structured form and for estimating their complexity, according to a model set up in a previous study involving our institute and other two pediatric cardiac surgery centers. The international congenital heart surgery nomenclature, promoted in Europe by the Pediatric European Cardiac Surgical Registry (ECSUR) project, was adopted. The ECSUR data set with associated short lists (translated into Italian) of pre-operative risk factors, diagnoses, procedures and complications was implemented in our EMR. Minor coding expansions were suggested by both surgeons and cardiologists. EMR interface was developed to record, for each operation, diagnoses and procedures, patient findings and conditions, operative events and methods. Information on patient history and on follow-up was also recorded. From the combination of underlying diagnosis and procedure each operation was classified in terms of 3 -level complexity according to the developed multicenter model. The system is used daily for reporting operations in our Pediatric Cardiac Surgery department. All operations since January 2000 were archived (a total of 547 in two years) and data were periodically exported and submitted to the ECSUR database center. A comprehensive data bank is being developed allowing both clinical management and research as well as risk stratification and outcome analysis. Moreover estimation of operation complexity is useful to evaluate DRG 2 ̆ 7 s, often underestimated in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery...|$|R
40|$|Air {{transportation}} of Australian casualties in World War II was initially {{carried out in}} air ambulances with an accompanying male medical orderly. By late 1943 with the war effort concentrated in the Pacific, Allied military authorities realised that air transport was needed to move the increasing numbers of casualties over longer distances. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) became responsible for air evacuation of Australian casualties and established a formal medical air evacuation system with trained flight teams early in 1944. Specialised Medical Air Evacuation Transport Units (MAETUs) were established whose sole responsibility was undertaking air evacuations of Australian casualties from the forward operational areas back to definitive medical care. Flight teams consisting of a RAAF nursing sister (registered nurse) and a medical orderly carried out the escort duties. These personnel had been specially trained in Australia for their role. Post-WWII, the RAAF Nursing Service was demobilised with {{a limited number of}} nurses being retained for the Interim Air Force. Subsequently, those nurses were offered commissions in the Permanent Air Force. Some of the nurses who remained were air evacuation trained and carried out air evacuations both in Australia and as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, Australia became responsible for the air evacuation of British Commonwealth casualties from Korea to Japan. With a re-organisation of the Australian forces as part of the British Commonwealth forces, RAAF nurses were posted to undertake air evacuation from Korea and back to Australia from Iwakuni, Japan. By 1952, a <b>specialised</b> casualty staging <b>section</b> was established in Seoul and staffed by RAAF nurses from Iwakuni on a rotation basis. The development of the Australian air evacuation system {{and the role of the}} flight nurses are not well documented for the period 1943 - 1953. The aims of this research are three fold and include documenting the origins and development of the air evacuation system from 1943 - 1953; analysing and documenting the RAAF nurse’s role and exploring whether any influences or lessons remain valid today. A traditional historical methodology of narrative and then analysis was used to inform the flight nurse’s role within the totality of the social system. Evidence was based on primary data sources mainly held in Defence files, the Australian War Memorial or the National Archives of Australia. Interviews with 12 ex-RAAF nurses from both WWII and the Korean War were conducted to provide information where there were gaps in the primary data and to enable exploration of the flight nurses’ role and their contributions in war of the air evacuation of casualties. Finally, this thesis highlights two lessons that remain valid today. The first is that interoperability of air evacuation systems with other nations is a force multiplier when resources are scarce or limited. Second, the pre-flight assessment of patients was essential and ensured that there were no deaths in-flight...|$|R
