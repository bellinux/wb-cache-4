25|$|The shunt {{connection}} results in smoother transfer characteristics and lower signal distortions, {{but also in}} a lower modulation range (−60dB). This limitation is lifted by connecting two shunt dividers in series, which keeps the transfer characteristic smooth. The best combination of a smooth transfer characteristic, low distortion, wide range of adjustment, and nearly equal rates of increase and decrease of the transmission coefficient is achieved in a series-parallel circuit composed of two ROs and a series resistor. The frequency response of such circuit {{is similar to that}} of the <b>series</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because of the <b>series</b> <b>connection</b> {{and removal}} of wordline contacts, a large grid of NANDflash memory cells will occupy perhaps only 60% {{of the area}} of {{equivalent}} NOR cells (assuming the same CMOS process resolution, for example, 130nm, 90nm, or 65nm). NANDflash's designers realized that the area of a NAND chip, and thus the cost, could be further reduced by removing the external address and data bus circuitry. Instead, external devices could communicate with NANDflash via sequential-accessed command and data registers, which would internally retrieve and output the necessary data. This design choice made random-access of NANDflash memory impossible, but the goal of NANDflash was to replace mechanical hard disks, not to replace ROMs.|$|E

2500|$|By design, a non-solid {{aluminum}} {{electrolytic capacitor}} has a second aluminum foil, the so-called cathode foil, for contacting the electrolyte.

2500|$|The {{rated voltage}} of {{different}} film materials depends on {{factors such as}} the thickness of the film, the quality of the material (freedom from physical defects and chemical impurities), the ambient temperature, and frequency of operation, plus a safety margin against the breakdown voltage (dielectric strength). But to a first approximation, the voltage rating of a film capacitor depends primarily on the thickness of the plastic film. For example, with the minimum available film thickness of polyester film capacitors (about 0.7µm), it is possible to produce capacitors with a rated voltage of 400VDC. If higher voltages are needed, typically a thicker plastic film will be used. [...] But the breakdown voltage for dielectric films is usually nonlinear. For thicknesses greater than about 5 mils, the breakdown voltage only increases approximately with the square-root of the film thickness. On the other hand, the capacitance decreases linearly with increased film thickness. [...] For reasons of availability, storage and existing processing capabilities, it is desirable to achieve higher breakdown voltages while using existing available film materials. This can be achieved by a one-sided partial metallization of the insulating films in such a manner that an internal <b>series</b> <b>connection</b> of capacitors is produced. By using this <b>series</b> <b>connection</b> technique, the total breakdown voltage of the capacitor can be multiplied by an arbitrary factor, but the total capacitance is also reduced by the same factor.|$|E

In {{the case of a}} shunt connection, the input impedance is reduced by this factor; {{and in the case of}} <b>series</b> <b>connection,</b> the impedance is multiplied by this factor. However, the impedance that is modified by feedback is the impedance of the amplifier in Figure 5 with the feedback turned off, and does include the modifications to impedance caused by the resistors of the feedback network.|$|E
