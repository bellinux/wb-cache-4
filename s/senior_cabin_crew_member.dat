50|$|As of Tuesday 1 December 2009, {{remains of}} nine <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> had been {{retrieved}} and arrived in Sana'a. The <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> found were Captain Khalid Hajeb, First Officer Ali Atif, the three Yemeni <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members,</b> the two Moroccan <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members,</b> and the Ethiopian <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member.</b> One <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member,</b> Hamdi Wazea, {{was buried in}} Sana'a, while the other Yemenis who were found were buried in Aden. The bodies of the Moroccans were sent to Morocco, while the Ethiopian was sent to Addis Ababa.

40|$|The 1 -year {{prevalence}} of regular or continuous neck pain in military helicopter pilots of the Dutch Defense Helicopter Command (DHC) is 20 %, and physical work exposures {{have been suggested}} as risk factors. Pilots and <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> perform different tasks when flying helicopters. The aims {{of the current study}} were to compare the exposures to physical work factors between these occupations and to estimate the 1 -year {{prevalence of}} neck pain in military helicopter <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members.</b> A survey was completed by almost all available helicopter pilots (n = 113) and <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> (n = 61) of the DHC. The outcome measures were self-reported neck pain and exposures to nine physical work factors. Differences in the proportions of helicopter pilots and <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> reporting being often exposed to the particular physical factor were assessed with the χ(2) test. The 1 -year prevalence of regular or continuous neck pain among <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> was 28 %. Significantly more <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> than pilots reported being often exposed to manual material handling, performing dynamic movements with their torsos, working in prolonged bent or twisted postures with their torsos and their necks, working with their arms raised and working in awkward postures. Often exposure to prolonged sitting and dynamic movements with the neck were equally reported by almost all the pilots and <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members.</b> Flight-related neck pain is prevalent in both military helicopter pilots and <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members.</b> The exposures to neck pain-related physical work factors differ between occupations, with the <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> subjected to more factors. These results have implications for preventative strategies for flight-related neck pai...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is a {{professional}} report that describes narratives and experiences taken from the real life of a <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member,</b> of a flight company, during the three phases of attention to passengers, which has been used, as inputs, to prepare a proposal to enhance the aviation company. Additionally, a survey was applied to a purpose sample of 40 participants. The origins {{of the role of}} a <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member,</b> the importance of such role for the security {{and the quality of the}} service offered to passengers were part of the results obtained. The proposal includes two main objectives: first, to enhance the image that the passengers have about the functions of a <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member,</b> through diffusion activities; and, second to recommend the inclusion of academic content in the formation plan and training of the <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> to be.

40|$|A {{hotly debated}} {{issue in the}} area of {{aviation}} safety is the number of <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> required to evacuate an aircraft {{in the event of an}} emergency.

Another issue of concern is the failure rate of exits and slides.
