25|$|Huntington {{had envisioned}} the work {{depicting}} {{a history of}} Spain, but the painter preferred the less specific 'Vision of Spain', eventually opting for {{a representation of the}} regions of the Iberian Peninsula, and calling it The Provinces of Spain. Despite the immensity of the canvases, Sorolla painted all but one en plein air, and travelled to the specific locales to paint them: Navarre, Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Elche, Seville, Andalusia, Extremadura, Galicia, Guipuzcoa, Castile, Leon, and Ayamonte, at each <b>site</b> <b>painting</b> models posed in local costume. Each mural celebrated the landscape and culture of its region, panoramas composed of throngs of laborers and locals. By 1917 he was, by his own admission, exhausted. He completed the final panel by July 1919.|$|E

50|$|Although {{considered}} a Hohokam rock art <b>site,</b> <b>Painted</b> Rock {{is on the}} extreme {{western edge of the}} Hohokam cultural area. East of Painted Rock, petroglyphs take on more typical Hohokam characteristics, while petroglyphs farther west take on more Patayan characteristics. Found here and in nearby areas of the Gila River are petroglyphs of Archaic origin. Painted Rock also bears the inscriptions of historic passers-by. Juan Bautista de Anza passed near here during his 1775-1776 expedition, followed by the Mormon Battalion in the 1840s, the Butterfield Overland Mail, and countless numbers of pioneers. During World War II, General George Patton used this area as headquarters for tank training.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dye {{mixtures}} containing henna, P-phenylenediamine (PPD), and indigo {{are applied}} to the skin {{in various parts of}} the world for religious purposes, social recognition or fun. AIM: To identify eventual allergens responsible for contact sensitization to skin decoration in three young children. Lesions remained strictly limited to the <b>site</b> <b>painted</b> during the summer holiday. None of the children had a previous history of contact dermatitis, but two of them suffered from severe seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. FINDINGS: Patch testing revealed severe contact hypersensitivity to PPD in all three patients, and one child presented a positive prick test to 1 % henna in water. The eruptions resolved following spontaneous elimination of the dyes and topical applications of corticosteroids, but left residual depigmentation. CONCLUSION: PPD is the main allergen identified in allergic reactions to decorative skin paintings. Peer reviewe...|$|R

5000|$|South Hobart is also {{famous for}} its Keen's Curry sign. Originally, the sign read [...] "VR 60" [...] to mark the Jubilee of Queen Victoria. This was created when the {{son-in-law}} of the company's founder [...] "purchased land {{in the foothills of}} Mount Wellington, overlooking Hobart, and in 1905 transformed it into a large advertising sign. Heavy stones were collected from the <b>site,</b> <b>painted</b> white and used to form the words 'Keen's Curry' in letters some fifty feet (15 m) high. Public uproar resulted, but Horace won the right to use it as an advertising sign. In June 1926 the familiar landmark briefly changed to read 'Hell's Curse' as a university prank, and students altered it again in 1962 to promote a theatre production. In 1994 the landmark read 'No Cable Car' as a protest against a proposed development. After every change the sign was restored and as of 2012 was still in place." ...|$|R
