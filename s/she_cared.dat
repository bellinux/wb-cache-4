Around 1859, William Washington {{relocated}} {{his family to}} a plantation at Falmouth in Stafford County, Virginia, located {{on the north side}} of the Rappahannock River across from Fredericksburg. Washington's father suffered from paralysis, and <b>she</b> <b>cared</b> for him from a young age.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros {{grew up in}} a well-off {{ranching}} {{family from}} Los Indios, Texas, and was married to David Cisneros, a surgeon from Brownsville. They had five children. She was a well-respected volunteer in the local medical community, and was president of the southern chapter of the Cameron-Willacy Counties Medical Society. The association where she volunteered helped raise funds for medical scholarships. In addition, people close to Cisneros said she was a practicing Catholic and that <b>she</b> <b>cared</b> a lot for her family. She volunteered at St. Joe, and was well-liked in the social group she was part of. Since Los Indios was mostly a ranching community close to the U.S.-Mexico border, Cisneros's religiosity was heavily influenced by curanderismo, a practice of religious and folk medicine healing rooted in ancient Mexican culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{family and}} {{household}} slaves resided {{on the second}} floor of the mansion, while others lived in the stable. As with everywhere else had they lived, <b>she</b> <b>cared</b> nothing about public life, and instead worked with Eliza and the other servants to create a home that welcomed extended family members and personal friends of the Houstons. Houston would occasionally hire out some of his labor force. The first child born in the Texas governor's mansion was also the last of the Houston children; Temple Lea Houston was delivered on August 12, 1860. This last birth left the 41-year-old Margaret debilitated for almost two weeks, with a watchful Houston constantly by her side.|$|E
5|$|When the Civil War began, Tubman {{worked for}} the Union Army, first as a cook and nurse, and then as an armed scout and spy. The first woman to lead an armed {{expedition}} in the war, she guided the raid at Combahee Ferry, which liberated more than 700 slaves. After the war, she retired to the family home on property she had purchased in 1859 in Auburn, New York, where <b>she</b> <b>cared</b> for her aging parents. She {{was active in the}} women's suffrage movement until illness overtook her and she had to be admitted to a home for elderly African Americans that she had helped to establish years earlier. After she died in 1913, she became an icon of American courage and freedom.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, Olga was in Russia at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, in which the Allied or Entente Powers including Russia, Britain and France fought against the Central Powers including Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. She decided to stay in Saint Petersburg and establish a military hospital to support the Russian war effort. Olga created a clinic at Pavlovsk Palace where <b>she</b> <b>cared</b> for wounded soldiers with her sister-in-law, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna. Other members of the imperial family, such as Princess Helen and Olga's granddaughter Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna founded field hospitals at the front. As the war continued, Olga {{became aware of the}} growing crisis in Russia, and attempted to warn Tsarina Alexandra in 1916 of the danger of revolution but the Russian empress refused to listen. A few weeks later, Olga attracted the fury of the Tsarina after signing a petition asking for a pardon for her grandson, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, who had been exiled to the Persian front for his involvement in the assassination of Alexandra's favorite mystic, Grigori Rasputin.|$|E

25|$|She {{maintained}} a highly theatrical lifestyle {{in her house}} on the rue de Rome. She kept a satin-lined coffin in her bedroom, and occasionally slept in it or lay in it to study her roles, though, contrary to the popular stories, she never took it with her on her travels. <b>She</b> <b>cared</b> for her younger sister who was ill with tuberculosis, and allowed her to sleep in her own bed, while she slept in the coffin.

25|$|She was {{the only}} {{daughter}} of Dr George Mitford, or Midford, who apparently trained as a medical doctor, and Mary Russell, a descendant of the aristocratic Russell family who grew up near Jane Austen and was an acquaintance of hers when young. At ten years old in 1797, young Mary Russell Mitford won her father a lottery ticket worth £20,000, but by the 1810s the small family suffered financial difficulties. In the 1800s and 1810s they lived in large properties in Reading and then Grazeley (in Sulhamstead Abbots parish), but, when the money was all gone after 1819, they lived on a small remnant of the doctor's lost fortune and the proceeds of his daughter's literary career. He {{is thought to have}} inspired Mary with the keen delight in incongruities, the lively sympathy, self-willed vigorous individuality, and tolerance which inspire so many of her sketches of character. <b>She</b> <b>cared</b> for her mother and father until their deaths and supported them and herself by proceeds from her writing.|$|E
25|$|From {{that time}} she was an indefatigable reader, troubling her parents only by her devotion to books {{rather than to the}} play natural to her age. Her father had a {{considerable}} library, the contents of every book in which she made her own, always preferring history, — before she had finished her 10th year being acquainted with Hume, Gibbon, Alison, and kindred writers. At this point, she was sent away to school. Her father and mother, seeing the intellect for which they were responsible, took all possible pains with her education, and fortunately her physical strength was sufficient to carry her through an uninterrupted course in different academies and a series of lessons with masters at home. <b>She</b> <b>cared</b> more for languages and natural sciences, in which she was very proficient, than for most other studies, and took no especial pleasure in mathematics. Booth's superior education was not given her at school, where she learned less than she did by herself, for she showed very young that disdain of obstacles and that taste for literature which were two strong points in her character. She was only a tiny child when she taught herself French. A stray French primer fell into her hands, and she became interested in spelling out the French words and comparing them with the English ones, and continued to study in this way. Later she acquired German in the same manner, and being self-taught, and not hearing either language, she never learned to speak them, but made herself so proficient in them in after years that she could translate almost any book from either German or French at sight, reading them aloud in English.|$|E

500|$|Laubenstein {{was also}} an outspoken AIDS activist and criticized the American {{government}} for what she saw as a reluctance to combat the AIDS epidemic. She was also critical of the Catholic Church for its treatment of lesbians and gay men. Some of her opinions caused controversy among other gay activists, such as her call to close gay bathhouses to discourage unsafe sexual behaviors and therefore reduce HIV transmission. Playwright Larry Kramer, who befriended Laubenstein after <b>she</b> <b>cared</b> for his partner, who died from AIDS, {{said that she was}} [...] "probably the first doctor to suggest that we [...] stop having sex altogether".|$|E
500|$|Tatiana {{was also}} fond of an officer named Vladimir Kiknadze, whom <b>she</b> <b>cared</b> {{for when he}} was wounded in 1915 and again in 1916, {{according}} to the diary of Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, a nurse who worked with Tatiana during the war. Chebotareva described how Tatiana sometimes sat beside [...] "Volodia" [...] at the piano as he played a tune with one finger and talked {{to her in a}} low voice, wearing a mysterious expression on his face. Chebotareva also described how Tatiana and her sister Olga made excuses to come to the hospital to see Volodia. Chebotareva felt the flirtations between the grand duchesses and the wounded officers could cause gossip and damage the girls' reputations.|$|E
500|$|Douglas {{was given}} an {{assignment}} in 1916 {{to write a story}} on the first woman to join the US Naval Reserve from Miami. When the woman did not show up for the interview, Douglas found herself joining the Navy as a Yeoman (F) first class. It did not suit her; she disliked rising early and her superiors did not appreciate her correcting their grammar as a typist, so she requested a discharge and joined the American Red Cross, where she was stationed in Paris. She witnessed the tumultuous celebrations on the Rue de Rivoli when the Armistice was signed, and <b>she</b> <b>cared</b> for war refugees; seeing them displaced and in a state of shock, she wrote, [...] "helped me understand the plight of refugees in Miami sixty years later".|$|E

500|$|Hill was short, {{like all}} her family, and {{indifferent}} to fashion. Her friend Henrietta Barnett wrote: [...] "She was small in stature with long body and short legs. She did not dress, she only wore clothes, which were often unnecessarily unbecoming; she had soft and abundant hair and regular features, but {{the beauty of}} her face lay in brown and very luminous eyes, which quite unconsciously she lifted upwards as she spoke on any matter for which <b>she</b> <b>cared.</b> Her mouth was large and mobile, but not improved by laughter. Indeed, Miss Octavia was nicest when she was made passionate by her earnestness." [...] Barnett also spoke of Hill's streak of ruthlessness. Gertrude Bell called Hill despotic. Later in Hill's life, the Bishop of London, Frederick Temple, encountered her {{at a meeting of}} the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and wrote, [...] "She spoke for half an hour … I never had such a beating in all my life." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1802, Cavendish's cousin John Ponsonby, Viscount Duncannon (her mother's sister's son), {{whom she}} had known her entire life, began to show romantic {{interest}} in her. Cavendish was unsure whether <b>she</b> <b>cared</b> for him enough, and they agreed to wait a year before deciding [...] "whether they liked each other well enough to marry". Their two families, especially his mother (and her aunt) Lady Bessborough approved of the match, but Cavendish was still undecided. During this period, John had romantic relationships with Lady Maria Fane and others; Cavendish presented an ultimatum that he [...] "must promise to cure himself completely of flirting, for she could not bear it". John angrily refused {{that he was not}} ready to marry her after all, nor [...] "bear rules to be prescribed to him by any woman living". He became engaged to Fane shortly thereafter. Her family later encouraged a match with another cousin John Spencer, Viscount Althorp, though, during her stay at Althorp, she stated that [...] "no reasonable woman" [...] could think of him as anything [...] "but as an eager huntsman".|$|E
500|$|As a child, Zelda Sayre was {{extremely}} active. She danced, took ballet lessons {{and enjoyed the}} outdoors. In 1914, Sayre began attending Sidney Lanier High School. She was bright, but uninterested in her lessons. Her work in ballet continued into high school, where she had an active social life. She drank, smoked and {{spent much of her}} time with boys, and she remained a leader in the local youth social scene. A newspaper article about one of her dance performances quoted her as saying that <b>she</b> <b>cared</b> only about [...] "boys and swimming." [...] She developed an appetite for attention, actively seeking to flout convention—whether by dancing the Charleston, or by wearing a tight, flesh-colored bathing suit to fuel rumors that she swam nude. Her father's reputation was something of a safety net, preventing her social ruin, but Southern women of the time were expected to be delicate, docile and accommodating. Consequently, Sayre's antics were shocking to many of those around her, and she became—along with her childhood friend and future Hollywood starlet Tallulah Bankhead—a mainstay of Montgomery gossip. Her ethos was encapsulated beneath her high-school graduation photo: ...|$|E
