In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} <b>sectional</b> <b>warping</b> to bend-twist {{coupling}} characteristics for box spar of wind turbine blade, section stiffness of different regions are calculated with weather considering warping effect or not, the results show that warping effects differently in different part of the blade and the length width ratio and thickness of spar cap are two factors that determine impact degree of warping. Section stiffness of a 5 MW blade box spar considering warping effect are calculated, bend-twist coupling coefficients are got. The results show that warping effect bend-twist coupling coefficient of box spar greatly and it should be considered when research the blade bend-twist coupling...|$|R

40|$|AbstractStructures of {{the open}} {{thin-walled}} profile are usually designed so to avoid twisting the individual elements. However, for some systems {{it is impossible to}} completely prevent twisting due to the torsion of a thin-walled open section, <b>sectional</b> <b>warping</b> due to tightness, additional sectoral stresses. The torsional stiffness of the thin-walled open section of the rod is much higher than their pure torsion rigidity. The structural analysis {{of the open}} thin-walled profile can be performed using a finite element shell. This requires careful selection and design of the grid partition and greatly increases the number of nodes and elements in the calculation scheme. Thin-walled rod finite elements can be used to calculate the complex spatial structures of a thin-walled open section with the account of clean and restrained torsion...|$|R

The displacement distribution in three directions along the thickness are derived respectively {{by use of}} the <b>sectional</b> <b>warping</b> corrective theory, and the hierarchical displacement functions are adopted in the width direction. Finally, {{based on the principle}} of virtual work, a special finite element model for boundary-layer effects is obtained.

The present model is simple while the degree of freedom is lower than that of the other numerical methods...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{effective}} structural analysis method for a space frame composed by thin-walled section beams by using finite element method. The coordinates {{transformation of the}} <b>sectional</b> <b>warping</b> displacements are considered in the present method. The effectiveness and verification of this method is shown through a fundamental example with perpendicularly crossed beams suffering the torsion moment by comparing the three dimensional plate element solution. And as application examples, the bending and torsion problem of space frames are solved by the present method and the obtained results are compared by the usual space frame solution. Y.

Fujii. 2 1 INTRODUCTION In the usual space frame structural analysis by finite element method, the St. Venant torsion's assumption is used as the torsional behavior of the composed members. The reason of this matter is one that the nodal displacement components in the local coordinates are easily transformed to ones i [...] ...|$|R
