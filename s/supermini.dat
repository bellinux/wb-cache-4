25|$|Top Gears 2005 survey {{rated the}} Polo {{as the third}} least {{satisfying}} <b>supermini</b> to own, with only the Fiat Punto and Rover 25 receiving a worse rating. It fell behind most of its crucial rivals, namely the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Corsa, Citroën C3 and Peugeot 206.|$|E
25|$|The Fiat Punto is a <b>supermini</b> car {{produced}} by the Italian manufacturer Fiat since 1993, spanning over three generations.

25|$|Although not a {{replacement}} for the 2CV, the AX <b>supermini,</b> a conventional urban runabout, unremarkable apart from its exceptional lightness, seemed to address the car makers' requirements at the entry level in the early 1990s. Officially, the last 2CV, a Charleston, which was reserved for Mangualde's plant manager, rolled off the Portuguese production line on 27 July 1990, although five additional 2CV Spécials were produced afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The Škoda Fabia is a <b>supermini</b> car {{produced}} by Czech manufacturer Škoda Auto since 1999. It is the successor of the Škoda Felicia, which was discontinued in 2001.

25|$|The Polo {{competed in}} the <b>supermini</b> sector with its new rivals like Austin Metro and Ford Fiesta {{and it was one}} of the largest {{superminis}} in production at this time, meaning that it was close to larger cars including the Ford Escort in terms of size, space and price. Within two years of its launch, however, it was faced with competition from a wave of new rivals, particularly the Fiat Uno and Peugeot 205.|$|E
25|$|Volkswagen {{launched}} the fifth generation Polo (internal designation Typ 6R) at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2009. For {{the first time}} in Polo's history, the car was declared European Car of the Year, for 2010.

25|$|In 1983, Peugeot {{launched}} the successful Peugeot 205 <b>supermini,</b> which is largely credited for turning the company's fortunes around. The 205 was regularly the bestselling car in France, {{and was also}} very popular {{in other parts of}} Europe, including Britain, where sales regularly topped 50,000 a year by the late 1980s. It won plaudits for its styling, ride and handling. It remained on sale in many markets until 1998, overlapping with the introduction of the 106 in 1991, and ceasing production at the launch of the 206, which also proved hugely popular across Europe.|$|E
25|$|Volkswagen {{entered the}} <b>supermini</b> market in 1975 with the Volkswagen Polo, a stylish and spacious three-door {{hatchback}} designed by Bertone. It {{was a strong}} seller in West Germany {{and most of the}} rest of Western Europe, being one of the first foreign small cars to prove popular in Britain. It had started out in 1974 as the Audi 50, which was only available in certain markets and was less popular. The Polo entered a market sector already being dominated by the Fiat 127 and Renault 5, and which before long would also include the Austin Metro and Ford Fiesta.|$|E
25|$|The Renault Clio is a <b>supermini</b> car (B-segment), {{produced}} by the French automobile manufacturer Renault. It was launched in 1990, and was in its fourth generation in 2012. The Clio has had substantial critical and commercial success, being consistently one of Europe's top-selling cars since its launch, and it is largely credited with restoring Renault's reputation and stature after a difficult {{second half of the}} 1980s. The Clio is one of only three cars, the others being the Volkswagen Golf and Opel Astra, to have been voted European Car of the Year twice, in 1991 and 2006.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{original}} Smart Fortwo, a sporty Smart Roadster, a limited production of 2000 erstwhile concept Smart Crossblade and a <b>supermini</b> Smart Forfour were also offered. These have now been discontinued. There were also plans to introduce the French made cross-over based {{on the body of}} the ForFour and the AWD hardware of the Mercedes C-class with the name of Formore but industrialization of this was cancelled at the 11th hour (even as tooling was being installed in the assembly plant) due to unfavourable exchange rate swings and spending cutbacks driven by losses elsewhere within Smart.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the return}} of high fuel prices in the 2000s and 2010s, GM's {{interest}} in truly small-car programs for the U.S. market has been renewed. As part of General Motors Company development, GM revived one of its idled U.S. factories {{for the production of}} a small car in Orion, Michigan, with the creation of 1,200 American jobs. This {{will be the first time}} ever that a large manufacturer produces a <b>supermini</b> vehicle in the United States. This retooled plant will be capable of building 160,000 cars annually, including both small and compact vehicles. Production started in late 2011 with the Chevrolet Sonic.|$|E
25|$|The Suzuki Cultus is a <b>supermini</b> car {{produced}} by the Japanese manufacturer Suzuki from 1983 to 2003, {{and it is now}} a rebadged Suzuki Celerio in Pakistan since 2017. It was first presented at the 25th Tokyo Motor Show, formally introduced to Japan in 1983 and ultimately sold in seven countries across three generations and marketed worldwide as the Suzuki Swift. An alliance formed in 1981 between GM and Suzuki (and Isuzu) allowed GM to market the Cultus as a captive import internationally under more than a dozen nameplates including the Geo Metro, Chevrolet Sprint, Pontiac Firefly and Holden Barina. It was also known as the M-car within GM.|$|E
25|$|By 1987, {{the company}} had dropped the Talbot brand for {{passenger}} cars when it ceased production of the Simca-based Horizon, Alpine, and Solara models, {{as well as the}} Talbot Samba <b>supermini</b> which was based on the Peugeot 104. What was to be called the Talbot Arizona became the Peugeot 309, with the former Rootes plant in Ryton and Simca plant in Poissy being turned over for Peugeot assembly. Producing Peugeots in Ryton was significant, as it signalled the first time Peugeots would be built in Britain. The 309 was the first Peugeot-badged hatchback of its size, and sold well across Europe. The 309's successor, the 306, was also built at Ryton.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Proton {{launched}} the three-door Proton Satria hatchback and the two-door Proton Putra coupé in 1997, {{both of which}} are based on the Wira platform and powered by the same range of Mitsubishi engines offered in the Wira, {{with the exception of the}} 2.0L diesel. The Proton Wira saloon and hatchback, and the Proton Satria and Putra were aggressively exported and marketed across the European Union and Middle East during the 1990s. The Proton Perdana, a premium D-segment saloon, was launched in 1995. It is based on the seventh generation 1992 Mitsubishi Eterna and was fitted with Mitsubishi's 4G63 2.0-litre l4 engine. It was offered with the superior 177bhp 6A12 DOHC 2.0L V6 engine after 1999. The Perdana remains the only D-segment, V6-powered car to be commercially produced by Proton. A Citroën AX-based 1.1-litre five-door <b>supermini</b> called the Proton Tiara debuted in 1996. It was the result of a joint venture between Proton and PSA Peugeot Citroën, a collaboration which was later abandoned after the death of Proton's then CEO, Tan Yahaya Ahmad in 1997.|$|E

2500|$|Renault had {{replaced}} its R5 <b>supermini</b> with a completely redesigned model (which had similar styling to the 1972 original) in 1984, but soon afterwards {{began working on}} an all-new <b>supermini</b> to take the company into the 1990s. It was eventually decided that the new car would feature a name designation, rather than the numeric model designations which Renault had traditionally used. Cars like the Fuego (launched in 1980) had been an exception to this rule, and the last [...] "numeric" [...] Renault was the 19, launched in 1988.|$|E

2500|$|The subcompact segment equates roughly to A-segment and B-segment in Europe, or city car and <b>supermini</b> in British terminology. [...] In 2012, the New York Times {{described}} the differences, saying [...] "today’s small cars actually span three main segments {{in the global}} vehicle market. The tiny A-segment cars include the Chevrolet Spark and Smart Fortwo. They are short and light. Slightly larger are B-segment cars like the Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Sonic. The A- and B-cars are known as subcompacts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, BMW {{set out on}} {{creating}} the production Mini. The first aspect that was considered was the design, which was chosen from 15 full-sized design studies. Five of these designs came from BMW Germany, another five from BMW Designworks in California, four from Rover and one from an outside studio in Italy. The chosen design was from BMW Designworks and was designed by American designer, Frank Stephenson. Stephenson penned the new Mini One R50 and Mini Cooper leading the team which developed the E50 car in Munich (parallel development in England by the team at Rover having been dropped in 1995). This design, being a city car, also fitted into BMW's plan of two compact cars, leaving the <b>supermini</b> class for the BMW 1 Series.
