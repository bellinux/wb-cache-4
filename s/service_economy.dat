5|$|Urban renewal {{projects}} and {{the transition to}} a <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> have resulted in strong economic growth in some parts of Northern England, but a definite North–South divide remains both in the economy and the culture of England. Centuries of migration, invasion and labour have shaped Northern culture, and the region retains distinctive dialects, music and cuisine.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the Arlington area {{historically}} relied on timber and agriculture, but has since transitioned to a <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> with some aviation industry jobs near the municipal airport. The city is governed by a mayor–council government, electing a mayor and seven city councilmembers. The municipal government also maintains the city's parks system and water and wastewater utilities. Other services, including public utilities, public transportation, and schools are contracted to regional or county-level agencies and companies.|$|E

The expansion of the aerospace industry in the Seattle region led Arlington to develop its own municipal airport into an aerospace job center, which includes {{a high concentration of}} Boeing subcontractors. , the airport has 130 on-site businesses that employ 590 people, with a total output of $94.5 million annually.|$|E
30|$|Obviously, {{these results}} {{can be used for}} {{predicting}} the future labor allocation dynamics of today’s developing countries, which satisfy condition (9). Model 1 a implies that these countries will become <b>services</b> <b>economies</b> at some time in future. Afterward, everything can happen according to Model 1 a, i.e., the economies may become agricultural or manufacturing economies again or remain <b>services</b> <b>economies</b> forever. In general, Model 1 a may be regarded as an ‘optimistic’ model, since it states that all economies (belonging to the group C) will become <b>services</b> <b>economies</b> at some point in time.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, like Model 2 a, Model 2 b {{does not}} state that all {{countries}} (belonging {{to the group}} C) must become <b>services</b> <b>economies</b> {{at some point in}} time, since Law 4 does not state that the services employment share must grow above 0.5. Thus, Model 2 b is consistent with the pessimistic view that some developing economies may never become <b>services</b> <b>economies.</b>|$|R
40|$|An era of {{industrialisation}} {{is making}} way {{for what has}} become termed the global <b>services</b> <b>economy</b> that is essentially characterised by uncertainty, discontinuous change, extensive competition, and complex contextual conditions. In this paper strategy and culture, as two interdependent domains of management are analysed, from a traditional scientific management and a complexity theory perspective, {{as a means of}} gaining a competitive advantage within the <b>services</b> <b>economy.</b> An important conclusion derived from the analysis is that organisational culture cannot be intentionally managed to support a specific strategy that is to be implemented, as it essentially is emergent in nature. At best unfavourable emergent cultural patterns may be disrupted and favourable patterns encouraged. This has significant implications for strategic management within the <b>services</b> <b>economy.</b> It is also suggested that the rational analytical models of strategy formulation and implantation, that assumes linear causality, are no longer deemed to be an effective response to the complex nature of the <b>services</b> <b>economy</b> and that an emergent strategic process is far better suited for dealing therewith. A central tenet underpinning such an approach is the emergence of a culture that facilitates participation and open-ended discussions, enabling participants to make-sense of contextual conditions that are arising at the peripheral edge. It is a process that entails looking at the emergent context from widely different perspectives and experimenting to find a possible innovative strategic response for gaining a competitive advantage in the global <b>services</b> <b>economy...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{primary sector}} of the economy {{accounts}} for most of the Falkland Islands' gross domestic product, with the fishing industry alone contributing between 50% and 60% of annual GDP; agriculture also contributes significantly to GDP and employs about a tenth of the population. A little over a quarter of the workforce serves the Falkland Islands government, making it the archipelago's largest employer. Tourism, part of the <b>service</b> <b>economy,</b> has been spurred by increased interest in Antarctic exploration and the creation of direct air links with the United Kingdom and South America. Tourists, mostly cruise ship passengers, are attracted by the archipelago's wildlife and environment, as well as activities such as fishing and wreck diving; the majority are based in accommodation found in Stanley. The islands' major exports include wool, hides, venison, fish and squid; its main imports include fuel, building materials and clothing.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} world's leading {{international}} financial centres, Hong Kong has a major capitalist <b>service</b> <b>economy</b> characterised by low taxation and free trade. From {{the second half of}} the 19th century and continuing into the first half of the 20th century, Hong Kong operated as a key command centre for the allocation of Asian capital in its broadest form. Hong Kong stature as an International Financial centre (IFC), gradually developed from the 1950s to become a key component of the island's economy. It is an important centre for international finance and trade, with one of the greatest concentrations of corporate headquarters in the Asia-Pacific region. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is the seventh largest in the world and has a market capitalisation of US$3.2 trillion as of December 2016. In 2009, Hong Kong raised 22 percent of worldwide initial public offering (IPO) capital, making it the largest centre of IPOs in the world and the easiest place to raise capital. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Hong Kong was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as London, New York City, Tokyo, San Francisco, Chicago, Sydney, Boston, and Toronto in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia after Singapore.|$|E

25|$|Upton was {{originally}} settled as an Anglo-Saxon farming community, and remained as a farming community until the village's rapid urbanisation and expansion from the mid-19th century.

40|$|This paper’s {{objective}} is twofold. Firstly, it presents {{the case for}} services-related policies in the current European Union (EU). The <b>services</b> <b>economy</b> is frequently misunderstood, due to old and new myths that stem from the classic economic tradition. These myths obscure {{the role of the}} <b>services</b> <b>economy</b> in economic development. Nonetheless, the European <b>services</b> <b>economy</b> faces specific problems, such as lack of market integration, which amplifies arguments that justify policy actions toward services within a framework where market and systemic failures do apply. Secondly, this paper focuses on existing services-policies at the EU level, paying special attention to the internal market for services policies and to the complementary role of primarily non-regulatory policies. Within a comprehensive policy framework, each individual policy will have a higher impact, improved implementation and easier acceptance. Synergies among services-related policies should be promoted; the internal market policies, enterprise and industrial policies, competition policies and regional policies may take the lead in such a framework. Since the Lisbon Strategy, services have begun to gain recognition in EU policy agendas. This paper attempts to increase their visibility and to highlight their crucial role in European integration and in economic growth and social welfare...|$|R
