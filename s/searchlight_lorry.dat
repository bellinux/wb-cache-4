25|$|Between 1937 and 1939, {{a number}} of {{military}} vehicles numbered from 151 to 162 were introduced. These were painted army green and consisted of a medium and a light tank, an Austin 7 military car, a six-wheeled truck, a reconnaissance car, a <b>searchlight</b> <b>lorry,</b> an anti aircraft gun, a light Dragon tractor with limber and 19 pdr gun. Most interesting were several fairly detailed trailers, including: amler, cooker trailer and water tank trailer. The military offerings were produced through 1941 though a few select models – the clever 161b Anti-Aircraft Gun, the 151a medium tank {{and some of the}} trailers – were also made again in 1946–1955 after the war (Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia).|$|E
