50|$|Retarding {{ignition}} timing reduces four-stroking, as it allows {{more time for}} scavenging to take effect. Two-stroke engines, when running at low power, are less sensitive to {{ignition timing}} changes than four-stroke engine. If the timing is retarded for low throttle positions, from perhaps 35° BTDC at normal speeds to TDC or even 10° after TDC at <b>slow</b> <b>idle,</b> the engine runs well without four-stroking. Opening up the throttle and simultaneously advancing the timing, allows a rapid pickup in speed. This system is widely used for outboard motors, particularly when used to pull water skiers.|$|R

40|$|Alterations of {{basal ganglia}} {{physiology}} in parkinsonism may consist of two elements, {{an increase in}} the firing rate of neurones and a change in the pattern of synchronisation of discharges between neurones. Recent findings suggest the presence of two principal modes of synchronised activity within the human subthalamo-pallidal-thalamo-cortical circuit, at 60 Hz. These oscillations are dynamically and systematically modulated by task, thereby suggesting a functional role in movement. More importantly, the two frequency modes are inversely affected by movement, consistent with opposing actions, and differentially expressed according to the prevailing level of dopaminergic activity. It is argued that the balance between these modes determines the effects of basal ganglia-thalamocortical projections on the motor areas of the cortex. The lower frequency oscillations facilitate <b>slow</b> <b>idling</b> rhythms in the motor areas of the cortex, whereas synchronisation at high frequency restores dynamic task-related cortical ensemble activity in the gamma band...|$|R
2500|$|Of all {{cylinder}} layouts without {{balance shaft}} a straight eight design has very low inherent vibration, while the side-valve layout contains {{the moving parts}} of the valve train within the cast-iron block, enabling it to be very quiet compared to an overhead valve configuration (as in the contemporary Buick engines). Combined with a substantial exhaust manifold and effective intake and exhaust muffling {{this can lead to}} a very quiet vehicle, both internally and externally. At the time of its use a quiet engine was thought to be a mark of quality in an automobile. Bores need be of small diameter to keep the engine length down and so strokes must be long to obtain larger displacements - such configurations (called [...] "undersquare") exhibit good low-rpm torque and are capable of <b>slow</b> <b>idle</b> speeds, enhancing both drivability and quietness.

40|$|Abstract — The {{effectiveness}} of a grid begins with the availability of its distributed resources. The challenge to ensure availability is maintainability. If these distributed resources are not being managed well, their availability would be affected and eventually reduces the overall {{effectiveness of}} the entire grid. In this research, we are keen to devise a self-management framework to automatically manage applications placement in a distributed environment to achieve higher availability and resiliency towards the event of resource failure. Thus, before we could perform applications placement in a distributed environment, we need to characterize the available resources. Resource could be characterized via benchmarking. However, conventional benchmarking objective is to evaluate the performance difference between idle machines. In this research, we performed resource characterization via benchmarking on a machine loaded with various amount of workload and capture {{the performance of the}} machine. The information generated from our resource characterization method showed that a <b>slow</b> and <b>idle</b> machine could perform better than a faster machine and heavily loaded with jobs...|$|R
40|$|By source-level IP packet burst, we mean several IP packets sent {{back-to-back}} {{from the}} source of a flow. We first identify several causes of source-level bursts, including TCP’s <b>slow</b> start, <b>idle</b> restart, window advancement after loss recovery, and segmentation of application messages into multiple UDP packets. We then show that the presence of packet bursts in individual flows can {{have a major impact on}} aggregate traffic. In particular, such bursts create scaling in a range of timescales which corresponds to the burst duration. Uniform “spreading ” of bursts in the time axis reduces the scaling exponent in short timescales (up to 100 - 200 ms) to almost zero, meaning that the aggregate traffic becomes practically uncorrelated in that range. This result provides a plausible explanation for the scaling behavior of Internet traffic in short timescales. We also show that removing packet bursts from individual flows reduces significantly the tail of the aggregate marginal distribution, and it improves queueing performance, especially in moderate utilizations (50 - 85 %) ...|$|R

[...] This was as frank an allusion to Christina Light as could have been expected under the circumstances; it seemed, indeed, to Rowland surprisingly frank, and a pregnant example of his companion's often strangely irresponsible way of looking at harmful facts. Roderick was silent sometimes for hours, with a puzzled look on his face and a constant fold between his even eyebrows; at other times he talked unceasingly, with a <b>slow,</b> <b>idle,</b> half-nonsensical drawl. Rowland was half a dozen times on the point of asking him what was the matter with him; he was afraid he was going to be ill. Roderick had taken a great fancy to the Villa Mondragone, and used to declaim fantastic compliments to it as they strolled in the winter sunshine on the great terrace which looks toward Tivoli and the iridescent Sabine mountains. He carried his volume of Ariosto in his pocket, and took it out every now and then and spouted half a dozen stanzas to his companion. He was, as a general thing, very little of a reader; but at intervals he would take a fancy to one of the classics and peruse it for a month in disjointed scraps. He had picked up Italian without study, and had a wonderfully sympathetic accent, though in reading aloud he ruined the sense of half the lines he rolled off so sonorously. Rowland, who pronounced badly but understood everything, once said to him that Ariosto was not the poet for a man of his craft; a sculptor should make a companion of Dante. So he lent him the Inferno, which he had brought with him, and advised him to look into it. Roderick took it with some eagerness; perhaps it would brighten his wits. He returned it the next day with disgust; he had found it intolerably depressing.|$|R
40|$|Florida {{manatees}} (Trichechus manatus latirostris) {{are known}} to winter in the warm coastal waters of South Florida and are especially attracted to the heated effluent from power plants. A portion of the Intracoastal Waterway within John U. Lloyd Beach State Park attracts manatees to its shallow mangrove-lined canals and warm outpourings from the Port Everglades power plant. Heavy boat traffic and the danger of manatee-boat collisions has resulted in no-entry zone sanctuaries and seasonal and year-round <b>slow</b> and <b>idle</b> speed zones, which have been created in coastal areas throughout Florida where manatees are frequently sighted. Unfortunately, even with these zones in place, boat strikes are still a problem in counties along Florida 2 ̆ 7 s coast. This {{study was conducted to}} obtain a characterization of speed zone compliance in speed zones around the Port Everglades power plant, Broward County, Florida. Objectives of the study were as follows: 1) Determine boater compliance with manatee speed zones based on miles per hour values; 2) Examine boat size, boat type, day of week, and time of day for effects on compliance and behavior; 3) Examine the effects of the presence of law enforcement vessels on compliance and behavior; and 4) Relate these results to the Florida Manatee Management Plan. The criterion by which boat speed is most often measured relates to wake size rather than a numerical value, and most regulatory signs in current manatee speed zones reflect this, using phrases such as ‘Slow Speed, Minimum Wake’ or ‘Idle Speed, No Wake’. To survey the speed of boats around Port Everglades, these speed definitions were converted to equivalent ranges of miles per hour values, providing a comparison for the speed of passing boats measured in miles per hour by a laser speed gun. To obtain a survey of boater behavior and test the effectiveness of the posted signs regulating boat speed in the area around the Port Everglades power plant, the speed of passing vessels was measured and recorded in miles per hour using Falcon Marine and Bushnell Speedster radar speed guns. Vessel speed was recorded from aboard a research vessel and from a position on land, situated so that the target vessel was within the range of the laser speed gun with an angle of incidence is 10 ° or less. Under these conditions the laser speed gun could accurately measure the speed of passing boats. Measures of boat speed in miles per hour obtained in the field were then compared to the ranges of speed in miles per hour that represent <b>Slow</b> and <b>Idle</b> speeds for this study.

The rheological properties and DOD drop formation dynamics of carbon black pigmented inkjet inks were investigated. It was found that the suspension microstructure responses to bulk motions, leading to shear rate and time dependent shear viscosity. However, DOD drop formation dynamics of highly pigmented inkjet ink and pure Newtonian fluid is similar even though shear rate up to 105 s- 1 exists during inkjet jetting process. A proposed explanation for these observations is that the shearing time during DOD drop ejection is insufficient for changing and stabilizing the microstructure of the suspension. The effects of signal amplitude and jetting frequency on DOD drop formation dynamics of pure Newtonian fluids were investigated. A transition of DOD drop formation dynamics when the inkjet nozzle is switched from <b>idle</b> to <b>jetting</b> was identified.

He, like Don Gayferos, [...] "forgot his lady fair and true," [...] and was only anxious about the expected visit of the Marquis of A----. Soothfast tidings had assured him that this nobleman was at length, and without fail, to honour his castle at one in the afternoon, being a late dinner-hour; and much was the bustle in consequence of the annunciation. The Lord Keeper traversed the chambers, held consultation with the butler in the cellars, and even ventured, at the risk of a demele with a cook of a spirit lofty enough to scorn the admonitions of Lady Ashton herself, to peep into the kitchen. Satisfied, at length, that everything was in as active a train of preparation as was possible, he summoned Ravenswood and his daughter to walk upon the terrace, for the purpose of watching, from that commanding position, the earliest symptoms of his lordship's approach.

The whole bore a resemblance partly to a castle, partly to a nobleman's seat; and though calculated, in some respects, for defence, evinced that it had been constructed under a sense of the power and security of the ancient Lords of Ravenswood.|$|R

Also, based on the selecting principle of evaluation index, selected performance indicators for the emission factors, and taken them into consideration while establishing the traffic signal timing model based on relative evaluation index system. Then, an improved real-coded genetic algorithm to solve the traffic signal timing model is presented. Lastly, the three algorithms are proved by {{a great deal of}} numerical calculation.

50|$|This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, {{operated}} by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever {{behind the steering wheel}} to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the clutch, engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the camshaft by a belt, the position of the butterfly valve in the carburettor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car <b>slowed</b> to the <b>idle</b> speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to standstill.|$|R

I wish to express, that we become tired of the task before we can comprehend the beauty; that we learn by rote before we can get by heart; that the freshness is worn away, and the future pleasure and advantage deadened and destroyed, by the didactic anticipation, {{at an age when}} we can neither feel nor understand the power of compositions which it requires an acquaintance with life, as well as Latin and Greek, to relish, or to reason upon. For the same reason, we never can be aware of the fulness of some of the finest passages of Shakspeare ("To be or not to be," [...] for instance), from the habit of having them hammered into us at eight years old, as an exercise, not of mind, but of memory: so that when we are old enough to enjoy them, the taste is gone, and the appetite palled.

40|$|The {{number of}} elderly {{people around the world}} is growing rapidly. This has led to an {{increase}} in the number of people who are seeking assistance and adequate service either at home or in long-term- care institutions to successfully accomplish their daily activities. Responding to these needs has been a burden to the health care system in terms of labour and associated costs and has motivated research in developing alternative services using new technologies. Various intelligent, and non-intelligent, machines and robots have been developed to meet the needs of elderly and people with upper limb disabilities or dysfunctions in gaining independence in eating, which is one of the most frequent and time-consuming everyday tasks. However, in almost all cases, the proposed systems are designed only for the personal use of one individual and little effort to design a multiple-user feeding robot has been previously made. The feeding requirements of elderly in environments such as senior homes, where many elderly residents dine together at least three times per day, have not been extensively researched before. The aim of this research was to develop a machine to feed multiple elderly people based on their characteristics and feeding needs, as determined through observations at a nursing home. Observations of the elderly during meal times have revealed that almost 40 % of the population was totally dependent on nurses or caregivers to be fed. Most of those remaining, suffered from hand tremors, joint pain or lack of hand muscle strength, which made utensil manipulation and coordination very difficult and the eating process both messy and lengthy. In addition, more than 43 % of the elderly were very slow in eating because of chewing and swallowing problems and most of the rest were slow in scooping and directing utensils toward their mouths. Consequently, one nurse could only respond to a maximum of two diners simultaneously. In order to manage the needs of all elderly diners, they required the assistance of additional staff members. The limited time allocated for each meal and the daily progression of the seniors’ disabilities also made mealtime very challenging. Based on the caregivers’ opinion, many of the elderly in such environments can benefit from a machine capable of feeding multiple users simultaneously. Since eating is a <b>slow</b> procedure, the <b>idle</b> state of the robot during one user’s chewing and swallowing time can be allotted for feeding another person who is sitting at the same table. The observations and studies have resulted in the design of a food tray, and selection of an appropriate robot and applicable user interface. The proposed system uses a 6 -DOF serial articulated robot in the center of a four-seat table along with a specifically designed food tray to feed one to four people. It employs a vision interface for food detection and recognition. Building the dynamic equations of the robotic system and simulation of the system were used to verify its dynamic behaviour before any prototyping and real-time testing...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of the study: The human {{sense of}} {{movement}} and balance integrates vestibular information with visual and somatosensory information. Research into the neural correlates of vestibular processing has been hampered because the subject must remain in a fixed position, and consequently neither magnetic resonance imaging nor positron emitted tomography are suitable methods. Therefore, research on the neural correlates of linear self-motion in humans has typically used visual vection, which is self-motion induced by large-field visual motion stimulation during which the stationary subject perceives the moving visual surroundings as being stable and themselves as moving. This study investigated the feasibility of acquiring electroencephalography (EEG) data during self-motion in human subjects. Electroencephalography {{would appear to be}} a suitable candidate for recording neural activity during motion because modern EEG acquisition equipment is lightweight and portable. Furthermore, a Stewart motion platform provides an appropriate method of producing linear self-motion in a laboratory environment. There are, however, a number of potential drawbacks to using a Stewart motion platform in conjunction with EEG recording equipment. For example, noise could be introduced into the EEG signal from the motion of the actuators, the electrical noise of the platform power source, or from muscular activity of the subject as they compensate for the acceleration at the start and finish of the motion. If achievable, this would allow a new method for investigation of vestibular processing and multisensory interaction. Understanding the contribution of different sensory modalities to the human senses of balance and movement is a key task for aiding the elderly, as the processing of vestibular signals deteriorates over time, which can lead to postural instability and falls. Method: Six subjects performed a visual oddball task â€“ designed to evoke a P 3 event-related potential (ERP) â€“ under four different motion conditions on a Stewart platform. The motion conditions â€“ stationary, <b>idle,</b> <b>slow</b> and fast â€“ were designed to ascertain if the Stewart platform produced electromagnetic noise which would mask EEG data. The P 3 task was chosen as it is relatively simple to evoke and can be tested using various experimental paradigms and sensory modalities, making it a robust measure. The P 3 task required the subject to respond when observing an infrequent visual stimulus. The visual stimuli were projected onto a large screen in the Stewart platform. EEG data were recorded using both a shielded system, the BrainAmp MRPlus, and separately using an unshielded Biosemi ActiveTwo system. Results: Reliable P 3 ERPs were found to be present under all motion conditions. The correlation among conditions during the interval - 100 ms to 600 ms of the ERPs was at least 0. 93. There were no artifacts caused by interference from the Stewart platform from both the shielded and unshielded systems. The number of rejected epochs was similar across all conditions. Conclusion: The results {{of this study indicate that}} reliable EEG data can be obtained during self-motion on a Stewart platform, and that the task-independent vestibular input did not interfere with the visually-evoked P 3 ERP. The Stewart platform did not introduce noise to the data. This finding is noteworthy for the ecological validity of further research into human motion...|$|R
