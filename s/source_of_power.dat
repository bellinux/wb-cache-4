5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E
5|$|In more derived {{orders of}} insects, such as Diptera (flies) and Hymenoptera (wasp), the {{indirect}} muscles occupy the greatest {{volume of the}} pterothorax and function as the primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> for the wingstroke. Contraction of the dorsolongitudinal muscles causes the severe arching of the notum which depresses the wing while contraction of the dorsoventral muscles causes opposite motion of notum. Other more primitive insects, such as Orthoptera (locusts), Coleoptera (beetles), and Odonata (dragonflies) use direct muscles {{that are responsible for}} developing the needed power for the up and down strokes.|$|E
5|$|Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek {{served as}} an area for {{settlers}} to establish homesteads and farms. As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek was a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, {{in what is now}} Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I focus on {{building}} {{a conceptual framework}} for {{an understanding of the}} changing dynamics of labour and workers’ <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> I begin by identifying worker action that draws on traditional <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> structural and associational power. I then show how the emergence of new forms of labour action is drawing on both old and new <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> New global forms <b>of</b> worker <b>power</b> are examined, and I conclude by suggesting that the missing dimension in the three <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> identified – structural, associational and societal – is institutional power. If these new initiatives are to be sustainable they will need to include one <b>of</b> labour’s traditional <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> institutional <b>power.</b> These four-fold <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> provide the basis for a strategy of union renewal in the age of globalisation...|$|R

It is a unitary state, containing forty-seven administrative divisions, with the Emperor as its head of state. His role is ceremonial {{and he has no}} powers related to Government. Instead, it is the Cabinet, composing of the Ministers of State and the Prime Minister, that directs and controls the Government. The Cabinet is the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> of the Executive branch, and is formed by the Prime Minister, who is the head of government.

The temple of Q'uq'umatz must have been completely dismantled very soon after the Spanish Conquest since it is not mentioned by any of the Colonial era visitors, and early drawings of the site show only vegetation where the temple once stood.

5|$|As {{political}} and economic power increasingly concentrated in Lima, the capital city, several administrations tried to decentralize the country with little success. The 1979 Peruvian Constitution contained provisions for the decentralization of power {{through the creation of}} autonomous regions, but they were not implemented. During the later years of the 19851990 presidency of Alan García, the government faced the prospect of losing the 1990 presidential elections because of a widespread economic crisis and faltering public support. As a way of creating an alternative <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> the regime established twelve autonomous regions on January 20, 1989 in the hope of winning some elections at this level. However, due to the haste of their creation, these regional governments were not provided with fiscal resources of their own so they depended on the goodwill of the central government for funding.|$|E

5|$|Energy {{beam welding}} methods, namely {{laser beam welding}} and {{electron}} beam welding, are relatively new processes that have become quite popular in high production applications. The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> Laser beam welding employs a highly focused laser beam, while electron beam welding is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam. Both {{have a very high}} energy density, making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing the size of the weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking. Developments in this area include laser-hybrid welding, which uses principles from both laser beam welding and arc welding for even better weld properties, laser cladding, and x-ray welding.|$|E
5|$|Plug-in {{cars have}} several {{benefits}} compared to conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. They have lower operating and maintenance costs, and produce little or no local air pollution. They reduce dependence on petroleum and may reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the onboard <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation to charge the batteries. Plug-in hybrids capture most of these benefits when they are operating in all-electric mode. Despite their potential benefits, market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles has been slower than expected as adoption faces several hurdles and limitations. The global market share of the light-duty plug-in vehicle segment achieved 0.86% of total new car sales in 2016, up from 0.62% in 2015 and 0.38% in 2014. However, the stock of plug-in electric cars represented just 0.15% of the 1.4 billion motor vehicles on the world's roads {{by the end of}} 2016.|$|E

John Fitch had launched the first rudimentary steamboat onto the Delaware River in the late 1780s, and the Philadelphia waterworks was by 1802 operating two low-pressure steam engines to pump water from the Schuylkill River, but these were rare examples and most instances of this new technology were {{to be found in}} Europe. Much of the development of steam power had occurred in Great Britain, with Thomas Newcomen and James Watt instrumental in developing and commercializing steam power there and elsewhere in Europe, with several hundred of machines operating there in industrial and labor-saving applications by 1800.|$|E

40|$|What {{resources}} grant {{heads of}} state and government influence in the European Council? Despite its political importance, the European Council has only been subject to limited research. Part of the explanation is the difficulties of conducting research on a political body that convenes behind closed doors, whose proceedings are undocumented, and whose participants are unusually hard to gain access to. This paper reports {{the results of a}} project designed to overcome the problems of previous research through a unique series of elite interviews with European {{heads of state}} and government.

5|$|Horses {{remained}} the primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> for agriculture, mining, transport and warfare, until {{the arrival of}} the steam engine. The Middleton Railway had been established for industrial use by an Act of Parliament in 1785; Parliament also allowed the construction of the Surrey Iron Railway, intended to carry goods, in 1801, and the Oystermouth Railway, later known as the Swansea and Mumbles Railway, in 1804. These initially used horse-drawn vehicles, but developments in steam engines made them cheaper to run than horses, and more useful as a source of locomotive power on railways. The Swansea and Mumbles Railway was the first to carry paying passengers, from 1807, and was soon followed by many others, with Parliament passing around one new railway Act per year until 1821. By 1840, numerous railway lines had been laid, forming networks such as that created by George Hudson; the number of rail miles expanded from 1,497 in 1840 to 6,084 by 1850, and horse-drawn passenger coaches became virtually obsolete over long distances.|$|E
5|$|The Gazel Ministry {{uses the}} Gaetia Key, an {{artifact}} that manipulates the DNA of {{massive amounts of}} humans around the world, turning them into mutants called Wels in order to collect flesh to reconstruct their god, an all-powerful Gear called Deus that crash-landed on the planet ten thousand years ago. During this time, Elly and Fei become romantically involved with each other. They learn {{that they are the}} reincarnations of Sophia and Lacan. Lacan was a painter while Sophia was the Holy Mother of Nisan {{around the time of the}} war between Shevat and Solaris five-hundred years earlier. Lacan blamed himself for Sophia's death during the war and, with the help of Miang, became Grahf and sought to destroy the world. Although defeated, he and Miang have transmigrated their minds into other humans since. Krelian and Miang dispose of the Emperor and the Gazel Ministry because they are no longer necessary and kidnap Elly, the Mother, who must be sacrificed in order to revive Deus. Miang is killed by an enraged Ramsus as he realizes he has been used, and Elly turns into Miang, becoming absorbed by Deus. Fei, as Id, attempts to make contact with the Zohar. Wiseman, who reveals himself to be Fei's father, stops him, giving peace to Fei's other personalities. Fei's gear transforms into the Xenogears and Grahf appears, revealing that he had been inside Fei's father's body. At this time, Fei makes contact with the Wave Existence—an extra-dimensional being who is trapped inside Deus and is the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> for all gears—and learns that he must destroy Deus to free humanity. Grahf tries to merge with Fei and is defeated.|$|E

40|$|As {{international}} retailers {{continue to}} employ franchising {{as a major}} method of market entry, the control of these international retail franchise networks becomes of significant importance. The aim {{of this paper is}} to examine the methods by which UK-based international fashion franchisors control franchisees and their international franchise businesses. The paper employs a qualitative methodology and a multiple case design. Six UK-based fashion retailers with international franchise operations form the empirical basis of the study. The franchise contract, support mechanisms, franchise partner selection, the franchise relationship and the use of master/area franchising were found to be the major methods by which international retail franchisors exert control over their franchise networks. While coercive and non-coercive <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> were identified in the form of the franchise contract and support mechanisms, the paper also identifies <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> relationship <b>power</b> and organisational power. The paper provides practical information to existing international franchisors and those firms considering the move into the international marketplace via the franchise mode of operation. By highlighting additional <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> in the form of organisational and relationship power, franchisors are offered further means by which to control their international businesses than hitherto identified in the international franchise literature. Traditional franchise research suggests that there is a dichotomy in the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> available to franchisors, that is, coercive or non-coercive <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> While acknowledging the existence and importance <b>of</b> these <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and their related methods of control, this paper adds further dimensions to the academic debate by introducing relationship power and organisational power. Therefore, franchise partner selection, the franchise relationship and the use of master/area franchising emerge from the qualitative findings as further control mechanisms available to international retail franchisors...|$|R
