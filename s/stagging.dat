40|$|In {{the third}} quarter of {{calendar}} year 1996, 13 days of combust-boiler tests were performed, including 3 days of tests on a parallel DOE sponsored project on sulfur retention in a <b>stagging</b> combustor. Between tests, modifications and improvements that were indicated by these tests were implemented. This brings the total number of test days to the end of September in the task 5 effort to 41, increased to 46 as of the date of this Report, 10 / 27 / 96. This compares with a total of 63 test days needed to complete the task 5 test effort. As reported previously, the only major modification to the Williamsport combustor has been the addition of a new downstream section, which lengthens the combustor and improves the combustor-boiler interface. The original combustor section, which includes the fuel, air, and cooling water delivery systems remained basically unchanged. Only the refractory liner was completely replaced, a task which occurs on an annual basis in all commercial <b>stagging</b> utility combustors.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the Fireside Performance Indices (FPI) {{research}} project at the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) {{was to develop a}} series of indices to reliably predict the fireside performance of subbituminous coals in utility boilers. Individual utilities must respond quickly and effectively to changing fuel markets because of competition within the U. S. coal-fired power industry. Spot-market purchases of coal have become commonplace. The economics associated with sulfur emissions control have caused many utilities to use Powder River Basin (PRB) subbituminous coals. The PRB coals usually provide a lower-cost, medium-heating-value, low-sulfur fuel option. Although these coals possess similar overall or bulk compositional properties, their fireside performance characteristics vary considerably within a given boiler. Consequently, bulk compositional parameters and, hence, conventional indices such as the base-to-acid ratio, <b>stagging</b> factor, and fouling factor are inappropriate for predicting the fireside performance of PRB coals. The development of the computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM) and chemical fractionation methods, however, has enabled a more thorough characterization of the inorganic constituents of PRB, coals that contribute to the following adverse operational effects: <b>stagging,</b> fouling, opacity, erosion and poor grindability, slag tapping, and sootblower performance. Eight predictive indices have been developed based primarily on CCSEM and chemical fractionation analysis parameters to predict the propensity of a given coal or coal blend to cause operational problems. The indices were formulated using bench-, pilot-, and full-scale combustion testing data from previous research projects combined with bench-scale data from this project to identify the primary coal inorganic properties that cause ash-related problems in utility boilers...|$|E

40|$|Successful {{operation}} of conventional {{as well as}} advanced coal combustion systems depends on controlling and minimizing the development of ash fouling and <b>stagging,</b> i. e., fireside deposits. The development of these deposits depends not only on combustion design and operating conditions, {{but also on the}} composition and quantity of the inorganic species in the coal. Coals contain several minerals, and low-rank coals contain organically associated cations that vary in their association, size, and position relative to one another and in their composition. In the course of combustion, the major inorganic constituents directly affect chemical and physical transformations, such that inorganic species are initially partitioned into gaseous, liquid, and solid intermediates. this report discusses the design and construction of an infrared emission sampling probe for ash deposits, and discusses the correlations of ash build-up with the emission spectra...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARYTuberculosis {{and lung}} cancer are two {{different}} diseases which can occur simultaneously, questioning the casuality of the association.

Commercialization of the use of coal combustion by-products in ceramics is more likely to become viable if a quality-assured product can be made, and predictive materials selection is a key component of a quality-assured product. The objective of this work was to demonstrate the development and production of a ceramic material utilizing coal ash as a key component.

40|$|Calcium oxide sorbents {{injected}} in a <b>stagging</b> combustor {{react with}} the sulfur released during coal combustion to form sulfur bearing particles, {{some of which}} are deposited on the liquid slag layer on the combustor wall. Since the solubility of sulfur in liquid slag is low, the slag must be drained from the combustor to limit sulfur re-evolution into the gas phase. The objective of this 24 month project is to perform a series of 16 one day tests to determine the factors that control the retention of the sulfur in the slag that is drained from the combustor. In the present quarterly reporting period, 10 days of combustor tests were performed, bringing the total number of tests performed to 15. A wide range of operating conditions were tested including injection of metal oxide powders to achieve total mineral injection rates in excess of 400 lb/hr at coal mass flow rates of around 1000 lb/hr. It was determined that efficient sulfur capture requires calcium oxide particle sizes that are too small to be effectively retained in the combustor. On the other hand, injection of coarse calcium sulfate particles into the combustor sharply increased the slag viscosity, thereby reducing the slag flow rate and causing substantial revolution of the sulfur in the slag. It is tentatively concluded that conditions necessary for sulfur capture with sorbents and its retention in the slag cannot be efficiently achieved in one step in a cyclone combustor. It is further concluded that due to the increases in slag viscosity by calcium sulfate extremely high slag mass flow rates are required for sulfur retention in slag. Further tests in that direction are planned for the next quarterly reporting period...|$|E

In our design consideration, we have tried to render all waste streams benign and if possible convert them to a commercial product. It appears that vitrified slag has commercial values. If the flyash is reinjected through the furnace, along with the dry bottom ash, then the amount of the less valuable solid waste stream (ash) can be minimized. A limitation on this procedure arises if it results in the buildup of toxic metal concentrations in either the slag, the flyash or other APCD components. We have assembled analytical tools to describe the progress of specific toxic metals in our system. The outline of the analytical procedure is presented in the first section of this report. The strengths and corrosion resistance of five candidate refractories have been studied in this quarter. Some of the results are presented and compared for selected preparation conditions (mixing, drying time and drying temperatures).

The project will also provide information to help in the design of new systems specifically configured to fire these clean coal-based fuels. The project consists of four phases: (1) design, permitting, and test planning, (2) construction and start up, (3) demonstration and evaluation (1, 000 -hour demonstration), and (4) expanded demonstration and evaluation (installing a CWSF preparation circuit, conducting an additional 1, 000 hours of testing, and installing an advanced flue gas treatment system). The boiler testing and evaluation will determine if the CWSF combustion characteristics, heat release rate, fouling and <b>stagging</b> behavior, corrosion and erosion tendencies, and fuel transport, storage, and handling characteristics can be accommodated in a boiler system designed to fire heavy fuel oil. In addition, the proof-of-concept demonstration will generate data to determine how the properties of a CWSF and its parent coal affect boiler performance. The economic factors associated with retrofitting boilers will also be evaluated.
