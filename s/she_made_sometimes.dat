60|$|When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: {{the same}} peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled me: I heard, too, her {{eccentric}} murmurs; stranger than her laugh. There were {{days when she}} was quite silent; but there were others when I could {{not account for the}} sounds <b>she</b> <b>made.</b> <b>Sometimes</b> I saw her: she would come out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter. Her appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest could attach. I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort.|$|E
50|$|Eureka was {{primarily}} a passenger boat, carrying very few cars. After 1929, though, <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>made</b> an extra run from the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco, carrying autos on Sundays.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do wish I had Siegmund's violin,' {{she said}} quietly, but with great intensity. Byrne glanced at her, then away. His heart beat sulkily. His sanguine, passionate spirit dropped and slouched under her contempt. He, also, felt the jar, heard the discord. <b>She</b> <b>made</b> him <b>sometimes</b> pant {{with her own}} horror. He waited, full of hate and tasting of ashes, {{for the arrival of}} Louisa with the coffee.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>made</b> uncredited {{contributions}} to Wood's artwork. One {{of the stories}} she worked on was [...] "Carl Akeley" [...] in EC Comics' Two-Fisted Tales #41 (February-March 1955). She did a number of animal drawings for that story.|$|R
5000|$|Wos {{resigned}} on August 15, 2015, stating in a {{press conference}} that it was [...] "simply time to go home" [...] and spend time with her family. Asked by the press if she would [...] "change any of the decisions that <b>she</b> <b>made</b> over a <b>sometimes</b> rocky tenure," [...] she replied [...] "not at all." [...] Wos was replaced by Rick Brajer, a former medical technology executive. After being sworn in, Brajer asserted to the press that Wos' resignation had been unrelated to the ongoing federal investigation into DHHS.|$|R
5000|$|The {{spring of}} 1963 saw {{her return to}} the Far East and, more specifically, to the waters off troubled Vietnam. Though American {{involvement}} remained small at that time, further intensified guerrilla activity in that country brought increasing numbers of American servicemen to Vietnam and warships to their support. Zelima provided logistic support to the latter. Following that visit in April and May, she resumed her normal routine for about 16 months. After the Gulf of Tonkin incident spurred an even more rapid acceleration in American involvement, Zelima's visits to the combat zone around the Indochinese peninsula became more regularized and frequent. By the latter 1960's, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> two, <b>sometimes</b> {{as many as three}} or four, replenishment visits per year to the ports and coastal waters of Vietnam bringing supplies to both ships at sea and men ashore. The war in Vietnam dominated the remainder of her career, for she went out of service almost three years before the conflict ended early in 1973. Her last tour of duty off the Vietnamese coast came in May and June 1969. Following a couple of months of active service, ...|$|R
50|$|After graduating Swarthmore College and {{spending}} a year {{working as a}} kindergarten teacher, Rubirosa joined the Manhattan District Attorney's office in 2004. Shortly thereafter, Rubirosa had a brief sexual relationship with her supervisor, Marcus Woll. She is promoted to Assistant District Attorney in 2007 under District Attorney Arthur Branch, and second-chairs for Executive Assistant District Attorney Jack McCoy. With McCoy's election to District Attorney (as of the eighteenth season), Rubirosa is assigned to newly promoted Executive Assistant District Attorney Michael Cutter. During {{the early months of}} this transition, <b>she</b> is <b>sometimes</b> <b>made</b> to be the unwilling mediator when her two superiors have disagreements regarding law.|$|R
6000|$|Occasionally {{when she}} had [...] "business" [...] to transact, Mrs Bowater would be off to London. There she would {{purchase}} for me any little trifle required for the replenishment of my wardrobe. Needing so little, I could afford the finest materials; my sovereign was worth at least sixty shillings. Rather than [...] "fine," [...] Mrs Bowater preferred things [...] "good"; and for this [...] "goodness," [...] I must confess, <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>made</b> rather alarming sacrifices of appearance. Still, I was already possessed of a serviceable stock of clothes, and by aid {{of one of my}} dear mother's last presents to me, a shiny Swiss miniature workbox with an inlaid picture of the Lake of Geneva on the lid, I soon became a passable needlewoman.|$|R
60|$|You {{probably}} {{do not know}} a great deal about that boat. It was the most important steamboat in the world. I was there and saw it. Admiral Harrington was there at the time. It need not surprise you, for he is not as old as he looks. That little boat was interesting in every way. The size of it. The boat was one [consults Admiral], he said ten feet long. The breadth of that boat [consults Admiral], two hundred feet. You see, the first and most important detail is the length, then the breadth, and then the depth; the depth of that boat was [consults again]--the Admiral says it was a flat boat. Then her tonnage--you know nothing about a boat until you know two more things: her speed and her tonnage. We know the speed <b>she</b> <b>made.</b> <b>She</b> <b>made</b> four miles---and <b>sometimes</b> five miles. It was on her initial trip, on, August 11, 1807, that <b>she</b> <b>made</b> her initial trip, when she went from [consults Admiral] Jersey City--to Chicago. That's right. She went by way of Albany. Now comes the tonnage of that boat. Tonnage of a boat means the amount of displacement; displacement means the amount of water a vessel can shove in a day. The tonnage of man is estimated by the amount of whiskey he can displace in a day.|$|R
60|$|The pretty mute was {{mistress}} of many little accomplishments, which the Countess had caused {{to be taught}} to her in compassion for her forlorn situation, and which she learned with the most surprising quickness. Thus, for example, she was exquisite {{in the use of}} the needle, and so ready and ingenious a draughtswoman, that, like the ancient Mexicans, <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>made</b> a hasty sketch with her pencil the means of conveying her ideas, either by direct or emblematical representation. Above all, in the art of ornamental writing, much studied at that period, Fenella was so great a proficient, as to rival the fame of Messrs. Snow, Shelley, and other masters of the pen, whose copybooks, preserved in the libraries of the curious, still show the artists smiling on the frontispiece in all the honours of flowing gowns and full-bottomed wigs, to the eternal glory of caligraphy.|$|R
60|$|Priscilla's gay and gadding {{existence}} {{had come}} to an abrupt end. Nowadays she spent almost all her time at Crome, cultivating a rather ill-defined malady. For consolation she dallied with New Thought and the Occult. Her passion for racing still possessed her, and Henry, who was a kind-hearted fellow at bottom, allowed her forty pounds a month betting money. Most of Priscilla's days were spent in casting the horoscopes of horses, and she invested her money scientifically, as the stars dictated. She betted on football too, and had a large notebook in which she registered the horoscopes of all the players in all the teams of the League. The process of balancing the horoscopes of two elevens one against the other was a very delicate and difficult one. A match between the Spurs and the Villa entailed a conflict in the heavens so vast and so complicated that {{it was not to be}} wondered at if <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>made</b> a mistake about the outcome.|$|R
60|$|If {{rooms are}} an {{indication}} of the characters of their occupants, Nelly Bryant came well out of the test of her surroundings. Nothing can make a London furnished room much less horrible than it intends to be, but Nelly had done her best. The furniture, what there was of it, was of that lodging-house kind which resembles nothing else in the world. But a few little touches here and there, a few instinctively tasteful alterations in the general scheme of things, had given the room almost a cosy air. Later on, with the gas lit, it would achieve something approaching homeliness. Nelly, like many another nomad, had taught herself to accomplish a good deal with poor material. On tour in America, <b>she</b> had <b>sometimes</b> <b>made</b> even a bedroom in a small hotel tolerably comfortable, than which there is no greater achievement. Oddly, considering her life, she had a genius for domesticity.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Portico was not {{a person}} of a nimble intellect; her mind moved vigorously, but heavily; yet <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>made</b> happy guesses. <b>She</b> saw that Georgia's {{emotions}} were partly real and partly fictitious; that, as regards this last matter, especially, {{she was trying to}} [...] "get up" [...] a resentment, in order to excuse herself. The pretext was absurd, and the good lady was struck with its being heartless on the part of her young visitor to reproach poor Benyon with a concession on which she had insisted, and which could only be a proof of his devotion, inasmuch as he left her free while he bound himself. Altogether, Mrs. Portico was shocked and dismayed at such a want of simplicity in the behavior of a young person whom she had hitherto believed to be as candid as she was elegant, and her appreciation of this discovery expressed itself in the uncompromising remark: [...] "You strike me as a very bad girl, my dear; you strike me as a very bad girl!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Father's Last Escape," [...] the {{concluding}} {{story of the}} novel, Schulz makes an explicit reference to Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis (Schulz helped his one-time fiancee translate Kafka's The Trial into Polish, a translation for which Schulz provided an introduction). The old man's business has been liquidated and all his functions and authorities taken over by wife or relatives. Even the pretty, young Polish maid Adela has gone and been replaced by Genya, [...] "anemic, pale, and boneless,…and so absent-minded that <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>made</b> a white sauce from old letters and invoices." [...] Father's response is to turn himself first into wallpaper, then a piece of clothing, and finally into a big crablike insect who — unlike Kafka's passive victim — runs around the house, searching endlessly for something. His wife can catch the creature in her handkerchief sometimes, but cannot hold him. One day, however, she must have managed because Father appears at lunch, as the main course, after which he escapes the table, never to be seen again.|$|R
60|$|Mary, at any rate, {{displayed}} {{a great degree}} of decision and energy in her management of public affairs, and in the personal exploits which <b>she</b> performed. <b>She</b> <b>made</b> excursions from castle to castle, and from town to town, all over Scotland. On these expeditions she traveled on horseback, sometimes with a royal escort, and sometimes {{at the head of}} an army of eighteen or twenty thousand men. These royal progresses were <b>made</b> <b>sometimes</b> among the great towns and cities on the eastern coast of Scotland, and also, at other times, among the gloomy and dangerous defiles of the Highlands. Occasionally she would pay visits to the nobles at their castles, to hunt in their parks, to review their Highland retainers, or to join them in celebrations and fêtes, and military parades.|$|R
6000|$|She {{tried to}} learn Karen, but never had time, {{and it was}} the less needful that a little Burmese was known to some Karens, and thus she could always have an interpreter. <b>She</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>made</b> mission tours to keep up the spirit of the Karens till Mr. Mason should be {{qualified}} to come among them. Her little George was carried by her attendants, and there is a note to Mrs. Mason, sent back from one of the stages of her journey, which shows what her travels must have been: [...] "Perhaps you had better send the chair, as it is convenient to be carried over the streams when they are deep. You will laugh when I tell you that I have forded all the smaller ones." [...] But there is scarcely any record of these journeys of hers, she was too modest and shy to dwell on what only related to herself; and though she several times, {{with the help of her}} Burmese interpreter, led the devotions of two or three hundred Karens, it was always with a sense of reluctance, and only under necessity.|$|R
60|$|The signora herself seldom {{cared to}} go out, {{for the reason}} that it was too cold in winter and too hot in summer. In the one season she clung all day to her wadded arm-chair, with her scaldino in her lap; and in the other season she found it a {{sufficient}} diversion to sit in the great hall of the palace, and be fanned by the salt breeze that came from the Adriatic through the vine-garlanded gallery. But besides this habitual inclemency of the weather, which forbade out-door exercise nearly the whole year, it was a displeasure to walk in Venice on account of the stairways of the bridges; and the signora much preferred to wait till they went to the country in the autumn, when she always rode to take the air. The exceptions to her custom were formed by those after-dinner promenades which <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>made</b> on holidays, in summer. Then she put on her richest black, and the Paronsina dressed herself in her best, and they both went to walk on the Molo, before the pillars of the lion and the saint, under the escort of Tonelli.|$|R

5000|$|Zhang Changpu {{was known}} for being a strict mother to Zhong Hui. <b>She</b> <b>made</b> him read {{extensively}} {{since he was a}} child and ensured that he was already well versed in the Confucian classics and other books by the time he grew up. When he was four, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> him read the Classic of Filial Piety. When he was seven, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> him read the Analects. When he was eight, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> him read the Classic of Poetry. When he was ten, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> him read the Book of Documents. When he was 11, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> him read the Yijing. When he was 12, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> him read the Spring and Autumn Annals, Zuo Zhuan and Guoyu. When he was 13, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> him read the Book of Rites and Rites of Zhou. When he was 14, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> him read the Yiji (易記) written by his father. When he was 15, she sent him to the Imperial Academy (太學) to learn from a wider range of sources. She once told Zhong Hui, [...] "When you read too much, you become tired of reading. When you become tired of reading, you become lazy. I was worried that you would become lazy, so I decided to make you read in a progressive manner. Now you're able to learn independently." [...] Zhang Changpu herself was also known for being well read, and she was particularly interested in the Yijing and Daodejing. She liked to quote Confucius's teachings and use them to educate her son and make him memorise them until he became so familiar with them.|$|R

About 1895 <b>she</b> <b>made</b> a portrait of Judge Robert William Wells (1795-1864) of Missouri.
