After a few more jump cuts in which they turn to the right and back again, the figure <b>stands</b> <b>still,</b> then looks to its left slowly.

For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure <b>stands</b> <b>still</b> with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E
5|$|Patrick Stewart {{sought a}} {{change to the}} script to have the crew defend the Ba'ku village {{in the manner of}} the Battle of the Alamo instead of fleeing into the mountains. Piller could not find a {{feasible}} way to include this in the script, and the budget ruled out the creation of Alamo-like structures in the mountains. Several titles were considered for the film as shooting approached. Star Trek: Where Time <b>Stands</b> <b>Still,</b> Star Trek: Forever and Star Trek: Beyond Paradise were all considered but were rejected. Piller's favorite was Star Trek: Sacred Honor, but the studio rejected this because they were concerned that it sounded too religious. When shooting began, the film was still called Star Trek IX.|$|E
5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} <b>stands</b> <b>still</b> while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing her head on his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E

500|$|The {{penguins}} start courtship in March or April, {{when the}} temperature can be as low as [...] A lone male gives an ecstatic display, where it <b>stands</b> <b>still</b> and places its head on its chest before inhaling and giving a courtship call for 1–2seconds; it then moves around the colony and repeats the call. A male and female then stand face to face, with one extending its head and neck up and the other mirroring it; they both hold this posture for several minutes. Once in pairs, couples waddle around the colony together, with the female usually following the male. Before copulation, one bird bows deeply to its mate, its bill pointed close to the ground, and its mate then does the same.|$|E
500|$|Despite his intentions, Moore {{admitted}} in November 1986 {{that there were}} likely to be delays, stating that he was, with issue five on the <b>stands,</b> <b>still</b> writing issue nine. Gibbons mentioned that {{a major factor in the}} delays was the [...] "piecemeal way" [...] in which he received Moore's scripts. Gibbons said the team's pace slowed around the fourth issue; from that point onward the two undertook their work [...] "just several pages at a time. I'll get three pages of script from Alan and draw it and then toward the end, call him up and say, 'Feed me!' And he'll send another two or three pages or maybe one page or sometimes six pages." [...] As the creators began to hit deadlines, Moore would hire a taxi driver to drive 50miles and deliver scripts to Gibbons. On later issues the artist even had his wife and son draw panel grids on pages to help save time.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{generally}} responded {{positively to}} [...] "A Quiet Night In". David Chater, writing for The Times, gave a highly laudatory review, saying the episode was [...] "the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen {{for as long}} as I can remember– one of those fabulous programmes where time <b>stands</b> <b>still</b> and the world around you disappears". He chose not to reveal too much about the plot for fear of [...] "spoiling the fun". Chater later described the episode as [...] "mindboggling in its originality", and [...] "one of the funniest, most imaginative programmes shown on television in the past 15 years". Jane Simon, writing for the Daily Mirror, called the episode a [...] "triumph", while writers for Metro described the episode as [...] "quality comedy", and journalists writing for The Sunday Times characterised it as a [...] "brilliantly conceived and choreographed mime". Jack Seale, writing for the Radio Times, also stressed how the episode was [...] "beautifully choreographed", praising Pemberton and Shearsmith's [...] "willingness to attempt difficult concepts".|$|E
500|$|A. O. Scott of The New York Times was not {{impressed}} with Reeves' performance, commenting that [...] "even Klaatu looks bored and distracted, {{much as he}} did back when we knew him as Neo." [...] William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave the film a B minus and wrote, [...] "It's a decent enough stab at being what the old movie was to its time, following the same basic plot, full of respectful references to its model, updated with a gallery of fairly imaginative special effects." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars and noted that the film had [...] "taken its title so seriously that the plot <b>stands</b> <b>still</b> along with it", but also stated that it was [...] "an expensive, good-looking film that is well-made by Scott Derrickson". Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two stars and wrote in her review she felt the film was [...] "musty and derivative" [...] and thought its only bright spot was 10-year-old Jaden Smith's [...] "engaging, lively performance".|$|E
500|$|On 18 January 2007, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin {{presented}} Pinter with France's highest civil honour, the Légion d'honneur, at {{a ceremony}} at the French Embassy in London. [...] De Villepin praised Pinter's poem [...] "American Football" [...] (1991) stating: [...] "With its violence and its cruelty, {{it is for me}} one of the most accurate images of war, one of the most telling metaphors of the temptation of imperialism and violence." [...] In response, Pinter praised France's opposition to the war in Iraq. [...] M. de Villepin concluded: [...] "The poet <b>stands</b> <b>still</b> and observes what doesn't deserve other men's attention. Poetry teaches us how to live and you, Harold Pinter, teach us how to live." [...] He said that Pinter received the award particularly [...] "because in seeking to capture all the facets of the human spirit, [...] works respond to the aspirations of the French public, and its taste for an understanding of man and of what is truly universal". Lawrence Pollard observed that [...] "the award for the great playwright underlines how much Mr Pinter is admired in countries like France as a model of the uncompromising radical intellectual".|$|E

500|$|Many critics responded very {{positively}} to Inside No. 9. After the final {{episode of the}} first series, the comedic critic Bruce Dessau said on his website that it had [...] "really set an early benchmark to beat for comedy of the year. It has been consistently compelling as each week we entered an entirely different world." [...] On the same day, David Chater, writing in The Times, said of the series as a whole that [...] "t's hard to know which to admire more – the rich and perverse imaginations of Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith or the extraordinary range of acting talent that has brought this strange and memorable series to life." [...] Chater had previously described [...] "A Quiet Night In", the second episode of Inside No. 9, as [...] "the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen {{for as long as}} I can remember – one of those fabulous programmes where time <b>stands</b> <b>still</b> and the world around you disappears". Mark Jones (The Guardian) considered the whole series, saying that the Inside No. 9 was [...] "never less-than-captivating", while a review in the Liverpool Echo described every episode as [...] "intriguing and lovingly-crafted", though it was felt that the first three episodes were stronger than the latter three. In December 2014, Metro television critic Keith Watson named Inside No. 9 the twentieth best television programme of 2014, and in January 2015, Daily Star Sunday columnist Garry Bushell named Inside No. 9 the best comedy TV programme of 2014.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} work by Shinichirō Watanabe on Cowboy Bebop, the first image {{that came to}} him was of Spike. Prior to that, Watanabe had the {{character}} of Spike in mind {{for a long time}} beforehand. From that point on, Watanabe [...] "tried to build a story around him, trying to make him cool." [...] Watanabe created Spike as a mirror image of himself: in Watanabe's words, [...] "I don't smoke or drink or fight, but I want to – so Spike does." [...] Spike forms the main focus on the series, with the central theme being his past and its karmic effect on him. Spike was portrayed as a [...] "typical old-style Japanese man", who would simply do what he wanted and expect others to follow his lead and watch him from the sidelines. Spike's artificial eye was included as Watanabe wanted his characters to have flaws. He was originally going to give Spike an eye patch, but the producers vetoed it. In order to portray him as cool, Toshihiro Kawamoto designed Spike to look [...] "uncool": when he <b>stands</b> <b>still,</b> he has a hunched appearance. This meant that when the character was moving vigorously, he came across as [...] "extra cool". Spike's appearance was primarily based on the main protagonist of Tantei Monogatari, portrayed by famous Japanese actor Yusaku Matsuda. Although Yamadera was a fan of Matsuda's, he avoided imitating his distinctive manner of speaking, noting that it [...] "wouldn't have sounded right" [...] for Spike. Spike's Swordfish II spaceship was created by mecha designer Kimitoshi Yamane. Yamane liked the English biplane torpedo-bomber Fairey Swordfish, which led him to name the Swordfish II after the bomber. The conclusion of Spike's story and his final battle with Vicious were planned by Watanabe well in advance, with each episode featuring them meant to shadow their final confrontation. Some of the staff were unhappy about this approach as a continuation of the series would be difficult. While he considered altering the ending, he eventually settled with his original idea.|$|E
