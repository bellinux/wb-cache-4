The cost of third party ISO 14001 standard registration can be extremely high, and generally beyond the means of <b>SMEs.</b> Three <b>dimensions</b> to ISO 14001 EMS standard registration, which can substantially affect the cost associated with developing, implementing and obtaining ISO 14001 accreditation, were examined: i) whether the EMS implementation and registration process is direct or indirect; ii) how an organization can demonstrate compliance with ISO 14001 requirements; and iii) scale of the ISO 14001 certification process. In addition, case studies are used to highlight important ISO 14001 certification considerations, and assess how the organizations studied mitigated {{the high cost of}} ISO 14001 registration...|$|R

Even {{if there is}} a wide body of the literature on this topic, some areas are still under researched; in particular market-oriented networks among SMEs and network dynamics as well are some aspects that deserve further studies. In particular, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to fill these gaps by understanding how managerial and organizational factors can help a successful network formation and development. This paper adopts an explorative case study approach comparing two networks of <b>SMEs</b> along different <b>dimensions.</b> Drawing both from the literature and from the field, a framework of analysis has been created in order to carry out a structured investigation.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{globalization}} and international competition, reduced profit margins {{made it difficult for}} companies whether they are in physical or service sector. Parallel to this, customer oriented production became the key of success for companies. In other words, it is not possible for companies not being able to meet consumer needs and wants to compete efficiently. Therefore, the measurement of service quality depends to what extent the customer expectations are met. In this respect, this study aims to measure service quality of commercial banks towards Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Northern Cyprus using SERVQUAL model developed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry. As a brief summary of the study, commercial banks in Northern Cyprus have not met the service expectations of <b>SMEs</b> for all <b>dimensions.</b> Among the dimensions of service quality highest negative gap belongs to empathy. Furthermore, Relative importance (weights) of quality <b>dimensions</b> stated by <b>SMEs</b> is highest for reliability...|$|R

Achieving and maintaining competitiveness {{can be done with}} different strategies and tools. One of them is also outsourcing. Outsourcing is widespread throughout the world and represents a commonly accepted business practice. An important feature of outsourcing is that it is determined by several characteristics at the same time. Since outsourcing is a multidimensional phenomenon, we examined it’s most important and distinctive dimensions, including share of outsourcing particular activity, duration of the outsourcing contract, and number, size and location of outsourcing providers. For the purpose of research we have examined which activities are companies outsourcing and divide them on core and supportive activities. On this ground we studied differences in particular characteristics between those two groups of activities. The paper is based on empirical study of 154 Slovenian SMEs concluded in 2008. Its findings are presented in the paper. outsourcing, activities, <b>dimensions,</b> <b>SMEs...</b>|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} focused {{on a set of}} concerns regarding the role of SME senior manager in planning/development of initiatives directed towards quality continuous improvement. These concerns ended up in the research’s main focus and got materialized throughout the following purposes: (i) to explore the relationship between senior managers’ characteristics within SME, and firms’ propensity to develop quality improvement programs’ implementation; (ii) to compare leadership related initiatives in small firms to those from medium-sized ones. Attending to these purposes and other arguments and concerns highlighted throughout research focusing on both SME and quality management literature, the following hypotheses were formulated: (i) Senior managers with specific training in quality management themes play a role more preponderant in planning and performing quality improvement programs; (ii) Among <b>SME,</b> firms’ <b>dimension</b> influences leadership related initiatives. For this purpose, a questionnaire based, on previous case studies and a deep literature review focused on quality management and SME management was mailed to 600 Portuguese SME randomly selected from the pan-European AMADEUS database. From the sample, around 16 % of questionnaires were completed and returned. Results suggest that if some specific characteristics, like senior manager’s nature, time running the business, or his participation or not in SME creation, doesn’t seem to influence firms’ propensity to quality improvement; some other characteristics may play a significant role. For example, factors like age or specific training on quality management may determine, or at least influence, somehow, senior manager’s attitude and commitment towards quality improvement. Furthermore, attending to SME hierarchical structure characteristics, leadership issues assume high importance in quality improvement practices in such organizations. Moreover, results suggest that current leadership initiatives assume a higher preponderance in smaller firms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{the current}} economy of {{increasing}} global competition, many organizations {{are attempting to}} use knowledge {{as one of the}} means to gain sustainable competitive advantage. Besides large organizations, the success of SMEs can be linked to how well they manage their knowledge. Despite the profusion of research about knowledge management within large organizations, fewer studies tried to analyze KM in SMEs. This research proposes a new framework showing the determinant role of organizational dimensions onto KM approaches. The paper and its propositions are based on a literature review and analysis. In this research, personalization versus codification, individualization versus institutionalization and IT-based versus non IT-based are highlighted as three distinct dimensions of knowledge management approaches. The study contributes to research by providing a more nuanced classification of KM approaches and provides guidance to managers about the types of KM approaches that should be adopted based on the size, geographical dispersion and task nature of SMEs. To the author’s knowledge, the paper is {{the first of its kind}} to examine if there are suitable configurations of KM approaches for <b>SMEs</b> with different <b>dimensions.</b> It gives valuable information, which hopefully will help SME sector to accomplish KM...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{increase}} understanding of the internationalization of family firms; to investigate how the framework by Bell et al. on the internationalization patterns of firms could explain the internationalization pathways taken by family-owned small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); and to identify typical patterns and features in the various pathways taken by family-owned SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports findings from an in-depth multiple case study with eight Finnish family-owned SMEs. Findings: The ownership structure had the most important role in defining the internationalization pathways followed by the family-owned SMEs: a fragmented ownership structure led to traditional internationalization pathway whereas a concentrated ownership base led to born global or born-again global pathways. Practical implications: Family entrepreneurs should carefully consider the division of ownership and seek to build new relationships in foreign markets, in addition to their primary co-operators. Originality/value: The authors extend the integrative model of small firm internationalization by Bell et al. toward family-owned SMEs and highlight the most important dimensions in the different internationalization pathways of family <b>SMEs.</b> The ownership <b>dimension</b> is integrated within discussion on differing internationalization pathways. The authors utilize a family business specific perspective (the stewardship perspective), in order to understand the specific features of internationalization among family SMEs, and also how these features differ between family SMEs and other firms...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to a better understanding of internationalization patterns among speciality food small to medium-sized enterprises (<b>SMEs),</b> investigating <b>dimensions</b> that may have a bearing on such patterns, using a series of case studies. In particular the investigation seeks to gain new insights about differences among companies in their internationalization patterns. These differences are examined in a framework which tries to relate three company-level dimensions (market, technology and space) to internationalization patterns. The three dimensions are derived from the constructs developed by Storper and Salais, and Straete. Design/methodology/approach – Two research questions (RQs) are formulated: Is there a relationship between the internationalization pace of speciality food SMEs and their technology, market, and space dimensions? Is there a relationship between the internationalization modes of speciality food SMEs and their technology, market, and space dimensions? A qualitative approach was adopted and cases from a broad dataset were used. The present research is an explorative research: it is intended to provide insights from which hypotheses might be developed. Findings – This paper provides an empirical and conceptual contribution to the food internationalization debate. On the empirical side, it provides new evidence on speciality food internationalization, showing a rather diversified set of internationalization patterns, both in terms of pace and modes. On the conceptual side, it shows that the three dimensions of technology, market and space may help to enrich the comprehension of internationalization phenomena. While data collected seem not to provide insights from which hypotheses might be developed concerning RQ 1, they seem on the contrary to provide useful insights concerning RQ 2. Research limitations/implications – Limitations of the research generally relate to the use of a small sample. Future research should strive to obtain larger samples, develop a set of relevant finer-grained hypotheses and test those using appropriate statistical techniques Practical implications – Identifying the impact that the three dimensions might have on internationalization patterns and vice versa may help to focus on these specific elements when companies make their internationalization decisions. On the same line, public policy agencies could benefit from these first results for better clustering companies targeting their internationalization supporting initiatives. Originality/value – The findings add to the limited body of knowledge on the key influences on internationalization patterns within the food sector...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{performance}} and strategy of small EU banks and their relationship with their target market segments: Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) and private households. Three distinct lines of research are pursued. We start with an investigation of whether small EU banks benefit from diversification within and across business lines, and the impact that the regulatory environment has on such diversification strategies. Second, we examine the determinants of bank financing relationships for SMEs from a bank, <b>SME</b> and regional <b>dimension.</b> Following this, we investigate {{the evolution of the}} funding strategies adopted by small EU banks and analyse whether customer deposits are still a key funding source in their overall strategic focus. We present robust evidence that small EU banks do not benefit from direct diversification benefits within and across business lines and an inverse association between non-interest income and bank performance is observed. Bank and firm level variables are found to have both negative and positive impacts on SME bank financing relationships, with the regional growth and financial system variables showing that relationship banking can be affected by the market and socio-economic structure of specific European regions. Customer deposits are still featuring strongly within EU small banks' balance sheets and are still the main driver in their provision of loans to SMEs/households which confirms the importance of such banks in the economic growth of regional Europe. Against a background of increasing consolidation in European banking systems and significant changes in the regulatory environment within which financial institutions operate, our analyses suggest small EU banks still have a major role to play in the European financial arena.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{influence}} that adopting open innovation (OI) has on the innovativeness and performance of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper also examines the adoption of OI within a firmâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s practices and models, and within the three dimensions of firm sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data from 48 specialized SMEs manufacturing supercars were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. SmartPLS software was used to conduct a path analysis and test the proposed framework. Findings: The findings suggest that high adoption of OI models tends to increase firm innovativeness. Similarly, the adoption of OI practices has a positive effect on innovativeness but to a lesser extent than OI models. The moderation results of innovativeness further show that OI models and practices can benefit the performance of <b>SMEs.</b> Specifically, two <b>dimensions</b> of performance â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 environmental and social performance â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 were found to be greatly influenced by OI. Research limitations/implications: Due to parsimony in the investigated model, this study only focuses on OI adoption as practices and models without considering its drivers or other contingency factors. Practical implications: This paper could help practitioners in SMEs better understand the benefits of adopting OI to be more innovative but also more sustainable. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature on the role of OI practices and models regarding the dimensions of firm sustainability performance by being the first paper to investigate this relationship in the context of small and medium manufacturers of supercars...|$|R
40|$|Strategy {{process has}} been widely publicised {{during the last three}} decades, but what has been {{accomplished}} by strategy management literature in manufacturing small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) ? The application of strategy management in manufacturing SME practices can be seen as posing particular challenges. It is argued in literature {{that there is a need}} to understand whether and how managers in manufacturing SMEs have taken up the language and practice of planning, strategic analysis and execution. This research suggests a process and activity based approach to look at the practice of strategy management in SMEs in order to tackle this challenge. This exploratory study based on four comprehensive case studies investigates the strategy stories via exploring key strategic initiatives and activities, how they link together and which strategy tools, methods and techniques are used. This research concludes that a process based approach is useful and valid to understand strategy in SMEs because this view decomposes the process phases into activities which managers are more comfortable to talk through. However, we need to understand SME managers' language around strategising. There is an indication that if we change the language of SME managers, the findings of this study would map onto main stream strategy management theory clearly. It is found that the dynamics of the manufacturing SME strategy process have both emergent and planned <b>dimensions.</b> <b>SME</b> managers execute the strategy process mainly from an informal fashion by holding multiple functions and with limited application of strategy management methods and techniques. At an activity level, SMEs seem to be putting more emphasis on external environmental scanning (customers, suppliers, competitors, universities and lenders) and defining grand strategy and goals. This implies that SME strategy process is characterised by market based orientation, opportunity seeking and strategic awareness rather than resources or core competencies/ capabilities. Although this study's findings may be criticised because they are grounded on four companies, robust dimensions and insights into dynamics of the strategy process in manufacturing SMEs are achieved through saturation among emergent themes in data...|$|R
