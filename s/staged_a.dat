40|$|Transurethral {{resection}} of {{the prostate}} was performed on 584 consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed benign prostatic hyperplasia between April 2001 and July 2007. Pathological examinations revealed prostatic cancer in 30 (5. 1 %) of them. Seventeen patients had <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 1, and 13 <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 2 cancer. Prostatic biopsy was performed on 7 patients. The mean patient age was 69. 4 years (range 60 - 78 years) for <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 1 cancer and 76. 6 years (range 62 - 90 years) for <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 2. The mean serum PSA concentration was 8. 9 ng/ml (range 1. 18 - 41. 3 ng/ml) for <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 1 cancer and 9. 55 ng/ml (range 2. 0 - 23. 9 ng/ml) for <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 2. The mean follow-up period was 25. 8 months (range 3 - 82 months) for <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 1 cancer and 27. 3 months (range 1 - 82 months) for <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 2. In <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 1, all patients had a Gleason sum of 6 or less. In <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 2, 11 patients had a Gleason sum of 7 and 2 patients were 8 or more. Total prostatectomy was performed on 2 patients and no therapy on 15 patients with <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 1. Endocrine therapy was given to 1 patient, radiation therapy to 1 patient and no therapy to 11 patients with <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 2. Adjuvant therapy was given to 2 patients with <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 1 and to no one with <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 2.

40|$|Between 1972 and 1986, 134 {{patients}} with <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> {{carcinoma of the}} prostate (CAP) were diagnosed at a single Veterans Administration medical centre and followed annually by the hospital tumour registry. Seventy-four were classified as <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 1, defined as non-palpable, well-differentiated CAP, regardless of amount, found unexpectedly on transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Twenty-eight were classified as <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 2, defined as non-palpable, moderately or poorly differentiated CAP, regardless of amount, found unexpectedly on TURP. The remaining 32 were reclassified as atypical hyperplasia/adenosis (AH/A) rather than CAP. The survival of each group was compared with the survival of a control group from the same medical centre who had TURPs showing histologically proven benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Survival and tumour progression were similar for {{patients with}} <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 1 CAP, AH/A and BPH. Furthermore, patients with <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 1 CAP, with or without therapy, had similar survivals as patients with BPH in each age group (under 65, 65 - 74 and over 74 years). <b>Stage</b> <b>A</b> 2 CAP {{was associated with a}} significantly worse survival and more tumour progression.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{progressive}} factors for incidental {{carcinoma of the}} prostate of 38 patients. Effects of anti-androgen drugs {{for the development of}} incidental carcinoma were examined. There were no statistical differences with age, tumor size, histopathological grade, or invasion of BPH capsule. However, the tumor progression rate was high for a tumor size of more than 10 mm or poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Therefore, tumor progression was related with tumor size and histopathological grade. Of 15 patients with <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 1 disease, two patients had tumor progression. Patients with <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 1 disease are being followed with no treatment, but radical treatment may be necessary for young men. Patients with <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> 2 disease must be treated with radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy or hormone therapy case by case.

40|$|We {{report on}} time-resolved {{photometry}} of the 2015 February-March superoutburst of QZ Virginis. The superoutburst {{consisted of a}} separated precursor, main superoutburst, and rebrightening. We detected superhumps with a period of 0. 061181 (42) d between the precursor and main superoutburst. Based on analyses of period changes and amplitudes of superhumps, the observed superhumps were identified as growing superhumps (<b>stage</b> <b>A</b> superhumps). The duration of <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> superhumps was about 5 d, unusually long for SU UMa-type dwarf novae. Using the obtained <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> superhump period, we estimated the mass ratio of QZ Vir to be 0. 108 (3). This value suggests that QZ Vir is an SU UMa-type dwarf nova evolving toward the period minimum. Based on {{the present and the}} previous observations regarding long-lasting <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> superhumps, a time scale of <b>stage</b> <b>A</b> superhumps is likely to be determined by the mass ratio of the system and the temperature of the accretion disk.
