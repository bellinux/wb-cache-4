50|$|This scheme {{does not}} allow the {{addition}} of a stuffed bit as soon as it is required because the stuffable bit is in a fixed point in the frame so it is necessary to wait until the stuffable bit time slot. This wait results in “waiting time jitter” which can be arbitrarily low in frequency (i.e. down to zero) so cannot be entirely eliminated by the filtering effects of the phase lock loop. The worst possible <b>stuffing</b> <b>ratio</b> would be 1 frame in 2 as this gives a theoretical 0.5 bit of jitter so the <b>stuffing</b> <b>ratio</b> is carefully chosen to give theoretical minimum jitter. In a practical system however, the actual decision to stuff or not may be made by comparing the read address and write address of the input buffer store so the position in the frame when the decision is made varies and adds a second variable dependent on the length of the store.|$|E
40|$|Resumo: Para {{investigar}} a qualidade microbiológica e química de alimentos elaborados com carnes moídas, 70 amostras de 12 marcas diferentes foram coletadas em estabelecimentos varejistas do Município de Campinas, S. P.; Brasil. Deste total, 4 produtos eram refrigeradas ou frescos: pasteis, raviolis, "capelettis" e croquetes, e 3 produtos congelados: almôndegas, quibes e hambúrgueres. No caso das massas, com exceção dos croquetes, as análises foram efetuadas ape nas no recheio. Os seguintes microrganismos foram pesquisados: aeróbios viáveis a 359 e a 79 °C, coliformes fecais e Escherichia coli, entero cocos, estafilococos coagulase-positivos, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella sp., fungos, leveduras e microrganis mos lipolíticos. Entre os microrganismos estudados, estafilococos coagu lase-positivos foram isolados de 70 % das amostras de croquetes, Bacillus cereus de 90 % das amostras de almôndegas, Escherichia coli de 50 % das amostras de quibes e Salmonella sp. e Clostridium perfringens de 40 % das amostras de quibes. As amostras de quibe foram as que apresentaram maior frequência de microrganismos de possível risco a saúde do consumi dor. Os recheios de pasteis, "capelettis" e raviolis apresentaram as mais baixas ontagens de microrganismos potencialmente pato gênicos e de outros microrganismos, provavelmente, por serem pre-co sidos. Resultados obtidos das análises de composição em proteí na, lipídios e teor de umidade, e a relação massa:recheio foram mui to variados, nos levando a acreditar na necessidade de padronização de produtos deste tipo. Abstract: In {{order to}} investigate the microbiological and chemical quality of foods elaborated with grounds beef, 70 samples covering 12 different brands were collected from retail markets C meat shops, supermarkets, groceries and pastry shops) {{in the country of}} Campinas, State of São Paulo; Brazil. Of these, 4 products were bougth refrigerated or fresh: pies, raviolis, "capelettis", croquettes, and 3 were frozen products : meat balls, "keebe" and hamburgers. Of the pasta, products, except for croquettes, we analised only the stuffing. The following microorganisms were investigated: viable aerobes at 35 °& and 79 C, fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli,enterococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella sp.,molds, yeasts and lipolytic microorganisms. Of the several groups of microorganisms studied, the coagulase-positive staphylococci were isolated from 701 of the croquette samples; Bacillus cereus from 901 of the eat ball samples; Escherichia coli from 50 % of the "keebe" samples, and Salmonella sp. and Clostridium perfringens from 4 0 % of the "keebe" samples. The "keebe" samples were the most frequently contaminad with potencially pathogenic microorganisms. The minced meat stuffing of the pies, ravioli and "capelettis", showed the lowest counts of potencially pathogenic microorganisms, fecal contaminantes and total aerobic plate count, probably due to the fact they are pre-cooked. Proximate composition, and dough: <b>stuffing</b> <b>ratio</b> showed great variations. which indicates the need for standards for those foods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Using adipic acid, {{ethylene}} glycol and di{{ethylene glycol}} {{as the main}} raw material, the polyester diol was prepared by vacuum melting method. The effects of the dosage of catalyst, the <b>stuff</b> molar <b>ratio</b> of diol and diacid, reaction temperature of the esterification reaction and other factors on the synthesis process of polyester diol were investigated. The optimal conditions of the polyester diol synthesis by vacuum melting method were determined as follows: the <b>stuff</b> molar <b>ratio</b> of diol and diacid 1. 10 : 1, the dosage of catalyst 0. 20 ‰ (the mass fraction of total amount of dicarboxylic acid and diols), the esterification reaction temperature 230 oC. Under such conditions, the esterification reaction time is 5. 5 h to get qualified polyester polyol. Additionally, the structure characteristics of polyester glycol were studied by infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) ...|$|R

Mean pH of the gastric content was 3. 77 ± 0. 69. Mean total capacity (TC) of each stomach was 1702 ± 680 g. Mean <b>Stuff</b> <b>ratio</b> (CW/TC) between the content weight (CW) and stomachs TC was 0. 45. Food categories found in animal stomachs were: 19 categories of vegetal species (Allium spp., Arbutus unedo, Arisarum vulgare, Avena fatua, Avena sativa, Castanea sativa, Ceratonia siliqua, Chamaerops umilis, Cichorium intybus, Hordeum sativum, Juniperus oxycedrus, Myrtus communis, Olea europea, Pirus amygdaliformis, Pistacia lentiscus, Quercus spp., Rhamnus alaternus, Triticum durum, Zea mais); 11 categories of animal species (Agriotes lineatus, Apodemus sylvaticus dicrurus, Chalcides chalcides, Chalcides ocellatus tiligugu, Crematogaster scutellaris, Forficula auricularia, Helix aspersa, Lumbricus terrestris, Ovis aries, Podarcis tiliguerta tiliguerta, Scolopendra cingulata); three categories {{were identified in}} general terms (insects larvae, hairs of mammals, feathers of birds). Food categories found in the stomach contents of Sus scrofa meridionalis confirm observations by other researchers who report the prevalence of vegetables in spite of animal food sorts in the wild boar diet in Italian regions...|$|R
