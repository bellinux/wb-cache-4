5|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>is</b> {{gathered}} from natural forest and plantations, most collectors being {{descendants of the}} original settlers. <b>Seed</b> <b>is</b> then germinated in soil-less media and sealed from the atmosphere to prevent contamination. After testing they are picked, washed (bare-rooted), sanitised and certified then packed and sealed into insulated containers for export. They grow both indoors and out and are popular for hotels and motels worldwide. Nursery profits are returned to enhance the island ecosystem. The nursery plans to expand the business to include the curly palm and other native plants of special interest.|$|E
5|$|Coconut (Cocos nucifera), used {{worldwide}} as a food. The fleshy {{part of the}} <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> edible, {{and used}} either desiccated or fresh as an ingredient in many foods. The pressed oil from the coconut is used in cooking as well.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{are readily}} {{propagated}} from seed. As <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> surrounded by irritating hairs within the pod, extraction requires care. Stem cuttings of semi-mature growth {{can be taken}} in late summer and require the application of rooting hormones and bottom heat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Seeds</b> <b>are</b> {{collected}} from the dry pods/capsules, when the <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> ripe.|$|R
30|$|Twenty-five <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> cracked with a vice, and {{the initial}} weight of each <b>seed</b> <b>was</b> measured. The weights of 25 uncracked <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> also determined. Both sets of <b>seed</b> <b>were</b> then placed on Petri dishes (90 [*]mm[*]×[*] 20 [*]mm) lined with moist cotton and kept covered under {{identical}} laboratory conditions. Each <b>seed</b> <b>was</b> reweighed after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30 and 40 [*]h, and the percentage change in mass was averaged from the 25 seeds from each set.|$|R
50|$|For {{commercial}} purposes, sunflower <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> usually {{classified by}} the pattern on their husks. If the husk is solid black, the <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> called black oil sunflower seeds. The crops may {{be referred to}} as oilseed sunflower crops. These <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> usually pressed to extract their oil. Striped sunflower <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> primarily used for food; as a result, they may be called confectionery sunflower seeds.|$|R
5|$|Seed {{germination}} {{rates are}} quite high. One study found germination rates better than 77% in most batches tested. <b>Seed</b> <b>is</b> {{likely to remain}} viable for a long time, as seed of the closely related B.cuneata remains viable for around ten years.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} partly self-compatible, as some <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> set when pollinators are excluded. Selection against self-pollinated seed has been observed, but the species has {{nonetheless}} {{been shown to}} have one of the lowest outcrossing rates of any Banksia. This is probably caused by the small population sizes, which increase the probability of self-fertilisation, and may discourage visits by pollinators.|$|E
5|$|Banksia cuneata lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, this species is {{strongly}} serotinous: <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an aerial seed bank in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a resin that seals the follicles shut, preventing dehiscence; {{the heat of a}} bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and seed separator, but after cooler fires the seed separator often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed separator are hygroscopic; they draw together when moistened, then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> released only after rain has fallen. The juvenile period for B.cuneata is around four years. Populations are very vulnerable to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population {{and there will be no}} seed from which it might recover. A model-based investigation found that the optimal fire interval for maximising population size over the medium term is around 15 years. More frequent fires reduce population size by killing adults before they have reached their full fecundity. Less frequent fires reduce population size because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination. However, the optimal fire interval for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> {{widely used}} for jewellery. The <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> also {{used as the}} mobile {{elements}} of the kayamb, a musical instrument from Réunion, {{as well as the}} hosho, a gourd rattle from Zimbabwe, where the <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> known as [...] "hota" [...] seeds.|$|R
5|$|Banksia ericifolia {{depends on}} fire for regeneration; if fires are too infrequent, populations age and {{eventually}} die out. However, too-frequent fires also threaten this species, which takes around {{six years to}} reach maturity and flower. One study estimated an optimum fire interval of 15–30years. For {{a large part of}} its distribution Banksia ericifolia grows near areas of human habitation on Australia's eastern coastline. Bushland near urban areas is subject to both arson and prescribed burns, drastically reducing fire intervals and resulting in the disappearance of the species from some areas. The hotter a fire the more quickly <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> released; timing of rains afterwards is also critical for seedling survival.|$|E
5|$|No <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> set when pollinators are excluded, {{indicating}} that seed set must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles mature, and about 82% of seeds mature. These {{are very high}} numbers for Banksia, {{indicating that}} there are no problems with nutrient supply. This species produces an unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant—typically more than 500. However, there are an unusually low number of follicles per cone—often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a Banksia species.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{degree of}} serotiny and fire {{mortality}} in B.prionotes varies with latitude, or, more likely, climate. Observations {{suggest that it}} is always killed by fire in the north of its range, which is relatively hot and dry, and where individual plants are usually smaller, but may survive fire in the cooler, moister, south. Moreover, it is essentially non-serotinous in the south, since all <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> released {{by the end of the}} second year, but seed retention increases steadily to the north, and at the northern end of its range, it typically takes around four years for a plant to release half of its seed in the absence of bushfire, with some seed retained for up to 12 years.|$|E

50|$|Two {{types of}} dried lotus <b>seeds</b> can <b>be</b> found commercially; brown peel and white. The former is {{harvested}} when the seed {{head of the}} lotus is ripe or nearly ripe and the latter is harvested when the <b>seed</b> head <b>is</b> still fully green but with almost fully developed seeds. White lotus <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> de-shelled and de-membraned. At harvest, the bitter-tasting germ of most <b>seeds</b> <b>is</b> removed using a hollow needle. Brown peel lotus <b>seeds</b> <b>are</b> gross brown because the ripened seed has adhered to its membrane. The germ of these hard <b>seeds</b> <b>is</b> removed by cracking the seeds in half.|$|R

5|$|The {{fruit of}} Aiphanes species {{is usually a}} red, spherical, single-seeded drupe. A thin skin (or epicarp), which can be either smooth or spiny, covers the fleshy mesocarp, which is {{typically}} orange and sweet. The mesocarp of A.horrida {{has one of the}} highest reported carotene contents of any plant product and is also rich in protein. The endocarp, which encases the <b>seed,</b> <b>is</b> brown or black and very hard at maturity. Seeds are light brown with a thin seed coat (or testa) and white endosperm, which is sweet and tastes somewhat like coconut.|$|E
5|$|The {{prominent}} flower spikes are {{visited by}} many birds and insects. Honeyeaters are common visitors, particularly the New Holland honeyeater, {{as well as}} the fuscous honeyeater, western wattlebird and western spinebill. Other birds recorded foraging include the grey butcherbird and species of thornbill. Insects recorded include ants, bees, wasps, butterflies, moths, flies and beetles. The short-billed black cockatoo breaks off old cones with follicles to eat the seed, often doing so before the <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> ripe.|$|E
5|$|This group {{contains}} {{shallots and}} potato onions, {{also referred to}} as multiplier onions. The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.|$|E

30|$|The {{seeds of}} the three {{transgenic}} rice lines were harvested in an environmentally isolated paddy field that had Andosol soils at Tohoku University, Japan, in 2005. The <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> sown on nursery beds for the experiment. The <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> size-selected by soaking in NaCl solution. The specific gravity of the NaCl solution was 1.13  g/cm 3 for the selection of NT, gNAS 1, and gNAS 1 [*]+[*]gNAAT <b>seeds.</b> Because there <b>were</b> not enough <b>seeds</b> from the gIDS 3 line, gIDS 3 <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> selected using 1.06  g/cm 3 NaCl solution. After size selection, the <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> soaked overnight in fungicide solution (Momi-guard, Hokuko, Japan) and then soaked in water at 20 °C for 6  days to break dormancy. The <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> then incubated in water at 30 °C overnight to accelerate germination. The <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> sown in nursery bed soil by 3 April 2006. Previously germinated <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> sown on brown soil (pH  5.5; Inaho Kumiai Muhiryou Baido, Agricultural Corporation, Japan) in small pots (3  ml) and then covered with the same soil. Three <b>seeds</b> <b>were</b> sown per pot, covered with soil, and grown for 45  days in a greenhouse at the environmentally isolated field.|$|R

5|$|Cucurbita {{have been}} used in various {{cultures}} as folk remedies. Pumpkins {{have been used}} by Native Americans to treat intestinal worms and urinary ailments. This Native American remedy was adopted by American doctors {{in the early nineteenth century}} as an anthelmintic for the expulsion of worms. In southeastern Europe, seeds of C. pepo were used to treat irritable bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia. In Germany, pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> approved for use by the Commission E, which assesses folk and herbal medicine, for irritated bladder conditions and micturition problems of prostatic hyperplasia stages 1 and 2, although the monograph published in 1985 noted a lack of pharmacological studies that could substantiate empirically found clinical activity. The FDA in the United States, on the other hand, banned the sale of all such non-prescription drugs for the treatment of prostate enlargement in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Quintus of Smyrna, in {{a passage}} whose {{atmosphere}} Boitani describes as sad and elegiac, retains what for Boitani {{are the two}} important issues of the ancient story, that Troilus is doomed by Fate and that his failure to continue his line symbolises Troy's fall. In this case, {{there is no doubt}} that Troilus entered battle knowingly, for in the Posthomerica Troilus's armour is one of the funerary gifts after Achilles' own death. Quintus repeatedly emphasises Troilus's youth: he is beardless, virgin of a bride, childlike, beautiful, the most godlike of all Hecuba's children. Yet he was lured by Fate to war when he knew no fear and was struck down by Achilles' spear just as a flower or corn that has borne no <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> killed by the gardener.|$|E
5|$|Roguelike-likes are {{generally}} much shorter games {{intended to be}} winnable within a single gaming session, in contrast to traditional roguelikes that are designed for multiple sessions of gameplay. Associated with their short length, many roguelike-likes feature a metagame, whereby achieving certain goals will unlock features {{such as the ability}} to select a new character {{at the start of the}} game or the addition of new items and monsters in the procedural generation of the game's levels. Several roguelike-likes feature daily challenges, in which a preset random <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> used to generate the game's levels in a deterministic fashion so that each player will have the same encounters; players attempt to complete the game through those levels or otherwise get the highest score through online leaderboards. Roguelike-likes may also allow the player to enter the random seed directly as to be able to rechallenge the same set of levels or share a difficult set of levels with other players.|$|E

5|$|She {{observed}} {{the effects of}} the transposition of Ac and Ds by the changing patterns of coloration in maize kernels over generations of controlled crosses, and described {{the relationship between the two}} loci through intricate microscopic analysis. She concluded that Ac controls the transposition of the Ds from chromosome9, and that the movement of Ds is accompanied by the breakage of the chromosome. When Ds moves, the aleurone-color gene is released from the suppressing effect of the Ds and transformed into the active form, which initiates the pigment synthesis in cells. The transposition of Ds in different cells is random, it may move in some but not others, which causes color mosaicism. The size of the colored spot on the <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> determined by stage of the seed development during dissociation. McClintock also found that the transposition of Ds is determined by the number of Ac copies in the cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} B.sessilis {{have a number}} of adaptations that serve to {{encourage}} outcrossing. Firstly, they are protandrous: a flower's pollen is released around 72 hours before it becomes itself receptive to pollen, by which time around half of its pollen has lost its viability. Secondly, the period of maximum nectar production closely matches the period during which the flower is sexually active, so honeyeaters are enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination. This has proven an effective strategy: almost all pollen is removed within two to three hours of presentation. In addition, honeyeaters tend to move between inflorescences on different plants, rather than between inflorescences on the same plant, at least in high density sites. These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen. When self-fertilisation does occur, whether autogamous or geitonogamous, the resulting <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> almost always aborted, and the species ultimately achieves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100%, at least in high density sites. Limited data for low-density sites, where honeyeaters move from plant to plant less frequently, suggest more of a mixed-mating system.|$|E
5|$|TumbleSeed {{begins in}} a quiet forest village {{disturbed}} by angry creatures creating holes in the ground. A <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> tasked to fulfill a vague prophecy by ascending the mountain, progressing through the forest, jungle, desert, and snow, to save the town. The player controls an ascending, horizontal, and slanted vine to balance a rolling seed past procedurally generated holes and enemy obstacles {{to reach the top}} of a mountain. With a controller, the player uses two analog sticks to raise and lower the two edges of the horizontal vine while managing the momentum of the seed. If the seed falls into a hole or hits an enemy, the player loses a life ("heart") and resumes from an earlier position, but the game ends once the player runs out of hearts. Some punishments are more severe: A seed that fall into a hole will resume from the last flagged checkpoint, but if the seed collides with spikes or loses all hearts, the game ends and the player returns {{to the bottom of the}} mountain to try again.|$|E
