A vibrational spectrum contains information on the chemical structure of the sample being analysed, which can be recorded rapidly.

Methods: Six elite male skaters (age = 23 ± 1. 8 yr, height = 1. 8 ± 0. 1 m, mass = 80. 1 ± 5. 7 kg, midthigh skinfold thickness = 7 ± 2 mm) and four elite female skaters (age = 21 ± 4 yr, height = 1. 6 ± 0. 1 m, mass = 65. 2 ± 4. 3 kg, midthigh skinfold thickness = 10 ± 1 mm) were studied. Subjects completed time trials over three race distances. Blood lactate concentration and O 2 uptake measurements were combined with near-infrared spectroscopy measures of muscle oxygenation (TSI) and blood volume (tHb) in the right and left vastus lateralis. Results: Neither race distance nor gender had a significant effect on the magnitude of maximal muscle desaturation (ΔTSImax). Pattern of local changes in tHb during individual laps was dependent upon subtle differences in skating technique used for the different race distances. Linear regression analysis revealed asymmetry between the right and left leg desaturation in males during the final stages of each race distance, but not in females. At all race distances, local muscle desaturation reached maximal values much more quickly than global V̇O 2 peak. Conclusion: The use of wearable near-infrared <b>spectroscopy</b> <b>devices</b> enabled measurement of muscle oxygenation during competitive race simulation, thus providing unique insight into the effects of velocity and technique changes on local muscle oxygenation.

40|$|Near {{infrared}} (NIR) spectroscopy is {{an established}} non-invasive optical technique for measuring changes in haemoglobin concentration {{occurring in the}} microcirculation in real time. NIR spectroscopy parameters refect change in tissue haemodynamics and oxygenation and can contribute important physiologic insights when used alone or interpreted in parallel with other conventional measurements. The broad use of NIR spectroscopy in research is not matched by clinical applications; reasons include limitations inherent to the technique, using instruments designed for research at the bedside, ambiguity regarding what NIR spectroscopy measures, defciencies of early algorithms, and understandable expectations by clinicians that NIR spectroscopy data are reproducible and specific enough for clinical decision making. Such issues could be addressed by appropriate collaboration where clinicians drive the questions which NIR spectroscopy is to answer, researchers contribute to monitoring methodology, device design and data analysis/algorithms and both groups utilise physiologic knowledge and practical lessons learned from prior NIR spectroscopy studies when interpreting data. NIR spectroscopy applications in urology are recent and offer clear opportunities for clinicians and researchers to collaborate. Urology is a field where current clinical investigations are limited {{in terms of the}} physiologic information they provide and because the principal test used for evaluation of the many people who have problematic lower urinary tract dysfunction is invasive in nature. Hence the rationale for non-invasive transcutaneous optical monitoring of the bladder during voiding as, when the organ contracts, changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin occur which allow haemodynamic variations and alterations in oxygen supply and demand to be inferred. Different patterns of change are evident in healthy and diseased tissue; these patterns refect the effects of physiologic events observed using NIR spectroscopy to study other tissues and provide novel insights into the causation of voiding dysfunction. This review of the evolution of a wireless methodology for bladder studies includes examples of effective clinician researcher collaboration, reveals how miniature NIR <b>spectroscopy</b> <b>devices</b> make monitoring in ambulant subjects straightforward and makes possible studies in special populations such as children and patients with spinal cord injury.

40|$|Quantum Dot Infrared Photodetectors (QDIPs) are {{important}} alternatives to conventional infrared photodetectors with high potential to provide required detector performance, such as higher temperature operation and multispectral response, {{due to the}} 3 -D quantum confinement of electrons, discrete energy levels, and intrinsic response to perpendicular incident light due to selection rules. However, excessive dark current density, which causes QDIPs to underperform theoretical predictions, is a limiting factor {{for the advancement of}} QDIP technologies. The purpose of this dissertation research is to achieve a better understanding of dopant incorporation into the active region of QDIPs, which is directly related to dark current control and spectral response. From this dissertation research, doping related dipole fields are found to be responsible for excessive dark current in QDIPs. InAs/GaAs QDIPs were grown using solid source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with different doping conditions. The QDIPs were optically characterized using photoluminescence and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) <b>spectroscopy.</b> <b>Devices</b> were fabricated using standard cleanroom fabrication procedures. Dark current and capacitance measurements were performed under different temperature to reveal electronic properties of the materials and devices. A novel scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM) technique was used to study the band structure and carrier concentration on the cross section of a quantum dot (QD) heterostructure. In addition, dark current modeling and bandstructure calculations were performed to verify and better understand experimental results. Two widely used QDIP doping methods with different doping concentrations have been studied in this dissertation research, namely direct doping in InAs QD layer, and modulation doping in the GaAs barrier above InAs QD layer. In the SCM experiment, electron redistribution has been observed due to band-bending in the modulation-doping region, while there is no band-bending observed in directly doped samples. A good agreement between the calculated bandstructure and experimental results leads to better understanding of doping in QD structures. The charge filling process in QDs has been observed by an innovative polarization-dependent FT-IR spectroscopy. The red-shift of QD absorbance peaks with increasing electron occupation supports a miniband electronic configuration for high-density QD ensembles. In addition, the FT-IR measurement indicates the existence of donor-complex (DX) defect centers in Si-doped QDIPs. The existence of DX centers and related dipole fields have been confirmed by dark current measurements to extract activation energies and by photocapacitance quenching measurements. With the understanding achieved from experimental results, a further improved dark current model has been developed based on the previous model originally established by Ryzhii and improved by Stiff-Roberts. In the model described in this dissertation, two new factors have been considered. The inclusion of background drift current originating from Si shallow donors in the low bias region results in excellent agreement between calculated and measured dark currents at different temperatures, which has not been achieved by previous models. A very significant effect has been observed in that dark current leakage occurs due to the dipole field caused by doping induced charge distribution and impact-ionized DX centers. Last but not least, QDIPs featuring the dipole interface doping (DID) method have been designed to reduce the dark current density without changing the activation energy (thus detection wavelength) of QDIPs. The DID samples involve an InAs QD layer directly-doped by Si, as well as Be doping in the GaAs barrier {{on both sides of the}} QD layer. The experimental result shows the dark current density has been significantly reduced by 104 times without any significant change to the corresponding activation energy. However, the high p-type doping in the GaAs barrier poses a challenge in that the Fermi level is reduced to be well below the QD energy states. High p-type doping is reported to reduce the dark current, photocurrent and the responsivity of the devices. To conclude, it is significant to identify to effect of Si-induced defect centers on QDIP dark currents. The subsequent study reveals doping induced dipole fields can have significant effects on QDIP device performance, for example, causing charge leakage from QDs and reducing activation energy, thereby increasing dark current density. The DID approach developed in this work is a promising approach that could help address these issues by using controlled dipole fields to reduce dark current density without changing the minimum detectable energy of QDIPs.

Son yıllarda gıda kalitesinin belirlenmesinde  UV, Vis ve NIR Spektroskopisi kullanışlı, etkili ve hızlı bir teknik olarak önem  kazanmıştır. Kemometrik ve bilişim teknolojisinin de ilerlemesiyle NIR  spektroskopisinin kullanımı gıda kalitesi araştırmacıları tarafından sıklıkla tercih  edilebilir duruma gelmiştir.   UV spektroskopisinde 100 - 390 nm, Vis spektroskopisinde 390 – 700 nm NIR  spektroskopisinde ise 750 – 2500 nm aralığı değerlendirilir ve moleküler yapısal  bilgi sağlayan yansıma (ve ince kesitlerinden geçirgenlik) ölçümleri temel alınır.   UV, Vis ve NIR spektroskopisi cihazı içerisinde birkaç ışık kaynağı ile yine en az 2   ışık detektörünün olduğu ve bu detektörlerden alınan sonuçların izlendiği bir  cihazdır.   Literatür araştırıldığında günlük tüketilen besinler süt, meyve, mısır, yağ, et, balık  yağı, meyve suları, zeytinyağı ve daha birçok gıda ürünlerinde NIR spektroskopisi ile  ölçümler yapıldığı görülmüştür. Bu çalışmaların incelenmesi ile birlikte yapılan ön  çalışmalar sonucunda belirli dalga boylarında meyve dokusu ile ışık arasında  etkileşim izlenmiş ve yansıma bantları görülmüştür. Genel olarak UV/Vis/NIR  elektromagnetik dalgalar doku ile etkileşime girdiğinde, dokunun optik özelliklerine  göre soğurulabilir, saçılabilir yada etkileşime girmeden dokudan geçebilir. Bu  yüzden dokunun hücresel bileşenleri her bileşenin kendine özgü yapısından dolayı  farklı dalga boylarıyla farklı biçimde etkileşir.

In food industry, {{reliability}} {{and quality of}} food is an important subject manner since  it relates directly to the human health. In recent years, UV (Ultraviolet), Vis (Visible)   and NIR (Near Infrared) spectroscopy have become popular since these are useful,  effective and fast techniques. Spectroscopic measurements are preferred frequently  since these measurements neither damage nor change the tissue on which they are  applied. Due to advances in chemometric and informatics technology, the use of  spectroscopy by food quality researchers have become very popular.   By performing spectroscopic measurements in a wider range, one can obtain more  information in a wider spectrum interval. The following intervals are considered in  UV, Vis and NIR spectroscopy, respectively: 100 - 390 nm, 390 - 700 nm and 750 - 2500 nm, and reflection measurements are considered to obtain information on  molecular structure. There are two light sources {{as well as two}} light detectors in UV,  Vis and NIR <b>spectroscopy</b> <b>devices</b> and in <b>spectroscopy</b> <b>devices</b> the results obtained  from these two detectors are monitored.   In this study, measurements were performed in 280 - 2500 nm interval. This 280 - 2500   nm intervals occupies UV/Vis/NIR regions. Two light sources were exploited in the  aforementioned device, while for the spectrum interval corresponding to NIR and  Vis regions an halogen lamb was used. On the other hand, for the spectrum interval  corresponding to the UV region, a spectrophotometer having a doterium lamb was  used. Integrating sphere reflection measurements assures that results are obtained  accurately and reliablely {{from all parts of the}} tissue and from all angles. Calibration  of the device was repeatly performed every time it was turned on and the lambs were  replaced every six months. The data obtained after measurements was transferred to  a computer. In order to evaluate the gathered data, Powerful UV Winlab software  was used in the processing computers.   In literature, researchers performed measurements using spectroscopic methods on  daily consumed foods such as milk, fruit, corn, oil, meat, fish oil, fruit juice, olive oil and so on. By the review of the current works in the literature, we observed through  first studies that there is an interaction between the fruit tissue and light at certain  wavelengths and reflections bands were observed. Generally, when fruit tissues are  exposed to UV/Vis/NIR electromagnetic waves, these waves can be absorbed,  scatterred or penetrate through the tissue without interaction according to the optical  properties of the tissue. Therefore, the cell structure of the tissue interact with  different wavelenghts in a different ways due to the the distinctive structure of the  tissue's cell structure. In other words, the cell structure determines optical properties  and can be distinctive.   The following three features were investigated to determine the fruit ripening  1) The pigments at the pericarp of the fruit  2) The cell structure of the fruit  3) The water content of the fruit  In this study, using reflection measurements at six different wavelengths, the data  obtained at different ripening stages were processed and investigated. These six  different wavelengths were determined with measurements and in reflection  measurements, electromagnetic sources of 10 mW power were considered.   Reflection bands formed by the tissue were investigated in detail in three parts: color  region of the tissue, the region contains the tissue pigments and the water region  inside the tissue. During experiments, according to the studies performed at color  pigment regions, we observed that different fruits show absorption percentage peak  values at different wavelenghts in the provided figures. First, these peak values  correspond to the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Second, the  observed region is the region of tissue pigments and cell structure. In spite of the fact  that different fruits show different absorption percentage peak values, we also  observed that the fruits of the same kind can show different peak values at different  times or when they were kept for some time. Finally, it is observed that the water  absorption bands of the fruit tissue were more intense at specific wavelengths of the  absorption band (such as 980 nm, 1250 nm, 1480 nm ve 1950 nm); however, it is  seen that the depth of the concavities at the graphics of this region varies according  to the maturity of the fruit tissue. We observed that with the increasing maturity of  the fruit tissue, the mentioned concavities at the graphics become more apparent.   According to the collected results, there is an interaction at specific wavelengths for  the pigment structure of the fruit, fleshy fruit and juicy fruit. We observed that  interaction wavelengths were specific values, which were close to each other for  different fruits. Considering this fact, the wavelength of the light sources were  determined by the calculation of the average wavelength that can be used for each  fruit. Contrary to the studies given in literature, water content and color changes of the fleshy part of ten different types of fruits (apple-granny smith, apple-starking, apple-golden, plum, pear, apricot, peach, kiwifruit, pomegranate, strawberry and quince) are investigated in this study. Additionally, absorption percentance differences which were obtained from gritty and non-gritty surfaces of the pericarp of different fruits and color and water content changes according to the inner or oute layers of the fruit pericarp were analyzed. Moreover, the measurement value differences in the peak values show the inner cell structure after purification of the fluffies as well as the percentange differences in the absorption band of the water content of the inner cell structure of the two different types of fruits at the same color were investigated.   As using the results of this work a original handheld device was developed by my fellow graduate student friend Ali SARIKAŞ to analyze several harvesting time, the maturity of the inner structure and the water content of the fruits. Measurement results can be monitored over the LCD display which is installed on the developed hand-held device and the corresponding results can be obtained as percentage. Specific percentage intervals can be displayed shown on the display for three different states of the fruit. By considering the results of the measurements, it becomes possible to determine the maturity state of the fruit (immature, half-mature, mature) as well as the suitable harvesting time of the fruit according to its maturity. In such a device only using UV and NIR light sources degree of aging of human skin, wound / burn healing, can be measured. Also available for this device with the optical fiber probe design more precise measurements can be made from the tissue surface. Using specific wavelengths and powerful light sources can also be more thick-skinned fruits maturity analysis. By changing the light source mentioned in the introduction of the thesis can be made from fruits other qualitative measures. This device provides a record of the reference number of the desired flexible software architecture can be measured by the thousands of species of fruit (~ 150, 000 fruit type) allows. Measuring period (~ 5 seconds) is too short a period of time in resolution consequently faster measurement provides more instances. Analysis of the material to the thin film coating of composite materials, as well as to improve the strength properties of the compounds employed in the qualitative analysis of the optical properties may also be undertaken.

The aims of this pilot study were {{to determine the}} feasibility of incorporating a reflectance <b>spectroscopy</b> <b>device</b> into the EUS-FNA clinical procedure and to gather preliminary information about the vascular physiology within the center of normal and metastatic lymph nodes. MethodsThis study included 10 patients with proven or suspected lung cancer and an indication for EUS-FNA.

An impedance <b>spectroscopy</b> <b>device</b> was designed and tested with the hopes of assisting in vitro fertilization by quantifying electrical properties of embryos to differentiate viable and non-viable samples. Finally, liquid metal technology for use in reconfigurable RF devices was furthered by determining the conductivity of the liquid metal Galinstan in the RF range, which allows for better predictability in the performance of future Galinstan reconfigurable RF devices...|$|R
40|$|The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) {{is a hard}} X-ray imaging <b>spectroscopy</b> <b>device</b> to {{be mounted}} in the Solar Orbiter cluster {{with the aim of}} {{providing}} images and spectra of solar flaring regions at different photon energies in the range from a few keV to around 150 keV. The imaging modality of this telescope is based on the Moire pattern concept and utilizes 30 sub-collimators, each one containing a pair of co-axial grids. This paper applies Fourier analysis to provide the first rigorous description of the data formation process in STIX. Specifically, we show that, under first harmonic approximation, the integrated counts measured by STIX sub-collimators can be interpreted as specific spatial Fourier components of the incoming photon flux, named visibilities. Fourier analysis also allows the quantitative assessment of the reliability of such interpretation. The description of STIX data in terms of visibilities has a notable impact on the image reconstruction process, since it fosters the application of Fourier-based imaging algorithms.

We demonstrate the potential {{and reliability of}} the method on time scales from milliseconds to minutes by investigating the coupled folding and binding reaction of two intrinsically disordered proteins and the conformational changes occurring in a large cytolytic pore-forming toxin...|$|R
40|$|A sensitive, labor-saving, {{and easily}} automatable nonradioactive {{procedure}} named APEX-FCS (amplified probe extension detected by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy) {{has been established}} to detect specific in vitro amplification of pathogen genomic sequences. As an example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification with the Stoffel fragment of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase {{in the presence of}} nanomolar concentrations of a rhodamine-labeled probe (third primer), binding to the target in between the micromolar amplification primers. The probe becomes extended only when specific amplification occurs. Its low concentration avoids false-positives due to unspecific hybridization under PCR conditions. With increasing portion of extended probe molecules, the probe’s average translational diffusion properties gradually change {{over the course of the}} reaction, reflecting amplification kinetics. Following PCR, this change from a stage of high to a stage of low mobility can directly be monitored during a 30 -s measurement using a fluorescence correlation <b>spectroscopy</b> <b>device.</b> Quantitation down to 10 target molecules in a background of 2. 5 μg unspecific DNA without post-PCR probe manipulations could be achieved with different primer/probe combinations. The assay holds the promise to concurrently perform amplification, probe hybridization, and specific detection without opening the reaction chamber, if sealable foils are used...|$|R
40|$|Emotional {{working memory}} (EWM) is {{suggested}} {{as a working}} memory (WM) type, distinguished to process emotional stimuli, and {{may or may not}} be spared in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim was to compare patients with AD and healthy older adults (HC) on verbal EWM performance and accompanying prefrontal cortex activity. Twenty AD patients along with 20 HC individuals are required to complete an emotional one-back task in three conditions (neutral, positive and negative word lists). Prefrontal oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) concentrations were measured simultaneously by a 24 - channel functional near infrared <b>spectroscopy</b> <b>device.</b> Correct response rates were similar in two groups in all conditions. Reaction times were comparable in the EWM positive condition but longer in the AD group in EWMneutral and negative conditions. In the HC group, emotional words had no significant effect on WM. On the other hand, positive compared to neutral words led to greater activation in the left ventral prefrontal cortex (VPFC) in AD group. When compared to HCs, activity in the VPFC was significantly higher in AD patients during the positive condition. Positive words facilitated WM performance in participants with AD. Activity in VPFC may be the functional correlate of this phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The {{techniques}} of hydrogen loading in Pd are developed by many workers. And {{the states of}} hydrogen in Pd attract many interests because they {{might be related to}} the nuclear reactions. In this study, we have tried to observe optical phonon induced by hydrogen-hydrogen interactions in Pd using Raman spectroscopy. This measurement can be done for the sample completely sealed in a glass tube cutting off the influence of the external air, because glass materials are Raman inactive. In the measurement chamber of <b>spectroscopy</b> <b>device,</b> scattered waves of the incident laser beam from the hydrogen storage Pd are detected and Raman shifts including the information about the optical phonon in the sample are derived. If the large changes in Raman spectra are found, they will help explain the nuclear effects in condensed states of palladium hydride. So far, we have not found large changes, but the peaks of Raman shift at 56 meV both for PdHx and PdDx are detected. The peaks for PdHx are consistent with the data of Sherman et al. at 58. 5 meV. However, the peaks for PdDx are inconsistent with Sharman’s result at 39. 7 meV. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{combination}} of impedance <b>spectroscopy,</b> <b>device</b> characterization, and modeling {{is used to}} pinpoint key processes {{in the operation of}} polymer light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). At low applied voltage, electric double layers with a thickness of ≈ 2 – 3 nm are shown to exist at the electrode interfaces. At voltages exceeding the bandgap potential of the conjugated polymer (V ≥ 2. 5 V for superyellow), a light-emitting p–n junction forms in situ, with a steady-state structure that is found to depend strongly on the applied voltage. This is exemplified by that the effective p–n junction thickness (dpn) for a device with an interelectrode gap of 90 nm decreases from ≈ 23 nm at 2. 5 V to ≈ 6 nm at 3. 9 V. The current increases with decreasing dpn in a concerted manner, while the brightness reaches its peak at V = 3. 4 V when dpn ≈ 10 nm. The existence of an optimum dpn for high brightness in LECs is attributed to an offset between an increase in the exciton formation rate with decreasing dpn, due to an increasing current, and a simultaneous decrease in the exciton radiative decay rate, when an increasing fraction of excitons diffuses away from the p–n junction into the surrounding non-radiative doping regions...|$|R
40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to The University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Medicine. There are several, predictable complications of prematurity that are faced by premature infants. Patent ductus arteriosus is among them. This study is an evaluation of a near infrared <b>spectroscopy</b> <b>device</b> {{to see if the}} premature infants can be monitored in order to detect significant ductal steal secondary to symptomatic PDA. We hypothesize that in these cases, there would be a difference between renal and cerebral regional oxygenation. To evaluate a difference, it is essential to first establish baseline regional oxygenation values, which are scarce in current literature. There are many pathophysiologic states experienced by premature infants, such as hypoxic spells and intraventricular hemorrhage, which may affect the data. Therefore, the effects of abnormal brain activity on cerebral monitoring are also evaluated. Our preliminary data shows a mean cerebral reading of 77. 5189 and a mean renal reading of 70. 9105, both without any linear trends. Now that normative data for regional oxygen saturation in the preterm neonate has been established, this opens up a pathway for the study of additional states, such as the left to right shunt of sPDA, since there is now a standard for comparison...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} “mesogranulation ” {{phenomenon}} by analyzing a spectral time series, taken at disk {{center with a}} two-dimensional <b>spectroscopy</b> <b>device</b> and covering a period of 4 hours. This tunable device was composed by a Fabry-Perot interferometer mounted in tandem with an Universal Birefringent Filter (UBF). We calculate spatial power spectra, spatiotemporal k − ω power, phase difference and coherence spectra at different low photospheric levels, in order to investigate {{the nature of the}} mesoscale phenomena. At the lowest levels, mesostructures appear as a part of an extended distribution of granular sizes without further distinction from granulation. Here, the plasma flows are driven by convection. On the other hand, a different mesoscale phenomenon emerges at levels as high as approximately 200 - 300 km above τ 5000 = 1, at medium spatial (k ≈ 0. 5 [...] . 2 Mm − 1) and medium temporal (ν ≈ 0. 5 [...] . 1 mHz) frequencies. This phenomenon is distinct from convection by its non-convective phase difference values (Φv−I ≈− 30 ◦, Φv−v < 0 ◦) and by its different propagation character (almost horizontal propagation). By these properties, the mesoscale phenomena in the higher photosphere can be identified as internal gravity waves in the solar atmosphere. Key words: Sun: atmosphere, granulation, photosphere, oscillations – convection – hydrodynamic...|$|R
