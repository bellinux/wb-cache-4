5|$|The Albert Bridge is a {{road bridge}} over the River Thames in West London, {{connecting}} Chelsea on the north bank to Battersea on the south bank. Designed and built by Rowland Mason Ordish in 1873 as an Ordish–Lefeuvre system modified cable-stayed bridge, {{it proved to be}} structurally unsound, so between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated some of the design elements of a suspension bridge. In 1973 the Greater London Council added two concrete piers, which transformed the central span into a <b>simple</b> <b>beam</b> bridge. As a result, today the bridge is an unusual hybrid of three different design styles. It is an English Heritage Grade II* listed building.|$|E
25|$|For space reasons, Oldsmobile adopted torsion {{bars for}} the Toronado's front {{suspension}} (the first GM passenger car application of torsion bars in the US, but {{still did not}} duplicate Packard's automatic ride leveling system. On a side note, European Opel and Vauxhall divisions used torsion bars in the 1930s and 1940s), with conventional, unequal-length double wishbones. Rear Toronado suspension was a <b>simple</b> <b>beam</b> axle on single leaf springs, unusual only in having dual shock absorbers, one vertical, one horizontal (allowing it {{to act as a}} radius rod to control wheel movement).|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the {{interior}} of the palace is based on its original function. The ground floor was occupied by officials of the episcopal court, guards and servants. The main entrance through the arcade loggia lead to the vast hall (now divided), from where the vaulted corridors lead to the side courtyards. The left side of the palace was occupied by podskarbi (treasurer), treasury, lockers and storage facilities, while the right was reserved for the marshal and starosta (mayor). The chambers were covered with a <b>simple</b> <b>beam</b> ceilings, part of the treasury was vaulted. The vaults in the loggias and in the north-west alcove were adorned with stucco decorations.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{several other}} glider {{designers}} {{of the early}} 1930s, Lajos Rotter was impressed by Alexander Lippisch's Wien of 1929 and his high performance, single seat Karakán bears its influence. Like the Wien, the Karakán was a high aspect ratio sailplane with a two-piece high wing with a rectangular plan centre section and long, straight tapered outer panels. Both had thick section wings at the root which became progressively thinner over the outer panels. [...] On both designs, ailerons occupied the whole trailing edge of these outer panels. Structurally, the wings were similar, with two spars of unequal strength; the forward spar beams were part of plywood covered D-boxes around the leading edges and the rear spar was a lighter <b>simple</b> <b>beam.</b> The wings were fabric covered behind the main spar, as were the ailerons. Both designs had, on each side, an airfoil-faired V-form strut from the lower fuselage to the outer ends of the centre section, the forward member of the V, connected to the main spar, was more substantial than the rear.|$|E
40|$|This study aims at {{obtaining the}} cost of Prestressed Concrete (PC) beams and Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams. These beams are {{designed}} {{according to the requirements}} of the ACI 318 - 05 code. The objective function comprised {{the cost of}} concrete and the cost of reinforcement. Two computer models were developed for the cost optimization of PC and RC <b>simple</b> <b>beams</b> using MATLAB software. The design variables of RC <b>simple</b> <b>beams</b> were beam width, effective beam depth, number of flexural bars and reinforcement bar diameter. Beam width, effective beam depth, number of flexural bars, reinforcement bar diameter, number of tendons, tendon diameter and eccentricity of the centre of gravity of the tendons represented the design variables of PC <b>simple</b> <b>beams.</b> Practical design situations were considered using integer values for beam dimensions, number and diameter of bars/tendons. A catalogue of the common values of the beam dimensions and bar/tendon numbers and diameter dimensions were prepared for this purpose. A cost reduction of 27. 9 and 16. 7 % for the 4 and 8 m span RC beams, respectively and 29. 8 and 17. 8 % of the 10 and 20 m span PC beams was obtained by the GA model over the generalized reduced gradient method. The effect of concrete compressive strengths and wider design parameters bounds on the outputs of the optimization process were examined. The comparison showed that the GA models were smart in keep moving towards the optimum cost of the beams...|$|R
40|$|Thermoelastic {{dissipation}} (TED) is {{analyzed for}} complex geometries of micromechanical resonators, demonstrating {{the impact of}} resonator design (i. e. slots machined into flexural beams) on TED-limited quality factor. Clarence Zener first described TED for <b>simple</b> <b>beams</b> in 1937. This work extends beyond <b>simple</b> <b>beams</b> into arbitrary geometries, verifying simulations that completely capture the coupled physics that occur. Novel geometries of slots engineered at specific locations within the flexural resonator beams are utilized. These slots drastically affect the thermal-mechanical coupling and {{have an impact on}} the quality factor, providing resonators with quality factors higher than those predicted by simple Zener theory. The ideal location for maximum impact of slots is determined to be in regions of high strain. We have demonstrated the ability to predict and control the quality factor of micromechanical resonators limited by thermoelastic dissipation. This enables tuning of the quality factor by structure design without the need to scale its size, thus allowing for enhanced design optimization...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{involved the}} fabrication and testing to {{failure of a}} large number of nominally identical reinforced concrete members such as 20 <b>simple</b> <b>beams,</b> 20 two-span continuous beam and 20 columns. The <b>simple</b> <b>beams</b> were of rectangular section 5 " wide by 8 " deep with 2 -# 5 bars as tension reinforcement only. The <b>simple</b> <b>beams</b> were loaded to failure using equal loads at the third points. The two-span continuous beams, also of rectangular section 5 " x 8 " had both tension (2 -# 5 bars) and compression (2 -# 5 bars) reinforcement, equal loads were applied at the centre of each span. The column was rectangular in section (6 " x 6 ") with symetrical reinforcement of 4 -# 5 bars. The column was loaded to failure by an eccentric load. The distribution of load carrying capacity of the members was determined by finding the joint probability of a given concrete strength and steel yield stress occurring and calculating the ultimate load using a prediction formulae. From the comparison of the results, it was found that the experimentally determined mean strength of the beams and columns were in good agreement with the ultimate loads which were calculated from the prediction formulae of the National Building Cade of Canada and the building code requirement of the American Concrete Institute. From the predicted distribution of ultimate load capacity the probability of the ultimate load being less than the design load was determined. Using the &phis; factors recommended by the NBC. The probability of failure for the columns was less than 0. 01 % and 7 % for the beams...|$|R
