5|$|Fruit in {{blackcurrants}} {{is borne}} primarily on one-year-old <b>shoots.</b> Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all <b>shoots</b> back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak <b>shoots</b> and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new <b>shoots.</b> An established bush {{should not be allowed to}} become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E
