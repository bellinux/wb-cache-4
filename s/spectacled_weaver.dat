50|$|Nests of Polybioides tabidus {{are found}} to be {{attractive}} nesting sites for seven species of small birds in Yaoundé, Cameroon—including the <b>spectacled</b> <b>weaver</b> (Ploceus ocularis), and the common fiscal (Lanius collaris). Smaller birds, such as the <b>spectacled</b> <b>weaver,</b> are found in closer proximity to nests than the common fiscal and other larger birds. The difference in distance of association between small and large birds {{is due to the fact}} that larger birds would be more likely to perturb a wasp nest when it lands on a proximal branch.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>spectacled</b> <b>weaver</b> (Ploceus ocularis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Ploceidae. It is found widely in woodland, forest edge and gardens of East, Middle and Southern Africa, but is absent from the most arid regions (such as the Karoo) and dense, primary rainforest. This common species breeds in solitary pairs, and both sexes are bright yellow, have an olive-yellow back, black [...] "spectacles" [...] and pale eyes. The male has a black throat.|$|E
50|$|In {{the blue}} waxbill both sexes build the nest, {{which is an}} oval-shaped {{structure}} with a short entrance tunnel on the side, constructed of grass stems and inflorescences and lined with feathers. The nest is normally placed among the foliage of a bush or tree, especially umbrella thorn and sickle bush Dichrostachys cinerea. They often choose to build the nest near a wasps' nests such as Belonogaster juncea, {{there is no evidence}} that wasps deter nest predators, but the birds may use the presence wasp nests as a way of working out whether there are arboreal ants Psuedomyrmex spp in the tree, as if present they would deter nesting by any wasps or birds. Blue waxbills may also re-use the old nests of other birds, such as scarlet-chested sunbird, <b>spectacled</b> <b>weaver</b> or black-chested prinia, sometimes building a new structure on top of the original.|$|E
40|$|Natal {{is fairly}} similar. The median {{breeding}} {{period of the}} three Ploceus species is in November {{and that of the}} Thick-billed Weaver is in December. The length of the egg-laying season is 3. 7 – 4. 1 months in the three Ploceus species and 4. 4 months in the Thick-billed Weaver. The breeding seasonality is similar in the Eastern Cape and former Transvaal regions, both being summer-rainfall areas, but it is more variable in KwaZulu-Natal. In the three Ploceus species, duration of moult was shortest in Yellow Weavers (66 days), intermediate in Village Weavers (96 days), and longest in <b>Spectacled</b> <b>Weavers</b> (114 days). Primary moult started in February and ended in May for these three species in KwaZulu-Natal. There were enough data for Village Weaver to analyse moult for three separate years, imposing a constant duration on all years. Start date varied significantly by up to two weeks in different years. The Thick-billed Weaver had a similar duration of moult in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal of 71 and 73 days respectively, but the start date was significantly earlier in Gauteng (five weeks earlier) ...|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 2484 birds {{belonging}} to 56 species were recorded at the 12 sampling sites.
