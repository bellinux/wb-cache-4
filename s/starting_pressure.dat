30|$|Because {{the matrix}} of tight gas {{sandstones}} in Xujiahe Formation {{is characterized by}} poor pore structure, small pores, narrow pore throats, and low permeability, the resistance to fluid flow is great, and the interacting forces at the interfaces of solids and liquids are strong. Therefore, a clear <b>start</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient exists and the fluid flow is not coincident with the Darcy law. <b>Start</b> <b>pressure</b> is inversely proportional to matrix permeability (Shanley et al. 2004; Friedel and Voigt 2006). The lower the permeability is, the higher the <b>start</b> <b>pressure</b> is, and the greater the influence on the development.

50|$|In {{the case}} of the {{normally}} aspirated engine, {{at the start of the}} compression stroke the cylinder air / fuel volume is very high, this translates into a low <b>starting</b> <b>pressure.</b> As the piston travels upward, abnormally high cylinder pressures may result in the mixture auto-igniting or detonating, which is why conservative compression ratios are used in consumer vehicles. In a forced induction engine where at the start of the compression stroke the cylinder pressure is already raised (having a greater volume of air/fuel) Exp. 202kPa (29.4Psi) the <b>starting</b> <b>pressure</b> or air / fuel volume would be 2 times that of the normally aspirated engine. This would translate into an effective compression ratio of 20:1 vs. 10:1 for the normally aspirated. This is why many forced induction engines have compression ratios in the 8:1 range.|$|E

50|$|The air-based {{separate}} {{pressure chamber}} or firing chamber system {{works on the}} same physical principle as the pressurized reservoir system, but instead of pressurizing the reservoir, a separate, fixed volume chamber is included on the water gun into which water is pumped, compressing the air inside. This technology was first used on the Super Soaker SS 100. This allows the reservoir to be removed/opened at any time for refilling since the reservoir is not pressurized. As well, the typically smaller size of the pressure chamber {{and the fact that}} water is typically pumped, as opposed to air, reduces the average number of pumps needed to achieve functional pressure. For improved performance, some users opt to pre-pressurize the firing chamber by pumping in some air first. This increases the <b>starting</b> <b>pressure</b> within the chamber, thus increasing the overall average pressure experienced by the water when it is pumped into the pressure chamber.|$|E
50|$|Mathematical {{analyses}} {{have shown}} that two types of losses must be overcome for generation of oscillations to start. Losses of the first type {{are associated with the}} dispersion of energy inside the active medium and second type losses are due to radiation losses at the ends of the resonator. These types of losses are inversely proportional to the amount of energy stored in the resonator. In general, the disparity of the radiators does not play a role in any attempt of a mathematical calculation of the starting conditions. Bubbles with resonance frequencies close to the pump frequency make the main contribution to the gain of the useful mode. In contrast, the determination of the <b>starting</b> <b>pressure</b> in ordinary lasers is independent from the number of radiators. The useful mode grows with the number of particles but sound absorption increases at the same time. Both these factors neutralize each other. Bubbles play the main role in the energy dispersion in a SASER.|$|E

This paper mainly used Runge Kutta Fehlberg Method and Adams Fourth-order Predictor-Corrector to solve the black oil model, which was founded to study the process of CO 2 flooding. These two methods considered the <b>starting</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient during the CO 2 flooding, and the influence of reservoir permeability and crude oil density were studied by founding black oil model and use these two methods to solve the model.

5000|$|Since {{the burning}} rate of {{smokeless}} powder varies {{directly with the}} pressure, the initial pressure buildup,(i.e. [...] "the shot-start pressure"), has {{a significant effect on}} the final velocity, especially in large cartridges with very fast powders and relatively light weight projectiles. [...] In small caliber firearms, the friction holding the bullet in the case, determines how soon after ignition the bullet moves, and since the motion of the bullet increases the volume and drops the pressure, a difference in friction can change the slope of the pressure curve. In general, a tight fit is desired, to the extent of crimping the bullet into the case. In straight-walled rimless cases, such as the [...]45 ACP, an aggressive crimp is not possible, since the case is held in the chamber by the mouth of the case, but sizing the case to allow a tight interference fit with the bullet, can give the desired result. In larger caliber firearms, the shot <b>start</b> <b>pressure</b> is often determined by the force required to initially engrave the projectile driving band into the start of the barrel rifling; smoothbore guns, which do not have rifling, achieve shot <b>start</b> <b>pressure</b> by initially driving the projectile into a [...] "forcing cone" [...] that provides resistance as it compresses the projectile obturation ring.|$|R
