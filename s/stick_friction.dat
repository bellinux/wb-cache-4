40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{computational}} modeling and numerical simulation of contact problems at Unite deformations using the Finite element method. Quasi-static and dynamic problems are considered and two particular frictional conditions, full <b>stick</b> <b>friction</b> and frictionless cases, are addressed. Lagrange multipliers and regularized formulations of the contact problem, such as penalty or augmented Lagrangian methods, are avoided and a new direct elimination method is proposed. Conserving algorithms are also introduced for the proposed formulation for dynamic contact problems. An assessment of he performance of the resulting formulation is shown {{in a number of}} selected benchmark tests and numerical examples, including both quasi-static and dynamic contact problems under full <b>stick</b> <b>friction</b> and frictionless contact conditions. Conservation of key discrete properties exhibited by the time stepping algorithm used for dynamic contact problems is also shown in an example. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

It is also shown that the perceived surface stiffness can be increased without loss of stability by applying a braking force pulse when crossing into the wall. For stick-slip friction, Karnopp's model was implemented using a PD controller within the <b>stick</b> <b>friction</b> threshold.

2500|$|Heat {{generation}} during friction-stir welding {{arises from}} two main sources: friction {{at the surface}} of the tool and the deformation of the material around the tool. The heat generation is often assumed to occur predominantly under the shoulder, due to its greater surface area, and to be equal to the power required to overcome the contact forces between the tool and the workpiece. The contact condition under the shoulder can be described by sliding friction, using a friction coefficient μ and interfacial pressure P, or <b>sticking</b> <b>friction,</b> based on the interfacial shear strength at an appropriate temperature and strain rate.

30|$|Figure  6 {{shows an}} optical {{photograph}} of the 30  % PF resin-impregnated wood specimen stuck onto the metal tool surface after the μ measurement at 160  °C. The result indicates that when the specimen was moved by stem, shearing fracture was generated inside the specimen where {{it was not yet}} hardened, because the resistance on the contact surface was sufficiently large to prevent slip between the metal tool and the wood specimen at 160  °C, at which temperature the specimen was cured. It is known that shearing stress at an interface cannot exceed shearing strength of a material [15]. When the shearing stress at the interface becomes equal to the shearing strength of the material, the slippage at the interface is stopped and shearing fracture is generated inside the material (<b>sticking</b> <b>friction).</b> In this case of <b>sticking</b> <b>friction,</b> the friction force is due not to shearing at the interface, but to shearing fracture [16]. It seems that the variation of μ at 160  °C for 30  % PF resin (Fig.  5) is attributed to repeated shearing fracture of the specimens and rubbing on the fractured surfaces.|$|R
40|$|The {{extrusion}} tools can {{be easily}} split along the tool-metal interface {{as in the previous}} paper, and also the bearing chips set in the tools are designed to be exchangeable. The effects of the tool surface on the surface roughness of extrusion products are examined, and the frictional mechanisms are investigated by electron probe microanalysis. (1) By the bearing chips of nitrified tool steel(N) and cemented carbide metal(G_ 2), the contact mechanism along the interface between the toll and the metal is slip friction, and the bearing surface is covered with adhesion of thin films composed mainly of Al and Mg. The products surfa e becomes the finest one. (2) By the three buff-polished bearing chips of SKD 61, and with the carbide layers of CrC and TiC, the contact mechanism is <b>stick</b> <b>friction.</b> The adhesion grows into a band-like shape, and after its peeling off, the products surface becomes rougher than the first result(1). The main components of adhesion are Al and Si, and Fe and Si segregate on the products surface. 現在，アルミニウム合金型材の熱間押出加工において，加工材の表面に発生する欠陥は加工速度，加工温度及ぴ押出比などと密接な関係であることは周知の事実である。ところが，さらに製品の品質と生産能率の向上をはかるには，工具と材料面間の摩擦を小さくし，工具寿命も向上できる工具及びビレット組成についての研究が必要である。前報では熱間焼入工具鋼（SKD 61 ）で作製したダイベアリング面（整形部）の仕上条件と加工材表面あらさとの関係を，押出用分割ダイを用いて直接観察し，表面あらさの生成機構をモデル化した。本報は加工材の表面あらさに及ぼすダイベアリング面の仕上条件の影響と，各種ベアリング面を変えて押出実験を行い，付着状態と加工材の表面あらさとの関係の一般性を求めるとともに，付着に起因するベアリング面とビレット面との接触界面現象に着目してX線マイクロアナライザ（EPMA）を用いて分析し，検出した成分移動の結果が加工材の表面あらさに及ぼす影響を検討した...|$|E
40|$|With an {{electric}} analog computer, an investigation {{has been made}} of the effects of control frictions and preloads on the transient longitudinal response of a fighter airplane during abrupt small attitude corrections. The simulation included the airplane dynamics, powered control system, feel system, and a simple linearized pseudopilot. Control frictions at the stick pivot and at the servo valve as well as preloads of the stick and valve were considered individually and in combinations. It is believed that the results which are presented in the form of time histories and vector diagrams present a more detailed illustration of the effects of stray forces and compensating forces in the longitudinal control system than has previously been available. Consistent with the results of previous studies, the present results show that any of these four friction and preload forces caused some deterioration of the response. However, even a small amount of valve friction caused an oscillatory pitching response during which the phasing of the valve friction was such that it caused energy to be fed into the pitching oscillation of the air-plane. Of the other friction and preload forces which were considered, it was found that stick preload was close to 180 deg. out of phase with valve friction and thus could compensate in large measure for valve friction as long as the cycling of the stick encompassed the trim point. Either <b>stick</b> <b>friction</b> or valve preload provided a smaller stabilizing effect primarily through a reduction in the amplitude of the resultant force vector acting on the control system.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of {{impedance}} controlled exoskeletons, common actuators have important drawbacks. Either the actuators are heavy, have a complex structure or are poor torque sources, due to gearing or heavy nonlinearity. Considering our application, an impedance controlled gait rehabilitation robot for treadmill-training, we de-signed an actuation system that might avoid these drawbacks. It combines a lightweight joint and a simple structure with adequate torque source quality. It consists of a servomotor, a flexible Bowden cable transmission, and a force feedback loop based on a series elas-tic element. A basic model was developed that is shown to describe the basic dynamics of the actuator well enough for design purpose. Further measurements show that performance is sufficient {{for use in a}} gait rehabilitation robot. The demanded force tracking band-widths were met: 11 Hz bandwidth for the full force range (de-manded 4 Hz) and 20 Hz bandwidth for smaller force range (de-manded 12 Hz). The mechanical output impedance of the actuator could be reduced to hardly perceptible level. Maxima of about 0. 7 Nm peaks for 4 Hz imposed motions appeared, corresponding to less than 2. 5 % of the maximal force output. These peaks were caused by the <b>stick</b> <b>friction</b> in the Bowden cables. Spring stiffness variation showed that both a too stiff and a too compliant spring can worsen performance. A stiff spring reduces the maximum allowable controller gain. The relatively low control gain then causes a larger effect of stick in the force output, resulting in a less smooth output in general. Low spring stiffness, on the other side, decreases the performance of the system, because saturation will occur sooner.

30|$|The {{change in}} the {{behavior}} of µ for specimens impregnated with the lowest PF resin concentration (5  %) was similar to that for non-impregnated wood. However, µ for a higher PF resin concentration of 30  % differed significantly, depending on the temperature of the metal tool surface. Thus, the softening and hardening of the PF resin-impregnated specimens has a large effect on the friction characteristics. When the specimens slide under softening, PF resin seepage through the specimen surface contributes to a decrease of μ because PF resin acts as a lubricant when it is not cured. However, under hardening, curing in the PF resin-impregnated specimens near the contact surface increases the sliding resistance on the contact surface and generates <b>sticking</b> <b>friction.</b>|$|R

Cast NAB is widely utilized by the U. S. Navy {{in the production of}} propellers for surface vessel and submarines. FSP is a novel method of deformation processing that is conducted by use of a rotating tool that is forced onto the surface of a material under load such that sliding and <b>sticking</b> <b>friction</b> result in a combination of frictional heating and adiabatic heating due to plastic deformation.

30|$|Friction {{that arises}} during {{processing}} for the {{deformation of wood}} under relatively high pressure levels (ca. > 1  MPa) {{is an important factor}} {{to be taken into account}} when wood is processed. However, few studies on such friction have been published. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the influence of surface finishing conditions on the nominal friction coefficient (μ) of the wood and metal tool surfaces. <b>Sticking</b> <b>friction</b> was likely to arise on a relatively coarse metal surface, and the type of metal tool surface finishing was found to have large impact on the friction mechanism. The friction characteristics during exposure to high pressure seem to be affected not only by the interface contact characteristics, but also by the deformation characteristics of wood during compressive load or measurement. The value of μ on water-saturated wood was equal or higher than that on dry wood, which suggests that the contact characteristics between these two types of wood are significantly different. The water content in wood was shown to affect both the interface contact and deformation characteristics of wood. The value of μ was not significantly affected by the wood surface finishing conditions; however, changes in μ during sliding differed slightly, depending on the finishing conditions.|$|R

40|$|A {{knowledge}} of the flow occuring in metal-forming processes is of great industrial importance, and the finite-element technique is the only form of deformation analysis which can predict {{the flow of the}} material. The examination of forging operations requires a full elasticplastic treatment to be used. This thesis is concerned with an elastic-plastic, finite-element program which has been developed to investigate three-dimensional examples of this process. The fundamental theory of the finite-element method is first introduced, and then the finite-element program is described in detail. The deformation, and distributions of hardness and die-interface pressure, predicted by this technique for the unlubricated upsetting of a rectangular block are compared with experimental results, and found to be in broad agreement, the differences being attributed to the incorrect imposition of very high friction by the friction-layer technique used in the analysis. With a corrected form of the friction technique, the finiteelement program predicts results for the axisymmetric friction-ring test and a new three-dimensional friction test which are in good agreement with experimental findings up to deformations of approximately 30 %; the friction-layer technique used successfully in previous axisymmetric treatments appears to be unsuitable for threedimensional formulations when large deformations are considered. The finite-element program developed here is shown to be capable of modelling an example of a more complicated three-dimensional forging, that of an automobile connnecting rod. The experimental measurements of cteformation and hardness for an aluminium con rod forged using graphite lubrication are found to be in good agreement with the finite-element predictions obtained assuming <b>sticking</b> <b>friction</b> conditions but not with the results of a zero-friction idealisation.
