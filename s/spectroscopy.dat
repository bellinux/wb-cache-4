5|$|Raman <b>spectroscopy</b> {{has good}} spatial {{resolution}} (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman <b>spectroscopy</b> {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{exploration}} of strategies for simulating lineshapes of optical <b>spectroscopies</b> of photosynthetic pigments and complexes. The {{first part of the}} thesis shows the effectiveness of a single tool, the spectral density, for reproducing high-resolution vibronic structure of single pigments.

Exciton mixing, spectral densities of chromophores, the use of multiscale modelling and the inclusion of disorder effects, together with a suitable level of open quantum systems theory, are successfully applied to the study of optical spectra and energy transfer dynamics of a selected light-harvesting complex-Peridinin Chlorophyll Protein...|$|R
30|$|It {{has also}} to be {{considered}} that measuring the surface composition of a material in vacuum (e.g. when using electron <b>spectroscopies)</b> or in an ambient atmosphere (e.g. vibrational <b>spectroscopies)</b> does not necessarily reflect the surface composition (and morphology) in an aqueous environment or blood. In situ measurements in aqueous solutions are much more complicated -if not impossible in some cases- and require specialized instruments (e.g. nonlinear optical techniques) not readily available in most laboratories.|$|R

25|$|The {{differences}} {{are much more}} pronounced in vibrational <b>spectroscopy</b> such as infrared <b>spectroscopy</b> and Raman <b>spectroscopy,</b> and in rotational spectra such as microwave <b>spectroscopy</b> because the reduced mass of the deuterium is markedly {{higher than that of}} protium. In nuclear magnetic resonance <b>spectroscopy,</b> deuterium has a very different NMR frequency (e.g. 61 MHz when protium is at 400 MHz) and is much less sensitive. Deuterated solvents are usually used in protium NMR to prevent the solvent from overlapping with the signal, although deuterium NMR on its own right is also possible.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of atoms into molecules {{leads to the}} creation of unique types of energetic states and therefore unique spectra of the transitions between these states. Molecular spectra can be obtained due to electron spin states (electron paramagnetic resonance), molecular rotations, molecular vibration and electronic states. Rotations are collective motions of the atomic nuclei and typically lead to spectra in the microwave and millimeter-wave spectral regions; rotational <b>spectroscopy</b> and microwave <b>spectroscopy</b> are synonymous.

Atomic absorption <b>spectroscopy</b> (AAS) and atomic emission <b>spectroscopy</b> (AES) involve visible and ultraviolet light. These absorptions and emissions, {{often referred to as}} atomic spectral lines, are due to electronic transitions of outer shell electrons as they rise and fall from one electron orbit to another. Atoms also have distinct x-ray spectra that are attributable to the excitation of inner shell electrons to excited states.|$|E
