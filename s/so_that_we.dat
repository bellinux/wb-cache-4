25|$|While the {{admissibility}} criterion guarantees {{an optimal}} solution path, {{it also means}} that A* must examine all equally meritorious paths to find the optimal path. To compute approximate shortest paths, it is possible to speed up the search at the expense of optimality by relaxing the admissibility criterion. Oftentimes we want to bound this relaxation, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can guarantee that the solution path is no worse than (1 + ε) times the optimal solution path. This new guarantee is referred to as ε-admissible.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, {{argued that}} all things have a {{universal}} form, {{which could be}} either a property or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.|$|E

25|$|And the captain-general {{wished to}} {{approach}} the largest of these three islands to replenish his provisions. But it was not possible, {{for the people of}} those islands entered the ships and robbed us <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could not protect ourselves from them. And when we wished to strike and take in the sails so as to land, they stole very quickly the small boat called a skiff which was fastened to the poop of the captain's ship. At which he, being very angry, went ashore with forty armed men. And burning some forty or fifty houses with several boats and killing seven men of the said island, they recovered their skiff.|$|E
25|$|On 27 February 2009, Sadiq Sheikh, an arrested {{leader of}} the Indian Mujahideen confessed to his alleged role in the bombings in a news channel broadcast. He claimed to have {{engineered}} the pressure cooker bombs with his associates in a flat in central Mumbai. If verified, these allegations could invalidate the previous claims by the ATS that the ISI or the SIMI were involved. Sadiq states in his confession, ‘‘All five of us arranged local first class train passes beforehand. We also had the local train time table with us <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could choose a train as per our convenience. We purchased bags and pressure cookers in Bombay.’’ He also claimed to have misled investigators by blaming {{the attacks on the}} Al-Qaeda.|$|E
25|$|Following a short {{service by}} the Dean, the Prince of Wales, who himself {{had served in}} the war, declared:I unveil this tablet in honour of our comrades, from every land under the Crown, who fell in the Great War. Time cannot dim our remembrance of them, nor lessen our {{gratitude}} to our Allies, who have given us the land in which many of them lie buried, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can care for their graves for ever. This was followed by the laying of a wreath, the dedication by the Dean, the hymn O Valiant Hearts (a war poem set to music to remember the fallen of the Great War), prayers, the first verse of the National Anthem, and the closing blessing. After the Prince and the Prime Ministers had left, the Abbey was opened to allow those waiting outside to join the rest of the congregation in viewing the memorial.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{the small}} stellated dodecahedron has 12 pentagram faces {{with the central}} {{pentagonal}} part hidden inside the solid. The visible parts of each face comprise five isosceles triangles which touch at five points around the pentagon. We could treat these triangles as 60 separate faces to obtain a new, irregular polyhedron which looks outwardly identical. Each edge would now be divided into three shorter edges (of two different kinds), and the 20 false vertices would become true ones, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have a total of 32 vertices (again of two kinds). The hidden inner pentagons are no longer part of the polyhedral surface, and can disappear. Now the Euler's formula holds: 6090+32=2. However this polyhedron {{is no longer the}} one described by the Schläfli symbol {5/2,5}, and so can not be a Kepler–Poinsot solid even though it still looks like one from outside.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of CMB is landmark {{evidence of the}} Big Bang origin of the universe. When the universe was young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was denser, much hotter, and filled with a uniform glow from a white-hot fog of hydrogen plasma. As the universe expanded, both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler. When the universe cooled enough, protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. Unlike the uncombined protons and electrons, these newly conceived atoms could not absorb the thermal radiation, and so the universe became transparent instead of being an opaque fog. Cosmologists refer to the time period when neutral atoms first formed as the recombination epoch, and the event shortly afterwards when photons started to travel freely through space rather than constantly being scattered by electrons and protons in plasma {{is referred to as}} photon decoupling. The photons that existed at the time of photon decoupling have been propagating ever since, though growing fainter and less energetic, since the expansion of space causes their wavelength to increase over time (and wavelength is inversely proportional to energy according to Planck's relation). This {{is the source of the}} alternative term relic radiation. The surface of last scattering refers to the set of points in space at the right distance from us <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are now receiving photons originally emitted from those points at the time of photon decoupling.|$|E

500|$|Haitian-American {{musician}} Wyclef Jean {{also serves}} as a producer. In addition, Wyclef Jean sings the first line of the second chorus in Haitian Creole. Richie said new artists were selected for the song so the song could be aimed at a new audience, commenting, [...] "We have a familiar song that kids learn in school. Why not bring in Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers and let them address the issues?" [...] adding that [...] "It was designed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> wouldn't have any of the originals there, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could pass on the baton to the next generation". Phillips said that the producers received 80 percent of the people they wanted as recording artists for the song. In addition to Jean, Haitian actor Jimmy Jean-Louis, most famous for playing The Haitian on Heroes, appears in the chorus.|$|E
