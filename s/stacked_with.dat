5|$|As {{impeachment}} proceedings began against President Johnson, Randall {{became one of}} his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be <b>stacked</b> <b>with</b> pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his speeches {{in favor of the}} president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{took office}} {{determined}} {{to reform the}} system of civil service appointments, which had been based on the spoils system since Andrew Jackson was president forty years earlier. Sherman was not a civil service reformer, but he went along with Hayes's instructions. The foremost enemy of reform—and Hayes—was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, and it was to Conkling's spoilsmen that Hayes first turned his attention. At Hayes's direction, Sherman ordered John Jay to investigate the New York Custom House, which was <b>stacked</b> <b>with</b> Conkling's appointees. Jay's report suggested that the New York Custom House was so overstaffed with political appointees that 20% of the employees were expendable.|$|E
5|$|Several {{minutes after}} initial radar contact the two forces sighted each other, {{at about the}} same time, but both Abe and Callaghan hesitated {{ordering}} their ships into action. Abe was apparently surprised by the proximity of the U.S. ships, and with decks <b>stacked</b> <b>with</b> high explosive (rather than armor penetrating) munitions, was momentarily uncertain if he should withdraw to give his battleships time to rearm, or continue onward. He decided to continue onward. Callaghan apparently intended to attempt to cross the T of the Japanese, as Scott had done at Cape Esperance, but—confused by the incomplete information he was receiving, plus the fact that the Japanese formation consisted of several scattered groups—he gave several confusing orders on ship movements, and delayed too long in acting.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{breakpoint}} region on the outermost branch of current-voltage {{characteristics of the}} <b>stacks</b> <b>with</b> different number of intrinsic Josephson junctions. We show that at periodic boundary conditions the breakpoint region is absent for <b>stacks</b> <b>with</b> even number of junctions. For <b>stacks</b> <b>with</b> odd number of junctions and for <b>stacks</b> <b>with</b> nonperiodic boundary conditions the breakpoint current is increased with number of junctions and saturated at the value corresponding to the periodic boundary conditions. The region of saturation and the saturated value depend on the coupling between junctions. We explain the results by the parametric resonance at the breakpoint and excitation of the longitudinal plasma wave by the Josephson oscillations. A way for the diagnostics of the junctions in the stack is proposed. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
5|$|The two {{possible}} stacked forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} are <b>stacked</b> <b>with</b> each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to the junction. Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single conformer. In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging the junction point appear to strongly prefer the conformer that allows a hydrogen bond to form between the second cytosine and one of the phosphates at the junction point. While most studies have focused on the identities of the four bases nearest to the junction on each arm, it is evident that bases farther out can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E
5|$|To {{show his}} {{commitment}} to reform, Hayes appointed {{one of the best-known}} advocates of reform, Carl Schurz, to be Secretary of the Interior and asked Schurz and William M. Evarts, his Secretary of State, to lead a special cabinet committee charged with drawing up new rules for federal appointments. John Sherman, the Treasury Secretary, ordered John Jay to investigate the New York Custom House, which was <b>stacked</b> <b>with</b> Conkling's spoilsmen. Jay's report suggested that the New York Custom House was so overstaffed with political appointees that 20% of the employees were expendable.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Hurricane Rafael {{is attributed to}} a low-latitude tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on October5. The wave remained disorganized until roughly midway between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles, at which time a broad {{area of low pressure}} developed and convection began to consolidate around it. As a result, the disturbance was introduced into the National Hurricane Center (NHC)'s 48-hour Tropical Weather Outlook with a low chance of tropical development. These chances were subsequently raised as further development occurred, with the system receiving a medium chance of development early on October10, and a high chance of development as it approached the southern Leeward Islands late the following evening. As the wave crossed into the eastern Caribbean Sea and slowed down, the previously broad and open surface low consolidated and became <b>stacked</b> <b>with</b> the mid-level center. The disturbance was already producing tropical storm-force winds, and as a result, skipped tropical depression status to become Tropical Storm Rafael at 1800UTC on October12. At this time, the cyclone was located roughly 200mi (320km) south-southeast of St. Croix.|$|E

30|$|Caffeine is {{not very}} soluble in water, due to its {{non-polar}} ring structure. Consequently, the molecules tend to self-aggregate and <b>stack</b> <b>with</b> each other on their flat surface like coins (Tavagnacco et al. 2011). In the presence of SUC, CAF would be drawn by a weak affinity to <b>stack</b> <b>with</b> SUC instead, which increases CAF solubility (Lilley et al. 1992). Both ASP and SAC also have ring structures, and they might similarly <b>stack</b> <b>with</b> CAF in solutions. But this is just speculation, {{and there is no}} evidence indicating that this structurally stacking contributes to the cumulative effect of CAF with the sweeteners.|$|R

25|$|Although Zhou left Sichuan {{to take up}} {{national}} leadership positions in Beijing in 2002, he cultivated a strong power base of patronage.

This time she did not {{continue}} to New Zealand, but spent 11 days at Sydney before starting her return voyage on 23 February. Because of the German submarine threat she attracted few passengers in either direction, so on her return voyage from Australia much of her passenger accommodation carried extra cargo.

25|$|So {{prominent}} was Hill on the issue, that in 1969 President Lyndon B. Johnson {{appointed him}} to the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. Father Hill and another clergyman on the Commission, Dr. Winfrey C. Link, believed that the Commission was <b>stacked</b> <b>with</b> supporters of loosening laws on pornography, and issued the Hill-Link Minority Report rebutting the conclusions of the majority report, which held that pornography should be decriminalized as there were no links between it and criminal behavior. The majority report was widely criticized and rejected by Congress. The Senate rejected the Commission's findings and recommendations by a 60–5 vote, with 34 abstentions. President Nixon, who had succeeded Johnson in 1969, also emphatically rejected the majority report. The Hill-Link Minority Report, on the other hand, which recommended maintaining anti-obscenity statutes, was read into the record of both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It was cited by the Burger Court in its 1973 obscenity decisions, including Miller v. California.|$|E
25|$|The living {{conditions}} in Mokattam Village, {{and the other}} Zabbaleen settlements, are poor. According to Assad, in the 1970s, “the streets were so <b>stacked</b> <b>with</b> heaps of assorted refuse {{that some of them}} could not be located. The air was heavily polluted by the smoke generated from fires that were either lit deliberately to dispose of unwanted waste, or resulted from the spontaneous combustion of organic residues.” There have been frequent fires in Mokattam, two of which were particularly severe and devastated the settlement in the 1970s. In its early years, the Mokattam Settlement lacked basic services; there were no health centers, pharmacies, or schools. Basic amenities such as piped water, sewage networks, and electricity were also missing. During the beginning decades of the Mokattam settlement, the community suffered from “high mortality and morbidity rates (especially among children), poor environmental conditions, and low income.” In 1983, the average household income per month was estimated at LE 70(approximately US$11.50 in January 2005) within the lowest 10th percentile of national urban income levels, with an average large household size of 8 persons. However, the {{living conditions}} of the Mokattam settlement improved after the Mokattam settlement received significant funding from the World Bank, in its upgrading program known as the Zabbaleen Environmental Development Program (ZEDP) in 1981 and from other international donors.|$|E

25|$|Carpentier, who was 36 {{years old}} at the time, became the {{full-time}} driver for 2008, part of a unique rookie class <b>stacked</b> <b>with</b> open wheel veterans all trying to emulate the success found by Juan Pablo Montoya the previous year. This included IndyCar Series Champions Dario Franchitti and Sam Hornish, Jr., and CART and Formula One champion Jacques Villeneuve, as well as DEI development drivers Regan Smith and Aric Almirola. With Valvoline taking a backseat role in 2008 and Stanley Tools moving to the No. 19 car, GEM signed LifeLock for eight races, an identity security company making a large entrance investment into NASCAR. Charter Communications and Auto Value/Bumper to Bumper also sponsored several races. Carpentier won the pole at Loudon but otherwise struggled, as did his fellow open-wheel counterparts. He had no Top 10s, missed five races — including the Daytona 500 — and was out of the Top 35 in points when he was released after Kansas. Second-year driver A. J. Allmendinger replaced Carpentier, after being released from Red Bull Racing in favor of Scott Speed. In his five races for GEM, Allmendinger was impressive, posting three Top 15's and often outrunning his teammates. Allmendinger was initially rewarded with a full-time ride in the No. 19 car, replacing Elliott Sadler. This was derailed when Sadler intended to sue the team and Allmendinger to keep his job, when Reed Sorenson was signed as a third driver, and when several sponsors threatened to leave the team in response to the recent moves.|$|E
