50|$|<b>Speculative</b> <b>damages</b> are damages {{that have}} not yet occurred, but the {{plaintiff}} expects them to. Typically, these damages cannot be recovered unless the plaintiff can prove that they are reasonably likely to occur.|$|E
50|$|<b>Speculative</b> <b>damages</b> are damages {{claimed by}} a {{plaintiff}} for losses {{that may occur}} in the future, but are highly improbable. They {{can not be used}} as a basis for recovery in tort or contract cases. Example: A plaintiff claims the tortfeasor's failure to deliver a shipment not only hurt his current sales, but also customer satisfaction and thus future sales as well.|$|E
40|$|In 1989 the Exxon Valdez ran aground {{and spilled}} 11 {{million gallons of}} oil in Alaska. Great {{controversy}} has surrounded the assessment of monetary damages for this oil spill. The source of this controversy has been the use of hypothetical contingent valuation surveys to assess damages to individual households, and the aggregation of these survey values over all households in the United States. The assessment prepared for the State of Alaska is reviewed. A number of issues of interpretation of advisory survey referenda are raised, each of {{which could lead to}} very different conclusions about the level of damages. The original estimate of $ 2. 8 billion is shown to be highly <b>speculative.</b> True <b>damages</b> could be significantly higher or lower, depending on a priori plausible assumptions required to interpret the survey responses. Given the methodological and policy significance of this study, such inferential uncertainty is unfortunate...|$|R
40|$|This paper recounts some {{well-known}} problems confronting European {{monetary union}} (EMU), such as withstanding asymmetric shocks and maintaining domestic political support. It then examines how a <b>speculative</b> attack could <b>damage</b> a target country’s banking system, {{and how the}} basic structure of EMU could facilitate its break-up. On the basis of this analysis, one might reasonably conclude that there is a significant chance – over one in ten – that EMU may break up in whole or in part. The paper then focuses primarily on two significant problems related to a break-up. First, a country seeking to leave EMU, particularly after the transition period, may have difficulty re-establishing its national currency unilaterally, as its economy is likely to have become thoroughly ‘euroized’. Second, any break-up accompanied by re-denomination of existing euro obligations, including government bonds, will create great legal uncertainty and costly litigation. There are no continuity of contract rules for exiting EMU equivalent to those for entering. Both problems require cooperative and deliberative solutions and will be difficult and costly to solve. If such problems are properly taken into account, which has not previously been the case, a euro break-up in the foreseeable future, particularly after transition, is considerably less likely than the above estimate of one in ten.

5000|$|The primary {{difficulty}} in {{the calculation of}} damages {{is the question of}} causation. Remoteness will defeat a claim if it depends on very hypothetical possibilities. In McRae v. Commonwealth Disposals Commission (1951) 84 CLR 377 relying on rumours, the Commission sold to McRae the right to salvage an oil tanker thought to be marooned at the specified location. Unfortunately, the tanker did not exist. The Commission argued the contract was void because of a common mistake as to the existence of the subject matter, but the court noted that the Commission [...] "took no steps to verify what they were asserting and any 'mistake' that existed was induced by their own culpable conduct." [...] McRae wasted money searching for the non-existent wreck. His claim for the loss of profits expected from a successful salvage was dismissed as too <b>speculative,</b> but reliance <b>damages</b> were awarded for wasted expenses. Nevertheless, the courts have been prepared to speculate. In Chaplin v Hicks (1911) 2 KB 786 the defendant in breach of contract prevented the claimant from taking part in the final stage of a beauty contest where twelve of the final fifty (out of 6,000 original entrants) would be rewarded with places in a chorus line. The claimant was awarded damages for the loss of a chance, assessed at 25% of winning the competition. The court seemed to proceed on the claimant's statistical chance of winning (as if she were a lottery player) without any actual assessment of her physical attributes against any particular criteria of beauty.|$|R
5000|$|Tort {{requires}} {{those responsible}} (or [...] "at fault") for harming others {{to compensate the}} victims, usually in money. Typical harms can include loss of income (while the person recovers); medical expenses; payment for pain, suffering, or even loss of a body part; or loss of future income (assuming that said loss can be proven to be reasonably likely to occur. See <b>speculative</b> <b>damages).</b>|$|E
40|$|This Note {{focuses on}} the {{protection}} of a copyright holder against infringement {{in the form of}} film piracy. It centers on the recent litigation surrounding Dallas Buyers Club, a biographical film articulating the life and events surrounding an AIDS patient, diagnosed in the mid- 1980 s, who pursued experimental treatments by smuggling pharmaceuticals into the United States. In 2013, more than 4, 700 Australian Internet users allegedly downloaded the film within the span of one month. In August of 2015, an Australian federal court declared that the studio behind the film would need to post a $ 600, 000 bond before it could send letters to thousands of Australian Internet users demanding damages. The decision creates a hurdle for studios and production companies, which have been accused of “speculative invoicing. ” This Note uses Dallas Buyers Club as a starting point to discuss the effects of film piracy and the issue of <b>speculative</b> <b>damages</b> as they pertain to 17 U. S. C. § 504, which addresses damages and profits surrounding copyright infringement. Moreover, this Note addresses the overall depreciation of the international economy resulting from a lack of efficient enforcement of copyright law, which stifles tax revenue and job creation...|$|E
40|$|Damage to fruit trees, tree {{seedlings}} and a {{wide array}} of ornamental shrubs by microtine rodents remains a widespread problem in both Europe and North America. Careful studies that quantify the levels of damage caused by a known density of rodent pests are not available. For this reason the orchard manager. Pest Control Specialist, and the researcher have a difficult time making wise decisions that are based on solid economic data. There are several reasons for this lack of knowledge. The damage done to apple trees is not easily observed, described, or measured. There is probably not a simple linear relationship between bark removal and economic damage. In addition to these difficulties and because the tree is a perennial, there is cumulative damage as well as recuperative and compensatory processes. In numerous situations, compensatory growth has been suggested and actually demonstrated (Dyer 1973, 1975, 1976, Dyer and Bokhari 1976, Harris 1974, Hutchinson 1971, Pearson 1965, Vickery 1972, Westlake 1963, and Woronecki et al. 1976). To date, only a few {{attempts have been made to}} address the economics of pine vole or meadow vole damage in orchards. Pearson (1976, 1977) and Pearson and Forshey (1978) examined the relationship between the presence of voles and tree damage expressed as a reduction in crop value. A few authors have made some theoretical and <b>speculative</b> estimates of <b>damage</b> (Kennicott 1957, Hamilton 1938, Garlough and Spencer 1944, Biser 1967, and Byers 1974). Recently Sullivan et al. (1980) have reported some standard survey work examining the magnitude and causes of tree mortality. This gives some concept of economic damage, but cannot be used to isolate even the benefits of current rodent control techniques. Ferguson (1980) and Luttner (1978) have also produced some very broad economic generalizations by extrapolating from rodenticide use figures. These, however, are only measures of standard acceptable orchard practice, and cannot form the basis for vole management in orchards...|$|R
