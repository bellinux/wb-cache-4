40|$|BACKGROUND: Ozone as {{a strong}} oxidant may induce an {{inflammatory}} response. AIM: The hypothesis was verified as to whether ozonated autohemotherapy using an ozone dose in therapeutic range changes the plasma concentration of C-reactive protein and interleukin- 6, markers of inflammation. METHODS: In a controlled, single-blind, cross-over study, 12 chronically hemodialyzed patients with peripheral arterial disease were exposed to nine <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> autohemotherapy with blood exposure to oxygen as a control followed by nine <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> ozonated autohemotherapy with an ozone concentration of 50 microg/ml. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between C-reactive protein levels at baseline (1. 53 +/- 1. 01 mg/l), after nine <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> control autohemotherapy (1. 48 +/- 0. 96 mg/l), and after nine <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> ozonated autohemotherapy (1. 55 +/- 0. 84 mg/l). There was also no statistical difference between the interleukin- 6 serum concentration at baseline (438 +/- 118 pg/ml), after nine <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> control autohemotherapy (444 +/- 120 pg/ml), and after nine <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> ozonated autohemotherapy (466 +/- 152 pg/ml). CONCLUSION: The {{results of this study}} suggest that ozonated autohemotherapy using an ozone concentration of 50 microg/ml does not induce an inflammatory response...|$|R

40|$|Although {{cryotherapy}} {{associated to}} compression is recommended as immediate treatment after muscle injury, the effect <b>of</b> intermittent <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> these {{procedures in the}} area of secondary muscle injury is not established. This study examined the effect <b>of</b> three <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> cryotherapy (30 min of ice pack each 2 h) and muscle compression (sand pack) in the muscle-injured area. Twenty-four Wistar rats (312 ± 20 g) were evaluated. In three groups, the middle belly of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle was injured by a frozen iron bar and received one of the following treatments: a) three <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> cryotherapy; b) three <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> compression; c) not treated. An uninjured group received <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> cryotherapy. Frozen muscles were cross- sectioned (10 µm) and stained for the measurement of injured and uninjured muscle area. Injured muscles submitted to cryotherapy showed the smallest injured area (29. 83 ± 6. 6 %), compared to compressed (39. 2 ± 2. 8 %, p= 0. 003) and untreated muscles (41. 74 ± 4. 0 %, p = 0. 0008). No difference was found between injured compressed and injured untreated muscles. In conclusion, three intermittent <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> cryotherapy applied immediately after muscle damage was able to reduce the secondary muscle injury, while only the muscle compression did not provide the same effectivenes...|$|R
