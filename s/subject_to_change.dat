In {{numerous}} situations, the underlying Markov chain is <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>changes.</b> For example, {{states may be}} added or deleted and transition probabilities perturbed. It is therefore, necessary to ensure the robustness {{of the system and}} to estimate the resulting deviation in the characteristics. In this paper we study the sensitivity of finite Markov chains <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in their state space and propose updating formulas and perturbation bounds...|$|R
