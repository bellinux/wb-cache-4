40|$|Silicon dioxide, {{in other}} words sand, {{turns out to be}} a highly useful helper for arc welding processes. It can be used as a tracer for a welding robot to follow the weld line and it can also make welding go faster and "deeper".

40|$|Abstract. According to {{the fact}} that the {{nonlinear}} magnetic control welding signal is not smooth, this paper proposes a signal extraction and an analytical method of the system based on Hilbert-Huang transform magnetic control arc <b>seam</b> tracking <b>sensor.</b> First, the magnetic control to track the signal motivated by cycle is decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions from high frequency to low frequency component by using the empirical mode decomposition. On the basis of the Hilbert marginal spectrum of each component, distribution of time-frequency transform to each component can effectively restrain cross terms and extract the real-time signal dynamic law reflecting magnetic control seam tracking. This method used in a certain experimental platform for magnetic control arc welding <b>seam</b> tracking <b>sensor</b> platform signal analysis, has produced a good effect and extracted the seam tracking signal, which can offer more valuable information and help to further reveal the frequency and spectrum characteristics of various interference sources in the weld automatic tracking system. Furthermore, It also provides a theoretical basis for establishing the welding signals with excitation source as well as a new nonlinear model. Welding electrical signal under strong noise interference is a kind of typical nonlinear an...|$|R
40|$|This paper first {{outlines}} the worldwide {{oil and gas}} pipeline laying situation by 2013 and industrial applications, the working characteristics and advantages of orbital pipe welding robots using the gas metal arc metal(GMAW). Then the classifications of commonly used welding <b>seam</b> tracking <b>sensors</b> are comprehensively introduced. The sensor working principles, advantages and disadvantages and the application situation in pipeline welding are analysed in details. The studies show that arc sensors and visual sensors have many advantages such as good real-time characteristic, informativeness and high tracking precision, and are most widely used in pipeline welding. Using single sensor in different process can limit the tracking precision easily, but a system with multiple sensors will greatly improve the tracking precision in oil and gas pipeline welding. A system using visual sensor and arc sensor {{has been used in}} the gas field pipeline welding in Japan and a good effect has been achieved. Finally the conclusion is drawn that suitable <b>seam</b> tracking <b>sensor</b> should be chosen according to the process features and methods, and using a variety of sensors can improve the welding seam tracking precision, which will become the focus of future researches...|$|R
40|$|Because {{of their}} {{construction}} and flexibility, industrial robots are suitable to be used, with a laser source and an optical fiber, for laser welding of 3 D products. However, the positioning accuracy of robots are insufficient for laser welding. Also {{the product and}} clamping tolerances are too wide for laser welding. These problems can be solved by applying sensors, which measure {{the location of the}} seam in real-time.

40|$|Robots {{have been}} more and more widely used in the {{factories}} nowadays. Arc welding {{is a very important}} application for industrial robots. However, how to eliminate the deviation caused by the inconsistent workpieces for robotic arc welding is always plagued operators. For solving this problem, researchers have developed different kinds of <b>seam</b> tracking <b>sensors,</b> such as touch sensor and arc sensor. Now, vision, as a widely developed sensor, is applied to be the <b>seam</b> tracking <b>sensor.</b> In this thesis, a vision-based seam tracking system is developed. The tracking sensor includes a camera and a structured laser. Rigid body motion and solid geometry are the base of tracking theory. For tracker alignment, eye-in-hand method based on relative movement of end-effector connected to a robot is proposed. It determines first the rotation then the translation. In addition, a simply method of calibrating the structured laser plan is given out. In Cartesian space, the position values of each feature point on the weld seam can be obtained though combining the parameters of camera and laser plane. Except the tracking algorithm, some image processing methods, such as mean-value, thinning and Hough transform, are used to improve the image quality and tracking accuracy. Finally, a series of experiments based on Motoman MA 1400 arc welding robot are setup to verify the whole algorithm and the reliability of the tracking system. The tracking accuracy we get finally is up to ± 0. 5 mm...|$|R
30|$|The seam bond {{inspection}} {{system has been}} integrated as the last station in the luggage compartment door production system. The inspection speed, means the speed the robots moves the door thru the <b>seam</b> bond <b>sensor</b> is actual set to 30  mm/s. Due to time restriction by the cycle time and time needs for handling the part the achievable inspection length is approximately 1  m in one cycle step of 90  s. Consequently, a complete inline check is not possible in the actual state. Instead, different over-lapping sections of seam bond areas are tested in successive luggage compartment doors so that the complete seam has been tested after four successive luggage compartment doors.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, new evaluating-algorithms {{as well as}} a new signal {{processing}} are necessary in order to react to these challenges of a inline inspection system. In this document attention is paid to two of these challenges by means of simulations and real measurements. On the one hand, the tilting of the <b>seam</b> in the <b>sensor,</b> on the other hand the evaluation method for the defect detectability in the seam areas a, b and c are presented.|$|R

During research, two-electrode textile moisture sensor has been developed to study its electrical properties. To define the optimal type of a sensor, several sensor samples have been made using different configurations of sensor electrodes, yarn type and distance between parallel <b>seams.</b> Samples of <b>sensor</b> have been tested in terms of signal detection speed...|$|R
40|$|Laser welding {{requires}} {{fast and}} accurate {{positioning of the}} laser beam over the seam trajectory. The task of accurate positioning of the laser tools is performed by robotic systems. It is therefore necessary to teach the robot the path it has to follow. Seam teaching is implemented in several ways: Offline Programming, Manual Point-to-point, Sensor Guided. The first two processes are time consuming; the second requires constant human interaction, whereas the last one is fast and fully automated. The most commonly used <b>seam</b> detection <b>sensors</b> are based on optical triangulation with a single structured light line. Such sensors impose restrictions on the laser tool orientation {{in relation to the}} seam trajectory. The shape of the seam trajectory in combination with the required speed, can force the robot into positioning errors due to robot dynamics. Furthermore, closed looped seam trajectories such as circles or rectangles are not possible to be taught with such sensors. A solution to these problems is given by the <b>seam</b> detection <b>sensor</b> of the integrated laser welding head. The developed perimetric sensor allows the detection and following of seam trajectories without restrictions on the relative position of the welding head. This reduces positioning errors due robot dynamics and allows looped seam trajectories. The developed integrated laser welding head fulfills two additional sensing functionalities: weld inspection and process monitor. The weld inspection sensor measures the weld surface properties and provides quality estimation according to ISO 13919. The process monitor sensor allows the detection of the keyhole formation in full penetration welding. The integration of these sensors into one compact laser welding head required the fusion of their optical paths. Automated calibration procedures have been developed for the system’s integration with robots. Finally, a user friendly sensor software application has been developed that allows access and overview of all the sensors’ processes and handles all required data communications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} {{method for}} post-weld quality inspection is visual testing by people. Major {{limitations of this}} method are the subjectivity of judgments and time required to perform the inspection. With {{the increasing use of}} laser welding in the automotive industry, the manufacturers are struggling with the challenge to automate the quality inspection process. This paper discussed the automatic post-weld quality inspection technology by computer vision sensing for mono-thickness tailored blanks of CO 2 laser welding. A visual sensor was developed for acquiring the original image of the weld <b>seam.</b> The <b>sensor</b> consists of a PC based vision camera and a stripe-type laser diode. An image processing algorithm was presented to detect the geometrical defects of the weld seam. Some experiments are carried out and some applications are given...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} in industrial robotics aims at {{the involvement of}} additional sensoric devices to improve robustness, flexibility and performance of common robot applications. Many different sensors have been developed {{over the past years}} to fit the requirements of different but very specific tasks. Special <b>seam</b> tracking <b>sensors</b> support the robot in welding applications. Vision systems are common in quality control and inspection. Force/torque sensors mounted to a robot’s wrist are still an exception and limited to the fields of scientific research. Compared to the number of annual robot sales the number of sensor equipped robots is still negligible, although the benefits of sensoric feedback are obvious. In this paper we introduce a general approach to tackle the problem of sensor-based robot assembly. We realized a flexible assembly cell that includes a variety of different sensors for mating with moving parts. ...|$|R

Because the vision sensor with structured light is strongly influenced by the arc light and spatter, the influence of arc noise to laser stripe image is studied. The arc noise model is established.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed series of {{measurements of the}} spectrum of the light emitted from a MIG welding are. This work {{was done in the}} framework of a larger project concerning the development of a <b>seam</b> tracking <b>sensor.</b> Detailed measurements and analysis of the spectrum produced from welding arcs have been performed. The measurements extend from the ultraviolet region of the spectrum (150 nm) to the near infrared region (970 nm) and have revealed the presence of many strong emission lines in the spectrum. The results are of great importance for the design of any optical or vision system working close to a welding are, because the wavelength of the optical system can be selected to be close to a value where the spectrum of the are causes the minimum interference to the laser light.

30|$|For {{testing the}} seam loop c a {{precisely}} teaching the robot path {{is necessary to}} have a constant position of the seam loop in the UT probe. However, {{the position of the}} seam bond in the inspection system can be checked using the ultrasonic signals. To determine the y-position of the metal sheet in the ultrasonic <b>seam</b> bond <b>sensor</b> (see Fig.  1), the elapsed time of the echoes from the water to steel transition of the two arrays A and B can be evaluated by using a defined time gate. This can also be done for the x-position control by using a pulsed echo measurement of array C. As both the robot path and the seam bond pack size are subject to deviations, a deviation of 0.4  mm in the x and y directions is considered tolerable. This tolerance window is set via the gate area. In the representation of the results in this document, this digital position evaluation is implemented using a red or green decision of the actual positional for validation of the measurement.|$|R
30|$|The {{non-destructive}} test systems returns a similar result. But a large defect {{can be seen}} in the left-hand section of the result image for area 1. However, the coupling evaluation shows a red coupling exactly for this area so that no adhesive evaluation can be given at this point. Reason for the red coupling could be air bubbles in the water layer or an overly strong tilting of the <b>seam</b> in the <b>sensor.</b> In area 2 of the Fig.  12 the destructive test reveals several meander structures. This is indicated by the yellow or red pixels in the ultrasound C Scan. However, the spatial resolution of the ultrasound system is less than the optical inspection of the opened seam bond. This is the reason why defects in the C Scan of the ultrasonic system look different and are more clustered.|$|R
40|$|A {{non-contact}} capacitive {{sensing system}} has been developed for guiding automated welding equipment along typical v-groove geometries. The Multi-Axis <b>Seam</b> Tracking (MAST) <b>sensor</b> {{has been designed to}} produce four electric fields for locating and measuring the v-groove geometry. In this system, the MAST sensor is coupled with a set of signal conditioning electronics making it possible to output four varying voltages proportional to the electric field perturbations. This output is used for motion control purposes by the automated welding platform to guide the weld torch directly over the center of the v-groove. This report discusses the development of this capacitive sensing system. A functional description of the system and MAST sensor response characteristics for typical weld v-groove geometries are provided. The effects of the harsh thermal and electrical noise environments of plasma arc welding on sensor performance are discussed. A comparison of MAST sensor fabrication from glass-epoxy and thick-film ceramic substrates is provided. Finally, results of v-groove tracking experiments on a robotic welding platform are described...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A welding <b>seam</b> {{tracking}} visual <b>sensor</b> {{based on}} laser scanning {{is designed to}} solve the problems, such as indistinct image, difficulty in processing image etc., caused by serious arc light interference during welding. This visual sensor is mainly composed of a scanning motor, a linear-array CCD, a scanning rotating mirror and a semiconductor laser. Because the sensor measurement precision relies dramatically on the rotate speed stability of the scanning motor, the crux in the sensor design is to control the rotate speed of the scanning motor. Selecting a brushless direct current motor as the scanning motor and using TMS 320 F 2812 DSP to drive it, we adopted fuzzy algorithm to control the motor rotate speed and made the steadiness error of the rotate speed less than 0. 5 %, which guarantees the sensor measurement precision and is of great importance for enhancing the welding quality of the industry welding robot. 1...|$|R
30|$|By {{means of}} these {{simulated}} A scans becomes clear, that a threshold {{value for the}} measurement regarding to the adhesive filling cannot be given {{under the influence of}} different angles of the impact. Through an adaption of the gain of the ultra sound signals, an evaluation with the integral energy method is possible. The total signal amplification is calculated from a fixed basic amplification and a variable gain component. This variable gain component is calculated from the amplification necessary to reach a maximum amplitude within a gate to a pre-set value. For the results in Fig.  8 right, the gate has been placed on the transition area from water to sheet metal. As the target value of the variable amplification the maximum amplitude is set to 90 % of the total scale. The subsequent evaluation (see Fig.  8) of the new A Scan shows under identical evaluating-parameters that a threshold can be indicated better by the integral energy method. Therefore, the use of a variable gain is necessary to eliminate the tilting influence of the <b>seam</b> in the <b>sensor.</b>|$|R
40|$|Through the {{two phases}} of this contract, sensors for welding {{applications}} and parameter extraction algorithms have been developed. These sensors form {{the foundation of}} a weld control system which can provide action weld control through the monitoring of the weld pool and keyhole in a VPPA welding process. Systems of this type offer the potential of quality enhancement and cost reduction (minimization of rework on faulty welds) for high-integrity welding applications. Sensors for preweld and postweld inspection, weld pool monitoring, keyhole/weld wire entry monitoring, and seam tracking were developed. Algorithms for signal extraction were also developed and analyzed to determine their application to an adaptive weld control system. The following sections discuss findings {{for each of the three}} sensors developed under this contract: (1) weld profiling sensor; (2) weld pool sensor; and (3) stereo <b>seam</b> tracker/keyhole imaging <b>sensor.</b> Hardened versions of these sensors were designed and built under this contract.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In the automated welding technology on three dimensional constructions, the welding tools will be proceed along the components of programmed handling systems in order to weld the components with each other. Tolerances while manufacturing result in the joints {{being able to be}} found at different positions. The deviations from the correct way are registered with the aid of sensors and transformed in control data for regulation of deviation. For this purpose, different models were developed by sensors which are mounted firmly in front of the welding tool and {{in such a way that}} it can recognize the deviations. In this case, the freedom of movement of the handling systems is limited at one degree of freedom. Abrupt direction changes lead to measurement errors so that the sensor leaves the measuring range. For this reason a new optical sensor was developed in this that is able to detect all necessary work parameters while welding. The sensor is based on the purposeful evaluation of structured illuminated projections around the welding point. The structured light occurs with a holographic projection system. An adapted preprocessing of data as well as a optimised rule-based recognition of the joint direction make also possible to detect complex welding joints in real time. The seam tracking system determines the position of the joint to be welded in the working area, the deviation of the welding head from the normal at the surface as well as the width of the gap between the components with a solution of 50 !Jm. The optical, mechanical, electronical and data processing components were developed for the high orders while welding with the laser. The use of this new <b>seam</b> tracking <b>sensor</b> allows the use of handling systems with only five axes at three dimensional joint geometries...|$|R
30|$|The {{sound field}} {{simulations}} can also demonstrate {{the relationship between}} the transmission measurement for the evaluation of the seam loop c and the degree of adhesive filling in seam areas a or b. The simulation results show that under identical excitation, detection and evaluation range the integral energy method within a gate G of a seam completely filled with air is 2.1 times greater than {{in the case of a}} seam bond completely filled with adhesive. This deviation between OK and not okay bonding is already reduced to 1.4 times if the defect area only extends to seam loop C. Subsequently, the selective evaluation of seam loop C by transmission measurement is only possible if this result is used in connection with the results of the pulse echo measurement of seam areas a or b. Consequently there are two conditions for the test of the adhesive filling of the seam loop C. First the position in x and y direction of the <b>seam</b> in the <b>sensor</b> must be within a certain range (±  1  mm). This is ensured by three impulse echo measurements of the arrays A, B and C. The second condition assumes a complete filling of the seam areas a and b. This is checked by the ultrasonic system. Only if both conditions for a test position are fulfilled, the validation of the seam area c is possible. In the present case, a negative adhesive evaluation for areas a and b has been established by the pulse echo measurement of arrays A and B. Subsequently, because of {{the relationship between the}} transmission measurement and the degree of adhesive filling of areas a and b, no result of the transmission measurement for the evaluation of seam loop c can be indicated for this test position.|$|R
