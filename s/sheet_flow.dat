50|$|<b>Sheet</b> <b>flows</b> (also called tabular flows) form multiple, {{overlapping}} lobes {{with steep}} margins. The flows typically lack central channels. They are flat-topped and generally about 5 km wide {{on the upper}} flanks of the volcano but become much wider and lobate toward their downstream (distal) ends. Most appear to originate near the Alba and Tantalus Fossae fracture ring, but the actual vents for the <b>sheet</b> <b>flows</b> are not visible {{and may have been}} buried by their own products. Flow thicknesses have been measured for a number of <b>sheet</b> <b>flows</b> based on MOLA data. The flows range from 20 m to 130 m thick and are generally thickest at their distal margins.|$|R

2500|$|This {{motion is}} thought to occur in two main modes: pipe flow {{involves}} liquid water moving through pipe-like conduits, like a sub-glacial river; <b>sheet</b> <b>flow</b> involves motion of water in a thin layer. [...] A switch between the two flow conditions {{may be associated with}} surging behaviour. Indeed, the loss of sub-glacial water supply has been linked with the shut-down of ice movement in the Kamb ice stream. The subglacial motion of water is expressed in the surface topography of ice sheets, which slump down into vacated subglacial lakes.|$|E

In a large long-term care facility, a diabetes management <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> was trialed {{to determine which}} clinical parameters were found useful by clinicians {{in the management of}} diabetes in that setting. MethodsClinical practice guidelines for diabetes management were reviewed with attending physicians. Diabetes management <b>flow</b> <b>sheets</b> were distributed for all patients coded as having diabetes on their most recent minimum data sets. After a period of 14  months, <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> completion rates were ascertained and physicians were surveyed regarding the utility of the <b>flow</b> <b>sheet.</b> ResultsInitial <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> data were completed in full or in part for only 57 % of the 121 study subjects; 39 % of the subjects died within 14  months.

50|$|The Taos Plateau {{volcanic}} {{field is}} an area of extensive volcanism in Taos County, New Mexico, United States. It is the second largest volcanic field in the Rio Grande Rift, spreading over 7,000 km2. The age of most of the vents and associated lava flows in the field is estimated to be between 1.8 and 4 million years, with a few 22-million-year-old vents. The composition of the lavas varies from tholeiitic basalt to rhyolite. Landforms include <b>sheet</b> <b>flows,</b> cinder cones, and shield volcanoes. The <b>sheet</b> <b>flows</b> are well-exposed in the Rio Grande Gorge carved by the Rio Grande. The highest point of the field is San Antonio Mountain at 10908 ft.|$|R
25|$|The {{channel and}} <b>sheeted</b> <b>flows</b> are then covered by high-magnesian basalts and tholeiitic basalts as the {{volcanic}} event evolves to less magnesian compositions.

2500|$|The Columbia River Basalt Group flows exhibit {{essentially}} uniform {{chemical properties}} through {{the bulk of}} individual flows, suggesting rapid placement. Ho and Cashman (1997) characterized the -long Ginkgo flow of the Columbia River Basalt Group, determining {{that it had been}} formed in roughly a week, based on the measured melting temperature along the flow from the origin to the most distant point of the flow, combined with hydraulics considerations. The Ginkgo basalt was examined over its [...] flow path from a Ginkgo flow feeder dike near Kahlotus, Washington to the flow terminus in the Pacific Ocean at Yaquina Head, Oregon. The basalt had an upper melting temperature of 1095 ± 5°C and a lower temperature to 1085 ± 5°C; this indicates that the maximum temperature drop along the Ginkgo flow was 20°C. The lava must have spread quickly to achieve this uniformity. Analyses indicate that the flow must remain laminar, as turbulent flow would cool more quickly. This could be accomplished by <b>sheet</b> <b>flow,</b> which can travel at velocities of [...] without turbulence and minimal cooling, suggesting that the Ginkgo flow occurred in less than a week. The cooling/hydraulics analyses are supported by an independent indicator; if longer periods were required, external water from temporarily dammed rivers would intrude, resulting in both more dramatic cooling rates and increased volumes of pillow lava. [...] Ho’s analysis is consistent with the analysis by Reidel et al. (1994), who proposed a maximum Pomona flow emplacement duration of several months based on the time required for rivers to be reestablished in their canyons following a basalt flow interruption.|$|E

50|$|Sand dunes {{can have}} a {{negative}} impact on humans when they encroach on human habitats. Sand dunes move via a few different means, all of them helped along by wind. One way that dunes can move is by saltation, where sand particles skip along the ground like a bouncing ball. When these skipping particles land, they may knock into other particles and cause them to move as well, in a process known as creep. With slightly stronger winds, particles collide in mid-air, causing <b>sheet</b> <b>flows.</b> In a major dust storm, dunes may move tens of metres through such <b>sheet</b> <b>flows.</b> Also as in the case of snow, sand avalanches, falling down the slipface of the dunes—that face away from the winds—also move the dunes forward.|$|R

50|$|The {{benefits}} ciénagas {{provided the}} lands of the Southwest were enormous. They not only provided a rich habitat for plant and animal life, but the combination of lateral spreading of flood pulses and abundant above-ground vegetation lessened the erosive potential of floods and protected the softer surface sediments. Broad ciénaga surfaces dispersed seasonal flood pulses into <b>sheet</b> <b>flows</b> and prevented the channelization fostered by the combination of insults outlined above. Ciénagas and grasslands formerly captured large amounts of sediment suspended in <b>sheet</b> <b>flows</b> that for the past 200 years have eroded barren soils in today's gully-washers, flowing through ever-deepening incisions or arroyos throughout the Southwest. The result is heightened flash flooding and exaggerated channel discharge that has reduced water tables and further exacerbated the already severe dewatering of ciénagas.|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} conversion in a methanol reactor is restricted by equilibrium, therefore the synthesis loop is operated at high pressure and unconverted gas is recycled. Such a synthesis loop consumes {{large amounts of}} compression work. In this paper a new <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> for methanol synthesis is presented. In this <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> the high recycle and operating pressure of the reactor is exploited to produce power. A turbine expander and compressor pair {{is placed in the}} recycle stream and utilises the reactor heat at the maximum possible temperature in a process gas power cycle. In conventional systems the reaction heat is often transferred to generate steam to drive steam turbines, but the heat is reduced in quality due to the temperature-driving forces in the heat exchange equipment. Simulation models of the new <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> and a conventional <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> are created to compare the systems based on energy consumed per kg methanol produced. In the conventional <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> the reaction heat is used to generate steam for use in steam turbines. In the new <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> a portion of the reaction heat is still transferred to a steam cycle to limit the temperature in the reactor.
