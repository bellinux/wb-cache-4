Arya reveals all of her family members and reveals that she had taken the Hound off her kill list before she left him to die. The Waif questions who the other names were on the list, which Arya reveals as Cersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, and Walder Frey.|$|E
5|$|Manchu shamans {{typically}} wore an apron, a feathered cap denoting {{their ability}} to fly to the spirit world, and a belt with dangling bells, and carried a knife, two wooden <b>sticks</b> <b>with</b> bells affixed to the top, and a drum they used during ceremonies. These attributes could still be observed among shamans from Manchuria and Mongolia {{in the early twentieth}} century.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these gunnery drills, Broke was fond of preparing hypothetical scenarios to test his crew. For example, after all hands had been drummed to quarters, he would inform them of a theoretical attack {{and see how they}} would act to defend the ship. Though the use of cutlasses in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called 'singlestick' was regularly practised. This was a game employing roughly similar cuts, thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass, but as it was played with wooden <b>sticks</b> <b>with</b> wicker hand guards; hits, although painful, were not often dangerous. It soon developed quickness of eye and wrist. Many of the crew became very expert.|$|E

5|$|Another set of officials, {{the chain}} crew, are {{responsible}} for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large <b>sticks</b> <b>with</b> a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people – {{two members of the}} chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.|$|E
5|$|Beyond French fries, {{the company}} has {{introduced}} several other side products {{over the course of}} its existence. Onion rings {{have been part of the}} menu for the majority of BK history. Originally made from whole, sliced onions, they were reformulated into a formed product made from onion paste in 2001 as part of a menu revamp. In the same 2001 menu revamp, the company added an onion ring-specific dipping sauce, and emphasized it again during its 99¢ BK Value Menu introduction in 2002. As part of its BK Cravers value menu introduction in 2005, the company briefly sold jalapeño poppers accompanied by a side of ranch dressing as part of its national menu. The same menu added mozzarella <b>sticks</b> <b>with</b> a side of marinara sauce; the mozzarella sticks have since been relegated to a regional menu item in the United States, but are sold on the national menu in Canada.|$|E
5|$|On {{their way}} to King's Landing, the king's entourage has stopped to rest at an inn. While the {{recently}} promised Prince Joffrey and Sansa Stark are walking along the river, they run into Arya sparring with <b>sticks</b> <b>with</b> her friend, a butcher's boy named Mycah. Taunting the boy, Joffrey draws his sword and demands a duel, under pretext of punishing him for accidentally hitting Arya, {{a member of the}} nobility. Mycah and Arya desperately explain that she asked him to spar with her so she could practice. As Joffrey savors the butcher boy's pain and fear, Arya hits Joffrey while her friend flees. Enraged, Joffrey turns on Arya and is about to strike her with his sword when her direwolf Nymeria bites his wrist. Arya seizes his sword and throws it into the river before running into the forest, where she drives away Nymeria and hides until dark.|$|E

5|$|Across {{most of its}} range, the pied butcherbird can {{generally}} be found breeding from winter to summer; eggs are laid anywhere from July to December, but mostly from September to November, and young can {{be present in the}} nest from August till February. There are reports of breeding outside these months, however. The nest is constructed of dry <b>sticks</b> <b>with</b> a finer material such as dried grass, black roly poly (Sclerolaena muricata), bark and leaves forming a cup-shaped interior. It is located in the fork of a tree, often among foliage and inconspicuous. The clutch consists of two to five (most commonly three or four) oval eggs blotched with brown over a base colour of various shades of pale greyish- or brownish-green. Larger clutches have been recorded, such as at Jandowae in Queensland, where two pairs laid eggs and were sharing incubation duties. Eggs of subspecies nigrogularis are larger, at around 33mm long by 24mm (1.3 by 0.95in) wide, while those of subspecies picatus are around 31mm long by 22mm (1.2 by 0.85in) wide. Incubation takes 19 to 21 days, with the eggs laid up to 48 hours apart and hatching at a similar interval. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial—they are born naked or sparsely covered in down and blind. They spend anywhere from 25 to 33 days in the nest before fledging, though may leave the nest early if disturbed. They are fed by parents and helper birds. Brood parasites recorded include the pallid cuckoo (Cacomantis pallidus) and channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae).|$|E

Most of the frontovik had a perevgzochnii paket (wound {{dressing}} packet), a razor, a shovel and would be very {{lucky to have a}} towel and toothbrush. Toothpaste, shampoo and soap were extremely rare. Usually <b>sticks</b> <b>with</b> chewed ends were used for brushing teeth. To relieve themselves latrine pits were dug, as portable toilets were rare in the Red Army. Soldiers frequently slept outdoors, even during the winter. Food was usually abysmal and often in short supply, especially in 1941 and 1942. The frontoviks detested the rear service troops who did not face the dangers of combat as krysa (rats). The frontovik lived on a diet of black rye bread; canned meats like fish and tushonka (stewed pork); shchi (cabbage soup) and kasha (porridge).”. Kasha and shchi were so common that a popular slogan in the Red Army was “shchi ee kasha, pisha nasha” (“schchi and kasha, that's our fare.”). Chai (hot sugared tea) was an extremely popular beverage together with beer and vodka. Makhorka, a type of cheap tobacco roiled in handmade cigarettes was the standard cigarette.|$|E
