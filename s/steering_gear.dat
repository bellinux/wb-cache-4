5|$|The ship damaged her {{propellers}} on 27 May and {{was under}} repairs at Chatham Dockyard until 4 June, {{when she was}} transferred to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla. She sailed for Le Havre, France on 9 June, to assist in the evacuation of British troops before advancing German troops (Operation Cycle). The next afternoon, she was severely damaged by three hits from German aircraft that knocked out her <b>steering</b> <b>gear.</b> Bulldogs crew was able to temporarily repair the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> and the ship reached Portsmouth Dockyard early the following morning. Whilst under repair, she was further damaged by splinters during an air raid on 24 August. Bulldog rejoined the flotilla after her repairs were completed on 2 September.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} Yhteissisu production {{was dependent on}} availability of German components; gearboxes and <b>steering</b> <b>gears</b> were from ZF, rims from Kronprinz, cardan shafts from Rheinmetall and Bosch supplied electrical equipment. These were later replaced by number of domestic options. The gearboxes were produced by Rosenlew, electrical equipment came from Strömberg, Hackman & Co. made rims, Fiskars produced leaf springs, the engines were made by SAT and Tampereen Pellava- ja Rautateollisuus, of which the latter one produced also front axles. Valtion lentokonetehdas made cabins and cardan shafts, Valtion Tykkitehdas <b>steering</b> <b>gears,</b> rear axle housings and wheel hubs came from Ahlström, drive shafts from Lokomo and rubber parts, including tyres, from Suomen Gummitehdas.|$|R
5|$|Despite these additions, {{the ship}} was still felt to be too {{vulnerable}} to plunging fire and Renown was refitted in Rosyth between 1 February and mid-April 1917 with additional horizontal armour, weighing approximately , added to the decks over the magazines and over the <b>steering</b> <b>gear.</b> Flying-off platforms were fitted on 'B' and 'X' turrets in early 1918. One fighter and a reconnaissance aircraft were carried.|$|E
5|$|Early Tiger IIs proved unreliable, owing principally to leaking {{seals and}} gaskets, and an {{overburdened}} drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle. The double radius <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> was initially particularly prone to failure. Lack of crew training could amplify this problem; drivers originally given only limited training on other tanks were often sent directly to operational units already {{on their way}} to the front.|$|E
5|$|Not {{all of the}} ship's mishaps were storm-related.

One fighter and a reconnaissance aircraft were normally carried.|$|E
5|$|Even before Monitor was commissioned, she ran an {{unsuccessful}} set of sea trials on 19 February. Valve {{problems with the}} main engine {{and one of the}} fan engines prevented her from reaching the Brooklyn Navy Yard from Greenpoint and she had to be towed there the next day. These issues were easily fixed and Monitor was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the East River preparatory to leaving New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> controlling the rudder had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder, which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> by adding an extra set of pulleys as he believed it would take less time. His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March. Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day, although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as he did not understand how the recoil mechanism worked on Ericsson's carriage for the 11-inch guns. Instead of tightening them to reduce the recoil upon firing, he loosened them so that both guns struck the back of the turret, fortunately without hurting anybody or damaging the guns.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, in April 1894 the {{completed}} hull passed static pressure tests. It was launched , 1894 during a fleet review attended by Tsar Nicholas II.

The builders hastily equipped the ship with rudder controls built for Poltava and delivered the ship for her sea trials on , 1896. The Navy desperately needed Sissoi Veliky in the Mediterranean and she was commissioned regardless of her known faults.|$|E
40|$|A {{fault-tolerant}} machine {{used for}} safety-critical tasks must a) guarantee {{at least a}} reduced-performance operation in case of partial machine fault and b) guarantee avoidance of drive mechanical jam/stall in case of total machine fault, {{to allow for the}} intervention of the back-up systems. Classical hydrostatic transmissions used on board ships for critical tasks such as rudder and stabilizing fin <b>steering</b> <b>gears</b> fulfill both the requirements a), b) above, but recent proposals for substitution with full-electric drives (rotary motors coupled with multistage reduction gears) usually do not. Especially the requirement b) needs particular attention and increased complexity when dealing with geared drives. This paper proposes a linear permanent-magnet direct drive fulfilling both the requirements above, for (but not limited to) rudder/fin <b>steering</b> <b>gears.</b> The absence of gears grants the requirement b), whereas the full-modular structure satisfies a), with independently fed stator modules and multiple inverters. This paper addresses some fault scenarios including electrical failures, in the machine winding (short-circuited coils) and in the inverters (trip of one or more units). The performance degradation is studied and assessed for the cases considered by both simulations and measurements on a prototype...|$|R

By this time, their role in Russian war plans was to defend the Gulf of Riga against an anticipated German amphibious landing.

She was commissioned by Captain Henry Tudor for service on the China Station on 28 May 1901, but her departure was delayed for several months when her <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> broke down shortly after leaving the base {{and she had to}} return. She eventually left home waters in early October 1901, arriving at Colombo on 7 November, and then Singapore on 16 November.

5|$|The {{third and}} most {{damaging}} attack developed at about 13:40. At least four bombs hit the ship's superstructure and caused heavy casualties among her 25mm anti-aircraft gun crews. Many near misses drove in her outer plating, compromising her defense against torpedoes. Most serious were four more torpedo impacts. Three exploded {{on the port}} side, increasing water flow into the port inner engine room and flooding yet another fireroom and the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> room. With the auxiliary steering room already under water, the ship lost maneuverability and became stuck in a starboard turn. The fourth torpedo most likely hit the starboard outer engine room, which, along with three other rooms on the starboard side, was being counterflooded to reduce the port list. The torpedo strike accelerated the rate of flooding and trapped many crewmen.|$|E
