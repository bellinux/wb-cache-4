Fiber dimension were also measured {{for evaluation of}} their suitability for pulp. Septate fibers, vessels in radial multiples. some ray longitudinallyfused are the main characters of Homalium and Trichadenia (Flacourtiaceae). Bucklandia and Distylium (Hamamelidaceae) are characterized by small and polygonal vessel, <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plate,</b> and disjunctive end wall at upright ray cells. Urandra and Platea (Icacinaceae) are characterized by two type of ray width, fibers with distinctly bordered pit, <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plate.</b> and yellowish wood colour. Four species contain fibers with medium quality for pulp (Engelhardtia spicata, Bucklandia triscuspis, Platea latifolia, and Trichadenia philippinensis). The rest four species contain fibers with poor quality. Trichadenia philippinensis {{is the only one}} among eight wood species examined which has decorative appearance : moderatelyfine texture, bright yellow in colour and considerable high density.

40|$|We {{developed}} a novel method for preparation of microcasts of wood with silicone elastomer (polydimethylsiloxane; PDMS). PDMS was so flexible and elastic {{that it was}} possible to isolate the microcasts by simply pulling them out of the mold without digesting the cell wall after the resin was cured for 2 days at room temperature. The casts of some cell wall sculptures, such as spiral thickenings and bordered pits, had high fidelity. By contrast, the casts of distinctly bordered pits and tails of vessel elements were often deformed or broken. Bars of <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> were always torn and remained in the resin casts. The microcast preparation using PDMS is useful for easy investigation of cell wall sculptures. It might be also useful for microfractography of bars of <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} ten species in five genera of the Cape Province (South Africa) family Stilbaceae is {{reported}} in {{quantitative and qualitative}} terms. Wood anatomy for stem, root, and lignotuber is reported for the monotypic Cape genus Retzia. Stilbaceae and Retziaceae are alike in wood anatomy but differ from Verbenaceae by having <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> with few and wide-bordered bars (simple plates and modified scalariform plates are also present); vessel elements clearly fibriform in shape; very scarce axial parenchyma; and long uniseriate wings on multiseriate rays. When added to endosperm presence and ericoid habit, these features may serve to segregate Stilbaceae from Verbenaceae. The wood of Stilbaceae is xeromorphic in having very narrow vessels, numerous vessels per mm 2, and pores grouped into radial multiples. The least xeromorphic wood within Stilbaceae is found in species from relatively moist montane localities; these species also have <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in vessels. The most xeromorphic wood occurs in those Stilbaceae restricted to lowlands or lowlands plus dry montane sites. <b>Scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> are interpreted {{as an indicator of}} primitiveness in Stilbaceae and Retziaceae, an interpretation reinforced by presence of borders on pits of imperforate tracheary elements in Eurylobium serrulatum (all other Stilbaceae have libriform fibers with simple pits). The rock-crevice species Stilbe rupestris has caudex wood specialized for storage, stem wood adapted for mechanical strength. Species characters appear to be related to ecology, but sampling is inadequate for establishment of many features as systematic indicators. Wood anatomy confirms close relationship between Stilbaceae and Retziaceae, and union of the families is endorsed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSections {{of fixed}} {{material}} of four collections of three species of Sansevieria were studied {{by means of}} scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to initiate study of distribution of vessel elements and the ultrastructural nature of tracheary elements in the genus. Roots of Sansevieria have <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in vessels; only tracheids are present in stems (=rhizomes) and leaves. This distribution {{is similar to that}} of genera of Asparagales claimed in recent molecular phylogenies to be close to Sansevieria: Dracaena, Ophiopogon, and Ruscus. Also similar in tracheary element types is Orchidaceae, now considered a member of Asparagales. Ultrastructural study of Sansevieria tracheary elements reveals intermediacy between vessel elements and tracheids because porose pit membranes extend across entire end walls of tracheids, and portions of <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> of vessel elements. This correlates with longevity of roots in Sansevieria, and probable moderate transpiration rates in leaves. In Sansevieria, as in other monocotyledons, vessel type occurrence, organographic distribution, and tracheary element ultrastructure relate primarily to ecology, although molecular-based trees, in fact, help understand the patterns of shift in ecological adaptation with attendant change in tracheary element structure...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomical}} characteristics for 21 taxa of Cassiope are reported. Qualitative features differ somewhat {{from the}} general pattern of the Ericaceae. However, considerable deviation {{is found in the}} quantitative aspects of the wood features. The stems are very slender with narrow growth rings evident in all but one species. Vessel elements are very small and usually have <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> with several bars. Vessels are extremely abundant in transection. Vascular rays are mostly uniseriate with a few biseriates and all are composed exclusively of erect cells. The imperforate elements are tracheids which are the only conductive elements in the late wood. Calluna-type pith is found in most of the taxa while homogeneous pith is found in two species. The recognition of these in the separate genus Harrimanella is supported. Cassiope plants are often found in moist, protected microenvironments in arctic and alpine areas of extreme cold and desiccating winds. Short growing seasons and low mean temperatures probably contribute {{in large part to the}} dwarf stature of the plants, which in turn accommodates the reduced vascular system. The tracheids provide a safe conductive system in the late wood which is less susceptible to loss of function due to air embolisms. The vessel elements with <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> accommodate the presumably slow conductive rates in the earlier part of the growing season. The vessel elements of Cassiope are considerably smaller than most others known to have <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> The values for vulnerability, an indicator of the degree of vessel redundancy and hence safety, are much lower than any yet calculated for any group. The same is true for figures for mesomorphy, which introduces vessel element length as an independent measure of degree of xeromorphy...|$|R
40|$|Fossil {{wood of the}} Atherospermataceae {{from the}} upper Cretaceous of James Ross Island, Antarctica, is {{described}} {{for the first time}} and represents the earliest record of this family in the Southern Hemisphere. The specimens are characterised by diffuse porous arrangement of vessels, <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> <b>scalariform</b> and opposite intervessel pitting and predominantly multiseriate rays which occasionally bear low, uniseriate margins. Despite anatomical conformity at the familial level, the fossil woods are not identical to any one extant genus and have therefore been assigned to the fossil organ genus, Laurelites Nishida, Nishida et Nasa, with which the fossils show greatest similarity...|$|R
40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} 16 of the 37 genera within the epacrids (Styphelioideae, Ericaceae s. l.) is {{investigated}} by light and scanning electron microscopy. Several {{features in the}} secondary xylem occur consistently at the tribal level: arrangement of vessel-ray pits, distribution of axial parenchyma, ray width, and the presence and location of crystals. The primitive nature of Prionoteae and Archerieae {{is supported by the}} presence of <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> with many bars and scalariform to opposite vessel pitting. The wood structure of Oligarrheneae {{is similar to that of}} Styphelieae, but the very narrow vessel elements, exclusively uniseriate rays and the lack of prismatic crystals in Oligarrheneae distinguish these two tribes. The secondary xylem of Monotoca tamariscina indicates that it does not fit in Styphelieae; a position within Oligarrheneae is possible. Like most Cosmelieae, all Richeeae are characterized by exclusively <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> with many bars, a very high vessel density and paratracheal parenchyma, although they clearly differ in ray width (exclusively uniseriate rays in Cosmelieae vs. uniseriate and wide multiseriate rays in Richeeae). Several wood anatomical features confirm the inclusion of epacrids in Ericaceae s. l. Furthermore, there are significant ecological implications. The small vessel diameter and high vessel frequency in many epacrids are indicative of a high conductive safety to avoid embolism caused by freeze-thaw cycles, while the replacement of scalariform by simple vessel <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and an increase in vessel diameter would suggest an increased conductive efficiency, which is especially found in mesic temperate or tropical Styphelieae.

40|$|Sections and macerations {{of roots}} and stems of Orchidantha maxillarioides (Ridl.) K. Schum. (Lowiaceae) were {{examined}} with a {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). Vessels with long <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> occur in both roots and rhizome; <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> have more pit membrane remnants in rhizomes. At least a few tracheids are present. The degree of <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> specialization correlates with the moist forest understory habit of Orchidantha, and {{is similar to that}} in primitive families of monocotyledons that occupy marshy habitats. Vessel data suggest a primitive position for Lowiaceae within Zingiberales in accordance with recent phylogenies of monocotyledons, but recent molecular data point to a position more nearly terminal in the clade; this situation needs resolution. Raphides are figured with SEM, as are starch grains with rounded outlines, the shape of the latter newly reported for Lowiaceae...|$|R
40|$|Small {{diameter}} pyritized axes, {{commonly referred}} to as ‘twigs’, of fossil platanaceous wood are described from the Lower Eocene London Clay Formation of south-east England. These twigs are characterized by solitary vessels with <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> opposite intervessel pits, and tall, multiseriate rays that dilate in the phloem region. The wood anatomy supports close relationship to members of extant Platanaceae and the material is placed in the organ genus Plataninium Unger erected for fossil woods with close anatomical similarity to Platanus L. This material supplements the fossil record of platanaceous type wood from the Eocene London Clay and documents the first record of Plataninium decipiens Brett in the twig flor...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of vestured pits in angiosperms is briefly reviewed. In some major clades, {{the character is}} of constant occurrence and thus very conservative; in others, it is more variable and apparently subject to both parallel origins and reversible losses. There is a striking correlation between the type of vessel <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> and vestured pits. Virtually all taxa with vestured pits have simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> This correlation, together with contrasting ecological trends for <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and vestured pits, has inspired functional hypotheses that vestured pits contribute to hydraulic safety. Whereas <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforations</b> may be instrumental in reducing the effects of freezing-induced embolisms in temperate to boreal and alpine regions, vestured pits {{seem to be a}} good candidate to facilitate embolism reversal in xeric and warmer regions with high transpiration rates. The presence of highly lignified structures within the pit chamber may influence hydraulic resistance, decrease vulnerability to cavitation, or help to repair embolism by compartmentalizing or affecting the contact angle of the convex air-water interface within intervessel pits. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Fossil {{angiosperm}} {{wood from}} Upper Cretaceous sediments of Livingston Island and James Ross Island {{in the northern}} Antarctic Peninsula region is identified as having the combination of anatomical characters most similar to modern Cunoniaceae. The material is characterised by predominantly solitary vessels, opposite to scalariform intervessel pitting, <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> heterocellular multiseriate and homocellular uniseriate rays, diffuse axial parenchyma. Anatomically, the specimens conform most closely to the fossil organ genus Weinmannioxylon Petriella which has been placed within the Cunoniaceae. The presence of Weinmannioxylon in Late Cretaceous sediments suggests that taxa within or stem taxa to the Cunoniaceae {{might have been a}} notable component of the forest vegetation that covered the Antarctic Peninsula during the Late Mesozoic and may therefore represent the earliest record of this family...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} 14 species of Clematis and one species each of Delphinium, Helleborus, Thalictrum, and Xanthorhiza (Ranunculaceae) is {{compared}} to that of Glaucidium palma tum (Glaucidiaceae) and Hydrastis canadensis (Ranunculaceae, or Hydrastidaceae of some authors). Clematis wood has features typical of wood of vines and lianas: wide (earlywood) vessels, abundant axial parenchyma (earlywood, some species), high vessel density, low proportion of fibrous tissue in wood, wide rays composed of thin-walled cells, and abrupt origin of multiseriate rays. Superimposed on these features are expressions indicative of xeromorphy in the species of cold or dry areas: numerous narrow latewood vessels, presence of vasicentric tracheids, shorter vessel elements, and strongly marked growth rings. Wood of Xanthorhiza is like that of a (small) shrub. Wood of Delphinium, Helleborus, and Thalictrum is characteristic of herbs that become woodier: limited amounts of secondary xylem, parenchymatization of wood, partial conversion of ray areas to libriform fibers (partial raylessness). Wood of Ranunculaceae other than Clematis has numerous narrow vessels, probably an adaptation to cold more than drought. Glaucidium has occasional <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> like those almost universally present in Paeonia, but the two genera differ strongly in other wood features. Wood of Hydrastis (<b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> occasional in primary xylem, rare in secondary xylem) accords with the idea that Hydrastis is a lineage that separated from the base of Ranunculaceae. Features that ally Ranunculaceae with other families of Ranunculiflorae include presence of wide multiseriate rays (without accompanying uniseriate rays), vessel restriction patterns, and storied structure. Woodiness in Ranunculaceae is probably secondary, at least to some extent; the woodiness of Xanthorhiza, thought by some to represent a primitive genus in the family, could be either primary or secondary...|$|R
40|$|A new silicified {{angiosperm}} {{wood from}} the alluvial sediments in Vážany nad Litavou (SW of Slavkov/Austerlitz near Brno, Vyškov district) is described. The wood is diffuse-porous with indistinct growth ring boundaries. Vessels are exclusively solitary with helical thickenings and <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> Rays {{are very high}} and up to 18 cells wide, homocellular to slightly heterocellular. Crystals are present in axial parenchyma mostly in chambered cells, rarely in idioblasts. The fossil is attributed to Spiroplatanoxylon mueller-stollii Süss. Other species of Spiroplatanoxylon are also discussed. Wood anatomical descriptions from {{the eastern part of}} the Czech Republic published so far deal either with the Silesian Tertiary or describe only partially lignified probably Quaternary material; therefore the present paper can be considered as the first detailed anatomical description of the Tertiary wood from Moravia...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} the single species of Plakothira, a {{recently}} discovered genus from the Marquesas Islands, is described qualitatively and quantitatively. Features new for the family include presence of vasicentric scanty axial parenchyma and presence of perforated ray cells. Plakothira has several wood features specialized for Loasaceae: vasicentric axial parenchyma, extremely reduced borders on fibertracheids, and storying in fiber-tracheids. Wood of Plakothira is clearly loasaceous. Storying in fibertracheids is reported here for the loasaceous genera Fuertesia and Mentzelia. Wood anatomy of Plakothira represents paedomorphosis in great length of vessel elements, erectness of ray cells, lack of change in large primary rays, and in presence of occasional <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> Plakothira has wood features maximally mesomorphic for the family, correlating with its cloud-forest habitat and semisucculent wood and cortex structure...|$|R
40|$|The Late Cretaceous {{and early}} Tertiary sediments from the {{northern}} Peninsula region of Antarctica yield a rich assemblage of fossil wood with well preserved anatomy.

These fossil specimens show greatest anatomical similarity to the organ genus Illicioxylon Gottwald and extant members of the Illiciaceae.

40|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscope (SEM) studies of tracheary elements of one species each of Sadleria (Blechnaceae), Alsophila (Cyatheaceae), Cibotium, and Dicksonia (Dicksoniaceae) showed that metaxylem of both roots and stems contains vessels with scalariform lateral wall pitting and <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in which <b>perforations</b> are like lateral wall pits {{in size and}} shape. In Cyatheaceae and Dicksoniaceae, rhizome tracheary elements are short, contorted, with numerous facets. Several end wall facets of any given tracheary element in all genera studied can be <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> At upper and lower ends of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> <b>perforations</b> have pit membrane remnants that contain porosities of various sizes, from large (nearly {{as big as the}} perforation) to extremely small (at the limit of resolution); the porosities are mostly circular in outline. No tracheids were observed with certainty. All tree ferns studied lack modifications of <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> like those of xeric ferns. The rhizome tracheary elements of Cyatheaceae are like those of Dicksoniaceae, but fusiform tracheary elements like those of many fern families occur in Sadleria (Blechnaceae); this correlates with the close grouping of Cyatheaceae with Dicksoniaceae in recent phylogenies that show Blechnaceae well removed from the tree fern families Cyatheaceae and Dicksoniaceae...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Different {{medicinal}} plant species {{can be sold}} under the same common name. Considering {{the importance of the}} correct identification, this study aims to separate, using wood anatomy, seven species popularly known as pau-para-tudo. The results show that Drimys brasiliensis is separated from the others by the presence of tracheids. Capsicodendron dinisii hhas <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and oil cells associated with the axial parenchyma. Axial parenchyma paratracheal vasicentric and in marginal bands beyond the rays' width, can separate Osteophoeum platyspermum from Simaba cedron. Handroanthus serratifolius has the unique presence of the axial unilateral paratracheal parenchyma and storied cell elements (parenchyma, fibers and vessel elements). Rauvolfia sellowii and Leptolobium dasycarpum can be separated by the number of square/upright marginal ray cells, greater in Rauvolfia sellowii. Thus, this work shows that wood anatomy is a valuable tool for species separation, helps with the identification and consequently is important for the quality control of plant product...|$|R
40|$|Eight wood samples {{representing}} six {{species in}} two genera of Scytopetalaceae are examined {{with respect to}} qualitative and quantitative features. Rhaptopetalum differs from Scytopetalum by having <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> fiber-tracheids, longer vessel elements, {{and a series of}} features probably related to the understory status of Rhaptopetalum is compared to the emergent nature of Scytopetalum. Features ofScytopetalaceae relevant to relationships of the family include (I) scaJariform perforation plates; (2) alternate medium-sized intervascular pits; (3) scalariform vessel-parenchyma pitting; (4) diffuse-in-aggregates and scanty vasicentric axial parenchyma; (5) axial parenchyma strands subdivided in places into chains of chambered crystals; and (6) rays that are high, wide, heterogeneous, and with erect cells comprising uniseriate rays. These features are compared for a number of families alleged by recent phylogenists to be related to Scytopetalaceae. Scytopetalaceae appears best placed in Theales, nearest to such families as Caryocaraceae, Lecythidaceae, Ochnaceae, Quiinaceae, and Theaceae, although Rosales (e. g., Cunoniaceae) must be cited also on account of numerous resemblances in wood anatomy...|$|R
40|$|Wood and bark of 12 {{collections}} of Empetraceae representing three genera containing seven species (one with two subspecies) are analyzed {{with respect to}} quantitative and qualitative features. Empetraceae have vessels somewhat angular in transection, with <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and <b>scalariform</b> to opposite vessel-ray pitting. Imperforate tracheary elements are all tracheids. Axial parenchyma is sparse and not subdivided. Rays are characteristically uniseriate and composed of upright cells (older stems have rays with both upright and procumbent cells). These features ally Empetraceae closely to Ericaceae and Epacridaceae. The narrow vessels, quite numerous per mm 2, denote {{a high degree of}} wood xeromorphy; growth rings and tracheid presence also may be indicative of adaptation to drought or physiological drought due to cold. Rays composed of upright cells, nonconversion of the uniseriate rays to multiseriate or heterocellular rays, and decrease in vessel element and tracheid length with age are generally accepted criteria for paedomorphosis in dicotyledonous woods, and these apparently apply to Corema and Empetrum as well as small shrubs similar to them: Cassiope (Ericaceae), Empleuridium (Celastraceae), Myrothamnus (Myrothamnaceae), and Tetratheca (Tremandraceae).

40|$|Gross and {{anatomical}} fentures {{of seven}} wood species from North Maluku were observed and described for identification purposes. Fibre dimension were also measured and evaluated for their suitability for pulp and paper. The colour of wood ranges from white to brown, mostly plain without figure. Only one species has decorative figure on its surface, that is Dracontomelon sp. So {{it is recommended}} for fancy veneer of plywood or for furniture. The main anatomical features of each wood species are as folows : a) vessels are exlusively solitary and aranged in radial groups in Calophyllum inophyllum; a few vesels are radially multiple up to seven cells in Heritiera sp.; (b <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> present mainly in Elmerillia sp. and rarely in Horsfieldia sylvestris; c) parenchymma bands are present in Calophyllum inophyllum, Horsfieldia sylvestris and Elmerillia sp. : d) rays uniseriate in Calophyllum inophyllum; e). fiber septate in Dracontomelon sp.; f) axical intercelular canals are present in Hopea sp. and Shorea koordersii; g) oil cells in Elmerillia sp. and taniniferous tube in Horsfieldia sylvestris.

40|$|The seven {{families}} hypothesized by Sosa and Chase {{to comprise}} Crossosomatales possess relatively long vessel elements with <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and <b>scalariform</b> to opposite vessel-ray pitting; tracheids; diffuse axial parenchyma; and heterogeneous rays. These and other primitive character {{states do not}} indicate relationships, {{but they do not}} offer any evidence against the idea that Crossosomatales are a natural order. Departures from the primitive character states are related to ecological adaptations. Crossosomataceae have simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> (<b>scalariform</b> brieﬂy {{at the beginning of the}} secondary xylem), a feature correlated with the seasonal aridity of habitats occupied by the family, the sole family of the order to exhibit such an ecological shift. Presence of tracheids (which confer embolism resistance to a wood) in ancestors of Crossosomataceae probably pre-adapted the family for entry into highly seasonal habitats. Minimal vessel grouping in all other genera shows that tracheid presence deters vessel grouping; tracheid presence also deters shortening of vessel elements. Autapomorphies are shown by Aphloiaceae (tracheid dimorphism, rays of two distinct widths); Crossosomataceae (<b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> predominantly simple, lateral wall pitting of vessels alternate); Geissolomataceae (wide rays); Ixerbaceae (ﬁber-tracheid tendency); Staphyleaceae (adjacence of axial parenchyma to vessels); Stachyuraceae (simpliﬁcation of perforation plates); and Strasburgeriaceae (large cell size). Although tracheid presence seems plesiomorphic in Crossosomatales, a degree of lability in density and size of bordered pits on imperforate tracheary elements probably occurs within this order and in other dicotyledon groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of functionally adaptive diversification of wood {{structure in the}} course of evolution as advanced by Carlquist is critically tested for vessel member length and type of <b>perforation</b> <b>plate.</b> The functional significance of within-tree variation in vessel member morphology is discussed first, and a criticism of Philipson & Butterfield’s theory for explaining classical length-on-age curves for fusiform initial length is given. At the genus and family level examples are cited which contradict the hypothesis that specialization of the <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> has a strong selective advantage for the occupation of more xeric environments or for high conductive rates. Other examples, however, seem to support this. The functional interpretation of correlations between vessel member length and ecological conditions is criticised. A comparison is made between whole woody floras or vegetation types with respect to the proportion of genera with <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 2). In tropical lowland rain forests the percentage of genera with scalariform plates is rather low. It strongly increases for tropical montane forests and for temperate to arctic floras. It is lowest in seasonally dry to arid regions. These trends support Carlquist’s idea that scalariform plates are, in general, only successful for conditions which require low rates of water conduction. In addition, the role of temperature is stressed. The total evidence presented in this paper is discussed in terms of random ‘patio ludens’ evolution which has to a considerable extent been canalized through selective pressures by environmental factors...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data were offered for 30 taxa of Meliosma and one species each of Ophiocaryon and Sabia; qualitative data {{were available for}} additional species of Meliosma and Sabia. For a small family restricted to mesic sites, Sabiaceae had {{a wide range of}} wood anatomical expressions (e. g., long <b>scalariform</b> to simple <b>perforation</b> plates; heterocellular to homocellular multiseriate rays; tracheids, fiber-tracheids, or libriform fibers as imperforate tracheary elements; presence or absence of silica bodies and calcium oxalate crystals in rays). Growth ring type, vessel diameter, vessel density, and vessel element length were sensitively related to ecology, but to degree of winter cold rather than to aridity. Ophiocaryon differed somewhat from all or most species of Meliosma in quantitative features, but the genera agreed in qualitative features. Some authors segregate these arborescent or arboreal genera in Meliosmaceae because of distinctive features of Sabia, a liana genus; wood of lianas differs in anatomy from that of trees, and these features account for the wood differences between Sabia and Meliosma. All wood features of Sabiaceae are widespread in the genera of Rutales (Sapindales), even <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> Sabiaceae are therefore best placed in Rutales, although wood of Sabiaceae is modally more primitive than that of other Rutales. Characters restricted to particular species were cited, but designation of them as diagnostic criteria was not advocated because the sampling of the family was rather incomplete...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for 21 collections of Berberis and one each of Epimedium, Jeffersonia, and Nandina. Most species of Berberis have {{large numbers of}} narrow vessels ~ixed with vasicentric tracheids. <b>Scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> are reported here only for Epimedium, m wh 1 ch they are occasional. Berberidaceae have living fibers (Berberis), fiber-tracheids plus living fibers (Nandina), or tracheids (Jeffersonia) as imperforate tracheary elements. Axial parenchyma is reported here for Jeffersonia and one species of Berberis. Previous reports of axial parenchyma in Berberis and Nandina likely refer to undivided living fibers, mostly intermixed with vessels, which are slightly shorter and with thinner walls and larger pit apertures than living fibers elsewhere in the wood. Woods of Berberis and other Berberidaceae are remarkably xeromorphic. The wide, tall rays of Berbendaceae, other than Jeffersonia, resemble rays of Clematis (Ranunculaceae) and other Ranunculiflorae. In dimensions, these rays suggest herbaceousness, but abundance of procumbent cells in these rays is not juvenilistic. No consistent differences in wood separate the subgenera Berberis and Mahonia of Berberis: although the two subgenera differ modally in several respects. Wood anatomy of Nandma IS {{very similar to that}} of Berberis, and segregation of Nandinaceae is unwarranted on the basis of wood anatomy...|$|R
40|$|Early {{angiosperms}} are hypothesized as constrained to wet environments {{where many}} of their defining characteristics evolved. A functional capability potentially enforcing the wet habitation of early angiosperms was possession of xylem with low hydraulic capability and drought intolerance. Recent studies indicate that a structural hallmark of these performances is long, steeply angled <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in extant basal angiosperms. However, Canella winterana (Canellaceae), a magnoliid, appears to have radiated into much drier tropical dry forest habitats despite possessing a wood vasculature structurally similar to hypothesized ancestral wet-adapted system for angiosperms as a whole. Based on a field study of Canella wood hydraulic function, we present ecophysiological data that basal vessels do not necessarily mark low resistance to drought. We found that Canella wood was resistant to drought-induced cavitation. Leaf hydraulic capacity as well as leaf pressure-volume relations and leaf water potential minima found for Canella were comparable {{to some of the}} most drought-tolerant tropical dry forest angiosperms. Thus, our results suggest that vessels of an ancestral design can be exported to dry environments. We found that scalariform-plated vessels in Canella were associated with low hydraulic capacities at the xylem and whole shoot-scales as well as limited plasticity of the xylem to varying hydrodynamic demand. Consequently, our results support the hypothesis that evolution of simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> not vessels per se, represented a critical adaptation for producing large hydraulic gains during angiosperm evolution across a broader range of environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of fossil wood and charcoal from browncoal deposits {{as sources of}} reliable paleoenvironmental information is explored with material from the Lower Rhine Embayment (Germany). The presence of charcoalified material demonstrates proof of natural wildfires in Tertiary mire environments, most probably during, or after periods of increased drainage and drying of surface vegetation and litter. The results presented suggest that sampling from charcoal layers may provide a more statistically reliable data set for study of such environments. Inclusion of taxa recovered from charcoal layers might compensate for the taphonomic and preservational bias of Tertiary lignitic floras {{based solely on the}} collection of lignitic wood. These data confirm the hypothesis that, during certain intervals of the Miocene, both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous angiosperms might have dominated or represented significant portions of the peat-forming vegetation. The importance of palms and shrubby woody taxa, such as ‘Cyrilla’, is particularly striking from new evidence of charcoalified remains. In addition, certain wood anatomical features observed from well preserved lignitic wood and charcoal may be used as indicators of environmentally modulated growth: (1) clear growth rings testify to the existence of a seasonal climate; (2) wide variations in growth ring characters indicate variable environmental conditions; and (3) high incidence of dicotyledonous taxa, with abundant small vessels and <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> is interpreted as evidence of a mesic environment...|$|R
40|$|Bordered pits play an {{important}} role in permitting water flow among adjacent tracheary elements in flowering plants. Variation in the bordered pit structure is suggested to be adaptive in optimally balancing the conflict between hydraulic efficiency (conductivity) and safety from air entry at the pit membrane (air seeding). The possible function of vestured pits, which are bordered pits with protuberances from the secondary cell wall of the pit chamber, could be increased hydraulic resistance or minimized vulnerability to air seeding. These functional hypotheses have to be harmonized with the notion that the vestured or nonvestured nature of pits contains strong phylogenetic signals (i. e., often characterize large species-rich clades with broad ecological ranges). A literature survey of 11, 843 species covering 6, 428 genera from diverse climates indicates that the incidence of vestured pits considerably decreases from tropics to tundra. The highest frequencies of vestured pits occur in deserts and tropical seasonal woodlands. Moreover, a distinctly developed network of branched vestures is mainly restricted to warm habitats in both mesic and dry (sub) tropical lowlands, whereas vestures in woody plants from cold and boreal arctic environments are usually minute and simple. A similar survey of the frequency of exclusively <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> illustrates that the major ecological trend of this feature is opposite that of vestured pits. These findings provide previously undescribed insights suggesting that vessels with vestured pits and simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> function as an efficient hydraulic system in plants growing in warm environments with periodical or continuous drought stress. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA novel {{device was}} {{conceived}} and built {{to measure the}} apparent gaseous permeability of porous media over a large range of permeability values (10 (- 10) - 10 (- 18) m(2)) and mean pressures (from 1 bar down to ca. 40 mbar). An extensive series of experimental data are presented and analysed for various porous media: (1) Norway spruce (Picea abies) and European beech (Fagus silvatica) in the three anatomical directions, and, for comparison, (2) three simpler porous media, i. e. an autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC, light concrete) and two wood-based panels. For all porous media, the intrinsic permeability, the gas slippage factor, and the effective pore size were determined from the variations of the apparent permeability {{as a function of}} mean pressure. These results are in good agreement with those of previous studies for spruce and bring new insights for beech and wood-based materials, in general. For all products, the effective pore sizes identified with the new instrument are closely linked to the medium morphology. In particular, it was found that in spite of the huge anisotropic ratios between wood's longitudinal and tangential directions, the identified pore size is similar and corresponds to anatomical features: openings in margo for spruce and <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> for beech. Besides, the pore size identified for beech in the radial direction suggests that radial permeability is most probably controlled by the openings in ray cells (either pits or intercellular voids) ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the iconic}} fossils of the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, Oregon, USA, is the Hancock Tree—a permineralized {{standing}} tree stump about 0. 5 m {{in diameter and}} 2. 5 m in height, embedded in a lahar of the Clarno Formation of middle Eocene age. We examined the wood anatomy of this stump, together with other permineralized woods and leaf impressions from the same stratigraphic level, to {{gain an understanding of}} the vegetation intercepted by the lahar. Wood of the Hancock Tree is characterized by narrow and numerous vessels, exclusively <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> exclusively uniseriate rays, and diffuse axial parenchyma. These features and the type of vessel-ray parenchyma indicate affinities with the Hamamelidaceae, with closest similarity to the Exbucklandoideae, which is today native to Southeast and East Asia. The Hancock Tree is but one of at least 48 trees entombed in the same mudflow; 14 others have anatomy similar to the Hancock Tree; 20 have anatomy similar to Platanoxylon haydenii (Platanaceae), two resemble Scottoxylon eocenicum (probably in order Urticales). The latter two wood types occur in the nearby Clarno Nut Beds. Two others are distinct types of dicots, one with features seen in the Juglandaceae, the other of unknown affinities, and the rest are very poorly preserved and of unknown affinity. Leaf impressions in and immediately below the layer containing the trees include the extinct genera Macginitiea and Platimeliphyllum (Platanaceae), and Trochodendroides (Saxifragales) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we aimed at {{identifying}} the anatomical characters expressing life history traits of woody species from the northern Congo Basin. We crosschecked three databases: the botanical inventories produced during the CoForChange project (857 spp.), the database of life history traits established by the CIRAD (France) and GxABT (Belgium) (464 spp.), and the anatomical database Inside Wood (761 spp. and genera for tropical Africa). A total of 155 shared species was obtained. We performed correspondence analyses between the anatomical characters and two main groups of traits: leaf phenology and light-requirement. Results showed: (i) that wood anatomy is involved in leaf phenology and light-requirement in a significant way (7. 56 % of the variance on axe 1), (ii) that evergreenness was correlated to IAWA characters 14 to 18 (<b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates,</b> e. g. Olacaceae) and deciduousness to characters 118 to 122 (storied structures, e. g. Malvaceae and Meliaceae), (iii) that pioneer (P) and non-pioneer light-demanding (NPLD) species showed similar traits but were different from shade-tolerant (ST) species, (iv) that deciduous and evergreen species showed separate distributions, and (v) that wood anatomy validated the well documented strong correlation between evergreen species and ST species, with an inversion of the tendency for deciduous species correlated to P and NPLD species. We conclude that anatomical characters {{can be used as}} indicators of life history traits in species-rich biomes. Further investigations are needed to increase the input of wood anatomy in explaining the life history traits in African tropical species...|$|R
40|$|Palms lack {{secondary}} growth so their primary vascular system is long-lived {{and must be}} minimally vulnerable to dysfunction. For water movement, the axial xylem must be well defended against cavitation. Climbing palms can be very long and represent a maximum solution to transport problems. How is this demonstrated in their anatomy? This article contrasts stem vascular anatomy in a canelike 2 ̆ 2 tree palm 2 ̆ 2 (Rhapis excelsa) with that in the American climbing palm Desmoncus and the Old World rattan genus Calamus. Rhapis, representing the basic classical palm vasculature, has a continuously integrated vascular system determined by branching of the axial (stem) system to produce leaf traces, bridges, and continuing axial bundles. Axial transport is favored over appendicular structures because leaves are irrigated solely by narrower protoxylem tracheids. Maximum stem vessel length is inherently limited by the leaf contact distance (LCD). Desmoncus is very similar except that interconnections involve more numerous bridges and axial continuity is less obvious. Both Rhapis and Desmoncus retain <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> in their stem vessels. However, Calamus lacks axial continuity because axial bundles extend distally into leaves as leaf traces but end blindly in a basipetal direction. The only interconnection is via narrow transverse commissures (not bridges). Calamus stem metaxylem vessels have simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> Resistance to water transport can be calculated, based on axial changes in metaxylem vessel diameter and is very high in the climbing palms. The unique features of Calamus may relate to safety of the hydraulic system as much as its efficiency, with Desmoncus an intermediate condition more clearly based on the classical model of palm vasculature. Calamus may have also evolved to mitigate the limitation of vessel length determined by LCD. Further anatomical solutions to the climbing habit in palms are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{great variety}} in wood {{structure}} of the large family Euphorbiaceae {{makes it impossible to}} describe briefly a general wood pattern. Nevertheless, a more or less clear division into four anatomical groups can be made. A short overview is given of the wood {{structure of the}} uni-ovulate subfamilies Acalyphoideae, Crotonoideae, and Euphorbioideae, following the classification by Webster. These subfamilies cannot be distinguished by their anatomy. The paper is mainly devoted to the bi-ovulate subfamily Phyllanthoideae. Within this subfamily, two groups can be recognized {{on the basis of their}} wood anatomy: the Aporusa type with a great number of primitive characters, and the Glochidion type, in which primitive features such as <b>scalariform</b> vessel <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> are absent. A short description of the 13 tribes is given as well as suggestions for rearrangement of the succession of the tribes. In several tribes some taxa are anomalous and, on anatomical evidence, exclusion of some genera, sometimes with assignment to another tribe, is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Wood of Bruniaceae is very {{primitive}} {{according to}} widelyaccepted criteria. Vessels are relatively long, with <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> having numerous bars, fully or vestigially bordered. Many aberrations in disposition of bars and <b>perforations</b> in <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> are present, and no species has exclusively normal <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> Lateral wall pitting of vessels, both intervascular and between vessels and rays, is scalariform to opposite. Vessels are solitary or nearly so, angular to round in transection. Helical thickenings {{are present in}} vessels of only a single species. All imperforate elements are thick-walled tracheids, some with gelatinous walls. Tracheids are only slightly longer (in two instances shorter) than the vessel elements they accompany in any given species. Axial parenchyma is diffuse, with very slight tendencies toward aggregates or vasicentric scanty. Rays are heterocellular, with a predominance of upright cells, or upright cells exclusively in species with very narrow multiseriate rays. Multiseriate rays vary from biseriate {{to an average of}} more than five cells in width, according to species. Uniseriate wings are present on at least some multiseriate rays in all species. Borders are frequently present on the tangential walls of ray cells, which tend to be thick. U niseriate and multiseriate rays are present in all species. Growth rings vary from absent to conspicuous, the latter mostly in montane species. Inconspicuous growth rings feature narrow vessels or narrow tracheids in latewood. More pronounced growth rings have more numerous as well as wider vessels in earlywood; vessels may be absent or nearly so in latewood, which would thus constitute an all-tracheid band produced annually. Crystals are present in rays of most species, sometimes chambered in subdivided ray cells. A few species have crystals in chambered axial parenchyma cells. Droplets or massive deposits of amorphous dark-staining compounds are present in all species. Woods of Bruniaceae are exemplary, considering their primitiveness, for adaptation to xeromorphy, based on current concepts of wood xeromorphy. Vessels are notably narrow or numerous per mm 2 of transection, or both. The nature of growth rings and of <b>perforation</b> <b>plate</b> modifications are suggestive of xeromorphy. Although species of moister habitats do have quantitatively more mesomorphic wood features, the span within Bruniaceae is not great, suggesting that wood of the family as a whole is adapted to extremes of water stress in accordance with the dry, hot summers, high incidence of wind, and porous sandstone soils of Cape Province, South Africa. Lignotubers have woods more parenchymatous and mesomorphic than wood of stems in the lignotuber- bearing species. Wood of stems does not differ appreciably from that of roots. Bruniaceous woods are most closely comparable to those of Geissolomataceae and Grubbiaceae, although other 2 ̆ 2 rosoid 2 ̆ 2 families have similar woods. This agrees with the 2 ̆ 2 rosoid 2 ̆ 2 placement accorded Bruniaceae by most phylogenists...|$|R
40|$|The phylogenetic {{placement}} of Kuhlmanniodendron Fiaschi & Groppo (Achariaceae) within Malpighiales was investigated with rbcL sequence data. This genus was recently created to accommodate Carpotroche apterocarpa Kuhlm., a poorly known species from the rainforests of Espirito Santo, Brazil. One rbcL sequence {{was obtained from}} Kuhlmanniodendron and analyzed with 73 additional sequences from Malpighiales, and 8 from two closer orders, Oxalidales and Celastrales, {{all of which were}} available at Genbank. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out with maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference; bootstrap analyses were used in maximum parsimony to evaluate branch support. The results confirmed the {{placement of}} Kuhlmanniodendron together with Camptostylus, Lindackeria, Xylotheca, and Caloncoba in a strongly supported clade (posterior probability = 0. 99) that corresponds with the tribe Lindackerieae of Achariaceae (Malpighiales). Kuhlmanniodendron also {{does not appear to be}} closely related to Oncoba (Salicaceae), an African genus with similar floral and fruit morphology that has been traditionally placed among cyanogenic Flacourtiaceae (now Achariaceae). A picrosodic paper test was performed in herbarium dry leaves, and the presence of cyanogenic glycosides, a class of compounds usually found in Achariaceae, was detected. Pollen morphology and wood anatomy of Kuhlmanniodendron were also investigated, but both pollen (3 -colporate and microreticulate) and wood, with solitary to multiple vessels, <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> and other features, do not seem to be useful to distinguish this genus from other members of the Achariaceae and are rather common among the eudicotyledons as a whole. However, perforated ray cells with scalariform plates, an uncommon wood character, present in Kuhlmanniodendron are similar to those found in Kiggelaria africana (Pangieae, Achariaceae), but the occurrence of such cells is not mapped among the angiosperms, and it is not clear how homoplastic this character could be.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{vegetative}} anatomy in phylogenetic analysis is documented. Examples {{of the use}} of vegetative anatomy at different taxonomic levels show the continuing role of the anatomical method in building a more natural system of classification of the dicotyledons. The importance of correlating wood and leaf anatomical features with ecological and floristic preferences of taxa is emphasized. Caution is required in basing phylogenetic interpretations upon similarities and differences in xylem structure. The transition from <b>scalariform</b> to simple <b>perforation</b> <b>plates</b> is the only aspect of vessel element evolution that is not potentially reversible and all phylogenetic analyses must reflect this important principle. Some groups outside the Magnoliidae (Annoniflorae) possess very primitive xylems and can be used as evidence to support a pattern of multiple early radiations of the dicotyledons, as well as the increased awareness of a lack of clear subclass definition. The application of anatomical characters in cladistic analysis is reviewed, and the need to utilize strictly homologous features, to provide accurate scoring of character states, and to give proper interpretations to character state transformations is emphasized...|$|R
5000|$|In {{secondary}} xylem - the xylem which is produced as a stem thickens rather {{than when it}} first appears - a vessel element originates from the vascular cambium. A long cell, oriented along the axis of the stem, called a [...] "fusiform initial", divides along its length forming new vessel elements. The cell wall of a vessel element becomes strongly [...] "lignified", i.e. it develops reinforcing material made of lignin. The side walls of a vessel element have pits: more or less circular regions in contact with neighbouring cells. Tracheids also have pits, but only vessel elements have openings at both ends that connect individual vessel elements to form a continuous tubular vessel. These end openings are called <b>perforations</b> or <b>perforation</b> <b>plates.</b> They {{have a variety of}} shapes: the most common are the simple perforation (a simple opening) and the <b>scalariform</b> <b>perforation</b> (several elongated openings in a ladder-like design).
