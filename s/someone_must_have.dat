5|$|When Tosca arrives {{looking for}} her lover, Scarpia artfully arouses her jealous {{instincts}} by implying {{a relationship between the}} painter and the Marchesa Attavanti. He draws Tosca's attention to the fan and suggests that <b>someone</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> surprised the lovers in the chapel. Tosca falls for his deceit; enraged, she rushes off to confront Cavaradossi. Scarpia orders Spoletta and his agents to follow her, assuming she will lead them to Cavaradossi and Angelotti. He privately gloats as he reveals his intentions to possess Tosca and execute Cavaradossi. A procession enters the church singing the Te Deum; exclaiming 'Tosca, you make me forget even God!', Scarpia joins the chorus in the prayer.|$|E
5|$|Desperately {{trying to}} figure out a {{connection}} between the murdered families, Graham realizes that <b>someone</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> seen their home movies. He and Crawford deduce where the films were processed. They identify the lab in St. Louis and fly there immediately. Dollarhyde has been casing the victims' homes through home movies, enabling him to prepare for the break-ins in extreme detail. Graham determines which employees that match their profile information have seen these films and obtains Dollarhyde's home address, to which he and Crawford travel with a police escort. At Dollarhyde's home, Reba is terrified as he contemplates what to do with her. As he struggles to kill Reba with a piece of broken mirror glass, police teams assemble around the house. Seeing that Dollarhyde has someone inside with him, Graham lunges through a window. He is quickly subdued by Dollarhyde, who retrieves a shotgun and uses it to wound Crawford and kill two police officers. Wounded in the firefight, Dollarhyde returns to the kitchen to shoot Graham, but misses because of his injuries and is killed himself when Graham returns fire. Graham, Reba, and Crawford are tended to by paramedics before Graham returns home and retires permanently.|$|E
25|$|The {{morning after}} the raid, Japp phones Poirot to tell him they found jewels {{in the pocket of}} Professor Liskeard but he has been set up. However no dope was {{discovered}} so <b>someone</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> removed it from the club. Poirot tells the astonished Japp that he was responsible, and then puts the phone down.|$|E
5000|$|Falling {{short of}} this goal in one round means {{you will get}} plucked at the {{beginning}} of the next round. If you fell short, <b>someone</b> else <b>must</b> <b>have</b> an excess—and that person is the one who gets to pluck from you! ...|$|R
5000|$|... (d) One of {{the towers}} held a short {{inscription}} that {{was in one of}} the ancient languages of the Quraquans. This was bewildering because the Quraquans never developed space travel; <b>someone</b> else <b>must</b> <b>have</b> inscribed it. Although they could identify the language, they could not read the inscription.|$|R
50|$|In January 2008, former PR-contact and Editor in Chief Kenny Lammers {{got into}} a car accident. While his car ended up a {{complete}} wreck, he and his girlfriend got out with a scare and some bruises. According to Kenny, <b>someone</b> above <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been watching over him. The circumstances involving the accident are unknown, but fatigue was certainly amongst the causes.|$|R
25|$|During {{a search}} among Mrs McGinty's possessions, Poirot finds a {{newspaper}} from which an {{article has been}} cut out. The newspaper is dated {{a few days before}} the murder. He later discovers that the missing article is about women connected with famous murder cases, and includes photographs of them. He also discovers that Mrs McGinty had purchased a bottle of ink in a local shop shortly before her murder. He concludes that she had recognised one of the women in the article, and had written to the paper in question. <b>Someone</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> found out about it and then killed her to prevent her from talking. Poirot and Spence, using the ages of people in the town, conclude that someone is either Lily Gamboll, who committed murder with a meat cleaver as a child, or Eva Kane, who had been the love interest who inspired a man to murder his wife and bury her in a cellar. Another possibility is that someone is Evelyn Hope, the daughter of Eva Kane. Shortly afterwards, Poirot discovers the murder weapon, a sugar hammer, left around in plain sight at his boarding house and accessible to all the suspects. In an attempt to flush out the murderer, Poirot claims to know more than he does and is nearly pushed under an oncoming train. Poirot decides to show most of the suspects the photos at a party. Mrs Upward claims to have seen the photo of Lily Gamboll, but does not say where.|$|E
25|$|As noted, a {{few months}} after his {{appointment}} as ABA President Ehnat was fired by the ABA under bad circumstances and was replaced by the new ABA management by Clayton John, a former motorcycle racer and BMX track operator and who is still the current (2006) ABA President. Ehnat became Vice President of the USBA and became active in the campaign to shore up the image of the USBA which was beginning to take damaging hits in the BMX industry, including its dealings with disgraced BMX promoter Renny Roker. Bob Hadley*, team manager of the Huffy BMX team noticed at one time that Erhart was pretty prescient in questions he had with him even before he mentioned them. At the time only Clayton John was privy to the specific concerns in a letter Mr. Hadley had that he had shared only with Mr. John at the time. The timing of Ehnat responses {{and the fact that the}} USBA seemed to always be one step ahead of the ABA in court actions was so uncanny Mr. Hadley joked that <b>someone</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> bugged Mr. John's office. Clayton John took the whimsical joke seriously and had ABA headquarters swept for bugs by experts in counter surveillance and corporate espionage. After the sweep, two experts, one a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent and the other a former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent found evidence of tampering in one of the telephone trunk lines leading to Mr. John's office. The lines were stripped in a way that it was evidence that a telephone tap was in place at some time. No conclusive proof only circumstantial evidence has suggested that the USBA was responsible. Another suspect, the IRS could have done it given the pressure they put the ABA under, including showing up during ABA nationals but aside from it being illegal without a court order, the IRS had perfectly legal ways available to them to get once sensitive information about the ABA, including financial assets. Most of it was public record particularly court proceedings. The IRS had no real motive to go through the unnecessary risk of wire-tapping the ABA offices.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of June 1987 three attacks were made against {{soldiers}} of the same company of 7/10 UDR including Private Joe Tracey who was shot dead as he started a new job on apartments off the Lisburn Road, Belfast. [...] The Belfast Newsletter reported that 7/10 UDR had been infiltrated by the IRA.

50|$|Another {{argument}} that challenges the co-authorship {{idea is that}} the basic theory of co-authorship itself was originally hypothesised in the 18th and 19th century due to a distaste for the treatment of Joan. Critics were uncomfortable attributing such a harsh depiction to Shakespeare, so they embraced the co-authorship theory to 'clear his name'—suggesting that he couldn't have been responsible for the merciless characterisation of Joan, and as such, <b>someone</b> else <b>must</b> <b>have</b> written her scenes.|$|R
2500|$|Ford was legendary for his {{discipline}} and efficiency on-set and was notorious for being extremely tough on his actors, frequently mocking, yelling and bullying them; {{he was also}} infamous for his sometimes sadistic practical jokes. Any actor foolish enough to demand star treatment would receive {{the full force of}} his relentless scorn and sarcasm. He once referred to John Wayne as a [...] "big idiot" [...] and even punched Henry Fonda. Henry Brandon (who played Chief Scar from The Searchers) once referred to Ford as [...] "the only man who could make John Wayne cry"[...] He likewise belittled Victor McLaglen, on one occasion reportedly bellowing through the megaphone: [...] "D'ya known, McLaglen, that Fox are paying you $1200 a week to do things that I could get any child off the street to do better?". Stock Company veteran Ward Bond was reportedly one of the few actors who were impervious to Ford's taunting and sarcasms. Sir Donald Sinden, then a contract star for the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios when he starred in Mogambo, was not the only person to suffer at the hands of John Ford's notorious behaviour. He recalls [...] "Ten White Hunters were seconded to our unit for our protection and to provide fresh meat. Among them was Marcus, Lord Wallscourt, a delightful man whom Ford treated abysmally—sometimes very sadistically. In Ford's eyes the poor man could do nothing right and was continually being bawled {{out in front of the}} entire unit (in some ways he occasionally took the heat off me). None of us could understand the reason for this appalling treatment, which the dear kind man in no way deserved. He himself was quite at a loss. Several weeks later we discovered the cause from Ford's brother-in-law: before emigrating to America, Ford's grandfather had been a labourer on the estate in Ireland of the then Lord Wallscourt: Ford was now getting his own back at his descendant. Not a charming sight." [...] "We now had to return to the MGM-British Studios in London to shoot all the interior scenes. <b>Someone</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> pointed out to Ford that he had been thoroughly foul to me during the entire location shoot and when I arrived for my first day's work, I found that he had caused a large notice to be painted at the entrance to our sound stage in capital letters reading BE KIND TO DONALD WEEK. He was as good as his word—for precisely seven days. On the eighth day he ripped the sign down and returned to his normal bullying behaviour." ...|$|E

50|$|Elements of {{accomplice}} liability:• Accomplice liability is accessory in nature. <b>Someone</b> else <b>must</b> <b>have</b> first {{initiated the}} unlawful act or acts.• Unlawful conduct here may take various forms, such as facilitating.

500|$|Experience {{had taught}} me this: {{to find out what}} you’re capable of, it is only {{necessary}} {{to get a chance to}} do it—and <b>someone</b> else <b>must</b> <b>have</b> enough confidence in you to provide that chance. In my dealings with the young RCNVR captains I did my best to give them the opportunity to find their own feet and they did it. Once having tasted success they never looked back.

Walter explains he believes the creature is a man-made chimera, which has the best genetic traits of many different creatures, including a lizard, bat, and wasp. He had tried to create the creature years before, but his experiments failed, and concludes that <b>someone</b> else <b>must</b> <b>have</b> taken up his research.

Their goal is to make contact with Aayan Ibrahim (Suraj Sharma). Fara makes the first attempt, visiting Aayan's school posing as a journalist from London. Aayan refuses to speak to her and leaves immediately. Fara reports back to Carrie that Aayan was [...] "terrified".

Perhaps unknowing, she had fallen to sleep for a few minutes. Madame Lelanne was seated by the stove, her great coarse hands upon her knees, her patient, dull, slow-moving eyes fixed upon the speaker's face. Dubos was half standing, half resting against the table, his arms folded upon his breast. The wounded men had raised themselves upon the straw and were listening. Some leant upon their elbows, some sat with their hands clasped round their knees, and one, with head bent down, remained with his face hidden in his hands.|$|R

Hilda is willing to believe that Alex is genuinely contrite, and agrees to let the council decide on whether to accept him back; however, Brother Will is not convinced and vows that Alex will only be welcomed back into the fold over his dead body. Alex thus sets about arranging this through his ally, the weak-willed Brother Dafydd. Dafydd has always agreed with Alex that Hilda’s way is too slow and uncertain, and although he is unwilling to commit murder for Alex’s sake, Dafydd agrees to lure Brother Will to a certain spot on the clifftop, where Alex will deal with him.|$|R
