30|$|I {{have used}} {{administrative}} linked employer-employee {{data from the}} German Federal Statistical Office (German <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Earnings</b> Survey 2006) to estimate the wage differentials between workers with FTCs and with permanent contracts. Mean wage differentials and wage differentials across the wage distribution are significantly negative to the disadvantage of workers with FTCs. Worker characteristics account for {{about half of the}} unconditional mean wage differential. The wage disadvantage of workers with FTCs is further significantly reduced by the inclusion of occupation and firm fixed effects. Quantile regressions have additionally shown that the wage differential is larger at the lower tail of the wage distribution but still significant in the middle and upper parts of the wage distribution. Overall, the findings show neither any evidence for compensating wage differentials nor evidence for equal pay, despite legislation on the latter. Due to the cross section nature of the German <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Earnings</b> Survey, no worker fixed effects could be taken into account, which might be another important source of omitted variable bias (Mertens and McGinnity 2004) than analyzed in this paper, which has explicitly dealt with firm heterogeneity.

40|$|Purpose/objective: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the influence of the 2008 xenophobic events on the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> of street traders in inner-city Johannesburg and to provide recommendations to policymakers. Problem investigated: The xenophobic events of 2008 are well documented, but absent from the literature is the potential influence on the earnings of foreign street traders. This study investigates this influence through analysis of data from before and after the events. Design and methodology: The study applies an exploratory cross-sectional research design using data from three different samples. Mann-Whitney and Chi-squared measures are applied together with exploratory multiple linear regression analysis to generate insight into the relationships between earnings and differences by origin. Findings and implications: In 2009 the earnings structure of the sector changed. In 2008 and 2010, the earnings of foreign traders are higher, whereas in 2009 these traders earned less than local traders. It is argued that the xenophobic events might have resulted in a temporary restructuring of earnings. Originality or value of the research: This study makes a contribution through exploratory findings that document a change in the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> of foreign street traders.

30|$|From an {{empirical}} perspective, {{it is well}} established that workers with fixed-term contracts (FTCs) earn on average significant lower wages than workers with permanent contracts. Some studies also explore the wage differentials across the wage distribution and find larger than average wage differentials at the lower tail of the wage distribution and low but still significant wage disadvantages for FTCs {{at the top of}} the wage distribution. Due to data limitations previous studies, at least for Germany, suffer from the absence of the information about a worker’s workplace so that within-firm wage differentials cannot be estimated. Consequently, the estimated wage differentials might suffer from an omitted variable bias due to unobserved firm characteristics. In order to deal with this issue, I use an administrative linked employer-employee data set from the German Federal Statistical Office—the German <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Earnings</b> Survey 2006. Due to its large sample size, the German <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Earnings</b> Survey is also more suitable to analyze the wage differentials across the wage distribution than smaller survey data sets.|$|E

The model suggests that wage dynamics should {{be thought of as}} the outcome of a specific acceptance/rejection scheme of i. i. d. productivity shocks.
