40|$|Fusicoccin affects several {{physiological}} processes {{regulated by}} the plasma membrane H(+) -ATPase in higher plants while other organisms having P-type H(+) -ATPases (e. g., fungi) are fusicoccin-insensitive. We have previously shown that fusicoccin binding to its receptor is necessary for H(+) -ATPase stimulation and have achieved the functional reconstitution into liposomes of fusicoccin receptors and the H(+) -ATPase <b>from</b> <b>maize.</b> In this paper we show that fusicoccin sensitivity can be conferred on the H(+) -ATPase from Neurospora crassa, a fungus insensitive to fusicoccin. In fact, H+ pumping by purified H(+) -ATPase from Neurospora crassa reconstituted into liposomes containing crude or partially purified fusicoccin receptors <b>from</b> <b>maize</b> was markedly enhanced by fusicoccin. The stimulation of H+ pumping by fusicoccin is dependent upon pH, fusicoccin, and protein concentration, as was reported for the system reconstituted with both proteins <b>from</b> <b>maize...</b>|$|R

40|$|Enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} {{of complex}} wastes {{is a critical}} step for efficient biogas production in anaerobic digesters. Inhibition of this hydrolytic step was studied by addition of humic acid-like (HAL) and fulvic acid-like (FAL) substances, extracted <b>from</b> <b>maize</b> silage and fresh cow manure, to batch tests with cellulose and cellulases from Aspergillus niger and tributyrin and lipases from Candida rugosa. To confirm the inhibition results, microbially catalysed hydrolysis trials were performed, where Fibrobacter succinogenes was grown exclusively on cellulose. Hydrolysis products, as glucose, glycerol and butyric acid, were measured to determine the hydrolysis efficiency and its rate. Cellulose hydrolysis was inhibited by 0. 5 to 5. 0 g l − 1 of HAL and FAL substances extracted <b>from</b> <b>maize</b> and cow manure, which are relevant concentrations for manure and maize digestion.
