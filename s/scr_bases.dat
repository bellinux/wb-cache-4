Materials and Methods: We enrolled 121 patients for whom diagnostic coronary angiography were planned. The risk score for CI-AKI was calculated and serum creatinine (sCr) and CyC were measured before and 48 h post coronary angiography. CyC and <b>sCr</b> <b>based</b> AKI was calculated as a 25 % increase from baseline within 48 h from contrast media exposure. Results: Mean serum CyC and creatinine concentrations were 0. 88 ± 0. 27 mg/dL and 0. 79 ± 0. 22 mg/dL, respectively before the procedure and 1. 07 ± 0. 47 mg/dL and 0. 89 ± 0. 36 mg/dL, respectively 48 h after contrast media exposure (P < 0. 001). CyC based AKI occured in 45 patients (37. 19 %) and <b>sCr</b> <b>based</b> AKI occured in 20 patients (16. 52 %) after the procedure.

40|$|The {{reliable}} {{analysis of}} interval data (coarsened data) {{is one of}} the most promising applications of imprecise probabilities in statistics. If one refrains from making untestable, and often materially unjustified, strong assumptions on the coarsening process, then the empirical distribution of the data is imprecise, and statistical models are, in Manski’s terms, partially identified. We first elaborate some subtle differences between two natural ways of handling interval data in the dependent variable of regression models, distinguishing between two different types of identification regions, called Sharp Marrow Region (SMR) and Sharp Collection Region (SCR) here. Focusing on the case of linear regression analysis, we then derive some fundamental geometrical properties of SMR and SCR, allowing a comparison of the regions and providing some guidelines for their canonical construction. Relying on the algebraic framework of adjunctions of two mappings between partially ordered sets, we characterize SMR as a right adjoint and as the monotone kernel of a criterion function <b>based</b> mapping, while <b>SCR</b> is indeed interpretable as the corresponding monotone hull.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{significant}} progress during {{last couple of}} decades, ESD still affects production yields, manufacturing costs, product quality, product reliability and profitability. The objective of an ESD protection circuit {{is to create a}} harmless shunting path for the static electricity before it damages the sensitive electronic circuits. As the devices are scaling down, while ESD energy remains the same, VLSIs are becoming more vulnerable to ESD stress. This higher susceptibility to ESD damage is due to thinner gate oxides and shallower junctions. Furthermore, higher operating frequency of the scaled technologies enforces lower parasitic capacitance of the ESD protection circuits. Hence, increasing the robustness of the ESD protection circuits with minimum additional parasitic capacitance is the main challenge in state of the art CMOS processes. Furthermore with scaling, the integration of analog blocks such as ADC, PLL’s, DLL’s, oscillator etc. on digital chips has provided cheap system on chip (SOC) solutions. However, when analog and digital chip are combined into single mixed-signal chip, on-chip noise coupling from the digital to the analog circuitry through ESD protection circuits becomes a big concern. Thus, increasing supply noise isolation while ensuring the ESD protection robustness is also a big challenge. In this thesis, several ESD protection circuits and devices have been proposed to address the critical issues like increased leakage current, slower turn-on time of devices, increased susceptibility to power supply isolation etc. The proposed ESD protection circuits/devices have been classified into two categories: Pad based ESD protection in which the ESD protection circuits are placed in the I/O pads, and Rail based ESD in which ESD protection circuit is placed between power supplies. In our research, both these aspects have been investigated. The Silicon Controlled Rectifier (<b>SCR)</b> <b>based</b> devices have been used for Pad ESD protection as they have highest ESD protection level per unit area. Two novel devices Darlington <b>based</b> <b>SCR</b> (DSCR) and NMOS Darlington <b>based</b> <b>SCR</b> (NMOS-DSCR) having faster turn-on time, lower first breakdown voltage and low capacitance have been proposed.

A methodology has been purposed to reduce the leakage current by more than 200, 000 times without having major impact on the ESD performance. Also, the issue of noise coupling from digital supply to analog supply through the ESD protection circuits has been addressed. A new transient clamp has been proposed to increase the power supply noise isolation. Finally, a new methodology of placement of analog circuit with respect to transient clamp has been proposed to further increase the power supply noise isolation...|$|R

We tried to apply association mapping in candidate gene FLC. We have detected a strong association signal at FLC attributable to the very late flowering Swedish accessions. In addition, we also found several geographically restricted clusters of early flowering accessions. Among them, Central Asian accessions were previously shown to carry weak FLC alleles. We also identified eight types of large-size intronic insertions, including the two previously known transposable element insertions found respectively in Ler and Da 1 - 12 that cause the weak function of FLC in these accessions. Likely the other intronic insertions have the same functional effect. This result indicates that many such kind of alleles have evolved independently at different origins.; Seed dormancy is a difficult trait to quantify and pattern of natural variation is largely unknown. Using the requirement for after-ripening, the days of dry storage to reach 50 % germination ratio (DSDS 50), we have successfully phenotyped seed dormancy in this population and found clear evidence of both nonrandom global patterning and micro-geographic variation that relates to local environmental conditions.; The final part of this thesis considers the evolution of selfing in A. thaliana.

The prototype engine was equipped with a low pressure cooled EGR system, two stage turbocharger, high pressure fuel injection system capable of very high injection pressure and DOC+DPF aftertreatment system. Since the Stage IV emission standard sets a 0. 4 g/kWh NOx limit for the steady state test cycle (NRSC), that includes full load operating conditions, the engine must be operated with very high EGR rates (above 30 %) at very high load. As a consequence, the low {{air to fuel ratio}} and the risk of high soot emissions must be handled by means of high fuel injection pressure and proper injection patterns. In this context, the DIPulse multizone predictive combustion model developed by Gamma Technologies was extensively employed to support the engine calibration and the hardware selection processes. After populating the injection rate map starting from a limited set of measurements, the model was then calibrated to simulate the combustion process with extremely high injection pressures and EGR rates, achieving a very good correlation with the experimental data in terms of burn rates, engine performance parameters and NOx emissions.

40|$|Both {{experimental}} study of pilot plant scale cold flow model and pilot plant performance testing were carried out in this research with particular reference to palm shell as a biomass feedstock. The reactor {{was based on the}} concept of compartmented fluidized bed gasifier (CFBG). Sand was used as second fluidizing material. From the cold flow model, the single component (sand) system characteristic fluidization velocities for the gasifier are larger than those observed in the combustor. These differences can be minimized by utilizing larger sand size. The existing correlations are modified for the sand. For the binary mixture, the characteristic fluidization velocities showed the tendency to increase with the increase in the palm shell size and weight percent. The concept of critical loading is introduced to characterize the palm shell content in the binary mixture where the characteristic fluidization velocities for the binary mixture are determined principally by the sand. The critical loading increases with the sand size, but decreases with the increase of palm shell size. The correlations developed for the sand can be used for the binary mixture within the critical loading. Despite of the local variation on the palm shell vertical and lateral distribution, the overall good mixing quality can be established in both the compartments. The overall mixing quality is enhanced with the decrease in the palm shell size and the increase in the palm shell weight percent. Bigger bed diameter also improves the overall mixing quality while bed height did not contribute significantly. Solid circulation rate (SCR) increases with the increase in the bed height while the main bed aeration does not affect the <b>SCR.</b> <b>Based</b> on statistical approach, the V-valve and riser aerations are simultaneously adjusted to determine the optimum SCR.

The {{study was conducted in}} Nyamisati, Rufiji, Tanzania, where parasite prevalence decreased from 65 to 18 % from 1999 and 2010. A single intervention with ITNs was performed in 1999. IgG levels to recombinant P. falciparum antigens (MSP- 119, MSP- 2, MSP- 3, AMA- 1) and An. gambiae salivary protein gSG 6 were measured in children (1 - 16 y) sampled in cross-sectional surveys in 1999 and 2010. SCR and rates of antibody decay were estimated by fitting mathematical models to data from the two cross-sections, assuming three profiles of exposure: (i) stable; (ii) stepwise decrease; or (iii) continuous decrease. Results suggest an average 66 % decrease in malaria transmission intensity and an 89 % reduction in Anopheles exposure. Transmission trends were best described by a stepwise decrease model with a reduction predicted to occur shortly after distribution of ITNs. The new models provide estimates of the duration of antibody responses under this transmission decline. MSP- 119 seropositive individuals were estimated to convert to seronegative with a half-life of 12 (95 % CI 7 - 20) years due to antibody decline with a half-life of 3 (95 % CI 2 - 6) years.

50|$|MOD {{calculations}} for <b>SCRs</b> {{are usually}} <b>based</b> on the MOD {{for the full}} strength supply gas, as this can then be used for bailout at the full planned dive depth, and is the worst case estimate for the toxicity of the loop gas. MOD calculations can also be done for loop gas as calculated, but this is subject to variations which are not always accurately predictable. Loop gas calculated values for passive addition systems could possibly be used for working MOD calculation, and supply gas for emergency MOD given the relatively stable loop fraction in the passive addition systems, however the loop gas concentration may be closer to full strength if the diver works hard and ventilation increases beyond the linear extraction ratio.|$|R
40|$|We report Cu nuclear-quadrupole-resonance (NQR) results under {{pressure}} (P) on a homogeneous CeCu 2 Si 2 (Tc = 0. 65 K) that revealed critical magnetic fluctuations {{at the border}} to an antiferromagnetic (AF) phase. This exotic superconducting (SC) phase evolves into the typical heavy-fermion SC phase at minute pressures exceeding Pc ∼ 0. 2 GPa. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation data in a P range 0. 85 – 2. 58 GPa are shown to be accountable by the <b>SCR</b> theory <b>based</b> on the nearly AF Fermi-liquid model. In 0 ≤ P < Pc ∼ 0. 2 GPa, by contrast, we conclude that the exotic SC phase manifests itself under the unconventional normal state where AF waves propagate over a long range without any trace of AF order and thereby the heavy-fermion state breaks up. There is increasing evidence that a superconducting (SC) phase in cerium-based heavy-fermion (HF) compounds takes place on the border at which an antiferromagnetic (AF) order is suppressed by applying pressure (P) to the AF-HF compounds CeCu 2 Ge 2 [1], CePd 2 Si 2 [2] and CeIn 3 [3]. When a magnetic medium is near the AF phase, AF waves tend to propagate over a long range with low characteristic energy. Thereb...|$|R

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} exhaust {{aftertreatment}} technologies, {{and the costs}} thereof, required to achieve future emissions legislation. Firstly, a brief summary {{of the types of}} systems is addressed with a cost of implementation implicitly attached to each system of choice. The three major routes considered to meet the various legislated limits are: a diesel particulate filter coupled with EGR (exhaust gas recirculation), a selective catalytic reduction (<b>SCR)</b> system <b>based</b> on urea, and a combination of both a filter and SCR. The systems are reviewed with an emphasis on emissions reduction potential as well as possible diesel fuel savings where applicable. Secondly, the cost implications of using a secondary, water-based fuel (urea) on board diesel vehicles as a basis for NOx reduction via a simple discounted cash flow methodology are explored. By utilising the methodology described, various parameters such as fuel costs (both diesel and urea), annual mileage, fuel economy, and system cost can be varied and examined in detail. The ‘system’ costs are calculated throughout the vehicle life, within a practical framework, in order to assess the feasibility of implementing these advanced aftertreatment systems in the future. Other issues that are briefly considered include quantities of urea predicted {{to meet the needs of}} the systems, urea fuel storage and delivery aspects, and potential increase in urea production...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to implement and evaluate the Empower Youth Program—a holistic, peer support, and education intervention aimed at enabling middle school–aged adolescents to take greater control over their health through improving self-care resources (<b>SCR).</b> Empower is <b>based</b> on the Mind, Body, Spirit Program developed by Rodgers and colleagues and tested on adults. An experimental pretest and posttest design was used to compare out-comes for two randomly assigned groups. Forty middle school participants completed measures of academic and emotional SCR before and after the 9 -week intervention. It was hypothesized that after controlling for strength of preexisting SCR, participants who received the intervention would show greater improvement in self-reports after completing the program compared to participants receiving usual school services. The differences in scores between groups are clinically meaningful but not statistically significant. Future studies with larger samples may be able to detect significant contributions of the Empower program...|$|R
40|$|Electrostatic {{discharge}} (ESD) {{failure is}} a major reliability problem to integrated circuits (IC). On-chip ESD protection is mandatory for all IC chips to protect against any possible ESD damages. Therefore, Whole-chip ESD protection circuit simulation is essential to chip-level ESD protection design synthesis, optimization, verification and prediction. Today, trial-and-error approaches still dominate in practical ESD circuit designs {{due to lack of}} full-chip ESD simulation tools and accurate ESD device modeling technique. This thesis reports a new chip-level ESD CAD tool, which can accurately extract ESD devices from layout files, generate an ESD netlist, simulate ESD discharge function at chip level and conduct full-chip ESD zapping test simulation. This CAD tool is designed with several unique algorithms and a smart ESD parametric checking mechanism, which takes full consideration of ESD protection operation principles. Therefore, this new CAD tool is different from existing simple ESD spacing and bus resistance checking approaches, and can achieve whole-chip ESD protection verification and prediction. The CAD tool consists of three modules: an ESD device extraction module, an ESD design inspection module and an ESD zapping test module. The ESD extraction module can accurately extract arbitrary ESD protection structures at full chip level. Decomposed-based subgraph isomorphism algorithm is used for ESD device extraction to improve time efficiency. The ESD design inspection module serves to remove non-critical ESD devices extracted based upon a novel smart parametric checking mechanism. The ESD zapping test module is developed to perform complex ESD protection zapping test simulation using Dijkstra's algorithm to resolve the problem of finding the critical ESD discharging path at chip level. The new ESD CAD tool was verified at full chip level using ESD protection designs implemented in 0. 35 µm BiCMOS technology. ESD device models were reported for traditional diode and MOSFET type ESD structures. However, due to complex ESD behaviors, particularly the electro-thermal-process-device-circuit-layout coupling effects, the existing ESD models have limited accuracy in describing complex ESD physics and coupling effects, such as thermal boundary condition and snapback I-V behavior. This thesis presents a new scalable ESD behavioral modeling technique, which uses Verilog-A to develop accurate ESD behavior models for various ESD protection structures, such as novel nano crossbar ESD protection structures, novel 3 D field-programmable ESD protection structures using SONOS and NCD ESD devices, silicon controlled rectifier (<b>SCR)</b> <b>based</b> ESD protection structures, HV diode and SCR ESD protection structures, 28 nm CMOS gated diode and DTSCR ESD protection structures. The new scalable ESD behavior modeling technique was fully verified by SPICE circuit simulation and transmission line pulse (TLP) ESD testing, which will enable whole-chip ESD circuit design optimization and verification. Flip chip technique using ball grid ball (BGA) pad-ring arrays is a popular technology for small footprint chips used in size-sensitive electronics. However, ESD protection design for ICs using large BGA pad-ring array is an emerging challenge since where to place an ESD structure becomes a real layout design problem. This thesis reports design of a BGA pad-ring array with different ESD metal routing for a visible light communication (VLC) transceiver implemented in 180 nm BCD technology at whole-chip level. The ESD structures and their ESD-critical parameters, and the ESD metal bus resistance were extracted by our ESD Extractor CAD tool. The new ESD behavior modeling technique was used to model the ESD structures. The extraction and modeling was validated by SPICE simulation and TLP testing for different ESD metal routing...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} modeling, {{simulation}} {{and implementation of}} Load Commutated <b>SCR</b> <b>based</b> current source Inverter (LCI) fed squirrel cage induction motor drive with sinusoidal voltage and sinusoidal current. In the proposed system, the induction motor is fed by an LCI. A three level diode clamped voltage source inverter (VSI) is connected at the motor terminal with ac chokes connected in series with it. The VSI currents are controlled {{in such a manner}} that it injects the reactive current demanded by the induction motor and the LCI for successful commutation of the SCRs in the LCI. Additionally, it absorbs the harmonic frequency currents to ensure that the induction motor draws sinusoidal current. As a result, the nature of the motor terminal voltage is also sinusoidal. The concept of load commutation of the SCRs in the LCI feeding an induction motor load is explained with necessary waveforms and phasor diagrams. The necessity of reactive compensation by the active filter connected at the motor terminal for the load commutation of the thyristors, is elaborated with the help of analytical equations and phasor diagrams. The requirement of harmonic compensation by the same active filter to achieve sinusoidal motor current and motor voltage, is also described. Finally, to achieve the aforementioned induction motor drive, the VA ratings of the active filter (VSI) and the CSI with respect to VA rating of the motor, are determined theoretically. The proposed drive scheme is simulated under idealized condition. Simulation results show good steady state and dynamic response of the drive system. Load commutation of the SCRs in the LCI and the sinusoidal profile of motor current and voltage, have been demonstrated. As in LCI fed synchronous motor drives, a special mode of operation is required to run up the induction motor from standstill. As the SCRs of the LCI are load commutated, they need motor terminal voltages for commutation. At standstill these voltages are zero. So, a starting strategy has been proposed and adopted to start the motor with the aid of the current controlled VSI to accelerate until the motor terminal voltages are high enough for the commutation of the SCRs in the LCI. The proposed drive is implemented on an experimental setup in the laboratory. The IGBT based three level diode clamped VSI has been fabricated following the design of the standard module in the laboratory. A generalized digital control platform is also developed using a TMS 320 F 2407 A DSP. Two, three phase thyristor bridges with necessary firing pulse circuits have been used as the phase controlled rectifier and the LCI respectively. Appropriate protection scheme for such a drive is developed and adopted to operate the drive. Relevant experimental results are presented. They are observed to be in good agreement with the simulation results. The effect of capacitors connected at the output of the LCI in the commutation process of the SCRs in the LCI is studied and analyzed. From the analysis, it is understood that the capacitors form a parallel resonating pair with filter inductor and the motor leakage inductance, which results in an undesired oscillation in the terminal voltage during each of the commutation intervals leading to commutation failure. So, in the final system, the capacitors are removed to eliminate any chance of commutation failure of the SCRs in the LCI. It is shown by experiment that the commutation of the SCRs takes place reliably {{in the absence of the}} capacitors also. The commutation process is studied and analyzed without the capacitors to understand the motor terminal voltage waveform of the experimental results...|$|R
