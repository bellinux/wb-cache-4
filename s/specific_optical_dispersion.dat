40|$|Music can {{be viewed}} as a {{structure}} formed by notes. Different structures in music have potential to yield enormously rich diversity of different melodies. Music is a typical example where a structure defines a property. Similar concepts could be also exploited in education, in presented case in nano-sciences, which are typical representatives of soft materials the structure of which can be strongly manipulated with local geometry and presence of appropriate nanoparticles. The objects of study, named also LC shells, will be exploited as basic unit elements for future soft colloidal crystals. A different arrangement of colloids within the crystal would result in different physical properties in a similar way as different packing of atoms results in different crystals made of real atoms. In presented research will be demonstrated, how relevant basic mechanisms in thin films of nematic liquid crystals could be explained in a classroom and used as a case study, also for explanation of many other physical properties. This research topic is still in its infancy. At this stage only various defect structures in relatively simple geometries (spherical and elliptical) will be analyzed. There is a need to find simple ways to control sensitively the valence of LC shells and in particular to develop strategies to assemble them in crystal structures of desired symmetry. This would allow tailoring <b>specific</b> <b>optical</b> <b>dispersion</b> relations or other physical property of interest and make new ways to teach different physical properties on the "music" based approach...|$|E

40|$|Chalcogenide glass {{development}} {{continues to}} be the source of intense study by research groups around the world. Their physical properties, including broadband infrared transparency, high refractive index, low glass transition temperature, and nonlinear properties, make chalcogenide materials attractive candidates for advanced mid-infrared (3 to 12 µm) optical designs. Efforts focused at developing new chalcogenide glass formulations and processing methods require rapid quantitative evaluation of their optical constants to guide the materials research. However, characterization of important optical parameters such as <b>optical</b> <b>dispersion</b> and thermal index variations (dn/dT) remains a slow and costly process, generally with limited accuracy. The recent development of a prism coupler at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) now enables rapid, high precision measurement Clf refractive indices at discrete wavelengths from the visible to the mid-infrared. <b>Optical</b> <b>dispersion</b> data of several chalcogenide glass families were collected using this method. Variations in the <b>optical</b> <b>dispersion</b> were correlated to glass composition and then compared against minimum deviation measurements.

40|$|The {{common and}} {{traditional}} method for <b>dispersion</b> compensation in <b>optical</b> domain is concatenating the transmit optical fiber by a compensating optical fiber having high-negative dispersion coefficient. In this paper, we take an opposite direction and show how an optical fiber with high-positive dispersion coefficient {{can also be}} used for <b>dispersion</b> compensation. Our <b>optical</b> <b>dispersion</b> compensating structure is the optical implementation of an iterative algorithm in signal processing. The proposed dispersion compensating system is constructed by cascading a number of compensating sub-systems and its compensation capability is improved by increasing the number of embedded sub-systems. We also show that the compensation capability is a trade-off between transmission length and bandwidth. We use simulation results to validate the performance of the introduced dispersion compensating module.

40|$|Inelastic {{scattering}} {{processes such as}} Brillouin scattering {{can often}} function in cascaded regimes and {{this is likely to}} occur in certain integrated opto-acoustic devices. We develop a Hamiltonian formalism for cascaded Brillouin scattering valid for both quantum and classical regimes. By regarding Brillouin scattering as the interaction of a single acoustic envelope and a single optical envelope that covers all Stokes and anti-Stokes orders, we obtain a compact model that is well suited for numerical implementation, extension to include other optical nonlinearities or short pulses, and application in the quantum-optics domain. We then theoretically analyze intra-mode forward Brillouin scattering (FBS) for arbitrary waveguides with and without <b>optical</b> <b>dispersion.</b> In the absence of <b>optical</b> <b>dispersion,</b> we find an exact analytical solution. With a perturbative approach, we furthermore solve the case of weak <b>optical</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Our work leads to several key results on intra-mode FBS. For negligible dispersion, we show that cascaded intra-mode FBS results in a pure phase modulation and discuss how this necessitates specific experimental methods for the observation of fibre-based and integrated FBS. Further, we discuss how the descriptions that have been established in these two classes of waveguides connect {{to each other and to}} the broader context of cavity opto-mechanics and Raman scattering. Finally, we draw an unexpected striking similarity between FBS and discrete diffraction phenomena in waveguide arrays, which makes FBS an interesting candidate for future research in quantum-optics.

40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>dispersion</b> spectra at {{energies}} up to 30 eV play a {{vital role}} in understanding the chirality-dependent van der Waals London dispersion interactions of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). We use one-electron theory based calculations to obtain the band structures and the frequency dependent dielectric response function from 0 - 30 eV for 64 SWCNTs differing in radius, electronic structure classification, and geometry. The resulting <b>optical</b> <b>dispersion</b> properties can be categorized over three distinct energy intervals (M, pi, and sigma, respectively representing 0 - 0. 1, 0. 1 - 5, and 5 - 30 eV regions) and over radii above or below the zone-folding limit of 0. 7 nm. While pi peaks vary systematically with radius for a given electronic structure type, peaks are independent of tube radius above the zone folding limit and depend entirely on SWCNT geometry. Based on these calculated one-electron dielectric response functions we compute and review Van derWaals - London dispersion spectra, full spectral Hamaker coefficients, and van derWaals - London dispersion interaction energies for all calculated frequency dependent dielectric response functions. Our results are categorized using a new optical dielectric function classification scheme that groups the nanotubes according to observable trends and notable features (e. g. the metal paradox) in the 0 - 30 eV part of the <b>optical</b> <b>dispersion</b> spectra. While the trends in these spectra begin to break down at the zone folding diameter limit, the trends in the related van derWaals - London dispersion spectra tend to remain stable all the way down to the smallest single wall carbon nanotubes in a given class...|$|R

An orthogonal polarization pair can have large disparity of eye-closure penalty despite an identical DOP. We also demonstrate a novel approach to estimate the maximum eye-closure penalty asymmetry with three orthogonal polarizations on the Poincaré sphere.
