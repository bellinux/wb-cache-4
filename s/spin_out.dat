5|$|Consecutive points {{finishes}} in Hungary and Italy saw Webber climb to ninth in the drivers' standings with a 5-point margin over Button. He {{was unable to}} hold on to this position however, after one too many laps on dry tyres saw him <b>spin</b> <b>out</b> from the lead of the , and a disappointing 11th-place result in Japan. These meant that he had finished on equal points with Button but lost out on a countback.|$|E
5|$|He {{served in}} the Clay Center Kansas National Guard and in that {{capacity}} was called to assist in crowd safety {{at one of the}} popular flying demonstrations in Topeka in June 1910. Longren's interest in aircraft was ignited after he witnessed the featured airplane <b>spin</b> <b>out</b> shortly after takeoff and crash to the ground. The 28-year-old tinkerer immediately set upon building his own improved version of a flying machine.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins in}} medias res with Walker, Adams, and Lugo flying in a {{helicopter}} past the skyscrapers of Dubai, shooting down several pursuing helicopters until a sudden sandstorm forms, causing one of the pursuers to <b>spin</b> <b>out</b> of control and crash into the trio. The story then jumps back to the start, with Delta traversing the storm wall {{to the outskirts of}} a mostly buried Dubai, being taunted on broadcasts by the Radioman (Jake Busey), a DJ and former journalist speaking for the 33rd. After coming across refugees being rounded up by the 33rd and engaging in a firefight, Walker elects to disobey orders and find Konrad.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} {{practice}} session on Friday afternoon, Ferrari {{was able to}} reduce the gap to Mercedes, with Vettel third {{a little more than}} seven-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. Nico Rosberg was just 0.021 seconds off his teammate's time of 1m24.279s, even leading through the first two sectors but losing fastest time through the third and final sector. The two Force India cars of Sergio Pérez and Nico Hülkenberg split the two Ferrari drivers, with Kimi Räikkönen finishing in sixth. Max Verstappen was the second Toro Rosso driver of the day to <b>spin</b> <b>out</b> into the gravel, but he was able to continue after losing control of his car at the Ascari chicane. There were technical problems for both Daniel Ricciardo and Jenson Button. While the Australian had to cut his first run short due to a hydraulical issue, Button was summoned back into the pit lane after only three laps with an unspecified problem.|$|E
5|$|The Griffins, the Swansons, and Quagmire {{prepare for}} a road trip, ostensibly for a {{vacation}} in Maine. Quagmire distracts Bonnie and Lois as Peter alters course to Virginia instead. The group arrives at a bar in Stoolbend, Virginia, and discover that it was Cleveland who told the bartender the joke. Peter asks Cleveland where he first heard the joke, and Cleveland reveals that a Washington, D.C., bellhop named Sal Russo told it to him. The group sets out for D.C. with Cleveland in tow. They are attacked by a black car, whose occupants fire guns at them {{to prevent them from}} learning the joke's origin. Joe shoots out one of the car's tires, causing it to <b>spin</b> <b>out</b> of control and flip onto its roof. The Quahog group arrive at a Washington hotel and locate Sal, who is reluctant to reveal the source of the joke. He races away on a handcart through Washington. Losing track of Sal, they are soon captured by several men in black suits who pistol-whip them until they are unconscious.|$|E

25|$|While driving, {{the player}} {{collects}} power-ups from item boxes placed in various {{points on the}} track. These power-ups allow the player to attack opponents, causing them to slow down or <b>spin</b> <b>out</b> of control; defend against such attacks; or gain boosts in speed. These include the series staple items, such as the Mushroom, Koopa shell projectiles, the Starman, and banana peels. There are also new items such as the Mega Mushroom, which temporally grows the player to an enormous size and allows them to flatten opposing karts.|$|E
25|$|Stuxnet is a {{computer}} worm discovered in June 2010 that {{is believed to have}} been created by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. It switched off safety devices, causing centrifuges to <b>spin</b> <b>out</b> of control. Stuxnet initially spreads via Microsoft Windows, and targets Siemens industrial control systems. While it is not the first time that hackers have targeted industrial systems, it is the first discovered malware that spies on and subverts industrial systems, and the first to include a programmable logic controller (PLC) rootkit.|$|E
25|$|The work {{teams were}} hastily {{dispatched}} {{and had a}} poor understanding of student sentiment. Unlike the political movement of the 1950s that squarely targeted intellectuals, the new movement was focused on established party cadres, {{many of whom were}} part of the work teams. As a result, the work teams came under increasing suspicion for being yet another group aimed at thwarting revolutionary fervour. The party leadership subsequently became divided over whether or not work teams should remain in place. Liu Shaoqi insisted on continuing work-team involvement and suppressing the movement's most radical elements, fearing that the movement would <b>spin</b> <b>out</b> of control.|$|E

25|$|Plans to <b>spin</b> <b>out</b> Zoetis, the Agriculture Division of Pfizer {{and later}} Pfizer Animal Health, were {{announced}} in 2012. Pfizer filed for registration of a Class A stock with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 13, 2012. Zoetis's IPO on February 1, 2013, sold 86.1million shares for US$2.2billion. Pfizer retained 414million Class B shares, giving it an 83% controlling {{stake in the}} firm. The offering's lead underwriters were JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley. Most of the money raised through the IPO was used to pay off existing Pfizer debt.|$|E

25|$|The 1988 season saw Earnhardt racing {{with a new}} sponsor, GM Goodwrench, after Wrangler Jeans {{dropped its}} {{sponsorship}} in 1987. During this season, he changed {{the color of his}} paint scheme from blue and yellow to black, in which the No. 3 car was painted. He won three races in 1988, finishing third in the points standings behind Bill Elliott in first and Rusty Wallace in second. The following year, Earnhardt won five races, but a late <b>spin</b> <b>out</b> at North Wilkesboro arguably cost him the 1989 championship, as Rusty Wallace edged him out for it. It was his first season for the GM Goodwrench Chevrolet Lumina.|$|E

25|$|The {{crowd at}} the funeral boiled over, {{throwing}} dry branches, furniture, and even clothing on to Caesar's funeral pyre, causing the flames to <b>spin</b> <b>out</b> of control, seriously damaging the Forum. The mob then attacked the houses of Brutus and Cassius, where they were repelled only with considerable difficulty, ultimately providing the spark for the civil war, fulfilling {{at least in part}} Antony's threat against the aristocrats. Antony did not foresee the ultimate outcome of the next series of civil wars, particularly with regard to Caesar's adopted heir. Octavian, aged only 18 when Caesar died, proved to have considerable political skills, and while Antony dealt with Decimus Brutus {{in the first round of}} the new civil wars, Octavian consolidated his tenuous position.|$|E
25|$|The PIT {{begins when}} the {{pursuing}} vehicle pulls alongside the fleeing vehicle {{so that the}} portion of the pursuer's vehicle forward of the front wheels is aligned with {{the portion of the}} target vehicle behind the back wheels. The pursuer gently makes contact with the target's side, then steers sharply into the target. The pursuer must also accelerate or its bumper will slide off of the target vehicle. As soon as the fleeing vehicle's rear tires lose traction and start to skid, the pursuer continues to turn in the same direction until clear of the target. This is more of a committed lane change than an actual turn. The target will turn in the opposite direction, in front of the pursuer, and will <b>spin</b> <b>out.</b> The PIT may be done from either side, but consideration must be given to where both cars will end up.|$|E
25|$|Afraid {{that the}} {{movement}} would now <b>spin</b> <b>out</b> of control, Deng Xiaoping asked that the Square be cleared for the Gorbachev visit. Executing Deng's request, Zhao used a soft approach, and directed his subordinates to coordinate negotiations with students immediately. Zhao believed he could appeal to the students' patriotism, and that the students understood signs of internal turmoil during the Sino-Soviet summit would embarrass the nation (not just the government). On the morning of 13 May, Yan Mingfu, head of the Communist Party's United Front, called an emergency meeting, gathering prominent student leaders and intellectuals, including Liu Xiaobo, Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao. Yan said the government was prepared to hold immediate dialogue with student representatives, but that the Tiananmen welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev would be cancelled whether the students withdraw or not—in effect removing the bargaining power the students thought they possessed. The announcement sent the student leadership into disarray.|$|E
