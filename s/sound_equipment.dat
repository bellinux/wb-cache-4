Dreyer did the audio work at Universum Film AG, as they had the best <b>sound</b> <b>equipment</b> {{available}} {{to him at the}} time. Most of the actors did not dub their own voices. The only voices of the actors that are their own in the film are of Schmitz and Gunzburg. The sounds of dogs, parrots, and other animals in the film were fake and were done by professional imitators. Wolfgang Zeller composed the film's score and worked with Dreyer to develop the music.|$|E

5|$|Sennheiser <b>sound</b> <b>equipment</b> {{was used}} for the audio. According to Matt Napier, Madonna's monitor engineer, they used Sennheiser's Wireless Systems Manager {{software}} to tweak frequencies. Madonna used an HSP 4 headset {{at the beginning of the}} show, later switching to a Sennheiser SKM 5200-II handheld transmitter. Sennheiser transmitters were also used by Minaj, M.I.A. and LMFAO, and Green's microphone used an MD 5235 capsule. Napier said in a Mix article that they needed gold-plated transmitters for Madonna and Green, which were provided by Sennheiser the day of the show. Professional Wireless Systems (PWS), a Masque Sound company, were in charge of wireless sound monitoring; in a series of trial runs, PWS chose a frequency that eliminated interference from other systems.|$|E
5|$|Preparations {{began in}} January, with Madonna {{saying that the}} {{rehearsal}} was the most exhausting one {{in which she had}} ever participated. Costumes were designed by Riccardo Tisci, Givenchy, Miu Miu and Prada. The performance required 500 outfits, including customized costumes for the musical guests and assisting performers. The production team was allotted seven minutes to set up the stage, 12 minutes for the performance and eight minutes to take down the stage. The modular structure was assembled from a truck, with a large white fabric in front as media screens for Moment Factory. Projection mapping was used by video-hardware manufacturer Barco, with films modified for the spectators and the television audience. The stadium was equipped with Sharpys lighting arrangements from Clay Paky, and the show used Sennheiser <b>sound</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Months went {{by without}} any {{scheduled}} concerts {{due to the}} album's poor sales. Following another relapse and a stint in rehab, Kiedis {{and the rest of}} the band prepared for a summer tour, their first in almost seven months. Before the tour could begin, Kiedis had an accident on his motorcycle and was rushed to the hospital after severely injuring his hand. Due to his drug addiction, it took seven doses of morphine before the pain was assuaged. Following discharge from the hospital, he was forced to wear a full-arm cast for several months, resulting in the cancellation of all remaining scheduled concerts. Halfway through Kiedis's recovery, the band was asked to play the Fuji Rock Festival in July 1997. By that time, Kiedis's cast had receded down to the elbow and he felt well enough to play. A large typhoon had been forecast to hit the festival several hours before the show. The concert took place anyway, and when the Chili Peppers got on stage to play, the audience was being soaked in torrential rains, and the band found it virtually impossible to play their instruments. After eight songs, the lighting and <b>sound</b> <b>equipment</b> was torn from the stage and the band was obliged to an impromptu finish.|$|E

5|$|The group's Red Rocks {{concert was}} {{scheduled}} for 5 June 1983, but poor weather that day threatened to cancel the show. Torrential rain soaked the area, and flash flood warnings were issued. The weather {{made it difficult for}} the crew members to transport the band's gear and video equipment through the mountains to the amphitheatre. The conditions also caused many technical problems for the filming and concert crews, which hampered stage construction and endangered the safety of those setting up lighting and <b>sound</b> <b>equipment.</b> Crew members used squeegees to keep rain away from the wires, although the assistant of recording engineer Randy Ezratty still received an electrical shock while setting up a lighting truss. The fans that attended had to hike through the Rocky Mountains in the rain. Between 15 and 20 fans were already camped out in the venue's front rows early in the morning, and lead singer Bono accommodated them by serving coffee and tea. The Alarm and Divinyls cancelled their opening sets for safety reasons, and many fans thought the entire concert had been cancelled. The show {{was scheduled for}} 6:00pm, and the band had until 1:00pm to decide whether to move the concert elsewhere or risk the weather worsening, which could have necessitated a cancellation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sound</b> <b>equipment</b> was {{provided}} by Showco who used the PRISM system, which adapted the show for each venue according to its height, width and the coverage required. The sound was mixed by Front of house engineer Monty Lee Wilkes {{on a combination of}} Yamaha PM4000 and PM3000 consoles, an unusual choice for Spears's shows. He used dbx 903 compressors for kick and snare drums. The compressors were also used on Spears's microphones, a Shure Beta 58A handheld and a Crown CM-311AE headset-mounted capsule. Spears's vocals were mostly live—pre-recorded vocals ran in parallel on an ADAT machine during the shows, and were used to replace her live microphone when the dance routines became too energetic for good voice control. Spears's band, backline technicians and monitor engineer Raza Sufi were all fitted with in-ear monitors and headset mics, enabling rapid and clear communications around the stage area. Spears did not use them, preferring the ambient sound of a battery of eight Showco SRM wedges spread across the downstage area. These were augmented by Showco SS full-range sidefills and a pair of one-by-18-inch subs {{on each side of the}} stage. Sufi also used a dbx 160A to limit Spears's louder moments, while backing vocalists were controlled by a duo of BSS DPR901 dynamic equalizers. Effects were limited to vocal and drum reverbs. Amplification for the wedges and the FOH system were all Crown-based, with a pair of drum stool shakers completing the line-up. All the cables used during the tour were brought from the US, even in Europe, something unusual in audio production.|$|E

25|$|If {{the voltage}} across the {{photoresistor}} does {{not exceed the}} threshold, which varies between 100 and 300 mV depending on the material, then the coefficient of nonlinear distortions has a value within 0.01%, which is almost independent of the voltage. These distortions are dominated by the second harmonic. Above the voltage threshold, the third harmonic appears, and the amplitude of the distortions increases as {{the square of the}} voltage. For a distortion of 0.1% (−80dB), which is acceptable for high-fidelity <b>sound</b> <b>equipment,</b> the signal voltage should be within 500 mV. The ratio of even and odd harmonics can be controlled by applying a DC bias to the photoresistor.|$|E

25|$|The {{output of}} a given {{microphone}} delivers the same power whether it is low or high impedance. If a microphone is made in high and low impedance versions, the high impedance version has a higher output voltage for a given sound pressure input, and is suitable for use with vacuum-tube guitar amplifiers, for instance, which have a high input impedance and require a relatively high signal input voltage to overcome the tubes' inherent noise. Most professional microphones are low impedance, about 200Ω or lower. Professional vacuum-tube <b>sound</b> <b>equipment</b> incorporates a transformer that steps up the impedance of the microphone circuit to the high impedance and voltage needed to drive the input tube. External matching transformers are also available {{that can be used}} in-line between a low impedance microphone and a high impedance input.|$|E

25|$|In 1967 Vactec {{introduced}} a compact RO branded as Vactrol. Unlike the tube-coupled ROs of Fender and Gibson, Vactrols were sealed and sturdy devices. In the early 1970s, Vactec replaced incandescent bulbs by LEDs. This increased the switching speed, {{but not to}} the level required for digital devices. Therefore, the introduction of the faster photodiodes and phototransistors in the 1970s pushed out ROs from the market. ROs retained narrow application niches in <b>sound</b> <b>equipment</b> and some industrial automation devices that did not require high speeds. Vactec did not extend their rights to the trademark Vactrol, and it has become a household word in the English language for any RO used in audio equipment, including the ROs of Fender and Gibson. As of 2012, the Vactrol ROs were produced by PerkinElmer, the successor Vactec.|$|E
25|$|Ventriloquism {{has been}} used as the {{evidence}} for the modality appropriateness hypothesis. Ventriloquism describes the situation in which auditory location perception is shifted toward a visual cue. The original study describing this phenomenon was conducted by Howard and Templeton, (1966) after which several studies have replicated and built upon the conclusions they reached. In conditions in which the visual cue is unambiguous, visual capture reliably occurs. Thus to test the influence of sound on perceived location, the visual stimulus must be progressively degraded. Furthermore, given that auditory stimuli are more attuned to temporal changes, recent studies have tested the ability of temporal characteristics to influence the spatial location of visual stimuli. Some types of EVP – electronic voice phenomenon, mainly the ones using sound bubles are considered a kind of modern ventriloquism technique and is played by the use of sophisticated software, computers and <b>sound</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Though Crosby {{did want}} {{more time to}} tend to his other {{business}} and leisure activities, he also sought better quality through recording, including being able to eliminate mistakes and control the timing of his show performances.

He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name Minute Maid. This investment allowed Crosby to make more money by finding a loophole whereby the IRS couldn't tax him at a 77% rate.|$|E
