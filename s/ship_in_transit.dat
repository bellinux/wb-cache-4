50|$|William James Kirkpatrick (February 27, 1838 - September 20, 1921) {{was born}} in the Parish of Errigal, Keerogue, County Tyrone, Ireland to a schoolteacher and musician, Thomas Kirkpatrick and his wife, Elizabeth Storey. The family immigrated to Philadelphia on August 5, 1840, living first in Duncannon, PA. William did not {{accompany}} his parents on the initial immigration as he was too young and they wished to be settled before bringing him to America. They did, however, give birth to a daughter on the <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit.</b> William was exposed to and given formal training in music at a very young age. In 1854, he moved to Philadelphia to study music and carpentry. It was here that he studied vocal music under Professor T. Bishop. Kirkpatrick was a versatile musician playing the cello, fife, flute, organ, and violin. He joined the Harmonia and the Haydn Sacred Music Societies where he was exposed to many great composers. In 1855, he became involved in the Wharton Street Methodist Episcopal Church serving the choir with his musical talent and teaching Sunday school.|$|E

40|$|Concentration {{data for}} organic {{contaminants}} {{in remote areas}} are scarce, particularly for open ocean systems. These data are much needed for the global fate assessment of these compounds, both for water and air. The traditional methods for determining these concentrations, such as high-volume air and water sampling with polyurethane foam or XAD are labour-intensive and – {{in the case of}} batch water sampling – require much station time at sea, which makes these methods costly as well. Passive sampling methods like semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs, [Huckins et al., 1990] and [Huckins et al., 2006]) have been used {{as an alternative to the}} high-volume extraction methods in air ([Ockenden et al., 1998], [Lohmann et al., 2001] and [Meijer et al., 2003]) and in water (Crunkilton and DeVita, 1997 R. L. Crunkilton and W. M. DeVita, Determination of aqueous concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in an urban stream, Chemosphere 35 (1997), pp. 1447 – 1463. Article | PDF (739 K) | View Record in Scopus | Cited By in Scopus (23) [Crunkilton and DeVita, 1997], [Luellen and Shea, 2002] and [Verweij et al., 2004]). A ship-based deployment of these samplers during transit time could yield valuable concentration data with little effort and at low cost. However, the sampling rates of SPMDs are in the range 1 – 20 m 3 d− 1 for air, and 1 – 200 L d− 1 for water, depending on the physicochemical properties of the analytes and on the exposure temperature and flow velocity (Huckins et al., 2006). The very low concentrations in open ocean systems combined with potentially low sampling rates could result in detectability problems. The detectability could be improved by extending the exposure time, albeit with a loss of spatial resolution in the case of a <b>ship</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit.</b> To assess the merits of ship-based organic contaminant monitoring with passive samplers, we did a pilot study on board the RV Pelagia, in its transit from the island of Texel (The Netherlands) to Walvis Bay (Namibia) and Cape Town (South Africa), targeting polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 1, 1 -dichloro- 2, 2 -bis(4 -chlorophenyl) ethene (4, 4 ′-DDE), and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) ...|$|E

50|$|Until the Panama Canal {{opened in}} 1914, the Strait of Magellan {{was the main}} route for steamships {{traveling}} from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific.

40|$|Screening {{methods to}} prevent {{introductions}} of invasive species {{are critical for}} the protection of environmental and economic benefits provided by native species and uninvaded ecosystems. Coastal ecosystems worldwide remain vulnerable to damage from aquatic species introductions, particularly via ballast water discharge from ships. Because current ballast management practices are not completely effective, rapid and sensitive screening methods are needed for on-site testing of <b>ships</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit.</b> Here, we describe a detection technology based on a microfluidic chip containing DNA oligonucleotide functionalized carbon nanotubes. We demonstrate the efficacy of the chip using three ballast-transported species either established (Dreissena bugensis) or of potential threat (Eriocheir sinensis and Limnoperna fortuneii) to the Laurentian Great Lakes. With further refinement for on-board application, the technology could lead to real-time ballast water screening to improve ship-specific management and control decisions...|$|R

Several {{state of the}} art CNN models are presented and trained on data sets with relevance to the above-mentioned objective. Data collected from different sources are used for training these CNN models in pursuit to obtain a good performing detector. The main data sets are large, general purpose image sets of ships and boats. A smaller image set is also developed in this thesis. This custom data set is constructed from images taken along a predefined path at sea from a video camera. This includes images along docks and of <b>ships</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> at sea.

50|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939 Halifax Shipyard, located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was distant from the major industrial centre of Canada.

Further, from 1940 {{until the end of}} the war the limited, albeit increasing, technical facilities and skilled labour force available to Halifax Shipyard were necessarily concentrated upon repair and refit of <b>ships</b> damaged <b>in</b> innumerable Atlantic convoys departing from Bedford Basin. Thus, competition for such limited resources as were available was intense.

40|$|Transit {{shipping}} {{through the}} Arctic via the Northern Sea Route, {{along the northern}} coast of Scandinavia and Russia, is already occurring. In addition, Arctic oil/ gas extraction is being explored due to large oil and gas reserves under the Arctic Ocean. In the future, development of these anthropogenic activities will increase emissions of air pollutants (aerosols, ozone, and their precursors) into the Arctic lower troposphere. Even at mid-latitudes, emissions from oil/gas activities and shipping have large uncertainties, making future projections of Arctic shipping emissions even more diffi cult. As part of the EU ACCESS project, an aircraft campaign was conducted in July 2012 to study shipping and oil/gas extraction emissions based in Andøya, Norway. The campaign focused on studying <b>ships</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> from Murmansk, Russia {{off the coast of}} Norway and oil/gas platforms in the Norwegian Sea. The main focus of the campaign measurements was to investigate the role of current and future anthropogenic activities in and near the Arctic on regional air pollution and investigate potential connections to Arctic climate. To compliment the measurements, we use a regional chemical transport model, WRF-Chem, to study the regional impacts of these local anthropogenic emissions. The model simulates emissions, transport, mixing, and chemical transformation of trace gases and aerosols simultaneously with meteorology. The model is used to examine ozone and aerosol formation in fresh and aged plumes...|$|R

As Helspont lay motionless on the ground, the WildC.A.T.s attacked Gnome and the Troika. Emp blew off the arm of Gnome and he dropped the orb down a shaft. He dove after it while everyone that was still alive escaped the building. The entire compound exploded moments later and Helspont, Gnome and the orb were all assumed dead or destroyed.|$|R
