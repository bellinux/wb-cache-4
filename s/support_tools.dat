The organizations of interest are Swedish municipal crisis management organizations and their crisis management teams. The goal is to investigate differences in the work processes of teams that have access to a GPS in its command post, compared to teams that do not. We have tested: 1) Non-professionals, a total of 132 students, forming 22 groups. 2) Professionals, a total of 108 professionals, forming 18 Swedish municipal crisis management teams. Results show that we get different performance and behaviours depending on the support and type of participants.

40|$|An {{effective}} way {{to reduce fuel consumption}} in the short run is to induce a change in driver behaviour. If drivers are prepared to change their driving habits they can complete the same journeys within similar travel times, but using significantly less fuel. In this paper, a prototype fuel-efficiency <b>support</b> <b>tool</b> is presented which helps drivers make the necessary behavioural adjustments. The <b>support</b> <b>tool</b> includes a normative model that back-calculates the minimal fuel consumption for manoeuvres carried out. If actual fuel consumption deviates from this optimum, the <b>support</b> <b>tool</b> presents advice to the driver on how to change his or her behaviour. To take account of the temporal nature of the driving task, advice is generated at two levels: tactical and strategic. Evaluation of the new <b>support</b> <b>tool</b> by means of a driving simulator experiment revealed that drivers were able to reduce overall fuel consumption by 16 % compared with ‘normal driving’. The same drivers were only able to achieve a reduction of 9 % when asked to drive fuel efficiently without support; thus, the tool gave an additional reduction of 7 %. Within a simulated urban environment, the additional reduction yielded by the <b>support</b> <b>tool</b> rose to 14 %.

After a cognitive task analysis was conducted to determine the functional and information requirements of the decision <b>support</b> <b>tool,</b> a human subject experiment was conducted to validate the design. Preliminary results show that the decision <b>support</b> <b>tool</b> improves team supervisor performance in terms of increased decision accuracy and decreased non-necessary interventions in single alert scenarios. In scenarios where the supervisor faced multiple simultaneous alerts, the decision <b>support</b> <b>tool</b> was shown to decrease non-necessary interventions and have no affect on mental workload as measured by a secondary task.

Though Inafune considers the gameplay {{to have lost}} some of its simplicity, he felt Mega Man's slide ability was successfully implemented to enhance the player's control while battling enemies. Mega Man's sidekick dog Rush was designed by combining the functionality of three <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> from Mega Man 2, which would ease the player's navigation of stages. In addition to the Marine and Coil modes, Rush was originally intended to have a [...] "drill" [...] mode that would allow Mega Man to tunnel underground. Another new character, Proto Man, was introduced {{in a way that the}} player would be unable to tell if he was an ally or an enemy to Mega Man. His design was influenced by anime, and he was given both a scarf and shield to make him appear [...] "tougher" [...] than Mega Man. The design team wanted Proto Man to sport uncovered hair, but they instead opted for an open-faced helmet illustration for both the television commercials and instruction manual. Proto Man's original Japanese name, Blues, was changed by Capcom's North American division despite Inafune's protests. Capcom did this not only to be consistent with Rockman's English name, but because they thought that the name Blues made no sense. Inafune attempted to defend it due to the name's musical connotation to character names in the series. Though Rush and Proto Man were created solely by the developer, Capcom sought ideas from fans for the creation of the game's Robot Masters as they had done with Mega Man 2. The team received around 50,000 design submissions for Mega Man 3, only eight of which were used in the game. Harumi Fujita, credited as [...] "Mrs. Tarumi", was the initial composer of the game, but she only completed a few songs before giving birth and having to drop off the project. She composed the songs ‘Needle Man’, ‘Gemini Man’ and ‘Staff Roll’. Capcom composer Yasuaki Fujita, also known as [...] "Bun Bun" [...] was then assigned to complete the soundtrack and created the majority of the score.|$|E

The design <b>support</b> <b>tool</b> provides dynamic guidance {{with the use of}} morphological design matrices during the conceptual or preliminary design stages. This paper tests the appropriateness of adopting a stochastic approach for supporting the early design phase. The rationale for the stochastic approach is based on the uncertain nature of the design during this part of the design process. The <b>support</b> <b>tool</b> is based on Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) and uses a simple but effective information content–based metric to learn or induce the model structure.
