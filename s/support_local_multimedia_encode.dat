In the emerging international <b>multimedia</b> <b>encoding</b> standard MPEG, continuity and synchronization are handled at different layers of the multimedia stream. We discuss how they are specified and propose techniques for their implementation within a distributed multimedia environment. ii 1 1 Introduction Multimedia services, in which stored media objects are retrieved on demand by end users, are rapidly emerging to be offered on digital communication networks. There are two distinguishing requirements of media playback: intra-media continuity and inter-media synchronization [6]. In the emerging international <b>multimedia</b> <b>encoding</b> standard MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group), continuity and synchronization are handled at different layers of the multimedia stream.

We show by experiments that the proposed scheme approaches the theoretical behavior, and quantify the gap with respect to a scheme specifically designed for a given loss probability.

Nonetheless, the Extreme Edition did achieve Intel's apparent aim, which was to prevent AMD from being the performance champion with the new Athlon 64, which was winning every single major benchmark over the existing Pentium 4s.|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{automatically}} locate and track objects from videos {{has always been}} very important in traditional applications such as surveillance, robotics, and object recognition. With the proliferation of digital videos and online multimedia data and the need of content-based <b>multimedia</b> <b>encoding</b> and retrieval, locating and tracking objects in digital videos become ever more important. This thesis presents a new technique based on feature localization for segmenting and tracking objects in videos. A video locale is a sequence of image feature locales that share similar features (color, texture, shape, and motion) in the spatio-temporal domain of videos. Image feature locales are grown from tiles (blocks of pixels) and can be non-disjoint and non-connected. Instead of using regions, the set of tiles belonging to the feature locale (called the envelope) is used to represent the locality of the feature. Intuitively, feature locales are significant feature blobs. To exploit the temporal redundancy in digital videos, two algorithms (intra-frame and inter-frame) are used to grow locales e#ciently. Multiple motion tracking is achieved by tracking and performing tile-based dominant motion estimation for each locale separately (i. e., only member tiles are used); hence, the di#culty of multiple non-dominating motions is avoided and using tiles as the base unit makes the method more robust to pixel-level noise. Furthermore, video locales that move together through time may be grouped together to approximate multi-feature video objects. Being at a higher feature level than pixels and more robust than regions, video locales are more suited for content-based video processing. How video locales {{may be used in}} content-based <b>multimedia</b> <b>encoding</b> and retrieval such as outlined in MPEG- [...] ...|$|R
