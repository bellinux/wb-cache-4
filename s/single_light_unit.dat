40|$|The new {{generation}} LED curing <b>light</b> <b>units</b> have significantly improved curing performance compared to first generation lights, {{and even some}} second generation LED curing <b>light</b> <b>units.</b> This study compared the curing performance of 10 {{new generation}} LED <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> (FLASH-lite 1401, LE Demetron 1, Coltolux, Ultra-Lume 5, Mini LED, bluephase, Elipar FreeLight 2, Radii, Smartlite IQ and Allegro) for depth of cure against a high-powered halogen curing <b>light</b> <b>unit</b> (Optilux 501). Depth of cure measurements were utilized per the ANSI/ADA No 27 standard to detect differences between the lights at three time intervals (10, 20 and 40 seconds). A total of 660 samples were prepared (n= 10 /group). A full factorial ANOVA and Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s HSD test showed FLASH-lite 1401 performed significantly {{better than the other}} lights at 10 - and 20 -second time intervals (p 3 ̆c 0. 01).

40|$|Objectives: This study {{investigated}} the effect of infection control barrier thickness on power density, wave-length, and light diffusion of <b>light</b> curing <b>units.</b> Materials and Methods: Infection control barrier (Cleanwrap) in one-fold, two-fold, four-fold, and eight-fold, and a halogen <b>light</b> curing <b>unit</b> (Optilux 360) and a light emitting diode (LED) <b>light</b> curing <b>unit</b> (Elipar FreeLight 2) were used in this study. Power density of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> with infection control barriers covering the fiberoptic bundle was measured with a hand held dental radiometer (Cure Rite). Wavelength of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> fixed on a custom made optical breadboard was measured with a portable spectroradiometer (CS- 1000). Light diffusion of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> was photographed with DSLR (Nikon D 70 s) as above. Results: Power density decreased significantly as the layer thickness of the infection control barrier increased, except the one-fold and two-fold in halogen <b>light</b> curing <b>unit.</b> Especially, when the barrier was four-fold and more in the halogen <b>light</b> curing <b>unit,</b> the decrease of power density was more prominent. The wavelength of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> was not affected by the barriers and almost no change was detected in the peak wavelength. Light diffusion of LED <b>light</b> curing <b>unit</b> was not affected by barriers, however, halo-gen <b>light</b> curing <b>unit</b> showed decrease in light diffusion angle when the barrier was four-fold and statisti...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare {{efficiency}} of broad spectrum LEDs (VALO�, Ultradent, USA) with conventional LED curing lights (EliparTM Freelight 2, 3 M ESPE, USA) using a microhardness test. The <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> used were VALO � in three different modes and EliparTM Freelight 2. The exposure time was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cured resin specimens were stored in physiological saline at 37 ℃ for 24 hours, microhardness was measured using Vickers microhardness tester. The microhard-ness of upper and lower sides of the specimens were analyzed separately by the ANOVA method (Analysis of Variance) with a significance level set at 5 %. At upper side of resin specimens, an increased microhardness was observed in the broad spectrum LED curing <b>light</b> <b>unit</b> with a high power mode for 4 seconds and plasma emulation mode for 20 seconds (p < 0. 05).

Composite resin disks were divided into 15 groups (n = 5), according to the factors under study: composite resin thickness (0 mm, 1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm and 4 mm) and <b>light</b> <b>units.</b> The <b>light</b> activation was performed with halogen light (HL) (40 s, 500 mW/cm(2)), argon ion laser (AL) (30 s, 600 mW/cm(2)) or light-emitting diode (LED) (30 s, 400 mW/cm(2)). Vickers micro-hardness tests were performed after 1 week and were carried out on the top surface (0 mm-control) and at different depths of the samples. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey tests (P a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0. 05) revealed no statistically significant difference among the <b>light</b> <b>units</b> for the groups of 0 mm and 1 mm thickness. At 2 mm depth, the AL was not statistically different from the HL, but the latter showed higher micro-hardness values than the LED.
