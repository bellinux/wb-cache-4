2500|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>sharks,</b> class Acanthodii, are extinct fishes {{that share}} {{features}} with both bony and cartilaginous fishes, though ultimately {{more closely related}} to and ancestral to the latter.

25|$|The Devonian Period {{is broken}} into the Early, Middle and Late Devonian.

50|$|By {{the start}} of the Early Devonian, 419 mya (million years ago), jawed fishes had divided into three {{distinct}} groups: the now extinct placoderms (a paraphyletic assemblage of ancient armoured fishes), the bony fishes and the clade including spiny sharks and early cartilaginous fish. The modern bony fishes, class Osteichthyes, appeared in the late Silurian or early Devonian, about 416 million years ago. Cartilaginous fishes first appeared about 395 Ma, having evolved from Doliodus-like <b>spiny</b> <b>shark</b> ancestors.

50|$|Ischanacanthiformes is {{an order}} of Acanthodii or <b>spiny</b> <b>sharks</b> found in Ukraine and United Kingdom.

50|$|Acanthodii or acanthodians (sometimes called <b>spiny</b> <b>sharks)</b> is a paraphyletic {{class of}} extinct teleostome fish, sharing {{features}} with both bony fish and cartilaginous fish.

50|$|Compared {{with other}} <b>spiny</b> <b>sharks,</b> Acanthodes was {{relatively}} large, at 30 cm long. The genus had no teeth, instead gills.

It was covered in scales that were cubical in shape.|$|R
50|$|Gogoselachus was a {{diminutive}} shark-like fish {{that was a}} fast-swimming predator. It probably hunted other fish, such as placoderms and primitive bony fish.

25|$|Fish, {{like many}} other organisms, have been greatly {{affected}} by extinction events throughout natural history.

The late Devonian extinction led to the extinction of the ostracoderms and placoderms {{by the end of the}} Devonian, as well as other fish. The <b>spiny</b> <b>sharks</b> became extinct at the Permian–Triassic extinction event; the conodonts became extinct at the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event. The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, and the present day Holocene extinction, have also affected fish variety and fish stocks.|$|R
50|$|Acanthodians are a type {{of ancient}} fish dating back the late Silurian period, often being called <b>spiny</b> <b>sharks.</b> Although they are not true sharks, they had spines on all of their fins, an {{important}} defensive adaptation.

25|$|The first jawed {{vertebrates}} probably {{developed during}} the late Ordovician period. They are first represented in the fossil record from the Silurian by two groups of fish: the armoured fish known as placoderms, which evolved from the ostracoderms; and the Acanthodii (or <b>spiny</b> <b>sharks).</b> The jawed fish that are still extant in modern days also appeared in late Silurian: the Chondrichthyes (or cartilaginous fish) and the Osteichthyes (or bony fish). The bony fish evolved into two separate groups: the Actinopterygii (or ray-finned fish) and Sarcopterygii (which includes the lobe-finned fish).|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{being called}} [...] "spiny sharks," [...] acanthodians predate sharks. Scales {{that have been}} {{tentatively}} identified as belonging to acanthodians, or [...] "shark-like fishes" [...] {{have been found in}} various Ordovician strata, though, they are ambiguous, and may actually belong to jawless fishes such as thelodonts. The earliest unequivocal acanthodian fossils date {{from the beginning of the}} Silurian Period, some 50 million years before the first sharks appeared. Later, the acanthodians colonized fresh waters, and throve in the rivers and lakes during the Devonian and in the coal swamps of Carboniferous. By this time bony fishes were already showing their potential to dominate the waters of the world, and their competition proved too much for the <b>spiny</b> <b>sharks,</b> which died out in Permian times (approximately 250 Million years ago).|$|R
5000|$|Jaws {{probably}} {{originated in}} the pharyngeal arches supporting the gills of jawless fish. The earliest jaws appeared in the now extinct placoderms and <b>spiny</b> <b>sharks</b> during the Silurian, about 430 million years ago. The original selective advantage offered by the jaw was probably not related to feeding, but to increased respiration efficiency — the jaws {{were used in the}} buccal pump to pump water across the gills. The familiar use of jaws for feeding would then have developed as a secondary function before becoming the primary function in many vertebrates. All vertebrate jaws, including the human jaw, evolved from early fish jaws. The appearance of the early vertebrate jaw has been described as [...] "perhaps the most profound and radical evolutionary step in the vertebrate history". Fish without jaws had more difficulty surviving than fish with jaws, and most jawless fish became extinct.|$|R
25|$|Lobe-finned fishes, such as {{coelacanths}} and lungfish, {{were the}} most diverse group of bony fishes in the Devonian. Taxonomists who subscribe to the cladistic approach include the grouping Tetrapoda within the Sarcopterygii, and the tetrapods in turn include all species of four-limbed vertebrates. The fin-limbs of lobe-finned fishes such as the coelacanths show a strong similarity to the expected ancestral form of tetrapod limbs. The lobe-finned fish apparently followed two different lines of development and are accordingly separated into two subclasses, the Rhipidistia (including the lungfish, and the Tetrapodomorpha, which include the Tetrapoda) and the Actinistia (coelacanths). The first lobe-finned fishes, found in the uppermost Silurian (ca 418 Ma), closely resembled <b>spiny</b> <b>sharks,</b> which became extinct {{at the end of}} the Paleozoic. In the early–middle Devonian (416 - 385 Ma), while the predatory placoderms dominated the seas, some lobe-finned fishes came into freshwater habitats.|$|R
50|$|Newer {{research}} suggests that a branch of Placoderms was most likely the ancestor of present-day gnathostomes. A 419-million-year-old fossil of a placoderm named Entelognathus had a bony skeleton and anatomical details associated with cartilaginous and bony fish, demonstrating {{that the absence of}} a bony skeleton in Chondrichthyes is a derived trait. The fossil findings of primitive bony fishes such as Guiyu oneiros and Psarolepis, which lived contemporaneously with Entelognathus and had pelvic girdles more in common with placoderms than with other bony fish, show that it was a relative rather than a direct ancestor of the extant gnathostomes. It also indicates that <b>spiny</b> <b>sharks</b> and Chondrichthyes represent a single sister group to the bony fishes. Fossils findings of juvenile placoderms, which had true teeth that grew {{on the surface of the}} jawbone and had no roots, making it impossible to replace or regrow as they broke or wore down as they grew older, proves the common ancestor of all gnathostomes had teeth and place the origin of teeth along with, or soon after, the evolution of jaws.|$|R
