5|$|After his Test debut, Hunt was {{expected}} to be the Queensland fullback in the first match of the three game <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> series. However, Queensland selectors decided to stay with incumbent Origin fullback Matt Bowen. The selectors reconsidered after Queensland lost the first game, selecting Hunt for the second match. In his <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> debut, Hunt ran with the ball seventeen times, making 196 metres. He missed the third Origin game because of a foot injury, sustained in the Broncos' Round 15 match, and was replaced by Clinton Schifcofske.|$|E

Hunt came on in the 25th minute of the game to replace the injured Justin Hodges and played in his centre position {{for the remainder of}} the match which Queensland won. The consequences of this game would be felt as part of the 2009 swine flu pandemic in Australia. Hunt's Queensland teammate Ben Hannant tested positive to the Swine influenza and the Brisbane Broncos subsequently put all of their Origin players in quarantine.|$|E

5|$|Hunt {{made his}} debut for the Brisbane Broncos in the National Rugby League (NRL) in 2004 and played every game that season, winning the Dally M Rookie of the Year award. Pimarily a fullback, {{he played for}} Brisbane until 2009 and {{was part of the}} Broncos team which won the Grand Final in 2006. In a {{controversial}} move, Hunt chose to play for Australia instead of his native New Zealand, citing a lifelong dream of playing for Queensland in the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin.</b> Hunt's performance in the 2006 NRL season resulted in his selection for Queensland and Australia (the Kangaroos) in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Matty Johns was a {{professional}} rugby league player from 1991 to 2002. He played for nine seasons with the Newcastle Knights, during which he and the Knights won the 1997 ARL season. He then played one season each with the Wigan Warriors and the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. During his career, {{he played in the}} <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> series for New South Wales four times, played international tests for Australia eight times, and was part of the Australian squad that won the 1995 Rugby League World Cup.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{knee injury}} which only left Hunt out {{for two weeks}} was enough to deny him the {{opportunity}} to regain the fullback position for Australia in the Centenary Test against New Zealand in May 2008. Hunt's place in the Queensland team for the 2008 <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> series was assured by Queensland coach Mal Meninga but there was speculation that Hunt could play five-eighth in place of injured teammate Darren Lockyer. While not the best five-eighth possibility for the Queensland representative team, his selection there would make way for the Australian fullback Billy Slater. Hunt, having never played a senior rugby league game at five-eighth, was controversially selected at the position for Queensland instead of the in-form Scott Prince.|$|E
5|$|After twelve matches for his <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> Brown {{was still}} {{to end up}} on the winning side. This changed in the next match against New South Wales. After their opponents had made 214, Brown top-scored with 95 as Queensland replied with 200. New South Wales made 264 to leave Brown's men 279 for victory. The captain led the way, {{combining}} with Geoff Cook in Queensland's then record first-wicket partnership of 265. Brown was out for 168, but his team held on to secure an eight-wicket victory over New South Wales. It was Brown's first win in Queensland colours. He then scored 81 in a ten-wicket defeat to South Australia, before adding a second victory, this time over Victoria. Brown ended the season by amassing 215 as Queensland reached 7/575 declared before completing an innings win. Brown topped the aggregates with 1,057 runs and was the only player to pass 1,000 runs for the season.|$|E

5|$|Despite the club's Grand Final defeat, Harley {{collected}} {{a range of}} individual accolades following his performances throughout the season. He earned his first All-Australian honour and was named as vice-captain of the team. Harley was also recognised by the AFLPA, as {{he was awarded the}} AFLPA Best Captain award in just his second season at the helm. After setting career-highs of 209 handballs and 378 disposals during the season, Harley was awarded a career-high seven Brownlow Medal votes during the count and named once again in the South Australian <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> team.

5|$|Following record attendances at <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> {{fixtures}} in Melbourne of 87,161 in 1994 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground), the Australian Rugby League (ARL) {{had planned}} to establish a Melbourne-based team in the Premiership by 1998. However, the disruption caused by the Super League war caused great change to the game in Australia. By May 1997, Super League boss John Ribot pushed for a Melbourne-based club for his competition, which was the rival of the ARL. Former Brisbane Broncos centre Chris Johns became the CEO of the club and Ribot {{stepped down from the}} head of Super League to set up the club. In September 1997, Melbourne announced that Chris Anderson would be their foundation coach, and then Super League announced that the new team would be named the Melbourne Storm.|$|E
5|$|Harley's {{leadership}} {{qualities and}} {{influence on the}} club as captain was commended {{early on in the}} season after his handling of teammate Steve Johnson's off-field discretions. Johnson was banished from the team during the pre-season and demoted to the reserves for the first five games of the season. However, he successfully returned to the team and finished the season as a Norm Smith Medallist and All-Australian. Harley's leadership influence on the team was reflected in his finishing fourth in the AFLPA Best Captain award during his first year at the helm. He was also awarded life membership of the Geelong Football Club following his 150th team appearance in the round sixteen win against the Western Bulldogs, and named in the end-of-season South Australian <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> team.|$|E

5|$|Having {{lived in}} Queensland {{most of his}} life, Irwin was also a fan of rugby league. As a teenager, he played for the Caloundra Sharks as a second-rower, and as an adult {{he was known to}} be a passionate Brisbane Broncos fan and was {{involved}} with the club on several occasions. On one occasion after turning up to training he asked if he could tackle the largest player, Shane Webcke. Despite being thrown to the ground and looking like he'd been crushed he was jovial about the experience. Irwin laughingly shared the experience with the Queensland <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> squad before the 2006 series. Irwin also supported rugby union, being a fan of the national team, the Wallabies. He once wore a Wallaby jersey during a demonstration at the zoo. A behind-the-scenes episode of The Crocodile Hunter showed Irwin and the crew finding a petrol station in a remote part of Namibia to watch the Wallabies defeat France in the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final. Irwin was also a talented surfer.|$|E
5|$|Hunt {{retained}} his fullback {{position for}} Australia in the 2007 ANZAC Test. Hunt ran the ball 18 times, {{the most of}} any player, and scored one try in a man-of-the-match performance as Australia won 30–6. Hunt was named fullback for all three games of the 2007 <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> series, despite the club form of rival fullbacks Billy Slater and Matt Bowen. In the second game, Hunt played a full match despite aggravating his foot injury as Queensland won the match and the series. He also played in the third Origin game despite suffering a calf injury during training. Hunt was not considered for selection in the end of year Test for Australia against New Zealand due to a hamstring injury sustained earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|Though Hunt was {{considered}} for the 2004 <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> series among other fullbacks, he was ignored for the entire series in favour of Penrith Panthers fullback Rhys Wesser. Hunt's good form in 2006 paid off when he was selected {{to play for the}} Australian team against New Zealand on 5 May as a replacement for the injured Anthony Minichiello. This decision proved controversial, due to his being preferred over the in-form Matt Bowen. That game was Hunt's representative and international debut, and though he performed well, he only played for 50 minutes, making one error and 83 metres in kick returns. However, he was unable to complete the game due to concussion sustained by a blow from Frank Pritchard. He was taken unconscious from the field and played no further part in the match.|$|E

5|$|Whimpress tabled various {{hypotheses}} for Crockett's actions. At the time, Crockett was 37 {{years old}} {{and was ready to}} emerge from the shadow of Phillips, the eminent Australian umpire of the time. When Crockett called Marsh, it was his 29th match as a first-class umpire and the no-balling was seen in some quarters as a signal that he felt ready to officiate in Test matches. A cynical view of Crockett's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then the umpire was going to choose a soft target. This theory ruled out the calling of a fellow Victorian, his <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The same line of reasoning concluded that a New South Welshman would be called, and likely not a high-profile Test player like Noble or Jack Saunders. Those who adhered to this hypothesis believed that it would be easier for Crockett to target someone who had a previous stigma of throwing and that Marsh—an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17.38—was an ideal target.|$|E
