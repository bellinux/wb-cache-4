5|$|The <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutan</b> genome was sequenced in January 2011. Following {{humans and}} chimpanzees, the <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutan</b> became the third species of hominid {{to have its}} genome sequenced. Subsequently, the Bornean species had its genome sequenced. Genetic {{diversity}} {{was found to be}} lower in Bornean orangutans (P.pygmaeus) than in Sumatran ones (P.abelii), despite the fact that Borneo is home to six or seven times as many orangutans as Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutan</b> populations {{declined}} by 80% in 75 years. This species is now {{found only in}} the northern part of Sumatra, with most of the population inhabiting the Leuser Ecosystem. In late March 2012, a once-significant population in northern Sumatra were reported to be threatened with approaching forest fires and might be wiped out entirely within a matter of weeks.|$|E
5|$|The orangutans (also spelled orang-utan, orangutang, or orang-utang) {{are three}} extant species of great apes native to Indonesia and Malaysia. Orangutans are {{currently}} only {{found in the}} rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. Classified in the genus Pongo, orangutans were originally considered to be one species. From 1996, they {{were divided into two}} species: the Bornean orangutan (P. pygmaeus, with three subspecies) and the <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutan</b> (P. abelii). In November 2017 it was reported that a third species had been identified, the Tapanuli orangutan (P. tapanuliensis).|$|E
50|$|Male <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutans</b> grow {{to about}} 1.4 m tall and 90 kg. Females are smaller, {{averaging}} 90 cm and 45 kg. Compared to the Bornean species, <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutans</b> are thinner and have longer faces; their hair is longer with a paler red color.|$|R

5|$|The populations {{on the two}} islands were {{classified}} as separate species when P. abelii was described by Lesson in 1827. Later P. abelii was placed under P. pygmaeus, first as a synonym, then in 1985 as a subspecies. In 1996, P. abelii was elevated back to full species status, and the three distinct populations on Borneo were elevated to subspecies. The population currently listed as P.p.wurmbii may {{be closer to the}} <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutan</b> than the other Bornean orangutan subspecies. If confirmed, abelii would be a subspecies of P.wurmbii (Tiedeman, 1808).|$|E

He has also campaigned for the <b>Sumatran</b> <b>Orangutan</b> Society. For his works in environmental conservation, he received an honorary doctorate in conservation and sustainability from the Australian University of the Sunshine Coast in October 2014.|$|E
25|$|Orangutans {{have been}} {{observed}} using sticks to apparently measure the depth of water. It {{has been reported that}} orangutans use tools {{for a wide range of}} purposes including using leaves as protective gloves or napkins, using leafy branches to swat insects or gather water, and building sun or rain covers above the nests used for resting. It has been reported that a <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutan</b> used a large leaf as an umbrella in a tropical rainstorm.|$|E

50|$|A survey {{published}} in March 2016 estimates {{a population of}} 14,613 <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutans</b> in the wild, doubling previous population estimates. A survey in 2004 estimated that around 7,300 <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutans</b> {{still live in the}} wild. The same study estimates a 20,552 km2 occupied area for the <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutans,</b> of which only an approximate area range of 8,992 km2 harbors permanent populations. Some of them are being protected in five areas in Gunung Leuser National Park; others live in unprotected areas: northwest and northeast Aceh block, West Batang Toru river, East Sarulla and Sidiangkat. A successful breeding program has been established in Bukit Tiga Puluh National Park in Jambi and Riau provinces. The main reason for the endangerment of these orangutans is because of palm oil companies destroying the native rain forests.|$|R
25|$|<b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutans</b> use {{sticks to}} acquire seeds from a {{particular}} fruit. When {{the fruit of the}} Neesia tree ripens, its hard, ridged husk softens until it falls open. Inside are seeds that are highly desirable to the orangutans, but they are surrounded by fibreglass-like hairs that are painful if eaten. A Neesia-eating orangutan will select a 12cm stick, strip off the bark, and then carefully collect the hairs with it. Once the fruit is safe, the ape will eat the seeds using the stick or its fingers. <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutans</b> will use a stick to poke a bees' nest wall, move it around and catch the honey.|$|R
25|$|In November 2006, Perth Zoo {{released}} 14-year-old, Perth Zoo-born <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutan</b> Temara into Bukit Tigapuluh {{as part of}} the reintroduction program. Temara was {{the first}} zoo-born orangutan in the world to be released into the wild. This was followed in 2011 with the release of the first male zoo-born orangutan, Semeru, into the wild. Perth Zoo works with the Frankfurt Zoological Society, Indonesian Government and the Australian Orangutan Project on this program and other conservation activities in Bukit Tigapuluh.|$|E
25|$|Many {{native species}} such as Sumatran elephants, Sumatran tigers, Sumatran {{rhinoceros}}, Javan rhinoceros and orangutans are listed as endangered or critically endangered, and the remaining populations are found in national parks and other conservation areas. <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutan</b> can be visited in the Bukit Lawang conservation area, while the Bornean orangutan can be visited in Tanjung Puting national park, Central Kalimantan. The world's largest flower, rafflesia arnoldi, and the tallest flower, titan arum, {{can be found in}} Sumatra.|$|E
25|$|Biologists {{classify}} humans, {{along with}} only a few other species, as great apes (species in the family Hominidae). The living Hominidae include two distinct species of chimpanzee (the bonobo, Pan paniscus, and the common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes), two species of gorilla (the western gorilla, Gorilla gorilla, and the eastern gorilla, Gorilla graueri), and two species of orangutan (the Bornean orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus, and the <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutan,</b> Pongo abelii). The great apes with the family Hylobatidae of gibbons form the superfamily Hominoidea of apes.|$|E

50|$|On July 1, 1999, the zoo {{opened a}} new primate exhibit, the PECO Primate Reserve. It {{features}} 2.5 acre of indoor and outdoor exhibits with ten species of primates, including <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutans,</b> Western lowland gorillas, lemurs, langurs, and gibbons.|$|R
25|$|The Asian Rainforest {{is home to}} {{a number}} of {{threatened}} Asian species. These include Asian elephants, Asian small-clawed otters, red pandas, Javan gibbons, Sumatran orangutans, Sumatran tigers, sun bears, and white-cheeked gibbons. Perth Zoo contributes to the conservation of many of these species in the wild. The zoo's <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutan</b> breeding program is the most successful in the world, having bred 27 orangutans since 1970. In 2006 and 2011, zoo-born orangutans were released into the wild in Bukit Tigapuluh National Park in Sumatra as part of an international program to re-establish a wild population of the critically endangered ape.|$|E
25|$|Much of Indonesia's {{deforestation}} {{is caused}} by forest clearing for the palm oil industry, which has cleared 18 million hectares of forest for palm oil expansion. This requires land reallocation as well as changes to the local and natural ecosystems. Palm oil expansion can generate wealth for local communities, {{but it can also}} degrade ecosystems and cause social problems. This makes Indonesia the world's fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Such activity also threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species, including 140 species of mammals identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as threatened, and 15 identified as critically endangered, including the Bali starling, <b>Sumatran</b> <b>orangutan,</b> and Javan rhinoceros.|$|E
