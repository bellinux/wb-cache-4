5000|$|In {{some forms}} of AM, the carrier may be reduced, to save power. The term DSB - Reduced Carrier {{normally}} implies enough carrier remains in the transmission to enable a receiver circuit to regenerate a strong carrier or at least synchronise a phase-locked loop but there are forms where the carrier is removed completely, producing double sideband with suppressed carrier (DSB-SC). Suppressed carrier systems require more <b>sophisticated</b> <b>circuits</b> in the receiver and some other method of deducing the original carrier frequency. An example is the stereophonic difference (L-R) information transmitted in stereo FM broadcasting on a 38 kHz subcarrier where a low-power signal at half the 38-kHz carrier frequency is inserted between the monaural signal frequencies (up to 15 kHz) and {{the bottom of the}} stereo information sub-carrier (down to 38-15 kHz, i.e. 23kHz). The receiver locally regenerates the subcarrier by doubling a special 19 kHz pilot tone. In another example, the quadrature modulation used historically for chroma information in PAL television broadcasts, the synchronising signal is a short burst of a few cycles of carrier during the [...] "back porch" [...] part of each scan line when no image is transmitted. But in other DSB-SC systems, the carrier may be regenerated directly from the sidebands by a Costas loop or squaring loop. This is common in digital transmission systems such as BPSK where the signal is continually present.|$|E

Driver integrated circuit (IC) is a critical device that is embedded <b>sophisticated</b> <b>circuits</b> to drive panels. Since narrow border design on display products is current trend, dimensions of driver ICs are shrunken.

Conventionally, manufacturing yield is evaluated applying typical yield measure index method under the assumptions that the processes are stable and normal. To assess manufacturing yield for Gamma wafer sawing processes more accurately, we present a modified yield measure index method.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 The {{central focus}} of this thesis is the design, {{fabrication}} and characterization of amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) thin-film transistor (TFT) current mirrors. The thin-film deposition and circuit fabrication methods used to realize zinc tin oxide (ZTO) TFT current mirrors are {{addressed in order to}} elucidate the processing challenges for this material system. Accurate current mirror behavior is demonstrated for current mirrors with small mirroring ratios. Deviations from the ideal mirroring ratio are attributed to three primary sources: TFT geometric mismatch, threshold voltage mismatch, and finite output resistance. The most significant source of mirroring error for the current mirrors fabricated is geometric mismatch associated with processing. Variations in TFT size leading to mirroring error arise from the use of mylar masks, inconsistent channel etching, and lift-off patterning of source-drain contacts. Geometric mismatch must be reduced before the effects of threshold voltage mismatch and finite output resistance on mirroring error can be unambiguously assessed. TFT size variation, and thus mirroring error, can be reduced by using chrome masks, developing an improved channel etch, avoiding lift-off processing and utilizing more <b>sophisticated</b> <b>circuit</b> layout. The work of this thesis continues to support the use of AOS for a variety of applications. Current mirrors are a vital analog circuit building block, used in a multitude of circuits, without which the scope of AOS-based electronics will be limited.
