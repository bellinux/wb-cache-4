5000|$|The Array Unit was {{the heart}} of the MPP, being the 128x128 array of 16,384 {{processing}} elements.Each PE was connected to its four nearest neighbors - north, south, east, and west.The array could be configured as a plane, a cylinder, a daisy-chain or as a torus.The PEs were implemented on a custom <b>silicon-on-sapphire</b> LSI chip which contained eight of the PEs as a 2x4 subarray.

The operating frequency of the array was 10 MHz.Data-bus states of all 16,384 PEs were combined in a tree of inclusive-or logic elements whose single output was used in the Array Control Unit for operations such as finding the maximum or minimum value of an array in parallel.A register in each PE controlled masking of operations [...] - [...] masked operations wereonly performed on those PEs where this register bit was set.|$|E
5000|$|For example, H. T. Chen, in 2008, {{were able}} to {{fabricate}} a repeating split-ring resonator (SRR) cell with semiconductor material aligning the gaps. This initial step in metamaterial research expanded the spectral range of operation for a given, specific, metamaterial device. Also this {{opened the door for}} implementing new device concepts. The importance of incorporating the semiconductor material this way is noted because of the higher frequency ranges at which this metamaterial operates. It is suitable at terahertz (THz) and higher frequencies, where the entire metamaterial composite may have more than 104 unit cells, along with bulk-vertical integration of the tuning elements. Strategies employed for tuning at lower frequencies would not be possible {{because of the number of}} unit cells involved. The semiconductor material, such as silicon, is controlled by photoexcitation. This in turn controls, or alters, the effective size of the capacitor and tunes the capacitance. The whole structure is not just semiconductor material. This was termed a 'hybrid', because the semiconductor material was fused with dielectric material; a <b>silicon-on-sapphire</b> (SOS) wafer.
