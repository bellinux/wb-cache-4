Construction on WNP-5 was terminated in January 1982 while only 16 percent complete. Of the original five proposed nuclear units, only WNP-2 was completed and put into operation.|$|R
50|$|Canada started <b>selling</b> war <b>bonds</b> <b>in</b> 1917 <b>to</b> {{raise money}} during World War I for the Allies of World War I. Five bond campaigns were held from 1915-1919. To {{advertise}} the purchasing of Victory Loans, the Victory Loan Dominion Publicity Committee created artwork, held parades, and had celebrity endorsements.

50|$|Art Institute of Chicago {{professor}} Lorado Taft led {{a public}} campaign {{to restore the}} building {{and turn it into}} another art museum, one devoted to sculpture. The South Park Commissioners (now part of the Chicago Park District) won approval in a referendum <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> $5 million <b>in</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> pay for restoration costs, hoping to turn the building into a sculpture museum, a technical trade school, and other things. However, after a few years, the building was selected as the site for a new science museum.|$|R
5000|$|... "For Your Boy and My Boy" [...] was {{originally}} written for a Liberty Loan drive which looked <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> support the allied cause during World War I. It calls upon the patriotic duty of citizens {{to help out}} the soldiers over seas by buying bonds and funding the war effort. The chorus line [...] "Ev'ry bond that we are buying will help the boys to cross the Rhine. Buy bonds, buy bonds, for your boy and mine," [...] is repeated throughout the song to {{emphasize the importance of}} buying bonds.|$|R
50|$|In 1907, Ashdown {{was elected}} mayor of Winnipeg and served {{for two years}} before being {{defeated}} by William Sanford Evans. Winnipeg was hit by a recession in 1907, as an indirect consequence of the Wall Street panic in that year, with construction hardest hit during that period. Ashdown travelled to Montreal, New York and London with hopes of <b>selling</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> pay off large loans from the banks but was unsuccessful. Various developments within the city such as the Louise Bridge construction, a gas plant and a hydro-electric plant at Pointe de Bois would have to be postponed until better times.|$|R
2500|$|Young first {{obtained}} {{an option}} to purchase the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company (of Newport News, Virginia), then approached Nixon, {{who was then the}} lessor of the Crescent Shipyard in Elizabethport, New Jersey. [...] Nixon agreed to work with Young in forming the proposed combination, and granted him an option on his own plant. [...] They then obtained options to purchase other shipbuilding companies. [...] Working with a cotton industry bank known as the Trust Company of the Republic, they sought out underwriters, and planned to issue stock and <b>sell</b> <b>bonds,</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> provide the funds to buy the plants and then operate them at a profit.|$|R
2500|$|In 1998, it was {{reported}} that the school was in need of US$18 million in repairs. [...] The board responded by <b>selling</b> US$19 million <b>in</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> raise money to make repairs, including a new roof, general upgrades to come into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, new ceilings, new windows, and new insulation. [...] The monies would also be used for moving the tennis courts and baseball field, as well as demolition and reconstruction of the football stadium to give it a north-south orientation. [...] As a part of the athletic field upgrades, the school was able to purchase neighboring property, and then went to court to secure more property from the village. [...] The school paid US$800,000 for the property from the village.|$|R
50|$|The Sustainable Energy Bond (SEB) Program was {{pioneered by}} Dr. Byrne {{to build a}} clean energy {{infrastructure}} from guaranteed savings earned by participants. The SEU uses bonds at a scale which allows a city or a region to treat conserved and renewable energy as primary sources rather than the current situation in which fossil and nuclear energy sources dominate. Historically, tax-exempt <b>bonds</b> were used <b>to</b> underwrite investments in public goods and services and, for this reason, SEBs {{are seen as a}} critical tool for SEUs to serve their communities. An SEU can be given bond issuing capacity which allows it <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> tax-exempt <b>bonds</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> treat sustainable energy as an infrastructure scale investment.|$|R
50|$|Following in {{line with}} the Republican Party {{national}} platform of 1868, Secretary Boutwell advocated reduction of national debt and the return of the nation's economy to one based on gold. Boutwell believed that the stabilization of the currency and the reduction of the national debt was more important than risking a depression by withdrawing greenbacks from the economy. On his own, without approval or knowledge of either President Grant or other Cabinet members, Boutwell began to release gold from the Treasury and <b>sell</b> government <b>bonds,</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> reduce the supply of greenbacks (paper currency) in the economy. The result of this policy was that gold prices declined and the national debt was reduced. However, it also created a deflationary economy, in which farmers had trouble obtaining needed cash to pay for their farming activity.|$|R
5|$|In 1873, Barton S. Alexander {{completed}} a {{report for the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{that was the first}} attempt at creating a Central Valley Project. In 1904, the Bureau of Reclamation (then the Reclamation Service) first became interested in creating such a water project, but did not get far involved until a series of droughts and related disasters occurred in the early 1920s. The State of California passed the Central Valley Project Act in 1933, which authorized Reclamation <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> revenue <b>bonds</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> raise about $170 million for the project. Unfortunately, because of insufficient money in the state's treasury and the coincidence with the Great Depression, California turned to the national government for funding to build the project. This resulted in several transfers of the project between California and the federal government, and between Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The first dams and canals of the project started going up in the late 1930s, and the last facilities were completed in the early 1970s. Other features of the project were never constructed, some lie partly finished, or are still awaiting authorization.|$|R
5000|$|Young first {{obtained}} {{an option}} to purchase the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company (of Newport News, Virginia), then approached Nixon, {{who was then the}} lessor of the Crescent Shipyard in Elizabethport, New Jersey. Nixon agreed to work with Young in forming the proposed combination, and granted him an option on his own plant. [...] They then obtained options to purchase other shipbuilding companies. Working with a cotton industry bank known as the Trust Company of the Republic, they sought out underwriters, and planned to issue stock and <b>sell</b> <b>bonds,</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> provide the funds to buy the plants and then operate them at a profit. An initial prospectus was prepared for issue on May 7, 1901, but the actual issuance was withheld at the last moment because of {{what became known as the}} Northern Pacific “short squeeze” of 1901, a panic that occurred on that date. [...] A news dispatch of that date described the proposed combination. It described a combination that would include Union Iron Works (of San Francisco), Bath Iron Works of Bath, Maine, Hyde Windlass Co. (also of Bath), Crescent Shipyard, Samuel J. Moore & Sons Co. of Elizabethport, New Jersey, Canda Manufacturing Co. of Carteret, New Jersey, and Newport News Shipping and Drydock Co. All but Canda Manufacturing were shipyards, and Canda (which manufactured car wheels) reportedly owned a prime location near Staten Island for construction of a new shipyard.|$|R
40|$|Impact {{investing}} {{has been}} revolutionary {{in the history}} of capital markets. The concept refers to investments with the intention of generating positive social impact over and above financial returns. Over the last six years, impact investing has moved from the margins to the mainstream with an estimated market size of $ 46 billion in 2014 (World Economic Forum, 2014), shifting the paradigm on how the world blends impact with financial returns. But there is more to be achieved. A 55 % annual growth rate would be required to reach the target market size of $ 1 trillion by 2020 (J. P. Morgan, 2010). This exponential growth can be achieved only by unlocking mission-oriented capital at scale, by bringing in new actors from the private sector to support sustainable development and by developing innovative financial products that can channelize resources to high impact entities - which in turn can deliver scalable and sustainable market-based solutions. Leveraging its expertise in innovative finance, Impact Investment Exchange Asia (IIX) sets out to achieve this by developing a new financial product that seeks to bridge the current gap between development and finance: the IIX Sustainability Bond (ISB). ISBs are debt securities that pool together in a single portfolio, a group of high-impact entities that have undergone a rigorous due diligence process based on both social and financial criteria. This unique pooled structure allows underlying borrowers to access large amounts of capital that they would not otherwise have been able to raise individually. ISBs are designed to be sustainable instruments, offering attractive rates of risk-adjusted returns to impact investors who are interested in a double bottom line. ISBs will be listed on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius, adding an additional layer of secondary liquidity, mission protection and transparency. IIX's commitment-to action to the Clinton Global initiative, the first ISB, is the Women's Livelihood Bond (WLB), a $ 20 million debt security designed to unlock capital for Impact Enterprises (IEs) and Microfinance Institute (MFIs) {{that are part of the}} sustainable livelihoods spectrum for women in South-East Asia. The WLB is projected to empower over half a million women with access to credit, to market linkages, to natural resources and to affordable goods and services. This will, in turn, help them transition from subsistence to sustainable livelihoods and redefine the dominant narrative from viewing women as victims to recognizing them as solutions to development, change and progress. This Blueprint Paper, developed by IIX's sister non-profit entity Shujog, aims to provide an overview of the bond mechanics by outlining the key steps involved <b>in</b> the <b>bond</b> structuring process. Supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, a visionary catalyst in the impact investing space, this preliminary paper will capture the progress made to date by IIX on product, pipeline and partnership development. A subsequent paper will be published post bond issuance which will capture the key steps involved <b>in</b> <b>selling</b> the <b>bond</b> <b>to</b> investors and listing it on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius. Shujog hopes this paper will act as a roadmap for other stakeholders in the space to create similar instruments that are designed to change finance and finance change...|$|R
