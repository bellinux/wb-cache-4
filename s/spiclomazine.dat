40|$|The {{effective}} treatment for pancreatic carcinoma remains critically needed. Herein, this current {{study showed that}} <b>spiclomazine</b> treatment caused a reduction in viability in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines CFPAC- 1 and MIA PaCa- 2 in vitro. It was notable in this regard that, compared with pancreatic carcinoma cells, normal human embryonic kidney (HEK- 293) and liver (HL- 7702) cells were more resistant to the antigrowth effect of <b>spiclomazine.</b> Biochemically, <b>spiclomazine</b> treatment regulated the expression of protein levels in the apoptosis related pathways. Consistent with this effect, <b>spiclomazine</b> reduced the mitochondria membrane potential, elevated reactive oxygen species, and activated caspase- 3 / 9. In addition, a key finding from {{this study was that}} <b>spiclomazine</b> suppressed migration and invasion of cancer cells through down-regulation of MMP- 2 / 9. Collectively, the proposed studies did shed light on the antiproliferation effect of <b>spiclomazine</b> on pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, and further clarified the mechanisms that <b>spiclomazine</b> induced apoptosis associated with the suppression of migration and invasion...|$|E
