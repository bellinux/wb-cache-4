40|$|Background: Prediction of the {{malignant}} {{course is}} important in patients with stroke in order to begin interventional treatment strategies.

Materials and Methods: In this cross-section study electroencephalography findings were evaluate in 36 patients suffering <b>stroke.</b> <b>Data</b> <b>were</b> analyzed with Fishers exact test. Results: Fourteen patients had malignant and 22 patients had a non-malignant course.

40|$|Abstract: Stroke {{fragmentation}} is {{the core}} of the pen-based interaction. This paper presents a novel method of stroke fragmentation, which combines geometric features and HMM (hidden Markov model). Four geometric features are employed to describe the local geometry of strokes, and a HMM structure is designed to model the drawing context to describe the global. Furthermore, <b>stroke</b> <b>data</b> <b>is</b> compressed as much as possible with the least loss of information by means of global searching and the best matching algorithm. It can locate the segment point and judge the primitive type simultaneously with acceptable computation efficiency. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

40|$|This {{aim of this}} interpretive {{case study}} was to {{understand}} meanings {{of the experience of}} illness from the perspective of eight survivors of <b>stroke.</b> <b>Data</b> <b>were</b> collected by means of semi-structured interviews and qualitative thematic analysis. The experience of stroke generated negative feelings such as fear of death, disability, loss of autonomy and inability to work. Social support of family and religion was essential to cope with the changes in everyday life and inefficiency of the health care network experienced by the participants. Lack of guidance was identified, especially from nurses, for home care of patients. The results of the study suggest the need to strengthen health education on predictive symptoms of stroke, awareness of the impacts of this disease on the life of survivors, and the need for multidisciplinary health care teams to encourage proactivity of survivors' family members...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Wildland fires {{attributed}} to lightning ignitions in Victoria, Australia, are examined systematically {{through the use}} of lightning occurrence <b>data.</b> Lightning <b>stroke</b> <b>data</b> <b>were</b> obtained by a network of ground-based lightning detection sensors over a 9 -year period. Characteristics of these fires are examined including the temporal variability in the average chance of fire occurrence per lightning stroke and the time period from lightning ignition of a fire until the fire grows large enough to be first observed, as well as distributions of fire duration and total area burnt. It is found that the time of day that lightning occurs does not have a significant influence on the chance of fire per lightning stroke, in contrast to the time of year, for which a significant annual variation occurs. Regional variability is examined by discussing the results for Victoria, Australia, in relation to results of studies {{from other parts of the}} world...|$|R

KEEP volunteers completed surveys and underwent blood pressure and laboratory testing. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was computed, and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) was measured.
