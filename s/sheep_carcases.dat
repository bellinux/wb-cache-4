40|$|Investigations in the winter-rainfall {{area were}} carried out with the object of obtaining a {{complete}} picture of the blowfly-sheep-carcase complex. The rainfall is well distributed over the whole year, the climate is mild and humidity is relatively high. Under these conditions sheep are susceptible during all seasons so that Lucilia cuprina causes strikes and breeds almost exclusively on live sheep throughout the year. It did not breed in <b>sheep</b> <b>carcases</b> {{at any time and}} only a few L. cuprina were obtained from four small carcases in winter. The <b>sheep</b> <b>carcases</b> produced mainly Chrysomyia chloropyga during the cooler months and C. albiceps and C. marginalis in summer. These flies were not found to strike sheep. The questions of competition between Lucilia and Chrysomyia and of the conditions under which C. chloropyga causes strike are briefly discussed. The latter question merits further investigation. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

40|$|Food Science Australia {{has been}} {{developing}} sensing systems that are suitable for use in automating tasks commonly seen in Australian meat processing plants. This paper discusses the process of automating the sheep brisket cutting task. The prototype automated system was defined and developed and a standard manual brisket cutter was adapted to an ABB industrial robot for demonstration to industry. The prototype system scanned, analysed and cut the brisket of <b>sheep</b> <b>carcases</b> in less than 6 seconds to conform with Australian production speed. ...|$|E
40|$|In Australia, {{dentition}} (eruption {{of permanent}} incisors) {{is used as}} a proxy for age to define sheep meat quality. Lamb is defined as having no permanent incisors, hogget as having at least one incisor and mutton is defined as having two or more incisors. Classification of the carcase is done at the abattoir prior to the removal of an animal’s head. Recently, an Australian Senate inquiry into meat marketing reported that there was concern that substitution of hogget and mutton for lamb may be occurring in the industry. At present, no objective method is available {{that can be used for}} classifying sheep category. The general aims of this thesis were to i) evaluate whether chemical analysis of branched chain fatty acid (BCFA) content could be used as an objective tool to determine sheep age, ii) understand the effect that some production factors had on BCFA concentrations in Australian sheep and iii) develop new approaches (whether chemical and/or statistical) for determining sheep category (age). BCFAs are implicated as the main contributors to “mutton flavour”, often associated with the cooked meat of older animals. BCFAs are reported to increase with age, which suggests that chemical analysis of these compounds could be used as an objective method. Concentrations of three BCFAs (4 -methyloctanoic (MOA), 4 -ethyloctanoic (EOA) and 4 - methylnonanoic (MNA) acids) were measured in a survey of fat samples taken from 533 <b>sheep</b> <b>carcases</b> at abattoirs in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. This thesis shows that, on its own, chemical analysis of the BCFAs is not sufficient to discriminate lamb from hogget and mutton as pre-slaughter nutrition is a significant factor in classifying sheep using this approach. Uncertainty at the BCFA concentration ranges found in Australian sheep was determined to be high making it difficult to discriminate between <b>sheep</b> <b>carcases</b> of different ages based on the BCFA level. Fast gas chromatography was evaluated as the basis for a high throughput chemical technique but was not sufficiently sensitive for BCFA measurements. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was also found to be suitable for sampling 3 -methylindole and p-cresol, compounds responsible for diet-related “pastoral flavour” in sheep fat, but further work is needed to validate this approach for measurement of these compounds in sheep fat. Statistical classification algorithms, when applied to the chromatograms measured for the 533 carcasses, showed great promise for predicting sheep category. Specifically, the random forests algorithm, when applied to mean-centred data, gave 100...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 523 chilled beef and lamb {{carcases}} were sampled from four abattoirs and 13 very small plants (VSPs) in South Australia during March 2002 {{in order to}} develop a microbiological profile of meat produced for domestic consumption within the State. Aerobic viable counts (AVCs) and Escherichia coli counts were obtained from samples taken by sponge-sampling the muscle-adipose tissue at sites designated for each species in the Microbiological Guidelines to the Australian Standard for Hygienic Production of Meat for Human Consumption (identical with those of the USA Pathogen Reduction: hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) systems: final rule). On beef carcases (n = 159) mean log AVC/cm 2 was 1. 82 and E. coli was detected on 18. 8 % of carcases (area sampled 200 cm 2) for which the mean log of the positives was 0. 34; for lamb carcases, on which 75 cm 2 was sampled (n = 364), corresponding values were 2. 59, 36. 2 % and log 10 0. 27, respectively. There was little difference in mean log AVC/cm 2 of carcases produced at abattoirs and VSPs, 1. 72 versus 1. 81, respectively, for beef, and 2. 80 versus 2. 44, respectively, for sheep. Prevalence of E. coli was lower at VSPs, however, with abattoirs having 28. 4 % for beef and 61. 5 % for sheep, compared with corresponding values of 4. 7 % and 18. 5 % at VSPs. In VSPs, the range of mean log AVC/cm 2 was 0. 47 – 3. 16 for beef and 1. 63 – 3. 65 for <b>sheep</b> <b>carcases,</b> data which will allow the Controlling Authority to assist plants to improve performance of slaughter and dressing techniques. The present survey is part of an assessment by the State mea...|$|E
