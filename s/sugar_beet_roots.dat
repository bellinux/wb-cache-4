The mortality of adults, depending on product was observed every half an hour, starting from 0. 5 up to 28 hrs of exposition.

According to position and slope (b) of ld-p lines in 1996, higher toxity of cypermethrin than of monocrotophos was found. The response was more homogeneous to cypermethrin than to monocrotophos.

In 1997, at 14 °C and 25 °C, higher toxity of cypermethrin than of monocrotophos was observed, the effect of mixture was additive. No mortality was induced with monocrotophos at 20 °C.
