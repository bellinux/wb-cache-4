40|$|International audienceTime-reversing the <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> {{between a}} time-reversal mirror (TRM) and a distant probe source {{location}} generates an acoustic spatio-temporal focus at the location. It is {{shown that a}} TR focus behaves as a “virtual” source (in the far-field limit) in the outbound direction {{with respect to the}} TRM. By extension, a collection of TRM-to-probe source <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> constitutes a virtual source array (VSA) that can serve as a remote platform for active imaging methods such as beam-steering and other coherent wavefront techniques. As a demonstration, a set of a-priori <b>sampled</b> TRM-to-VSA <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> are steered to coherently focus at a selected location beyond the VSA for which the <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> is not known a-priori.

A survey of the literature of grinding and surface texture shows the influence of dressing and wear on surfaces {{involved in the process}} and the advantages of stylus profilometry for data collection from both grinding wheels and ground surfaces. Statistical analysis is favoured for surface profile characterization and, of the various parameters used, power spectral density alone offers some prospect of effective comparison between these surfaces. Work on grinding with single crystals of natural corundum was eventually discontinued in favour of experiments with conventional bonded grinding wheels subjected to a dressing operation and some wear in grinding steel surfaces. Statistical parameters representing the surfaces are computed using data obtained from profilograms. Results in terms of power spectral density are presented showing progressive improvement following upon developments in apparatus and methods which facilitated the use of larger surface profile <b>samples.</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>functions</b> are used to relate power spectra representing corresponding pairs of surfaces.

40|$|Testate amoebae {{have been}} {{extensively}} used as proxies for environmental change and palaeoclimate reconstructions in European and North American peatlands. The {{presence of these}} micro-organisms near the peat surface is generally significantly linked to the local water table depth (WTD) and therefore preservation of the amoeba shells downcore allows for water table reconstructions over millennia. In the last decades, attention for the palaeoecology of the southern Patagonian peat bogs has increased, {{partly because of the}} particular climatological setting {{under the influence of the}} southern westerlies. These atypical peat bogs are characterised by a wide range of water tables, from wet hollows to hummocks exceeding 100 cm above the water table, and a dominance of Sphagnum magellanicum on low lawns up to the highest hummocks. Here we present the first <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> for this region that allows for reliable WTD reconstructions, along with 2 k-year palaeorecords from local peat bogs. A modern dataset (155 samples) was sampled along transects from five bogs in 2012 and 2013. Measurements of WTD, pH and conductivity were taken for all <b>samples.</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>function</b> model was based on the 2012 dataset while the 2013 samples served as an independent test set to validate the model. Besides the standard leave-one- out cross-validation we applied leave-one-site-out and leave-one transect-out cross-validation, which are effective means of verifying the degree of clustering in the dataset. To assure the environmental gradient had been evenly sampled we quantified the root-mean-squared error of prediction (RMSEP) individually for segments of this gradient. Ordinations showed a clear hydrological gradient in amoeba assemblages, with the dominant Assulina muscorum at the dry end and Amphitrema wrightianum and Difflugia globulosa at the wet end. Taxa as Nebela certesi and Nebela cockayni, possibly exclusive to the southern hemisphere, were identified and their optima and tolerances were determined. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that WTD was the most important environmental variable, accounting for 18 % of the variance in amoeba assemblages. A weighted averaging-partial least squares model showed best performance in cross-validation and using the 2013 data as an independent test set. Any spatial autocorrelation was minimal although the model still appeared less effective in predicting WTD for sites not included in the training set. The segment-wise RMSEP showed that the WTD gradient was generally evenly sampled with RMSEP below 15 cm for most of the gradient, much lower than the standard deviation of the mean of all WTDs (26 cm). Preliminary results from peat cores sampled from the same peat bogs show surprisingly stable water tables over the last 2 k years in Andorra bog but more variation in nearby Tierra Australis bog. Peat accumulation rates in Andorra bog are among the highest recorded in temperate bogs with around 4 m of peat accumulated during the last 2000 year...|$|R

Determination of the energy decay time-constant in the time domain by linear fitting the power delay profile, rather than using the frequency domain quality-factor, {{has the advantage of}} being independent of the radiation efficiency of antennas used in the measurement.

40|$|Environmental reconstructions {{are limited}} {{by the quality of}} the {{original}} data from which they are derived. In situations where microfossils are poorly preserved problems may arise, both through taxonomic uncertainty and more subtly from the alteration of the death assemblage {{as a result of the}} differential robustness of species. Diatom dissolution tends to be a particular problem in saline lakes. Laboratory-based dissolution experiments on fresh, modern diatoms collected from lakes in North and South Dakota and Saskatchewan were carried out to establish the abundance and composition changes of assemblages as dissolution progressed. Analysis of experimental results demonstrates that species exhibit regular dissolution relationships and can be ranked according to susceptibility to dissolution. Changes in valve morphology for selected key taxa were categorised under scanning electron and light microscopy into 'dissolution stages'. These data provide the basis for developing dissolution indices for individual taxa and assemblages, which can be related to absolute abundance changes of diatom valves. Experimental data were applied to two separate weighted averaging (WA) <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> to predict measured dissolution parameters (such as dissolved silica) and to a salinity <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> developed from the Northern Great Plains. In the former case, models incorporating dissolution stage counting were more accurate and robust (as validated by jackknifing).

These are statistical models obtained by direct reference to data. The data are utilised to both identify the model structure and to estimate the parameters which characterise this structure. To illustrate the generic methods considered, the lecture will utilize worked examples based on both biological and non-biological data sets. Linear systems theory assumes a cause-and-effect relationship between the input and output variables. In this context, the TF is a mathematical tool that describes {{the transfer of the}} input signal to an output signal. In this lecture, attention will be restricted to multiple–input, single–output TF models, represented in terms of the backward shift operator. One advantage of such a model is its simplicity and ability to characterise the dominant model behaviour of a dynamic system. Such models are useful for classification, forecasting, control system design and other purposes. For example, by interpreting the parameter estimates in mechanistic terms, they {{can also be used to}} help improve our understanding of the physical or biological system in question. This is called a data-based mechanistic approach (e. g. Young, 1998). The lecture will compare the Response Error and Equation Error approaches to parameter estimation, before using a worked example to develop the Normal Equations for Least Squares analysis. The limitations of this solution will be discussed, followed by consideration of alternatives and extensions, such as instrumental variables (Young, 1984) and prediction error minimization.

40|$|Recently, {{instruments}} {{became available}} on the market that provide the possibility to perform eddy covariance flux measurements of CH 4 and many other trace gases, including the traditional CO 2 and H 2 O. Most of these instruments employ laser spectroscopy, where a cross-sensitivity to H 2 O is frequently observed leading to an increased dilution effect. Additionally, sorption processes at the intake tube walls modify and delay the observed H 2 O signal in closed-path systems more strongly than the signal of the sampled trace gas. Thereby, a phase shift between the trace gas and H 2 O fluctuations is introduced that dampens the H 2 O flux observed in the sampling cell. For instruments that do not provide direct H 2 O measurement in the <b>sampling</b> cell, <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> from externally measured H 2 O fluxes are needed to estimate the effect of H 2 O on trace gas flux measurements. The effects of cross-sensitivity and the damping are shown for an eddy covariance setup with the Fast Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (FGGA, Los Gatos Research Inc.) that measures CO 2, CH 4, and H 2 O fluxes. This instrument is technically identical with the Fast Methane Analyzer (FMA, Los Gatos Research Inc.) that does not measure H 2 O concentrations. Hence, we used measurements from a FGGA to derive a modified correction for the FMA accounting for dilution as well as phase shift effects in our instrumental setup. With our specific setup for eddy covariance flux measurements, the cross-sensitivity counteracts the damping effects, which compensate each other. Hence, the new correction only deviates very slightly from the traditional Webb, Pearman, and Leuning density correction, which is calculated from separate measurements of the atmospheric water vapor flux...|$|R

Though they have not received widespread attention, multi-dimensional <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> are a very effective way to extract materials and their boundaries for both scalar and multivariate data. However, identifying good <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> is difficult enough in one dimension, let alone two or three dimensions. This paper demonstrates an important class of three-dimensional <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> for scalar data, and describes the application of multi-dimensional <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> to multivariate data. We present a set of direct manipulation widgets that make specifying such <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> intuitive and convenient. We also describe how to use modern graphics hardware to both interactively render with multi-dimensional <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> and to provide interactive shadows for volumes. The <b>transfer</b> <b>functions,</b> widgets, and hardware combine to form a powerful system for interactive volume exploration...|$|R
50|$|The {{two-dimensional}} optical <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> at {{the focal}} plane {{can be calculated}} by integration of the 3D optical <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> along the z-axis. Although the 3D <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> of the wide-field microscope (b) is zero on the z-axis for z≠0; its integral, the 2D optical transfer, reaching a maximum at x=y=0. This is only possible because the 3D optical <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> diverges at the origin x=y=z=0. The function values along the z-axis of the 3D optical <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> correspond to the Dirac delta function.|$|R
