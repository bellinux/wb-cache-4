50|$|Additional to the {{traditional}} screw contacts the electrical connection between the module {{and other parts of}} the power electronic system can also be achieved by pin contacts (soldered onto a PCB), press-fit contacts pressed into PCB vias, <b>spring</b> <b>contacts</b> that inherently press on contact areas of a PCB or by pure pressure contact where corrosion-proof surface areas are directly pressed together.Press-fit pins achieve a very high reliability and ease the mounting process without the need for soldering. Compared to press-fit connections, <b>spring</b> <b>contacts</b> have the benefit of allowing easy and non-destructive removal of the connection several times, as for inspection or replacement of an module, for instance. Both contact types have rather limited current-carrying capability due to their comparatively low cross-sectional area and small contact surface. Therefore, modules often contain multiple pins or springs for each of the electrical power connections.|$|R
50|$|Air core {{inductors}} can use {{sliding contacts}} or multiple taps to {{increase or decrease}} the number of turns included in the circuit, to change the inductance. A type much {{used in the past}} but mostly obsolete today has a <b>spring</b> <b>contact</b> that can slide along the bare surface of the windings. The disadvantage of this type is that the contact usually short-circuits one or more turns. These turns act like a single-turn short-circuited transformer secondary winding; the large currents induced in them cause power losses.|$|E
50|$|Fixed {{contacts}} are inexpensive but {{prone to}} loss of electrical connection. Combination of fixed and flexible contacts are a better solution, {{but this is}} subject to an open circuit upon movement in the direction away from the fixed position; the <b>spring</b> <b>contact</b> compresses and allows the battery {{to move away from}} the fixed contact. A flexible contact allows for slight expansion of the cell on discharge, as internal chemicals increase in volume. Flexible contacts with multiple fingers touching the anode and cathode allow for movement in multiple directions without losing electrical connection.|$|E

50|$|The main {{operator}} control units, of these plans, appeared {{similar to a}} 232 plus Bellset 26 combo but was now a Tele 248 plus Bellset 39a (early versions) or 44 (later). These bellsets had a recess, in the front, dominated by a horizontal, quadrant mounted, 4 position slider, flanked by either 1 or 2 press buttons, for buzzing the extension(s). These Bellsets 39a and 44 were bellsets in name only, as they contained no bell. What they did contain was a maze of <b>spring</b> <b>contact</b> sets, mainly activated by a cam at the pivot of the slide switch. The system required a separate, remote mounted bellset, for incoming signalling. The main unit could make and answer exchange calls, talk to and transfer calls to the extension(s). The extensions could call and {{talk to each other}} and the main unit, but could only make external calls if a request to the operator, for the exchange line, was honoured.When this system was eventually revisited and brought up to date, with the 700 series Plans 105 and 107, the equivalent control unit was dubbed 'The Planset'.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, novel dry-contact sensors for {{measuring}} electro-encephalography (EEG) signals without any skin preparation are designed, fabricated by an injection molding manufacturing process and experimentally validated. Conventional wet electrodes {{are commonly used}} to measure EEG signals; they provide excellent EEG signals subject to proper skin preparation and conductive gel application. However, a series of skin preparation procedures for applying the wet electrodes is always required and usually creates trouble for users. To overcome these drawbacks, novel dry-contact EEG sensors were proposed for potential operation in {{the presence or absence}} of hair and without any skin preparation or conductive gel usage. The dry EEG sensors were designed to contact the scalp surface with 17 <b>spring</b> <b>contact</b> probes. Each probe was designed to include a probe head, plunger, spring, and barrel. The 17 probes were inserted into a flexible substrate using a one-time forming process via an established injection molding procedure. With these 17 <b>spring</b> <b>contact</b> probes, the flexible substrate allows for high geometric conformity between the sensor and the irregular scalp surface to maintain low skin-sensor interface impedance. Additionally, the flexible substrate also initiates a sensor buffer effect, eliminating pain when force is applied. The proposed dry EEG sensor was reliable in measuring EEG signals without any skin preparation or conductive gel usage, as compared with the conventional wet electrodes...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} compute stiffness matrices for compliant grasps and fixtures. While the linear <b>spring</b> <b>contact</b> model has been widely used by robotics researchers, it is in general not accurate for practical applications.

We derive a stiffness matrix formula that considers surface and material properties of the contacting bodies and applies to both planar and solid grasps. The effects of contact geometry are analyzed and illustrated with examples. 1 Introduction This paper addresses the computation of stiffness matrices for compliant grasps and fixtures. Our method can incorporate quite general models of compliance, including the well known Hertz contact model, and takes the curvatures of the contacting bodies into account. The resulting stiffness matrices should be generally applicable to automated fixture and grasp planning. For the sake of convenience, the ge [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this work is to {{calculate}} the T (transition) matrix for a circular crack in a homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic medium. The T matrix method is a building block technique for multiple scattering, where the T matrix is calculated for each scatterer separately without prior knowledge of the other scatterers (cracks, inclusions, surfaces, etc.). This means that we solve the scattering problem for arbitrary incoming time harmonic elastic waves. A solution for the scattering by an open circular crack {{can be found in}} [1], and for multiple scattering see [2]. On the crack surface the so called <b>spring</b> <b>contact</b> boundary conditions are assumed, enabling modelling of various cracktypes, such as the open crack, the fluid filled crack and a crack partly closed by a static background pressure. Numerical calculations of the scattering cross sections and the crack-scattered farfield amplitudes for incoming plane waves are given...|$|E
40|$|In (hand) tips- grasping, {{an object}} is {{constrained}} by multiple tips of fingers which apply forces to an object. The IPC grasping controller introduced in [2], gives a physi-cally based methodology to implement an Intrinsically Passive Control (IPC) strategy {{in order to}} grasp with either a multi finger hand or manipulation with multiple arms. This strategy has been successfully implemented and extended in different applications as also reported in [4]. The idea which is schematically reported in Fig. 1, {{is based on a}} (virtual) physically inspired controller composed of a number of geometric <b>springs</b> (<b>contact</b> <b>springs)</b> connecting the tips of the fingers of the hand (or the end of the multi limb system) to a virtual object. This virtual object is by itself connected to a new spring which can be used to move the all ensemble around. The goal of the virtual object is to create damping injection in the system in order to achieve a proper be-haviour. The grasping is obtained by changing the lengths of the <b>contact</b> <b>springs</b> once the tips are positioned around the objects to be grasped. Changing the lengths of the springs in a geometrical consistent way, can be done as explained in [3]...|$|R

50|$|A normal {{integrated}} circuit (IC) socket requires the IC {{to be pushed}} into <b>sprung</b> <b>contacts</b> which then grip by friction. For an IC with hundreds of pins, the total insertion force can be very large (hundreds of newtons), leading to a danger of damage to the device or the circuit board. Also, even with relatively small pin counts, each pin extraction is fairly awkward and carries a significant risk of bending pins, particularly if the person performing the extraction hasn't had much practice or if the board is crowded. Low insertion force (LIF) sockets reduce the issues of insertion and extraction, but because of its lower insertion force than a conventional socket, are likely to produce less reliable connections.|$|R
