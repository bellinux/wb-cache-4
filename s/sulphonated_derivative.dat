Structural and dynamic properties of molecular dynamics trajectories of these Pcs in solution were evaluated. The hydration shells of the Pcs were defined by means of spheroids adapted to the solute shape. Structural analysis of the axial region compared to the peripheral region indicates {{that there are no}} significant changes among the different macrocycles, but that of [CuPc(SO 3) 4] 4 −, where the polyoxoanion presence induces a typically hydrophilic hydration structure. The analyzed water dynamic properties cover mean residence times, translational and orientational diffusion coefficients, and hydrogen bond network. These properties allow a thorough discussion about the simultaneous existence of hydrophobic and hydrophilic hydration in these macrocycles, and indicate the trend of water structure to well define shells in the environment of hydrophobic solutes. The comparison between the structural and dynamical analysis of the hydration of the amphipathic [CuPc(SO 3) 4] 4 − and the non-soluble Cu–Pc shows a very weak coupling among the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments of the macrocycle. Quantitative results are employed to revisit the iceberg model proposed by Frank and Evans, leading to conclude that structure and dy- namics support a non-strict interpretation of the iceberg view, although the qualitative trends pointed out by the model are supported.

OPBI and SOPBI membranes with good chemical stability were prepared by casting from their dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) solution and then impregnated in phosphoric acid baths to obtain H(3) PO(4) (PA) -doped membranes. The properties of PA-doped OPBI membranes, including phosphoric acid uptake, swelling ratio, mechanical properties and thermal properties, were fully investigated and compared with PA-doped SOPBI membranes. The fuel cell performances of PA-doped OPBI and SOPBI membranes at different temperatures were first evaluated. When doped in different concentrations of H(3) PO(4) solution, OPBI membranes adsorb more acid than SOPBI membranes. SOPBI membranes exhibit obviously lower swelling ratio in thickness direction {{than that of}} OPBI membranes. With an acid uptake of similar to 110 wt. %, corresponding doping level around 5, PA-doped OPBI and SOPBI membranes keep reasonably high tensile strength.

In all cases well-defined crystalline materials, containing hydrogen-bonded networks with quasi-hexagonal sheet lattices were formed. However, the unsubstituted sulphonate (1) formed a 1 : 1 guanidinium:sulphonate bilayer structure, whilst the unsubstituted phosphonate (2) and arsonate (3) formed 2 : 1 guanidinium: phosphonate/arsonate single-layer structures with water occluded within the crystal voids.

In the case of the nitro-substituted <b>sulphonate</b> <b>derivatives,</b> the 1 : 1 bilayer structure of the parent (1) was retained for the 3 - nitrobenzenesulphonate (4), but transformed to a 1 : 1 single-layer system for the 4 -nitrobenzenesulphonate (6).

The greater complexity of the P/As (- 2) structures compared to the S (- 1) structure is attributed to the higher charge on the former anions providing additional opportunities for H-bonding.

40|$|The {{problem of}} relying solely on in vitro data to predict {{photosensitiser}} efficacy was demonstrated {{by examining the}} uptake {{and the ability to}} mediate photocytotoxicity of mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-sulphonated species of chloroaluminium phthalocyanine (AlS 1 - 4 Pc) in monolayer cultures of murine Colo 26 cells and in both monolayer and spheroid cultures of human WiDr cells. Cells treated in vitro, whether in monolayer or as spheroids, with the less <b>sulphonated</b> <b>derivatives,</b> AlS 1 Pc and AlS 2 Pc, were more susceptible to photocytotoxicity than those treated with AlS 3 Pc, cells treated with AlS 4 Pc were even less susceptibile to the cytotoxic effects of light irradiation. Generally these results mirrored the cellular uptake in vitro. When WiDr spheroids were increased in size from 250 microns to 500 microns there was a reduction in uptake of AlS 1 Pc and AlS 2 Pc which was reflected by the decreased sensitivity of the larger spheroids to the effects of light irradiation. AlS 1 Pc had no effect against Colo 26 cells growing as s. c. tumours in syngeneic BALB/c mice; whereas AlS 3 Pc, AlS 2 Pc and AlS 4 Pc produced significant reductions in tumour weights 5 days post laser light irradiation. Of these, AlS 2 Pc had the most dramatic effect on the colony forming efficiency of tumour cells recovered 24 h after PDT. While, despite their effects on tumour size, AlS 3 Pc and AlS 4 Pc scarcely affected the subsequent viability of cells from dissociated tumours.

40|$|Summary The {{ability to}} detect photosensitisers in tissue at a microscopical level is {{important}} when studying photodynamic therapy (PDT) in both normal and malignant tissue. We have studied the fluorescence distribution of aluminium sulphonated phthalocyanine (AlSPc) in the normal rat bladder using a cooled CCD (charge coupled device) imaging system with computerised image processing. This system {{makes it possible to}} carry out a quantitative assessment of photosensitiser fluorescence in the various layers of the bladder wall. The highest fluorescence intensities were obtained within I h of intravenous administration but there was little selectivity of uptake between layers. AlSPc was eliminated from the deeper muscle layers more quickly than from the superficial layers of the bladder wall so that by 24 h a 4 : 1 ratio of fluorescence intensity was apparent which persisted at least until 72 h, although the absolute amount of photosensitiser declined. Following irradiation by red light (675 nm), photobleaching of the sensitiser in the deeper layers further increased this ratio. Direct absorption of AlSPc by the bladder wall following intravesical administration proved unreliable. The use of phthalocyanines, and in particular the aluminium <b>sulphonated</b> <b>derivatives,</b> as experimental photosensitisers for photodynamic therapy (PDT) is developing rapidly. These substances have several advantages over haematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) in terms of chemical purity and stability, and a major absorption peak in the red part of the spectrum (675 nm) where there is better tissue penetration.

40|$|Water {{is unique}} among liquids {{for its ability}} for {{tetrahedral}} coordination with four neighbouring molecules. Water catalyzed reactions (or spontaneous reactions) are pH independent hydrolytic processes that involve the transfer of one or several protons to or from water molecules in the transition state (TS) of the rate determining step. Indeed, in these reactions one water molecule acts as a nucleophile while one or several act as general bases, and typically show a) high negative values of entropy of activation (∆S ≠), and b) high kinetic solvent isotope effect (KSIE). In these reactions water is solvent, nucleophile and catalyst. The hydrolyses of alkyl halides, alkyl and aryl <b>sulphonates,</b> and <b>derivatives</b> of carboxylic acids (esters, amides) have been extensively studied. The reaction with derivatives of saturated carbons is quite different than the hydrolyses of esters and amides. At least two water molecules must be strongly bound at the TS to produce a high KSIE, restricting the number of possible positions of these molecules. The number of molecules involved in the proton transfer (two molecules per proton) can be determined by proton inventory.

The water-soluble phthalocyanines employed include zinc tetrasulphophthalocyanine (ZnPcS[subscript 4]), zinc octacarboxyphthalocyanine (ZnPc(COOH) [subscript 8]) and a sulphonated ZnPc containing a mixture of differently <b>sulphonated</b> <b>derivatives</b> (ZnPcS[subscript mix]), while the water-insoluble phthalocyanines used include unsubstituted magnesium (MgPc), zinc (ZnPc) and chloroaluminium (ClAlPc) phthalocyanine complexes and the ring-substituted zinc tetranitro (ZnPc(NO[subscript 2]) [subscript 4]), zinc tetraamino (ZnPc(NH[subscript 2]) [subscript 4]), zinc hexadecafluoro (ZnPcF[subscript 16]) and zinc hexadecachloro (ZnPcCl[subscript 16]) phthalocyanines. The most effective water-soluble photocatalyst is ZnPcS[subscript mix] in terms of the high quantum yield obtained for 4 -Np degradation (Φ[subscript 4 -Np]) as well as its photostability. While ZnPc(COOH) [subscript 8] has the highest Φ[subscript 4 -Np] value relative to the other water-soluble complexes, it degrades readily during photocatalysis. The Φ[subscript 4 -Np] values were closely related to the singlet oxygen quantum yields Φ[subscript Δ] and hence aggregation. The rate constants for the reaction with 4 -Np were kr = 0. 67 x 10 [superscript 6] mol[superscript - 1] dm[superscript 3] s[superscript - 1] for ZnPcS[subscript mix] and 7. 7 x 10 [superscript 6] mol[superscript - 1] dm[superscript 3] s[superscript - 1] for ZnPc(COOH) [subscript 8]. ClAlPc is the most effective photocatalyst relative to the other heterogeneous photocatalysts for the phototransformation of 4 -Np, with 89 ± 8. 4 % degradation of 4 -Np achieved after 100 min. The least effective catalysts were ZnPcCl[subscript 16] and MgPc. The final products of the photocatalysis of 4 -Np in {{the presence}} of the homogeneous photocatalysts include 4 -nitrocatechol and hydroquinone, while degradation of 4 -Np {{in the presence}} of the heterogeneous photocatalysts resulted in fumaric acid and 4 -nitrocatechol. ClAlPc was employed for the heterogeneous photocatalysis of the non-systemic insecticide, methyl paraoxon. Complete degradation of the pesticide was confirmed by the disappearance of the HPLC trace for methyl paraoxon after 100 min of irradiation with visible light. The removal of 4 -Np from an aqueous medium using commercially available Amberlite[superscript ®] IRA- 900 modified with metal phthalocyanines was also investigated. The metallophthalocyanines immobilised onto the surface of Amberlite[superscript ®] IRA- 900 include Fe (FePcS[subscript 4]), Co (CoPcS[subscript 4]) and Ni (NiPcS[subscript 4]) tetrasulphophthalocyanines, and differently sulphonated phthalocyanine mixtures of Fe (FePcS[subscript mix]), Co (CoPcS[subscript mix]) and Ni (NiPcS[subscript mix]). Adsorption rates were fastest for the modified adsorbents at pH 9. Using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model, the complexes showed the following order of 4 -Np adsorption: CoPcS[subscript mix] > NiPcS[subscript 4] > NiPcS[subscript mix] > FePcS[subscript 4] > FePcS[subscript mix] > CoPcS[subscript 4].

The novel agent PRO 2000, a naphthalene <b>sulphonate</b> <b>derivative</b> with in vitro activity against HIV and other sexually transmissible pathogens, is one such compound. We have studied the local and systemic safety and tolerance of a vaginal gel formulation of this agent at two concentrations (0. 5 % and 4 %) over a 2 week period of daily exposure in two cohorts of healthy sexually abstinent women (one in London, UK, and the other in Antwerp, Belgium). METHODS: This was a randomised, placebo controlled, double blind, three arm clinical trial conducted on two sites. Macroscopic evidence of genital epithelial changes was sought using colposcopy and evidence of microscopic inflammation was acquired using high vaginal biopsy from predetermined sites (UK cohort only). Blood levels of PRO 2000 were measured and laboratory safety tests, including coagulation screens, were performed. The impact on vaginal ecology was also assessed. RESULTS: 73 women were enrolled across both sites (36 UK, 37 Belgium); 24, 24, 25 in the 4 %, 0. 5 %, and placebo groups respectively. Of these, 70 completed 2 weeks' exposure to the study gel. Three (all in the 4 % group) withdrew owing to adverse events which were possibly or probably gel related. Cervicovaginal abrasion was seen colposcopically in three subjects after 14 days of gel use (two in the 4 % group and one in the placebo group). Genital ulceration was not seen during gel use in any of the subjects who completed the study. Histological evaluation of vaginal biopsy samples (36 women only) showed evidence of increased inflammatory signs in one participant of the 4. 0 % group. One volunteer in the placebo group had moderate inflammation at screening and at follow up. Severe inflammation was not seen among any of the subjects tested. Plasma levels of PRO 2000 and laboratory safety tests showed no evidence of systemic absorption. No impact was seen on normal vaginal ecology in the UK cohort where samples were taken 12 hours after the last gel application. CONCLUSION: In this phase I study PRO 2000 gel was found to be generally well tolerated with promising local and systemic safety profiles. The 0. 5 % gel was better tolerated than the 4 % gel as fewer genital epithelial adverse events were seen in the former. Phase II studies are about to begin in sexually active women...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop the use of {{fluorescent}} probes for studying structural changes in biochemical systems. The investigation {{was carried out in}} two major ways:- 	 chromophoric molecules with different structures and fluorescence 	properties were used in an attempt to discover the structural 	characteristics needed to make a fluorescent molecule behave 	as a probe. 	 biochemical systems of differing complexity were studied using 	ANS (1 -anilino-naphthalene- 8 -sulphonate) and other probes to see 	what sort of information this probe technique could give. The 	two main biochemical systems used were:- (i) the ligand induced 	conformational change of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and, 	(ii) energy dependent structural changes in submitochondrial 	particles (SMP). (i. e. those changes induced in mitochondrial 	membrane fragments by oxidisable substrate which could be 	reversed by uncoupling agents). a) MNS (2 -(N-methyl anilino) -naphthalene- 6 -sulphonate) and MNS-Cl were synthesised in an attempt to label GDH covalently with an ANS type molecule. MNS was shown to behave {{in the same way as}} ANS, but with a larger blue shift of fluorescence on binding, and a larger enhancement accompanying the conformational change (3 fold instead of 2 fold). MNS-Cl denatured the enzyme even under mild conditions of modification. A variety of dansyl (l-dimethylamino-naphthalene- 5 -sulphonyl) amino acids were used to probe the conformational change of GDH. The dansyl derivatives of glutamate and inhibitors of the enzyme had their fluorescence quenched by NADH + GTP. In contrast the dansyl derivatives of the monocarboxylic amino acids (whose oxidation is activated by the conformational change) had their fluorescence enhanced by NADH + GTP. Despite this specificity there were large numbers of dansyl amino acid binding sites on GDH (ca 35 per oligomer). Comparison of these responses with those of the MNS-amides showed that in order to detect the structural change in GDH, a probe needed to be negatively charged and to have the negative charge close to the aromatic part of the probe. In order to detect energy dependent changes in SMP a probe again needed to be negatively charged. However, in this case the negative charge did not have to be as close to the aromatic part of the probe as with the GDH system. Neutral, non-polar probes bind in the lipid phase of the membrane where they cannot sense energy dependent changes in SMP or ionic strength changes in erythrocyte stroma. The negative charge is important in directing the probe to the area of the membrane where it can sense structural changes. In order to test what type of negative charge was required, three 9 -anilino acridine derivatives with different acidic groups in the aniline ring were synthesised. Only the <b>sulphonate</b> <b>derivative</b> responded to energy dependent changes in SMP, indicating a preference for this group rather than carboxylate or arsonate. b) (i) A limited amount of information was obtained concerning GDH. L-Glu enhanced the fluorescence of bound NADH, while D-Glu had no effect and andalpha;Kg was a potent quencher. These sharp differences are difficult to explain since all three molecules bind at the same site on GDH. andalpha;Kg also shifted the conformational equilibrium, making GTP much more effective at inducing the conformational change. The reason for this is as yet unclear. (ii) The responses of the polarity sensitive probes ANS and MNS, and of the excimer forming probe PS (pyrene- 3 -sulphonate) to the energy dependent changes in SMP were studied and compared. ANS and MNS bound rapidly to the membrane surface and slowly diffused to internal sites. The energy dependent response was a property of the internal sites only. On binding to SMP no excimer formation by PS was detectable. However, on energisation excimer fluorescence appeared, accompanied by a decrease in monomer fluorescence. This must be due to either an increase in PS concentration within the membrane or to decreased viscosity. Comparison of the rates of fluorescence decrease following uncoupling revealed a common fast phase (t andfrac 12; = 2 sec) with a slow phase characteristic of each probe (t andfrac 12; = 12 (ANS), 30 (PS), 60 (MNS) secs). The rates of the slow phases of ANS and PS correlated well with those measured for probe efflux by independent methods. This suggested that the fast phase was a rapid membrane change, followed by a efflux of probe from the membrane (slow phase). Binding parameters for ANS and MNS were measured by conventional fluorescence techniques. There was an increase in binding and in quantum yield of bound ANS and MNS on energisation of SMP. A novel filtration method was developed for measuring PS binding and showed a two fold increase in PS bound to SMP after energisation. However, this increase was not large enough to account for the observed excimer fluorescence. The technique was also used to verify the fluorescence results for ANS binding. By measuring fluorescence polarisation and life-times of ANS and MNS in resting and energised SMP, it was possible to rule out viscosity changes as a cause of the PS fluorescence changes. It was therefore proposed that all the probe effects could be explained if energisation involved expulsion of water from the membrane. This hypothesis was tested by examining the energy dependent responses of ANS and MNS in D 2 O and H 2 O. in free solution D 2 O quenches ANS (and MNS) fluorescence less than H 2 O giving an isotope effect of 2. 8 (2. 4). This effect was lowered for both probes on binding to SMP. On energisation, there was a further lowering of the isotope effect on MNS. This suggested that the internal sites at which ANS and MNS bind are partially excluded from water and that on energisation this exclusion increases. By comparing ANS with NPN (N-phenyl- 1 -naphthylamine) and other neutral probes, it was shown that the probe binding sites are close to the membrane protein, and are probably at interfaces between hydrophobic and aqueous regions within the membrane, i. e. in an area where the probe could easily sense water exclusion. A theory of the energised state of SMP was proposed, based on the suggestion that energisation involves water expulsion. The theory accounted for the observed probe responses, as well as for proton uptake, and provided a driving force for phosphorylation. One probe ABS (2 -methoxy, 6 -chloro, 9 -acridinyl-p-amino benzene sulphonate) had an electron transport dependent response (as well as an energy dependent one), which appeared to follow the rate of oxidation of coenzyme Q. </p...|$|R
