50|$|The Group’s {{principal}} {{assets are}} four hard-rock gold mines in the Amur region, Russian Far East. All four mines are open pit and gold is processed on-site utilising conventional resin-in-pulp (“RIP”) processing plants and/or heap-leaching operations. Acquired as either greenfield or early-stage exploration sites, the mines were developed and commissioned in-house by the Group, utilising its specialist exploration, engineering and construction teams and its {{research and development}} centres and laboratories. As the group’s mining assets are all located in Russia, the group’s operations are run in accordance with Russian environmental, labour and health and safety laws. As a consequence, the group has a good environmental management and <b>safety</b> <b>track</b> record compared to some of its peers in the mining sector. In order to provide greater transparency to its international shareholders and stakeholders, the Group {{in recent years has}} sought to align its policies and procedures with international best practice.|$|E
50|$|All battery {{locomotives}} are {{fitted with}} tripcocks which are operated by trackside equipment if the train passes a signal at danger. Eighteen (L15 - L21 and L44 - L54) are also fitted with Central line Automatic Train Protection (ATP). When they were built, locomotives L25 to L32 were fitted with Automatic Train Operation (ATO) equipment, which {{allowed them to}} work on the Victoria line. The tripcock could be isolated, and a trip valve performed a similar function, except that it was operated by the ATO controller. A special setting was provided that allowed the vehicles to move if they were not receiving <b>safety</b> <b>track</b> signals, but the maximum speed in these circumstances was limited to 10 mph. By the mid-1980s, this equipment had ceased to be used, as works trains were only run on the Victoria line when engineers had possession of the whole line. Subsequently, some locomotives (L27 - L32) have been fitted with a new type of Victoria line ATP equipment which was designed by Metronet BCV on behalf of Transplant, the operator of the fleet. This system was installed during 2007 at Ruislip Depot. It is compatible with the new Distance-to-Go Radio (DTG-R) ATP system which has been implemented on the Victoria line by Westinghouse Rail Systems.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{accidents}} involving downgrade runaway trains {{in the late}} 1880s, the then Southern Railway built two runaway safety spur tracks. These were originally manned junctions, which were always switched to a 60 ft pile of earth, which could stop downgrade runaway trains. Only upon hearing a whistle signal from the downgrade train would the signalman manning the spur junction throw the switch to keep the train on the main line. In later years, CTC signaling was installed along with automated switches and timer circuits for the one surviving runaway <b>safety</b> <b>track</b> {{at the bottom of}} the grade at Melrose. Trains running downgrade were required to maintain 8 mph when approaching the runaway track switch. This would allow a timer circuit to determine if a train was under control, in which case the switch from the runaway track at Melrose would be aligned to the mainline. But for speed greater than 8 mph the switch would remain aligned for the runaway track. Saluda Grade was one of the few grades in the country where uphill trains could travel faster than their downhill counterparts. Most uphill trains had to double or triple the grade, splitting the train into sections to be taken up the grade to Saluda one at a time and reassembled there for the rest of the trip to Asheville.|$|E

5000|$|When {{it comes}} to child welfare, all {{interested}} parties say they want {{what is in the}} best interest of children. The debate stems from what programs actually are in the best interest of the children. Family preservation advocates believe that children are safest and they receive the best outcome when kept in the care of their parents. They support providing in home services for at risk families that range from financial help to parenting classes. Proponents want to take the child out of the house and into the foster system so the child can eventually find permanent placement. They support that government financial aid goes toward foster care and placement programs. The most prominent debate over family preservation is child safety. Opponents of family preservation believe that it leaves the child in danger by leaving them in the home. They use extreme cases, such as those reported in the media in an attempt to polarize child safety and family preservation. Family preservation is in definition and practice an attempt to keep children safe. The National Coalition for Child Protection Reform NCCPR defines family preservation as a [...] "systematic determination of those families in which children could remain in their homes or be returned home safely, and provision of the services needed to ensure that safety." [...] They find real family preservation programs to have a better <b>safety</b> <b>track</b> record than foster care. Their studies were based on larger segments of the population and included control groups, leaving them much more reliable and generalizable than the horrific case studies used by opponents.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} {{high-speed}} railway bridges comprises {{a set of}} demands, from safety and serviceability aspects, to new types of equipment and construction solutions. In order to perform an accurate and realistic evaluation of the corresponding dynamic behavior, adequate analysis tools that {{take into account the}} complexity of the train-bridge system are required. These computational tools must be based on efficient algorithms to allow for the completion of detailed dynamic analyses in a reasonable amount of time. The classical methods of analysis may be unsatisfactory in the evaluation of the dynamic effects of the train-bridge system and fully assessment of the structural <b>safety,</b> <b>track</b> safety and passenger comfort.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{highlight}} the effects of bodies flexibility concerning the Running Dynamics requirements and the Structural requirements and how such aspects could {{be taken into account}} in an integrated design process focused on the optimization of the vehicle design in terms of Comfort, <b>Safety,</b> <b>Track</b> fatigue and Bogie frame design. A simplified multi-body system of the vehicle has been developed utilizing the software SIMPACK and thanks to the interaction between SIMPACK module, FEMBS, and the commercial finite element softwares (e. g. I-DEAS as pre and post-processor and MSC NASTRAN as solver), the flexible bodies, as carbody, wheelset, bolster-beam and bogie-frame, have been implemented. In the integration process of the flexible body into a multi-body system, a critical step is the reduction of the finite element model of the body to decrease the computational burden. For such reason an analytical verification, in order to validate the reduced FE-model with respect to the full FE-model, has been planned and implemented to provide the company with a powerful and useful design tool...|$|E
40|$|The actual European {{regulations}} for {{the acceptance of}} railway vehicles prescribe the measurement of not only accelerations but also contact forces exchanged at wheel-rail interface, {{in order to assess}} the level of running <b>safety,</b> <b>track</b> loading and vibration behaviour. It is {{important to point out that}} the standards do not prescribe any specific method to measure forces, or define the measurement of forces. The aim of this paper is to investigate the metrological properties of a dynamometric wheelset in order to determine the associated measurement uncertainty and to verify its readiness in the range of frequencies where the force analysis must be performed. With reference to a specific instrumented wheelset, a method for increasing the accuracy of the measure when critical running conditions (i. e. large values of the derailment coefficient Y/Q) are detected is proposed. The proposed method can be applied to any instrumented wheelset, but it is particularly effective on non-conventional wheelsets, where only few measurements are available and the classical methods cause large estimation errors...|$|E

A variation of the method of multipliers is presented for performing the constrained function minimization.
