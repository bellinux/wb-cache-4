5|$|An {{experiment}} by the Australian zoologist A.D. Blest {{demonstrated that}} the more an eyespot resembled a real vertebrate eye in both colour and pattern, the more effective it was in <b>scaring</b> off insectivorous birds. In another experiment using peacock butterflies, Blest showed that when the conspicuous eyespots had been rubbed off, insectivorous birds (yellow buntings) were much less effectively frightened off, and therefore both the sudden appearance of colour, and the actual eyespot pattern, contribute {{to the effectiveness of}} the deimatic display.|$|E

40|$|Background : A {{substantial}} number of young women experience pregnancy <b>scares</b> - thinking they might be pregnant, and later discovering that they are not. Although pregnancy <b>scares</b> are distressing events, {{little is known about}} who experiences them and whether they are important to our understanding of unintended pregnancy. Objective : We describe the young women who experience pregnancy <b>scares,</b> and examine the link between pregnancy <b>scares</b> and subsequent unintended pregnancy. Methods : We used data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life Study. T-tests and regression analyses were conducted using baseline and weekly data to estimate relationships between respondent characteristics and subsequent pregnancy <b>scares.</b> Event history methods were used to assess pregnancy <b>scares</b> as a predictor of unintended pregnancy. Results : Nine percent of the young women experienced a pregnancy <b>scare</b> during the study. African-American race, lack of two-parent family structure, lower GPA, cohabitation, and sex without birth control prior to the study are associated with experiencing a pregnancy <b>scare</b> and with experiencing a greater number of pregnancy <b>scares.</b> Further, experiencing a pregnancy <b>scare</b> is strongly associated with subsequent unintended pregnancy, independent of background factors. Forty percent of the women who experienced a pregnancy <b>scare</b> subsequently had an unintended pregnancy during the study period, relative to only 11 Å  of those who did not experience a pregnancy <b>scare.</b> Conclusions : Young women from less advantaged backgrounds are more likely to experience a pregnancy <b>scare,</b> and pregnancy <b>scares</b> are often followed by an unintended pregnancy...|$|R

5|$|When {{you throw}} a {{cat in the}} oven, it's easy to have someone in the {{orchestra}} slam a hammer down on an anvil, <b>scaring</b> {{the hell out of}} everyone.

5|$|While the {{majority}} of the meerkats filmed were partially habituated, the cinematographers had to move carefully to avoid <b>scaring</b> the animals. The crew used radios to keep in contact with one another as they followed the meerkat groups around. Although the park normally prohibits low-flying aircraft, the production crew was given permission to film for three days using a low-flying helicopter. Mounted to its front underside was a new type of camera that was not affected by the shaking of the helicopter. Full-color scenes depicting the birth of meerkat pups were obtained by filming captive meerkats at the Cotswold Wildlife Park in the United Kingdom.|$|E
