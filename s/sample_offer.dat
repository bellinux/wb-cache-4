40|$|Data {{revisions}} and {{the availability}} of a longer <b>sample</b> <b>offer</b> the opportunity to reconsider empirical findings that suggest that in the OECD countries national saving responds non-monotonically to fiscal policy. The paper confirms that the circumstance most likely to give rise to a non-monotonic response of national saving to a fiscal impulse is a "large and persistent impulse," defined as one in which the full employment surplus, as a percentage of potential output, changes by at least 1. 5 percentage points per year over a two-year period. This particular circumstance remains the only statistically significant one even when we allow for non-monotonic responses to arise when public debt is growing rapidly or interest rate spreads are widening. We find that non-monotonic responses are similar for fiscal contractions and expansions. In particular, an increase in net taxes has no effect on national saving during large fiscal contractions or expansions. For government consumption there is a large, albeit in some specifications less than complete, offset during expansions or contractions. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the monetary benefits available in the context of long-term care provided by family or other informal carers in 11 old and 10 new EU member states. All but one country in our <b>sample</b> <b>offer</b> at least some monetary benefits {{that can be used to}} help finance informal care. Old EU member states tend to direct benefits to individuals in need of care, whereas new EU member states place more emphasis on benefits for carers. Among new EU member states, monetary benefits are less often means-tested and tend to be lower compared with benefits in old EU member states. Because social policies in many countries increasingly rely on monetary benefits rather than on benefits in kind and because the share of informal care in the overall provision of elderly care will scarcely decline, monetary benefit incentives for labour market participation need to be carefully monitored.

The method, termed joint sampling, {{is based on}} sampling from the structural alignment space of the sequences, i. e. the space of joint representations of common secondary structures and sequence alignments of the sequences. The structural alignment space is efficiently sampled by probabilistically generating structural alignments from building blocks termed structural alignment atoms.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the pricing of a {{specific}} service of currency exchange based on the retail exchange rate spreads is studied on the example of four international banking groups. The {{aim of this study}} is to explore pricing of currency exchange services based on bid-ask differences in some commercial banks and possible price discrimination in this segment of market comparing the behaviour of Western mothers and Eastern daughters in European international banking groups. The retail currency rate spreads in different bank groups and countries are compared with each other. The main results of the study are that statistically significant differences exist in the spreads set by banking groups in different countries. All banking groups in the pilot <b>sample</b> <b>offer</b> more favourable rates in Western countries indicating that the pricing policy of bank groups may be discriminatory.

40|$|Stellar-mass {{black holes}} in the low-hard state may hold clues to jet {{formation}} and basic accretion disk physics, but {{the nature of the}} accretion flow remains uncertain. A standard thin disk can extend close to the innermost stable circular orbit, but the inner disk may evaporate when the mass accretion rate is reduced. Blackbody-like continuum emission and dynamically-broadened iron emission lines provide independent means of probing the radial extent of the inner disk. Here, we present an X-ray study of eight black {{holes in the}} low-hard state. A thermal disk continuum with a colour temperature consistent with L ∝ T^ 4 is clearly detected in all eight sources, down to ≈ 5 × 10 ^- 4 L_Edd. In six sources, disk models exclude a truncation radius larger than 10 rg. Iron-ka fluorescence line emission is observed in half of the sample, down to luminosities of ≈ 1. 5 × 10 ^- 3 L_Edd. Detailed fits to the line profiles exclude a truncated disk in each case. If strong evidence of truncation is defined as (1) a non-detection of a broad iron line, and (2) an inner disk temperature much cooler than expected from the L∝ T^ 4 relation, none of the spectra in this <b>sample</b> <b>offer</b> strong evidence of disk truncation. This suggests that the inner disk may evaporate at or below ≈ 1. 5 × 10 ^- 3 L_Edd. Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 20 pages, 18 figure...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} new {{insights}} into the importance of decomposing aggregate time series data using the Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform. In particular, the analysis throughout this thesis involves decomposing aggregate financial time series data at hand into approximation (low-frequency) and detail (high-frequency) components. Following this, information and hidden relations can be extracted for different investment horizons, as matched with the detail components. The first study examines the ability of different GARCH models to forecast stock return volatility in eight international stock markets. The results demonstrate that de-noising the returns improves the accuracy of volatility forecasts regardless of the statistical test employed. After de-noising, the asymmetric GARCH approach tends to be preferred, although that result is not universal. Furthermore, wavelet de-noising is found to be more important at the key 99 % Value-at-Risk level compared to the 95 % level. The second study examines the impact of fourteen macroeconomic news announcements on the stock and bond return dynamic correlation in the U. S. from the day of the announcement up to sixteen days afterwards. Results conducted over the full <b>sample</b> <b>offer</b> very little evidence that macroeconomic news announcements affect the stock-bond return dynamic correlation. However, after controlling for the financial crisis of 2007 - 2008 several announcements become significant both on the announcement day and afterwards. Furthermore, the study observes that news released early in the day, i. e. before 12 pm, and {{in the first half of}} the month, exhibit a slower effect on the dynamic correlation than those released later in the month or later in the day. While several announcements exhibit significance in the 2008 crisis period, only CPI and Housing Starts show significant and consistent effects on the correlation outside the 2001, 2008 and 2011 crises periods. The final study investigates whether recent returns and the time-scaled return can predict the subsequent trading in ten stock markets. The study finds little evidence that recent returns do predict the subsequent trading, though this predictability is observed more over the long-run horizon. The study also finds a statistical relation between trading and return over the long-time investment horizons of [8 - 16] and [16 - 32] day periods. Yet, this relation is mostly a negative one, only being positive for developing countries. It also tends to be economically stronger during bull-periods...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} {{followed by a}} steady maintenance of elevated levels of obesity in the United States is alarming and necessitates action. While behavioral treatment of obesity is showing moderate success of initial weight loss, maintenance of lost weight is more common than traditional calorie restrictive dieting approaches. This is particularly relevant {{during the holiday season}} where people can gain 1 - 5 % of their total body weight during this short period of time. Therefore, it is critical that we explore additional ways to help individuals maintain their lost weight, particularly during a challenging time of year.    The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the impact of using Direct Behavior Ratings via the Internet to help individuals successfully maintain their weight immediately following completion of a treatment program over a 6 -week period during the holidays. The pilot study operated within a behavioral framework to deliver evidenced based formative assessment through the use DBR as a progress monitoring and self-monitoring tool delivered via the Internet through bi-weekly emails. Additionally, tailored quantitative and qualitative feedback was integrated through reports issued bi-weekly that contained graphical representations of the data in addition to therapeutic statements regarding individual progress.    The pilot study consisted of a two-phase design wherein Phase I (non-experimental) was the initial treatment and Phase II (experimental) was the follow-up treatment. Phase I treatment consisted of the ASPIRE Small Changes Program utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy with the Traffic Light Diet and pedometers for physical activity. Initially, 16 participants were recruited from the ASPIRE Small Changes Program at East Carolina University's Psychological Assessment and Specialty Services (PASS) clinic; 14 participants were included in the final analysis.    At the conclusion of treatment, group level weight maintenance was achieved. In addition, strong relationships were noted between the variables of red foods and green foods and compliance indicating participants who reported higher levels of success in meeting red and green food goals were also more likely to complete and return ratings as hypothesized. A strong relationship between weight change in Phase I and ratings of success in meeting red, green, and step count goals was evident.    The weight maintenance achieved in our pilot sample provides promise for future utilization of DBR as a follow-up treatment delivered via the Internet. Based on our preliminary data there is reason to believe success in Phase I of treatment can encourage long term maintenance of dietary balance with minimal intervention. The findings of our pilot <b>sample</b> <b>offer</b> additional insight into the treatment of obesity and overweight with particular relevance to achieving follow-up weight maintenance. Subsequent research should continue to explore the utility of DBR for self-monitoring of healthy weight behaviors and the modality of the Internet for treatment delivery.   M. A...|$|E
