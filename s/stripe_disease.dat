40|$|Abstract Background Herbaspirillum rubrisubalbicans {{was first}} {{identified}} as a bacterial plant pathogen, causing the mottled <b>stripe</b> <b>disease</b> in sugarcane. H. rubrisubalbicans can also associate with various plants of economic interest in a non pathogenic manner. Results A 21 [*]kb DNA region of the H. rubrisubalbicans genome contains a cluster of 26 hrp/hrc genes encoding for the type three secretion system (T 3 SS) proteins. To investigate the contribution of T 3 SS to the plant-bacterial interaction process we generated mutant strains of H. rubrisubalbicans M 1 carrying a Tn 5 insertion in both the hrcN and hrpE genes. H. rubrisulbalbicans hrpE and hrcN mutant strains of the T 3 SS system failed to cause the mottled <b>stripe</b> <b>disease</b> in the sugarcane susceptible variety B- 4362. These mutant strains also did not produce lesions on Vigna unguiculata leaves. Oryza sativa and Zea mays colonization experiments showed that mutations in hrpE and hrcN genes reduced the capacity of H. rubrisulbalbicans to colonize these plants, suggesting that hrpE and hrcN genes {{are involved in the}} endophytic colonization. Conclusions Our results indicate that the T 3 SS of H. rubrisubalbicans is necessary {{for the development of the}} mottled <b>stripe</b> <b>disease</b> and endophytic colonization of rice. </p...|$|E

40|$|Population genetic {{structures}} illustrate evolutionary {{trajectories of}} organisms adapting to differential environmental conditions. Verticillium stem <b>striping</b> <b>disease</b> on oilseed rape was mainly observed in continental Europe, but has recently {{emerged in the}} United Kingdom. The disease {{is caused by the}} hybrid fungal species Verticillium longisporum that originates from at least three separate hybridization events, yet hybrids between Verticillium progenitor species A 1 and D 1 are mainly responsible for Verticillium stem striping. We reveal a hitherto un-described dichotomy within V. longisporum lineage A 1 /D 1 that correlates with the geographic distribution of the isolates with an 'A 1 /D 1 West' and an 'A 1 /D 1 East' cluster. Genome comparison between representatives of the A 1 /D 1 West and East clusters excluded population distinctiveness through separate hybridization events. Remarkably, the A 1 /D 1 West population that is genetically more diverse than the entire A 1 /D 1 East cluster caused the sudden emergence of Verticillium stem striping in the UK, whereas in continental Europe Verticillium stem striping is predominantly caused by the more genetically uniform A 1 /D 1 East population. The observed genetic diversity of the A 1 /D 1 West population argues against a recent introduction of the pathogen into the UK, but rather suggests that the pathogen previously established in the UK and remained latent or unnoticed as oilseed rape pathogen until recently. </p...|$|R
40|$|Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg) is an {{important}} economic crop in Thailand. Leaf fall and black <b>stripe</b> <b>diseases</b> caused by the aggressive oomycete pathogen Phytophthora palmivora, cause deleterious damage on rubber tree growth leading to decrease of latex production. To gain insights into the molecular function of H. brasiliensis subtilisin-like serine proteases, the HbSPA, HbSPB, and HbSPC genes were transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana via agroinfiltration. A functional protease encoded by HbSPA was successfully expressed in the apoplast of N. benthamiana leaves. Transient expression of HbSPA in N. benthamiana leaves enhanced resistance to P. palmivora, suggesting that HbSPA plays {{an important}} role in plant defense. P. palmivora Kazal-like extracellular protease inhibitor 10 (PpEPI 10), an apoplastic effector, has been implicated in pathogenicity through the suppression of H. brasiliensis protease. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the PpEPI 10 gene was significantly up-regulated during colonization of rubber tree by P. palmivora. Concurrently, the HbSPA gene was highly expressed during infection. To investigate a possible interaction between HbSPA and PpEPI 10, the recombinant PpEPI 10 protein (rPpEPI 10) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using affinity chromatography. In-gel zymogram and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays demonstrated that rPpEPI 10 specifically inhibited and interacted with HbSPA. The targeting of HbSPA by PpEPI 10 revealed a defense-counterdefense mechanism, which is mediated by plant protease and pathogen protease inhibitor, in H. brasiliensis-P. palmivora interactions...|$|R

40|$|This review {{examines}} {{recent studies}} of the migration of three rice planthoppers, Laodelphax striatellus, Sogatella furcifera, and Nilaparvata lugens, in East Asia. Laodelphax striatellus has recently broken out in Jiangsu province, eastern China. The population density in the province started to increase in the early 2000 s and peaked in 2004. In 2005, Rice stripe virus (RSV) viruliferous rate of L. striatellus peaked at 31. 3 %. Since then, rice <b>stripe</b> <b>disease</b> spread severely across the whole province. Due to the migration of the RSV vectors, the rice <b>stripe</b> <b>disease</b> spread to neighboring countries Japan and Korea. An overseas migration of L. striatellus that occurred in 2008 was analyzed, when a slow-moving cold vortex, a type of low pressure system, reached western Japan from Jiangsu, carrying the insects into Japan. Subsequently the rice stripe diseases struck these areas in Japan severely. In Korea, similar situations occurred in 2009, 2011, and 2012. Their migration sources were also estimated to be in Jiangsu by backward trajectory analysis. Rice black-streaked dwarf virus, whose vector is L. striatellus, has recently re-emerged in eastern China, and the evidence for overseas migrations of the virus, just like the RSV’s migrations, has been given. A method of predicting the overseas migration of L. striatellus has been developed by Japanese, Chinese, and Korean institutes. An evaluation of the prediction showed that this method properly predicted migration events that occurred in East Asia from 2008 to 2011. Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) was first found in Guangdong province. Its vector is S. furcifera.

30|$|Among {{its many}} effects, global warming {{influences}} the distribution, incidence {{and severity of}} plant disease worldwide (Juroszek and von Tiedemann 2015). In rice (Oryza sativa L.), many pests and the pathogens they transmit are influenced by global warming. For example, a geographical shift in the prevalence of rice <b>stripe</b> virus <b>disease,</b> transmitted by the small brown planthopper, is predicted to result from global warming in Japan (Yamamura and Yokozawa 2002).

Among these are pathogens that cause agriculturally important diseases such as sheath blight, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, brown spot (BS), caused by Bipolaris oryzae, and bacterial seedling rot (BSR) and bacterial grain rot (BGR), both caused by Burkholderia glumae, because the optimal temperature ranges for growth of these pathogens are relatively high (around 30  °C). Sheath blight is considered as one of the three major diseases of rice (along with blast and bacterial blight) (Zou et al. 2000; Hu et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2010), and many studies have been done to enhance resistance to sheath blight.

Moreover, since inoculation of barley rootlets by the fungushad been shown to induce the accumulation of several PR (pathogen-related) mRNA families, seven barley PR genes have been mapped asRFLPs, and one assigned to a chromosome arm via ditelosomic analysisto verify possible map associations with resistance QTLs. This workdiscusses the genetic relationships between the known leaf stripe resistance loci, resistance loci towards other seed!borne pathogens anddefence gene loci...|$|E
40|$|Disease {{has been}} implied as an {{important}} selective force acting in plant populations. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the effects of stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis) on the population dynamics of wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivar mixtures. Five wheat cultivars were grown in pure stands and all possible mixtures at three and two locations in 1987 and 1988, respectively. In 1989, four replacement series and their component pure stands were grown in two locations. All treatments were exposed to or protected from two <b>stripe</b> rust races. <b>Disease</b> severity and yield were determined on a per-cultivar basis for mixtures and also for pure stands. In all but one mixture, disease severity relative to the pure stands was reduced between 6 and 97 %. Disease severity changes could be separated into two effects...|$|R
40|$|Wheat stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{diseases}} of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. To gain a better understanding of the protective mechanism against stripe rust at the adult plant stage, this study investigated the differences in photosystem II (PSII) and antioxidant enzymatic systems between susceptible and resistant wheat in response to <b>stripe</b> rust <b>disease</b> caused by Puccinia striiformis. We found that chlorophyll fluorescence and the activities of the antioxidant enzymes were higher in resistant wheat than in susceptible wheat after stripe rust infection. Compared with the susceptible wheat, the resistant wheat accumulated a higher content of D 1 protein and a lower level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after infection. Further, this is the first study to demonstrate that D 1 and LHCII phosphorylation are involved in the resistance to stripe rust in wheat. In addition, we found that CP 29 was phosphorylated under stripe rust infection; CP 29 is also phosphorylated in monocots under other environmental stresses. Furthermore, the thylakoid structure showed more extensive damage in the susceptible wheat compared with that observed in the resistant wheat. Therefore, these findings provide evidence that thylakoid protein phosphorylation and antioxidant enzyme systems play an important role in plant responses and defense mechanisms in wheat cultivars subject to this type of biotic stress...|$|R
40|$|We {{surveyed}} {{the occurrence of}} Rice <b>stripe</b> virus (RSV) <b>disease</b> in 672 fields from 29 rice representative area inJuly 2012 as nationwide survey for RSV occurrence since 2008. We confirmed occurrence of virus disease in 18 areas, in west coast region including Secheon, Taean, Buwan and Cheorwon. RSV incidence rates of plantin Sacheon and Buan were less than 0. 01 % and 0. 15 %, respectively, showing similar rate with the nationwidesurvey carried out in 2008, whereas incidence rate of field declined from 19. 9 % in 2008 to 4. 9 % in 2012. Earlier, RSV occurred largely across the southern region of Korea. In 2001, RSV disease was found inGangwha and Gyeonggi-do, the northern region of Korea. In 2007, RSV appeared in west coast; Buan inJeollabuk-do and Seocheon in Choongnam-do. After migration of the vector, small brown plant hopper, fromChina in 2009, RSV is becoming a pandemic...|$|R
