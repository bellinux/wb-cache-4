50|$|Selective ion track etching {{is closely}} related to the <b>selective</b> <b>etching</b> of grain {{boundaries}} and crystal dislocations. The etch process must be sufficiently slow to discriminate between the irradiated and the pristine material. The resulting shape depends on the type of material, the concentration of the etchant, and the temperature of the etch bath. In crystals and glasses, <b>selective</b> <b>etching</b> is due to the reduced density of the ion track. In polymers, <b>selective</b> <b>etching</b> is due to polymer fragmentation in the ion track core. The core zone is surrounded by a track halo in which cross-linking can impede track etching. After removal of the cross-linked track halo, the track radius grows linear in time. The result of <b>selective</b> <b>etching</b> is a trough, pore, or channel.|$|E

30|$|Since a high hillock but {{rough surface}} can be {{produced}} by <b>selective</b> <b>etching</b> at a high temperature or a long time, the temperature below 50  °C is recommended for friction-induced <b>selective</b> <b>etching,</b> and a short etching time can facilitate forming a smooth surface.|$|E
30|$|The {{temperature}} has {{an obvious}} {{effect on the}} height of the nanostructures and surface roughness produced by friction-induced <b>selective</b> <b>etching.</b> Before the collapse of the hillock, {{the height of the}} hillock increases with temperature for the same etching time.

30|$|To sum up, {{the effect}} of etching {{temperature}} on the height of protrusive hillocks, surface roughness of silicon, surface wetting, mechanical performance, and chemical composition was comparatively investigated. Firstly, the removal of surface oxide enables the <b>selective</b> <b>etching,</b> and the hillock height can be controlled by choosing appropriate etching time and temperature as shown in Fig.  2. Secondly, the cooperative effect of etching time and temperature on the fabrication quality {{should be taken into}} account for real fabrication. Although high temperature enables a rapid <b>selective</b> <b>etching</b> rate, resulting in high protrusive hillocks, it also causes a rough surface. Considering the collapse of the hillock by excessive etching (Figs.  1 and 2), the temperature below 50  °C is recommended in the present study for <b>selective</b> <b>etching.</b> Since a longer etching time can also cause a rougher silicon surface (Figs.  4 and 5), the etching time should be selected based on the requirement for hillock height and surface roughness. Finally, the <b>selective</b> <b>etching</b> results in a clean surface without contaminations, and the chemical reaction can be predicted by the Arrhenius equation. It should be highlighted that based on the Arrhenius equation, the <b>selective</b> <b>etching</b> process can be further controlled by adjusting the solution concentration, etching temperature, and time. The present study is expected to provide an insight into the understanding, controlling, and application of friction-induced selective nanofabrication.|$|E

With {{the advantages of}} simple processing, high flexibility, and minor cost, friction-induced nanofabrication provides a convenient method for producing nanostructures on silicon, quartz, glass, and GaAs surfaces more easily than photolithography with etching masks [9 – 15]. Yu et al. [9] proposed the friction-induced method to fabricate convex nanostructure on silicon surface with a diamond tip. Based on this, Guo et al. [10, 11] produced a series of protrusive hillocks with the height of hundreds of nanometers on silicon surface by the friction-induced <b>selective</b> <b>etching.</b> Furthermore, tribochemistry-induced <b>selective</b> <b>etching</b> can also produce defect-free nanostructures on silicon [12, 14].
