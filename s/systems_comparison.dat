50|$|Tlingit is distantly {{related to}} the Athabaskan-Eyak group to form the Na-Dene family, also known as Athabaskan-Eyak-Tlingit (AET). With Jeff Leer's 2010 advances, the reconstructions of Na-Dene (or Athabascan-Eyak-Tlingit) consonants, this latter {{grouping}} is considered by Alaskan linguists to be a well-demonstrated family. Because both Tlingit and Eyak are fairly remote from the Athabaskan languages {{in terms of their}} sound <b>systems,</b> <b>comparison</b> is usually done between them and the reconstructed Proto-Athabaskan language. This resembles both Tlingit and Eyak much more than most of the daughter languages in the Athabaskan family.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of a separate Gonâve Microplate was first suggested by the analysis of sidescan sonar results from the Cayman Trough. This study found evidence for continuous transform type faults along the southern flank of the trough, to {{both sides of the}} spreading centre. GPS data supports the existence of the microplate by showing that the relative motion between the North American and Caribbean plates is split almost equally between the two bounding transform fault <b>systems.</b> <b>Comparison</b> of these rates with observations of magnetic stripes within the Cayman Trough suggests that displacement is increasingly being transferred from the northern fault system to the southern one. This observation is consistent with the eventual accretion of the Gonâve Microplate to the North American Plate.|$|E
