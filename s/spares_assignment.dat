40|$|In {{this thesis}} we propose and study a {{self-repairing}} tree-based pre-planned link protection scheme for backbone mesh survivable networks. We introduce {{the concept of}} hierarchical protection trees for unicast traffic protection on network links. The design of the protection tree is formulated and heuristic algorithms are provided for two separate scenarios: (1) the unrestricted <b>spare</b> capacity <b>assignment</b> where the minimization of spare capacity is the objective, and (2) the pre-designed network scenario where the objective of design is to maximize the total network restorability. Using various models for computation, we apply our design techniques to construct the protection tree in each sample network in each scenario, and compute various restoration performance measures of restorability, redundancy, and average backup path length. We conduct extensive studies of the performance trends of the hierarchical protection trees on a database that we built from thousands of randomly generated mesh networks with varying topology parameters such as network size, number of nodes, average nodal degree, network radius, and variation in network load. We have also extended our study to the multiple (double and triple) failure scenarios. We present computational methods to calculate the multiple failure restorability and redundancy requirements for the sample networks from our database. Finally, we provide a comprehensive scheme that covers the signalling, message formats, algorithms and recovery mechanisms for construction of a hierarchical tree in a distributed manner. The advantages and limitations of this new approach are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} traffic demands in the networks, {{it has become}} essential to design networks that are robust to different traffic conditions. The common approach of proceeding by over-provisioning to accommodate traffic change, or events such as link failures, leads to a massive waste of resource and energy. On the other hand, {{it is challenging to}} provide solutions which are robust to traffic change due to unpredictable nature of the traffic. This thesis focuses on providing robust optimization models for power efficient and resilient networks with traffic uncertainty. In {{the first part of the}} thesis an optimization model for power efficient networks with traffic uncertainty is introduced. Most of the studies nowadays pertaining to the field of green communications are based on estimates of real traffic matrix. However predicting the traffic matrix is a difficult task for network operators. These models may not be fully applicable in a context where the traffic often fluctuates. The optimization approach presented in the thesis, which is named the hose model with bound of link traffic (HLT), is extended from the hose model. By using HLT, the knowledge of the exact traffic information is not required. The model is constructed by specifying the total outgoing and incoming amount at each node and the total traffic going through each link. The power efficiency problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, with an objective to reduce the flow through each link and allow the links to be put to sleep mode. To mitigate the complexity of solving the MILP formulation, an heuristic based on a linear programming formulation of HLT is presented. Simulation results show that the scheme, while being robust to traffic uncertainty, achieves power efficiency comparable to the models where the knowledge of the traffic information is required. In the second part of the thesis, the optimization model based on HLT for resilient networks, is presented. The <b>spare</b> capacity <b>assignment</b> problem is investigated. Preplanned link restoration preallocates protection resources during the configuration phase of the networks. The technique involves over-provisioning of the network resources to provide enough spare capacity in order to route the traffic on backup paths in case of failure in the primary network. As a consequence, this induces extra-costs for the operators. Minimizing the toll incurred by the protection techniques is desirable for them. Most of the link protection techniques nowadays are either designed to provide along the backup path(s) the same capacity as the primary failed link, or by taking into account exact values of the traffic demands. While it is possible to reconsider the capacity requirement, it is worth recalling the difficulty for the operators to know the exact traffic matrix (set of traffic demands) in the network. We provide a mathematical formulation to minimize the capacity requirements of the backup networks, which considers the traffic uncertainty. The design of a backup network, which exclusively reroutes the traffic in case of a link failure in an existing primary network, is considered. We formulate a linear programming problem for the design and capacity provisioning of backup networks with traffic uncertainty under HLT. From the simulation results, a reduction ranging from 29. 75 % to 70 % is achieved in the spare capacity required for the backup networks. 電気通信大学 201...|$|R
40|$|Institute for Computing Systems ArchitectureRAID systems (Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks) have {{dominated}} backend storage systems {{for more than}} two decades and have grown continuously in size and complexity. Currently they face unprecedented challenges from data intensive applications such as image processing, transaction processing and data warehousing. As the size of RAID systems increases, designers are faced with both performance and reliability challenges. These challenges include limited back-end network bandwidth, physical interconnect failures, correlated disk failures and long disk reconstruction time. This thesis studies the scalability of RAID systems in terms of both performance and reliability through simulation, using a discrete event driven simulator for RAID systems (SIMRAID) developed as part of this project. SIMRAID incorporates two benchmark workload generators, based on the SPC- 1 and Iometer benchmark specifications. Each component of SIMRAID is highly parameterised, enabling it to explore a large design space. To improve the simulation speed, SIMRAID develops a set of abstraction techniques to extract the behaviour of the interconnection protocol without losing accuracy. Finally, to meet the technology trend toward heterogeneous storage architectures, SIMRAID develops a framework that allows easy modelling of different types of device and interconnection technique. Simulation experiments were first carried out on performance aspects of scalability. They were designed to answer two questions: (1) given a number of disks, which factors affect back-end network bandwidth requirements; (2) given an interconnection network, how many disks can be connected to the system. The results show that the bandwidth requirement per disk is primarily determined by workload features and stripe unit size (a smaller stripe unit size has better scalability than a larger one), with cache size and RAID algorithm having very little effect on this value. The maximum number of disks is limited, as would be expected, by the back-end network bandwidth. Studies of reliability have led to three proposals to improve the reliability and scalability of RAID systems. Firstly, a novel data layout called PCDSDF is proposed. PCDSDF combines the advantages of orthogonal data layouts and parity declustering data layouts, so that it can not only survivemultiple disk failures caused by physical interconnect failures or correlated disk failures, but also has a good degraded and rebuild performance. The generating process of PCDSDF is deterministic and time-efficient. The number of stripes per rotation (namely the number of stripes to achieve rebuild workload balance) is small. Analysis shows that the PCDSDF data layout can significantly improve the system reliability. Simulations performed on SIMRAID confirm the good performance of PCDSDF, which is comparable to other parity declustering data layouts, such as RELPR. Secondly, a system architecture and rebuilding mechanism have been designed, aimed at fast disk reconstruction. This architecture is based on parity declustering data layouts and a disk-oriented reconstruction algorithm. It uses stripe groups instead of stripes as the basic distribution unit so that it can make use of the sequential nature of the rebuilding workload. The design space of system factors such as parity declustering ratio, chunk size, private buffer size of surviving disks and free buffer size are explored to provide guidelines for storage system design. Thirdly, an efficient distributed hot <b>spare</b> allocation and <b>assignment</b> algorithm for general parity declustering data layouts has been developed. This algorithm avoids conflict problems in the process of assigning distributed spare space for the units on the failed disk. Simulation results show that it effectively solves the write bottleneck problem and, at the same time, there is only a small increase in the average response time to user requests...|$|R
