5|$|Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is {{credited}} with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, and Leonard Smith. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims he <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> few of the scenes with Eskimo women when coverage {{was found to be}} lacking. Numerous days of shooting were lost in the summer when strong sunlight made it impossible to film. To reduce glare from the snow, most of the sets were sprayed with pink paint from the air.|$|E
5|$|Gens' {{wife and}} {{daughter}} were living near the ghetto {{on the day he}} was <b>shot.</b> <b>A</b> Jewish policeman informed them that Gens had been shot and that the Gestapo was looking for them. They fled and managed to stay in hiding until Soviet troops arrived. In 1945, they obtained papers for repatriation to Poland. From there they moved to West Germany as Jewish aliyah. They emigrated to Australia in 1948 and to the United States in 1953.|$|E
5000|$|Language {{is often}} implicated in humor. For example, the {{structural}} ambiguity of sentences {{is a key}} source for jokes. Take Groucho Marx's line from Animal Crackers: [...] "One morning I <b>shot</b> <b>an</b> elephant in my pyjamas; how he got into my pyjamas I'll never know." [...] The joke is funny because the main sentence could theoretically mean either that (1) the speaker, while wearing pajamas, <b>shot</b> <b>an</b> elephant or (2) the speaker <b>shot</b> <b>an</b> elephant that was inside his pyjamas.|$|R

50|$|Thus a rifleman was {{expected}} to be able to fire two aimed <b>shots</b> <b>a</b> minute, compared to the four <b>shots</b> <b>a</b> minute for the Brown Bess musket {{in the hands of a}} trained infantryman. However, the average time to reload a rifle is dependent on the level of training and experience of the user; twenty seconds (or three <b>shots</b> <b>a</b> minute) is possible for a highly proficient rifleman. Using a hand-measured powder charge for accurate long range shots could increase the load time to as much as a minute.|$|R
5|$|He next {{went down}} to the first-floor cafeteria, in which about a hundred people were gathered. The crowd {{scattered}} after he <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> woman standing near the kitchens and wounded another student. Entering an unlocked storage area {{at the end of the}} cafeteria, Lépine shot and killed two more women hiding there. He told a male and female student to come out from under a table; they complied and were not shot.|$|E
5|$|Her {{first scene}} was for The Oral Adventures of Craven Moorehead 8 with her agent Slim Shady (Dez) {{and his best}} friend, Moorehead. It was {{intended}} to only be an oral scene, but {{in the heat of}} the moment she had intercourse with both. The next day she <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> scene with Miles Long in Joey Silvera's Service Animals 4. A few months later, she realized that she did not need an agent and started to represent herself.|$|E
5|$|In {{retirement}} Ford also devoted {{much time}} to his love of golf, often playing both privately and in public events with comedian Bob Hope, a longtime friend. In 1977, he <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> hole in one during a Pro-am held {{in conjunction with the}} Danny Thomas Memphis Classic at Colonial Country Club in Memphis, Tennessee. He hosted the Jerry Ford Invitational in Vail, Colorado from 1977 to 1996.|$|E

5|$|On 6 January, the {{battalion}} while {{still attached to}} the 12th Armored Division, was assigned to participate in Task Force Wahl led by the 79th Infantry Division, which was defending against the January, 1945, German counteroffensive in the Alsace-Lorraine region. Disciplinary problems persisted; the company ordered to lead the move was unable to deploy as most of its men were absent, and the remainder mostly drunk. By the time {{the battalion}} managed to move, one of its officers had <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> man—and been shot himself—while trying to restore order among his company, and in a separate incident a sergeant had been assaulted {{by one of his}} own men and, defending himself, accidentally <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> bystander.|$|E

5|$|Van Peebles had {{received}} a permit to set a car on fire, but had done so on a Friday; as a result, {{there was no time}} to have it filed before shooting the scene. When the scene was <b>shot,</b> <b>a</b> fire truck showed up. This ended up in the final cut of the film.|$|E
5|$|A. Newton {{requested}} further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 {{he finally}} published {{a plate of}} the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and A. Newton noted that it confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out be much more colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year before, but was not carrying a gun at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> male specimen. It {{may have been the}} same specimen Slater had observed. It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the paratype of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.|$|E
5|$|After the Lancastrians {{had ceased}} loosing their arrows, Fauconberg ordered his archers {{to step forward}} again to shoot. When they had {{exhausted}} their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked arrows off {{the ground in front}} of them—arrows loosed by their foes—and continued loosing. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position to engage the Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> few more volleys before retreating behind their ranks of men-at-arms, leaving thousands of arrows in the ground to hinder the Lancastrian attack.|$|E

50|$|Bell was {{the first}} in his {{squadron}} (47) to score an air victory when he <b>shot</b> down <b>a</b> German two-seater aircraft over Salonika on 23 December 1916.

5|$|At 0:35, {{the camera}} {{cuts to the}} {{aftermath}} of The <b>Shot.</b> <b>A</b> young man jumps {{in the air and}} pumps his fist as another young man in an opposing jersey sinks to the floor. The moment is from the 1989 NBA Playoffs, when Jordan hit a game-winning jump shot over Cleveland Cavaliers guard Craig Ehlo. At 0:38 is Jordan's last shot with the Chicago Bulls, after a crossover dribble past Utah Jazz guard Bryon Russell at the end of Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. These scenes are musically punctuated with a bass drum roll and a cymbal crash. Finally, at 0:44 a young man shrugs after hitting a shot, as Jordan shrugged after scoring six three-point field goals {{in the first half of}} Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak on {{the third}} day, the Phocians {{guarding}} the path above Thermopylae {{became aware of the}} outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves. Herodotus says they jumped up and were greatly amazed. Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and his forces. He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes that they were not. The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them). However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> volley of arrows at them, before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main Greek force.|$|E
5|$|Bartley and ÓBriain {{conceived}} {{of the film}} after Bartley returned from documenting {{the aftermath of the}} 1999 Vargas mudslides for an Irish charity. Following a visit to Venezuela to determine the feasibility of a film project, the pair formed a production company and applied to Ireland's film board, Bord Scannán na hÉireann (BSÉ), for a development grant. At BSÉ's request, the filmmakers partnered with a more experienced producer and <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> short pilot to show to potential investors. Funding for the €200,000 production was provided by BSÉ and several European broadcasters. Bartley and ÓBriain shot more than 200hours of material; editing focused on identifying footage that would make the film entertaining and drive the plot. It was at this stage that the film's coverage narrowed to concentrate more on the coup attempt.|$|E

He moved to Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire at age ten and {{attended}} Hinchingbrooke school and played for the Godmanchester Rovers youth system. As a youngster, Bent was a supporter of Arsenal and used to have a season ticket at Highbury. He was handed a formal caution by police in June 2004 after he was alleged to have <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> 12-year-old with a pellet gun. Bent refrains from drinking alcohol and is a Christian.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{then shot}} the {{sequence}} where the Little Tramp first meets the millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide. During filming, Henry Clive suddenly {{decided that he}} did not want to jump into the tank of cold water in the scene, causing Chaplin to storm off the set and fire Clive. He was quickly replaced by Harry Myers, who Chaplin had known while under contract at Keystone Studios. Chaplin finished shooting the sequence on July 29, 1929 with exteriors at Pasadena Bridge. Chaplin then <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> sequence that was eventually cut from the film involving the Little Tramp attempting to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a wall. The scene included a young Charles Lederer; Chaplin later praised the scene, but insisted that it needed to be cut. He then continued filming the scenes with the millionaire until September 29, 1929.|$|E
5|$|Director David Yates {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he had originally <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> three-hour film of Order of the Phoenix. However, some material had to be cut out in the final edit, as the movie was 45 minutes too long. Therefore, several locations which were used for various scenes do not appear in the final cut of the film. In Virginia Water, scenes were shot where Professor McGonagall recovers from Stunning Spells, and Burnham Beeches was used for filming the scene where Hagrid introduces his fifth-year Care of Magical Creatures class to Thestrals. Harry skips stones in front of the Glenfinnan Monument in Glenfinnan in another cut scene.|$|E
