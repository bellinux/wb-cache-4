40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine the aerodynamic properties of rectangular and tapered NACA 23012 wings with plain ailerons and a full-span <b>split</b> <b>flap,</b> the flap retracting ahead of the ailerons. Measurements were made of lift and drag and of pitching, rolling, yawing, and hinge moments for all conditions of full-span flaps neutral and deflected at different chord locations. The results of the tests showed that a 0. 20 c(sub w) full span <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> located at approximately the 0. 75 c(sub w) point gave higher lift coefficients than had previously been obtained with a conventional 0. 20 c(sub w) partial-span <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> of a length to permit satisfactory control with plain ailerons. Still higher lifts were obtained if the full-span flap, when deflected, was {{moved back to the}} aileron axis. Moving the flap back to the aileron, in general, improved the aileron characteristics over those with the flap retracted. The most promising arrangement of full-span <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> and plain aileron combination tested, both for high lift and lateral control, was the rectangular wing with 0. 20 c(sub w) deflected 60 degrees at the 0. 90 c(sub w) location with 0. 10 c(sub w) semispan ailerons...|$|R

The high performance of the design was demonstrated during flight testing after the first flight on 29 November 1954 at Riem, as well as by placing second in the German National Gliding Championships in 1959.

The aim was to provide comfortable accommodation for pilot, passenger and luggage in an enclosed 'side-by-side' cockpit. It was a low-wing monoplane, with fixed main undercarriage in aerodynamic fairings plus a fixed tailwheel. Construction was mainly of wood, with spruce frames and three-ply birch covering, and the wings had vacuum-operated <b>split</b> <b>flaps.</b> It was initially powered by a 130hp (97kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major I piston engine.

A single M.11C was powered by a 145hp (108kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major II engine and variable-pitch propeller.|$|E
25|$|Fuselage {{structure}} was typical for the period, being welded chrome-moly tubing with light wood strips to fair the shape in {{and covered with}} fabric. Wings were built around two solid spruce spars with the airfoil formed from trussed ribs made from plywood and spruce. The leading edge was covered in aluminum sheeting and the whole assembly covered in fabric. Ailerons were interconnected with a strut mounted to the trailing edge and on some versions were sheeted with ribbed aluminum. Most models were not fitted with flaps – the VKS-7F, built for the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) being the exception. It was fitted with <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> only on the undersides of the upper wings and at mid chord, inboard and {{just ahead of the}} ailerons. Wing bracing was with a canted N strut joining upper and lower wings, assisted by a single strut bracing the lower wing to the upper fuselage longeron, there being no bracing wires. Elevators and rudder were built up from welded steel tubing braced with wire cables, and both could be trimmed, the elevators in flight and the rudder with a ground adjustable tab. Normally the main undercarriage was made up of a pair of vees, sprung with oleo/spring struts and provided with brakes as standard equipment, and a free-castoring tailwheel sprung with triangulated shock cords. was fitted to most aircraft, although a small number for Brazil were fitted with a tail skid. Floats were also offered as an option, starting with the UIC which had Edo P-3300 floats. Later types (including the UKC, YKC and CJC) were offered with Edo 38-3430 floats.|$|E

The monocoque fuselage had four [...] ShKAS machine {{guns in the}} nose, each with 1,000 rounds. The pilot and the gunner/radio-operator were seated back-to-back, separated by an armor plate, under sliding canopies. The gunner had a dorsal ShKAS on a TSS-1 mount with 750 rounds {{that could be used}} once his canopy was slid forward. He also had a ventral ShKAS mounted below the armored floor that he could access by raising a hatch in the floor and kneeling down to fire the machine guns.

The single wheel landing gear retracted into the rear part of the nacelles, as did the tailwheel into the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The wing {{radiators}} were shallower and set {{farther back}} on the wing. A new cooling system was introduced; this system was automatically regulated by a thermostat with interconnected variable position inlet and outlet flaps that would balance the lowest drag possible with the most efficient cooling.

For the two arrangements of the slotted flap, the flap positions for maximum section lift are given. Comparable data on the NACA 23012 airfoil equipped with similar flaps are also given. On the basis of maximum section lift coefficient, the slotted flap with an easy slot entry was slightly better than either the <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> or the slotted flap with a sharp slot entry. With both types of flap the decrease in the angle of attack, for maximum section lift coefficient, with flap deflection is large for the NACA 27 - 212 airfoil as compared with the NACA 23012 airfoil. Also with both flaps, the maximum section lift coefficient obtained with flaps is much lower for the NACA 27 - 212 airfoil than for the NACA 23012 airfoil...|$|R
40|$|The steady {{aerodynamic}} effect of miniature trailing-edge devices on a supercritical airfoil {{was investigated in}} transonic flow both experimentally and numerically. The investigations were performed for the Gurney <b>flap,</b> the <b>split</b> <b>flap,</b> and the divergent trailing edge, and they showed a strong influence on the supersonic flow regime, influencing the lift and drag characteristics. At constant lift, a redistribution of the lift generation from the front to the rear part of the airfoil takes place. Total-drag reductions {{can be achieved by}} the reduction of wave drag. The influences of the different types of miniature trailing-edge devices are shown. The investigation of the influence of geometry parameters showed that the variation of the height of the Gurney flap and of the deflection angle of the <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> have similar effects. Perforation of the miniature trailing-edge devices showed only a small influence. The investigation of the influence of the freestream parameters indicated that increases in Mach number and Reynolds number increase the miniature trailing-edge device effect.

The monocoque fuselage was similarly built of 'shpon', molded birch plywood, and also had an integral fin, but it was considerably longer than that of the I-180. The two-spar, all-metal wing was smaller and thinner than the I-180's wing, nearly as thin as that of the Supermarine Spitfire's wing at 13% at the root and tapered to 8% at the wing tip. The wing had a NACA-230 profile and was skinned in duralumin. Pneumatically powered <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> and leading edge slats were fitted. The outer wing panels had 3° of dihedral. The fabric-covered control surfaces were framed in duralumin. The protected [...] fuel tanks were mounted between the wing center section spars. The I-185 used a conventional undercarriage with a retractable tailwheel. The unproven 1,492kW (2,000hp) 18-cylinder, two-row Tumansky M-90 radial engine was carried on welded steel tubes. It was fitted with a ducted spinner to improve cooling with the air expelled through gills as in the I-180 to provide additional thrust. The synchronized armament was mounted in the fuselage, two [...] ShKAS machine guns and two [...] Berezin UBS machine guns. A [...] bomb could be carried under overload conditions. The first prototype was completed in May 1940, but the only available example of the M-90 did not provide enough power for take-off.

The I-185 (M-81) finally took to the air on January 11, 1941, but it was decided not to waste further development and await a more powerful engine which was fortunate as the M-81 was cancelled in May 1941.|$|E

Deflection of <b>split</b> drag <b>flaps</b> {{on one side}} of the wing will produce asymmetric drag force and, as consequences, yawing moment will be produced.

The best flap angle for taking off varies inversely as power loading and, to a much smaller extent, varies inversely with wing loading.
