2500|$|In non-verb-final {{languages}}, {{apart from}} languages like Thai and Vietnamese with very strong politeness distinctions in their grammars, gapped relative clauses tend, however, to {{be restricted to}} positions {{high up in the}} accessibility hierarchy. With obliques and genitives, non-verb-final languages that do not have politeness restrictions on pronoun use tend to use pronoun retention. English is unusual in that all roles in the embedded clause can be indicated by gapping: e.g. [...] "I saw the man who is my friend", but also (in progressively less accessible positions cross-linguistically, according to the accessibility hierarchy described below) [...] "...who I know", [...] "...who I gave a book to", [...] "...who I spoke with", [...] "...who I run slower than". Usually, languages with gapping disallow it beyond a certain level in the accessibility hierarchy, and switch to a different strategy at this point. [...] Classical Arabic, for example, only allows gapping in the subject and sometimes the direct object; beyond that, a resumptive pronoun must be used. Some languages have no allowed strategies at all past a certain point—e.g. in many Austronesian languages, such as Tagalog, all relative clauses must have the shared noun serving the <b>subject</b> <b>role</b> in the embedded clause. In these languages, relative clauses with shared nouns serving [...] "disallowed" [...] roles can be expressed by passivizing the embedded sentence, thereby moving the noun in the embedded sentence into the subject position. This, for example, would transform [...] "The man who I gave a book to" [...] into [...] "The man who was given a book by me". Generally, languages such as this [...] "conspire" [...] to implement general relativization by allowing passivization from all positions — hence a sentence equivalent to [...] "The man who is run slower than by me" [...] is grammatical. Note also that gapping is often used in conjunction with case-marked relative pronouns (since the relative pronoun indicates the case role in the embedded clause), but this is not necessary (e.g. Chinese and Japanese both using gapping in conjunction with an indeclinable complementizer).|$|E
50|$|The German and the English {{examples}} {{differ in}} that in German the <b>subject</b> <b>role</b> {{can be taken}} by das Mädchen (the girl) or die Frau (the woman) while in the English example only the second noun phrase (the woman) can be the subject. In short, because German singular feminine and neuter articles exhibit the same inflected form for the accusative as for the nominative case, the German example is syntactically ambiguous in that either the girl or the woman may be doing the kissing. In the English example, both word-order rules and the test of substituting a relative pronoun with different nominative and accusative case markings (e.g., whom/who*) reveal that only the woman can be doing the kissing.|$|E

50|$|Sinhala {{actively}} uses case marking {{as well as}} verb morphology {{to distinguish}} between volitional and non-volitional verbs.

Sinhala verbs are classified semantically depending on whether they convey a controlled action or an uncontrolled action meaning. The differences between volitive and involitive verbs are apparent through their morphology and phonology. Depending on the verb classification, different theta roles are assigned. Class II verbs select agent <b>subject</b> theta <b>roles.</b> Class I and Class III verbs convey out-of-control actions (involitive) and select experiencer agent <b>subject</b> theta <b>roles.</b> Examples of the three different verb classes in Sinhala are shown below.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{results of}} two corpus studies of information packaging of discourse referents in German {{dedicated to the}} following questions: • Do sentence-initial position, pronominalization and <b>subject</b> <b>role</b> assignment reflect a single un-derlying dimension of discourse salience or multiple dimensions? • If there are multiple dimensions of salience, {{is it possible to}} associate them with a forward-looking and a backward-looking perspective on discourse, as proposed, e. g., in the context of Centering (Grosz et al., 1995) ? This paper presents empirical findings from TüBa-D/Z, a corpus of German newspaper articles, that provide evidence against a unidimensional model of discourse salience, and support the claim that (at least) two dimensions of salience are to be distinguished and that these dimensions are associated with different temporal orientations on discourse. 1 Salience and Information Packaging In the last 30 years, the notion of “salience ” has been employed in many accounts for the information packaging of discourse referents, especially with respect to the choic...|$|E

Recent discussions of predication with Government and Binding theory stress the configurational properties of the phrases involved, and Napoli argues that {{this has led to}} proposals for more and more elaborate syntactic structures that still fail to give genuinely explanatory accounts. She presents a convincing case for the idea of predicate as a semantic primitive that cannot be defined simply by looking at the lexicon or simply at semantic structure, and offers a theory of predication where the key to the subject-predicate relationship is theta role assignment. Napoli then offers principles for the coindexing of a predicate with its <b>subject</b> <b>role</b> player. The coindexing principles use Chomsky 2 ̆ 7 s 1986 notion of barriers, but this study argues that binding is sensitive to thematic structure rather than to configurational notions such as Government and C-Command.

Although exemplification is from English and Italian, the conclusions apply to all configurational languages...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a range of}} so-called “image macro” Internet memes and describes them as emerging multimodal constructions relying as much on image as on text, and apportioning roles to images much like constructional slots, for instance to fill in a <b>subject</b> <b>role</b> in a subjectless clause, or even to provide the main clause content to a textually given when-clause. In addition to existing or partially altered linguistic constructions, many examples also rely on specific top text/bottom text division of labor, and crucially depend on frame metonymy, with limited formal means quickly cueing richly detailed frames (for instance by using iconic images). The popularity of memes, forming series and cycles of iterations and remixes, and their role in establishing and maintaining discourse communities seems {{to be driven by}} a need to express and reconstrue viewpoints, often starting from ideas, affects or stereotypes assumed to be intersubjectively shared with viewers, whose responses they solicit. This paper argues that a proper description of Internet memes of the type considered requires a Construction Grammar approach, complemented by an understanding of viewpoint dynamics in terms of a Discourse Viewpoint Space regulating the network of spaces and viewpoints. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Summary form only given. Role-based {{access control}} (RBAC) is very useful for {{providing}} {{a high level}} description of access control. It enables {{a better understanding of}} the security problems in an institution because it bridges the gap between their technical aspects and their managerial descriptions. Several models have been devised to describe RBAC. However, the definitions of some of the concepts of RBAC, such as <b>subject,</b> <b>role</b> and permission, were open to many interpretations. Also, the devised models for RBAC, did not detail the analysis of the access operations in RBAC. We formalize each of the basic concepts of RBAC for their definitions to be clear and precise. Based on these definitions, a formal state-based model for flat role based access control (FRBAC) is constructed and described in the specification notation Z. This approach permits the close examination of the states in the system. Consequently, it helps to analyse in depth the access operations of RBAC. The model is also refined by supporting the concepts of active roles and private permissions. In the future, the model can be enhanced by extending it to model the delegation and revocation of roles. Other developments of this model include the support of the separation of duty constraints...|$|E
