25|$|German {{regulations}} mandate some {{means to}} stop a train if a person or large object should fall onto the track. Installing doors between track and platform (like on Paris's Météor Line) {{would have been the}} superior solution, but since 6 stations which were already in full operation (the section Rathenauplatz to Rothenburger Straße) needed to be converted, fitting doors to the platform edges would have led to <b>severe</b> <b>service</b> disruptions and station closures. Another problem would have been that the conventionally run trains would have had to be stopped within an area of a few centimeters by the driver, which would have been difficult. Therefore, platform doors were out of the question. After tests with laser light barriers (from the station ceiling to the platform edge) at Plärrer, a combination of CCTV cameras overlooking the track bed and radio frequency barriers between from under the platform edge to the opposing wall were chosen and installed at all stations served by U3. The RF barriers will detect persons and objects falling onto the track. In such a case the ATC will stop any approaching trains on that track immediately and alert the control centre, from where an operator can visually inspect the trackbed at the platform over CCTV and then take the appropriate action.|$|E

2500|$|The {{formation}} of Burlington Northern in 1970 from {{the merger of}} the Northern Pacific, the Great Northern, Burlington Route, and the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway on March 3 [...] created a stronger competitor on most Milwaukee Road routes. To boost competition, the ICC gave the Milwaukee Road the right to connect with new railroads in the West over Burlington Northern tracks. Traffic on its Pacific Extension increased substantially to upwards of four trains a day each way as it began interchanging cars with the Southern Pacific railroad at Portland, Oregon and Canadian railroads at Sumas, Washington. [...] The railroad's foothold on transcontinental traffic leaving the Port of Seattle increased so exponentially that the Milwaukee Road held a staggering advantage over BN carrying nearly 80% of the originating traffic along with 50% of the total container traffic leaving the Puget Sound (prior to <b>severe</b> <b>service</b> declines after roughly 1974).|$|E
60|$|It was evening. The sun was gilding {{the top of}} the {{flagstaff}} with {{a parting}} kiss, and the inhabitants of Moose Fort, having finished their daily toil, were making preparations for their evening meal. On the end of the wharf that jutted out into the stream was assembled a picturesque group of men, who, from the earnest manner in which they conversed, and the energy of their gesticulations, were evidently discussing a subject of more than ordinary interest. Most of them were clad in corduroy trousers, gartered below the knee with thongs of deer-skin, and coarse, striped cotton shirts, open at the neck, so as to expose their sunburnt breasts. A few wore caps which, whatever might have been their original form, were now so much soiled and battered out of shape by long and <b>severe</b> <b>service</b> that they were nondescript; but most of these hardy backwoodsmen were content with the covering afforded by their thick, bushy locks.|$|E

He was a very beautiful boy, tall and graceful in form and his countenance was striking and expressive. He was very frank and open in his disposition and character, speaking honestly, and without fear, the sentiments of his heart, in any presence and on all occasions. He was extremely kind hearted, and amiable, too, in his disposition, averse to saying or doing any thing which could give pain to those around him. In fact, the openness and cordiality of his address and manners, and the unaffected ingenuousness and sincerity which characterized his disposition, made him a universal favorite. His frankness, his childish simplicity, his vivacity, his personal grace and beauty, and his generous and self-sacrificing spirit, rendered him the object of general admiration throughout the court, and filled Mandane's heart with maternal gladness and pride.|$|R
50|$|Compared to Circuit City, a main {{competitor}} at the time, Computer City's {{operations and}} point-of-sale terminals were severely behind the industry.
