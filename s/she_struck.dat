5|$|Alfonso XIII {{served in}} the Spanish fleet from 1915 to 1937. Spain {{remained}} neutral during World War I, and so Alfonso XIII and her sisters were the only European dreadnoughts to avoid the war.

On {{one of her}} homeward {{journeys}} from China, <b>she</b> <b>struck</b> an uncharted rock at , near the island of Pulo Goondy (modern day Pulau Legundi), located just south of Sumatra. She did not suffer any ill effects {{as a result of}} this incident however, which is mentioned in journals of the time only for its noteworthiness as a navigation hazard to other shipping.|$|E
5|$|Bremen {{served on}} the East American Station for the {{majority}} of her career, including the ten years before the outbreak of World War I. She returned to Germany in 1914 {{before the start of the}} war. At the onset of hostilities, she was attached to the fleet in the Baltic tasked with containing the Russians. In August 1915, she participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga, but did not see significant action during the battle. Four months later, on 17 December, <b>she</b> <b>struck</b> two Russian naval mines and sank, with the loss of 250 of her crew.|$|E
5|$|HMS Gipsy was a G-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the 1930s. She {{spent most of the}} pre-war period as part of the Mediterranean Fleet. The ship was transferred to the British Isles to escort shipping in local waters shortly after the beginning of World War II. Less than a month after her arrival <b>she</b> <b>struck</b> a mine outside Harwich and sank with the loss of 30 of her crew.

5|$|In 1969, Fitzgerald {{received}} a safety award {{for eight years}} of operation without a time-off worker injury. The vessel ran aground in 1969, and she collided with SS Hochelaga in 1970. Later that same year, <b>she</b> <b>struck</b> {{the wall of a}} lock, an accident repeated in 1973 and 1974. During 1974, she lost her original bow anchor in the Detroit River. None of these mishaps, however, were considered serious or unusual. Freshwater ships were built to last more than half a century, and Fitzgerald should still have had a long career ahead of her when she sank.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey dashed up the North Korean coast raiding {{transportation}} facilities from 1 to 6 November. <b>She</b> <b>struck</b> at bridges, road, and rail installations at Wonsan, Hungnam, Tanchon, Iowon, Songjin, and Chongjin, leaving four bridges destroyed, others badly damaged, two marshaling yards badly torn up, and many feet of track destroyed.

5|$|The Amina Bokhary {{controversy}} {{occurred in}} Hong Kong in 2010 involving the assault conviction {{of a wealthy}} woman from a well-connected political family. Amina Mariam Bokhary, 32, received a non-custodial sentence and a one-year driving ban following an incident {{in the aftermath of}} a road traffic accident when <b>she</b> <b>struck</b> several police officers. As she had committed similar offences in 2001 and 2008, her resulting probation was seen by some commentators as too lenient.|$|E
5|$|After a {{few weeks}} {{assigned}} to Western Approaches Command, the 1st DF {{was assigned to the}} Nore Command at Harwich, although some of the ships were transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla, where they were tasked for escort and patrol duty. Gipsy was sunk on 21 November after <b>she</b> <b>struck</b> a mine, as did Grenville on 19 January 1940. Unlike the 1st DF, the Second was transferred to Force K in Freetown in West Africa, to help search for German commerce raiders. Some ships were later transferred to Bermuda and the West Indies for escort work and patrolling. They returned to the UK in January and spent several months refitting.|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, Augsburg {{spent her}} peacetime career {{first as a}} torpedo test ship {{and then as a}} gunnery {{training}} ship. After the outbreak of World War I, she was assigned to the Baltic Sea, where she spent the entire war. On 2 August 1914, she participated in an operation that saw the first shots of the war with Russia fired, and she later took part in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 and Operation Albion in October 1917, as well as numerous smaller engagements throughout the war. <b>She</b> <b>struck</b> a mine, once, in January 1915, though the ship was again operational in a few months. After the end of the war, Augsburg was ceded to Japan as a war prize, and was subsequently broken up for scrap in 1922.|$|E
50|$|<b>She</b> was <b>struck</b> in 1920, {{and sold}} for scrap the next year.|$|R
50|$|Later in the war, {{the ship}} was torpedoed twice in the English Channel. The first time, on 20 March 1918, <b>she</b> was <b>struck</b> near Beachy Head and was towed to Newcastle for {{extensive}} repairs. The second time <b>she</b> was <b>struck</b> near Whitby on 23 July 1918 and was again repaired and, in 1919, was used to repatriate Australian troops.|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s evident <b>she’s</b> <b>struck</b> with me," [...] said Mr. Stiles, slowly; [...] "it’s {{also evident}} {{that if you}} {{tell her the truth}} it might spoil my chances. I don’t say it would, but it might. That being so, I’m {{agreeable}} to going back without seeing her again by the six-forty train to-morrow morning if it’s made worth my while." ...|$|R
5|$|After the war, France and Paris {{supported}} Allied {{forces in}} the Black Sea in 1919 during the Southern Russia Intervention. Mutinies briefly broke out on both ships in April 1919, but collapsed when Vice-Admiral Jean-Françoise-Charles Amet agreed to meet their main demand to take the ships home. 26 crewmen were sentenced to prison terms upon her return, although they were commuted in 1922 {{as part of a}} bargain between Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré and the parties of the Left. On 26 August 1922, <b>she</b> <b>struck</b> an uncharted rock in Quiberon Bay and foundered four hours later. Of her crew of 900, only three were lost. She was not modernized before her loss.|$|E
5|$|Bouvet {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her career alternating between the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons. At the outbreak of World War I, she escorted troop convoys from North Africa to France. She then joined the naval operations off the Dardanelles, where she participated in a major attack on the Turkish fortresses in the straits on 18 March 1915. During the attack, she was hit approximately eight times by shellfire, though did not suffer fatal damage. <b>She</b> <b>struck</b> a mine at around 3:15, and sank within two minutes; only some 50 men were rescued from a complement of 710. Two British battleships were also sunk by mines that day, and the disaster convinced the Allies to abandon the naval campaign {{in favor of an}} amphibious assault on Gallipoli.|$|E
5|$|During the World War II German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Morava was the flagship of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division, and operated on the River Tisza. She fought off attacks by the Luftwaffe, and shot down one enemy aircraft, but {{was forced to}} withdraw to Belgrade. Due to high river levels and low bridges, navigating monitors was difficult, and she was scuttled by her crew on 11 April. Some of her crew tried to escape cross-country towards the southern Adriatic coast, but most surrendered on 14 April. The remainder {{made their way to}} the Bay of Kotor, which was captured by the Italian XVII Corps on 17 April. She was later raised by the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, an Axis puppet state, and continued in service as Bosna until June 1944, when <b>she</b> <b>struck</b> a mine and sank.|$|E
