5|$|Licancabur is {{considered}} a holy mountain by the Atacameno people, related to the Cerro Quimal hill in northern Chile. Archeological sites have been found on its slopes and in the <b>summit</b> <b>crater,</b> which was possibly a prehistoric watchtower.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{activity}} is an ignimbrite erupted 0.65 ± 0.18 mya, called the Tuzgle ignimbrite. On {{the rim of}} the caldera left by this eruption is a lava dome complex named the Old Complex Unit. 0.3 ± 0.1 mya ago effusive activity commenced with the Pre-platform and Platform units that were then followed by a tectonic event that dissected these units. Afterwards, the Post-platform and Young Flow Units were erupted. The youngest unit is latitic and was dated 0.1 ± (0.1-0.3) mya ago. This unit may be Holocene or PleistoceneHolocene in age. It is possible that the continuing activity of the Chorrillos fault zone is compressing the magma chamber and feeder dyke of Tuzgle, thus impeding eruptive activity. The well-preserved <b>summit</b> <b>crater</b> and youthful-looking lava flows have been assigned Holocene ages.|$|E
5|$|This 150-year period next saw the {{eruption}} of less silica-rich lava {{in the form of}} andesitic ash that formed at least eight alternating light- and dark-colored layers. Blocky andesite lava then flowed from St. Helens' <b>summit</b> <b>crater</b> down the volcano's southeast flank. Later, pyroclastic flows raced down over the andesite lava and into the Kalama River valley. It ended with the emplacement of a dacite dome several hundred feet (~200 m) high at the volcano's summit, which filled and overtopped an explosion crater already at the summit. Large parts of the dome's sides broke away and mantled parts of the volcano's cone with talus. Lateral explosions excavated a notch in the southeast crater wall. St. Helens reached its greatest height and achieved its highly symmetrical form by the time the Kalama eruptive cycle ended, about 1647. The volcano remained quiet for the next 150 years.|$|E
5000|$|Trocon is a lava dome {{complex in}} Argentina. It has two <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> and a {{pyroclastic}} cone. It is of estimated Pleistocene-Holocene age. The complex rises from {{an altitude of}} 1968 m and has two <b>summit</b> <b>craters.</b> The volume of the edifice is ill-defined, ranging [...] Lava flows extend eastward from a pyroclastic cone.|$|R
50|$|The top of {{the volcano}} was created by several <b>summit</b> <b>craters.</b> The first {{eruption}} was recorded in 1885. The activity is classified as moderate.|$|R
50|$|Maquinna {{is one of}} the few mud volcanoes {{documented}} in the northeast Pacific. It is 1.5 km across, contains a breached caldera and two small <b>summit</b> <b>craters.</b>|$|R
5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of particles (pyroclasts) with diameters <2 mm (particles >2 mm {{are classified as}} lapilli), and can be as fine as 1 μm. The overall grain size distribution of ash can vary greatly with different magma compositions. Few {{attempts have been made}} to correlate the grain size characteristics of a deposit with those of the event which produced it, though some predictions can be made. Rhyolitic magmas generally produce finer grained material compared to basaltic magmas, due to the higher viscosity and therefore explosivity. The proportions of fine ash are higher for silicic explosive eruptions, probably because vesicle size in the pre-eruptive magma is smaller than those in mafic magmas. There is good evidence that pyroclastic flows produce high proportions of fine ash by communition and it is likely that this process also occurs inside volcanic conduits and would be most efficient when the magma fragmentation surface is well below the <b>summit</b> <b>crater.</b>|$|E
25|$|On August 12, 2014, a new 30m-50m high lava dome {{appeared}} in the <b>summit</b> <b>crater.</b> This event was preceded by inflations of the volcano (measured by precise leveling, tilt data, and GPS), and increases in sulphur dioxide gas emissions.|$|E
25|$|Tungurahua's eruptions are strombolian. They produce {{andesite}} and dacite. All historical eruptions {{originated from}} the <b>summit</b> <b>crater</b> {{and have been}} accompanied by strong explosions, pyroclastic flows and sometimes lava flows. In the last 1,300 years Tungurahua entered every 80 to 100 years into an activity phase of which the major have been the ones of 1773, 1886 and 1916–1918.|$|E
25|$|Through January 2011 to February 2012, the <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> of Etna {{were the}} site of intense activity. Frequent eruptions and ash columns forced the {{authorities}} {{to shut down the}} Catania airport on several occasions.|$|R
50|$|Mount Wurlali (also {{known as}} Mount Damar) is an andesitic {{stratovolcano}} on Damar Island in the Banda Arc system. Fumarolic activities with sulfur deposits are {{found at the}} twin <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> and on the southeast flanks.|$|R
2500|$|Activity {{subsequently}} {{shifted to}} the eastern edifice. Around 5150 ± 1250 BCE, as obtained by surface exposure dating, the Tumbres-Talabre lava flow was erupted from the eastern crater. This flow extends [...] northwest and is [...] thick. The Tumbres-Talabre flow was originally considered to be of late-19th-century age. It probably formed {{when one of the}} craters filled with andesitic lava to the point of overflow. The three eastern <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> formed at the time when the Tumbres-Talabre flow erupted in the remains of the stage I cone. Layers of lava and pyroclastics are discernible in the craters. This edifice is the currently active one, with the deepest of its three <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> being active.|$|R
25|$|Chiliques is a {{stratovolcano}} {{located in}} the Antofagasta Region of Chile, immediately north of Cerro Miscanti. Laguna Lejía lies {{to the north of}} the volcano and has been dormant for at least 10,000years, but is now showing signs of life. A January 6, 2002, nighttime thermal infrared image from ASTER revealed a hot spot in the <b>summit</b> <b>crater,</b> as well as several others along the upper flanks of the volcano’s edifice, indicating new volcanic activity. Examination of an earlier nighttime thermal infrared image from May 24, 2000, showed no such hot spots.|$|E
25|$|Mayon Volcano is the Philippines' {{most active}} volcano. It has steep upper slopes that average 35–40° and is capped {{by a small}} <b>summit</b> <b>crater.</b> The {{historical}} eruptions of this basaltic-andesitic volcano dates back to 1616 and ranges from Strombolian to basaltic Plinian eruptions. Eruptions occur predominately from the central conduit and have also produced lava flows that travel far down the flanks. Pyroclastic flows and mudflows have commonly swept down many of the roughly 40 ravines that radiate from the summit and have often devastated populated lowland areas.|$|E
25|$|At 1:58am on November 11, 2009, a minor ash {{explosion}} {{occurred at}} the <b>summit</b> <b>crater</b> lasting for about three minutes. This was recorded by the seismic network as an explosion-type earthquake with rumbling sounds. Incandescent rock fragments at the upper slope were observed in nearby barangays. Ash column was not observed because of cloud cover. After dawn, field investigation showed ashfall had drifted southwest of the volcano. In the 24-hour period, the seismic network recorded 20 volcanic earthquakes. Alert Status was kept at Level 2 indicating {{the current state of}} unrest could lead to more ash explosion or eventually to hazardous magmatic eruption.|$|E
50|$|Activity {{subsequently}} {{shifted to}} the eastern edifice. Around 5150 ± 1250 BCE as obtained by surface exposure dating, the Tumbres-Talabre lava flow was erupted from the eastern crater. This flow extends 8 km northwest and is 20 - 30 m thick. The Tumbres-Talabre flow was originally considered to be of late 19th century age. It probably formed {{when one of the}} craters filled with andesitic lava to the point of overflow. The three eastern <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> formed at the time when the Tumbres-Talabre flow was erupted in remains of the stage I cone.

40|$|Volcanic {{activity}} at the <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> of Mt. Etna includes phreatic eruptions which jeopardize tourists and other people who sporadically approach {{the top of the}} volcano. To date no appreciable precursors of this kind of activity are known. Solely intermittent volcanic tremor might be considered a short-term seismic forerunner. The pattern of volcanic tremor amplitude at Mt. Etna during springtime 1987 was investigated and revealed significant periodicities before both phreatic explosions occurring at the <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> during that time span. Results are in agreement with a boiling mechanism as the source of intermittent volcanic tremor, even if the lack of data on the ground water table in {{the upper part of the}} volcano did not allow the formulation of quantitative models...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, lunar mare domes (LMDs) are {{classified}} according to morphologic and morphometric (primarily diameter) characteristics, and consideration {{is given to}} their origin and role in lunar surface processes. In general, they occur either as low, flat, circular structures with convex shapes, slopes less than about 5 deg, and display <b>summit</b> <b>craters,</b> or as irregular structures often adjacent to highland regions and rarely containing <b>summit</b> <b>craters.</b> It is found that LMDs originate through extrusion of lavas through vents to produce low lava shields, or through flooding and draping of preexisting topography to produce kipukas and irregular domes. Smooth, vent-related mare domes range from about 3 - 17 km in diameter and up to several hundred meters in elevation; they are similar in morphology to small terrestrial lava shields...|$|R
25|$|The 2009 {{eruption}} of Redoubt Volcano continues. A lava dome is currently {{growing in the}} <b>summit</b> <b>crater,</b> accompanied by intermittent emissions of volcanic gases and minor amounts of ash. Additional explosive events are likely and could send ash to greater than 30,000 feet above sea level. Such a cycle of dome growth and explosive dome destruction may continue for many months. The potential for lahars (volcanic mudflows) and other flooding down the Drift River Valley remains, as does the potential for trace to minor ash fall on communities near Redoubt (e.g., the Kenai Peninsula Borough, The Municipality of Anchorage, and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, and possibly more distant areas).|$|E
25|$|Large volcano-associated debris flows {{known as}} lahars {{pose a threat}} to {{populated}} areas downstream from glaciated volcanoes. Although lahars are typically associated with the effects of volcanic eruptions, they can occur whenever conditions allow collapse and movement of mud originating from existing volcanic ash deposits. Melting snow and ice, intense rainfall or the breakout of a <b>summit</b> <b>crater</b> lake can all generate lahars. Landslides at Mount Meager may also be indirectly related to climate change. Several tension cracks extend up to the summit, and as global warming causes glaciers to melt, the meltwater reaches deep into the massif. It then flows along the ruptured surfaces making these landslide zones.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 Redoubt {{eruption}} {{began with}} a series of large explosions on March 22–23, followed by less-energetic dome growth in the <b>summit</b> <b>crater.</b> On April 4, another large explosion occurred, which was in turn followed by growth of the current dome. There will likely be additional explosive events during the coming days to months, but their exact nature, as well as timing, remains uncertain. Because the dome sits at the lip of a steep slope leading out of the crater it can become unstable, and (as in 1990) collapse into the Drift River valley, producing avalanches of hot lava blocks, pyroclastic flows, lahars, and ash columns tens of thousands of feet tall, which can carry ash to Alaska communities. During periods between explosions, residents and pilots may also notice occasional sulfur smell and hazy conditions due to low-level ash and volcanic gas emissions.|$|E
50|$|The chain {{began to}} form {{approximately}} 2 million years ago, and the volcanic activity {{that formed the}} range only stopped about 10,000 years ago. The majority of the cones were formed by Strombolian eruptions, and these cones usually have well-defined <b>summit</b> <b>craters.</b> Some have nested craters, and others show broken rims where lava poured through.|$|R

[...] It is easily visited from San José, with a road leading {{right up to the}} <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> and a weekly bus service to the top. It is thus a popular tourist spot. The summit of the volcano also houses a few television transmitters for television stations in San José.|$|R
50|$|Mt. Stromboli {{has been}} in almost {{continuous}} eruption for the past 2,000 years. A pattern of eruption is maintained in which explosions occur at the <b>summit</b> <b>craters,</b> with mild to moderate eruptions of incandescent volcanic bombs, at intervals ranging from minutes to hours.

Eruptions from the <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> typically result in a few short, mild, but energetic bursts, ranging up to a few hundred meters in height, containing ash, incandescent lava fragments and stone blocks. Stromboli's activity is almost exclusively explosive, but lava flows do occur at times when volcanic activity is high: an effusive eruption occurred in 2002, the first in 17 years, and again in 2003, 2007, and 2013-14. Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a Multi-Component Gas Analyzer System, which detects pre-eruptive degassing of rising magma, improving prediction of volcanic activity.|$|R

40|$|The {{preservation}} of morphologically fresh lava flows which pre-date {{the most recent}} episodes of caldera collapse at the summits of Ascraeus, Arsia and Olympus Montes indicates that explosive eruptions were not associated with this stage of Tharsis shield volcanism. The existence of resurfaced floor segments, complex wrinkle ridges, and lava terraces within the <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> suggests that lava lakes comprised the dominant form of the intra-caldera activity. Multiple collapse episodes on Ascraeus and Olympus Montes are indicated by the nested <b>summit</b> <b>craters.</b> The most plausible cause of caldera collapse appears to be large-scale sub-terminal effusive activity, which is corroborated by the previously recognized existence of large lava flows on the flanks of these volcanoes. Due to the implied sequence of large-scale explosive (silicic) volcanism followed by effusive (basaltic) activity, it appears highly unlikely that ignimbrites {{or other forms of}} pyroclastic flows (previously proposed as possible deposits within the Olympus Mons aureole material) were ever erupted from the Tharsis Montes...|$|R
40|$|Volcanoes {{contribute}} to atmospheric pollution {{by increasing the}} amount of reactive and greenhouse gases and aerosols, making volcanic emissions one of the major natural sources of several trace elements to the atmosphere. In particular, Mt. Etna is considered to be, on the long-term average, the major atmospheric point source of many environmental harmful compounds. Their emission occurs in the form of gases, aerosols or particulate, both through continuous passive degassing from open-conduit activity and through sporadic paroxysmal eruptive activity. To estimate the environmental impact of magma-derived trace metals and their depositions processes, five bulk collectors have been deployed at various altitudes on the upper flanks around the <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> of the volcano. Samples were collected every second week for a period of one year and analyzed for the main chemical-physical parameters (electric conductivity and pH) and for major and trace elements concentrations. The first data obtained clearly show that the volcanic contribution is always prevailing in the sampling site closest to the <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> (∼ 1. 5 km). In the distal sites (5. 5 - 10 km from the summit) downwind of the <b>summit</b> <b>craters,</b> the volcanic contribution is also detectable but often overwhelmed by anthropogenic or other natural (seawater spray, geogenic dust) contributions. Volcanic contribution may derive from both dry and wet deposition of gases and aerosols from the volcanic plume, but sometimes also from leaching of freshly emitted volcanic ashes. In fact, in our background site (7. 5 km in the upwind direction,) volcanic contribution has been detected only following an ash deposition event. Fluorine, S and Cl, are the major elements that prevailingly characterize the volcanic contribution in bulk deposition on Mt. Etna, but high concentrations of many trace elements are also detected in the studied samples. In particular, Si, Al, Fe, Ti, Cu, As, Rb, Pb, Tl, Cd, Cr, U and Ag display, in the site most exposed to the volcanic emissions, median concentration values about two orders of magnitude higher than those measured in our background site. Furthermore some of the analysed elements display very high enrichment values with respect to the average crust and, in the closest site to the <b>summit</b> <b>craters,</b> also deposition values higher than those measured in polluted urban or industrial sites...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the reactivation and the successive {{evolution of the}} shallow plumbing system of Mt. Etna {{between the end of}} the largest flank eruption of the last three centuries (1991 – 1993) and the subterminal eruption from South-East Crater (SEC), which occurred between February and mid-November 1999. Our analysis is based on observations of the volcanic activity and petrological studies of the erupted volcanics. Bulk rock, mineral and glass compositions have been determined for more than 80 samples erupted from the four <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> between October 1995 and February 1999. These data allow us to recognise significant compositional variations among the products of different craters. In particular, volcanics produced between 1995 and 1999 by Bocca Nuova (BN), Voragine (VOR) and North-East Crater (NEC) show limited compositional variations and are similar to those observed during recent eruptions (e. g., 1991 – 93). More primitive magmas have been produced during the more vigorous fire fountains episodes. On the contrary, the South-East Crater produced slightly more differentiated volcanics than those of the other <b>summit</b> <b>craters</b> following its reactivation (November 1996) until the end of 1998. Whole rock compositions of products from this crater show low CaO/Al 2 O 3, whereas interstitial glasses have lower MgO and higher alkali contents than those from the other craters. However, since the beginning of 1999, and just {{before the start of the}} subterminal eruption from SEC, the volcanics erupted from this crater progressively changed in composition, becoming similar to those of the other craters. This trend indicates that within the conduits of the <b>summit</b> <b>craters,</b> distinct thermal and fluid-dynamical regimes can evolve, controlling the cooling and crystallisation of Etna magmas...|$|R
