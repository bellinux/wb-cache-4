5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle, Dinah faces off against her former friend, accidentally decapitating Edaniel in the process. An enraged Edrear {{attempts}} to kill her, but eventually halts when Dinah {{points out that}} he's crying for his brother, something that he's normally unable to do and that's being caused by Maphohetka's influence. Knowing that he's been compromised, Edrear stabs himself with his own sword, leaving Dinah to mourn him and share one kiss. Maphohetka, taking the opportunity, destroys Dinah's scythe (the only thing <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> could potentially kill her) and ends up mutating into a large monster. After Dinah is captured in Maphohetka's body, she happens upon the entity's core, which is Maphohetka's decayed corpse. Using Eniri's bracelet to see into the monster, she finds that {{a piece of the}} cross Maphohetka was stabbed with during her hanging is still lodged in her chest, allowing Dinah to conclude that the piece is what keeps the evil spirit anchored in the living world. Dinah removes the cross shard, causing Maphohetka to fade away.|$|E
500|$|... "On , I {{really just}} wanted to put the mirror back onto the whole experience. You can see that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> kind of confidence. And, literally, every take became a more and more {{confident}} take, {{so that she could}} have fun with what was going on. Not being over-the-top sarcastic, but ... having a laugh at everything that was going on around her, with confidence. [...] The very last dance of the piece, she had her hair up, and I go, 'Can you just do one for me with your hair down?' She dropped her hair down. You'll see we intercut with her hair up and her hair down. That was the last piece. She just rocked it from her heart. She choreographed that last dance at the very end. She did that on her own and said, 'Let's go for it'".|$|E
500|$|Director Csupó {{stated that}} they had no actors {{initially}} in mind for the film. The first actor cast was AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie Burke. Robb wrote Csupó [...] "such a beautiful, heartwarming letter" [...] that expressed her love for the book and the character. Csupó said that he cast her because of [...] "her letter, her enthusiasm, and her love of the material". Robb also conversed with producer Lauren Levine before casting even began, and [...] "their conversation convinced her that, without a doubt, AnnaSophia was meant for this role". Levine said that [...] "it was just so clear in talking to her about all this fantasy that I was basically talking to Leslie, that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> same kind of spark and magical presence. She might be physically different from Leslie in the book, but the spirit of Leslie and the spirit of AnnaSophia are nearly identical. It was a match made in heaven." [...] With regard to the character, Robb said [...] "'s one of those people who's just always lit up, who has this glow about her, and no one can bring her down. Leslie's such a lively and energetic character, it was really fun for me to become her." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>She</b> <b>has</b> said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a lot {{of respect}} for German supermodel Heidi Klum. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> stated <b>that</b> it was hard for her to find jobs because she was just lost in a sea of blond-haired, blue-eyed models.|$|R
2500|$|On June 10, 1995, a 13-year-old {{girl from}} Pinellas Park, Florida, died shortly after riding Kumba, {{due to a}} rare heart {{condition}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> triggered a heart attack. [...] Her mother sued the park and won a judgment of $500,000. [...] The jury cited the park for failing to administer CPR {{in a timely manner}} and slowing rescue efforts. [...] The jury also cited the mother as 30% responsible for the victim's death, thereby reducing the award amount to $350,000. [...] Reasons given were the mother's previous drug abuse possibly contributing to the victim's health problems.|$|E
2500|$|Queen {{has also}} {{recorded}} salsa tracks, beginning in 2005 with [...] "Amiga No Pienses" [...] and [...] "Yo Lamento", and in 2007 with [...] "Si Eres Tú" [...] which she recorded in a [...] "big-band Salsa" [...] style. She worked with salsa singers La India on [...] "Cuando Hieres A Una Mujer" [...] and Víctoria Sanabría on [...] "No Te Quiero". Ivy Queen cites Celia Cruz, La Lupe, and other [...] "classic Salsa singers" [...] as inspirations for her style of hip-hop music. Her main influence is Selena, {{to whom she}} pays tribute on her fifth studio album Flashback with a [...] "reggaeton-ed up twist" [...] on [...] "Si Una Vez". She also said she enjoyed the songs [...] "Como La Flor" [...] and [...] "La Carcacha". Queen told Ramiro Burr of the Houston Chronicle, [...] "I admired Selena because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> famous crossover success, but sadly she never got to enjoy it," [...] she said. According to Allmusic, she takes influences from Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Gloria Estefan, Madonna and Salt-N-Pepa. Reggaetón duo Jowell & Randy cite Queen {{as one of their}} musical influences. Queen is also a musical influence for American rappers Bia and Cardi B.|$|E
2500|$|Debnam-Carey was {{surprised}} by the attention. She was new to Twitter and Instagram, and did not know what shipping (the desire by fans for two people or fictional characters to be in a romantic or platonic relationship) meant; she saw that fans had given the pairing the portmanteau [...] "Clexa". [...] "I was on Instagram or something and I checked my tagged photos, and I realized that suddenly they were all LGBT artwork. I was like, 'Oh, my god!' I had no idea. It was the first time I realized I was a figure for that community," [...] said Debnam-Carey. She called this [...] "an honor" [...] and [...] "flattering," [...] and added, [...] "It's new for our society, as well. It's one of the first shows that really has two characters in the cast that are gender and sexually fluid and embraces that. There are no labels. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of. I'm all for it." [...] While at Paleyfest 2016, she was made aware of fans raising money in her name for The Trevor Project, an organization for LGBT teenagers in need, and the fact that, at the time, $46,000 dollars had been raised. When asked if she knew <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> much of an impact on the LGBT community, Debnam-Carey commented, [...] "Not that much, no, that's amazing." [...] As of July 13, 2016, over $135,000 dollars have been raised.|$|E

6000|$|... "I think not," [...] {{answered}} the nurse {{in a low}} voice. [...] "I think <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> which will not let her die"--a saying that puzzled the Prioress at this time.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is there," [...] she said, {{with that}} {{deliberate}} attempt at clearness {{which was one}} of her antipathetic qualities for Melville--"what is there <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> offers, that I----?" ...|$|R

60|$|PETKOFF. Not {{engaged to}} you, you scoundrel! Why, you had twenty-five levas from {{me on the}} day of your betrothal; and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> gilt {{bracelet}} from Miss Raina.|$|E
60|$|She nodded. She {{was very}} calm and self-contained; but his lordship {{observed}} {{that she was}} unusually pale, though considering what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> day undergone this afforded no matter for wonder.|$|E

60|$|I {{said that}} Ma had said {{afterwards}} (and so <b>she</b> <b>had),</b> <b>that</b> great-uncle Chopper's gift was a shabby one; but she hadn't said a bad one. She {{had called it}} shabby, electrotyped, second-hand, and below his income.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth Garrow was a {{very good}} girl, but it might almost be a {{question}} whether she was not too good. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> learned, or thought <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> learned, <b>that</b> most girls are vapid, silly, and useless,--given chiefly to pleasure-seeking and a hankering after lovers; and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> resolved <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would not be such a one.|$|R

60|$|She was {{abreast of}} it now and I thought that she would stop again; but no! She swerved rigidly--at the moment {{there was no one}} near her; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> bit of {{pavement}} to herself--with inanimate slowness as if moved by something outside herself.|$|E
