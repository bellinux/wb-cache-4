60|$|This new enemy's {{attack was}} simple, {{straightforward}} violence. It {{was not the}} slimy, underhand plotting to deliver her up like a slave, which had sickened her heart and had made her feel in her loneliness that her oppressors were too many for her. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> {{alone in the world}} now.
