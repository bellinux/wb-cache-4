5|$|Ballistics is {{a futuristic}} racing {{computer}} game developed by Grin {{and published by}} Xicat Interactive in 2001. Grin developed an arcade version of the game, released in 2002 featuring a unique reclined <b>seating</b> <b>position</b> cabinet by Triotech. Players race across seven different tracks in various leagues against other competitors on high-speed hoverbikes.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, {{the company}} {{introduced}} the 860 GT, designed by noted car stylist Giorgetto Giugiaro. Its angular lines were unique, but raised handlebars made for an uncomfortable <b>seating</b> <b>position</b> {{at high speeds}} and also caused steering issues.|$|E
25|$|A refined {{version of}} the FVA-1 was {{produced}} as the FVA-2 Blaue Maus (Blue Mouse). This aircraft followed the arrangement and construction of the FVA-1, with a lower <b>seating</b> <b>position</b> to reduce drag, increased span/area to reduce wing loading and reduced empty weight. Several were produced to order {{and at least one}} of these aircraft was fitted with a wheeled undercarriage replacing the main skids and one other was used by Wolfgang Klemperer to research glider launching from balloons. The attempt was unsuccessful as the aircraft entered a flat spin and did not recover before hitting the ground.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of <b>seat</b> <b>position</b> on handrim biomechanics. Thirteen experienced users propelled a wheelchair over a smooth level floor at a self-selected speed. Kinetic and temporal-distance data were collected {{with the use of}} an instrumented rim and a motion analysis system. A custom-designed axle was used to change the <b>seat</b> <b>position.</b> We used repeated measures analysis of variance to evaluate if differences existed in the temporal-distance and kinetic data with change in <b>seat</b> <b>position.</b> Results showed that a shorter distance between the axle and shoulder (low seat height) improved the push time and push angle temporal variables (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Tangential force output did not change with <b>seat</b> <b>position.</b> Axial and radial forces were highest in the lowest <b>seat</b> <b>position</b> (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). Propulsion efficiency as measured by the fraction of effective force did not significantly change with <b>seat</b> <b>position...</b>|$|R

25|$|Prior to the RX public debut, {{a concept}} sport utility vehicle, the SLV, previewed the model at the Chicago Auto Show on 9 February 1997. The SLV name stood for Sport Luxury Vehicle. The production-ready concept {{combined}} {{the characteristics of}} an SUV, wagon, and sedan, and featured high-ground clearance and an elevated <b>seating</b> <b>position.</b> The concept's overall design intent was to be commonly used for suburban driving. At the debut of the concept vehicle, {{it was reported that}} the crossover was {{to be based on the}} ES 300 sedan, and would go into production with an entry-level price of over US$30,000.|$|E
25|$|When {{the dummy}} has been {{determined}} {{to be ready for}} testing, calibration marks are fastened {{to the side of the}} head to aid researchers when slow-motion films are reviewed later. The dummy is then placed inside the test vehicle, set to <b>seating</b> <b>position</b> and then marked on either the head and knees. Up to fifty-eight data channels located in all parts of the Hybrid III, from the head to the ankle, record between 30000 and 35000 data items in a typical 100–150millisecond crash. Recorded in a temporary data repository in the dummy's chest, these data are downloaded to computer once the test is complete.|$|E
25|$|Domenico di Bartolo's Madonna of humility, {{painted in}} 1433, was {{described}} by art historian Andrew Ladis {{as one of the}} most innovative devotional images from the early Renaissance. The formal symmetry of the strips below her feet and those hovering above her express the symbolic duality of her nature: an earthly woman, as well as a heavenly queen. Despite the low <b>seating</b> <b>position,</b> the star and the gems as well as the halo signify her regal status. In this painting, which is at the Pinoteca Nazionale in Siena, Domenico does not use cast shadows as he does in other works such as the Madonna Enthroned.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, {{the first}} mass-produced {{mountain}} bike appeared, {{intended for use}} off-pavement over a variety of surfaces. It was an immediate success, and examples flew off retailers' shelves during the 1980s, their popularity spurred by the novelty of all-terrain cycling and the increasing desire of urban dwellers to escape their surroundings via mountain biking and other extreme sports. These cycles featured sturdier frames, wider tires with large knobs for increased traction, a more upright <b>seating</b> <b>position</b> (to allow better visibility and shifting of body weight), and increasingly, various front and rear suspension designs. By 2000, mountain bike sales had far outstripped that of racing, sport/racer, and touring bicycles.|$|E
25|$|The {{criminal}} charges {{focused on the}} car's steering column, which {{was found to have}} sheared off at a point where a modification had been made. The prosecution alleged that the column had failed causing the accident and the Williams team conceded to this failure, but only as caused by the impact at the Tamburello corner. Senna had not liked the position of his FW16's steering wheel relative to the <b>seating</b> <b>position</b> and had asked for the former to be changed. Head and Adrian Newey satisfied Senna's request by having the existing column cut and extended with a smaller-diameter piece of tubing, which was welded together with reinforcing plates. The modification was carried out in this manner as {{there was no time to}} manufacture a new longer steering column in time for the race.|$|E
25|$|Dual zone {{climate control}} was a {{standard}} feature across the WH range, as was 12-mode trip computer {{integrated into the}} instrument cluster. Caprice including rear roof mounted climate control and stereo controls for rear passengers- rear passengers were also provided with two headphone jacks in the rear parcel shelf and could listen to a different audio source to the front occupants. A rear flip down table was incorporated into the rear armrest, complete with storage pocket and cup holders. The exclusive-to-Caprice options included standard Howe leather seats, 260-watt 12-speaker DSP audio system, individual ignition key memory (not available in Statesman- stereo settings, <b>seating</b> <b>position)</b> for three drivers, upright Holden crest logo on the bonnet, chrome exterior door handles, as well as heated side view mirrors and auto dipping passenger side view mirror to avoid alloy wheel damage when reversing. Headlights could be set to automatically sense low light levels and turn on without driver input. Caprice featured a fine chrome vertical bar grille, while Statesman used a chrome matrix style front grille design, and lacked chrome exterior door handles.|$|E

500|$|Next was Randy Orton {{defending}} his WWE Championship against Triple H and John Cena in a triple threat match, {{which is a}} standard match involving three wrestlers with no disqualifications. For his entrance, Cena had the Jones High School Marching Tigers marching band perform an instrumental version of his theme song [...] "The Time Is Now" [...] live. During the match, when Triple H had held Orton in a sleeper hold, Cena picked up both Orton and Triple H for an FU, but Triple H dropped down and low blowed him. Orton then dominated the match for some time; one highlight of the match featured Orton performing a crossbody from the top rope on Cena, while the latter was held on Triple H's shoulders in a <b>seating</b> <b>position.</b> Orton also performed an DDT to both Cena and Triple H simultaneously. Orton then tried to perform an RKO on Cena, but he countered and threw Orton onto Triple H. Triple H then started targeting Orton's legs and using some submissions on him. The match {{came to an end}} when Cena had Triple H on his shoulders for the FU, but was countered into a Pedigree. As Triple H was in the pin, Orton punted Triple H and pinned Cena to win the match and retain the WWE Championship.|$|E

5000|$|Eight-way powered, {{dual stage}} heated front seats, with two setting memory {{functions}} for both front occupants to retain {{positions of power}} adjustable steering column and <b>seat</b> <b>position</b> for driver; and <b>seat</b> <b>position</b> for front passenger. The seat heaters were standard on the 560 SEL/SEC, and an option on other models. Later-production (post-facelift) models so equipped had higher wattage heated seats, as compared to earlier models.|$|R
2500|$|Chair design {{considers}} intended usage, ergonomics (how comfortable {{it is for}} the occupant), as well as non-ergonomic {{functional requirements}} such as size, stacking ability, folding ability, weight, durability, stain resistance, and artistic design. Intended usage determines the desired <b>seating</b> <b>position.</b> [...] "Task chairs", or any chair intended for people to work at a desk or table, including dining chairs, can only recline very slightly; otherwise the occupant is too far away from the desk or table. Dental chairs are necessarily reclined. Easy chairs for watching television or movies are somewhere in between depending on the height of the screen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lower part}} of the GT-1's nose was {{constructed}} from a drop tank, with the upper part fabricated from fiberglass that was laid up using the drop tank as a mold. The landing gear is a retractable monowheel. The aircraft was initially fitted with a bubble canopy. Later the fuselage was modified to allow a more reclined pilot <b>seating</b> <b>position</b> and the canopy replaced with a more streamlined one. The modifications added [...] to the glider's empty weight and the gross weight was raised [...] in partial compensation. The GT-1's [...] span wing employs a NACA 43012A airfoil. The initial glide ratio was 29:1, but extensive work gap-filling and contouring the aircraft raised this to 33:1.|$|E
2500|$|The Fauvettes's {{fuselage}} {{is built}} in three parts. [...] The nose section, with a moulded plastic foam shell over a steel frame contains the cockpit, which {{is covered by}} a high, one-piece canopy over the upright <b>seating</b> <b>position,</b> giving the Fauvette a somewhat humpbacked look. [...] The centre section also has a steel frame, covered by moulded polystyrene; wings, cockpit and twin fuselage side towing hooks are attached to this frame. Behind the cockpit the upper fuselage line is formed with a polystyrene fairing which overlaps the conical rear fuselage, made of ply-foam sandwich. [...] The V-tail is straight-tapered with sweep on both edges. [...] The fixed surfaces are ply-foam sandwich structures, carrying fabric covered control surfaces. [...] The Fauvette has a fixed, monowheel undercarriage, assisted by a tailskid.|$|E
40|$|Pre-oxygenation in the <b>seated</b> (sitting) <b>position</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with better oxygenation. This randomised, cross over study compared oxygenation in the supine position with that in the 45 ° <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> in 40 young, healthy volunteers. Oxygen was administered through a circle system and tight fitting facemask. Transcutaneous Po(2) levels were recorded at 10 -s intervals from two measurement points during 4  min of oxygenation in the two positions. The mean (SD) values of 12 measurements taken between the third and fourth minute were recorded. There was no difference in the increase in tissue oxygenation when comparing the supine and <b>seated</b> <b>positions</b> (32. 7 (7. 3) vs 32. 6 (6. 7) kPa, respectively). We conclude that {{there is no evidence that}} pre-oxygenation in the 45 ° <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> improves tissue oxygenation in young healthy volunteers compared with the supine position...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} recovery protocols on heart rate recovery (HRR) trend through fitted heart rate (HR) decay curves were assessed. Twenty one trained male athletes and 19 sedentary male students performed a submaximal cycle exercise test on four occasions followed by 5 min: 1) inactive {{recovery in the}} upright <b>seated</b> <b>position,</b> 2) active (cycling) recovery in the upright <b>seated</b> <b>position,</b> 3) supine position, and 4) supine position with elevated legs. The HRR was assessed as {{the difference between the}} peak exercise HR and the HR recorded following 60 seconds of recovery (HRR 60). Additionally the time constant decay was obtained by fitting the 5 minute post-exercise HRR into a first-order exponential curve. Within- subject differences of HRR 60 for all recovery protocols in both groups were significant (p 0. 05). Values of HRR 60 were larger in the group of athletes for all conditions (p 0. 05). Between group difference was found for active recovery in the <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> and the supine position with elevated legs (p < 0. 05). We conclude that the supine position with or without elevated legs accelerated HRR compared with the two <b>seated</b> <b>positions.</b> Active recovery in the <b>seated</b> upright <b>position</b> was associated with slower HRR compared with inactive recovery in the same position. The HRR in athletes was accelerated in the supine position with elevated legs and with active recovery in the <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> compared with non-athlete...|$|R

2500|$|Because of {{the high}} {{centrifugal}} forces encountered during drifting, drivers are usually retained by a racing seat and five-point harness. This allows the hands to merely turn the wheel, instead of bracing {{the body in the}} seat. The same applies for the feet, which are free to move rapidly between clutch, brake and accelerator pedals. The steering wheel is usually relatively small, dished, and perfectly round, {{so that it can be}} released and allowed to spin through the hands as the caster returns the front wheels to center. The locking knob on the hand brake is usually replaced with a spin turn knob; this stops the hand brake locking on when pulled. Nearly all drivers move the hand brake location or add an extra hydraulic hand brake actuator for greater braking force. Additional gauges used to monitor boost levels, oil pressure and temperature, intake and coolant temperatures, air-fuel ratio (also called λ, or [...] "lambda" [...] ratio), etc. Some drivers, especially in larger cars, move the <b>seating</b> <b>position</b> for a better weight distribution, such as Daigo Saito's 2014 JZX100 Mk.II Chaser.|$|E
