25|$|Benefits aside, however, {{orlistat}} is {{notorious for}} its gastrointestinal side effects (sometimes {{referred to as}} treatment effects), which can include <b>steatorrhea</b> (oily, loose stools). They decrease with time, however, and are the most frequently reported adverse effects of the drug. In Australia, the United States and the European Union, orlistat is available for sale without a prescription. Over-the-counter approval was controversial in the United States, with consumer advocacy group Public Citizen repeatedly opposing it on safety and efficacy grounds. Generic formulations of orlistat are available in some countries. In Australia it is listed as an S3 medication and so is available over the counter in pharmacies.|$|E
25|$|Intestinal gas is {{composed}} of varying quantities of exogenous sources and endogenous sources. The exogenous gases are swallowed (aerophagia) when eating or drinking or increased swallowing during times of excessive salivation (as might occur when nauseated or {{as the result of}} gastroesophageal reflux disease). The endogenous gases are produced either as a by-product of digesting certain types of food, or of incomplete digestion, as is the case during <b>steatorrhea.</b> Anything that causes food to be incompletely digested by the stomach or small intestine may cause flatulence when the material arrives in the large intestine, due to fermentation by yeast or prokaryotes normally or abnormally present in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial {{overgrowth}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms, {{many of which are}} also found in other conditions, making the diagnosis challenging at times. Many of the symptoms are due to malabsorption of nutrients due to the effects of bacteria which either metabolize nutrients or cause inflammation of the small bowel, impairing absorption. The symptoms of bacterial overgrowth include nausea, flatus, constipation, bloating, abdominal distension, abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhea, fatigue, and weakness. SIBO also causes an increased permeability of the small intestine. Some patients may lose weight. Children with bacterial overgrowth may develop malnutrition and have difficulty attaining proper growth. <b>Steatorrhea,</b> a sticky type of diarrhea where fats are not properly absorbed and spill into the stool, may also occur.|$|E

2500|$|Liquid stool is more {{difficult}} to control than formed, solid stool. Hence, FI can be exacerbated by diarrhea. Some consider diarrhea to be the most common aggravating factor. [...] Orlistat is an anti-obesity (weight loss) drug that blocks the absorption of fats. This may give side effects of FI, diarrhea and <b>steatorrhea.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Another drug, orlistat, blocks {{absorption}} of dietary fats, {{and as a}} result may cause oily spotting bowel movements (<b>steatorrhea),</b> oily stools, stomach pain, and flatulence. [...] A similar medication designed for patients with Type 2 diabetes is Acarbose; which partially blocks {{absorption of}} carbohydrates in the small intestine, and produces similar side effects including stomach pain and flatulence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract can be damaged following abdominal and pelvic radiotherapy. [...] Atrophy, fibrosis and vascular changes produce malabsorption, diarrhea, <b>steatorrhea</b> and bleeding with bile acid diarrhea and vitamin B12 malabsorption commonly found due to ileal involvement. [...] Pelvic radiation disease includes radiation proctitis, producing bleeding, diarrhoea and urgency, {{and can also}} cause radiation cystitis when the bladder is affected.|$|E
2500|$|Orlistat (Xenical) reduces {{intestinal}} fat absorption by inhibiting pancreatic lipase. [...] Some side-effects {{of using}} Orlistat include frequent, oily bowel movements (<b>steatorrhea).</b> But if {{fat in the}} diet is reduced, symptoms often improve. [...] Originally available only by prescription, it {{was approved by the}} FDA for over-the-counter sale in February 2007. On 26 May 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a revised label for Xenical to include new safety information about cases of severe liver injury that have been reported rarely with the use of this medication. [...] Of the 40 million users of Orlistat worldwide, 13 cases of severe liver damage have been reported.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary side}} effects of the drug are gastrointestinal-related, and include <b>steatorrhea</b> (oily, loose stools with {{excessive}} flatus due to unabsorbed fats reaching the large intestine), fecal incontinence and frequent or urgent bowel movements. GlaxoSmithKline recommends that all users be cautious of the possible side effects until they [...] "have a sense of any treatment effects". To minimize these effects, foods with high fat content should be avoided; the manufacturer advises consumers to follow a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet. Oily stools and flatulence can be controlled by reducing the dietary fat content to somewhere {{in the region of}} 15grams per meal. The manual for Alli makes it clear that orlistat treatment involves aversion therapy, encouraging the user to associate eating fat with unpleasant treatment effects.|$|E

50|$|<b>Steatorrhea</b> (or steatorrhoea) is the {{presence}} of excess fat in feces. Stools may be bulky and difficult to flush, have a pale and oily appearance and can be especially foul-smelling. An oily anal leakage or some level of fecal incontinence may occur. There is increased fat excretion, which can be measured by determining the fecal fat level. The definition of how much fecal fat constitutes <b>steatorrhea</b> has not been standardized.|$|E

50|$|As {{with any}} ileal resection, a {{possible}} complication is mild <b>steatorrhea</b> {{due to a}} reduced uptake of bile acids by the ileum.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the absence}} of bile, fats become indigestible and are instead {{excreted}} in feces, a condition called <b>steatorrhea.</b> Feces lack their characteristic brown color and instead are white or gray, and greasy. [...] <b>Steatorrhea</b> can lead to deficiencies in essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins. In addition, past the small intestine (which is normally responsible for absorbing fat from food) the gastrointestinal tract and gut flora are not adapted to processing fats, leading to problems in the large intestine.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, the fecal fat test is a {{diagnostic}} test for fat malabsorption conditions, {{which lead to}} excess fat in the feces (<b>steatorrhea).</b>|$|E

50|$|Steatocrit or Acid steatocrit is a simple, rapid {{gravimetric}} method to determine <b>steatorrhea.</b> The test is simple, rapid, inexpensive, and reliable. It is a qualitative test {{that can be}} used when other methods are impractical.|$|E
50|$|The {{inability}} to absorb {{fat in the}} ileum will result in <b>steatorrhea,</b> or fat in the stool. As a result, this can be clinically diagnosed when foul-smelling stool is encountered. Low levels of plasma chylomicron are also characteristic.|$|E
5000|$|Steatorrhea: Frequent, oily, foul-smelling bowel movements. Damage to the {{pancreas}} reduces {{the production of}} pancreatic enzymes that aid digestion, which can result in malnutrition. Fats and nutrients are not absorbed properly, leading to loose, greasy stool known as <b>steatorrhea.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other markers {{which may}} be {{measured}} and monitored are a complete blood count, serum liver enzymes, bilirubin levels (usually grossly elevated), kidney function, and electrolytes. Fecal fat measurement is occasionally ordered when symptoms of malabsorption (e.g., gross <b>steatorrhea)</b> are prominent.|$|E
50|$|Consuming escolar and oilfish (sometimes called butterfish) {{will often}} cause <b>steatorrhea,</b> also {{referred}} to as Gempylotoxism or Gempylid Fish Poisoning or keriorrhea.

5000|$|Escolar's wax ester content {{can cause}} keriorrhea (Greek: flow of wax), gempylotoxism or gempylid fish poisoning. [...] Symptoms range from stomach cramps to rapid loose bowel movements, {{occurring}} 30 minutes to 36 hours following consumption. This condition {{may also be}} referred to as <b>steatorrhea.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{elevated}} steatocrit {{is indicative}} of fat malabsorption resulting in <b>steatorrhea.</b> The generally resulting from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency but can also occur with severe small bowel disease i. e. celiac disease, liver diseases such as Primary Biliary Cirrhosis and medications inhibiting fat absorption such as orlistat.|$|E

50|$|Like olestra, {{jojoba oil}} is edible but non-caloric and non-digestible, meaning the oil will pass {{out of the}} {{intestines}} unchanged and can cause a stool condition called <b>steatorrhea.</b> It also contains approximately 12.1% of the fatty acid Erucic acid that would appear to have toxic effects on the heart at high enough doses (were it digestible).|$|E
50|$|Orlistat (also {{known by}} trade names Xenical and Alli) is a diet pill that works by {{blocking}} the enzymes that digest fat. As a result, some fat cannot be absorbed from the gut and is excreted in the feces {{instead of being}} metabolically digested, sometimes causing oily anal leakage. Vytorin (ezetimibe/simvastatin) tablets can cause <b>steatorrhea</b> in some people.|$|E
