25|$|In 1953, {{director}} Elia Kazan {{was looking}} for a substantive actor to play the emotionally complex role of 'Cal Trask', for screenwriter Paul Osborn's adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1952 novel East of Eden. The lengthy novel deals with the story of the Trask and Hamilton families over the course of three generations, focusing especially on the lives of the latter two generations in Salinas Valley, California, from the mid-19th century through the 1910s. In contrast to the book, the film script focused on the last portion of the story, predominantly with the character of Cal. Though he initially seems more aloof and emotionally troubled than his twin brother Aron, Cal is soon seen to be more worldly, business <b>savvy,</b> <b>and</b> even sagacious than their pious and constantly disapproving father (played by Raymond Massey) who seeks to invent a vegetable refrigeration process. Cal is bothered by the mystery of their supposedly dead mother, and discovers she is still alive and a brothel-keeping 'madam'; the part was played by actress Jo Van Fleet.|$|E
500|$|As a {{self-described}} [...] "bleeding-heart conservative", Kemp represented {{a part of}} the suburban Buffalo region known as the Southtowns (that traditionally voted Democratic) in the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1989. He is as fondly remembered for his good hair and handsome looks as for his athletic prowess and political <b>savvy,</b> <b>and</b> was described as having the charisma of the earlier J.F.K. (John F. Kennedy). David Rosenbaum described Kemp as an independent politician who often legislated outside his committees' jurisdictions and often spoke in favor of ideals and principles rather than his party's political platforms. As a supply-sider, he was not a proponent of balanced budgeting and trivialized it while speaking of growth as an economic goal.|$|E

[...] She was a woman in charge of her own life, which helped her to become the serial's first [...] "sweetheart." [...] Smith told Kingsley that her favourite aspects of Daphne's personality were her confidence and stubborn streak.

500|$|Ellen Page as Ariadne, a {{graduate}} student of architecture who is recruited to construct the various dreamscapes, which are described as mazes. The name Ariadne alludes to a princess of Greek myth, daughter of King Minos, who aided the hero Theseus by giving him a sword and a ball of string to help him navigate the labyrinth which was the prison of the Minotaur. Nolan said that Page was chosen for being a [...] "perfect combination of freshness and <b>savvy</b> <b>and</b> maturity beyond her years". Page said her character acts as a proxy to the audience, as [...] "she's just learning about these ideas and, in essence, assists the audience in learning about dream sharing". Evan Rachel Wood was Christopher Nolan's first choice to play Ariadne, but she turned it down. Before Ellen Page was offered and accepted the role, Nolan considered casting Emily Blunt, Rachel McAdams, Taylor Swift, Emma Roberts, Jessy Schram, and Carey Mulligan.|$|E
500|$|The book {{is divided}} into four sections: one for each {{biography}} and one to provide background context for the conflicts in Rwanda and Bosnia. There are also sections entitled Introduction, Conclusion, Acknowledgments, Source Notes, and Index. The three biographies of the Canadians focus on their involvement in international conflicts through the United Nations, but also includes aspects of their backgrounds and follow events after they leave the UN. In the profiles Off avoids describing places and events but provides a chapter to [...] "a Grapes of Wrath-style description of her two locales". The biographies compare and contrast the strategy and effect of each person's approach to their mission. One reviewer compared the profiles of Dallaire and MacKenzie to Suetonius's biographies of Athenian generals Nicias and Alcibiades. Suetonius portrayed Nicias as honourable, moderate, and effective but over-shadowed by the more vocal and polarizing Alcibiades. Likewise, Off portrayed Dallaire as the more honourable commander but over-shadowed by the more media <b>savvy</b> <b>and</b> callous MacKenzie. Off's focus on moral choices was called [...] "a feminist approach" [...] by {{several members of the}} Department of National Defence.|$|E

Lennertz said, the music is [...] "always done from a sense of being sort of in control and <b>savvy</b> <b>and</b> clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically.

However, Lamb criticized Rihanna for not displaying any sense of originality. Additionally, Lamb compared Rihanna's vocal performance in the song to Beyoncé, writing [...] "The echoes of Beyonce in the higher register are weaker." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised the sample and noted that [...] "SOS" [...] rivals Rihanna's debut single [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] (Music of the Sun, 2005). Despite praising [...] "SOS", Cinquemani continued to write that it was the only song on A Girl Like Me which displayed a high level of [...] "audacity". David Jeffries of AllMusic described [...] "SOS" [...] as a [...] "sexy club tune". [...] Quentin B. Huff of Popmatters was complimentary of the song, writing, [...] "all things considered, '' is a decent song, brimming with energy and perfectly suited to Rihanna’s layered vocals." [...] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone wrote [...] "Barbados-born emigre Rihanna's huge dancehall pop hit last year, [...] "Pon De Replay," [...] was <b>savvy</b> <b>and</b> sexy, and her new smash, [...] "SOS," [...] is even more so.

500|$|In 1947, Feller {{announced}} that he would pitch in the Cuban winter league during the off-season, but Commissioner Chandler ruled no major leaguer could play in Cuba. Feller said he would donate his profits from playing in the Cuban winter league to the American Major League players' pension fund: [...] "I want to prove I'm not going to Cuba for any selfish interest but because there is a principle involved and that is the right of any ball player to work at his chosen profession". Feller also believed it was [...] "grossly unfair" [...] that major leaguers who were U.S. citizens could not play in winter leagues but Latin Americans were permitted. Indians owner and president Bill Veeck said, [...] "I have no comment on Bob's outside activities. I don't know whether they've hurt him or not. But I do know this. The great majority of the people of Cleveland think they've hurt him." [...] Feller's barnstorming business <b>savvy</b> <b>and</b> endorsement details {{made him one of the}} wealthiest players of his time but he claimed his off-season exhibitions and barnstorming were necessary to pay for increased medical expenses for his family. His first wife developed anemia after giving birth to their second child when she was given the wrong type of blood during transfusions; she subsequently became addicted to the prescribed medication for her condition. Feller was trying to make up lost earnings as a result, since he missed out on over $200,000 in salary when he served in the Navy; he missed more than three major league seasons. Feller's biographer John Sickels suggested: [...] "They were trying to make money, but part of it was also, he felt that the black players weren't necessarily getting a fair chance and that he wanted to sort of showcase it. And seeing those, I think, those exhibition games helped people realize that the Negro League players were just as good as the Major League players." ...|$|E
