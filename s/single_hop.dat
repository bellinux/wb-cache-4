25|$|Cooperative {{diversity}} is a cooperative multiple antenna technique for improving or maximising total network channel capacities {{for any given}} set of bandwidths which exploits user diversity by decoding the combined signal of the relayed signal and the direct signal in wireless multihop networks. A conventional <b>single</b> <b>hop</b> system uses direct transmission where a receiver decodes the information only based on the direct signal while regarding the relayed signal as interference, whereas the cooperative diversity considers the other signal as contribution. That is, cooperative diversity decodes {{the information from the}} combination of two signals. Hence, {{it can be seen that}} cooperative {{diversity is}} an antenna diversity that uses distributed antennas belonging to each node in a wireless network. Note that user cooperation is another definition of cooperative diversity. User cooperation considers an additional fact that each user relays the other user's signal while cooperative diversity can be also achieved by multi-hop relay networking systems.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} how multi-hop routing affects the goodput and throughput performances of IEEE 802. 11 distributed coordination function-based wireless networks compared with direct transmission (<b>single</b> <b>hopping),</b> when {{medium access control}} dynamics such as carrier sensing, collisions, retransmissions, and exponential backoff {{are taken into account}} under hidden terminal presence. We propose a semi-Markov chain-based goodput and throughput model for IEEE 802. 11 -based wireless networks, which works accurately with both multi-hopping and <b>single</b> <b>hopping</b> for different network topologies and over a large range of traffic loads. Results show that, under light traffic, there is little benefit of parallel transmissions and both single-hop and multi-hop routing achieve the same end-to-end goodput. Under moderate traffic, concurrent transmissions are favorable as multi-hopping improves the goodput up to 730 % with respect to <b>single</b> <b>hopping</b> for dense networks. At heavy traffic, multi-hopping becomes unstable because of increased packet collisions and network congestion, and single-hopping achieves higher network layer goodput compared with multi-hop routing. As for the link layer throughput is concerned, multi-hopping increases throughput 75 times for large networks, whereas <b>single</b> <b>hopping</b> may become advantageous for small networks. The results point out that the end-to-end goodput can be improved by adaptively switching between <b>single</b> <b>hopping</b> and multi-hopping according to the traffic load and topology...|$|R

40|$|A general multi-orbital Hubbard model, which {{includes}} on-site inter-orbital electron hoppings, is introduced and studied. It is {{shown that the}} on-site inter-orbital <b>single</b> electron <b>hopping</b> {{is one of the}} most basic interactions.

50|$|This type of {{infrastructure}} can be decentralized (with no central server) or centrally managed (with a central server). Both are relatively inexpensive, and can be very reliable and resilient, as each node needs only transmit {{as far as the}} next node. Nodes act as routers to transmit data from nearby nodes to peers that are too far away to reach in a <b>single</b> <b>hop,</b> resulting in a network that can span larger distances. The topology of a mesh network has to be relatively stable, i.e., not too much mobility. If one node drops out of the network, due to hardware failure or any other reason, its neighbors can quickly find another route using a routing protocol.|$|E
50|$|Because Wakatu is a dual-purpose hop, {{it can be}} used in Single Malt and <b>Single</b> <b>Hop</b> (also {{known as}} SMaSH) beer recipes with {{excellent}} results.Because of the middle road that was taken between this hop possessing high aroma and high alpha rating, it has a slightly lower alpha rating than some other hop varieties, generally in the range of 6%-9%. Put simply, this translates to a lower bittering potential when compared to dedicated bittering hops, but also offers the advantage of being able to contribute aromatics to the beer, to which non-dual-purpose bittering hops aren't so well suited.Wakatu hops have a distinct presence of myrcene measured to be at 35.5% or even up to 59%. This contributes subtle flavours akin those of citrus fruit, notably the lime.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} the effect of <b>single</b> leg <b>hop</b> progression and double legs hop progression exercise to increase speed and explosive power of leg muscles. Plyometric is one of the training methods that can increase explosive power. There are many models of plyometric training including <b>single</b> leg <b>hop</b> progression and double leg hop progression. This research was experimental using match subject design techniques. The subjects of this study were 39 students who joined basketball school club. There were 3 groups in this study: Group 1 were 13 students who given sin¬gle leg hop progression exercise, Group 2 were 13 students who given double legs hop progression exercise, Group 3 were 13 students who given conventional exercise. The data was collected during pre test and post test by testing 30 m speed running and vertical jump. The data was analyzed using Analysis of Varians (Anova). It was found that there were significantly increased on speed and explosive power of leg muscles of Group 1 and Group 2. It can be stated that <b>single</b> leg <b>hop</b> progression exercise was more effective than double leg hop progression exercise. The recent findings supported the hypothesis that <b>single</b> leg <b>hop</b> progression and double legs hop progression exercise can increase speed and explosive power of leg muscles. These finding were supported by some previous studies (Singh, et al, 2011; Shallaby, H. K., 2010). The <b>single</b> leg <b>hop</b> progression is more effective than double legs hop progression. This finding was consistent with some previous evidences (McCurdy, et al, 2005; Makaruk et al, 2011) ...|$|R

50|$|For {{data center}} architecture, QFabric creates a single logical switch {{that connects the}} entire data center rather than tiers of {{multiple}} access aggregation and core switches. The reason why this can improve performance is that, instead of going through multiple tiers of switches in a traditional network, packets only get through the infrastructure in a <b>single</b> <b>hop,</b> so this can reduce the delay significantly.For example, a typical switch can handle 200 ports, while QFabric can scale up to 6000 ports with lossless 10Gbps speed.In a QFX3000-M QFabric System, which supports up to 768 10GbE ports, the average end-to-end latency can be as short as 3 microseconds. In QFX3000-G QFabric System, although it supports up to 6,144 10GbE ports, by connecting all nodes in a full-mesh topology, it can achieve an average port-to-port latency of 5 microseconds.|$|E
