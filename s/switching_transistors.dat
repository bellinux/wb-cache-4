50|$|Failure of the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor</b> is common. Due to {{the large}} <b>switching</b> {{voltages}} this <b>transistor</b> must handle (around 325 V for a 230 VAC mains supply), these transistors often short out, in turn immediately blowing the main internal power fuse.|$|R
50|$|Adding a sleep {{transistor}} {{to every}} cell {{that is to}} be turned off imposes a large area penalty, and individually gating the power of every cluster of cells creates timing issues introduced by inter-cluster voltage variation that are difficult to resolve. Fine-grain power gating encapsulates the switching transistor {{as a part of the}} standard cell logic. <b>Switching</b> <b>transistors</b> are designed by either the library IP vendor or standard cell designer. Usually these cell designs conform to the normal standard cell rules and can easily be handled by EDA tools for implementation.|$|E
50|$|Storage {{time can}} be {{eliminated}} and propagation delay can be reduced by keeping the <b>switching</b> <b>transistors</b> from saturating. Schottky transistors prevent saturation and the stored base charge. A Schottky transistor places a Schottky diode between the base and collector of the transistor. As the transistor comes close to saturating, the Schottky diode conducts and shunts any excess base drive to the collector. (This saturation avoidance technique {{is used in the}} 1956 Baker clamp.) The resulting transistors, which do not saturate, are Schottky transistors. The Schottky TTL logic families (such as S and LS) use Schottky transistors in critical places.|$|E

5000|$|When {{used in a}} {{switching}} transformer, one winding of the bifilar coil {{is used as a}} {{means of}} removing the energy stored in the stray magnetic flux which fails to link the primary coil to the secondary coil of the transformer. Because of their proximity, the wires of the bifilar coil both [...] "see" [...] the same stray magnetic flux. One wire is clamped to ground usually by a diode so that when the other [...] "primary" [...] wire of the bifilar coil no longer has a voltage applied across it by the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor,</b> the stray magnetic flux generates a current in the clamping coil with the primary side voltage appearing across it, causing an equal voltage to appear across the primary winding. If this clamping coil was not used, the stray magnetic flux would attempt to force a current to flow through the primary wire. Since the primary wire is switched off and the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor</b> is in a high resistance state, the high voltage which would appear on the semiconductor <b>switching</b> <b>transistor</b> would exceed its electrical breakdown or even damage it.|$|R
5000|$|Another way {{to speed}} up DTL is to avoid saturating the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor.</b> That {{can be done with}} a Baker clamp. The Baker clamp is named for Richard H. Baker, who {{described}} it in his 1956 technical report [...] "Maximum Efficiency Switching Circuits." ...|$|R
50|$|At {{one time}} {{brushless}} DC electric motors used reed switches {{to sense the}} rotor's position relative to the field poles. This allows <b>switching</b> <b>transistors</b> {{to act as a}} commutator, but without the contact problems, wear and electrical noise of a traditional DC commutator. The motor design could also be 'inverted', placing permanent magnets onto the rotor and switching the field through the external, fixed coils. This avoided the need for any rubbing contact to provide power to the rotor. Such motors were used in low-power long-service-life items such as computer cooling fans and disk drives. As cheap Hall effect sensors became available, they replaced the reed switches and gave longer service lifetimes.|$|E
50|$|The {{leakage current}} of logic <b>switching</b> <b>transistors</b> {{increases}} with temperature. In rare instances, this {{may lead to}} thermal runaway in digital circuits. This is not a common problem, since leakage currents usually make up {{a small portion of}} overall power consumption, so the increase in power is fairly modest — for an Athlon 64, the power dissipation increases by about 10% for every 30 degrees Celsius. For a device with a TDP of 100 W, for thermal runaway to occur, the heat sink would have to have a thermal resistivity of over 3 K/W (kelvins per watt), which is about 6 times worse than a stock Athlon 64 heat sink. (A stock Athlon 64 heat sink is rated at 0.34 K/W, although the actual thermal resistance to the environment is somewhat higher, due to the thermal boundary between processor and heatsink, rising temperatures in the case, and other thermal resistances..) Regardless, an inadequate heat sink with a thermal resistance of over 0.5 to 1 K/W would result in the destruction of a 100 W device even without thermal runaway effects.|$|E
50|$|This {{standby voltage}} is {{generated}} by a smaller power supply inside the unit. In older PSU designs, {{it was used to}} supply the voltage regulator, located on the low-voltage side of the transformer, allowing the regulator to measure output voltages. The regulator controls the <b>switching</b> <b>transistors</b> insulated by optocouplers or pulse transformers. The standby power source was a small linear power supply with conventional transformer, which was later changed to a switching power supply, sharing some components of the main unit due to cost- and energy-saving requirements. This 5VSB (Five Volts StandBy) power output feeds devices operating in standby or power off {{is generated by}} this small circuit, which replaced a small conventional transformer or startup circuit for the main voltage regulator, until it can generate power output, in some designs feeding itself and substituting the 5VSB. For this reason, a detected shoutcut may cause to wait up to an hour, until it can successful power up again. This meantime is defined by the grid side located filter capacitors have been discharged by the installed bleeding resistors.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} the control of <b>switching</b> <b>transistors</b> for use in clocked transistor output stages or half/full bridges at fixed working frequencies and a pulse duty factor of about 1 : 1. Clocked output stages in present-day use are mainly implemented with MOS transistors. The disadvantage {{here is that the}} capacitance across the control terminal physically caused by MOS transistors and the resulting capacitor effect prevents a shortening of the switching times. In the invention, the clock or working frequency of <b>switching</b> <b>transistors</b> can be increased. This is achieved by the input capacitance of the MOS transistor forming a resonant circuit in conjunction with an inductance, said resonant circuit being tuned to the working frequency. To obtain floating control, the resident circuit has two coupled coils L 1, L 2 (resonance transformers) via which energy is also transferred. With the described control circuit for <b>switching</b> <b>transistors,</b> clock rates of the order of magnitude of 1 MHz can be implemented using simple technical means...|$|E
50|$|The ASDTIC circuit used {{is based}} around an {{integrator}} and a threshold detector.

30|$|Clock {{feedthrough}} {{caused by}} the <b>switch</b> <b>transistor</b> channel charge and discharge. Larger glitch amplitudes are expected for MSB due to the larger dimensions of their switches. The mid-code in the transfer function experiences relatively larger glitch energy because all bits change their states and MSB is also {{involved in the process}} of determining the new value of the output signal.|$|R
50|$|When a more {{constant}} {{output voltage}} is desired, the Joule Thief {{can be given}} a closed-loop control. In the example circuit, the Schottky diode D1 blocks the charge built up on capacitor C1 from flowing back to the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor</b> Q1 when it is turned on. A 5.6 Volt Zener diode D2 and transistor Q2 forms the feedback control: when the voltage across the capacitor C1 {{is higher than the}} threshold voltage formed by Zener voltage of D2 plus the base-emitter turn-on voltage of transistor Q2, transistor Q2 is turned on diverting the base current of the <b>switching</b> <b>transistor</b> Q1, impeding the oscillation and prevents the voltage across capacitor C1 from rising even further. When the voltage across C1 drops below the threshold voltage Q2 turns off, allowing the oscillation to happen again. If the load requires even lower ripple, in this example some delicate digital circuitry like a microcontroller, a linear regulator can be used after this to smooth the ripple out.|$|R
