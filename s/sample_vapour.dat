40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Chemistry) [...] Tshwane University of Technology, 2008. This work {{is aimed at}} {{experimental}} verification of the theory about {{the advantages of the}} two-step <b>sample</b> <b>vapour</b> release in a fast-heated ballast furnace. The term “ballast” was introduced earlier in electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry, as an alternative to a platform to describe a compact body of refractive material loosely located on the bottom of a tube furnace atomiser. The thermal behaviour of the ballast furnace {{is similar to that of}} the platform, but without restriction created by the platform area. Compared with the flat or concave platform, a compact ballast of similar mass to the platform should have less impact on gas temperature because of the smaller surface area. The theoretical predictions concerning atomisation efficiency in the fast-heated ballast furnace were examined by the determination of metals in organic and inorganic matrices using a Quantum Z. ETA atomic absorption spectrometer. The instrument provided fast heating of the tube atomizer, 10 K ms- 1. It is shown that in the employed ballast furnace the vapour released into the gas phase occurs after interim condensation on the ballast. For the samples of tetraethyllead, base oil and aqueous solutions of various metals, analytical signals are observed after stabilisation of tube temperature, independent of volatility of the analyte and level of temperature setting. For those samples, a high gas phase temperature provides complete recovery of the analyte without involvement of chemical modifiers and the reduction of spectral interferences from chloride matrices...|$|E
40|$|The focused {{electron}} beam induced deposition {{process is a}} promising technique for nano and micro patterning. Electrons can be focused in sub-angström dimensions, which allows atomic-scale resolution imaging, analysis, and processing techniques. Before the process {{can be used in}} controlled applications, the precise nature of the deposition mechanism must be described and modelled. The aim of this research work is to present a physical and chemical description of the focused {{electron beam}} induced deposition process. As an introduction, a review of the literature, up to the present day, shows how this process was first identified as the origin of contamination in electron microscopes. Then the modifications made to a scanning electron microscope for deposition experiments are described. Gas supply systems and gas cryo-trapping devices were set up. Electrical and optical systems were constructed for an in-situ monitoring of the process. The experiment procedure was carried out in several phases, with the first being the deposition of flat films of carbon, copper-containing carbon composites, and pure gold {{for the study of the}} physics of the process. By measuring the fraction of the probe current that was absorbed in the sample, an accurate description could be made of the propagation of electrons. The backscattered electrons clearly influenced the deposition rate of Cu-containing films. A physical model for scanning deposition was created. The second phase is the deposition of metal-matrix composite tips from a stationary beam. Forward electron scattering was discovered to be responsible for tip formation and shape. A physical model of electron trajectories is included. The third phase is the construction of three-dimensional micro-structures by moving the beam during deposition. The deposited shapes result from an electron range that is larger than the structure size. Further investigation into the chemistry of the process involved the analysis of carbon films by micro-beam techniques. Regardless of the precursor used, the resulting films had a composition as C 9 H 2 ±xO 1 ±x (x< 1). The C phase hybridization was 90 % sp 2. The elements H, N, O, F, and Cl were volatilized from the precursor during precursor fixation. Further parameters of deposition rate, temperature of the <b>sample,</b> <b>vapour</b> pressure, and the dipole moment of the precursors were examined. Electrically conductive metal-containing focused electron beam induced deposits were used for constructing micro-devices, a nanotube-based contact and a magnetic field sensor with 500 × 500 nm 2 active area...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} heat {{transfer}} and moisture movement in liquid and vapour phase has {{attracted the attention}} of scientists from the beginning of 19 th century. The study is very important to many geotechnical and geoenvironmental problems like diurnal heat mass movement in ground, performance assessment of nuclear waste disposal repositories, buried hot pipes, buried high voltage electric cables and landfill liners. Significant experimental and theoretical development has been made in this field but still {{there is a lack of}} experimental data available specially for highly swelling clays. The heat transfer and liquid moisture movement theories for clays more or less are very well established but vapour transfer theory is still based upon rigid matrix granular soils. Therefore, this thesis presents an experimental, theoretical and numerical investigation of the heat and moisture movement in unsaturated clays. A new apparatus termed a thermo-hydraulic (TH) cell has been designed, fabricated and calibrated in-house to perform thermal gradient, thermo-hydraulic gradient and isothermo-hydraulic gradient tests on two types of clays namely Speswhite kaolin and MX- 80 bentonite. The TH cell is capable of measuring the transient temperature, relative humidity, volume flow rate of incoming water and swelling pressure. It also facilitates the determination of moisture content, dry density and chemical composition (anions and cations concentration) of the soil samples at the end of the tests. In the thermal test, the clay sample is subjected to fixed temperatures of 85 C at the bottom end and 25 C at the top end. In the thermo-hydraulic test, same thermal gradient is used like the thermal test and in addition to this deionised and de-aired water was supplied at the top end under a pressure of 0. 6 MPa. In the isothermal test, the clay sample is supplied deionised and de-aired water from the top end under a pressure of 0. 6 MPa and the temperature kept at 25 C at both ends of the clay sample. The test results show that there is a cycle of vapour and liquid moisture movement within the clay <b>sample,</b> <b>vapour</b> moves from the hot end to the cold and condense to liquid at the cold end and liquid moisture moves to the hot end. The accumulation of chloride ions near the hot end indicate that liquid moisture moved from the cold end to the hot end. An empirical method has been developed to calculate the vapour fluxes using the variation of chloride ions concentration with time. The vapour fluxes calculated empirically found to be much lower than that determined by existing vapour theories. Therefore, the existing vapour theory has been modified to more closely predict the observed vapour fluxes. The new modified vapour transfer theory has been incorporated in transient finite element code and validated against the experimental work carried out in this study. The numerically simulated results match reasonably with the experimental heat and mass results. Further research is necessary to explore the new vapour theory application to large scale tests...|$|E

40|$|A room-temperature {{ionic liquid}} (RTIL), 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, was {{investigated}} as a selective deposition for quartz crystal microbalances. RTILs constitute versatile matrices of tuneable physicochemical properties providing a high solute mobility compared to polymer matrices, and hence in principle short response and desorption times. This paper explores {{the feasibility of}} using RTIL-based quartz crystal microbalances as vapour sensors with particular focus on the physicochemical interactions between the RTIL and a model solute, ethyl acetate. Preliminary experiments were conducted and proved an excellent baseline recovery of the sensor. The transient sensor response was modelled using a basic mass transport equation which proved {{the simplicity of the}} system when compared to polymer coatings. The diffusion coefficient of ethyl acetate was calculated to be 10. 8 · 10 - 11 m 2 ·s- 1, which was one order of magnitude higher than in a common polymeric deposition material, polydimethylsiloxane. However, it is pointed out that care must be taken when interpreting the sensor signal upon dissolution of a complex vapour; absorption of solutes into the RTIL can give rise to viscosity changes which affect the sensor signal and hence overlap with the response to the solute mass absorbed. Nevertheless, for simple <b>sample</b> <b>vapours</b> we believe that quartz resonators can also be a complementary and cheap method for investigating basic mass transport phenomena...|$|R

Eighteen professional hairdressers (3 /day) coloured hairdresser's training heads bearing natural human hair (hair length: approximately 30 cm) for 6 h/working day with a dark-shade oxidative hair dye containing 2 % [14 C]-para-phenylenediamine (PPD). Three separate phases of hair dyeing were monitored: (A) dye preparation/hair dyeing, (B) rinsing/shampooing/conditioning and (C) cutting/drying/styling. Ambient air and personal monitoring <b>samples</b> (<b>vapours</b> and particles), nasal and hand rinses were collected during all study phases. Urine (pre-exposure, quantitative samples for the 0 - 12, 12 - 24, 24 - 48 h periods after start of exposure) and blood samples (blank, 4, 8 or 24 h) were collected from all exposed subjects. Radioactivity was determined in all biological samples and study materials, tools and washing liquids, and a [14 C]-mass balance was performed daily. No adverse events were noted during the study. Waste, equipment, gloves and coveralls contained 0. 41 ± 0. 16 %, dye mixing bowls 2. 88 ± 0. 54 %, hair wash 45. 47 ± 2. 95 %, hair + scalp 53. 46 ± 4. 06 % of the applied radioactivity, respectively. Plasma levels were below the limit of quantification (≤ 10 ng PPDeq/mL). Total urinary 0 - 48 h excretion of [14 C] levels ranged from a total of < 2 - 18 μg PPDeq and was similar in subjects exposed during the different phases of hair dyeing. Minimal air levels at or slightly above the limit of quantification were found in a few personal air monitoring samples during the phases of hair dyeing and hair cutting, but not during the rinsing phase. Air area monitoring samples or nasal rinses contained no measurable radioactivity. Hand residues ranged from 0. 006 to 0. 15 μg PPDeq/cm 2, and were found predominantly after the cutting/drying phase. The mean mass balance of [14 C] across the six study days was 102. 50 ± 2. 20 %. Overall, the mean, total systemic exposure of hairdressers to oxidative hair dyes during a working day including 6 hair dyeing processes {{was estimated to be}} < 0. 36 μg PPDeq/kg body weight/working day.

40|$|Large {{volumes of}} {{potentially}} tritium-contaminated waste materials are generated during nuclear decommissioning that require accurate characterisation prior to final waste sentencing. The practice of initially determining a radionuclide waste fingerprint for materials from an operational area {{is often used}} to save time and money but tritium cannot be included because of its tendency to be chemically mobile. This mobility demands a specific measurement for tritium and also poses a challenge in terms of sampling, storage and reliable analysis. This study shows that the extent of any tritium redistribution during storage will depend on its form or speciation and the physical conditions of storage. Any weakly or moderately bound tritium (e. g. adsorbed water, waters of hydration or crystallisation) may be variably lost at temperatures over the range 100 – 300 °C whereas for more strongly bound tritium (e. g. chemically bound or held in mineral lattices) the liberation temperature can be delayed up to 800 °C. For tritium that is weakly held the emanation behaviour at different temperatures becomes particularly important. The degree of 3 H loss and cross-contamination that can arise after sampling and before analysis can be reduced by appropriate storage. Storing <b>samples</b> in <b>vapour</b> tight containers at the point of sampling, the use of triple enclosures, segregating high activity samples and using a freezer all lead to good analytical practice...|$|R

The ternary {{systems of}} water with 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol and 1 -butanol or ethanol, {{important}} in industrial applications, have been chosen for investigating the vapour ^ liquid equilibria (VLE) of systems with highly associating components and liquid ^ liquid separation (VLLE). A static equilibrium apparatus with two vibrating tube densimeters (made of glass) for measuring the densities of vapour and liquid developed by Rott (1990, PhD thesis, Universita « t-GH-Paderborn) has been modified and tested up to 30 bar and 200 8 C (for densities only up to 150 8 C). Vapour and liquid are circulated through the densimeters and the equilibrium cell by two micrometering pumps. All parts of the apparatus containing the test fluid are temperature-controlled at phase equilibrium temperature. <b>Samples</b> of <b>vapour</b> and liquid(s) are analysed by gas chromatography (GC-MSD).

The deviations between the measurements and calculations for the saturation pressure and the densities and compositions of vapour and liquid at equilibrium do not exceed a few percent.

The fractionation factor exhibits a cross-over at temperatures around − 50 °C with the water vapour fraction being D-depleted relative to the residual ice fraction at T < − 50 °C (αice-vapour = 0. 969 – 0. 995). This cross-over has implications for the understanding of the atmospheric water cycle of some terrestrial planets such as the Earth or Mars. The magnitude of deuterium enrichment or depletion be- tween ice and water vapour cannot explain the differences in the D/H ratios amongst Jupiter comets and long–period comets families nor those that have been documented between Earth’s and cometary wate...|$|R
40|$|Droplet {{evaporation}} in turbulent sprays involves unsteady, multiscale and multiphase processes {{which make}} its comprehension and model capabilities still limited. The present work aims to investigate droplet vaporization dynamics within a turbulent spatial developing jet in dilute, non-reacting conditions. We {{address the problem}} using a Direct Numerical Simulation of jet laden with acetone droplets using an hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian approach based on the point droplet approximation. A detailed statistical analysis of both phases is presented. In particular, we show how crucial is the preferential <b>sampling</b> of the <b>vapour</b> phase induced by the inhomogeneous localization of the droplets through the flow. The preferential segregation of droplets develops suddenly downstream the inlet both within the turbulent core and in the mixing layer. Two distinct mechanisms {{have been found to}} drive these phenomena, the inertial small-scale clustering in the jet core and the intermittent dynamics of droplets across the turbulent/non-turbulent interface in the mixing layer where dry air entrainment occurs. These phenomenologies strongly affect the overall vaporization process and lead to a spectacular widening of droplets size and vaporization rate distributions in the downstream evolution of the turbulent spray...|$|R
40|$|A novel laser {{sampling}} technique, back-surface ablation, {{has been}} developed for ICP-AES. Samples are coated onto a transparent substrate and a laser beam is irradiated onto the sample through the substrate instead of sampling directly from the sample surface. As part of the sample is vaporized by the laser beam, a high pressure develops at the sample-substrate interface. The sample at the laser spot is explosively and completely removed by the expanding <b>vapour.</b> <b>Sampling</b> efficiency is up to ten times higher than conventional 'front-surface' laser sampling. Also, preferential vaporization is minimized because of complete removal of the sample at the laser spot. The risk of inaccurate chemical analysis associated with non-stoichiometric thermal vaporization in front surface laser sampling is reduced. Two methods of calibration, viz., standard additions and calibration with standards in a poly (vinyl alcohol) matrix, were used for quantitative elemental analysis of household paints using front- and back-surface ablation-ICP-AES. Internal standards were used to compensate for pulse-to-pulse laser energy fluctuation and sample thickness variation across a sample. Ten elements with different thermal properties and at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 ppm were determined and the elemental concentrations were {{compared with those of}} microwave digestion/solution nebulization ICP-AES. Back-surface ablation appears to be more accurate than conventional front-surface ablation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen {{reduction}} reaction plays a {{major role}} in fuel cell applications to generate electricity by an electrochemical reaction. In this study, functionalised graphene composited with Fe-NCNT or NCNT were investigated on its ORR activity using a physical mixing method. Initially, functionalised graphene was produced via oxidation of graphene. NCNT and Fe-NCNT was obtained from the previously prepared <b>samples</b> using chemical <b>vapour</b> deposition technique and electrochemical reduction method for Fe-NCNT. The physical mixing between functionalised graphene and NCNT or Fe-NCNT was performed using sonication with the presence of pyrrole to produce the desired nanocatalyst. The surface morphologies and microstructures of the synthesised nanocatalysts were studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy. Surface chemical functionality of the nanocatalysts was investigated using X-ray photoelectron microscopy. Meanwhile, the ORR performance of nanocatalysts in a half cell were investigated using cyclic voltammetry techniques in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. From this study, agglomeration of functionalised graphene (f-graphene) was observed on the Fe-NCNTs indicating a hindrance in transfer of electrons within the catalyst surface. NCNT/f-graphene showed to contain higher percentage of pyridinic-N which claimed to have favored the catalytic activity compared to Fe-NCNT/f-graphene. Likewise, a higher onset potential was recorded for NCNT/f-graphene which indicated a higher ORR activity than the Fe-NCNT/f-graphene...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the use of multiply charged atomic ions for the measurement of isotopic ratios of gaseous and <b>vapour</b> <b>samples.</b> We use a mass spectrometer system incorporating an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source for this purpose. In the cases of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, {{the selection of the}} 2 + atomic species is found to be the most effective for obtaining reliable isotopic ratios. Using samples of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, air and water vapour, we have demonstrated the determination of the isotopic ratios C- 13 /C- 12, N- 15 /N- 14, O- 17 /O- 16 and O- 18 /O- 16. For oxygen, this technique offers an alternative to the equilibration or purification methods normally required to obtain isotopic ratios of water or other oxygen-containing samples. In particular, O- 17 /O- 16 can be measured directly without isobaric interference from OH+. With typical ionization efficiencies of greater than 10 %, ECR ion sources have the potential to enable measurements on very small samples. In addition to those evaluated in the present work, there is scope for application of this method to other sample types, to a variety of sampling methods, and to other elements. © 2008, Wiley-Blackwell.
