5|$|A natural form {{of large}} scale {{environmental}} shading/dimming {{has been identified}} that affected the 2006 northern hemisphere hurricane season. The NASA study found that several major dust <b>storms</b> <b>in</b> June and July in the Sahara desert sent dust drifting over the Atlantic Ocean and through several effects caused cooling of the waters, thus dampening the development of hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{meteorological}} surveys alert about hurricanes {{or severe}} <b>storms,</b> <b>in</b> {{the areas where}} the risk of coastal flooding is particularly high, there are specific storm surge warnings.

Unusually, none of the <b>storms</b> <b>in</b> the Arabian Sea made landfall this year. The most significant storm of the season was the Bhola cyclone, which formed in the Bay of Bengal and hit Bangladesh on November 12. The storm killed at least 500,000, making it the deadliest tropical cyclone in recorded history.|$|E

Hugo ranked as the costliest Atlantic hurricane until Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and has since fallen further due to destructive <b>storms</b> <b>in</b> the 2000s and 2010s. Few other <b>storms</b> <b>in</b> 1989 caused significant damage; hurricanes Chantal and Jerry both resulted in flooding and wind impacts in Texas. Hurricane Dean also caused light damage in Bermuda and the Canadian province of Newfoundland. Tropical Storm Karen, the final storm of the season, brought heavy rainfall and a tornado to Cuba, before dissipating on December4. Overall, the storms of the season collectively caused 124fatalities and at least $10.54billion in damage.|$|E

5|$|The season {{produced}} the highest Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) on {{record with a}} total of 259. The measurement is a method to compare tropical cyclone activity between seasons. Originally, 1933 had an ACE of 213, which was surpassed by 1950 and 2005.
