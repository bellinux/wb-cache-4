500|$|Some {{linguists}} {{and philosophers}} of language have criticized Fodor's self-proclaimed [...] "extreme" [...] concept nativism. Kent Bach, for example, takes Fodor {{to task for}} his criticisms of lexical semantics and polysemy. Fodor claims {{that there is no}} lexical structure to such verbs as [...] "keep", [...] "get", [...] "make" [...] and [...] "put". He suggests that, alternatively, [...] "keep" [...] simply expresses the concept KEEP (Fodor capitalizes concepts to distinguish them from properties, names or other such entities). If there is a straightforward one-to-one mapping between individual words and concepts, [...] "keep your clothes on", [...] "keep your receipt" [...] and [...] "keep washing your hands" [...] will all share the same concept of KEEP under Fodor's theory. This concept presumably locks on to the unique external property of keeping. But, if this is true, then RETAIN must pick out a different property in RETAIN YOUR RECEIPT, since one can't retain one's clothes on or retain washing one's hands. Fodor's theory also has a problem explaining how the concept FAST contributes, differently, to the contents of FAST CAR, FAST DRIVER, FAST TRACK, and FAST TIME. Whether or not the differing interpretations of [...] "fast" [...] in these sentences are specified in the semantics of English, or are the result of pragmatic inference, is a matter of debate. Fodor's own response to this kind of criticism is expressed bluntly in Concepts: [...] "People sometimes used to say that exist must be ambiguous because look at the difference between 'chairs exist' and 'numbers exist'. A familiar reply goes: the difference between the existence of chairs and the existence of numbers seems, on reflection, strikingly like the difference between numbers and chairs. <b>Since</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the latter to explain the former, you don't also need 'exist' to be polysemic." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{historian}} Carlo Ginzburg related, Montefalco {{had begun}} to warp Gasparotto's testimony of the benandanti journey to fit the established clerical image of the diabolical witches' sabbat, while under the stress of interrogation and imprisonment, Gasparotto himself was losing his self-assurance and beginning to question [...] "the reality of his beliefs". Several days later, Gasparotto openly told Montefalco that he believed that [...] "the apparition of that angel was really the devil tempting me, <b>since</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> told me he can transform himself into an angel". When Moduco was also summoned to Montefalco, on 2 October 1580, {{he went on to}} announce the same thing, proclaiming that the Devil must have deceived him into going on the nocturnal journey which he believed was performed for good. Having both confessed to Montefalco that their nocturnal journeying had been caused by the Devil, both Gasparotto and Moduco were released, pending sentencing for their crime at a later date. Due to a jurisdictional conflict between the Cividale commissioner and the patriarch's vicar, the pronouncement of Gasparotto and Moduco's punishment was postponed until 26 November 1581. Both denounced as heretics, they were spared from excommunication but condemned to six months' imprisonment, and furthermore ordered to offer prayers and penances to God on certain days of the year, including the Ember Days, in order that he might forgive their sins. However, their penalties were soon remitted, on the condition that they remain within the city of Cividale for a fortnight.|$|E
