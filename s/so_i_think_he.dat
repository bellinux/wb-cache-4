500|$|In 1987, the Pixies {{released}} an 18-track demo tape, {{commonly referred to}} as The Purple Tape. Thompson's father assisted the band financially, loaning $1,000 in order to record the demo tape; Thompson later said that his father [...] "wasn't around for a lot of my younger years, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was doing his best {{to make up for lost}} time." [...] The Purple Tape led to a recording contract with the English independent record label 4AD. For the release of the mini album Come On Pilgrim, Thompson adopted the alias [...] "Black Francis", a name inspired by his father: [...] "he had been saving that name in case he had another son." ...|$|E
500|$|More {{than one}} hundred actors auditioned for the role, but only ten were taken seriously by the producers. Known actors such as Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees for the role as Agent Doggett. Both Phillips and Bochner were {{considered}} for the role, but the producers eventually chose Robert Patrick. In an interview with, Chris Carter said [...] "I think {{it was something that}} we all talked about, but I wrote his voice. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was someone we all came up with together, but his voice came out of my head. But, it was something that was helped in a large degree by casting Robert Patrick." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Hillenburg {{enrolled}} in the Experimental Animation Program at CalArts: [...] "Changing careers like that is scary, but {{the irony is that}} animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education is more of a struggle," [...] he admitted. He studied under Jules Engel, the founding director of the program, whom he considers his [...] "Art Dad" [...] and mentor. Engel accepted him into the program impressed by The Intertidal Zone. Hillenburg posited further, [...] " [...] also was a painter, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> saw my paintings and could easily say, 'Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.' I don't have any [...] animation really." [...] He graduated in 1992, earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mmmyes, <b>I</b> believe <b>so....</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> {{what you}} call a black sheep. We haven't many of them, thank God! but we have a few.... He's an unfortunate man of some kind...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He studied {{very hard}} last winter," [...] said Anne. [...] "You know he took High Honors in Classics and the Cooper Prize. It hasn't been taken for five years! <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> rather run down. We're {{all a little}} tired." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is but {{wood dust}} which I {{use for the}} {{cleaning}} of my nails," [...] cried Masapo, for <b>he</b> was <b>so</b> terrified <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> knew not what he said.|$|R
500|$|After Milk's {{vote for}} the mental health {{facility}} in White's district, however, White refused to speak with Milk and communicated with only one of Milk's aides. Other acquaintances remembered White as very intense. [...] "He was impulsive... He was an extremely competitive man, obsessively <b>so...</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> could not take defeat," [...] San Francisco's assistant fire chief told reporters. White's first campaign manager quit {{in the middle of}} the campaign, and told a reporter that White was an egotist and it was clear that he was antigay, though he denied it in the press. White's associates and supporters described him [...] "as a man with a pugilistic temper and an impressive capacity for nurturing a grudge". The aide who had handled communications between White and Milk remembered, [...] "Talking to him, I realized that he saw Harvey Milk and George Moscone as representing all that was wrong with the world".|$|E
500|$|He {{signed a}} new one-year deal with Vale in July 2011, after Micky Adams {{returned}} to the club as manager. After scoring five goals in his first nine games he admitted that [...] "He [...] is the only manager that can control me <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> gets {{the best out of}} me." [...] However, on 19 September he was given a fourteen-day suspension by the club for 'a serious breach of club discipline', after he missed a day of training without any warning and then 'reported in unfit to carry out his duties' the following day; Adams said [...] "I'm bitterly disappointed in him." [...] He was also placed on the transfer list, as Adams stated [...] "he's got a lot to do" [...] before Roberts could think about a return to the first team. He made his return on 24 October, when Adams named him on the bench for a league clash with Bristol Rovers.|$|E
500|$|Tim Ashley {{wrote in}} The Guardian in 2009 that Khachaturian's {{popularity}} {{fell in the}} West, because of his image as one of Soviet music's [...] "". He argued, [...] "Such a view is simplistic, given {{that he had a}} major brush with the authorities in 1948. But it's also easy to see how he acquired his awkward reputation when you hear his Violin Concerto, dating from 1940. It's an immensely attractive work, full of his trademark Armenian folk flourishes, and the swaying, hypnotic Andante is notably beautiful. But the unforced optimism of the outer movements now seems unthinking when we realise it was composed at a time when Stalin was giving Prokofiev and Shostakovich hell." [...] In 2003 conductor Marin Alsop opined that Khachaturian is [...] "very underperformed" [...] and [...] "somewhat underrated". She commented further: [...] "His music, of course, has {{a little bit of the}} edginess of the 20th-century sound, the dissonances coming in. But at the same time it marries this beautiful neo-romanticism and lush orchestration and the over-the-top approach, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> can be quite relevant these days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't see {{anything}} amiss in his doing <b>so,</b> papa. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> wishes to be friendly. The property {{will be his}} some day, and I don't see why {{that should not be}} mentioned, when there is occasion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Rollo, {{turning back}} to his father, again, [...] "he lent it to me for the whole walk, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had any right {{to take it back}} again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is he all as {{he should}} be?' asked Miss Cathy, seriously; 'or is he simple: not right? I've {{questioned}} him twice now, and each time <b>he</b> looked <b>so</b> stupid <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> does not understand me. I can hardly understand him, I'm sure!' ...|$|R
500|$|Anderson {{quickly became}} {{a key part of}} the Minutemen as a freshman, {{starting}} in 26 of the team's 29 games. He had personal ties with teammate Shannon Crooks, who was brought up in the same area of Massachusetts. According to head coach Steve Lappas, Crooks helped Anderson adjust to the college level. Lappas said, [...] "I think he helped Anthony a lot. They're both from Boston so they have a little kinship there and they're pretty close <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> definitely helped him." [...] On November 16, 2011, Anderson took part in his first official collegiate game against Arkansas–Little Rock, scoring 10 points, grabbing 5 rebounds, and recording 4 assists. He played a team-high 37 minutes as the Minutemen won the game, 66–60. In the days that followed, the point guard would earn Atlantic 10 Conference Rookie of the Week honors. On December 4, 2011, Anderson posted career-highs of 13 points and 7 assists vs. Holy Cross. He eclipsed the scoring total in his following game against Boston College, in which he recorded a team-high 19 points. In this game, Anderson hit three three-pointers in the closing 15.2 seconds, but he could not lead his team to the victory. On January 29, 2002, in a loss to Dayton, Anderson scored a season-high 20 points and made 6 of 7 three-pointers. He became the first Minuteman to record over 5 threes that season and scored double figures for the 10th time as a freshman. In mid-February 2002, Anderson was named co-WHMP/UMass Athlete of the Week after scoring 14 and 11 points against Duquesne and La Salle respectively. By the end of the season, he was averaging 10.0 points, 3.4 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 1.1 steals. Anderson finished his freshman year by being named Atlantic 10 Rookie of the Week four times—a league-high—and ultimately earned conference All-Rookie and Rookie of the Year honors. He became the fourth Minuteman of all-time to be Freshman, Rookie, or Newcomer of the Year and the first since Marcus Camby in 1994. At the team banquet, Anderson won the Mark Donoghue Most Productive Player Award for [...] "having numbers in every category." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{unidentified}} {{source said}} interrogations with Roof {{after his arrest}} determined he had been planning the attack for around six months, researched Emanuel AME Church, and targeted it because of its role in African-American history. One of the friends who briefly hid Roof's gun from him said, [...] "I don't think the church was his primary target because {{he told us he}} was going for the school. But I think he couldn't get into the school because of the security ... <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> just settled for the church." ...|$|E
2500|$|Danny Glover as Man with Black Eye Patch. Glover {{described}} his character: [...] "The Man with the Black Eye Patch comes {{into this new}} world of blindness already half blind, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> understands where he is within his own truth, within himself. I did feel like this character was very much like Saramago because he is completely unapologetic—he is {{who he is and}} he accepts who he is." [...] Glover explained his involvement with the role, [...] "When you are blind you try to adopt another kind of sensitivity, so this role is definitely a challenge from a physical point of view." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'His name is Springrove,' said Owen, {{in reply}} to her. 'He is a {{thorough}} artist, {{but a man}} of rather humble origin, it seems, who has made himself <b>so</b> far. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{is the son of}} a farmer, or something of the kind.' ...|$|R
60|$|Cecily. Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious! Sometimes he is <b>so</b> serious that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{cannot be}} quite well.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{may well}} do <b>so,</b> for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has no notion of {{throwing}} off his allegiance to you--his {{first and only}} love. He liked very well to make fun with Eva; but he regarded her rather as a siren, who drew him off from his Latin and Greek.' ...|$|R
2500|$|For Series 10, Capaldi {{described}} his character as more 'closed off' and 'suspicious' {{than the previous}} season, he elaborated 'If you’ve been following this Doctor, you’ve seen him go through all those different colours and all those different places, and as for where he goes now, I don’t know, but he’s been put through the mill.” Capaldi {{expressed in terms of}} his character 'Because in some ways he’s much more amenable, but in other ways he’s even darker. So I think that makes for a very interesting character.' Upon discussing the interaction between The Doctor and his latest companion Bill Potts, Capaldi elaborated “It’s a kind of teacher-pupil relationship, but it becomes more complex than that and I think ultimately the Doctor has to undergo some dramas by himself. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> becomes slightly worried that he’s swept someone else up into his adventures without quite preparing them.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{got myself}} {{unwrapped}} {{as soon as}} I could," [...] continued the King, [...] "and then I hunted for the doctor, who hid himself until my anger had subsided. He has never sent in a bill, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> must be terribly ashamed of himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy grinned. [...] "I think he's crazy, {{if you ask}} me," [...] said he. [...] "And yet he {{was just}} as earnest about {{it as if it were}} really <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> must have eaten {{something}} that has gone to his head. There's Unc' Billy Possum over there. Let's ask him what he thinks." ...|$|E
60|$|AFTER losing them, he ran on {{four legs}} and went faster, <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> might have got away {{altogether}} {{if he had}} not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Constance. 'Oh, aunt, <b>I</b> am <b>so</b> sorry! <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{would have}} done it if the other boys had not teased him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And besides that, John,--which {{would be}} quite as serious {{in the eyes of}} a fellow of this sort,--he would have the laugh against him among all his companions for having been outwitted in the City. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> when <b>he</b> finds the game is up he will be glad enough to make off without causing trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{the next}} day she had gone again, however, and had seen him, and had visited him on every day since. Nothing further had been said about the child, and he had now become almost too weak for violent anger. [...] "I told him you were coming, and though he would not say <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is glad of it. He expects you to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{irritation}} quickly disappeared. I had now {{entered into}} my Cathay, and I must take things as I found them there. As I could not stay where I was, {{and could not}} continue my journey, {{it would be a}} sensible thing to overlook the man's manner and accept his offer, and I accordingly did <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was pleased more than he cared to express.|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] she answered, {{in a low}} voice, [...] "after you {{had gone}} to warn the army of Pharaoh because of that dream I dreamed, Ki, who {{departed}} on the same day, returned again.

There he made me this offer: ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the fifth}} season, Lincoln {{asserted}} that [...] "Rick is ... {{at the most}} complete place he’s been ever since the apocalypse started. He’s a man who doesn’t doubt himself anymore, and he’s accepted his brutality {{as much as his}} humanity. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he’s</b> in an incredibly powerful and dangerous place." [...] He also described him as being a leader once again, who is much more uncompromising as he [...] "drags a lot of group into a place that is darker, more brutal." [...] Entertainment Weekly assessed that [...] "This is the Rick viewers most assuredly need after watching him mope around on-and-off for two seasons after having very bad thing in the world happen to him. And it’s the Rick {{that the rest of the}} survivors need as well if they are going to continue to keep on keeping on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was talking}} very loudly, and I thought some of Lord Arthur's friends {{up in the}} {{pavilion}} must have heard. <b>He</b> thought <b>so,</b> too, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> for <b>he</b> said quickly: ...|$|R
6000|$|A year or {{two later}} [...] "Jim Wolf and the Cats" [...] {{appeared}} in a Tennessee paper in a new dress--as to spelling; spelling borrowed from Artemus Ward. The appropriator of the tale had a wide reputation in the West, and was exceedingly popular. Deservedly <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> wrote some of the breeziest and funniest things I have ever read, and did his work with distinguished ease and fluency. His name has passed out of my memory.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, never. What Sir Henry's views may be, I don't {{pretend to}} know. People here do {{say that he}} has been ingratiating himself with my brother for some time past. He has my leave, Miss Gauntlet. I am an old man, old enough to be your father"--the well-preserved old beau might have said grandfather--"and my {{experience}} of life is this, that money is never worth the trouble that men take to get it. They say my brother is fond of it; if <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has made a mistake in life--a great mistake." ...|$|E
6000|$|It is a {{very long}} time since I began to think about the {{relations}} between modern scientifically ascertained truths and the cosmogonical speculations of the writer of Genesis; and, as I think that Mr. Gladstone {{might have been able to}} put his case with a good deal more force if he had thought it worth while to consult the last chapter of Professor Dana's admirable Manual of Geology, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> might have been made aware that he was undertaking an enterprise of which he had not counted the cost, if he had chanced upon a discussion of the subject which I published in 1877.[22] ...|$|E
6000|$|The poor {{schoolmaster}} {{appeared to}} be gratified by her earnest manner, but yet rendered more uneasy by it, for he added hastily that anxious people often magnified an evil and thought it greater than it was; 'for my part,' he said, in his quiet, patient way, 'I hope it's not <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> can be worse.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he cannot help himself. To you he {{does not}} do even as much as that, because he can help himself. I have chosen to leave it {{to him and he}} has done nothing.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} by [...] "The Atlantic" [...] in August 2006, Preston called Mignini [...] "A sincere man and an honest and incorruptible judge", and said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> really believed that I was guilty and that Spezi was guilty.
