Characteristic frequency of nonlinear spectrum and spectrum power were determined {{under conditions of}} arc sliding discharge in supersonic flow. Two stages of discharge were defined: <b>sliding</b> <b>stage</b> and still stage. It was found that stage transition occurs due to convective instability of discharge.

40|$|Abstract. For {{the purpose}} of micro stage used in micro positioning, a {{miniature}} aerostatic air bearing linear slide system was studied. Different arrayed micro-hole plates were fabricated. Using focused laser drilling, {{the diameter of the}} hole is limited to 300 µm. However, with the MEMS process, smaller diameters up to 30 µm could be achieved. A miniature air bearing linear slide was constructed by imbedding three developed air pads in the slider block, which could slide along a small granite straightedge to form a small <b>sliding</b> <b>stage.</b> The pressure distribution of air pad simulated by the Spectral Element Method was found in good agreement with experimental results.

40|$|AbstractThe seismic {{stability}} of a cracked dam was {{examined in this}} study. Geometric nonlinearity and large deformations, {{as well as the}} contact condition at the crack site, were taken into consideration. The location of penetrated cracks was first identified using the concrete plastic-damage model based on the nonlinear finite element method (FEM). Then, the hard contact algorithm was used to simulate the crack interaction in the normal direction, and the Coloumb friction model was used to simulate the crack interaction in the tangential direction. After verification of numerical models through a case study, the seismic {{stability of}} the Koyna Dam with two types of penetrated cracks is discussed in detail with different seismic peak accelerations, and the collapse processes of the cracked dam are also presented. The results show that the stability of the dam with two types of penetrated cracks can be ensured in an earthquake with a magnitude of the original Koyna earthquake, and the cracked dam has a large earthquake-resistant margin. The failure processes of the cracked dam in strong earthquakes can be divided into two stages: the <b>sliding</b> <b>stage</b> and the overturning stage. The <b>sliding</b> <b>stage</b> ends near the peak acceleration, and the top block slides a long distance along the crack before the collapse occurs. The maximum sliding displacement of the top block will decrease with an increasing friction coefficient at the crack site...|$|E

First, a mechanical connection was made between lamp and ophthalmoscopic lens. This illumination unit was mounted to the table column with a double articulated arm. The binocular microscope was supported on a small stand and could be moved freely across the tabletop. Later, a cross <b>slide</b> <b>stage</b> was used for this purpose. Vogt introduced Koehler illumination, and the reddish Nernst glower was replaced with the brighter and whiter incandescent lamp. Special mention should be paid to the experiments that followed Henker’s improvements in 1919. On his improvements the Nitra lamp was replaced with a carbon arc lamp with a liquid filter. At this time the great importance of color temperature and the luminance of the light source for slit lamp examinations were recognized and the basis created for examinations in red-free light.|$|R

Many of the samples {{initially}} taken in this collection (47 %) were incense-cedar due to their availability, their ability to hold a fire scar, and their slow decay. However, this species proved difficult to date accurately against the pine-derived chronologies, so a master tree ring chronology was developed using 18 incense-cedar cores taken from 9 live trees near the Beckworth Ranger Station. A <b>sliding</b> <b>stage</b> micrometer was used to record ring widths, and the program COFECHA was used to crossdate the cores.

In our previous work, the ultrasonically levitated linear slider for a self-running <b>sliding</b> <b>stage</b> was investigated. When the flexural vibration mode is excited along the slider, the slider {{on the flat}} substrate can be levitated due to the acoustic radiation force from the own vibrating plate. The slider can move {{the same direction as}} the acoustic streaming induced along the air gap. The proposed 2 D stage was fabricated from a rectangular aluminum plate and the four vibrating plates were integrated. The vibrating plates are cantilever-type and the PZT elements are attached on the fixed-end of the vibrating plates. The 2 D stage has four our previous linear sliders, two pairs both in x and y directions. To isolate the performances of each vibrating plate, the four vibrating plates with different lengths were designed. The 2 D stage could be levitated at the several frequencies from 60 to 70 kHz. By changing the driving frequency, the moving direction of the stage could be controlled. The maximum thrust of 5. 3 mN could be obtained at 71 kHz with 70 Vpp...|$|E
40|$|The atomic-scale {{processes}} {{taking place}} during the sliding of diamond and diamond-like carbon surfaces are investigated using classical molecular dynamics simulations. During the initial <b>sliding</b> <b>stage,</b> diamond surfaces undergo an amorphization process, while an sp 3 to sp 2 conversion takes place in tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) and amorphous hydrocarbon (a-C:H) surface layers. Upon separation of the sliding samples, the interface fails. A rather smooth failure occurs for a-C:H, where the hydrogen atoms present in the bulk passivate the chemically active carbon dangling bonds. Conversely, sp-hybridized carbon chains are observed to form on diamond and ta-C surfaces. These carbynoid structures are known to undergo a fast degradation process when in contact with oxygen. Using quantum-accurate density functional theory simulations, we present a possible mechanism for the oxygen-induced degradation of the carbon chains, leading to oxidative wear of the sp phase on diamo nd and ta-C surfaces upon exposure to air. Oxygen molecules chemisorb on C-C bonds of the chains, triggering the cleavage of the chains through concerted O-O and C-C bond-breaking reactions. A similar reaction caused by adsorption of water molecules on the carbon chains is ruled out on energetic grounds. Further O 2 adsorption causes the progressive shortening of the resulting, O-terminated, chain fragments through the same O-O and C-C bond breaking mechanism accompanied by the formation of CO 2 molecules...|$|E
40|$|The framed {{structure}} infilled with a mortarless brick (MB) panel exhibits considerable in-plane energy dissipation {{because of the}} relative sliding between bricks and good out-of-plane stability resulting {{from the use of}} interlocking mechanisms. The cyclic behaviors of MB are investigated experimentally in this study. Two different types of bricks, namely non-interlocking mortarless brick (N-IMB) and interlocking mortarless brick (IMB), are examined experimentally. The cyclic behavior of all of the joints (N-IMB and IMB) are investigated in consideration of the effects of interlocking shapes, loading compression stress levels and loading cycles. The hysteretic loops of N-IMB and IMB joints are obtained, according to which a mechanical model is developed. The Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion is employed to describe the shear failure modes of all of the investigated joints. A typical frictional behavior is observed for the N-IMB joints, and a significant stiffening effect is observed for the IMB joints during their <b>sliding</b> <b>stage.</b> The friction coefficients of all of the researched joints increase with the augmentation of the compression stress level and improvement of the smoothness of the interlocking surfaces. An increase in the loading cycle results in a decrease in the friction coefficients of all of the joints. The degradation rate (DR) of the friction coefficients increases with the reduction in the smoothness of the interlocking surface...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{statistical}} methodology of estimating wear coefficient and predicting wear volume in a revolute joint using in-situ measurement data is presented. An instrumented slider-crank mechanism is built, which can measure the joint {{force and the}} relative motion between the pin and bushing during operation. The former is measured using a load cell built onto a necked portion of the hollow steel pin, while the latter is measured using a capacitance probe. In order to isolate the effect of friction in other joints, a porous carbon air bearing for the revolute joint between the follower link and the <b>slide</b> <b>stage,</b> {{as well as a}} prismatic joint for the linear slide, are used. Based on the relative motion between the centers of pin and bushing, the wear volumes are estimated at six different operating cycles. The Bayesian inference technique is used to update the distribution of wear coefficient, which incorporates in-situ measurement data to obtain the posterior distribution. In order to obtain the posterior distribution, Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique is employed, which effectively draws samples of the given distribution. The results show {{that it is possible to}} narrow the distribution of wear coefficient and to predict the future wear volume with reasonable confidences. The effect of prior distribution on the wear coefficient is discussed by comparing with non-informative case...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} internal tide generation at two-dimensional topography {{was carried out}} using the synthetic Schlieren experimental technique. Two linear models were tested: Balmforth, Ierley and Young's [1] subcritical solution for a Gaussian ridge and Hurley and Keady's [15] super-critical solution for a knife-edge. The former was modified {{to account for the}} effects of viscosity in the propagating wave beams. The experiment set up comprised a wave-tank with a linear salt-water stratification and a <b>sliding</b> <b>stage</b> on which the topography oscillated horizontally to simulate tidal flow. The wave field was measured by capturing the distortion of a pattern of random dots placed on a light sheet behind the tank using a CCD camera, and using the synthetic Schlieren processing of the movies obtained. Four experiments were performed, for wave beams propagating close to 25 ° and 56 from the horizontal for each topographic feature. The subcritical theory over-predicted the peak disturbance over the Gaussian ridge by a maximum of 50 %, and it correctly predicted the profile shape and evolution along the wave beam and throughout one period of the oscillation. (cont.) The supercritical knife-edge theory predicted the disturbance amplitude, shape and evolution within experimental error. The results showed that at Reynolds numbers below 0 (105), viscosity suppresses nonlinear effects and smoothes out instabilities predicted by inviscid models that would lead to overturning. These experiments have motivated the construction of a larger wave-tank to achieve higher Reynolds numbers. Future experiments will investigate nonlinear internal tide generation, overturning and mixing in unstable wave beams and flow separation over topography. by Paula Echeverri Mondragón. Thesis (S. M.)

Compared with the Ti-containing nano-composite DLC film, a graded Ti-C:H/TiCN/TiN film was also deposited by sputtering of titanium targets in reactive gases (nitrogen and C 2 H 2) using the same deposition system. The Ti/C multi-layered DLC coating deposited at a substrate rotation speed of 5 rev. /min depicted an amorphous structure with 2 -nm periodic thicknesses, and gave satisfactory friction performance in the pin-on-disk tests with a wear rate of 1 - 3 x 10 (- 17) m(3) /Nm and a friction coefficient of 0. 09 - 0. 1 against 100 Cr 6 steel and WC. The steady-state friction coefficient of nano-composite DLC films is {{lower than that of}} graded Ti-C:H DLC films (0. 15 - 0. 17). When sliding against soft copper ball, the friction coefficients of the DLC films were higher and increased with the sliding process from an initial friction coefficient of 0. 15 with a promising wear behavior. Wear debris were primarily composed of copper mixed with surface impurities. SEM, EDX and XPS analyses depicted that the initial Ti contained C-O transfer films possess good adhesion between the sliding counterparts (100 Cr 6 and WC) and the coatings during the initial <b>sliding</b> <b>stage.</b> Micro-Raman spectra acquired from the nano-composite DLC coatings demonstrated a tendency of graphite formation of the transfer film. The readily transferred oxide-free graphite-like sp(2) films form a lubricious layer, which possess low shear strengths under applied loads. The XPS analysis of DLC C 1 s core level also suggests that transfer film is sp(2) dominated. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{continuum}} {{damage mechanics}} (CDM), an isotropic and anisotropic damage model {{coupled with a}} novel plasticity model for plain concrete is proposed in this research. Two different damage evolution laws for both tension and compression are formulated for a more accurate prediction of the plain concrete behavior. In order to derive the constitutive equations, the strain equivalence hypothesis is adopted. The proposed constitutive model {{has been shown to}} satisfy the thermodynamics requirements, and detailed numerical algorithms are developed for the Finite Element implementation of the proposed model. Moreover, the numerical algorithm is coded using the user subroutine UMAT and then implemented in the commercial finite element analysis program Abaqus, and the overall performance of the proposed model is verified by comparing the model predictions to various experimental data on macroscopic level. Using the proposed coupled plasticity-damage constitutive model, the effect of the micromechanical properties of concrete, such as aggregate shape, distribution, and volume fraction, the ITZ thickness, and the strength of the ITZ and mortar matrix on the tensile behavior of concrete is investigated on 2 -D and 3 -D meso-scale. As a result of simulation, the tensile strength and thickness of the ITZ is the most important factor that control the global strength and behavior of concrete, and the aggregate shape and volume fraction has somewhat effect on the tensile behavior of concrete while the effect of the aggregate distribution is negligible. Furthermore, using the proposed constitutive model, the pull-out analysis of the single straight and curved CNT embedded in cement matrix is carried out. In consequence of the analysis, the interfacial fracture energy is the key parameter governing the CNT pull-out strength and ductility at bonding stage, and the Young's modulus of the CNT has also great effect on the pull-out behavior of the straight CNT. In case of the single curved CNT, while the ultimate pull-out force of the curved CNT at <b>sliding</b> <b>stage</b> is governed by the initial sliding force when preexisting normal force is relatively high, the ultimate pull-out force, when the preexisting normal force is not significant, is increased linearly proportional to the curvature and the Young's modulus of the CNT due to the additionally induced normal force by the bending stiffness of the curved CNT...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Alumina (Al 2 O 3) and Al 2 O 3 -based {{ceramics}} are candidate wear-resistant {{materials for}} many applications. In the past decades, the friction and wear behaviors of Al 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 -based ceramics in dry sliding and lubricated conditions have been extensively investigated. In dry sliding, surface modification of Al 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 -based ceramics at tribo-interface can be observed. In other words, the original surfaces of Al 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 -based ceramics {{can be modified}} by friction and friction-induced material interaction (fracture, mechanical mixing, tribo-sintering) at the tribo-interface, and hence {{give birth to a}} tribo-layer. The formation and evolution of the tribo-layer on the worn surfaces of Al 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 -based ceramics are the keys to understand the friction and wear behaviors of Al 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 -based ceramics.

40|$|Dexterous {{continuum}} manipulators (DCMs) can largely {{increase the}} reachable region and steerability for minimally and less invasive surgery. Many such procedures require the DCM {{to be capable}} of producing large deflections. The real-time control of the DCM shape requires sensors that accurately detect and report large deflections. We propose a novel, large deflection, shape sensor to track the shape of a 35 mm DCM designed for a less invasive treatment of osteolysis. Two shape sensors, each with three fiber Bragg grating sensing nodes is embedded within the DCM, and the sensors&# 39; distal ends fixed to the DCM. The DCM centerline is computed using the centerlines of each sensor curve. An experimental platform was built and different groups of experiments were carried out, including free bending and three cases of bending with obstacles. For each experiment, the DCM drive cable was pulled with a precise linear <b>slide</b> <b>stage,</b> the DCM centerline was calculated, and a 2 D camera image was captured for verification. The reconstructed shape created with the shape sensors is compared with the ground truth generated by executing a 2 D- 3 D registration between the camera image and 3 D DCM model.

40|$|We {{consider}} two random walkers in {{one dimension}} confined by two reflecting bound-aries M+ 1 sites apart. Since {{we want to}} model the process of mutation opening preceding the <b>sliding</b> <b>stage,</b> we seek the distribution of times until encounter of both walkers, given they started at opposite boundaries. Their motion {{is equivalent to the}} motion of one walker on a triangular piece of the two dimensional square lat-tice. The 2 D walker on site (m,n) corresponds the state, where the left 1 D walker is m steps from the left boundary and the right 1 D walker n steps from the right boundary (see Fig. 3, main text). The 2 D walker is reflected at the lines m = 0 and n = 0. The line, where both coordinates add up to M − 1 corresponds to the cases, when both walkers in 1 D meet and is therefore an absorbing boundary for the 2 D walker. The case, where the rates, at which the walker moves away and towards a boundary (kin and kout) are independent of the site, has been solved by Schwarz and Poland (1) using the methods of image charges. The quantity we are interested in is the distribution of {{the time of the first}} en-counter of the two random walkers in 1 D, or equivalently the lifetime distribution P (τ) of the random walker on the triangle. A walker sitting on any site (m,n) with m = M − 2 − n can hop on two absorbing sites with rate kin.

40|$|As {{a recent}} {{development}} to further reduce the flying {{height of a}} magnetic head in hard disk drives (HDDs) to nanometers, thermal flying-height (TFC) control technology is now widely applied in the HDD industry because it enables consistent read/write spacing, increased storage density and improved HDD reliability. The fast development of TFC technology presents new challenges to head designers because of the complicated structure of a TFC head, the thermo-mechanical-coupling effects and tribology issues arising at nanometer read/write spacing. A steady-state TFC solver dedicated to obtaining the steady-state flying attitude of a TFC slider is developed in this thesis. This solver uses a finite volume based solver (CML static solver) to solve the generalized Reynolds equation and obtain the pressure and spacing fields in the air bearing and a commercial coupled-field solver (ANSYS) to obtain the stress and strain fields due to internal heating. An iterative procedure is adopted to consider the cooling effect of the air bearing on the heater-induced protrusion. Accuracy of the solver is verified by drive-level magnetic tests on several combinations of air bearing and heater designs. TFC sliders' performances under different ambient conditions are investigated based on the TFC solver. It is found that the thermal actuation efficiency of a TFC slider increases with altitude because of the weakened cooling and reduced air bearing stiffness at the transducer area at a higher altitude. In addition, a TFC slider maintains a more consistent read/write spacing at different humidity levels, compared with a non-TFC slider, because the thermal actuation is able to compensate part of the pressure loss caused by water condensation. A TFC slider's flying height in air-helium mixtures is {{shown to be a}} highly nonlinear function of the fraction of helium in the gas mixture due to the combined effects of the gas mean free path, viscosity and heat conductivity. These results provide general guidelines for heater and ABS designers to reduce a TFC slider's sensitivity to ambient conditions and improve HDD reliability. A touchdown numerical model for predicting TFC sliders' dynamics at touchdown and over-pushed conditions is developed and implemented based on the CML dynamic simulator. It extends the solution of the time-varying generalized Reynolds equation to near-contact and contact conditions using a statistical multi-asperity approach. Various interfacial forces are considered by use and further development of a sub-boundary lubrication model to capture important tribological effects occurring at touchdown. This model is able to predict a TFC slider's unstable dynamics at the beginning of touchdown, which has been discovered in many related experimental studies. The effects of different head-disk interface factors are investigated using this numerical model. It is found that the suspension is actively involved in the TFC slider's bouncing vibrations and has a significant influence on the excited second air bearing pitch mode. It is also shown that adhesion force serves as an essential factor in exciting the second air bearing mode whereas other interfacial forces only affect details of the slider's bouncing behaviors. By changing the interfacial properties, namely, the interface roughness and lubricant thickness, the variation of interfacial forces with spacing reduction differs, which leads to very different touchdown patterns. With a rougher interface profile the slider smoothly transfers from a flying stage to a <b>sliding</b> <b>stage.</b> With a smoother interface profile the slider experiences a flying-bouncing-sliding transition. With the smoothest interface the slider goes through a flying-bouncing-surfing-sliding transition. The touchdown behaviors predicted by the numerical simulator are correlated with experiments conducted on industry-provided head parts with the same ABS and suspension design. Similar touchdown stages and excited modes are also discovered in the experiments. Though experiments showed a slider spectrum with richer frequency components, the modes missed from the numerical simulations are recovered by conducting a harmonic analysis on a full HGA model with air bearing included. The different touchdown dynamic patterns predicted here result in significant differences in the successful touchdown detection, which is very important for realizing reliable read/write operations, and therefore this work provides guidelines for head disk interface (HDI) optimization. The general approach proposed here is also applicable to studies on the effects of other important HDI factors, such as air bearing geometric features, heater-induced protrusion profiles, and suspension design parameters, and on the slider's touchdown dynamics behaviors, which will assist in obtaining solutions to performance and reliability issues in current hard disk drives...|$|E

40|$|An {{extensive}} experimental {{seismic testing}} programme, named project JETBIS (Joint Experimental Testing of Base Isolation Systems), {{has been developed}} within the RELUIS (2010 - 2013) project - Task 2. 3. 2, involving partners from different Italian universities. This paper describes the tests performed on seismic devices based on Double Concave Friction Pendulum (DCFP). In order to assess the fidelity of the considered non-linear model under uni-directional motion, controlled-displacement and seismic-input experiments were conducted using shaking table at University of Basilicata and at University of Naples “Federico II”, respectively. The DCFP isolator contains two separate concave sliding surfaces and exhibits different hysteretic properties {{at different stages of}} displacement. The numerical model of DCFP used is general so that no condition regarding bearing properties, which effect the sequence of <b>sliding</b> <b>stages,</b> are required for the validity of the model. The experimental model for seismic tests was a 1 / 3 scaled steel framed structure with one storey and one bay in both directions. Four DCFP bearings with equal properties of the concave sliding surfaces were mounted under each column. The main objective of this work is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} nonlinear modelling considering two different finite element programme SAP 2000 and CDS-Opensees to investigate on influence of the sliding velocity and of the vertical load on the behavior of DCFP devices under different condition of the sliding surfaces (with and without lubrication). A further goal was to verify the reliability of the numerical models also when large residual displacements due to previous earthquakes are present in the isolation system. In this paper the experimental outcomes of various testing model configurations are compared with the results of non linear dynamic analyses obtain by both numerical simulations...|$|R
