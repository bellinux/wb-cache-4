40|$|Ever {{since the}} first satellite, ETS- 1, in 1975, 28 NASDA {{satellites}} in total have been launched. With regards to <b>satellite</b> <b>operations,</b> NASDA has developed realtime TLM/CMD processing systems which could be commonly used for different types of satellite. Presently the third generation system is operational. Meanwhile, the recent trend of <b>satellite</b> <b>operations</b> is becoming more complicated, for example, CCSDS-adapted Satellites are emerging and computer technology is developing quite rapidly. Moreover, NASDA's role in <b>satellite</b> <b>operations</b> is changing from mainly <b>Satellite</b> Bus <b>operations</b> to experimental/whole <b>satellite</b> missions <b>operations.</b> Considering these circumstances, NASDA has initiated a study {{for the next generation}} system which is suitable for <b>operations</b> of future <b>satellites</b> keeping in mind the following viewpoints: (1) demands from mission support; (2) trend of satellite design; and (3) progress of computer environment. This is an interim report of the study...|$|R
