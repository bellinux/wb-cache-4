5|$|Gough Whitlam {{saw that}} the party had little chance of being elected unless it could expand its appeal from the {{traditional}} working-class base to include the suburban middle class. He sought to <b>shift</b> <b>control</b> of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party, and hoped that even rank-and-file party members could be given {{a voice in the}} conference. In 1968, controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate Brian Harradine, a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist. Whitlam resigned the leadership, demanding a vote of confidence from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38–32 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.|$|E

(Harrison later started Harrisongs, and Starr created Startling Music). Apple's greatest publishing successes were the Badfinger hits [...] "No Matter What", [...] "Day After Day" [...] and [...] "Baby Blue", all written by group member Pete Ham, and Badfinger's [...] "Without You", a song penned by Ham and Badfinger band mate Tom Evans. [...] "Without You" [...] became a worldwide No. 1 chart hit for Harry Nilsson in 1972 and Mariah Carey in 1993. In 2005, however, Apple lost the US publishing rights for the work of Ham and Evans. Those rights were transferred to Bug Music, now a branch of BMG Rights Management.|$|E
40|$|For decades, load <b>shifting</b> <b>control,</b> one of most {{effective}} peak demand management methods, has attracted increasing attentions from both researchers and engineers. Different load <b>shifting</b> <b>control</b> strategies {{have been developed}} when diverse cold thermal energy storage facilities are used in commercial buildings. The facilities include building thermal mass (BTM), thermal energy storage system (TES) and phase change material (PCM).

5000|$|The {{development}} of a rating curve involves two steps. In the first step the relationship between stage and discharge is established by measuring the stage and corresponding discharge in the river. And in the second part, stage of river is measured and discharge is calculated by using the relationship established in the first part. Stage is measured by reading a gauge installed in the river. If the stage-discharge relationship does not change with time, it is called permanent control. If the relationship does change, it is called <b>shifting</b> <b>control.</b> <b>Shifting</b> <b>control</b> is usually due to erosion or deposition of sediment at the stage measurement site. Bedrock-bottomed parts of rivers or concrete/metal weirs or structures are often, though not always, permanent controls.|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} and energy loss in a <b>shifting</b> <b>control</b> system {{is important and}} necessary in the performance improvement of an automatic transmission. The direct operating solenoid valve has been considered as a potential component applying in the <b>shifting</b> <b>control</b> system in vehicle. The previous method can solve only a specific physical field or use the test results of the magnetic force as input curve. The paper presents a numerical approach for solving the multi-domain physical problem of the valve. A precise model of the direct acting solenoid valve considering different physical field is developed. An experimental study is also performed to evaluate and confirm the simulation. Based on the model, the influences on the {{dynamic characteristics}} of the valve are analyzed by calculating forces acting on the valve. The systematic analysis of forces and energy loss characteristics are performed for three different flow conditions varying clearance height from 10 µm to 30 µm. The results demonstrate that the pressure response time can be improved with smaller clearance between the spool and the sleeve. Moreover, the leakage of the <b>shifting</b> <b>control</b> system employing the direct acting solenoid valve can be reduced by 60 % compared to the conventional two-stage pilot valve in our previous product...|$|R
