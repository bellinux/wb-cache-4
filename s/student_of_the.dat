5|$|Adolf Hitler summoned Lieutenant-General Kurt <b>Student</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 7. Flieger-Division (7th Air Division) {{to discuss}} the assault. It was first {{suggested}} that a conventional parachute drop be made by airborne forces to seize and destroy the forts' guns before the land units approached. Such a suggestion was rejected as the Junkers Ju 52 transports were too slow and {{were likely to be}} vulnerable to Dutch and Belgian anti-aircraft guns. Other factors for its refusal were the weather conditions, which might blow the paratroopers away from the fort and disperse them too widely. A seven-second drop from a Ju 52 at minimum operational height led to a dispersion over 300metres alone.|$|E

He declined, believing that an author's merit could only be determined by the posthumous verdict of history. 1946 saw the publication, as The Crime of Imprisonment, of the preface Shaw had written 20 years previously to a study of prison conditions.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine <b>the</b> determinants <b>of</b> and differences between <b>the</b> ethical beliefs <b>of</b> two groups <b>of</b> Japanese <b>students</b> in religious and secular universities. Multiple regression analysis revealed that <b>students</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese religious university perceived that young, male, relativistic, and opportunistic students tended to behave less ethically than did older, female, and idealistic <b>students.</b> <b>Students</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese secular university perceived that male, achievement-oriented, and opportunistic students tended to behave less ethically than did female and experience-oriented students. Opportunism was found to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important determinants in explaining misconduct. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) revealed that <b>students</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese secular university tended to score higher on achievement and humanism, and lower on theism and positivism than did <b>students</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese religious university.

LaMoreaux also examined trachytic lava flows from Koosick Bluff and Triangle Dome, a trachytic lava dome which last erupted during the Pleistocene period. Other studies by LaMoreaux determined criteria for understanding how lava flow thickness {{may or may not}} be an indication that the progress of a lava flow was impeded by an ice barrier, resulting in an unusually thick lava flow.|$|E

Voluntary male and female <b>students</b> <b>of</b> 1 st and 6 th year were measured and their BMI values and percentage of body fat values were recorded using methods of bioimpedance measurement and questionnaires targeting their lifestyles and eating habits. A total <b>of</b> 35 female <b>students</b> <b>of</b> 1 st year was measured as compared to 27 in their 6 th year of studies and a total <b>of</b> 27 male <b>students</b> <b>of</b> 1 st year compared to 7 in the 6 th year.

The following year, the company co-produced the critically acclaimed drama The Lunchbox, which was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. Dharma Productions' greatest successes in the 2010s came with the social drama My Name Is Khan (2010), the 2012 remake of Agneepath, the romantic comedy-drama Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013), the romantic drama 2 States (2014), the family drama Kapoor & Sons (2016), the romance Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016), and the romantic comedy Badrinath Ki Dulhania (2017).

5|$|His feet {{position}} were peculiar in {{that his}} front foot was {{parallel to the}} crease and his back foot perpendicular, {{the opposite of the}} conventional posture. This inhibited his follow through and put more stress on his ankles and shins. As a result, his right ankle had to be bound tightly in order to prevent jarring from his awkward delivery. He also followed the recommendation of Bill O'Reilly and tied a towel around his shins to cut off the circulation and to dull the pain. After the knee injury, he altered his action into a more conventional one so that his front foot pointed towards the batsman. This eased the pressure on his body, but his ability to move the ball diminished. Johnston was a keen <b>student</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, and although he did not see a state match until his debut, and watched only one Test before his debut, he supplemented his knowledge by reading cricket books.

5|$|Louis-François Bertin was 66 in 1832, {{the year}} of the portrait.

In either case the genesis of the {{commission}} is unknown. Bertin was a leader of the French upper class and a supporter of Louis Philippe and the Bourbon Restoration. He was a director of the Le Moniteur Universel until 1823, when the Journal des débats became the recognised voice of the liberal-constitutional opposition after he had come to criticize absolutism. He eventually gave his support to the July Monarchy. The Journal supported contemporary art, and Bertin was a patron, collector and cultivator of writers, painters and other artists. Ingres was sufficiently intrigued by Bertin's personality to accept the commission.|$|E
5|$|One day, Indra, {{the king}} of the Devas (celestial deities), {{disguised}} as a Brahmin, approaches Karnan and asks for his armour and ear rings in donation to weaken and stop him from overpowering Arjuna. Aware of Indra's intention, Karnan yet donates both the items he was born with and which would make him invincible. Pleased with Karnan's generosity, Indra gives him a powerful weapon, Nagastra, but states that he can use it only once. Karnan, disguised as a Brahmin, becomes the <b>student</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sage Parasurama to acquire the Brahmastra; one day, however, Parasurama realises that Karnan is a Kshatriya, a tribe he opposes. Enraged, he renders Karnan incapable of using the Brahmastra when most needed, and banishes him.|$|E
