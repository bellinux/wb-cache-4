5|$|The killings {{exacerbated}} {{tensions between}} the Partisans and Chetniks.

5|$|Before Romney took over, {{the event}} was $379million short of its revenue goals. Officials had made plans to <b>scale</b> <b>back</b> the Games to {{compensate}} for the fiscal crisis, and there were fears it might be moved away entirely. In addition, the image of the Games had been damaged by allegations of bribery against top officials including prior committee president and CEO Frank Joklik. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee forced Joklik and committee vice president Dave Johnson to resign. Utah power brokers, including Governor Mike Leavitt, searched for someone with a scandal-free reputation to take charge of the Olympics. They chose Romney based on his business and legal expertise as well as his connections to both the LDS Church and the state. The appointment faced some initial criticism from both non-Mormons and Mormons that it represented cronyism and made the Games seem too Mormon-dominated.|$|E

5|$|The {{rise of the}} {{internet}} has resulted in many broadcasters ceasing their shortwave transmissions in favor of broadcasting over the world wide web. When BBC World Service discontinued service to Europe, North America, Australasia, and the Caribbean, it generated many protests and activist {{groups such as the}} Coalition to Save the BBC World Service. In the US, the shifting of resources from shortwave to Internet and television by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees U.S. international broadcasting, has also resulted in reduced broadcasting hours in the English language. Radio Netherlands, Voice of Russia (formerly Radio Moscow), Radio Canada International and Radio Australia are among the prominent broadcasters who have ceased broadcasting on shortwave. Although most of the prominent broadcasters continue to <b>scale</b> <b>back</b> their analog shortwave transmissions or completely terminate them, shortwave is still very common and active in developing regions such as parts of Africa.|$|E
5|$|Because of Alyx's {{significant}} {{involvement in}} the game, Valve made modifications to her AI that allowed her {{to react to the}} player's actions. Modifications include commentating on objects the player manipulates or obstacles they have overcome. She also acts as an important device in both plot exposition and directing the player's journey, often vocalizing what the player is required to do next to progress. The developers explained that a large part of their focus was creating not only a believable companion for the player, but also one that did not obstruct the player's actions. They wanted to allow the player to dictate his/her own pace and method of overcoming any challenges faced without being hindered. This meant that Valve often had to <b>scale</b> <b>back</b> Alyx's input and dialogue during the player's journey so they would not feel pressured to progress and consequently object to her presence. The developers also placed what they described as hero moments throughout the game, which allow the player to single-handedly overcome obstacles such as particularly challenging enemies, during which Alyx takes the role of an observer and gives the player praise and adulation for their heroic feats. Play testers were used extensively by the developers throughout the entirety of the game's creation in order for Valve to continually gauge the effectiveness of in-game scenarios as well as the difficulty.|$|E
5|$|West made a {{conscious}} decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to <b>scale</b> <b>back</b> on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was brought on by the alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E

5|$|On August 13, 2015, {{as part of}} {{a five-year}} {{programming}} and development deal, Sesame Workshop announced that first-run episodes of Sesame Street would move to premium television service HBO (which had not aired any original children's programming since 2005) in late 2015. Sesame Workshop sought the deal because of declining revenue from viewer donations, and decreases in distribution fees paid by PBS member stations and licensing for merchandise sales (particularly through Sesame Workshop's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales), with the intent to having the show remain on PBS in some fashion (HBO already had involvement in public television {{at the time of the}} deal, providing funding for the talk show Charlie Rose); the deal also came in the wake of changing viewer habits of American children over the previous ten years. HBO will hold first-run rights to all newer episodes of the series starting with season 46, after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine-month exclusivity window, with no charge to the stations for airing the content; however, HBO has not announced whether first-run episodes will air on the pay service's main channel or its multiplex channel HBO Family. The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream past and future Sesame Street episodes on HBO Go and HBO Now – assuming those rights from Amazon Video and Netflix. On August 14, Sesame Workshop announced that it would phase out its in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, as a standalone service; instead of shutting it down entirely, it intends to <b>scale</b> <b>back</b> its offerings to either provide access to a reduced slate of free content or act as a portal for Sesame Streets website.|$|E
