Data for analysis came from the Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys (KDHS) of 1988 / 89 and 1993. The hypothesis was that, women who migrate comprise those that act rationally to maximise other lifetime aspirations {{at the expense of}} reproductive behaviours. That is, migrants are involved in behaviours that negatively influence fertility determining factor of marriage compared to that of never-migrants. The paper contended that, migration dynamics are important in determining reproductive behaviour of women through time and space. The methods of estimating the association between migration process and marital behaviours were undertaken through several analysis techniques: <b>Singulate</b> mean age at marriage (SMAM); ordinary least squares (OLS) and; logistic regression (LR). <b>Singulate</b> mean age at marriage estimated patterns of marriage by migration status by background variables. Ordinary least square regression was used to identify the impact of migration process on marriage behaviour relative to other factors. Logistic regression determined the probability that a woman will marry early or late among the migrants and never-migrants. Findings confirmed that migration negatively affects age at first marriage.

In the EWLP approach, the <b>singulated</b> dies are embedded within the molding compound through the wafer level compression molding process. For this study, critical mechanical challenges such as die shift and thermal cycling performance of a multi-chip embedded wafer level package (MCEWLP) are addressed through numerical modeling.

Mechanical effects account for around 75 % of the die shift while fluidic effect contributes to the remaining 25 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Marriage is a {{significant}} event in life-course of individuals, and creates a system that characterizes societal and economic structures. Marital patterns and dynamics {{over the years have}} changed a lot, with decreasing proportions of marriage, increased levels of divorce and co-habitation in developing countries. Although, such changes have been reported in African societies including Namibia, they have largely remained unexplained. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: IN THIS PAPER, WE EXAMINED TRENDS AND PATTERNS OF MARITAL STATUS OF WOMEN OF MARRIAGEABLE AGE: 15 to 49 years, in Namibia using the 1992, 2000 and 2006 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data. Trends were established for selected demographic variables. Two binary logistic regression models for ever-married versus never married, and cohabitation versus married were fitted to establish factors associated with such nuptial systems. Further a multinomial logistic regression models, adjusted for bio-demographic and socio-economic variables, were fitted separately for each year, to establish determinants of type of union (never married, married and cohabitation). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate a general change away from marriage, with a shift in <b>singulate</b> mean age at marriage. Cohabitation was prevalent among those less than 30 years of age, the odds were higher in urban areas and increased since 1992. Be as it may marriage remained a persistent nuptiality pattern, and common among the less educated and employed, but lower odds in urban areas. Results from multinomial model suggest that marital status was associated with age at marriage, total children born, region, place of residence, education level and religion. We conclude that marital patterns have undergone significant transformation {{over the past two decades}} in Namibia, with a coexistence of traditional marriage framework with co-habitation, and sizeable proportion remaining unmarried to the late 30 s.

Considering the great variation of particle size from micrometer to millimeter, the powders greater than 250 [*]μm were photographed by a flatbed scanner without zoom function, and the others were photographed using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with high-image resolution.

Due to the short interaction time between laser and material, small kerf widths, marginal heat affected zones and minimal edge damaging are attainable. While a reduction of the kerf width leads to a higher yield per wafer, minimal thermal and mechanical damage increases the breaking strength of each die [2].

The electrical performance and characterization of the TSVs is also discussed. The interposers are created at 200 mm or 300 mm silicon wafers. The fabrication processes include deep reactive ion etching, TSV side wall isolation, PVD seed layer deposition, TSV filling by copper electroplating, wafer front side redistribution, temporary wafer bonding, wafer thinning by mechanical grinding, CMP, silicon dry etching, PECVD, silicon oxide dry etching and wafer backside redistribution. Depending on the final device application, after backside processing a component assembly is done directly at the interposer backside. In other cases, the interposer wafers are either released from the carrier wafers or transfer bonded so that their front side can be accessed again and the component assembly can be done. Finally, the assembled interposers can be release from their carrier wafers and <b>singulated</b> or run into further processes like molding or hermetic sealing by wafer to wafer bonding using suitable capwafers. In the following sections, important technological aspects of interposer fabrication and assembly as well as results from electrical characterizations will be presented.
