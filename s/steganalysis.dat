5000|$|In steganography, {{attempts}} to detect hidden signals in suspected carrier material {{is referred to}} as <b>steganalysis.</b> <b>Steganalysis</b> has an interesting difference from most other types of detection, in that it can often only determine the probability that a hidden message exists; this is in contrast to the detection of signals which are simply encrypted, as the ciphertext can often be identified with certainty, even if it cannot be decoded.|$|E

5000|$|The goal of <b>steganalysis</b> is to {{identify}} suspected packages, {{determine whether or not}} they have a payload encoded into them, and, if possible, recover that payload.|$|E
50|$|The cover file {{manipulation}} algorithm used {{is based}} on fixed location LSB insertion, making its output images detectable to most <b>steganalysis</b> software by a simply Histogram Characteristic Function.|$|E
50|$|This form of {{steganography}} {{was proposed}} jointly by Eiji Kawaguchi and Richard O. Eason in 1998. Their experimental program (titled Qtech Hide & View) is freely available for educational purposes. Recently, many researchers are tackling its algorithm improvement and applications {{as well as}} resistibility studies against <b>steganalysis.</b>|$|E
50|$|According to Jeffrey Carr, a 2007 {{edition of}} Technical Mujahid (a {{bi-monthly}} terrorist publication) outlined {{the importance of}} using a steganography program called Secrets of the Mujahideen. According to Carr, the program was touted as giving the user the capability to avoid detection by current <b>steganalysis</b> programs. It did this {{through the use of}} steganography in conjunction with file compression.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Memon was {{featured}} in the NBC investigative report on terror alerts raised due to bogus analysis. He discussed the art of secret writing called steganography, which allows two parties {{to communicate with each}} other without others knowing they are communicating, and how <b>steganalysis</b> software can be used to locate those hidden messages, but it is not always reliable.|$|E
5000|$|Data, before carrier injection, is {{encrypted}} and whitened: a {{small amount}} of hidden data turns into a big chunk of pseudorandom [...] "suspicious data". Carrier injection encodes it using a non linear covering function that takes also original carrier bits as input. Modified carriers will need much less change (Con1) and, lowering their random-like statistical response, deceive many <b>steganalysis</b> tests (Con2).|$|E
50|$|Unlike cryptanalysis, {{where it}} is obvious that intercepted data {{contains}} a message (though that message is encrypted), <b>steganalysis</b> generally starts with a pile of suspect data files, but little information about which of the files, if any, contain a payload. The steganalyst is usually something of a forensic statistician, and must start by reducing this set of data files (which is often quite large; in many cases, it may be the entire set of files on a computer) to the subset most likely to have been altered.|$|E
50|$|In computing, steganographically encoded package {{detection}} {{is called}} <b>steganalysis.</b> The simplest method to detect modified files, however, {{is to compare}} them to known originals. For example, to detect information being moved through the graphics on a website, an analyst can maintain known clean copies of the materials and then compare them against the current contents of the site. The differences, if the carrier is the same, comprise the payload. In general, using extremely high compression rates makes steganography difficult but not impossible. Compression errors provide a hiding place for data, but high compression reduces the amount of data available to hold the payload, raising the encoding density, which facilitates easier detection (in extreme cases, even by casual observation).|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{difficult}} task of <b>steganalysis,</b> or the detection {{of the presence of}} hidden data, can be greatly aided by exploiting the correlations inherent in typical host or cover signals. In particular, several effective image <b>steganalysis</b> techniques are based on the strong interpixel dependencies exhibited by natural images. Thus, existing theoretical benchmarks based on independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) models for the cover data underestimate attainable <b>steganalysis</b> performance and, hence, overestimate the security of the steganography technique used for hiding the data. In this paper, we investigate detection-theoretic performance benchmarks for <b>steganalysis</b> when the cover data are modeled as a Markov chain. The main application explored here is <b>steganalysis</b> of data hidden in images. While the Markov chain model does not completely capture the spatial dependencies, it provides an analytically tractable framework whose predictions are consistent with the performance of practical <b>steganalysis</b> algorithms that account for spatial dependencies. Numerical results are provided for image <b>steganalysis</b> of spread-spectrum and perturbed quantization data hiding.

40|$|Recently, merging signal {{processing}} techniques with information security services {{has found a}} lot of attention. Steganography and <b>steganalysis</b> are among those trends. Like their counterparts in cryptology, steganography and <b>steganalysis</b> are in a constant battle. Steganography methods try to hide the presence of covert messages in innocuous-looking data, whereas <b>steganalysis</b> methods try to reveal existence of such messages and to break steganography methods. The stream nature of audio signals, their popularity, and their wide spread usage make them very suitable media for steganography.

A mathematically formal definition of <b>steganalysis</b> is given. Then active <b>steganalysis,</b> defined as the extraction of a hidden message {{with little or no}} a priori information, is formulated as a blind system identification problem within this framework.

The proposed technique is observed to produce impressive results for a variety of performance measures. Based on the results we conclude that a common belief, namely, spread spectrum steganography/watermarking, is secure because the low strength, noise-like message carrier is no longer valid within the current context.

Steganography in the modern day sense of the word usually refers to information or a file that has been concealed inside a digital Picture, Video or Audio file. In steganography, the actual information is not maintained in its original format and thereby it is converted into an alternative equivalent multimedia file like image, video or audio, which in turn is being hidden within another object.
