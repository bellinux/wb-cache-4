5|$|Howe was {{determined}} that the pipeline not be delayed, and proposed that the government advance money to the pipeline company to ensure construction in 1956. He emotionally pleaded with his Cabinet colleagues, who agreed both to the proposal and {{to the use of}} rarely used closure to limit the debate. Closure had not been applied in the House since 1932. The issue was attractive to the Tories and CCF with an election due within two years; it would allow them to portray Howe as an arrogant dictator, and play to those citizens who disliked the American involvement in the pipeline project. If the bill did not receive Royal Assent by 7 June 1956, options that Trans-Canada held for <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> would expire.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} then-champion Petey Williams against Kaz {{in the opening}} contest of the telecast. Williams was {{accompanied}} by Rhaka Khan and Scott Steiner. The duration of the bout was 15 minutes and 19 seconds. Williams wore a protective face mask due to a broken orbital bone. Khan and Steiner interfered in the bout several times. Kaz was legitimately busted open during the match after Williams bashed {{him in the face}} with a <b>steel</b> <b>pipe.</b> Williams won the encounter after performing his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver by slamming Kaz head-first into the mat to retain the TNA X Division Championship. Abyss returned after this match by aiding Kaz who was being attacked by Khan, Steiner, and Williams.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness for the prosecution, came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August. Another said that the <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of economical construction of infrastructures has recently increased. The application of spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> to bridge piers is {{considered as one}} of the effective methods. Spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> have been seldom used for bridge piers. Currently, spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> have been mainly used as the foundations of buildings or bridges and are relatively economical because they are produced in large quantities in factories. However, roll forming processes of spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> are different from those of bending roll pipes which have been generally used as bridge piers, so that seismic performance of spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> may be different from that of bending roll pipes. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} grasp the ultimate strength and the ductility of spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes.</b> In this study, the finite element analysis was conducted for grasping the elasto-plastic behavior of hollow spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes.</b> Based on the analysis results, the seismic performance of hollow spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> under compressive axial force and bending moment was examined and the influences of the structural parameters on the seismic performances of the spiral <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Three Way {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and challengers Kaz and Scott SteinerSteiner was {{accompanied}} by Petey Williams and Rhaka Khan. At {{the beginning of the}} bout, Joe placed Kaz and Steiner in various holds and submission maneuvers. Steiner countered this by placing Joe in his signature Steiner Recliner submission maneuver, which Joe escaped by lifting him in the air on his shoulders. Kaz then jumped off of a turnbuckle and dropkicked Steiner. Later, Joe dove through the second rope onto Steiner. However, Steiner countered by hitting Joe {{in the head with a}} <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> while the referee was distracted by Khan. Near the end of the match, Kaz tried to perform his signature Flux Capacitor maneuver on Steiner from a turnbuckle, but Steiner countered by pushing him off to the ringside area. Joe then kicked Steiner in the head and then performed his signature Muscle Buster maneuver, driving Steiner neck- and back-first into the mat, at fourteen minutes and thirty seconds to win the contest and retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

40|$|High {{strength}} <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> {{have found}} increasing applications in deep high pressure offshore oil/gas lines. High strength <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> have found increasing applications in deep high pressure offshore oil/gas lines. Damages {{in the form}} of dent are among common causes of pipeline failure. Indentation, plastic buckling and residual strength of dented normal grade <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> under bending, axial and combined loading have previously been addressed by a number of researchers. The plastic buckling and collapse of dented high grades <b>steel</b> line <b>pipes,</b> however, have received less previous attentions. In the current study an experimental model testing was used to evaluate the residual strength of dented X 80 <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> under monotonic axial compression. The tubular specimens were first laterally dented by an indentor while resting on a saddle shape support. The specimens were then examined under axial compression to study the dent effects on their collapse behaviour. Numerical simulations were also used to analyse the effect of the indentor ratio, shape and alignment on the residual strength of dented steel tubes under monotonic axial compression. The results from the current study on high strength steels were also compared with semi-empirical equations available in the literature for low strength steels. It was found that these equations provide reasonable predictions for the axial residual capacity of the high strength <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> when the dent depths are small. With deep dents, however, they considerably underestimate the axial residual capacity of the high strength <b>steel</b> <b>pipes...</b>|$|R

25|$|Metal liners may be {{stainless}} steel, aluminum, or {{galvanized iron}} {{and may be}} flexible or rigid pipes. Stainless steel is made in several types and thicknesses. Type 304 is used with firewood, wood pellet fuel, and non-condensing oil appliances, types 316 and 321 with coal, and type AL 29-4C is used with non-condensing gas appliances. Stainless steel liners must have a cap and be insulated if they service solid fuel appliances, but following the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Aluminum and galvanized steel chimneys are known as class A and class B chimneys. Class A are either an insulated, double wall stainless <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> or triple wall, air-insulated pipe often known by its genericized trade name Metalbestos. Class B are uninsulated double wall pipes often called B-vent, and are only used to vent non-condensing gas appliances. These may have an aluminum inside layer and galvanized steel outside layer.

25|$|Hitman: Absolution is a stealth {{video game}} in which the player assumes {{the role of a}} hitman named Agent 47. Presented from a third-person perspective, the {{gameplay}} centers around completing set objectives within a series of levels. Objectives can range from simply reaching the end of the level, to killing specific individuals. Players choose how to complete each level, taking branching paths to get to a target or location. Players may use pistols, bottles or bricks, assault rifles, shotguns, fiber-wire, or <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> against enemies if opting for the action-oriented approach, or avoid enemies altogether, not being seen, using disguises, blending into the environment, and only attacking the set target(s), if using the stealth-oriented approach. Agent 47 also has the 'Instinct' ability that lets the player monitor enemies more easily. There are also environmental ways to kill or distract individuals; players can use poison to spike coffee, pull switches to make a disco ball fall and break, cause a massive explosion at a gas station, pull a switch to cause scaffolding to fall down, cause fires, or set off fireworks. Players complete chapters in order to progress through the story.
