40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the arrangement of wood strands at the surface of oriented strand board (OSB) by image analysis. Two-dimensional image analysis enables the number of <b>strands</b> and the <b>area</b> of each <b>strand</b> to be computed. In addition, the fiber direction of each strand may be measured manually by recording the acute angle between the fiber direction and the longitudinal axis of the specimen. The image analysis results suggest the following. the average <b>strand</b> <b>area</b> is proportional to the reciprocal of the number of strands. Samples containing many smaller strands exhibit a larger variation in strand size. The average <b>strand</b> <b>area</b> does not correlate with the distribution of the <b>strand</b> <b>area</b> represented by the coefficient of variation. However, there is a reasonable correlation between the number of smaller strands in the range 0 to 1 cm(2) and the coefficient of variation of <b>strand</b> <b>area.</b> At low average fiber orientations, i. e. better orientation with the principal panel axis, there is smaller variability in orientation. The upper side and lower side of OSB exhibit a different relationship between average fiber orientation and <b>strand</b> <b>area.</b> The upper side of the specimens contains larger strands and exhibits better fiber orientation than the lower side. This is thought to be a function of the production process. The lower side strands fall on a smooth moving substrate, whereas the upper side strands fall on a stable substrate of strands. The number of strands is lower on the upper side of the OSB panel because small size strands tend to migrate to the lower side of the OSB during production. The small particles tend to be vibrated through the strand mat to the lower face before pressing...|$|R

50|$|The McCartney {{family had}} lived in the Short <b>Strand</b> <b>area</b> of Belfast for five generations. However some local people in the Short <b>Strand</b> <b>area,</b> which is a largely Nationalist area, did not welcome their dispute with the IRA. A {{campaign}} of intimidation by Republicans drove members of the family and Robert's former fiancée, to relocate and has also caused one member to close her business in the city centre. Intimidation was continuing as of 2008. The last McCartney sister to leave the area (Paula) departed Short Strand on 26 October 2005.|$|R
40|$|Fish {{stranding}} is {{a critical}} issue in rivers with peaking operations. The ability to accurately predict potential <b>stranding</b> <b>areas</b> can become a decisive factor to assess environmental impacts and to plan mitigation measures. The presented work shows that common procedures suggested in the literature {{in the use of}} one-dimensional (1 D) models for flood zone mapping are not always applicable to compute <b>stranding</b> <b>areas.</b> Specific and easy-to-understand guidance needs to be given for smaller-scale issues. We provide specific guidelines to accurately predict potential <b>stranding</b> <b>areas</b> in a cost-effective manner. By analysing four different river morphologies in detail in a peaking river, we find that the optimal geometry effort (number of cross sections) does not necessarily coincide with the maximum and it varies between channel types according to river physical characteristics such as sinuosity and channel complexity. The use of a 1 D model can provide good estimates with an optimal geometry layout...|$|R
