40|$|Proper thermal {{management}} {{is important for}} optimum performance and durability of most electric-vehicle batteries. For high-temperature cells such as sodium/sulphur, a very efficient and responsive thermal control system is essential. Heat must be removed during exothermic periods and retained when the batteries are not in use. Current {{thermal management}} approaches rely on passive insulation enclosures with active cooling loops that penetrate the enclosure. This paper presents the design, analysis, and testing of an enclosure with variable conductance insulation (VCI). VCI uses a hydride with an integral electric resistance heater to expel and retrieve {{a small amount of}} hydrogen gas into a vacuum space. By controlling the amount of hydrogen gas, the thermal conductance can be varied by more than 100 : 1, enabling the cooling loop (cold plate) to be mounted on the enclosure exterior. By not penetrating the battery enclosure, the cooling system is simpler and more reliable. Also, heat can be retained more effectively when desired. For high temperatures, radiation shields within the vacuum space are required. Ceramic spacers are used to maintain separation of the steel enclosure materials against atmospheric loading. Ceramic-to-ceramic thermal contact resistance within the <b>spacer</b> <b>assembly</b> minimizes thermal conductance. Two full-scale (0. 8 -m {times} 0. 9 -m {times} 0. 3 -m) prototypes were designed, built, and tested under high-temperature 200 {degrees}- 350 {degrees}C battery conditions. With an internal temperature of 330 {degrees}C (and 20 {degrees}C ambient), the measured total-enclosure minimum heat loss was 80 watts (excluding wire pass-through losses). The maximum heat rejection was 4100 watts. The insulation can be switched from minimum to maximum conductance (hydrogen pressure from 2. 0 {times} 10 {sup - 3 } to 8 torr) in 3 minutes. Switching from maximum to minimum conductance was longer (16 minutes), but still satisfactory because of the large thermal mass of the battery...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A <b>spacer</b> grid <b>assembly,</b> {{which is}} an {{interconnected}} array of slotted grid straps welded at the intersections to form an egg crate structure, {{is one of the}} core structural components for the nuclear fuel assemblies of a Pressurized light Water Reactor (PWR). The commercial <b>spacer</b> grid <b>assembly</b> is spot-welded at the crossing points of the intersections by a TIG welding, LASER beam welding or Electron beam welding method. In this study, a LASER beam welding apparatus and a method for an inner strap welding has been proposed to obtain a longer and finer weld line and a smaller weld bead size for a <b>spacer</b> grid <b>assembly</b> for a PWR fuel assembly. Also a rapid welding and excellent weld quality have been achieved by the proposed welding apparatus and method...|$|R

This work {{deals with a}} demonstrative application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for design optimisation. A commercial CFD code was applied to simulate the flow within Atucha-II reactor coolant channels and to assess the resulting pressure losses. Two types of grid were simulated, i. e. the so-called “elastic spacer” and “rigid spacer”, which are made from different materials and have totally different geometries. Both designs are planned to be adopted in Atucha-II reactor. The turbulence model and the grid {{need to be addressed}} to have a confidence in the results.

40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on {{calculation}} of the friction forces work in the contact of nuclear fuel rods with fuel <b>assembly</b> <b>spacer</b> grid cells. This friction work is deciding factor for the prediction of the fuel rod coating abrasion. The fuel rod abrasion is caused by fuel assembly vibrations excited by pressure pulsations of the cooling liquid generated by main circulation pumps. A prediction of fuel rod coating abrasion makes use of experimentally investigated dependence of the abrasion on the friction force work in laboratory conditions.

40|$|The {{structural}} design and configuration feasibility {{of the long}} <b>spacer</b> truss <b>assembly</b> {{that will be used}} as part of the Space Station Freedom is the focus of this study. The structural analysis discussed herein is derived from the transient loading events presented in the Space Transportation System Interface Control Document (STS ICD). The transient loading events are liftoff, landing, and emergency landing loads. Quasi-static loading events were neglected in this study since the magnitude of the quasi-static acceleration factors is lower than that of the transient acceleration factors. Structural analysis of the proposed configuration of the long spacer truss with four longerons indicated that negative safety margins are possible. As a result, configuration changes were proposed. The primary configuration change suggested was {{to increase the number of}} truss longerons to six. The six-longeron truss appears to be a more promising structure than the four-longeron truss because it offers a positive margin of safety and more volume in its second bay (BAY 2). This additional volume can be used for resupply of some of the orbital replacement units (such as a battery box). Note that the design effort on the long spacer truss has not fully begun and that calculations and reports of the negative safety margins are, to date, based on concept only...|$|R
40|$|For nickel-containing alloys {{irradiated}} in thermalized neutron fluxes, {{the formation}} and reaction of 59 Ni with thermal neutrons can lead to time-varying changes in displacement damage rate, expressed as displacements per atom per second (dpa. s- 1), gas formation and nuclear heating. Ni-rich alloys are used in PWR and BWR reactors as <b>spacers</b> within fuel <b>assemblies</b> but also as tensioning springs for these same assemblies. Flux thimbles have also been made from Ni-rich alloys {{in the past but}} are gradually being replaced by thimbles made from other alloys containing substantially less Ni. In a CANDU reactor, Ni-alloys are used as tensioning springs, fuel channel spacers (in the form of garter springs) and as cable sheathing and core wires in flux-detector assemblies. Prediction of the irradiationprocesses that affect the functionality of these CANDU internals, such as irradiation embrittlement and irradiation creep, especially under conditions of extended operation, necessitates a consideration of the effect of the transmutation of Ni. Over the past 10 years, there has been a considerable increase in the understanding of the effects of irradiation on the properties of components made from Ni-rich alloys. The nuclear processes and the effects of irradiation damage on the performance of components made from these alloys will be described...|$|R
40|$|A 1 OOOMWth liquid-salt cooled thermal {{spectrum}} reactor was designed {{with a long}} fuel cycle, and high core exit temperature. These features are desirable in a reactor designed to provide process heat applications such as oil refinery needs of heat and electricity. The reactor uses the binary salt NaF-BeF₂ as the primary coolant, and uses U-Zr-H as fuel and to provide neutron moderation. Design options were studied under the constraints of maximum fuel temperature of 720 [degree]C, and a vessel wall temperature similar to today's reactors (i. e. limited to 430 [degree]C). The selected design achieves a core power density of 26. 35 kW/ 1 and can achieve a 10 year core lifetime before refueling. The core has a pressure drop of 1. 03 MPa, and uses a hexagonal lattice with small, 7 mm outer diameter fuel pins. The pins are arranged in a tight 1. 08 pitch-to-diameter ratio, and use wire wrap <b>spacers</b> and <b>assembly</b> ducts for mechanical support. Silicon carbide is used for cladding, and the fuel-clad gap is filled with a low-melting point liquid metal {{to act as a}} thermal bond between the fuel and the cladding. The core is encircled with two rows of reflector assemblies and one row of thermal shield assemblies. A layer of graphite provides thermal insulation to the reactor vessel. (cont.) The primary coolant is coupled to a CO₂ power cycle via heat exchangers located above the core in the same vessel. The reactor vessel is 8. 5 m in diameter and 15. 3 m tall, which achieves the goal of a vessel that can be produced off-site and transported via barge, but not by truck or train. The intermediate heat exchanger is designed with 1 cm outer diameter tubing with internal helical ribs. The tubes are arranged in a square array with a pitch to diameter ratio of 1. 2. With a core exit temperature of 570 [degree]C, the supercritical CO₂ power conversion system achieves, according to previous studies at MIT, a net efficiency of 45. 7 %. A comparison is made to other integral medium reactors (i. e those with the heat exchanger and the core in the same vessel). This reactor has the advantage of low pressure and high thermal conversion ratio compared to the IRIS water cooled reactor. by Joshua Whitman. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Retroviral {{assembly}} {{is mediated}} by the Gag polyprotein comprised of the matrix (MA), capsid (CA) and nucleocapsid (NC) domains as well as <b>spacer</b> peptides. During <b>assembly,</b> thousands of copies of the myristoylated Gag protein assemble on the host plasma membrane and through unknown Gag-Gag interactions bud to form an immature particle. Subsequent to budding, maturation begins, during which the viral protease cleaves Gag releasing its mature domains. The matrix remains associated with the membrane, and CA condenses to enclose NC and the RNA genome. Formation of the capsid core is critical for infectivity and represents a potential target for new HIV- 1 therapeutic agents. Towards this end, we have identified compounds that bind to an apical cleft on the capsid protein using an in silico screening method. One such agent, CAP- 1, drastically reduced infectivity in vivo, with no cell toxicity, and acted only at the assembly stage of the lifecycle, consistent with a novel mechanism of inhibition. In order to structurally understand the mechanism of inhibition, we solved {{the structure of the}} CAP- 1 :CA complex using a combination of NMR and X-ray crystallography. Our combined structural studies show that CAP- 1 induces a conformational change in the side chain of Phe 32 of CA to adopt an exposed state, opening a deep pocket for the phenyl moiety of CAP- 1 to bind, while the urea moiety forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl of Val 59. The unfavorable extrusion of Phe 32 is balanced by the relief of main chain strain and may represent a process necessary for assembly of the virus.; Further knowledge of the Gag interactions critical for trafficking, assembly and maturation would allow for the rational design of other agents to further expand this new class of HIV- 1 assembly inhibitors. In solution Gag is believed to exist in a monomer-trimer equilibrium {{due in part to the}} myristyl switch mechanism. We have therefore designed chimeric constructs using coiled-coil peptides (GCN 4) to mimic assembly competent trimeric Gag constructs. NMR structural studies of the GCN 4 -MA construct indicate that there is no trimeric interface and it is solely a myristate-myristate mediated interaction. NMR structural studies of GCN 4 -MACA were precluded by broad linewidths possibly indicating a stronger CA trimeric interface. These findings lay the groundwork for the future study of Gag-Gag interactions necessary for assembly and the structural based design of HIV assembly inhibitors...|$|R
