40|$|Is {{sovereign}} debt {{so different from}} corporate debt {{that there is no}} need for bankruptcy procedures to handle potential defaults? The basic tools of finance seem to confirm that, without water-tight sovereign immunity, creditors face a Prisoner’s Dilemma: litiginous creditors may be tempted to grab what sovereign assets they can in a ‘race of the vultures’. Recent case history also suggests that there may be gains to ‘learning by suing’. To check this by a <b>standstill</b> <b>on</b> payments would doubtless run some risk of debtor’s moral hazard, as the Institute for International Finance have warned in their report on crisis resolution. But not to have an orderly procedure may mean that the IMF is de facto forced to bail out distressed members, leading to the risk of investors’ moral hazard, where investors lend without monitoring (secure in the belief that the international agencies will have to intervene). The strategic case for making legal a <b>standstill</b> <b>on</b> payments is to rescue the authorities from this ‘time consistent’ trap. international institutions; liquidity crises; Moral Hazard; Sovereign Borrowing; Time Consistency...|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} examines {{international trade}} {{and the role of}} the G 20. Key findings: 	If one of the main roles of the G 20 is to be a circuit breaker in overcoming intractable international economic issues, multilateral trade liberalisation is a prime candidate for the G 20 ’s attention. 	The record of the G 20 ’s <b>standstill</b> <b>on</b> protection is mixed, particularly when it comes to the application of non-tariff barriers. But the G 20 ’s record in helping to advance the conclusion of the Doha Round is poor. This has damaged the G 20 ’s credibility on trade policy. 	Countries are withdrawing from ambitious attempts to open world markets in favour of pursuing preferential trade arrangements, particularly mega-regional agreements. This should be a concern for the G 20. 	Trade policy needs to adapt to the reality that value chains are increasingly driving international trade. Goods are now made ‘in the world’. 	There are a number of things the G 20 could do to support the multilateral trading system, including: putting trade at the heart of efforts to deliver economic and employment growth; extend and strengthen the <b>standstill</b> <b>on</b> protection; harvest what can be saved from the Doha Round; help bring the WTO trade policy agenda into the 21 st century; advance plurilateral agreements; and seek to progressively align the modalities in the proposed mega trade agreements.

Braking distance of a service stop under LZB control (0,5m/s²) from 250km/h is given as 4820m that of a fast braking (1,05m/s²) at 2300m. For braking all cars have disc brakes. Additionally, the power heads use regenerative brakes, the intermediate cars have electromagnetic track brakes. The power cars have spring-loaded parking brakes; intermediate cars use screw brakes for the same purpose. The bogies facilitate replacing the track brakes with eddy current brakes.|$|R

A retrospective analysis of 318 pulseless trauma patients revealed that the survival of pulseless traumatic arrest patients without sonographic cardiac activity is rare [68].

We analyse a tax <b>on</b> <b>price</b> with respect to efficiency and practical policy appeal. Using a tax <b>on</b> <b>price</b> in combination with ad valorem taxation {{it is possible to}} achieve the Ramsey solution. That is, the combination of the two taxes secures tax revenue in the least distortive way.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an intensi…cation in the debate {{on how best to}} manage and resolve {{international}} …nancial crises. Many of the proposals on the table envisage a temporary <b>standstill</b> <b>on</b> debt repayments by the country, together with mechanisms for binding-in private sector creditors. Here we explore welfare implications of some of these proposals in a hybrid liquidity/solvency model of crisis. We show how mechanisms designed to aid debt restructuring {{in the event of an}} insolvency crisis may have a direct impact on the likelihood of liquidity crises- though they are not su¢cient, by themselves, to eliminate fully the costs of liquidity crises. We also discuss some of the potential costs that adoption of a standstills-based regime might incur. ...|$|R
