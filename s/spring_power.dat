5000|$|At first, {{electromagnets}} {{controlled by}} analogue resistor/capacitor timers {{were used to}} govern {{the release of the}} second shutter curtain (though still operated by <b>spring</b> <b>power).</b> In 1979, the Yashica Contax 139 Quartz (Japan) introduced more precise digital piezoelectric quartz (shortly followed by ceramic) oscillator circuits (ultimately under digital microprocessor control) to time and sequence its entire exposure cycle - including its vertical FP shutter. Electric [...] "coreless" [...] micromotors, with near instantaneous on/off capability and very high power for their size, would drive both curtains (and other camera systems), replacing springs altogether, in the late 1980s. Minimizing mechanical moving parts also helped to prevent inertial shock vibration problems.|$|E

50|$|Fire dampers can {{be found}} in the same places as smoke dampers, {{depending}} on the application of the area after the firewall. Unlike smoke dampers, they are not triggered by any electrical system (which is an advantage in case of an electrical failure where the smoke dampers would fail to close). Vertically mounted fire dampers are gravity operated, while horizontal fire dampers are spring powered. A fire damper's most important feature is a mechanical fusible link which is a piece of metal that will melt or break at a specified temperature. This allows the damper to close (either from gravity or <b>spring</b> <b>power),</b> effectively sealing the duct, containing the fire, and blocking the necessary air to burn.|$|E

50|$|Some {{pneumatic}} recoil buffers used in firearms are fast, low-power gas springs. When compressed, {{they present}} initial resistance as the rod-to-seal grip is broken {{and then they}} move in a regular manner. An additional small spring can be used inside the gas spring if rapid turnaround times are needed. Springs twist and the coils try to ride over each other when moving and this chaotic movement does not exist with gas springs, hence reducing twist and jump of the firearm. These features are very advantageous. Fine tuning of the <b>spring</b> <b>power</b> is also possible by altering the internal gas volume. This design for firearms was invented and patented by Collins and Shipman of Bedford, UK and Bergstrom in the U.S. in 2001.|$|E
40|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines, steam engines, air compressors, and so forth, the piston ring {{plays an important}} role. Especially, the recent development of Diesel engines which require a high compression pressure for their working, makes, nowadays, the packing action of the piston ring {{far more important than}} ever. Though a number of papers have been published in regard to researches on the problem of the piston ring, none has yet dealt with an exact measurement of pressure exerted on the cylinder wall at any given point of the ring. The only paper that can be traced on this subject so far is Mr. Nakagawa's report on the determination of the relative distribution of pressure on the cylinder wall, but the measuring method adopted therein appears to need further consideration. No exact idea has yet been obtained as to how the obturation of gas between the piston and cylinder, the frictional resistance of the piston, and the wear of the cylinder wall are affected by the intensity and the distribution of the radial pressure of the piston ring. Consequently, the author has endeavored, by employing an apparatus of his own invention, to get an exact determination of the pressure distribution of the piston ring. By means of a newly devised ring tester, to which piezoelectricity of quartz was applied, the distribution of the radial pressure of many sample rings on the market was accurately determined. Since many famous piston rings show very irregular pressure distribution, the author investigated and achieved a manufacturing process of the piston ring which will exert uniform pressure on the cylinder wall. Temperature effects on the configuration and on the mean <b>spring</b> <b>power</b> have also been studied. Further, the tests were performed to ascertain how the gas tightness of the piston ring may be affected by the number or <b>spring</b> <b>power.</b> The researches as to the frictional resistance between the piston ring and the cylinder wall were carried out, too. The procedure of study, and experiments conducted by the author, on this subject will be fully described in the following paragraphs...|$|E

As {{oil prices have}} continued to rise above expectation, analysts have scrambled to find explanations.

The author compares the current situation with that prevailing at the time of previous oil shocks and outlines some of the difficulties entailed in measuring the impact of sharp oil price increases on U. S. inflation and output.; The author concludes that increased energy efficiency, robust economic conditions, enhanced central bank credibility, and stable inflation expectations both here and abroad are likely to make the impact of recent energy price increases on the U. S. economy more muted and manageable than in previous oil shocks. Indeed, she writes, the current episode suggests that one of the rewards for establishing a low-inflation environment may be an improved ability to weather moderate supply shocks. Still, she points out, it's not too soon to hope for an early <b>spring.</b> <b>Power</b> resources - Prices...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{use of a}} needle-free {{injector}} (NFI) that inject drag solution {{into the}} skin by applying pressure is increasing {{with an increase in}} the number of diabetes patients. The medical treatment of diabetes involves insulin administration several times a day. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to improve the usability of the NFI and the development of the NFI that can be used for multiple injections with a one-time administration preparation. The existing the NFI inject the drag solution by the application of elastic force. The problem with these the NFI is the maintenance of a constant injection force each time that they are used, because the elastic force decreases with {{an increase in the number}} of injection times. We found that it is possible to assist the injection force by generating an impact force at the time of injection. Therefore, the impact clearance is set in the NFI. Certain experiments have been carried out to investigate the relationship between the impact clearance and injection force. The results of these experiments reveal that the injection force is maintained at a constant value by increasing the impact clearance when the <b>spring</b> <b>power</b> decreases. A trial model of the multiple-injecting the NFI is developed on the basis of these results. It is evaluated under the condition that a constant injection force is maintained even in the case of multiple injections. 1...|$|E
40|$|Obama-onsen (Obama Hot Spring) {{is located}} at the western seaside on the Shimabara Peninsula, {{southwest}} Japan. There are approximately 30 spring sources along a 1500 -m stretch of the seaside that produce about 14, 500 tons of hot water per day at a temperature around 100 °C. Although Obama-onsen is one of the highest-producing hot spring areas of Japan in terms of both heat quantity and temperature, about 70 % of the hot water is thought to be untapped. Moreover, the thermal energy of the hot water is never exhausted, because almost all of the water is used only for bathing. 　Beginning in 2007, we held discussions on binary power generation using untapped hot water, among local governments, industry, and local communities. In March 2011, the Obama-onsen promotion conference for utilizing geothermal energy was organized formally by these members. The purpose of the conference was to research the utilization of untapped hot water and to create a new business model for“ local production for local consumption” of energy. Also, the conference had a goal of developing geotourism for environmental education. 　It is estimated that the untapped hot water and waste heat at Obama-onsen have the power generation capacity of about 2, 000 kilowatts. In the winter of 2012, a demonstration plant of hot <b>spring</b> <b>power</b> generation with an output capacity of 210 kilowatts will be installed, supported by a subsidy provided by the Ministry of the Environment.
