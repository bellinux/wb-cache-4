5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in many cases. These are usually due to a <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae. Scientists found that a certain scleractinian zooxanthella is becoming more common where sea temperature is high. Symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly, implying an evolutionary trade-off.|$|E

40|$|Using demand shifts {{induced by}} demographics, we {{evaluate}} capital budgeting and market timing.

To the extent that demographic <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> the distant future are not incorporated into equity prices, market timing implies that industries anticipating positive demand <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> the distant future should issue less equity due to undervaluation. The evidence supports both theories: new listings and equity issuance respond positively to demand shifts during {{the next five years}} and negatively to demand <b>shifts</b> further <b>in</b> the future...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the issue of}} population growth and its impacts on employment change at a regional level. Specifically it addresses the question: What are the associations between <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> population share and <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> employment share across regional Australia and are we witnessing <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> employment associated with the widely observed <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> population to the so-called sun-belt states? It attempts {{to answer this question}} by up-dating an earlier analysis using newly formed spatial units - functional economic regions (FERS) - and recent census data. It finds that while there is some broad aggregate associations between population growth and employment growth, once a sectoral analysis is undertaken, the linear association between population and employment changes is less clear-cut.
