Results show that the transition angles for the water wedge cases are within 5. 3 % and 9. 2 %, for simulations and experiments respectively, compared to results obtained with the theoretical detachment criterion for solid surfaces. Triple point trajectory angles are measured and compared with analytic solutions, agreement within 1. 3 ◦ is shown for the water wedge cases.

40|$|Abstract: The {{inspection}} of cooling circuit components of French pressurized water reactors is mainly performed with contact ultrasonic transducers. The surfaces of components involve that {{the shapes of}} the <b>solid</b> <b>wedges</b> are not matched to the irregular surface or to the shape of components (butt weld, nozzle, elbow). This mismatch creates an irregular coupling layer between the wedge and the local surface, and can lead to beam distortions and losses of sensitivity. These two phenomena contribute to reduce the inspection performances. To improve such controls, a new concept of contact “smart phased array transducer ” has been developed {{with the support of the}} French safety authorities (IRSN). The phased array is flexible to fit the complex profile and to minimize the thickness of the coupling layer. The independent piezoelectric elements composing the radiating surface are mechanically assembled in order to build an articulated structure. A profilometer, embedded in the transducer, allows to compute in real-time the optimised delay laws to compensate the distortions of 2 D or 3 D profiles. Those delay laws are transferred to the real-time UT acquisition system, which applies them to the piezoelectric elements. This self-adaptive process preserves, during the scanning, the features of the focused beam (orientation and focal depth) in the specimen. Two prototypes are presented and inspections of realistic irregular profiles of 2 D and 3 D geometry mock-ups, including artificial flaws, have been carried out, to estimate the enhancement performances of the "smar...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{developed}} a 3 D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical scheme to reproduce the transport of rigid bodies in free surface flows (e. g. floods, surface waves). It {{is based on the}} Euler-Newton equations for body dynamics, implemented through the SPH formalism. This scheme has been coupled to a Weakly Compressible (WC) -SPH model for the main flow, based on the semi-analytic approach (Di Monaco et al. 2011). The SPH boundary treatment of Adami et al. (2012) has been implemented and adapted to free-slip conditions to model the "fluid-solid body" coupling terms. On the other hand, the "solid-solid" ("body-body" and "body-frontier") interactions are represented by the "boundary force particles" of Monaghan (2005). This technique has been implemented by introducing some modifications to represent the impingements of entire bodies (not only isolated particles), even at low velocities. The new model has been validated on a sequence of 2 D and 3 D test cases. They involve preliminary tests both with single and multiple bodies and frontiers, four water entries of falling <b>solid</b> <b>wedges,</b> and the propagation of a 3 D dam break front. This is driven by the regular lift of a mobile gate, transports a floating body (6 degrees of freedom) and impacts two fixed obstacles and several solid frontiers. This last phenomenon has also been experimentally realized during this study. Validation refers to comparisons vs. measurements, Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) results, other SPH models, analytical and theoretical solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Modern uses of rotating shafts depend upon bearing speeds and temperatures that exceed normal operating parameters. In order to accommodate these excessive parameters, magnetic bearings have replaced ball or thrust bearings. However, eddy currents cause a loss of power and instability in magnetic bearings. The eddy current magnitude is responsible for the power loss, while the phase lag between the magnetic field and the input or control current causes the instability. This study incorporated finite element studies of magnetic thrust bearings using static bench testing procedures to investigate configurations that promote eddy current reduction.
