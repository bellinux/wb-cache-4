40|$|The {{basic problem}} of main {{pipelines}} non-destructive examination is {{reliability and validity}} of obtained parameters of flaws (including <b>stress-corrosion</b> <b>cracks).</b> One of the most rapid and efficient NDT techniques for main pipelines is the method of magnetic flux leak (MFL) over defect. In accordance with magnetic method canon- the examination reliability (that is probability of crack detection starting from some preset threshold level) is a multiparameter task. The MFL technique is widely used for detection of internal and external stress-corrosion. The instruments implementing MFL method provide magnetization of pipeline wall material up to the technical saturation level; after that the magnetic filed flux leak is registered by magnetic field sensors. Stress-corrosion and corrosion like defects present in the pipeline wall are detected based on information picked up from those sensors. The difficulty in this case is the fact that basic measured parameter is subjected to impacts of numerous factors including material sensitivity towards magnetization, types of sensors and there location, pipeline wall thickness, the gap between pipeline surface and measuring element, etc. The magnetic instruments, as a rule, comprise: magnetic module inducing magnetic field in the pipeline wall; sensors placed between magnets at certain distance from each other. If it is required to evaluate the depth of the <b>stress-corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> the number of sensors and distance between them should be determined. Also it is necessary to evaluate and determine the distance between neighboring <b>stress-corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> making it possible to differentiate them. In the paper posed is the problem and discussed are approaches of its solution, i. e. how to define the sufficient number of sensors to detect peak signal amplitude that can be correlated to the depth of <b>stress-corrosion</b> <b>crack</b> and how to determine minimal distances between cracks for which the last ones can be differentiated.

Specimens were sensitized using controlled furnace heat treatments and the degree of sensitization was measured by the electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (EPR) method. Active loading tests were performed on standard specimens over a range of intensities. Crack lengths were determined by compilance measurements using in-situ high-temperature clip gage or LVDT methods, optical metallography on the side faces of the specimen, and fractography of the cracked surface after completion of the tests. The optical metallography measurements did not provide useful estimates of crack lengths, because large variations in IGSCC propagation across the thickness of the specimens occurred. The effects of the degree of sensitization on the IGSCC propagation rate are obscured by the data scatter. However, it seems clear that these variables do not lead to order-of-magnitude changes in the crack propagation rate...|$|R

5000|$|Superaustenitic {{stainless}} steels, such as Allegheny Ludlum alloy AL-6XN and 254SMO, exhibit great {{resistance to}} chloride pitting and crevice corrosion {{because of high}} molybdenum content (>6%) and nitrogen additions, and the higher nickel content ensures better resistance to <b>stress-corrosion</b> <b>cracking</b> versus the 300 series. The higher alloy content of superaustenitic steels makes them more expensive. Other steels can offer similar performance at lower cost and are preferred in certain applications. For example ASTM A387 is used in pressure vessels but is a low-alloy carbon steel with a chromium content of 0.5% to 9%. Low-carbon versions, for example 316L or 304L, are used to avoid corrosion problems caused by welding. Grade 316LVM is preferred where biocompatibility is required (such as body implants and piercings).

The experimental results concluded the undersizing trend of PAUT in detecting the last crack tip or closure, in spite of using dynamic depth focusing, and/or focusing on crack tip. The average undersizing error is – 0. 4 mm. This error increases for cracks with depth> 12 mm.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{magnetic}} flux leakage (MFL) is widely used for examination of pipeline wall to detect {{the presence of internal}} and external stress-corrosion. Magnetic scanner in which the MFL method is realized provides the pipe wall material magnetization, after magnetization the MFL is registered by magnetic field sensors. The stress-corrosion defects present in the pipeline wall are detected based on information picked up by the sensors. The main problem of defects parameters estimation is the fact that basic measured parameter is subjected to influence of numerous factors including: pipe material respond on magnetization, type of sensor, their placement scheme, pipe wall thickness and gap between measuring elements and pipe surface, etc. The scheme of examination implemented in the magnetic scanners comprises magnetic module which create the magnetic field in the pipeline wall. Between magnets located are sensors mounted with preset step. To solve the task of stress-corrosion damage depth evaluation it is required to determine the number of required sensors and distance at which they should be positioned between magnets.

50|$|In true {{corrosion}} fatigue, the fatigue-crack-growth rate {{is enhanced}} by corrosion; this effect is seen in all three regions of the fatigue-crack growth-rate diagram. The diagram {{on the left is}} a schematic of crack-growth rate under true corrosion fatigue; the curve shifts to a lower stress-intensity-factor range in the corrosive environment. The threshold is lower (and the crack-growth velocities higher) at all stress-intensity factors. Specimen fracture occurs when the stress-intensity-factor range is equal to the applicable threshold-stress-intensity factor for <b>stress-corrosion</b> <b>cracking.</b> When attempting to analyze the effects of corrosion fatigue on crack growth in a particular, both corrosion type and fatigue load levels affect crack growth in varying degrees. Common types of corrosion include filiform, pitting, exfoliation, intergranular; each will affect crack growth in a particular material in a distinct way. For instance, pitting will often be the most damaging type of corrosion, degrading a material's performance (by increasing the crack-growth rate) more than any other kind of corrosion; even pits of the order of a material's grain size may substantially degrade a material. The degree to which corrosion affects crack-growth rates also depends on fatigue-load levels; for instance, corrosion can cause a greater increase in crack-growth rates at a low loads than it does at a high load.|$|E

40|$|Mechanisms {{controlling}} {{environmental degradation}} and cracking in light-water-reactor (LWR) {{systems have been}} investigated by analytical transmission electron microscopy (ATEM) of cracks and crack tips. The current work focuses on intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) of 300 -series, austenitic stainless steels in high-temperature LWR environments. Comparisons are made between cold-worked 304 SS containing <b>stress-corrosion</b> <b>cracks</b> produced in a simulated boiling-water-reactor (BWR) environment during crack-growth tests, and a 304 SS core component with cracks produced during 26 -year BWR service. Similar corrosion products consisting of duplex-layered spinel oxides were found along the walls of open cracks in the service and laboratory test samples. These oxide films consisted of oriented Cr-rich spinel up to ~ 30 nm thick along the metal crack walls and large-grained Fe-rich spinel at the crack centers. Cracks in the service sample were generally more filled with oxide, perhaps reflecting the much longer times available for corrosion to occur after the crack passage. Crack tips in the BWR top-guide sample exhibited unique and unexpected structures with oxide-filled cracks < 10 nm wide ending in finger-like attack and locally “dealloyed ” zones of Fe/Cr-depleted, Ni-rich metal. Alloy compositions measured at numerous crack tips were 40 wt% Fe, 4 wt % Cr and 55 wt % Ni immediately ahead of the degradation front versus approximately 70 wt % Fe, 19 wt % Cr and 9 wt% Ni in the bulk 304 SS. Laboratory samples with cracks grown over much shorted times (~ 1. 5 months) did not show the distinctive crack tip structures or strong Ni enrichment in the metal ahead of the crack tips as for the service sample. This suggests that although selective oxidation processes occur during degradation, significant composition differences may only develop after crack propagation has slowed or stopped.
