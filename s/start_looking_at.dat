500|$|The Hall of Fame {{has been}} criticized for {{inducting}} several lacklustre candidates in the early 2000s decade due to [...] "a shortage of true greatness". Since then, some have claimed that the Hall of Fame has become too exclusive. The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for failing to induct international players and critics have claimed that the Hall has been far too focused on the National Hockey League. A common statement is that it is more of an [...] "NHL Hall of Fame" [...] than a general Hockey Hall of Fame. Partially in response to these claims, the Hall of Fame opened an International Hockey exhibit and announced that it would <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> more international players for induction. Valeri Kharlamov was inducted in 2005, {{and is one of the}} few modern-day inductees to never play in the NHL. The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for overlooking World Hockey Association players and over representing the Original Six era from 1942 to 1967. For several years, the Hall of Fame was criticized for overlooking female hockey players before the Hall of Fame announced that women would be given separate consideration. In 2010, Angela James and Cammi Granato were the first women to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.|$|E
2500|$|George Stephanopoulos asked Obama on {{television}} in early January what kind of dog they would get, and when, {{saying that he was}} passing on a question from Obama's daughters who were sitting in the control room. Obama said, [...] "They seem to have narrowed it down to a labradoodle or a Portuguese water hound ... medium-sized dog, and so, we're now going to <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> shelters to see when one of those dogs might come up." [...] Much was made by the public and press about the family's search for a dog. On April 12, 2009, it was announced that the Obamas would soon accept a six-month-old Portuguese Water Dog puppy as a gift from Senator Kennedy. The dog was reported to have visited the family some weeks earlier in a secret meeting to gauge compatibility and purportedly referred to by staffers as [...] "The Meeting". However, the gift was not accepted until the dog officially arrived and moved in at the White House on Tuesday, April 14, 2009. Immediately after he arrived, the family staged a photo op with Bo on the property's South Lawn. At the conference, Obama was asked if he would allow Bo inside the Oval Office, to which he responded: [...] "of course." [...] He also gave a nod to President Harry Truman's quote, [...] "If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog." [...] The White House website was later updated to include official pictures and biographical details of Bo.|$|E
