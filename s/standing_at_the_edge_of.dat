500|$|On {{her first}} {{televised}} performance of [...] "White Horse", on November 23, 2008, at the 2008 American Music Awards, Swift donned a white evening gown {{as she sat}} on floral-patterned couch. While promoting the song, she later performed it at the Nomination Concert for the 51st Grammy Awards, where she coupled it in a medley with a cover of Brenda Lee's [...] "I'm Sorry", and the AOL Sessions. Since, Swift has performed the track at the Studio 330 Sessions, the 2009 CMA Music Festival, the 2009 V Festival, and on Dancing with the Stars. Swift performed [...] "White Horse" [...] on all venues in 2009 and 2010 of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour. During the performances, Swift wore a pastel sundress as performed solely playing an acoustic guitar, <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the stage's runway. In the concert on May 22, 2009, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, Swift sang [...] "White Horse" [...] in duet with American singer John Mayer. Reviewing the June 2, 2010 concert at Verizon Center in Washington, D.C., Dave McKenna of The Washington Post reported, [...] "On 'White Horse,' the chorus of believers also joined in, and threw their young fists {{in the air to}} yell Swift's esteem-free but cathartic climax, 'I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well!'" [...] Swift said in a 2012 interview with Cosmopolitan that White Horse is in fact her favorite song to sing live, [...] "a song that I've always been proud of because it's about that really horrible feeling of a one-sided relationship that isn't balanced; it's one-sided. You clearly love him more than he loves you, and you know it. And it's a sinking feeling, but it's also a really intoxicating feeling. And a lot of times girls will end up in these relationships where he's not giving you anything so you'll take the crumbs. In my mind what hurts the most is what they didn't say. It's when they knew I needed to hear something and they wouldn't just say it. They knew I needed commitment or loyalty or reassurance, and they wouldn't give it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1867 Roebling started {{design work}} {{on what is}} now called the Brooklyn Bridge, {{spanning}} the East River in New York. On June 28, 1869 at Fulton Ferry, while he was <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a dock, working on fixing the location where the bridge would be built, his foot was crushed by an arriving ferry. His injured toes were amputated. He refused further medical treatment and wanted to cure his foot by [...] "water therapy" [...] (continuous pouring of water over the wound). His condition deteriorated. He died on July 22, 1869 of tetanus at the home of his son on Hicks Street, in Brooklyn Heights. It was just 24 days after the accident. Roebling is buried in the Riverview Cemetery in Trenton, New Jersey.|$|E

60|$|So {{the time}} passed by, {{and with each}} year Wildrose grew taller and more {{beautiful}}, and she lived happily in her nest and never {{wanted to go out}} of it, only <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> in <b>the</b> sunset, and looking upon the beautiful world.

60|$|Princess Ozma {{considered}} the situation gravely. Then she tied her handkerchief to her wand and, <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> water's <b>edge,</b> waved <b>the</b> handkerchief like a flag, as a signal. For a time they could observe no response.|$|R

50|$|The {{songs from}} Lily Sleeps gained some {{industry}} attention and Casey signed a publishing contract with Rondor Music Publishing in 1997. It {{was during this}} time that Casey began recording Whirlwind Medusa. This is also when the first recordings of future favorites Hollow and House of Jupiter were completed. In 1999 Casey was informed that his contract with Rondor Music Publishing would not be renewed. This led to a dark period in the performer's life. In the summer of 2000 Stratton moved to Chicago where he began a nearly two-year hiatus from the record industry. He immersed himself in writing and recorded an independent album called The Winter Children. Many of these tracks would be re-recorded later and included on his Sony release <b>Standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Edge.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Vyner, slept on.

6000|$|I strolled {{into the}} pine-wood.

Suddenly I came on Pearse <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the cliff with Pasiance sitting in a little hollow below, looking up at him. I heard him say: ...|$|E

5000|$|After <b>Standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Edge,</b> Stratton gained further success {{when the}} Junior Vasquez remix of [...] "House Of Jupiter" [...] went to #1 on the Billboard Dance chart, and {{remained}} there for 20 weeks in 2005.

60|$|From {{the spot}} where they were now <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the ravine the ground sloped very steeply up for some {{hundreds}} of feet, and then steep crags rose in an unbroken wall; but from the view they had had of the country {{from the other side}} they knew that behind this wall rose a range of lofty summits.

60|$|The {{speakers}} were <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> {{the water}} {{in front of the}} Palace of St. Mark.

60|$|He {{remained}} <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the pit {{that the}} Thing {{had made for}} itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some evidence of design in its arrival. The early morning was wonderfully still, and the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already warm. He did not remember hearing any birds that morning, there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the faint movements from within the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on the common.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{break-up}} of the band, Hawley {{has enjoyed a}} successful solo career.

40|$|In 8 experiments, {{the authors}} {{examined}} {{the use of}} representations of self-to-object or object-to-object spatial relations during locomotion. Participants learned geometrically regular or irregular layouts of objects while <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> or in <b>the</b> middle and then pointed to objects while blindfolded in 3 conditions: before turning (baseline), after rotating 240 degrees (updating), and after disorientation (disorientation). The internal consistency of pointing in the disorientation condition was equivalent {{to that in the}} updating condition when participants learned the regular layout. The internal consistency of pointing was disrupted by disorientation when participants learned the irregular layout. However, when participants who learned the regular layout were instructed to use self-to-object spatial relations, the effect of disorientation on pointing consistency appeared. When participants who learned <b>the</b> irregular layout <b>at</b> <b>the</b> periphery of the layout were instructed to use object-to-object spatial relations, the effect of disorientation disappeared. These results suggest that people represent both self-to-object and object-to-object spatial relations and primarily use object-to-object spatial representation in a regular layout and self-to-object spatial representation in an irregular layout.
