40|$|Abstract Background Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDAII), {{the most}} common form of CDA, is an {{autosomal}} recessive condition. CDAII diagnosis is based on invasive, expensive, and time consuming tests that are available only in specialized laboratories. The recent identification of <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> mutations as the cause of CDAII opens new possibilities for the molecular diagnosis of the disease. The aim of this study was to characterize molecular genomic <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> defects in 16 unrelated patients affected by CDAII and correlate the identified genetic alterations with <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> transcript and protein levels in erythroid precursors. Methods <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> was sequenced in 16 patients, their relatives and 100 control participants. <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> transcript level were studied by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in peripheral erythroid precursors and lymphocytes from the patients and healthy control participants. <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>B</b> protein content was analyzed by immunoblotting in samples of erythroblast cells from CDAII patients and healthy controls. Results All of the investigated cases carried <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> mutations on both alleles, with the exception of two patients in which a single heterozygous mutation was found. We identified 15 different <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> mutations, of which four represent novel mutations: p. Gln 214 Stop, p. Thr 485 Ala, p. Val 637 Gly, and p. Ser 727 Phe. The CDAII patients exhibited a 40 - 60 % decrease of <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> mRNA levels in erythroid precursors when compared with the corresponding cell type from healthy participants. The largest decrease was observed in compound heterozygote patients with missense/nonsense mutations. In three patients, <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>B</b> protein levels were evaluated in erythroid precursors and found to be strictly correlated with the reduction observed at the transcript level. We also demonstrate that <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>B</b> mRNA expression levels in lymphocytes and erythroblasts are similar. Conclusions In this study, we identified four novel <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> mutations associated with CDAII disease. We also demonstrate that the genetic alteration results in a significant decrease of <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> transcript in erythroid precursors. Similar down-regulation was observed in peripheral lymphocytes, suggesting that the use of these cells might be sufficient in the identification of <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>B</b> gene alterations. Finally, we demonstrate that decreased <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>B</b> protein levels in erythroid precursors correlate with down-regulation of the <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> mRNA transcript. </p...|$|R

40|$|Sec 16 plays a {{key role}} in the {{formation}} of coat protein II vesicles, which mediate protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. Mammals have two Sec 16 isoforms: Sec 16 A, which is a longer primary ortholog of yeast Sec 16, and <b>Sec</b> 16 <b>B,</b> which is a shorter distant ortholog. Previous studies have shown that <b>Sec</b> 16 <b>B,</b> as well as Sec 16 A, defines ER exit sites, where coat protein II vesicles are formed in mammalian cells. Here, we reveal an unexpected role of <b>Sec</b> 16 <b>B</b> in the biogenesis of mammalian peroxisomes. When overexpressed, <b>Sec</b> 16 <b>B</b> was targeted to the entire ER, whereas Sec 16 A was mostly cytosolic. Concomitant with the overexpression of <b>Sec</b> 16 <b>B,</b> peroxisomal membrane biogenesis factors peroxin 3 (Pex 3) and Pex 16 were redistributed from peroxisomes to Sec 16 B-positive ER membranes. Knockdown of <b>Sec</b> 16 <b>B</b> but not <b>Sec</b> 16 A by RNAi affected the morphology of peroxisomes, inhibited the transport of Pex 16 from the ER to peroxisomes, and suppressed expression of Pex 3.

In this thesis, I explore the phenotypes of gene targeted mice deficient for the mouse SEC 23 orthologs Sec 23 a and <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>b.</b> Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDAII) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by mild to severe anemia, and recently reported to be due to mutations in the <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> gene. Mice homozygous for a gene trap insertion in the last intron of the mouse <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>b</b> gene (<b>Sec</b> 23 <b>b</b> gt/gt) were demonstrated to exhibit massive pancreatic degeneration and die within a day of birth, with no evidence of anemia on blood analysis. Chimeric mice generated by transplantation of <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>b</b> gt/gt hematopoietic precursor cells into wild type mice demonstrated full reconstitution of erythropoiesis, as well as other blood cell lineages. Mass spectrometry analysis of <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>b</b> gt/gt RBC ghosts prepared from chimeric mice using a comparative SILAC approach detected no proteins that were quantitatively decreased compared to control RBC ghosts. These results suggest divergence in tissue-specific <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> function between mice and humans. Humans with mutations in SEC 23 A are affected with Cranio-Lenticulo-Sutural Dysplasia (CLSD), which is characterized by late closure of the cranial fontanelles and mild mental retardation. Mice with a gene trap insertion in the second intron of the Sec 23 a gene die between day 10. 5 and 11. 5 of embryogenesis. Mice heterozygous for both the Sec 23 a gt and <b>Sec</b> 23 <b>b</b> gt alleles (<b>Sec</b> 23 a+/gt Sec 23 b+/gt) are viable and fertile with no apparent pathologic phenotype.

40|$|Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs) are phenotypically and genotypically {{heterogeneous}} diseases 1 – 4. CDA type II (CDAII) is {{the most}} frequent CDA.

Cowden syndrome (CS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by high lifetime risks of epithelial cancers, such that ∼ 50 % of affected individuals are wild-type for known cancer-predisposing genes. Using whole-exome and Sanger sequencing of a multi-generation CS family affected by thyroid and other cancers, we identified a pathogenic missense heterozygous <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> variant (c. 1781 T>G [p.

We also found germline heterozygous <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> variants in 3 / 96 (3 %) unrelated mutation-negative CS probands with thyroid cancer and in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), representing apparently sporadic cancers. We {{note that the}} TCGA thyroid cancer dataset is enriched with unique germline deleterious <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> variants {{associated with}} a significantly younger age of onset. <b>SEC</b> 23 <b>B</b> encodes <b>Sec</b> 23 homolog <b>B</b> (S.  cerevisiae), a component of coat protein complex II (COPII), which transports proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus.
