2500|$|Despite the Spanish-language term bloqueo ({{blockade}}), {{there has}} been no physical, naval blockade of the country by the United States after the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.

2500|$|In 2003, Charles Taylor, {{the former}} {{president}} of Liberia, was served with an arrest warrant by the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) that was set up under the auspices of a treaty that binds only the United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone. Taylor contested the Special Court's jurisdiction, claiming immunity, but the Special Court for Sierra Leone concluded in 2004 that [...] "the <b>sovereign</b> <b>equality</b> of states does not prevent a head of state from being prosecuted before an international criminal tribunal or court". The Special Court convicted Taylor in 2012 and sentenced him to fifty years' imprisonment, making him the first head of state since the Nuremberg Trials after World War II to be tried and convicted by an international court. In sum, the question whether a former head of state might have immunity depends on which international court or tribunal endeavors to try him, how the court is constituted, and how it interprets its own mandate.|$|E
40|$|While the {{government}} presents the MSC as {{the embodiment of}} the future, structurally it bears remarkable resemblance to the colonial legal orders. The enclave nature of the MSC is reminiscent of the colonial dual legal orders. At the same time, the international legal and economic orders have undergone profound changes. The international legal order is now premised on <b>sovereign</b> absolutism and <b>equality</b> among nation-states. The reigning economic paradigm is high technology rather than manufacturing or the spice trade. Discussion of the continuities and discontinuities between colonial and present day transnational legal orders must thus attend to a number of variables. Further, to the extent possible, rhetoric must be distinguished from practice...|$|R
60|$|I {{have heard}} the {{question}} argued--On what terms should a man of inferior rank live {{with those who are}} manifestly superior to him? If a marquis or an earl honour me, who have no rank, with his intimacy, am I in my intercourse with him to remember our close acquaintance or his high rank? I have always said that where the difference in position is quite marked, the overtures to intimacy should always come from the higher rank; but if the intimacy be ever fixed, then that rank should be held of no account. It seems to me that intimate friendship admits of no standing but that of equality. I cannot be the Sovereign's friend, nor probably the friend of many very much beneath the <b>Sovereign,</b> because such <b>equality</b> is impossible.|$|R

It excites the reader to independent thought on each matter considered and tempts him to write a book of his own in order to do better if he can. This is high praise; and it should be remembered as this review proceeds, inasmuch as the reviewer is forced to fill most of his permitted space with a discussion of differences of option.

Just as Marx developed a critique of equilibrium economics by claiming that this was only one ‚Äòmode of production‚Äô, which had been preceded and would be followed by others, Van der Pijl in this project challenges the ‚ÄòIR‚Äô paradigm.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the {{question}} of how to proceed with plans for economic integration received considerable discussion in specialized journals and at international meetings of experts. Disillusioned by traditional instruments and concerned with the need to decentralize planning and management in their domestic economies, the reformers argued for the strengthening of market relations among Comecon states. The conservatives continued to stress the importance of planned approaches. If carried to a logical extreme, the latter would involve supranational planning of major aspects of members' economies and the inevitable loss of national autonomy over domestic investment policy.

50|$|Functional {{immunity}} {{arises from}} {{customary international law}} and treaty law and confers immunities on those performing acts of state (usually a foreign official).

Thus, it {{is a type of}} immunity limited in the acts to which it attaches (acts of state) but ends only if the state itself ceases to exist. The immunity, though applied to the acts of individuals, is an attribute of a state, and {{it is based on the}} mutual respect of states for <b>sovereign</b> <b>equality</b> and state dignity.

50|$|On May 29, 1972, it was {{implied in}} an {{agreement}} between Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev, that the Brezhnev Doctrine was to be repealed from the Soviets‚Äô agenda. This was made possible because the Doctrine allegedly violated the <b>sovereign</b> <b>equality</b> of the socialist states {{that they were trying}} to manage. As the meeting between both political figures went on, the USSR accepted the agreement believing that the United States was planning to repeal the Monroe Doctrine. This section of the Moscow Declarations, explained that as long as one country remained in accordance with the removal of their own explorational doctrine, then the other must abide as well. However, if that agreement was infringed upon, then the other country withheld the right to come back to their own doctrine, and enforce it as such. This was a sigh of relief for both the Middle East and other regions that fell victim to the Brezhnev Doctrine, and Latin America. Latin Americans rejoiced as that meant they were free of situations like the incident that happened in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{criticism}} {{argues that}} humanitarian intervention has historically consisted of primarily actions directed by so-called Northern states within {{the internal affairs}} of so-called Southern states, and has also led to criticism from many non-Western states. These critics argue that the norm of non-intervention and the primacy of <b>sovereign</b> <b>equality</b> is something still cherished by the vast majority of states, which see humanitarian intervention not as a growing awareness of human rights, but a regression to the selective adherence to sovereignty of the pre-UN Charter world. During the Havana G-77 summit in 2000, the [...] "so-called right of humanitarian intervention" [...] as it was described, was condemned as having no basis in international law. Furthermore, in his criticism, Chomsky writes that [...] "Humanitarian interventionism goes only one way - from the powerful to the weak", and condemns what he called the targeting of the concept of national sovereignty by humanitarian interventionists, arguing that the primary purpose of national sovereignty is to give weak states partial protection against strong states, and that the protection of national sovereignty under international law stops internal conflicts in weak countries being exploited by strong ones.|$|E
5000|$|... "When {{the contest}} is only with native rulers, {{and with such}} native {{strength}} as those rulers can enlist in their defence, the answer I should give {{to the question of}} the legitimacy of intervention is, as a general rule, No. The reason is, that there can seldom be anything approaching to assurance that intervention, even if successful, would be for the good of the people themselves. The only test possessing any real value, of a people‚Äôs having become fit for popular institutions, is that they, or a sufficient portion of them to prevail in the contest, are willing to brave labour and danger for their liberation. I know all that may be said, I know it may be urged that the virtues of freemen cannot be learnt in the school of slavery, and that if a people are not fit for freedom, to have any chance of becoming so they must first be free. And this would be conclusive, if the intervention recommended would really give them freedom. But the evil is, that if they have not sufficient love of liberty to be able to wrest it from merely domestic oppressors, the liberty which is bestowed on them by other hands than their own, will have nothing real, nothing permanent. No people ever was and remained free, but because it was determined to be so...."Mill's argument for humanitarian intervention, however, is not compatible with modern international law. International law after World War II establishes the principle of <b>sovereign</b> <b>equality,</b> and therefore to subject a sovereign state to outside intervention is generally considered illegal. To deal with this potential conflict between humanitarian intervention and the international legal system, there are some philosophical attempts to conciliate the two concepts and specify conditions for ethically justified interventions. John Rawls, one of the most influential political philosophers of the twentieth century, offers his theory of humanitarian intervention based on the notion of [...] "well-ordered society." [...] According to Rawls, a well-ordered society should be peaceful and legitimate, and it must respect basic human rights. Between such well-ordered societies, the principle of non-intervention should uphold. On the other hand, expansionist or human rights violating regimes are not shielded from the international law: in grave cases such as ethnic cleansing, coercive intervention by others is legitimate.|$|E

In this Article, Professor Lee examines the historical and normative foundations of <b>sovereign</b> <b>equality,</b> finds them wanting under the condition of a militarily supreme republican state, but defends the norm on the pragmatic ground of {{what is best for the}} supreme state to defend itself against covert, non-state actors with potential access to weapons of mass destruction. <b>Sovereign</b> <b>equality</b> is very useful because the domestic institutions in a democratic state constrain effective monitoring and response to this category of threat. Treating other states, from which the supreme state might obtain intelligence or cooperation (by coercion if necessary) in combating the principal threat axis, as equals, is an efficacious substitute for the failure of domestic institutions to contain the covert, non-state threat...|$|E
