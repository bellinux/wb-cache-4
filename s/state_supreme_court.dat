40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to answer what causes dissent in <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts.</b> It also approaches the normative questions of whether dissent in <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> {{is good or}} bad for democracy. Within I review relevant literature on <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts,</b> judicial voting behavior and dissent. I also conduct my own study of <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts.</b> I find that limited resources affect nonconsensual opinion writing on <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts.</b> I do this by creating an OLS regression model showing that the employment of law clerks causes more nonconsensual opinions and a larger caseload causes less nonconsensual opinion writing. I also find that more dissent is consistent with the democratic tradition, as it enables more voices to be heard...|$|R

5|$|The Appellate Division of the New York <b>State</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> {{ruled that}} NYSDOT had {{to provide a}} new {{environmental}} report by May12, 1989 or face having the reconstruction shut down. The order by the court reversed {{a decision by the}} New York <b>State</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> that determined that a revised report was unnecessary. Residents of Westbury claimed that the project would bring noise concerns to the village, along with a spillover of diverted traffic to local roads. Concerns were also stated by then-mayor Ernest Strada about Westbury's water supply and potential impacts from the project. NYSDOT claimed that no disruption would be caused by the project, but Strada insisted there were still concerns. Strada also stated that the village had no interest in shutting down the project; rather, they wanted to ensure that their community would be protected from any disruptions caused by the reconstruction. On April24, NYSDOT announced they had appealed the stoppage of work on the interchange, which had been suspended pending a ruling by the Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{judicial}} {{branch is}} made up of several levels. The <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>court,</b> with four justices and a chief justice, is the highest court in the state. Below the supreme court are the circuit courts; 41 circuit judges serve in seven judicial circuits in the state. Below the circuit courts are the magistrate courts, which deal with more minor criminal and civil actions.|$|E

5|$|The 1951 charter reforms {{included}} {{consolidation of}} {{city and county}} offices. When all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County were consolidated into one city in 1854, the surviving county offices often duplicated the efforts of city offices. The new charter allowed for their consolidation, but litigation ensued about which county offices were actually state offices, and thus immune from the city's jurisdiction. A <b>State</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> case decided in 1953 settled the issue, for the most part, leaving the Register of Wills as an independently elected official.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{works in}} concert with the state legislature (the bicameral Indiana General Assembly, consisting of the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate) and the <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>court</b> (the Supreme Court of Indiana) to govern the state. The governor has the power to veto legislation passed by the General Assembly. If vetoed, a bill is returned to the General Assembly for reconsideration. Unlike other states, most of which require a two-thirds supermajority to override a veto, the Indiana General Assembly may override the veto with an absolute majority vote in both chambers.|$|E

In 2010 the New York <b>State</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> dismissed a lawsuit against Fordham brought by the Alfred Condominium Complex. The suit was filed in response to the University's expansion plans at Lincoln Center and their expected visual and auditory impact on the surrounding community.

50|$|Although the Confederate <b>States</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> {{was never}} constituted, the <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> {{of the various}} Confederate states issued {{numerous}} decisions interpreting the Confederate Constitution. Unsurprisingly, given that the Confederate Constitution {{was based on the}} United States Constitution, the Confederate <b>State</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Courts</b> often used United <b>States</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> precedents. The jurisprudence of the Marshall Court, thus, influenced the interpretation of the Confederate Constitution. The state courts repeatedly upheld robust powers of the Confederate Congress, especially on matters of military necessity.|$|R

5|$|A {{coalition}} {{of civil rights}} groups began a court challenge of the bill in Indiana state courts, and the Daniels' administration defended {{the government in the}} case. The Indiana Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state in late 2007. The petitioners appealed the bill to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and that body upheld the <b>State</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> decision in the case of Crawford v. Marion County Election Board. Upon appeal the United States Supreme Court also ruled in favor of the state in April 2008, setting a legal precedent. Several other states subsequently enacted similar laws in the years following.|$|E

Absentee ballots mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted. The deadline for overseas (including military) ballots was extended to April 13 after the United States Department of Justice sued the state to ensure {{they would have a}} reasonable chance of being counted.

5|$|Oklahoma's {{judicial}} branch {{consists of}} the Oklahoma Supreme Court, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, and 77 District Courts that each serve one county.

Judges of those two courts, {{as well as the}} Court of Civil Appeals are appointed by the Governor upon the recommendation of the state Judicial Nominating Commission, and are subject to a non-partisan retention vote on a six-year rotating schedule.|$|E

5|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{attorney}} general, White {{was in charge of}} several important lawsuits, among the most prominent being the state's pursuit of tax liabilities from railroad companies. Prior to his election as attorney general, railroads had never paid taxes in the state of West Virginia. White instituted proceedings to tax all the railroads within the state. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company obtained an injunction against the levying of the taxes, leading to a judicial test case. White argued the case first in the lower courts, and then before the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, which ruled in White's favor. The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the ruling of the <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>court,</b> which compelled the railroads to pay taxes to the state.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{is one of}} {{only two}} states (along with Wisconsin) that {{classify}} DUI as a traffic violation, and not a criminal offense, except in cases of serious injury or death. Because it is not a criminal offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do {{not have the right to}} a jury trial, DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC criminal database, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the <b>state</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{an appeals}} court, the Oregon Supreme Court {{is also the}} court of last resort in Oregon.

Decisions of the court are published in the Oregon Reporter published by the Oregon Judicial Department. The Territorial Supreme Court was created in 1848 when the Oregon Territory was formed {{out of the old}} Oregon Country region, followed by the creation of the <b>State</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> in 1859 when Oregon was admitted to the Union on February 14.|$|E
