40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis on}} Possibilities of <b>sheeps</b> <b>milk</b> {{in the food}} industry, is a literature review dealing with the possibilities of using <b>sheeps</b> <b>milk,</b> its composition and its differences from the milk of other animals, its processing capabilities in the food industry {{and its impact on}} human health. The bachelor thesis is divided into two parts. First, the general section discusses the domestication history of sheep breeding and diseases in sheep breeding. This part has its important especially because without domestication there would be no posibility of using milk, because only health animal, both physically and mentally, can provide benefit and production, which we expect from it. The second part deals with the milk and its processing. Its hows the two dairy breeds of sheep and the effect of the breed for milk production. Further, the composition of sheep's milk is disclosed and compared with the composition of the milk of other animals whose milk is used in the food industry. In this thesis, states that the composition of <b>sheeps</b> <b>milk</b> is only with few exceptions no different from cows or goats milk. The diference is primarily in the concentration which at <b>sheeps</b> <b>milk</b> can be doubledin some parameters. Further more, the thesis deals with the processing of milk into cheese, yogurt and other fermented dairy products, their method of processing and the use of lactic cultures. Finally, the work deals with the influences of consumption of milk, cheese and fermented dairy products on human health...|$|E

Please {{look for}} {{up-to-date}} {{information in the}} OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] are approximately 6. 14 million sheep in the United States (NASS 2005); however, only approximately 11, 000 are dairy ewes (Thomas 2004). In 2003, the estimated U. S. <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> production was 1. 2 – 1. 8 million kg, most of which was used for cheese production (Thomas 2004). Cow and goat milk cheeses have been produced in Oregon for decades. No <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> cheese is currently produced in Oregon, although <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> cheeses are popular around the world. <b>Sheep</b> <b>milk</b> cheeses originated primarily in countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.

40|$|The optimum {{conditions}} {{for the production of}} coprecipitate from <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> were studied. The best percentage of calcium chloride added to milk was 0. 2 %, which resulted in a recovery of 97. 5 % of milk proteins. At low pH (4. 5 – 5), the recovery of protein was low, but it increased at higher pH values (5. 5 – 6. 5); recovery was greatest at pH 6. 5. The optimum heating temperature to obtain coprecipitate from <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> was 85 – 95 °C. The functional properties of the <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> coprecipitate were studied. At pH values higher than 6, there were no differences between the solubility of <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> coprecipitate and <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> sodium caseinate, but the solubility of coprecipitate at pH values lower than 5 was relatively higher than those of the caseinate. At pH ≥ 6, the emulsion activity index (EAI) for emulsions of <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> coprecipitate and caseinate increased as pH increased; at all pH values, the EAI of the coprecipitate was higher than that of the caseinate. <b>Sheep</b> <b>milk</b> coprecipitate showed higher foaming ability and stability than <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> sodium caseinate...|$|R
50|$|<b>Sheep</b> <b>milk</b> is {{extremely}} {{high in fat}} and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) compared to other milk producing species. There is also {{a large amount of}} solids present in the <b>milk.</b> This makes <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> an excellent choice for making cheese and it produces higher yields of cheese compared to other milk producing species. One liter of <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> will produce a far higher amount of cheese than one liter of cow milk.|$|R
500|$|Though <b>sheep's</b> <b>milk</b> may {{be drunk}} rarely in fresh form, {{today it is}} used {{predominantly}} in cheese and yogurt making. Sheep have only two teats, and produce a far smaller volume of milk than cows. However, as <b>sheep's</b> <b>milk</b> contains far more fat, solids, and minerals than cow's milk, it is ideal for the cheese-making process. It also resists contamination during cooling better because of its much higher calcium content. [...] Well-known cheeses made from <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> include the Feta of Bulgaria and Greece, Roquefort of France, Manchego from Spain, the Pecorino Romano (the Italian word for sheep is pecore) and Ricotta of Italy. Yogurts, especially some forms of strained yogurt, may also be made from <b>sheep</b> <b>milk.</b> Many of these products are now often made with cow's milk, especially when produced outside their country of origin. <b>Sheep</b> <b>milk</b> contains 4.8% lactose, which may affect those who are intolerant.|$|R
40|$|Milk {{is nearly}} {{complete}} food and contains all the essential components in nearly balanced form. In the present study, the milk of four different species like goat, cow, buffalo and <b>sheep</b> <b>milk,</b> was analyzed compositionally and {{results showed that}} the cow milk have highest LR and specific gravity i. e., 30. 0 and 1. 03, respectively than other three species i. e. buffalo, goat and <b>sheep.</b> The cow <b>milk</b> showed maximum pH value (6. 65) while <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> samples showed maximum titratable acidity (0. 181 %). The minimum pH value (6. 58) was of <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> while the minimum titratable acidity (0. 15 %) was of the cow milk samples. The results of fat (%) showed that buffalo, cow, goat milk are non-significantly different from each other but <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> is significantly different from other three species. However, the results of SNF found in this study showed significant difference (P< 0. 05) among the milk of buffalo (8. 79 %) and of goat milk (8. 92 %). In contrast, the SNF of milk samples obtained from cow and sheep (9. 17 and 9. 71 %, respectively). The {{results showed that the}} <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> had the good range (5. 32 - 7. 74 %) of protein and the highest average protein contents (6. 57 %).

The chemical 499 ºC for 12 min, then cooled to composition and microbiological characteristics were determined at day 1, 3, 7 and 10. The results showed that goat milk treated by charcoal had higher protein, lactose and SNF contents, then the milk treated with microwave had higher fat and TS contents.

40|$|Annual world <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> {{production}} {{is estimated at}} the level of 8. 2 million tons and constitutes 1. 5 % of the total milk production obtained from various species of mammals. Majority of this milk is used to manufacture cheeses and fermented beverages. These products are commonly considered as regional articles and are protected by legal regulations which guarantee their taste and aroma typical for a given region and which they owe to traditional production technologies. In Poland, sheep are reared, primarily, in mountainous areas (Podhale, Bieszczady) but also in Wielkopolska and Podlasie. The sheep population in Poland is estimated at 223   000 animals but milk is obtained only from a small number of animals and its annual {{production is}} assessed {{at the level of}} 1000 t.
