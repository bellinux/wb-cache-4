Design In this observational study, changes in outcome measures were monitored with habituation to caging. Continuous focal observations of the activity, location in the cage, and posture were conducted from video recordings for one 24 -hour period/week/cat. Cat-Stress-Scores were recorded daily. All faecal samples were collected for analysis of FGM. Results: The percentage time spent eating increased, while percentage time spent grooming decreased, from week 1 to week 2. Cat-Stress-Score declined significantly from week 1 to week 2. FGM concentrations were significantly greater in week 1 than in week 5. A posthabituation time budget of the behaviour of the cats in the <b>single</b> <b>cages</b> showed that inactivity dominated the time budget and the cats were located on the shelf {{almost half of the}} time.

40|$|Posterior lumbar interbody fusion {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} {{as one of the}} surgical procedure to treat clinical problems. However, vertebral endplate subsidence failure has been detected as one of its major problems that might increase the potential of pain and mechanical instability. Therefore, posterior instrumentation (PI) has been introduced alongside with double fusion cages implant to limit segmental movement and to facilitate fusion. Nevertheless, the use of two interbody fusion cages will be likely to incur higher cost and more risky. Hence, <b>single</b> oblique <b>cage</b> insertion surgical procedure has been reported as one of the reliable solution. In the present study, an image-based finite element analysis was used to evaluate a subsidence phenomenon based on the fracture risks evaluation and the stress profiles at cage-endplate interface in two different cage insertion orientations namely as double <b>cages</b> and <b>single</b> oblique <b>cage.</b> Apparently, the <b>single</b> oblique inserted <b>cage</b> with PI has significantly produced lower stress than the double inserted cages at the cage-endplate interfaces. At higher impact loading (2000 N), the total number of compressive deformations of the double <b>cages</b> outnumbered the <b>single</b> oblique <b>cage</b> at the cage-endplate interface junctions and the deformations were more uniformly distributed. Obviously, there was a trade-off between the stress generation, the implant stability and the risk of vertebral bone failures.

The cage can only be damaged on the side which has a green padlock. Most of the cages are hidden away in secret passages, so once the Electoons are free, they will create a portal which leads to the outside of these passages. Each level contains a medallion that shows how many Electoon challenges the players completed, such as break a <b>single</b> <b>cage,</b> collect a specific amount of Lums or beat the clock whilst the level has been completed. In every level there are hidden cages ranging from 1 to 3.

Scoring high marks in either of these challenges can also earn medals and trophies. Players can also unlock special 'treasure chest' levels, in which they must chase a runaway treasure chest across a dangerous course in order to receive a skull tooth.

The study investigated the clinical and radiological outcomes of MIS-TLIF using the unilateral approach and <b>single</b> <b>cage</b> in the patients over 65 years of age. Methods. Thirty-eight patients were followed for a mean of 15. 5 ± 11. 61 months. Radiological data include fusion rate, change of disc height, and central canal area. The numeric rating scale (NRS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were used to assess clinical outcomes. Results. The mean age of these patients at operation was 71. 82 ± 4. 71 years (range, 65 – 82 years). Evidence of fusion was observed radiologically in 64. 71 % at 6 months and 87. 5 % at 12 months after surgery, giving a final fusion rate of 100 %. The mean NRS scores for back and leg pain and ODI scores improved significantly at the final follow-up. Conclusions.

A total of 2289 records (line A) and 2596 records (line D) from single cages, 518 and 541 records (for line A and D, respectively) from group cages, were analysed. (Co) variance components of <b>single</b> <b>cage</b> data were analysed using the programme VCE 4 applying the REML method and a multiple trait animal model. An EM-algorithm was used to obtain (co) variance components for group cage data. Genetic correlations between single and group cages were analysed using the programme VCE 4 based on sire model. Heritability estimates for monthly egg production in single cages ranged from 0. 08 to 0. 44 (line A); 0. 04 to 0. 43 (line D) and those for group cages were 0. 02 to 0. 42 (line A); 0. 02 to 0. 19 (line D). Egg weight was highly heritable for single and group cages (heritability = 0. 25 to 0. 54).

40|$|Several studies {{support a}} {{serotonin}} {{role in the}} physiological control of bone mass. However, whether serotonin (5 -HT) is involved in bone loss due to reduced mechanical stress or unloading is unknown. We investigated the effects of reduced 5 -HT tone, induced by tryptophan-free diet, in movement-restraint osteopenia induced by housing mature rats, acclimatised in <b>single</b> <b>cages</b> with a floor area of 1, 500 cm(2), in smaller size <b>single</b> <b>cages</b> where their motor activity was reduced. Tryptophan-deficiency significantly worsened movement-restraint-induced bone loss in both femoral metaphysis and diaphysis (DXA analysis) but not at lumbar vertebrae and impaired the mechanical properties of the femur by significantly reducing both cortical thickness and strength strain index (pQCT analysis). Such effects resulted from an impairment of bone turnover with bone resorption exceeding bone formation. Tryptophan-supplemented diet reversed the worsening effects of tryptophan-deficiency on movement-restraint osteopenia. The improvements of both bone mass and strength were associated with an increase of serum osteocalcin and IGF-I, markers of osteoblast activity. In vitro studies in primary cultures of rat osteoblasts suggest that the anabolic action of 5 -HT involves the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Serotonin significantly increased the cytoplasmatic β-catenin protein levels by the inhibition of the enzyme glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β, that by phosphorylating β-catenin promotes its degradation. Our data support a role for 5 -HT in the anabolic response of the appendicular skeleton to mechanical loading. We suggest that serotonin might stimulate canonical Wnt/β-catenin-dependent bone formation to occur...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{retrospectively}} {{evaluated the}} clinical and radiological outcomes of posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with using a unilateral <b>single</b> <b>cage</b> {{and a local}} morselized bone graft. Methods: Fifty three patients who underwent PLIF with a unilateral <b>single</b> <b>cage</b> filled with local morselized bone graft were enrolled in this study. The average follow-up duration was 31. 1 months. The clinical outcomes were evaluated with using the visual analogue scale (VAS) at the pre-operative period, at 1 year post-operation and at the last follow-up, the Oswestry Disability Index, the Prolo scale and the Kim & Kim criteria at the last follow-up; the radiological outcomes were evaluated according to the change of bone bridging, the radiolucency, the instablity and the disc height. Results: For the clinical evaluation, the VAS pain index, the Oswestry Disability Index, the Prolo scale and the Kim & Kim criteria showed excellent outcomes. For the the radiological evaluation, 52 cases showed complete bone union at the last follow-up. Regarding the complications, only 1 patient had cage breakage during follow-up.

40|$|Functional {{recovery}} after cerebral ischemia may {{be enhanced}} by activation of the noradrenergic system and by environmental enrichment. The underlying mechanisms have remained elusive, but endogenous neurogenesis and perilesional angiogenesis have been speculated {{to contribute to the}} behavioral improvement. To address this question, neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and perilesional angiogenesis (RECA- 1) were correlated with behavioral performance in forty Wistar rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham-operation. Atipamezole, an ? 2 -adrenoreceptor antagonist (1 mg/kg, i. p.), was administered for 10 days together with housing of rats in an enriched environment.
