He left Microsoft in 2002 to co-found, with business partner Gregor Kiczales, a company called Intentional Software. This company markets the intentional programming concepts Simonyi developed at Microsoft Research. In this approach to software, a programmer first builds a language environment specific to a given problem domain (such as life insurance). Domain experts, aided by the programmer, then describe the program's intended behavior in a What You <b>See</b> <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Get</b> (WYSIWYG)-like manner. An automated system uses the program description and the language to generate the final program. Successive changes are only done at the WYSIWYG level.|$|E
500|$|BBC America {{described}} Gilly {{on their}} official website stating: [...] "His most endearing quality is his honesty {{and despite his}} countless flaws, what you <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get.</b> He's hardly a ladykiller but what he lacks in appearance he makes up for with charisma." [...] E4 publicity describe Gilly as fun-loving and always trying to woo females but hardly manages to impress them and has also been described as unlucky-in-love after his failed relationships. Initially he failed to impress females and didn't {{have much in common}} with them. Gilly has been portrayed as a strong supporter of Manchester City F.C., it was this single thing that drew him and Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan) together. Gilly was later made a fool by Beth and his best friend Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) after they continued an affair despite the fact they were siblings, they split, Beth subsequently died and due to Gilly's forgiving personality he later forgave Rhys. Holy Soap opined that this was a stand out moment of the character's duration. Another storyline showing his timid personality was when he was mugged by a group of teenagers and was left fearing for his safety and even let them pick on him on the streets. In a further twist Gilly was left feeling so ashamed of the attack he pretended it was adult attackers fearing what people would think of him.|$|E

5000|$|LyX (styled as ''''''; {{pronounced}} [...] ) is an {{open source}} document processor based {{on top of the}} LaTeX typesetting system. Unlike most word processors, which follow the WYSIWYG ("what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> get") paradigm, LyX has a WYSIWYM ("what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean") approach, where what shows up on the screen is only an approximation of what will show up on the page.|$|R
2500|$|Other early word-processing {{software}} required users to memorize semi-mnemonic key combinations rather than pressing keys labelled [...] "copy" [...] or [...] "bold". (In fact, many early PCs lacked cursor keys; WordStar famously used the E-S-D-X-centered [...] "diamond" [...] for cursor navigation, and modern vi-like editors encourage use of hjkl for navigation.) However, the price differences between dedicated word processors and general-purpose PCs, {{and the value}} added to the latter by software such as VisiCalc, were so compelling that personal computers and word processing software soon became serious competition for the dedicated machines. Word processing became the most popular use for personal computers, and unlike the spreadsheet (dominated by Lotus 1-2-3) and database (dBase) markets, WordPerfect, XyWrite, Microsoft Word, , {{and dozens of other}} word processing software brands competed in the 1980s; PC Magazine reviewed 57 different programs in one January 1986 issue. Development of higher-resolution monitors allowed them to provide limited WYSIWYG—What You <b>See</b> <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Get,</b> to the extent that typographical features like bold and italics, indentation, justification and margins were approximated on screen.|$|E

40|$|Quantum {{decoherence}} {{in all its}} {{locus of}} essence, and expression {{is the loss of}} coherence or ordering of the phase angles between the components of a system in a quantum superposition. Detrimental ramifications, and pernicious implications of this dephasing leads to classical or probabilistically additive behavior. Quantum decoherence gives the appearance of wave function collapse (the reduction of the physical possibilities into a single possibility as seen by an observer. Here it is to be noted that perception is not the reality and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> not <b>what</b> <b>you</b> see;what <b>you</b> do not <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do not see; <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do not see;and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do not <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see.)</b> … Thus in all its wide ranging manifestations, it justifies the propositional subsistence and corporeal reality that justifies the framework and intuition of classical physics as an acceptable approximation: decoherence is the mechanism by which the classical limit emerges out of a perceptual field of quantum starting point and it determines the location of the quantum-classical boundary. Decoherence occurs when a system interacts with its environment in a thermodynamically irreversible way. This prevents transitive states, substantive sub states an...|$|R
