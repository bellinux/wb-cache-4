40|$|Application of the {{molecular}} genetic methods in forensic cases dealing with wild animals has significantly increased recently. These techniques are practically used {{in order to}} help solving four key problems : determination of kind of the wild animal, geographic origin, kinship ties and individual identification. In this work the first case of introducing the examination of polimorphism of microsatelite genetic markers within forensic analysis in the cases of poaching in Serbia is presented. The objectives of this forensic analysis was to determine if the meat confiscated during house search of the suspect comes from roebuck origin (Capreolus capreolus), which remains had been found by a game warden in the field during closed season, where the suspect denied the offense, claiming that the meat comes from other roebuck that had been shot during the previous hunting season. DNK was isolated from the skin and fur samples taken from the roebuck corpse found in the woods, {{as well as from the}} frozen meat found in the <b>suspect’s</b> <b>house.</b> Both amplification and polimorphism examination of the eight microsatelite markers (ROE 01, NVHRT 21, NVHRT 24, NVHRT 48, NVHRT 73, RT 7 AND RT 27) were carried out. In all the examined samples, the same pattern of variability of the tested microsatelites was determined, that is it was proved that DNK profiles of the samples taken from roebuck corpse were identical to DNK profile of the meat sample found in the <b>suspect’s</b> <b>house.</b> This result clearly indicates that all the examined biological samples originate from the same animal, and consequently represents forensically valid evidence in the case of roebuck poaching.

Such fears have taken on many incarnations over the past five years, focusing first on wealth declines due to the stock price crash in 2001, concern over foreigners’ appetite for U.
