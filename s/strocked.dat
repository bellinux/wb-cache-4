However, the first {{residents}} were William <b>Strock</b> and his family. <b>Strock</b> was born June 12, 1801 to Joseph <b>Strock</b> and Betsy Bensinger <b>Strock</b> in Tyrone Township, Pennsylvania. <b>Strock's</b> entire family migrated to Austintown in 1813 or 1815. The <b>Strocks</b> settled {{in the southern part}} of Austintown township near the Smiths Corner area. William became a carpenter and married Lydia Crum. The couple had three children, two of whom died as infants. In 1830, <b>Strock</b> bought 87 acre of land in Great Lot 8, Township 2, Range 3 of the Western Reserve from John Jordan and had McClure build the house there.|$|R

5000|$|In 1851, <b>Strock</b> {{sold the}} house and the {{accompanying}} 108 acre to Francis Henry. Henry was active in the Restoration (reformed Baptist) movement. The <b>Strock</b> Stone house was reputedly a stop on the Underground Railroad that smuggled fugitive slaves to safety in Canada. This claim has yet to be proven, but some evidence appears to support it. Austintown was listed in Galbreath's History of Ohio as part of the path of the Underground Railroad that included [...] "Salineville, New Lisbon, Canfield, Austintown, Edinburgh, Warren, Bloomfield, Rome, Lenox, Austinburg, Ashtabula Harbor." [...] William <b>Strock's</b> brother, John Henry <b>Strock,</b> was described {{as one of the first}} abolitionists in Mahoning County. Additionally, Francis Henry appears on William Seibert's 1898 list of known underground railroad operators in Mahoning County. Finally, Heffelfinger's unpublished History of Meander says that slaves were hidden in a tunnel that connected the house basement with the barn. Henry lived in the <b>Strock</b> Stone house with his wife, Mary, and their four children[...]|$|R

5000|$|<b>Strock's</b> {{coverage}} of the Battle of Buna-Gona was initially published by Life on February 15 and 22, 1943, within a month of the battle's conclusion on January 22.
