2500|$|In 1995, Josef Joffe, a {{research}} fellow at the Hoover Institution, reviewed Sowell's Race and Culture: A World View for Commentary magazine, saying [...] "Thomas Sowell's work is a relentless, 331-page attack against the wisdom of the day, which comes under the frazzled labels of 'multiculturalism,' 'PC,' and 'affirmative action'; but the argument takes place on a breathtaking intellectual level that ought to command the respect even of those who violently disagree with him." [...] In reviewing the same book for the American Political Science Review, [...] political scientist Richard Coughlin was more critical, saying that [...] "In general, Sowell's attempt to build a case for the independent role played by culture works better in some areas than in others. The effort to expand the examination of race/ethnicity beyond one national setting is laudable, and the coverage of a literature drawn from several disciplines is impressive. But the absence of a coherent (much less, rigorous) comparative methodology renders the analysis less compelling than it might otherwise be. Sowell's approach is to adduce various examples drawn from one or more nations, cultures, or time periods in support of his argument. This approach is the weakest of the comparative methodologies, since it does not lend itself to negative findings. Nowhere does Sowell acknowledge the extensive comparative methods literature in [...] "so-called 'social science'," [...] nor does he provide a rationale for his selection of specific cases (i.e., a <b>sampling</b> <b>design,</b> however rudimentary). This ad hoc treatment of empirical evidence will not trouble those predisposed to agree with Sowell's blend of social conservative and laissez-faire economics ideology. But the book's lack of methodological rigor will, I suspect, make it easy for readers holding opposing viewpoints to discount Sowell's conclusions." ...|$|E

This paper considers estimation of the disparate treatment parameter when the sample is stratified jointly by loan outcome and race covariate. We use Monte Carlo analysis to investigate the finite-sample properties of two estimators of the disparate treatment parameter under six stratified <b>sampling</b> <b>designs</b> and three data generating processes; one estimator is consistent irrespective of <b>sample</b> <b>design</b> while the other is not. Unfortunately the inconsistent estimator is employed inadvertently in fair lending studies. We demonstrate the gains in using the consistent estimator {{as well as providing}} recommendations on <b>sample</b> <b>design.</b> We also study the effect of <b>sample</b> <b>design</b> on the empirical power of a test for statistical significance of the disparate treatment parameter. We recommend adopting a <b>sample</b> <b>design</b> that approximately balances by outcome and racial group, when using the estimator that adjusts for the stratification scheme. However, if the standard logit estimator is employed, then our results suggest a <b>sample</b> <b>design</b> that balances by outcome and allocates across racial groups proportionally to the population.

Brewer and Hanif (1983) provided a summary of these <b>sampling</b> <b>designs.</b> The maximum entropy designs is one of them. Consistency results have been proven for the maximum entropy sampling (Hájek, 1964). The aim is to give sufficient conditions under which Hájek (1964) consistency results still hold for large entropy <b>sampling</b> <b>designs</b> which {{are different from the}} maximum entropy design. These conditions involve modes of convergence of <b>sampling</b> <b>designs</b> towards the maximum entropy design.
