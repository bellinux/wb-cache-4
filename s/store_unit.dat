50|$|The POWER9 core {{comes in}} two variants, one is four-way {{multithreading}} called SMT4 and one eight-way called SMT8. The SMT4- and SMT8-cores are quite similar, {{in that they}} consist {{of a number of}} so-called slices fed by common schedulers. A slice is a rudimentary 64-bit single threaded processing core with load <b>store</b> <b>unit</b> (LSU), integer unit (ALU) and a vector scalar unit (VSU, doing SIMD and floating point). A super-slice is the combination of two slices. An SMT4-core consists of a 32 KB L1 cache, a 32 KB L1 data cache, an instruction fetch unit (IFU) and an instruction sequencing unit (ISU) which feeds two super-slices. An SMT8-core has two sets of L1 caches and, IFUs and ISUs to feed four super-slices. The result is that the 12-core and 24-core versions of POWER9 each consist of the same amount of slices, i.e. 96 each and the same amount of L1 cache.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{register}} file served {{an integer}} unit and a load <b>store</b> <b>unit,</b> and the register file and its two units {{are referred to}} as a [...] "cluster". The two clusters were designated U0 and U1. This scheme was used as it reduced the number of write and read ports required to serve operands and receive results, thus reducing the physical size of the register file, enabling the microprocessor to operate at higher clock frequencies. Writes to any of the register files thus have to be synchronized, which required a clock cycle to complete, negatively impacting performance by one percent. The reduction of performance resulting from the synchronization was compensated in two ways. Firstly, the higher clock frequency achievable offset the loss. Secondly, the logic responsible for instruction issue avoided creating situations where the register file had to be synchronized by issuing instructions that were not dependent on data held in other register file where possible.|$|E

50|$|The {{cells of}} the SA node are spread out within a mesh of {{connective}} tissue, containing nerves, blood vessels, collagen and fat. Immediately surrounding the SA node cells, are paranodal cells. These cells have structures intermediate between that of the SA node cells {{and the rest of}} the atrium. The connective tissue, along with the paranodal cells insulate the SA node from the rest of the atrium preventing the electrical activity of the atrial cells from affecting the SA node cells. The SA node cells are smaller and paler than the surrounding atrial cells, with the average cell being around 8micrometers in diameter, and 20-30 micrometers in length (1 micrometer= 0.000001 meter). Unlike the atrial cells, SA node cells contain fewer mitochondria (the power plant of the cell), have fewer myofibers (contractile machinery of the cell) and a smaller sarcoplasmic reticulum (calcium <b>store</b> <b>unit,</b> that releases calcium for contraction). This means that the SA node cells are less equipped to contract, compared to the atrial and ventricular cells.|$|E
50|$|In February 2009, it was {{announced}} that the BHS department store chain, also owned by the Greens, would be integrated into Arcadia. As part of the changes, some administrative functions previously run separately were intended to be consolidated to improve efficiency, and some BHS retail stores were to begin to carry Arcadia brands as concessions, enabling Arcadia to expand the presence of its brands without having to lease large numbers of new stores, and allow the firm to cut store costs by moving some operations from stand-alone stores into BHS locations. In The Mall Bexleyheath, the firm was able to introduce Wallis to the retail portfolio without having to lease a separate <b>store</b> <b>unit</b> to do so, and was also able to close the existing Evans store and relocate its operations into BHS. Meanwhile, at Lakeside Shopping Centre in Thurrock, Essex, the existing two-floor BHS was replanned to a reformatted single-level store to allow Topshop/Topman to relocate from their prior site (itself earlier expanded into the neighbouring ex-Etam premises) to take up what was previously the upper level of BHS. (The previous Topshop/Topman space was itself used to introduce Forever 21 to the centre).|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the REBUS project (Competitive Solar Heating Systems for Residential Buildings) a new concept of solar combisystem was developed. The system consisted of two units, the Technical Unit and the Solar <b>Store</b> <b>Unit.</b> The Solar <b>Store</b> <b>Unit</b> in principle is a buffer tank filled with space heating water, which needs 5 connections at the right heights for charging and discharging. For this Solar <b>Store</b> <b>Unit</b> in principle any simple available tank can be used because all operational devices are integrated in the Technical Unit. The proposed standard tank has a volume of 300 lt and it is integrated in a 60 x 60 cm cabinet with a nice casing, which is perfect for aesthetical integration. The standard tank is insulated with PUR-foam, which is filled between the tank with a diameter of 500 mm and the 60 x 60 cm cabinet. In order to improve the performance of the solar combisystem, keeping the solar tank into the 60 x 60 cabinet a new combined insulation concept was used, which enabled to increase the diameter of the tank; using a 20 mm thick vacuum panels, which are integrated into the PUR foam, allowed to increase the diameter of the tank by 10 % (550 mm instead of 500 mm), which increased the volume by 20 %, from 300 lt to 360 lt. In this paper are presented detailed investigations on the heat loss coefficients of the two tanks measured from laboratory tests and a comparative system analysis using the two different tanks...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} use solar {{radiation}} as thermal energy source, heat storage equipments result necessary in each application where continuous supply is required, {{because of the}} natural unsteady intensity of radiation during the day. Thermal solar collectors are especially suitable for low temperature applications, since their efficiency decreases when an high inlet temperature of fluid flowing through them is established. On the other hand, low temperatures and low temperature gaps, above all, make very difficult to use traditional sensible heat <b>storing</b> <b>units</b> (water tanks), because of the very large amounts of material required. In this work, a traditional sensible heat storage system is compared with a latent heat <b>storing</b> <b>unit</b> based on phase change materials (PCMs). As a case study, a 840 m 3 greenhouse heating application was considered with an inside constant temperature of 18 °C. It {{is thought to be}} heated by using single layer plate thermal solar collectors as energy source. Inlet temperature of the collectors fluid (HTF) was fixed at 35 °C (little higher than melting temperature of PCMs) and a constant flux of 12 l/m 2 hour was established as technical usual value. At these conditions, 215 m 2 solar panels exposed surface resulted necessary. The sensible heat storage system considered here is a traditional water tank <b>storing</b> <b>unit</b> equipped with two pipe coils, respectively for heat exchanges with HTF from collectors and water flux for greenhouse heating. Available DT for heat exchange is estimated as the difference of minimum HTF temperature (in outlet from the collectors) and the required water temperature for greenhouse heating. The latent heat <b>storing</b> <b>unit</b> is instead a series of copper rectangular plate shells which a phase change material is filled in (Na 2 SO 4 ⋅ 10 H 2 O). Heat transfer fluids flow through thin channels between adjacent plates, so that a large heat exchange available surface is achieved. The developed computational model (Labview software) permits to superimpose heat exchanges daily curves between heat storing materials and heat transport fluids (for both of the fluids and the heat storing equipments) on the energy supply/demand ones, respectively calculated on the basis of greenhouse energy demand and solar collectors dimensions, characteristics and efficiency. In this manner, units design is achieved by changing thermal energy <b>storing</b> <b>units</b> dimensions, in order that the corresponding heat exchange curves coincide with the previously calculated ones. Successively, among all the possible configurations, the ones showing lower units volumes and less amount of storing materials are chosen as the optimal design solutions. It has been proven that PCMs materials are much more suitable for low temperature applications than sensible heat storing materials (water). In the case of water tank, an about 15. 8 m 3 total volume is required while for PCMs equipment the total volume of <b>storing</b> <b>unit</b> is reduced to about 2. 2 m 3, such as about seven times total volume less. Besides, according to the simplified and steady state model calculations, PCMs unit shows a better response to the hourly energy fluctuations of solar collectors and greenhouse demand than water tank unit. This is especially due to the high available exchange surface achieved in proposed arrangement...|$|R
