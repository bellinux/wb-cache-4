5|$|The <b>supposed</b> <b>author</b> of the chronicle, William Gregory, {{was born}} in Mildenhall, Suffolk. He married three times, and had two daughters. In London, he trained as a skinner, and sold luxury furs to the {{household}} of King Henry VI. He lived in the parish of St Mary Aldermary, and was alderman of Cordwainer ward from 1435 for twenty-six years. He became Sheriff and Mayor in this period. He left bequests to the Skinner's Company in his will.|$|E
5|$|Gregory's Chronicle, the Chronicle of London, or MS Edgerton 1995, is {{the name}} given to a fifteenth-century English chronicle. It {{takes its name from}} its <b>supposed</b> <b>author,</b> William Gregory, who started as a skinner in London. Greogory {{went on to become a}} London Alderman, Sheriff from 1436 to 1437, and {{eventually}} Mayor from 1450 to 1451. The name 'Gregory' for the manuscript is, however, merely a convenience, as its actual authorship is unknown. Indeed, since the chronicle spans the period 1189 to 1470, and William Gregory died in 1467, it is impossible for him to have composed it in its entirety. Other fifteenth-century authors have been proposed, ranging from a contemporary poet to an Ecclesiast, but since even the exact dates of its composition are also debated it has been impossible for historians to definitively attribute the authorship to any known individual.|$|E

25|$|The {{apocryphal}} History of Joseph the Carpenter, {{written in}} the 5th century and framed as a biography of Joseph dictated by Jesus, describes how Joseph, aged 90 (the Protoevangelium had not given Joseph a specific age), a widower with four sons and two daughters, is given charge of the twelve-year-old Mary, who then lives in his household raising his youngest son James the Less (the <b>supposed</b> <b>author</b> of the Protoevangelium) until she {{is ready to be}} married at age 14½. Joseph's death at the age of 111, attended by angels and asserting the perpetual virginity of Mary, takes up approximately half the story.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} of his extant works, {{known as}} Liber spectaculorum, {{was first published}} {{at the opening of}} the Colosseum in the reign of Titus. It relates to the theatrical performances given by him, but the book as it now stands was presented to the world in or about the first year of Domitian, i.e. about the year 81, by him. The favour of the emperor procured him the countenance of some of the worst creatures at the imperial courtamong them of the notorious Crispinus, and probably (certainly it is thrilling to consider) of Paris, the <b>supposed</b> <b>author</b> of Juvenal's exile, for whose monument Martial afterwards wrote a eulogistic epitaph. The two books, numbered by editors xiii. and xiv., and known by the names of Xenia and Apophoretainscriptions in two lines each for presentswere published at the Saturnalia of 84. In 86 he bore for the world the first two of the twelve books on which his pendulous and sterling reputation rests.|$|E

500|$|In her {{discussion}} of the Ecclesiastes of the Hebrew Bible, Jennifer Koosed, associate professor of Religion at Albright College, explains {{that there is no}} solid consensus among scholars as to whether true biographies or autobiographies existed in the ancient world. One of the major scholarly arguments against this theory is that the concept of individuality did not exist until the European Renaissance, prompting Koosed to write [...] "...thus autobiography is made a product of European civilization: Augustine begat Rosseau begat Henry Adams, and so on". Koosed asserts that the use of first-person [...] "I" [...] in ancient Egyptian commemorative funerary texts should not be taken literally since the <b>supposed</b> <b>author</b> is already dead. Funerary texts should be considered biographical instead of autobiographical. Koosed cautions that the term [...] "biography" [...] applied to such texts is problematic, since they also usually describe the deceased person's experiences of journeying through the afterlife.|$|E

In spite of its dubious attribution, the statue is a city Important Cultural Asset. The one in the middle is the statue said to have been made by Ennin, which also seems to go back only to the late Heian period and is a national Important Cultural Asset. The one on the right is the statue traditionally attributed to Genshin, which has been dated {{to the middle of the}} Kamakura period and is far too young to really be by him.

2500|$|It {{was during}} this time that Yeremyan shifted his focus to {{composing}} historical atlases: {{one of his most}} notable contributions was on the study of a seventh-century [...] "Ashkharatsuyts", where he {{spent a great deal of}} his energies in not only translating and researching the background behind the atlas but also on the <b>supposed</b> <b>author</b> of the work, Anania Shirakatsi. In 1963, his Armenia According to the Ashkharatsuyts was published, although Yeremyan would in subsequent years go on to revise some of the views, most notably coming to the conclusion that Anania Shirakatsi was its true author, that he had concluded in the work. He also contributed in writing several articles in the USSR Historical Atlas. Yeremyan was also one of the key advocates who pushed for the publication of the History of the Armenian People (Yerevan, 1971–1984, 8 volumes), authoring numerous articles on the origins of the Armenian people, the kingdom of Urartu, and on the social, economic, cultural and political structure of the Kingdom of Armenia. He would also go on to write numerous articles in the Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia.|$|E

Zvi felt so guilty for copying his book that he added his friend's stolen obituary as the last chapter, telling the publisher that including the obituary was conditional to printing the book, although doing so did not make sense with the plot.

Moreover, she explores some of the textual tensions that exist in the Pentateuch {{as a result of the}} theological tensions between these authors, or groups of authors. For Armstrong, this tension can be seen in, for example, the contrasting accounts of theophanies. The Jahwist (J) writes of very [...] "intimate" [...] encounters between Abraham and Yahweh, while the Elohist (E) [...] "prefers to distance the event and make the old legends less anthropomorphic." ...|$|R

As for the authorship question itself, James found {{it very hard to}} believe that the [...] "Stratford man" [...] wrote the plays and sonnets. But he had found it almost as difficult to believe in any of the other <b>supposed</b> <b>authors,</b> such as Sir Francis Bacon.

2500|$|In {{a rather}} {{different}} notice written in 1350, Ludolph of Sudheim, a parish priest from Westphalia, correctly {{refers to the}} Pyramids as sepulchers, and says [...] "these tombs are called by the natives Pharaoh's granaries." [...] Some twenty years earlier the German Dominican William of Boldensele had traveled about Egypt and left (1336) a very critical account of the notion: [...] "the simple people of the country say that these were Pharaoh's barns and granaries in which Joseph had the wheat kept {{in the time of}} the great famine mentioned in the Bible ... But this cannot be true at all, for no place for putting in the wheat can be found there, and there is in inside these columns no empty space where anything can be placed. [...] For from top to bottom they are closed and made entirely of huge stones well joined to one another—except that there is a very small door quite high above the ground and a very narrow and very dark little passage through which one descends there for a certain distance, but it is not all wide enough to put grain in, as those of the country say and believe." [...] The German knight's memoir would provide the framework, and many of the details, {{for one of the most}} popular books of the late Middle Ages, the Travels of John Mandeville (1356). [...] The <b>supposed</b> <b>author</b> most likely did not visit the locales in his narrative, and in the case of his account of the Pyramids, he actually reverses the conclusions and reasoning of William: [...] "these are Joseph’s Granaries, which he had made to store the wheat for hard times ... Some say that they are tombs of the great lords of antiquity, but that is not true, for the common word through the whole country near and far is that they are Joseph's Granaries, and they have it written thus in their chronicles. [...] On the other hand, if they were tombs, they would not be empty inside, nor would they have entrances for going inside, nor are tombs ever made of such a large size and such a height—which is why it is not to be believed that they are tombs." ...|$|E

Although most of the first volume is of minor literary importance, the second section which appeared in 1728 as The History of the Pyrates commenced with a life [...] "Of Captain Misson and His Crew," [...] one of Defoe's most remarkable and neglected works of fiction. In much the same manner {{and at the same time}} that John Gay was satirizing Walpole's government in The Beggar's Opera, Defoe began to use his pirates as a commentary on the injustice and hypocrisy of contemporary English society. Among Defoe's gallery of pirates are Captain White, who refused to rob from women and children; Captain Bellamy, the proletarian revolutionist; and captain North, whose sense of justice and honesty was a rebuke to the corruption of government under Walpole. But the fictional Captain Misson, the founder of a communist utopia, is by far the most original of these creations.|$|E
