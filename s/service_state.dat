25|$|Singaporean {{military}} colours of the Singapore Armed Forces {{are divided}} today into <b>Service</b> <b>State</b> Colours and Unit Regimental Colours. Until 1997 {{there were also}} Service Regimental Colours and Unit State Colours. The State Colours {{are similar to the}} Flag of Singapore but differ per service. But Regimental Colours are different, and they differ per unit or service arm (save for the flags of the Air Force and Navy that show their respective service colours instead and some SAF service-wide commands like the Military Police). Their common design is that of the regimental or command arms at the centre of the colour used. Both are gold fringed and are brought out on major occasions only.|$|E

500|$|In its {{tropical}} cyclone {{report on the}} hurricane, the National Hurricane Center only referred to the system as [...] "Unnamed Hurricane". The Natural Disaster Survey Report called the storm [...] "The Halloween Nor'easter of 1991". The [...] "perfect storm" [...] moniker was coined by author and journalist Sebastian Junger after a conversation with NWS Boston Deputy Meteorologist Robert Case in which Case described the convergence of weather conditions as being [...] "perfect" [...] {{for the formation of}} such a storm. [...] Other National Weather Service offices were tasked with issuing warnings for this storm in lieu of the typical NHC advisories. [...] The OPC posted warnings on the unnamed hurricane in its High Seas Forecasts. [...] The National Weather <b>Service</b> <b>State</b> Forecast Office in Boston issued Offshore Marine Forecasts for the storm. [...] Local NWS offices along the East coast covered the storm in their Coastal Waters Forecasts.|$|E
500|$|In 1978, the NHC's offices {{moved off}} campus to the IRE Financial Building. [...] The {{hurricane}} warning offices remained active past 1983. [...] Organizationally, the NHC left {{the aegis of}} the National Weather <b>Service</b> <b>State</b> Forecast Office in Miami in 1984, leaving the Southern Region and becoming its own national center, one of three in existence at that time. [...] In 1988, NHC added a 36-hour point to their forecast. [...] During the National Weather Service reorganization in the 1990s, the NHC was renamed the Tropical Prediction Center on October 1, 1995, and moved into a building on the campus of Florida International University. [...] The Hurricane Specialists were grouped as a separate NHC unit under the Tropical Prediction Center, separating themselves from the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch. [...] By 2001, tropical cyclone forecasts were extended from three to five days in advance, including forecast points for 96 and 120 hours. [...] On October 1, 2010, the Tropical Prediction Center was renamed the NHC, and the group formerly known as the NHC became known as the Hurricane Specialists Unit (HSU).|$|E
2500|$|The Secession Convention and Military Board {{fears of}} Arkansas troops being {{transferred}} {{east of the}} Mississippi quickly became a reality. Brigadier General William J. Hardee led his new brigade of Arkansas Troops on a short uneventful raid into Missouri, and then transferred the command east of the Mississippi to join {{what would become the}} Confederate Army of Tennessee. Arkansas soon found itself virtually defenseless. By insisting that all state troops have the right to approve their transfer to Confederate <b>service,</b> <b>state</b> authorities had effectively killed the chance of raising a large unified force in the state. Governor Rector's newspaper charged: [...] "The Confederate government has abandoned Arkansas to her fate." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{creation}} {{of some sort}} of typical or shared French culture or [...] "cultural identity", despite this vast heterogeneity, is the result of powerful internal forces [...] such as the French educational system, mandatory military <b>service,</b> <b>state</b> linguistic and cultural policies [...] and by profound historic events [...] such as the Franco-Prussian war and the two World Wars [...] which have forged a sense of national identity over the last 200 years. However, despite these unifying forces, France today still remains marked by social class and by important regional differences in culture (cuisine, dialect/accent, local traditions) that many fear will be unable to withstand contemporary social forces (depopulation of the countryside, immigration, centralization, market forces and the world economy).|$|E
2500|$|Brass bands, {{known as}} [...] "trubači" [...] (трубачи, the trumpeters) are {{extremely}} popular, especially in Central and Southern Serbia where Balkan Brass Band originated. The music has its tradition from the First Serbian Uprising. The trumpet {{was used as}} a military instrument to wake and gather soldiers and announce battles, the trumpet took on the role of entertainment during downtime, as soldiers used it to transpose popular folk songs. When the war ended and the soldiers returned to the rural life, the music entered civilian life and eventually became a music style, accompanying births, baptisms, weddings, slavas, farewell parties for those joining military <b>service,</b> <b>state</b> and church festivals, harvesting, reaping, and funerals. In 1831 the first official military band was formed by Prince Miloš Obrenović. Roma people have adopted the tradition and enhanced the music, and today most of the best performers are Roma.|$|E
2500|$|The chancellors {{periodically}} met {{together at}} the Zhengshi Tang (政事堂, literally [...] "the Hall of State Matters"), originally physically located within the examination bureau. In 683, when Pei Yan, then {{the head of the}} examination bureau, became the head of the legislative bureau, the Zhengshi Tang was moved from the examination bureau to the legislative bureau. Later, during Emperor Xuanzong's reign, when Zhang Shuo became chancellor, he changed the name to Zhongshu Menxia (中書門下), apparently employing a double entendre, as when the terms were put together, they meant, [...] "within the doors of the Zhongshu." [...] Zhang also reorganized the Hall by creating five offices under the chancellors—in charge of civil <b>service,</b> <b>state</b> secrets, military matters, governance, and criminal law, respectively. Later in the dynasty—starting during the reign of Emperor Suzong — the chancellors begin to rotate off-days so that at least one would always be on duty; when submissions were to be made to the emperor, they were signed in the names of all chancellors, whether on duty or not. The name of their meeting place also changed back to Zhengshi Tang.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the site}} became {{the target of}} a denial-of-service attack on its old servers, WikiLeaks moved its website to Amazon's servers. Later, however, the website was [...] "ousted" [...] from the Amazon servers. In a public statement, Amazon said that WikiLeaks was not {{following}} its terms of service. The company further explained, [...] "There were several parts they were violating. For example, our terms of <b>service</b> <b>state</b> that 'you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content... that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity.' It's clear that WikiLeaks doesn't own or otherwise control all the rights to this classified content." [...] WikiLeaks was then moved to servers at OVH, a private web-hosting service in France. After criticism from the French government, the company sought two court rulings about the legality of hosting WikiLeaks. While the court in Lille immediately refused to force OVH to deactivate the WikiLeaks website, the court in Paris stated it would need more time to examine the complex technical issue.|$|E
