40|$|The {{nitrogen}} {{budgets of}} Eurotia lanata (Pursh.) Moq. and Atriplex confertifolia (Torr. and Frem.) S. Wats salt desert shrub plant communities were investigated. In each, a complete biomass and organic nitrogen inventory was made. In addition, {{investigations of the}} nitrogen fixation potential of <b>soil</b> surface <b>microflora</b> and inorganic <b>soil</b> nitrogen relationships were carried out. Greater total biomass and organic nitrogen {{was found in the}} above-ground portions, annual shoot productivity, and litter of the Atriplex community. However, the Atriplex community was exceeded by the Eurotia community in root biomass. Roots accounted for 74 and 87 percent of the plant biomass and 83 and 90 percent of the associated organic nitrogen in Eurotia and Atriplex communities respectively. Root biomass distribution at various depths was markedly different in the two communities. Differences between communities in relative amounts of various plant parts and litter are related to contrasting plant growth habit, and differences in soil texture and soil salinity. Total plant biomass estimates, which were 18, 480 and 17, 300 kilograms per hectare for Eurotia and Atriplex communities, were not significantly different and reflect the overriding influence of macroclimate and associated moisture limitation. Under laboratory conditions the <b>soil</b> surface <b>microflora</b> of the Atriplex community was able to fix significant amounts of atmospheric nitrogen while that of the Eurotia community did not. Nitrogen fixation potential in the Atriplex community was associated with the presence of abundant lichen cover and associated heterocvstcontaining blue-green algae of lichen interspaces. Differences between communities were found in rates of mineralization, downward flux, and pattern of utilization of inorganic soil nitrogen. Soil salinity appeared to strongly limit inorganic soil nitrogen mineralization as well as root growth and nitrogen uptake in {{the lower part of the}} Atriplex soil profile; however, this lack of biological activity was compensated for by a greater downward flux of inorganic soil nitrogen from decomposing litter and surface soil in the Atriplex community.

In this review, the ecological roles of phytoepiphytic bacteria will be described. The phylloplane and rhizoplane, which are adjacent to the atmosphere and soil sphere respectively, accumulate topically and /or selectively release secondary metabolites that are specific to the plant genera and species which reside within these regions. Some epiphytes have abilities to decarboxylate xenobiotic phenolic acids that have accumulated in the plant tissues and surface as a majority of such secondary metabolites. In physicochemically stressed <b>soil,</b> rhizosphere <b>microflora</b> often remedy such microenvironments within the rhizosphere in order to assist in the survival of the host, and some of the microfloral compositions behave as if they were symbionts.

In addition, as ants and termites build mounds, they transport soil materials from one horizon to another.

These remarkably diverse and adaptable fungi have been found in soils ranging from the Sonoran Desert, to tropical and temperate forests, grasslands and soils of the tundra. F. oxysporum strains are ubiquitous soil inhabitants that have the ability to exist as saprophytes, and degrade lignin and complex carbohydrates associated with soil debris. They are also pervasive plant endophytes that can colonize plant roots and may even protect plants or be the basis of disease suppression. Although the predominant role of these fungi in native soils may be as harmless or even beneficial plant endophytes or soil saprophytes, many strains within the F. oxysporum complex are pathogenic to plants, especially in agricultural settings.|$|E

There are certain strains which are nonpathogenic and protect plants from pathogenic strains. Based on phenotypic and genetic studies F. oxysporum showed a great diversity among its populations. The nonpathogenic strains, which were first isolated from suppressive soils strains showed several modes of action against pathogenic strains and thus exploited as biocontrol agents. These nonpathogenic strains suppress pathogens by competing for nutrients in the soil, reduce their chlamydospore germination, compete for infection sites on the root and induce systemic resistance in plant when invade host plant species before the pathogen. The nonpathogenic strains are formulated in talc and charcoal based media and commercial formulations are also available. These strains of Fusarium has been successfully combined with other biocontrol agents to obtain a effective biocontrol of plant pathogens. For application of nonpathogenic Fusarium under field condition some {{additional research is needed}} in several areas including: field studies and integration into production systems; risk assessment; and genetic improvement of biocontrol agents...|$|R

Induction of biodegradation capacity following BTEX addition was faster in the <b>soil</b> native <b>microflora</b> than in axenic soil cultures of the fungus.

40|$|Systemically induced {{resistance}} is a promising strategy to control plant diseases, as it affects numerous pathogens. However, since induced resistance reduces {{one or both}} growth and activity of plant pathogens, the indigenous microflora may also be affected by an enhanced defensive state of the plant. The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate how much the bacterial rhizosphere microflora of Arabidopsis is affected by induced systemic resistance (ISR) or systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Therefore, the bacterial microflora of wild-type plants and plants affected in their defense signaling was compared. Additionally, ISR was induced by application of methyl jasmonate and SAR by treatment with salicylic acid or benzothiadiazole. As a comparative model, we also used wild type and ethylene-insensitive tobacco. Some of the Arabidopsis genotypes affected in defense signaling showed altered numbers of culturable bacteria in their rhizospheres; however, effects were dependent on soil type. Effects of plant genotype on rhizosphere bacterial community structure could not be related to plant defense because chemical activation of ISR or SAR had no significant effects on density and structure of the rhizosphere bacterial community. These findings support the notion that control of plant diseases by elicitation of systemic resistance will not significantly affect the resident <b>soil</b> bacterial <b>microflora.</b> ...|$|R
