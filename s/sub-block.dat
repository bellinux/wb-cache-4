An animated GIF file comprises a number of frames that are displayed in succession, each introduced by its own GCE, which gives the time delay to wait after the frame is drawn. Global information {{at the start of the}} file applies by default to all frames. The data is stream-oriented, so the file-offset of the start of each GCE depends on the length of preceding data.

40|$|The high peak-to-average {{power ratio}} (PAPR) {{is one of}} the major {{problems}} of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in wireless transmission. Therefore, partial transmit sequence (PTS), a promising scheme that can provide good PAPR reduction performance, has been proposed for OFDM transmission to eliminate distortion. The PTS method divides the input data block into disjoint <b>sub-blocks,</b> computes Inverse Fourier Transform of the subblocks, rotates the <b>sub-blocks</b> with appropriate phase factors and combines them to form the transmitted signal. This paper presents an enhanced PTS approach that combines two PTS partitioning schemes (adjacent and interleaved) to effectively reduce the PAPR of the OFDM systems. The influence of the proposed approach on performance is investigated by varying the size of the disjoint <b>sub-blocks.</b> The PAPR reduction performance of the proposed PTS method is compared with two well known <b>sub-blocks</b> partitioning schemes, namely, Adjacent Partitioning (AP), Interleaved Partitioning (IP). The various computer simulation results for the various <b>sub-blocks</b> confirmed that the proposed method provides better PAPR reduction performance compared with AP and IP partitioning based PTS scheme. In addition, these PTS schemes largely depend on the chosen size of the partitions...|$|R
