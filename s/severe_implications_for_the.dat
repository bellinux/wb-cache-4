We present an algorithm that reconstructs the separatrix by using a Moving Least Squares approximant based on radial basis functions. The algorithm is applied to an eco-epidemiological model of pack hunting predators that suffer disease infection. Our analysis reveals that strong hunting cooperation considerably promotes the survival of predators and renders the predators resilient to perturbations...|$|E
40|$|Extract] Global {{climate change}} is among the {{greatest}} threats confronting both human and natural systems (IPCC, 2007). A substantial component of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is from energy production, generated via the burning of fossil fuels, especially coal, natural gas and refined petroleum. Given that reduction in global energy consumption is unlikely over the next century or so, renewable energy generation has been proposed as a low-carbon alternative to limit GHG emissions. Consequently, many national and regional governments have set targets for renewable energy manufacture and use (e. g. ' 20 % Wind Energy by 2030 ' – DoE, 2008; EU, 2009). Nevertheless, despite the benefits associated with reducing carbon emissions, renewable energy development itself has important, sometimes <b>severe,</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> conservation of biodiversity {{that should not be}} ignored. A central challenge and opportunity for animal conservation is to understand and manage environmental problems associated with the rapid growth in renewable energy production, while simultaneously maintaining progress toward reducing dependence on fossil fuels...|$|E

Indeed, they modulate diverse biological mechanisms involved in GI homeostasis and have been commonly used to reduce such disorders. In this chapter, we present the molecular mechanisms triggered by probiotic bacteria to modulate the gut physiology during gastrointestinal disorder and the importance of the gastrointestinal stresses tolerance as a limiting factors for probiotic application. Moreover, we focus on the emergence of functional probiotic foods, which can act as excellent vehicles, by enhancing stress tolerance and providing a protective matrix towards digestive stresses...|$|E

40|$|Several {{methods of}} impact {{assessment}} {{have been developed}} over the years which basically incorporate future climate projections of atmospheric-ocean circulation based climate models into the simulation of land surface hydrological processes. This study attempted to evaluate three methods of climate change impact assessment: (a) Frequency perturbation method, (b) direct method and (c) delta change method. A well-calibrated hydrologic model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was used in watershed simulation for climate projections of mid-century by ten Global Climate Models (GCMs). The frequency perturbation method found precipitation decrease by 17 % and reduction in temperature by 0. 43 °C on an average annual basis. The changes when applied through the simulation model resulted in 13 % reduction in Evapotranspiration (ET) and 25 % reduction in water yield. Other two methods produced different set of results. It’s not conclusive to say which method performed better. The frequency perturbation method produced most extreme changes while direct method had the least magnitude of changes projected for the mid-century.

Such a value is usually defined as the ratio between the intensity of the AME at 1 [*]cm and the thermal dust emission at 100 [*]μm. However, as studies of Galactic dust emission have shown, the intensity of the thermal dust emission at 100 [*]μm is strongly dependent on the dust temperature, which has <b>severe</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> AME emissivity defined in this way. In this work, we illustrate and quantify this effect and find that the AME emissivity decreases by a factor of 11. 1 between dust temperatures of 20 and 30 [*]K. We, therefore, conclude that computing the AME emissivity relative to the 100 [*]μm emission does not allow for accurate comparisons between the AME observed in different environments. With this in mind, we investigate the use of other tracers of the dust emission with which to compute the AME emissivity and we ultimately conclude that, despite the difficulty in deriving its value, the column density of the dust would be the most suitable quantity with which to compute the AME emissivity...|$|E

However, relationships between forest disturbance and avifaunal assemblages remain poorly understood, particularly on small island ecosystems such as {{those found in the}} biodiversity ‘hotspot’ of Wallacea. This study examines how avifaunal richness varies across a disturbance gradient in a forest reserve on Buton Island, South-East Sulawesi. Particular emphasis is placed upon examining responses in endemic and red-listed species with high conservation importance. Results indicate that overall avian richness increases between primary and 30 -year old regenerating secondary forest and then decreases through disturbed secondary forest, but is highest in cleared farmland. However, high species richness in farmland does not signify high species distinctiveness; bird community composition here differs significantly from that found in forest sites, and is poor in supporting forest specialists and endemic species. Certain large-bodied endemics such as the Knobbed Hornbill (Rhyticeros cassidix) appear to be sensitive to moderate disturbance, with populations occurring at greatest density within primary forest. However, overall endemic species richness, {{as well as that of}} endemic frugivores and insectivores, is similar in primary and secondary forest types. Results indicate that well-established secondary forest in particular has an important role in supporting species with high conservational importance, possessing community composition similar to that found in primary forest and supporting an equally high richness of endemic species...|$|R

In Sweden, COPD is also an increasingly problematic subject and the increase in tobacco smoking among women is the main cause of this. COPD causes <b>severe</b> economic <b>implications,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> individual but also for society. Increasing costs are a huge problem in healthcare and in the western world there is a substantial effort being made, trying {{to find new ways to}} restructure the health systems, preparing for escalating costs. A potential way <b>for</b> restructuring is <b>the</b> value based healthcare system, a system widely applied throughout western healthcare. One example of a clinic that has applied this system is the COPD-centre at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg. This study aims to evaluate the effect of the value based care performed at the COPD-centre on social disability and health related quality of life. Method This is a survey based study, quantifying social disability and health related quality of life and comparing these between patients about to be treated at the clinic and patients already treated. Results No statistical difference between the groups could be found, however a linear relationship between forced expiratory volume during the first second (FEV 1) and survey results could be made. Discussion The linear connection between survey results and FEV 1 implies that the survey indeed measured what was intended. The power of the connection and studies previously published in the area leads us to believe that longer follow up time is needed to fully estimate the effect that the value based care at the COPD-centre has.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} contribution that Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can {{make to the}} land suitability process {{used to determine the}} effects of a climate change scenario. The research is intended to redress the severe under representation of Developing countries within the literature examining the impacts of climatic change upon crop productivity. The methodology adopts some of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates for regional climate variations, based upon General Circulation Model predictions (GCMs) and applies them to a baseline climate <b>for</b> Bangladesh. Utilising <b>the</b> United Nations Food & Agricultural Organisation's Agro-ecological Zones land suitability methodology and crop yield model, the effects of the scenario upon agricultural productivity on 14 crops are determined. A Geographic Information System (IDRISI) is adopted in order to facilitate the methodology, in conjunction with a specially designed spreadsheet, used to determine the yield and suitability rating for each crop. A simple optimisation routine using the GIS is incorporated to provide an indication of the 'maximum theoretical' yield available to the country, should the most calorifically significant crops be cultivated on each land unit both before and after the climate change scenario. This routine will provide an estimate of the theoretical population supporting capacity of the country, both now and in the future, to assist with planning strategies and research. The research evaluates the utility of this alternative GIS based methodology <b>for</b> <b>the</b> land evaluation process and determines the relative changes in crop yields that may result from changes in temperature, photosynthesis and flooding hazard frequency. In summary, the combination of a GIS and a spreadsheet was successful, the yield prediction model indicates that the application of the climate change scenario will have a deleterious effect upon the yields of the study crops. Any yield reductions will have <b>severe</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> agricultural practices. <b>The</b> optimisation routine suggests that the 'theoretical maximum' population supporting capacity is well in excess of current and future population figures. If this agricultural potential could be realised however, it may provide some amelioration from the effects of climate change...|$|R

This study examined the nature, distribution and time-course of experimentally induced pain in the infrapatellar fat pad. Hypertonic saline (5 %) was injected into the medial fat pad of 11 healthy individuals with no history of knee pain. Severity of pain was assessed at rest and during activity using an 11 point numerical rating scale (NRS) at regular intervals over 15 - 30 min following injection. Participants described {{the size of the}} pain region from a series of different sized circles while the area and type of pain was established from a body chart and the McGill pain questionnaire. The effect of pain on temperature-pain threshold and sensory thresholds of the anterior knee was assessed. Participants generally reported a deep aching pain that peaked in severity around 3 min and gradually declined over 15 min. Pain levels were not altered by clinical manoeuvres designed to impinge the fat pad. The size of the pain region was related to pain intensity. Pain was most commonly felt in the region of the fat pad medial to the patella, although some individuals reported proximal referred pain as far as the groin region. Thermal and sensory thresholds were not altered at a region close to the injection site during the experimental pain. These results suggest that nociceptive stimulation of the infrapatellar fat pad may cause anterior knee pain that is not necessarily confined locally particularly if pain is <b>severe.</b> This has <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> investigation of pathological structures in patients presenting clinically with anterior knee pain and provides an experimental model of anterior knee pain.

40|$|Bankruptcies, {{voluntary}} liquidations, takeovers and mergers {{resulting from}} corporate financial distress {{play an important}} role in the economy and may have <b>severe</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> many stakeholders. <b>The</b> current global climate of high failure rates has therefore attracted the attention of academia, practitioners and policy makers, aiming to gain a thorough insight into business failure. Diverse shortcomings in the existing literature on failure prediction, failure paths and firm exit – often related to a narrow view to business failure – however limit our general understanding of business failure. This dissertation aims to extend our knowledge of the broader phenomenon of business failure. A first literature review study provides an overview of the shortcomings of the classic cross-sectional failure prediction models, which are extremely popular in business failure studies. This study emphasizes the focus on bankruptcy as the only exit resulting from failure, the neglect of the dynamic nature of failure and diverse causes of over-modelling. With a view to gain further insight into the broader phenomenon of business failure, two large scale empirical studies conduct an in-depth investigation of distress-related firm exits. Besides bankruptcies, they explore voluntary liquidations and takeovers, mergers and splits. This broader, dynamic and multi-level approach involves an investigation of exit paths, from the first sign of distress to legal exit. Both empirical studies are based on an extensive dataset of 6, 118 Belgian distress-related exits of privately held, mature SMEs. The first empirical study identifies determinants of the exit type through diverse firm characteristics at the first sign of distress and at exit. The results show that the available and potential slack resources and different factors influencing the relative expected value of voluntary liquidation compared to takeover or merger, impact the eventual exit after distress. The second empirical study explains the period between first signs of distress and exit by court driven exit (mainly bankruptcy) or voluntary liquidation. The results suggest that high slack resources at the first sign of distress postpone bankruptcy, but accelerate voluntary liquidation. Further, a high degree of stakeholder dependence extends the time to exit after distress, both for court driven exits and voluntary liquidations...|$|R

Consequently, understanding the properties of WR stars and their evolution is indispensable. A crucial but still not well known quantity determining the evolution of WR stars is their mass-loss rate. Since the mass loss is predicted to increase with metallicity, the feedback provided by these objects and their spectral appearance are expected to be a function of the metal content of their host galaxy. This has <b>severe</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> role of massive stars in general and the exploration of low metallicity environments in particular. Hitherto, the metallicity dependence of WR star winds was not well studied. In this contribution, we review the results from our comprehensive spectral analyses of WR stars in environments of different metallicities, ranging from slightly super-solar to SMC-like metallicities. Based on these studies, we derived empirical relations for the dependence of the WN mass-loss rates on the metallicity and iron abundance, respectively.

40|$|Procrastination is {{an almost}} archetypal {{phenomenon}} of human behaviour, the nature and prevalence of which may have <b>severe</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> foundations of Microeconomic theory and the rational actor model. This paper aims to assess why and how agents procrastinate in theory and what the implications of procrastination may be. It is argued that procrastination is a rational response to present-biased preferences and that the extent of procrastination, and the subsequent welfare implications thereof, depends {{on the degree of}} conscientiousness regarding one’s own expected future self-control problems and the nature and requirements of the task with which one is assigned. The theoretical model proposed to analyse procrastination therefore parameterises the temporal evolution of present-biased preferences as a function of agents’ levels of conscientiousness. It is found that less conscientious agents tend to procrastinate more than more conscientious agents, that uncertainty exacerbates the extent and compounds the implications of procrastinating behaviour, and, consequently, that procrastination {{is more likely to be}} welfare non-maximising the lower an agent’s level of conscientiousness and the greater the amount of uncertainty that exists regarding the nature and requirements of the task with which the agent is assigned. procrastination, dynamic inconsistency, present-biased preferences, quasi-hyperbolic discounting, differential salience, conscientiousness, sophistication, naivety...|$|E
40|$|Lower-back related {{injuries}} in an athletic population are common {{and may have}} <b>severe</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> athletes sporting career. The focus of this work was to review epidemiology, intervention strategies, and recommendations for return to practice and competition for athletes with lumbar disc degeneration and herniated disc. Conservative treatments for discogenic degeneration and lumbar spine herniation are generally sufficient for athletic populations to restore functional movement. Athletes that fail to respond to conservative measures may consider lumbar discectomy, {{with high levels of}} return to pre-competition levels observed following effective surgery. Surgical procedures such as spinal fusion and disc replacement require careful consideration, and should only be recommended if the athlete fails to respond to vigorous conservative treatments. Spinal disc implants have durability and mechanical loading concerns, whereas spinal fusion may ultimately prevent participation in contact sports. Specific guidelines for return to practice and competition remain poorly defined, thus future investigations should address this gap in knowledge. Return to sports should be carefully recommended after the athlete demonstrates sufficient improvements in neuro-physiological, biomechanical, and psychological domains. The correct rehabilitative exercise programme is vital to the rehabilitation of athletes following injury, and should consider frequent monitoring of pain, range of motion and muscle function...|$|E
40|$|The economic, {{fiscal and}} {{environmental}} crises evident in contemporary political economy carry {{a set of}} interconnected, profound and largely unacknowledged sustainability challenges <b>for</b> <b>the</b> welfare state. This is particularly the case if the environmental crisis constitutes a severe set of limitations upon further economic expansion or demands that post-industrial societies begin to normatively question the primacy of pursuing ad infinitum economic growth. The crisis narratives identified are conceptualised here as a triple crisis afflicting welfare state sustainability, and this more holistic and innovative understanding of the current conjuncture is {{the starting point of}} an analysis which interrogates the tensions and inter-dependencies between the fiscal and environmental sustainability of the welfare state. This research agenda prompts a dialogue between two literatures which have largely remained segregated from each other up to this point, despite them both being embraced by progressives. The first is the literature on the fiscal sustainability of the welfare state, which is invariably predicated upon assumptions of future growth either to manage demographic changes or to rationalise counter-cyclical spending during economic downturns. The second is the scholarship on post-growth, which has enjoyed a notable resurgence in recent years due to its environmental and social critique of societies dedicated to pursuing economic growth. Bringing these literatures together has <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> study of welfare state sustainability. On the one hand, if the fiscal sustainability of the welfare state is predicated upon the public expenditure extracted from an environmentally-unsustainable growth dynamic it is surely necessary to problematise the concept of sustainability conventionally used in the welfare state scholarship. Meanwhile, the prospect of pursuing environmental sustainability through challenging the economic primacy of economic growth would mean a suppression of monetised economic activity, <b>severe</b> fiscal <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> capitalist state and an uncomfortable degree of welfare state retrenchment. The post-growth literature’s assertion that growth no longer impacts positively on wellbeing, therefore, is challenged by highlighting the potential effects of the absence of growth on the institutions of the welfare state. This constitutes a paradox for welfare state sustainability, and it is only complicated further by the evidence suggesting that welfare states can potentially be conducive to environmental governance more directly through facilitating decarbonisation strategies, maintaining monetarily and ecologically efficient public welfare services, and promote notions of the ‘public good’. This would mean that any post-growth transition may ironically be counter-productive if it does produce a conflagration of public welfare programmes. These are a set of paradoxes for welfare state sustainability which will be difficult to negotiate within the current political settlement. As such, my research speaks to debates concerning how progressives can map out a policy direction in the 21 st century which meets both our social sensibilities – which are typically met through those state mechanisms financed by monetised economic activity – and our environmental imperatives – which may require us to question economic growth. This thesis, therefore, contributes to both bodies of scholarship under examination through exploring the intractability of the tensions and inter-dependencies between their discourses and <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> of this <b>for</b> welfare state sustainability and progressive politics more broadly...|$|R
40|$|Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is a {{controlled}} disease in South Africa. This disease {{is caused by}} an Arterivirus and occurs commonly in Europe (European serotype) and in the United States of America (American serotype); therefore PRRS is not a trade sensitive disease. However, the disease has <b>severe</b> economic <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> producer and the local pork industry and {{the decision was made}} by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in association with the South African Pork Producers’ Organization (SAPPO) to eradicate the disease when the first outbreak occurred in 2004 in the Western Cape. Severe disease leading to acute mortalities and almost 100 % mortality and morbidity rate in a few pig units in the Jacobsdal area (Kuilsrivier district) in the Cape Town peninsula, alarmed local veterinary consultants during the autumn of 2004. A first diagnosis of Salmonella choleraesuis was confirmed at the Provincial Veterinary Laboratory in Stellenbosch. Antibiotic treatment did not resolve the clinical picture. Sows still aborted and died and young pigs still died from acute respiratory distress. The syndrome was similar to “blue ear disease” because of severe cyanosis visible on the extremities of affected pigs. The first suspected diagnosis of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV) was made on post mortem examination on 10 June 2004 and was confirmed on 17 June 2004 with positive ELISA (Idexx Herdchek PRRSV Ab test kit 2 XR) results. A stamping out procedure immediately followed through slaughtering of all affected pigs showing clinical signs of PRRSV infection. Pigs in close proximity with possible contact and infection risk were also slaughtered. The movement of pigs was only allowed under Red Cross permit and all pig auctions were stopped. A local and countrywide serological survey was implemented immediately. The results of this survey luckily showed that the outbreak was limited to a few districts in the Western Cape. The probable source of infection is suspected to be uncooked swill originating from the Cape Town Harbour or the Cape Town International Airport, which was fed to pigs. <b>The</b> PRRSV responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> outbreak was confirmed on 5 July 2004 as the American serotype by RT-PCR test done at Lelystad, Netherlands. The National Department of Agriculture (NDA) * agreed to compensate pig owners for slaughtered pigs. This decision was further made possible by funding from SAPPO to protect the rest of the commercial pig herd in South Africa to ensure food safety and security. A total of 32 pig units were affected by PRRS of which only one was a commercial unit. All affected pigs were slaughtered by the end of August 2004. Units were cleaned and disinfected by the staffs of the Boland and Swartland State veterinary departments with approved disinfectants which is effective against PRRSV. Cleaned units had to stay empty of pigs for at least 8 weeks after disinfection was completed. Restocking was only allowed from known PRRS-free pig suppliers and regular monitoring was implemented of all previously infected sites and units in high risk areas. On-going serological monitoring revealed no more positive cases since May 2005. It seems that the stamping out procedure and a temporary ban on movement and auctions of live pigs played a primary role in eradication of the PRRSV outbreak in South Africa in 2004. * The name of the NDA has been changed to the National Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) in 2009, but because the NDA was the applicable name when the PRRS outbreak occurred, NDA will be used in this document.
