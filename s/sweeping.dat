40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} experiments has been performed to determine flowsheet conditions for formation of boron solids during processing of glovebox floor <b>sweepings</b> (FS) and sand, slag, and crucible (S,S, and C) materials in canyon dissolvers. The precipitation of a boron compound (KBF 4) was identified during the flowsheet development work for processing Rocky Flats S,S, and C materials at Savannah River. The subsequent series of laboratory experiments {{has focused on}} flowsheet conditions planned for the dissolution of glovebox floor <b>sweepings</b> in S,S, and C solutions. The concentrations of potassium fluoride (KF) and total fluoride were established where precipitation of boron solids would and would not occur during the processing of floor <b>sweepings.</b> Other variables such as changes in nitric acid and iron concentrations {{were found to have}} no impact on formation of boron solids. Results presented in Table 1 indicate that boron solids will not form at 0. 22 molar KF and 0. 30 molar total fluoride during processing of floor <b>sweepings</b> and at 0. 22 molar KF and 0. 32 molar total fluoride during processing of S,S, and C materials...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a dissolution flowsheet for neptunium (Np) oxide (NpO{sub 2 }) residues (i. e., various NpO{sub 2 } sources, HB-Line glovebox <b>sweepings,</b> and Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) thermogravimetric analysis samples). Samples of each type of materials proposed for processing were dissolved in a closed laboratory apparatus and the rate and total quantity of off-gas were measured. Samples of the off-gas were also analyzed. The quantity and type of solids remaining (when visible) were determined after post-dissolution filtration of the solution. Recommended conditions for dissolution of the NpO{sub 2 } residues are: Solution Matrix and Loading: {approx} 50 g Np/L (750 g Np in 15 L of dissolver solution), using 8 M nitric acid (HNO{sub 3 }), 0. 025 M potassium fluoride (KF) at greater than 100 C for at least 3 hours. Off-gas: Analysis of the off-gas indicated nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO{sub 2 }) and nitrous oxide (N{sub 2 }O) as the only identified components. No hydrogen (H{sub 2 }) was detected. The molar ratio of off-gas produced per mole of Np dissolved ranged from 0. 25 to 0. 4 moles of gas per mole of Np dissolved. A peak off-gas rate of {approx} 0. 1 scfm/kg bulk oxide was observed. Residual Solids: Pure NpO{sub 2 } dissolved with little or no residue with the proposed flowsheet but the NpCo and both <b>sweepings</b> samples left visible solid residue after dissolution. For the NpCo and Part II <b>Sweepings</b> samples the residue amounted to {approx} 1 % of the initial material, but for the Part I <b>Sweepings</b> sample, the residue amounted to {approx} 8 % of the initial material. These residues contained primarily aluminum (Al) and silicon (Si) compounds that did not completely dissolve under the flowsheet conditions. The residues from both <b>sweepings</b> samples contained minor amounts of plutonium (Pu) particles. Overall, the undissolved Np and Pu particles in the residues were a very small fraction of the total solids...|$|R
