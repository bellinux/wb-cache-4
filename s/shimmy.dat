5|$|Wobble, <b>shimmy,</b> tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). Also involved is the yawing of the rear frame which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While wobble or <b>shimmy</b> can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|Between {{these last}} two speeds, if they both exist, is a range of forward speeds at which the {{particular}} bike design is self-stable. In {{the case of the}} bike whose eigenvalues are shown here, the self-stable range is 5.3–8.0m/s (1218mph). The fourth eigenvalue, which is usually stable (very negative), represents the castoring behavior of the front wheel, as it tends to turn towards the direction in which the bike is traveling. Note that this idealized model does not exhibit the wobble or <b>shimmy</b> and rear wobble instabilities described above. They are seen in models that incorporate tire interaction with the ground or other degrees of freedom.|$|E
5|$|Wobble or <b>shimmy</b> {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor irregularity, such as fork asymmetry, accelerates {{the wheel to}} one side. The restoring force is applied in phase with {{the progress of the}} irregularity, and the wheel turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient damping in the steering the oscillation will increase until system failure occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness of the steering, of which the rider is a main component.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{dynamic and}} control {{issues related to}} a dynamical model called the classical <b>shimmying</b> wheel. The classical <b>shimmying</b> wheel models the rolling dynamics of many physical rolling systems such as aircraft nose wheels, motorcycles, automotive systems and tractor [...] trailer systems. Such system can exhibit undesirable unstable rolling motion, i. e. <b>shimmying,</b> which can often lead to disastrous results. Prior work with this particular model {{has focused on the}} stability of the system as well as an analysis of the qualitative nature of its dynamics, including numerical observation of possible chaotic behavior. Such behavior is observed when the rolling element is allowed to slip under certain conditions, which is intended to realistically model real physical rolling systems. In cases where the rolling dynamics of the system are unstable, the dynamics are characterized by the presenece of an attractor wherein the system repeatedly switches back and forth between rolling and [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Shimmies, shivers and vibrations: Small, fast, {{continuous}} {{movements of}} the hips or ribcage, which create an impression of texture and depth of movement. Shimmies are commonly layered over other movements, and are often used to interpret rolls on the or riq or fast strumming of the oud or qanun (instrument). There are many types of <b>shimmy,</b> varying in size and method of generation. Some common shimmies include relaxed, up and down hip shimmies, straight-legged knee-driven shimmies, fast, tiny hip vibrations, twisting hip shimmies, bouncing 'earthquake' shimmies, and relaxed shoulder or ribcage shimmies.|$|E
25|$|Although the band's {{work can}} be {{documented}} back to 1982 with the Early Boredoms compilation released with Soul Discharge, the earlier records by the band under the name Boredoms, Anal by Anal and Soul Discharge, were put out on the small independent Japanese labels while American label <b>Shimmy</b> Disc and English label Earthnoise distributed records overseas. Their success garnered attention from the Warner Music Group as its Japanese and American sublabels, WEA Japan and Reprise, released Pop Tatari in 1992 and 1993. Reprise dropped the band after the 1996 release of Super Roots 6, and the band's United States releases were picked back up by Birdman. The band went on hiatus {{for a few years}} around 2001 when the Rebore series was finished; they were consequently dropped by Birdman.|$|E
