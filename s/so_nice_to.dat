25|$|The {{showcasing}} and unorthodoxy of Dilshan {{was best}} highlighted against India on 15 December 2009, where Sri Lanka chased a mammoth target of 414 posted by India. The pitch at Rajkot looked <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> bat on, Dilshan started the run chase with Tharanga, instead of Jayasuriya. The blistering knock reached fifty from 38 balls and then hundred from 73 balls. His first 150 came from 115 balls and Sri Lanka {{on the brink}} of a sensational win. The knock of 160 was full of hooks, pulls and many scoops of his variety, leading the way to victory. But after Dilshan falls bowled by Harbhajan Singh, the match opened for Indians. They took all the advantages and Sri Lanka bowled out for 411 runs, in an eye margin for the victory. This was Dilshan's third century in ODIs, where the match was described by commentators as one of the best chases in World Cricket.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{scheduled}} to premiere at RKO's flagship theater Radio City Music Hall on February 14, but in early January 1941 Welles was not finished with post-production work and told RKO that it still needed its musical score. Writers for national magazines had early deadlines and so a rough cut was previewed for a select few on January 3, 1941 for such magazines as Life, Look and Redbook. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (and Parsons' arch rival) showed up to the screening uninvited. Most of the critics at the preview said that they liked the film and gave it good advanced reviews. Hopper wrote negatively about it, calling the film a [...] "vicious and irresponsible attack on a great man" [...] and criticizing its corny writing and old fashioned photography. Friday magazine ran an article drawing point-by-point comparisons between Kane and Hearst and documented how Welles had led on Parsons, Hollywood correspondent for Hearst papers. Up until this Welles had been friendly with Parsons. The magazine quoted Welles as saying that he couldn't understand why she was <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> him and that she should [...] "wait until the woman finds out that the picture's about her boss." [...] Welles immediately denied making the statement {{and the editor of}} Friday admitted that it may be false. Welles apologized to Parsons and assured her that he had never made that remark.|$|E
500|$|Shonda Rhimes, series' creator, {{says that}} the {{character}} was envisioned [...] "an old-fashioned tortured hero" [...] and likens him to Heathcliff. Originally set to appear in a multi-episode story arc, Kevin McKidd's contract was extended, securing him a slot as a series' regular of Grey's Anatomy. In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced the possibility of McKidd becoming a series' regular, with this possibility eventually being confirmed by People. When asked of how he got involved with the show, McKidd offered the insight: [...] McKidd told BuddyTV, [...] "It's been really great. I was nervous when I started because every job I've ever done before this, I {{have been in the}} job right from day one when everybody's new and getting to know each other. So I was nervous because I had never done this before. And I feel really grateful to the Grey's cast and crew and everyone there, really, because they've been <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> me and gracious and accepting of me joining the show. The transition was much easier than I thought it might be, which I'm very grateful for." [...] McKidd has told People that he thinks Grey's Anatomy is a great show and he feels lucky to be on it. Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, said of his addition, [...] "I am excited to have Kevin McKidd joining us for the season, he's been a delight to collaborate with and brings incredible passion, talent and creativity to his work. Plus, he’s already got the ‘Mc’ built into his name so we had to keep him." ...|$|E

Amelia Heinle, who critics praised for her portrayal of Victoria, has been listed on the [...] "Top 5 Actresses" [...] poll of CBS Soaps In Depth for over eight consecutive weeks. [...] Her relationship with Billy has garnered a significant fan following, allowing them to lead CBS Soaps In Depths [...] "Top 10 Couples" [...] poll for over six consecutive weeks. Elinor Donahue, who portrayed the judge that marries Victoria and Billy, said she thought their [...] "retro wedding" [...] was [...] "adorable" [...] and [...] "extremely well written and not overdone". Zap2it placed Victoria and Billy at number four of their [...] "10 Best Soap Couples of 2011". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it said Victoria and Billy are [...] "so scrumptious together", and that [...] "it's <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> have some reason to say something kind about The Young and the Restless for a change". Giddens {{also said that he}} [...] "adores this pairing that he was so prepared to hate". Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote of their relationship: [...] "Billy (Billy Miller) and Victoria (Amelia Heinle), who have already had three weddings in the year and a half that they have been together, actually seem rational. They should change the wedding vows in the G.C. from [...] "until death to us part," [...] to [...] "until one of us changes our mind." [...] However, Bibel was later unfavorable of the couple attempting to have a child less than six months after marrying.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Stransky was {{favorable}} of both Strong's narration {{and performance}} in the fifth season episode [...] "The Best Thing That Could Have Ever Happened", describing Mary Alice's role in the episode as [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and writing: [...] "I know we hear Brenda Strong nearly every week in her voiceovers, but it was <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see her on screen again! That lady can act." [...] Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic was bored by Mary Alice's flashback scenes in the sixth season episode [...] "Epiphany", believing them to be unrealistic. Daniel Goldberg of Slant Magazine praised Mary Alice's narration in the series finale in 2012, writing: [...] "There was one resolution that truly resonated. When the ladies all move out of [...] Lane and politely promise {{to keep in touch}} and visit, Mary Alice (Brenda Strong) takes the opportunity to unearth one last lie. With one of her most somber voiceovers ever, she lets us in on a secret that the housewives already know: They won’t keep in touch, and they won’t visit. The moment is far more unsettling and existential than the overblown sequence of the desperately deceased gathering to wave Susan goodbye. Deep friendships and passing acquaintances can never be replicated, and these are the endings we experience every day, even as we try to deny their finality." [...] Writing for Backstage magazine in 2012, Jeffery Self wrote that Strong's narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming [...] "one of the most familiar on television". As a result of her popularity as the series' narrator, Anna Silman of Vulture magazine described Strong as [...] "everybody's favorite deceased housewife/omniscient narrator" [...] in 2014.|$|E

In the Washington Square Park sequence, only Skip Hinnant was a professional actor; Fritz's friends were voiced by young males Bakshi found in the park. One of the sequences that was not based upon Crumb's comics involved a comic chase through a synagogue full of praying rabbis. For the voices of the rabbis, Bakshi used a documentary recording of his father and uncles. This scene continued to have a personal significance on Bakshi after his father and uncle died. Bakshi states, [...] "Thank God I have their voices. I have my dad and family praying. It's <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> hear now."
