At the same time, we <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> we mean when we use the expression..." [...] Wright argued that David's book itself was largely about {{specifically}} French Mediterranean food, pointing out that [...] "only 4 percent of her recipes come from North Africa or the Levant".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinion was}} divided on Aniston's {{performance}} as Claire. TV Guides Matt Mitovich wrote that Aniston [...] "looked sweet, but the role was juuuuust a bit much... over-the-top." [...] Jeremy Medina of Paste {{said that the}} show did not really <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to do with Aniston in this episode. Tom Stempel for Slant Magazine said 30 Rock was [...] "smart enough" [...] not to make Claire resemble Aniston's former television character, Rachel, from Friends. Further in his review, Stempel said that Claire was a [...] "great choice of character" [...] for Aniston to play, and praised her for knocking the role [...] "out of the park." [...] Kerrie Murphy for The Australian was equally positive noting that Aniston fits in smoothly as Liz's former roommate. Murphy added, [...] "Not only is it a reminder that Aniston is a gifted comic actor [...] With her, the show's regular cast easily hold their own." ...|$|E
500|$|Joseph R. Atilano of Inquirer Entertainment praised [...] "Circles" [...] {{as one of}} the catchiest {{songs of}} the album and {{compared}} the track to songs by Rihanna and Nicki Minaj. Kitty Empire of The Observer commented that the [...] "sing-song verse is redolent of Rihanna". Montreal Gazette editor T'cha Dunlevy simply described it as [...] "a raunchy flip of the bird to haters". HitFix writer Melinda Newman called it a [...] "shape-shifting" [...] and compared Aguilera to Gwen Stefani [...] "as she adopts a patois". Annie Zaleschi of The A.V. Club was mixed, naming it a [...] "bitter '90s alt-rock crossed with M.I.A.'s antagonistic attitude; it should be an angry kiss-off. Instead, cringe-inducing lyrics sap its ire". For Michael Gallucci of PopCrush, the song [...] "dips back to the bubblegum pop of Aguilera's debut for the verses, but pumps a ton of distortion into her voice during the refrains. 'Circles' doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> kind of song it wants it to be, so it settles for two not very good ones".|$|E

500|$|... "Exposé" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews. Lindelof {{admitted that}} the episode [...] "created a varying degree of fan reaction", with some fans even describing it as [...] "filler". But Cuse defended [...] "Exposé", saying it was [...] "a {{little bit more of}} an anthology episode for the show", and that he felt that [...] "it's unrealistic, in a show that is now 72 episodes in, that every episode is gonna be, you know, chock full of plot momentum. I think it's entirely reasonable, and we sort of by necessity have to have episodes that aren't super-narratively, you know, propelled." [...] Daniel of TMZ.com said that the episode [...] "was a complete waste of time", and that although he [...] "wanted Nikki and Paulo to die", he did not think their deaths warranted an entire episode. Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen wrote that although he liked the cameo appearance of Billy Dee Williams, he did not think [...] "Exposé" [...] "will do much to change anyone's minds" [...] about Nikki and Paulo, who were already unpopular characters. Brooke Tarnoff, a writer for UGO.com, wrote that she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] for Lost. New York Magazine put [...] "Exposé" [...] at the top of its list of [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes". However, TV Guides Matt Roush very much praised the episode for [...] "weaving flashbacks that appeared to be posthumous but really weren't while providing clever new angles on classic Lost moments from previous seasons", Roush {{went on to say that}} [...] "Exposé" [...] was [...] "a welcome reminder that sometimes these producers really do <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they're doing after all." [...] Chris Carabott of IGN also gave a positive review, stating that while Nikki and Paulo had no real impact on the overall storyline, [...] "their ultimate end made for an entertaining hour of television". The IGN staff later ranked [...] "Exposé" [...] 58th out of the 113 Lost episodes, describing it as [...] "one of the series' darkest and most fun episodes".|$|E
500|$|Ayane's {{gameplay}} {{abilities in}} other games were regarded more variably. In the DOA Xtreme and Paradise beach volleyball games, Ayane has excellent technique and jump abilities, {{at the cost}} of poor defence, power and speed. According to Official Xbox Magazine, Ayane is [...] "not exactly who you want to spike at the net or try to blow past blocks, but she's excellent at long spikes, digging, and soft dinks." [...] As such, Ayane is most effective as a support, but she should not be paired with Kasumi due to their rivalry; to partner with each other, Ayane and Kasumi need convincing by gift-giving. In Ninja Gaiden Σ 2, Ayane's attacks (many of her Fuma Kodachi combos resemble her combos from Dead or Alive) and finishing moves are far faster than these of Ryu, but the player has to learn to dodge much more as she has worse blocking abilities. The official guide to this game by Prima's Bryan Dawson states that Ayane's short range and limited attack power [...] "make her the worst choice of the three new characters for almost every mission" [...] and [...] "her only saving graces" [...] are a powerful ninpo spell and deadly Flash Kunai projectiles. In addition, if controlled by the console in the co-op mode, the character [...] "doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to do in any situation." [...] Mitch Dyer of IGN opined that a vastly improved Ayane from Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge is [...] "a damn fine addition" [...] to the game, where she is [...] "just as capable as Ryu Hayabusa" [...] with her [...] "quick and vicious" [...] melee attacks and explosive kunai projectiles, adding that she is [...] "functionally similar to Hayabusa in terms of combos and skills, complete with a screen-clearing special move." [...] Similarly, Retro Gamer described her simply as [...] "a nimbler version of Ryu." [...] David Lynch of X360 wrote all the [...] "girls" [...] of Razor's Edge (Ayane, Kasumi and Momiji) became [...] "just as deadly" [...] in it as Ryu Hayabusa has been through the Ninja Gaiden series. In Fatal Frame, unlike the protagonists of the game, Ayane can not permanently defeat ghosts and her strategy relies on evasion.|$|E
