40|$|International audienceHybrid {{electrical}} energy storage systems (HESS) show promise for solving {{the problems and}} exploiting the benefits of heterogeneous electrical storage systems (ESS). This paper compares {{the performance of a}} lead-acid battery/supercapacitors hybrid to that of a battery alone <b>under</b> <b>pulsed</b> <b>loads.</b> Two types of aging protocols, using pulsed and smoothed power, were carried out on VRLA batteries at 40 °C. These protocols typically illustrate a single or hybrid battery’s use for an Uninterruptible Power Supply. In HESS, the supercapacitors smooth the power demand applied to the battery, and, when idle, the battery charges the supercapacitors. The same amount of energy is extracted from the battery during both protocols. The experiment indicated that the battery alone performs 150 ten-minute-cycles before reaching the end of its life. In the hybridized battery, the power dissipated was reduced to 36 % of that used by the battery alone, and the number of cycles increased by 70 %. The use of a hybrid also reduced the battery’s capacity fade by 60 % and its increase of internal resistance by 83 %.

40|$|The sensor nodes of {{wireless}} sensor networks remain inactive {{most of the time}} to achieve longer runtimes. Power is mainly provided by batteries, which are either primary or secondary. Because of its internal impedance, a significant voltage drop can appear across the battery terminals at the activation time of the node, thus preventing the extraction of all the energy from the battery. Additionally, internal losses can also be significant. Consequently, the runtime is reduced. The addition of a supercapacitor in parallel with the battery, thus forming a hybrid-storage device, has been proposed <b>under</b> <b>pulsed</b> <b>loads</b> to increase the power capabilities and reduce both the voltage drop and the internal losses at the battery. However, this strategy has not yet thoroughly been analyzed and tested in low-power wireless sensor nodes.

The absolute values of these MRs are found to be similar despite 4 - 5 orders of magnitude difference between the corresponding resistivities. These similarities, as well as the giant magnitude of the MRs, exceeding any orbital contribution by two orders of magnitude, could be broadly understood as the result of the breaking of preformed pairs by the magnetic field. The resistive upper critical fields H-c 2 (T), estimated from the in-and out-of-plane MRs taken below T-c, are approximately the same and reveal non-BCS temperature dependences compatible with the Bose-Einstein condensation field of preformed charged bosons.

Then samples were annealed in {{air at the}} temperatures ranging from 400 to 1000 °C. The XRD measurements proved that a gradual phase change from anatase to rutile occurs with increasing annealing temperature. The anatase-to-rutile transformation occurs between 500 and 600 °C. The changes in the average crystallite sizes of anatase and rutile occurring during heat treatment of ATO layers were correlated with the mechanism of rutile phase nucleation.

Two methods of testing {{and the results of}} dynamic coefficient kd for aluminum alloys, copper, brass, steel, and some other materials are presented. The first method is based on expansion of rings machined from tubular blanks, which are designated for further stamping operations. The displacement of the ring was registered by using the light shading method. Parameters of the discharge electric current running through the electromagnetic coil were measured with a Rogowski gauge. The acceleration stage of the ring expansion process was used for more accurate calibration of the inductive gauge defining the parameters of electromagnetic pressure. Registering the kinematics of the ring during the inertial stage of the deformation process provided the information on dynamic behavior of the studied material. The second method employed in this paper for dynamic yield stress measurement was based on transverse <b>pulsed</b> <b>loading</b> of a sheet sample clamped by its ends.

It investigates and quantifies {{the benefits of}} the hybrid ESS over its battery-only counterparts. The metric for quantifying the benefits is charge efficiency - the amount of energy delivered to the load per unit charge supplied by the battery. The efficiency gain is defined as the difference in charge efficiency between the hybrid and the battery-only ESS. A custom experimental apparatus is designed and built to supply the current control for charging and discharging the batteries, as well as the data acquisition for measuring energy and current output. Experiments are performed on both ESSs <b>under</b> four different <b>pulsed</b> <b>load</b> profiles: 1. 436 ms pulse period, 10 % duty cycle, 8 A pulse amplitude 2. 436 ms pulse period, 25 % duty cycle, 8 A pulse amplitude 3. 436 ms pulse period, 10 % duty cycle, 16 A pulse amplitude 4. 436 ms pulse period, 25 % duty cycle, 16 A pulse amplitude Circuit models are created to accurately represent the battery and ultracapacitors. These models are used in simulations of the same test cases from the physical experiments, and efficiency gains are compared. The circuit models differed from the experimentation by less than 1 %. Both experimental and simulated data demonstrate significantly increased charge efficiencies of hybrid ESSs over battery-only ESSs, with demonstrated gains between 10 % and 36 %. These benefits were greatest for the 16 A, 10 % duty cycle test case because it combined the highest pulse amplitude and the shortest duty cycle. It is concluded that high-amplitude, low duty cycle, and low period pulsedload profiles yield the highest efficiency gains. by. Ian C. SmithThesis (S. M.)

A mobile generator delivered 110 kJ to the magnet coil, which was sufficient to generate peak fields of 30 T. A liquid He flow cryostat allowed us to vary the sample temperature accurately between 8 and 300 K. Powder diffraction patterns of several samples were recorded using 21 keV monochromatic x-rays and an on-line image plate detector. Here we present the first results on {{the suppression of the}} Jahn-Teller structural distortion in TbVO 4 by magnetic field. These data clearly demonstrate the feasibility of x-ray powder diffraction experiments <b>under</b> <b>pulsed</b> magnetic fields with relatively inexpensive instrumentation.
