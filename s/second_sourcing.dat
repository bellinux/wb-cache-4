In a <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> mechanism, the buyer keeps the option open to source from a new supplier in the future.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{decision}} of a manufacturer (the buyer), expecting new sourcing opportunities in the future, in selecting between sole- and second-sourcing strategies for a noncommodity component. In a sole-sourcing strategy, the buyer commits to sourcing from a single supplier (the incumbent) over the entire horizon. In a second-sourcing strategy, the buyer keeps the option open to source from a new supplier (the entrant) in the future. Supplier costs are private information, and the incumbent's cost may change in the future because of what it has learned. The buyer is relatively sure about current demand but uncertain about future demand. A supplier has to invest in capacity to produce the inputs for the buyer. With future private cost information, the incumbent earns rent in the future, and this prospective rent influences the incumbent's decision early in the horizon. On one hand, a second-sourcing strategy allows the buyer {{to take advantage of}} alternative sourcing opportunities, lowering her future cost. This benefit to the buyer {{is referred to as the}} option value of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing.</b> On the other hand, the future supplier competition in second-sourcing hurts the incumbent's future profit. The expectation of a lower future profit in <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> induces the incumbent to ask for a higher price at the beginning of the horizon. This causes more initial sourcing cost for the buyer in <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> than in sole sourcing, and is referred to as the cost of future supplier competition of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing.</b> The overall benefit of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> relative to sole sourcing is influenced by the demand distribution and capacity cost. If the demand increases over time with positive probability, the incumbent's initial capacity may not be able to cover all future demand. If the capacity is cheap, the entrant may serve as an exclusive supplier, ousting the incumbent. In this case, the option value of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is high. If the capacity is expensive, the entrant may serve as a supplementary supplier by receiving only the demand in excess of the incumbent's installed capacity. In this case, the cost of future supplier competition is low and the option value is still significant. Thus <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is better than sole sourcing not only when the capacity cost is low, but also when it is high (under the condition that demand increases over time with positive probability and the entrant's cost is relatively low). For intermediate capacity cost, the cost of future supplier competition dominates the option value; hence, sole sourcing is preferred. We also find that <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is more attractive when the buyer expects the future demand to be higher or more volatile. Finally, more initial incumbent capacity strengthens the incumbent's competitiveness against the entrant, reducing the cost of future supplier competition. As a result, we find that <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> may lead to overinvestment of the initial capacity. sourcing, auction, supplier relationship, supply chain management...|$|E

40|$|Approved for Public release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis research effort was undertaken {{to analyze the}} use of Form, Fit, and Function as a <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> methodology for major weapon systems. The major objectives of the research were to determine what the main attributes of Form, Fit, and Function were and how it could best be successfully employed. The researcher found that Form, Fit, and Function would most likely {{not be used for}} the reprocurement of entire weapon systems. The real potential of this methodology was in the procurement of components and subsystems. In this regard, it can be used successfully for simple or technically complex items, initial or follow-on buys, and as a means of retrofitting existing equipments.

40|$|Abstract: Multinationals often serve {{foreign markets}} by {{producing}} domestically and exporting {{as well as}} by investing directly in foreign production facilities. We argue that if the multinational competes in an oligopolistic market characterized by strategic complements then there are strategic reasons to use two production facilities [...] committing to a second source allows the firm to keep average cost low {{while at the same time}} increasing its marginal cost. The increase in marginal cost softens product market competition resulting in higher profits. In our model, firms can sink capacity domestically, where the constant marginal cost is known, sink capacity in the foreign country, where the constant marginal cost is uncertain, or do both. In the absence of strategic considerations, the firm usually chooses to either export or use foreign direct investment [...] it rarely uses both sources of production. In contrast, price competition in the product market makes it much more likely that the firm will choose to use a second source. In fact, there are cases in which the firm sinks capacity in both locations even in the absence of cost uncertainty. We argue that this theory also has implications for the “make or buy ” literature in production management and the literature on <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> in industrial organization. Finally, we show that the practice of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> has implications for the degree of exchange rate pass through when the uncertainty about foreign costs is driven by fluctuations in the exchange rate...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the {{manufacturing}} and support activities associated with long life cycle products, parts need to be dependably and consistently available. However, the parts that comprise long life cycle products are susceptible to a variety of supply chain disruptions. In order to minimize the impact of these unavoidable disruptions to product production and support, manufacturers can implement proactive mitigation strategies. Careful selection of the mitigation strategy (<b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> and/or buffering) is key, as it can dramatically impact the part total cost of ownership. This thesis developed a simulation model that performs tradeoff analyses and identifies a near-optimal combination of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> and buffering for specific part and product scenarios. In addition, this thesis explores the effectiveness of traditional analytical models when compared to a simulation-based approach for the selection of an effective optimal disruption mitigation strategy. Several case studies were performed that: 1) tested the impact of popular analytical limiting assumptions, and 2) implemented realistic disruption data in the context of real part management. The first set of case studies demonstrated that the simulation model is capable of overcoming significant scenario restrictions prevalent within traditional analytical models: finite horizon (including non-zero WACC), fixed support costs, and unreliable backup suppliers are essential components for determining the effective optimal disruption mitigation strategy for a given disruption scenario. The second set of case studies demonstrates the importance of proper mitigation strategy selection in real electronic part supply chain scenarios. The results from the case studies not only justified the need for a simulation-based approach to disruption modeling, but also helped to cement the simulation model as an effective decision making tool for electronic part distributors...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a two-period model of repeated franchise bidding or <b>second</b> <b>sourcing.</b> A regulator contracts {{with a single}} firm in each period, presumably because of increasing returns to scale. The incumbent firm invests in the first period. The investment may be transferable to a second source or not; and may be monetary or in human capital. Each firm has private information about its intrinsic efficiency, and, if it is selected to produce. about the cost-reducing effort it exerts and the investment it makes. The regulator, however, observes the firm's realized cost {{at the end of}} the period (the cost includes monetary investments and may be random). In the second period the incumbent firm can be replaced by an entrant. The regulator commits to an optimal breakout rule. The paper generalizes an earlier result that the optimal policy is to regulate through contracts linear in cost overruns. It also derives conclusions concerning the intertemporal evolution of incentive schemes. Mainly, it puts emphasis on the issue of bidding parity. It shows that three basic effects guide the optimal bias in the second-period auctioning process and determines whether the incumbent should be favored depending on the nature of investments. The outcome of the analysis is a relatively pessimistic assessment of the desirability of <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> when sizeable investments are at stake. Last we reinterpret the second source as a raider, and the breakout as a takeover. We discuss the desirability of defensive tactics, and obtain some relationships between the size of managerial stock options, the amount of defensive tactics, the firm's performance and the probability of a takeover.

40|$|With the {{installation}} of a new Private Branch Exchange (PBX), a telephone switch system, the Naval Postgraduate School is looking for the most effective method of sourcing the management, operations, and maintenance functions of the switch system. This thesis examines other organizations that operate a PBX in a campus-like environment. Using the data from these organizations, this thesis creates a decision framework for the NPS PBX sourcing decision using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Separate but linked hierarchies are created for the Management, Operations, and Maintenance functions. The Functional criteria in the AHP include Level of Responsiveness, System Updates, Level of Control, Personnel Expertise, and Cost Factors. These hierarchies {{can be used to}} make a sourcing decision that reflect the priorities and thresholds of acceptable service set by the decision-maker at NPS. Cost data was not available for other organizations, so lull development of the AHP was not possible. Based on the available information, this thesis recommends that NPS should source its PBX management, maintenance and operations initially through a mix of in-house and contractor functions, track costs and other service expectations, and make a <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> decision at a later date.
