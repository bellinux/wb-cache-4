5|$|During his presidency, Wałęsa saw Poland through {{privatization}} and {{transition to a}} free-market economy (the Balcerowicz Plan), Poland's 1991 first completely free parliamentary elections, and a period of redefinition of the country's foreign relations. He successfully negotiated the withdrawal of <b>Soviet</b> <b>troops</b> from Poland and won a substantial reduction in foreign debts.|$|E

50|$|Contrary {{to common}} belief, the <b>Soviet</b> <b>troop</b> {{transfer}} rights by railway to the Hanko base were not granted {{in the peace}} treaty, but they were demanded first on 9 July, after Sweden had acknowledged railway transit of Wehrmacht troops to occupied Norway.|$|R
5|$|In 1944 and 1945, as the German {{situation}} deteriorated, {{provision of}} food to POW camps became more sporadic and starvation became a problem. As <b>Soviet</b> <b>troops</b> advanced westwards, camps in the east were evacuated and moved on foot, in so-called death marches, away from the front in extremely poor conditions.|$|E
5|$|In modern Polish historiography the battle's {{outcome is}} seen as a victory, if a very costly one, for the Polish and <b>Soviet</b> <b>troops.</b> As noted by historians such as Wawer and Komorowski, despite the heavy casualties, the Polish–Soviet {{frontline}} was not seriously breached, and thus the German offensive was a failure.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{settlement}} emboldened the Hungarians, {{who decided}} that Moscow could be defied. A mass demonstration in Budapest on 23 October {{turned into a}} popular uprising. In response to the uprising, Hungarian Party leaders installed reformist Premier Imre Nagy. Soviet forces in the city clashed with Hungarians and even fired on demonstrators, with hundreds of both Hungarians and Soviets killed. Nagy called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of <b>Soviet</b> <b>troops,</b> which a Khrushchev-led majority in the Presidium decided to obey, choosing to give the new Hungarian government a chance. Khrushchev assumed that if Moscow announced liberalization in how it dealt with its allies, Nagy would adhere to the alliance with the Soviet Union. However, on 30 October Nagy announced multiparty elections, {{and the next morning}} that Hungary would leave the Warsaw Pact. On 3 November, two members of the Nagy government appeared in Ukraine as the self-proclaimed heads of a provisional government and demanded Soviet intervention, which was forthcoming. The next day, <b>Soviet</b> <b>troops</b> crushed the Hungarian uprising, with a death toll of 4,000 Hungarians and several hundred <b>Soviet</b> <b>troops.</b> Nagy was arrested, and was later executed. Despite the international outrage over the intervention, Khrushchev defended his actions {{for the rest of his}} life. Damage to Soviet foreign relations was severe, and would have been greater were it not for the fortuitous timing of the Suez crisis, which distracted world attention.|$|E

5|$|While <b>Soviet</b> <b>troops</b> were {{advancing}} into Estonia during 1944, about 200Estonian {{oil shale}} specialists were evacuated to Schömberg, Germany, {{to work at}} an oil shale industry there, codenamed Operation Desert (Unternehmen Wüste). Shale oil extraction plants in Estonia were destroyed and mines were ignited or inundated by the retreating Germans. Existing oil shale-fired power stations were also destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Manstein's first {{attack on}} Sevastopol in November failed, and with {{insufficient}} forces left {{for an immediate}} assault, he ordered an investment of the heavily fortified city. By 17 December he launched another offensive, which also failed. On 26 December the <b>Soviet</b> <b>troops</b> landed on the Kerch Straits to retake Kerch and its peninsula, and on 30 December executed another landing near Feodosiya. Only a hurried withdrawal from the area, in contravention of Manstein's orders, by the 46th Infantry Division under General Hans Graf von Sponeck prevented a collapse of {{the eastern part of}} the Crimea; the division lost most of its heavy equipment. Manstein cancelled a planned resumption of the attack and sent most of his forces east to destroy the Soviet bridgehead. The Soviet forces were in a superior position regarding men and materiel as they were able to re-supply by sea, and were therefore pushed by Stalin to conduct further offensives. However, the <b>Soviet</b> <b>troops</b> were unable to capture the critical rail and road access points which would have cut the German lines of supply.|$|E
5|$|On 11 October 1944 {{the city}} was {{captured}} by Romanian and <b>Soviet</b> <b>troops.</b> It was formally restored to the Kingdom of Romania by the Treaty of Paris in 1947. On 24 January 6 March and 10 May 1946, the Romanian students, who {{had come back to}} Cluj after the restoration of northern Transylvania, rose against the claims of autonomy made by nostalgic Hungarians and the new way of life imposed by the Soviets, resulting in clashes and street fights.|$|E

5|$|As <b>Soviet</b> <b>troops</b> {{approached}} Auschwitz in January 1945, most of {{its population}} was sent west on a death march. The prisoners remaining at the camp were liberated on 27 January 1945, a day now commemorated as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. In the following decades, survivors, such as Primo Levi, Viktor Frankl, and Elie Wiesel, wrote memoirs of their experiences in Auschwitz, and the camp became a dominant symbol of the Holocaust. In 1947, Poland founded the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum {{on the site of}} Auschwitz I and II, and in 1979, it was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.|$|E
