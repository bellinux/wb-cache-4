40|$|In {{a process}} for {{manufacturing}} a singles ring yarn, firstly a first twist is supplied to a strand of traveling drafted fibers at a false twist device for producing a preliminary <b>singles</b> <b>yarn.</b> The false twist device rotates at a first speed for twisting the fibers. Immediately after the first twisting step, a joint twist of a second twist {{in the same direction}} as the first twist and a third twist in a reversed direction is supplied to the preliminary yarn for producing a final singles ring yarn. The second twist is produced by a rotatable take-up package onto which the final <b>singles</b> <b>yarn</b> is drawn. The reversed twist results in correspondence to the first twist, and the take-up package rotates at a second speed. The final <b>singles</b> <b>yarn</b> is then drawn onto the take-up package. Furthermore, a ratio of the first speed to the second speed is controlled for controlling the amount of a residual torque in the final singles ring yarn.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} behavior, {{including the}} tensile and torsional properties, of bulky wool <b>singles</b> <b>yarn,</b> {{which has an}} initial fiber packing density that is non-uniform along yarn radial direction, is modeled in this paper. The theoretical analysis is based on discrete-fiber-modeling principles by which the yarn is considered as an assembly {{of a large number}} of discrete fibers. The movement of fibers during deformation and their final positions after deformation are determined by their need to minimize tensile strain, which is the so-called the shortest-path hypothesis. Energy method is employed to calculate the applied force. Taking the nonlinear behavior of fiber at large strain into account, the contributions to yarn external force due to fiber tension, fiber bending and fiber torsion can all be derived. Comparing with the experimental data, our theoretical model gives a reasonably accurate prediction of yarn behavior at small deformation. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates a {{multispectral}} imaging {{approach to}} colour measurement and colour matching of <b>single</b> <b>yarns.</b> The {{small size of}} a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> {{makes it impossible for}} spectrophotometers directly to acquire its spectral reflectance.

40|$|Yarn {{structure}} {{plays an}} important role in determining the properties of spun yarns. Recently, a modified spinning technique has been developed for producing a low torque and soft handle <b>singles</b> <b>yarn</b> by modifying the fiber arrangement in a yarn. Comparative studies revealed that the finer modified yarns possess significantly higher strength and lower hairiness over the conventional yarns of the same twist level, implying a different structure of finer modified yarn. Thus this paper aims to quantitatively study the structures of the finer conventional and modified cotton yarn (80 Ne) produced at the same twist level. Various measuring techniques, namely the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), cross section technique and tracer fiber technique, are adopted to analyze their structural characteristics, including fiber configuration, fiber spatial orientation angle, fiber packing density, yarn surface appearance, and fiber migration behavior. Results showed that finer modified yarns exhibit a smoother surface and much more compact structure with less hairiness. The fibers in the finer modified yarn have a complicated fiber path with relatively lower fiber radial position, larger migration frequency and magnitudes. In addition, it was noted that 73 % of fibers in the finer conventional yarn follow concentric conical helix, which is contrary to those in the coarser conventional yarn. The analyses conducted in this paper provide deep insights into the mechanism of modified spinning technique and evidential explanations on the difference of properties between the finer conventional and modified yarns.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out into the twist blockage which may occur when yarns pass over guides or other surfaces. The influence of primary physical parameters such as surface curvature, are and length of contact, yarn twist level and tension and yarn/surface friction have been investigated together with secondary parameters such as yarn surface, pressure, angle of approach etc. As a result of these investigations, three mechanisms of blockage have been identified. The first of these occurs especially with doubled yarn in which the components lie {{side by side on the}} guide surface and blocked twist builds up until sufficient torque is developed to turn the yarn over against the couple generated by the components of yarn tension and reaction on the guide surface. In the second mechanism blocking torque is generated by components of friction on the yarn surface at right angles to the yarn axis. These orthogonal friction components may arise from interaction between the topography of the twisted yarn surface and the guide surface or may be generated by forces arising from an angular orientation of yarn to guide. The third mechanism is intermediate between the other two where a <b>singles</b> <b>yarn</b> (or its equivalent) is flattened on the surface and resistance to twist transmission is generated partly by internal friction within the yarn and partly by yarn/guide frictional forces.

40|$|Solospun is a {{spinning}} technology which provides {{the means to}} produce a <b>singles</b> <b>yarn</b> that can be successfully woven as either warp or weft. The technology is a versatile and cost effective alternative to two-folding, Sirospun or sizing. It offers significant benefits in terms of efficiency and productivity. Solospun is a simple, inexpensive, clip-on attachment for the spinning of long staple, weavable singles yarns. The technology {{is the result of}} a joint development between CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology, The Woolmark Company and WRONZ and was commercially released in 1998. It is now successfully operating in worsted mills worldwide. The Solospun hardware consists of a pair of rollers held in a bracket, which is clipped onto the front of the pendulum-drafting arm. Each roller is positioned immediately below, and parallel to, each top front draft roller where it interacts with the emerging drafted fibre strand before twist insertion. The roller-fibre interaction subtly changes the structure of the yarn, which dramatically increases its abrasion resistance. This allows Solospun yarns to be woven without two-folding or sizing, providing significant cost savings. Depending on fabric structure, weaving performance is equivalent to that of conventional two-fold yarns. Fabrics woven from Solospun yarns are of good quality and appearance. Some aspects, including preferred hand and FAST results, are equal or superior to two-fold yarn fabrics. As with compact and condensed spinning, Solospun offers significant reductions in yarn hairiness. However, Solospun can be simply implemented on existing spinning frames and goes much further by making the singles yarns weavable...|$|E

H 577 P ITC 2015 Luoxxv, 211 leaves :color illustrations; 30 cmCommercial spectrophotometers {{and current}} {{state-of-the-art}} digital camera imaging systems {{are unable to}} measure the spectral reflectance of yarn dyed fabrics, the former can only measure the average reflectance of an area and the latter can only measure the tristimulus values derived from the camera's RGB responses. Multispectral imaging systems, on the other hand, {{have the potential to}} measure the reflectance of a multi-colour object, such as yarn dyed fabrics, since they can record both of the spectral and spatial information of a sample. In this thesis, colour measurement of yarn dyed fabrics based on the multispectral imaging technique is studied. The major factor restraining multispectral imaging systems from application in textile is the difficulty of correlation the measurement results of a yarn dyed fabric to the true colours of the yarns. The spectral response of multispectral imaging systems to yarn dyed fabrics is dramatically affected by irregular 3 D shapes of yarns, inter-reflection between neighbouring yarns, and interstices between weft and warp yarns. In this thesis, a novel reflection model is first proposed to estimate the interaction between light and a yarn dyed fabric surface. Surface texture, illumination occlusion and inter-reflection are taken into account. The reflection model is then verified by reducing the influence of texture on spectrophotometric colour. Derived from the proposed reflection model, reflectance and tristimulus values of yarn dyed fabrics with different texture structures are linear. The linear relationship in the reflectance space can be used to estimate a theoretical reflectance which discounts the influence of texture. Experimental results show that the impact of texture on colour for yarn dyed fabric samples in four colour centres and twenty-one texture structures can be reduced by 79 %, 55 %, 71 % and 57 %, respectively. Based on the proposed reflection model, multispectral imaging colour measurement of yarn dyed fabrics are achieved through a series of image processing techniques, namely, colour region segmentation, solid-colour and multi-colour region detection, and weft and warp yarn segmentation. Firstly, a yarn dyed fabric image is partitioned into dominant colour regions by a Gaussian model. The Gaussian model is used to reconstruct the CIELAB colour histograms of dominant colour regions from those of yarns. A hierarchical segmentation structure is then devised to obtain dominant colour regions by combining histogram segmentation results in three colour channels. Experimental results shows the proposed approach has excellent performance for dominant colour region segmentation with high computational efficiency. Secondly, a dominant colour region is detected as solid-colour or multi-colour by CIExyY histogram distributions. Derived from the proposed reflection model, the CIExyY histogram of a multi-colour yarn dyed fabric accords with a combination of two Gaussian distributions, whereas for that of a solid-colour yarn dyed fabric, it correlated to one Gaussian distribution. Experiments on real yarn dyed fabric samples demonstrate that solid-colour and multi-colour yarn dyed fabric regions can be distinguished in terms of CIExyY histogram distribution. Finally, a multi-colour yarn dyed fabric is segmented to weft and warp yarns by a modified K-means clustering method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can segment weft and warp yarns in yarn dyed fabric images, with both high segmentation accuracy and fast processing speed. In addition, the proposed reflection model can be utilized to accomplish multispectral imaging colour measurement of <b>single</b> <b>yarns.</b> <b>Single</b> <b>yarns</b> are the elemental weaving components of yarn dyed fabrics and have much simpler structures. The multispectral imaging colour of a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> is not affected by surface texture and inter-reflection. The colour measurement of <b>single</b> <b>yarns</b> is achieved by two steps. Firstly, a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> is segmented from backgrounds by an image difference method. Secondly, the reflectance of a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> can be specified by different weighting methods. Experimental results show that multispectral imaging colour measurement of <b>single</b> <b>yarns</b> can achieve a repeatability of 0. 1185 CMC(2 : 1) units and a spatial reproducibility of 0. 2827 CMC(2 : 1) units. Experimental results also show that <b>single</b> <b>yarns</b> measured by multispectral imaging systems can accomplish the similar colour matching results as solid-colour yarn dyed fabrics measured by spectrophotometers. Finally, an optical-based approach is proposed to explore the relation between the multispectral imaging colour of a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> and the spectrophotometric colour of the corresponding yarn card. A colour mapping equation between the <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> and corresponding yarn card can be then found by the simplex optimal method. Experimental results show that colour difference between <b>single</b> <b>yarns</b> and corresponding yarn cards reduces from 2. 97 to 1. 20 CMC(2 : 1) units for 50 pairs of training samples and from 3. 09 to 1. 37 CMC(2 : 1) units for 50 pairs of testing samples.
