It featured 8 MB {{of memory and}} ran Linux 2.2. The device was later upgraded with an accelerometer, vibrating mechanism, and fingerprint sensor. IBM began to collaborate with Citizen Watch Co. to create the [...] "WatchPad". The WatchPad 1.5 features a 320 × 240 QVGA monochrome touch <b>sensitive</b> <b>display</b> and runs Linux 2.4. It also features calendar software, Bluetooth, 8 MB of RAM and 16 MB of flash memory. Citizen was hoping to market the watch to students and businessmen, with a retail price of around $399. Epson Seiko introduced their Chrono-bit wristwatch in September 2000. The Chrono-bit watches feature a rotating bezel for data input, synchronize PIM data via a serial cable, and can load custom watch faces.|$|E

5000|$|The program {{displayed}} a two dimensional shape (a [...] "biomorph") {{made up of}} straight black lines, the length, position, and angle of which were defined by a simple set of rules and instructions (analogous to a genome). Adding new lines (or removing them) based on these rules offered a discrete set of possible new shapes (mutations), which were displayed on screen so that the user could choose between them. The chosen mutation would then {{be the basis for}} another generation of biomorph mutants to be chosen from, and so on. Thus, the user, by selection, could steer the evolution of biomorphs. This process often produced images which were reminiscent of real organisms for instance beetles, bats, or trees. Dawkins speculated that the unnatural selection role played by the user in this program could be replaced by a more natural agent if, for example, colourful biomorphs could be selected by butterflies or other insects, via a touch <b>sensitive</b> <b>display</b> set up in a garden.|$|E

In the classroom, the lecturer writes on a wide, pen <b>sensitive</b> <b>display.</b> The system tracks all actions and {{makes it possible for}} the lecture to be replayed from the web any time. The remote viewer can follow the progress of the lecture: Audio, the creation of the board content, and an optional video image of the instructor is transmitted. In addition to usual drawing functionality the board can handle a range of multimedia elements from the Internet. The board can integrate all kinds of modules, invoked by board drawings. One of these modules is described here: A computer algebra system that evaluates mathematical expressions or plots functions is placed at the lecturers disposal by a handwriting recognition. ...|$|E

Remote students follow the lecture looking at the dynamic board content and listening to the recorded voice of the instructor. In addition to drawings, the new chalkboard handles a range of multimedia elements from the Internet. Using handwriting recognition, mathematical expressions can be evaluated and functions can be plotted immediately on the board. Since the first release in early 2002, we have gained practical experiences with different use cases and scenarios which we present in this paper. ...|$|E
40|$|CIRRIN [3] is a stylus based text input {{technique}} for mobile devices {{with a touch}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>display.</b> In this paper we explore the benefit of expanding the letters of CIRRIN to reduce the overall difficulty of selecting a letter. We adapted the existing CIRRIN to expand the characters as the stylus approached it {{to create a new}} text entry technique called expanding CIRRIN. In a small user study we compared the standard CIRRIN and expanding CIRRIN for different sentences. Our results indicate that expanding CIRRIN increases error rates and text input times. We observed that expanding the letters often made the stylus enter the CIRRIN ring adjacent to the intended letter, thereby increasing error rates. We discuss the implications of these results, and possible applications of expanding targets with other text input techniques such as the Metropolis [7] soft keyboard...|$|E

40|$|The size {{of human}} fingers {{and the lack}} of sensing {{precision}} can make precise touch screen interactions difficult. We present a set of five techniques, called Dual Finger Selections, which leverage the recent development of multitouch <b>sensitive</b> <b>displays</b> to help users select very small targets. These techniques facilitate pixel-accurate targeting by adjusting the control-display ratio with a secondary finger while the primary finger controls the movement of the cursor. We also contribute a “clicking ” technique, called SimPress, which reduces motion errors during clicking and allows us to simulate a hover state on devices unable to sense proximity. We implemented our techniques on a multi-touch tabletop prototype that offers computer visionbased tracking. In our formal user study, we tested the performance of our three most promising techniques (Stretch, X-Menu, and Slider) against our baseline (Offset), on four target sizes and three input noise levels. All three chosen techniques outperformed the control technique in terms of error rate reduction and were preferred by our participants, with Stretch being the overall performance and preference winner.

40|$|The {{creation}} of a European criminal law code is a complex and, {{to a certain extent}} unpopular issue. It is complex because it suggests harmonisation of national substantial and procedural criminal law systems and unpopular amongst Member States because indeed harmonisation of criminal law is utterly <b>sensitive,</b> <b>displaying</b> one of the last corners of Member States’ sovereignty. The Lisbon Treaty has provided the European Union (EU) with new competences in the area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and law enforcement cooperation as this area has now become an area of shared competences with the Member States. Two important questions arise from these new competences. First, does the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide the means for further harmonisation? Second, will this harmonisation lead legislators to create a European Criminal Code and a European Criminal Procedural Code? This article will discuss the issue of harmonisation and then provide elements of answer to the second question through the angle of the possible setting up of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office...|$|R
40|$|Context is a {{key issue}} in {{interaction}} between human and computer, describing the surrounding facts that add meaning. In mobile computing research published the parameter location is most often used to approximate context and to implement context-aware applications. We propose that ultra-mobile computing, characterized by devices that are operational and operated {{while on the move}} (e. g. PDAs, mobile phones, wearable computers), can significantly benefit from a wider notion of context. To structure the field we introduce a working model for context, discuss mechanisms to acquire context beyond location, and application of context-awareness in ultra-mobile computing. We investigate the utility of sensors for context-awareness and present two prototypical implementations - a light <b>sensitive</b> <b>display</b> and an orientation aware PDA interface. The concept is then extended to a model for sensor fusion to enable more sophisticated context recognition. Based on an implementation of the model an exp [...] ...|$|E

In particular, many existing work (Li et al. 2014; Enck et al. 2010; Lu et al. 2015; Rastogi et al. 2013) studies the security topics on predefined sensitive data sources. For example, one can track the privacy disclosures of sensitive user inputs to different sinks with proper static or dynamic taint analysis. With static program analysis, one can also find the vulnerabilities in mobile applications that may disclosure sensitive user inputs to public or attacker controlled output. Secure display and input (Li et al. 2014) provides an end-to-end channel that ensures <b>sensitive</b> <b>display</b> and input can never be accessed by untrusted Android drivers.|$|E

40|$|Although display {{devices have}} been used for decades, they have functioned without taking into account the {{illumination}} of their environment. We present the concept of a lighting <b>sensitive</b> <b>display</b> (LSD) – a display that measures the incident illumination and modifies its content accordingly. An ideal LSD would be able to measure the 4 D illumination field incident upon it and generate a 4 D light field in response to the illumination. However, current sensing and display technologies do not allow for such an ideal implementation. Our initial prototype of the LSD uses a 2 D measurement of the illumination field and produces a 2 D image in response to it. In particular, it renders a 3 D scene such that it always appears to be lit by the real environment that the display resides in. The current system is designed to perform best when the light sources in the environment are distant from the display, and a single user in a known location views the display. The displayed scene is represented by compressing a very large set of images (acquired or rendered) of the scene that correspond to different lighting conditions. The compression algorithm is a lossy one that exploits not only image correlations over the illumination dimensions but also coherences over the spatial dimensions of the image. This results in a highly compresse...|$|E
30|$|Since the {{development}} of mobile communications and the dissemination of mobile devices have rapidly grown and the services based on mobility have been increased, the authentication of users or mobile devices in mobile networks is very important. Traditional authentication methods such as the username and password are used in many cases of user authentication by a remote authentication server. But there are drawbacks to using password-based authentication. For example, the authentication system requires long and complex passwords to prevent attackers from cracking or guessing them. In addition, {{it makes it more}} difficult for users to recall their passwords. This raises the possibility that the users will not manage their passwords securely and may easily reveal them to attackers. There are lots of password threats, such as password capturing, password guessing, password cracking, and password replacing [8]. The move to a system of password-free login using biometric authenticators is being accelerated through standardization by the FIDO Alliance. Recently, the ARM TrustZone-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) was designed to deliver enhanced security from scalable software attacks and common hardware attacks at a lower cost to the market, and to provide solutions for the FIDO security requirements, such as to ensure the integrity of the device, to keep key material confidential from unauthorized access, to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive processes, to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive input data, and to protect <b>sensitive</b> <b>display</b> data [9].|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether extracellular matrix (ECM) composition through integrin receptors modulated the volume-sensitive osmolyte anion channels (VSOACs) in skeletal muscle-derived C 2 C 12 cells. Cl− currents were recorded in whole cell voltage-clamped cells grown on laminin (LM), fibronectin (FN), or in the absence of a defined ECM (NM). Basal membrane currents recorded in isotonic media (300 mosmol/kg) were larger in cells grown on FN (3. 8 -fold at + 100 mV) or LM (8. 8 -fold at + 100 mV) when compared with NM. VSOAC currents activated by cell exposure to hypotonic solution were larger in cells grown on LM (1. 72 -fold at + 100 mV) or FN (1. 75 -fold at + 100 mV) compared with NM. Additionally, the kinetics of VSOAC activation was ≈ 27 % quicker on FN and LM. These currents were tamoxifen <b>sensitive,</b> <b>displayed</b> outward rectification, reversed at the equilibrium potential of Cl− and inactivated at potentials >+ 60 mV. Specific knockdown of β 1 -integrin by short hairpin RNA interference strongly inhibited the VSOAC Cl− currents in cells plated on FN.

"New" tourists however, are increasingly being seen to be environmentally <b>sensitive,</b> <b>displaying</b> respect for the culture of host nations and looking to experience and learn rather than merely stand back and gaze. "New" tourists are participators not spectators. Things that would never appear on the list of the "mass" tourist such as adventure, getting of the beaten track and mingling with the locals are now the foundations of the new tourist experiences. Responding to the shift in market dynamics towards a "New" style of tourist, a number of initiatives have or are likely to fuel the growth of experiential tourism, these include: network tourism initiatives; the development of interpretive highways; the explosion of interpretive centers;the latest trend towards regional base camps. A new era has arrived, and a new kind of tourism is emerging, sustainable, environmentally and socially responsible, and characterized by flexibility and choice. A new type of tourist is driving it: more educated, experienced, independent, conservation-minded, respectful of cultures, and insistent on value for money. Typically these tourists are turning away from travel and prefer to have a high level of involvement in the organisation of their trip. ...|$|R
