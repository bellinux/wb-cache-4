Objectives: In chronic prostatitis there are many causes that may provoke a thera-peutical failure of a systemic antibiotic treatment. At the moment a consensus has not been reached on {{the efficacy of the}} many therapeutical options that are available with not one of these approaches being efficacious in all patients. In our view the main cau-ses of treatment failure are the well-known hurdle to antibiotic diffusion inside the glandular parenchyma associated with the so-called intraprostatic bacterial biofilms and the possible presence of local auto-immune reactions. Given this background we tested ultrasound guided intra-prostate infiltration of a cocktail of antibiotics and betamethazone, for a thera-peutical options. Material and Methods: 320 patients, referred to us because of symptoms indi-cative of chronic prostatitis, were enrolled in this study.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{evaluated}} circadian urine {{production and}} its determinants {{in a large}} population based sample of older men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data on 1, 688 men 50 to 78 years old, without radical prostatectomy, prostate or bladder cancer, neurogenic bladder disease or negative advice from their general practitioner, recruited from the population of Krimpen, the Netherlands. Measurements consisted of self-administered questionnaires, including the International Prostate Symptom Score, a 3 -day frequency-volume chart, transrectal <b>prostatic</b> <b>ultrasound,</b> uroflowmetry and post-void residual volume. Hourly urine production was determined and urine production day-to-night ratio was calculated from the frequency-volume chart. RESULTS: Men younger than 65 years showed a clear circadian urine production pattern, whereas in older men this pattern was less clear. Smoking, use of diuretic drugs, post-void residual and 24 -hour polyuria reinforced the circadian pattern, in favor of daytime urine production. The urine production day-to-night ratio {{was not associated with}} prostate enlargement, reduced urinary flow rate, body weight, hypertension, cardiac symptoms, diabetes mellitus, use of antidepressants, cardiac or hypnotic drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Urine production in men younger than 65 years showed a clear circadian pattern in contrast to men older than 65 years. These data {{can be used as a}} reference when describing urine production patterns in select populations. In daily practice frequency-volume charts can be used to determine urine production. This method is inexpensive, easy to use and provides valid information on urine production in a natural environment...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{investigated}} an algorithm {{to detect}} grey level transitions with multiple scales of resolution to improve edge detection and localisation in ultrasound {{images of the}} prostate. INTRODUCTION: We had developed a non-analytical operator for prostate contour determination implemented with minimum and maximum filters and locate edges. We implemented a technique for improved determination of boundary parts in <b>prostatic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> images by adjusting the edge detection parameter to signal information. METHODS: First the influence of prefilter settings and edge detection parameters is investigated in a test image and a real ultrasound image. Then, local standard deviation is used to identify or fewer homogeneous regions that are filtered with course resolution, while areas with larger deviation that grey level transitions occur, which should be preserved using smaller filter sizes to improve edge localisation. RESULTS: Analysis of images with different filter sizes indicated that areas are merged for increasing filter sizes: less pronounced edges disappear or displace for larger filters. Two scales of resolution lead to an improved localisation of edges when smaller filter sizes are used in areas with an increased local standard deviation. CONCLUSIONS: This paper illustrates an edge detection method suitable as pre-processing step in interpretation of medical images. By adapting input parameters to signal information, object recognition can be applied in images from different imaging modalities. Also, disadvantages are discussed, resulting in a new application combining a localisation algorithm to find the initial contour and a delineation algorithm to improve the outlining of the resulting contou...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of an obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts, {{in spite of}} its rarity, must be considered by the Urologists in the screening of the etiologic causes of obstructive azoospermia. Nowadays, the diagnostic approach, which includes the biochemical study of seminal plasma and <b>prostatic</b> <b>ultrasound,</b> often leads to the preoperative recognition of the site of obstruction. Various surgical and endoscopic techniques have been adopted for the treatment of ejaculatory duct obstructions in different historical periods. Herein we describe our experience that starts from 1979. 17 infertile patients with intraprostatic cysts and 2 with a stenosis of the veru montanum were treated by us following these criteria: 9 azoospermic patients underwent scrototomy and endoscopy; 10 patients with a severe oligozoospermia underwent echo-guided puncture of an intraprostatic cyst. The patients were placed in the lithotomy position, a 16 G needle was adopted and by means ultrasound was possible to follow the needle entering the cyst. When no spermatozoa was detected in the cystic liquid, sclerosing agents (Sodium-tetradecyl-sulphate 30 mg in 1 l.) was introduced. This easy procedure was carried out on outpatients in local anaesthesia. One out of ten oligozoospermic patients had to repeat the echo-guided puncture of intraprostatic cyst as the first attempt had been followed by recurrence. Eight out of ten subfertile patients who had undergone percutaneous echo-guided treatment had longer than 1 year follow-up: in seven cases an increase in sperms number and motility was obtained; in one case sperm count remained unmodified.

40|$|Kidney {{ultrasound}} {{is one of}} {{the basic}} procedures in the practice of a urologist. Apart from the location and the size, description of renal morphology should contain the thickness of the anterior lip parenchyma in a transverse section and the location of possible narrowings. Uneven outline of the kidney is a sign of past inflammatory conditions. In the case of the pelvicalyceal system dilation, it is advised to specify the dimensions of the pelvis and calyces. Convex shape of the calyces proves elevated pressure within the pelvicalyceal system. Hydronephrosis is present when urinary retention has led to thinning the renal parenchyma. In each case, one should identify the reason for urinary retention in the upper urinary tract. Urinary retention on both sides requires one to exclude urinary bladder tumor, it may also be caused by a benign <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia. <b>Ultrasound</b> examination is a sensitive method of renal stones detection, regardless of their chemical composition. Cyst description in an ultrasound image should cover its morphological features, differentiating between the so-called simple or complex cysts. In the case of a solid lesion, ultrasound makes it possible to detect parenchymal lesions usually starting with the size of 2 – 2. 5 cm. It enables one to particularly diagnose angiomyolipomas. As regards the remaining parenchymal lesions, differentiation of the lesion nature is impossible. In some cases of angiomyolipoma, when it contains bleeding areas present and when it is deficient in adipose tissue, it resembles adenocarcinoma. It is necessary that the description includes the exact location, especially the dimensions and relation of the tumor to the renal sinus.

Clinical and Doppler ultrasound examinations revealed moderate ED in 34 study group patients who had received combined treatment with sildenafil and the DS Erectogenon for 4 weeks. In the same perod, 21 patients from a comparative group (Group 2)  had taken sildenafil only and 20 patients from a comparative group (Group 3) had used the natural biocomplex DS Erectogenon only.  The investigation revealed mild ED in the patients from Groups 2 and 3. The immediate and late treatment results were assessed 4 and 12  weeks {{after the end of}} treatment, respectively. Combined therapy with sildenafil + Erectogenon was found to statistically significantly enhance its efficiency and to improve quality of sexual life in 85. 3 % of the study group patients who had moderate ED. This patient group had a more marked positive clinical effect (a mean increase in erection quality by 7. 0 scores by the International Index of Erectile Function, a rise in penile blood flow by 3. 5 times, and a reduction in the International Prostatitis Symptom Index by 5 scores). Sildenafiil-C 3 or Erectogenon monotherapy provided a lower effect in the comparative groups. The findings confirm that combined therapy with the Russian drugs sildenafil-C 3 and DS Erectogenon is effective, safe, and well-compatible and causes no adverse reactions and the synergism of the components of the biocomplex DS Erectogenon prolongs the effect of daily low-dose sildenafil. The combined treatment may be recommended for the treatment of ED in patients with BPH, for this affects the pathogenesis of the disease, alleviates the progression of ED, and improves their quality of life.

Aim: To assess the prevalence of prostate cancer in the Seventh Region of Chile. Material and methods: A probabilistic sample of 327 males aged 40 to 59 years old was studied. In all, a codified questionnaire was applied, a digital rectal examination was performed and a blood sample was drawn to measure prostate specific antigen. All digital rectal examinations were performed by the same observer. Patients with an abnormal rectal examination or prostate specific antigen were subjected to a <b>prostatic</b> biopsy under <b>ultrasound</b> guidance.

Research work has been on-going to assess if there are other better tests suitable for primary or secondary screening of PCa to supplement the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, which fails to work accurately in a grey zone of 4 - 10 ng/ml. In this pilot study, the potential roles of urinary polyamines as prostate cancer biomarkers were evaluated. PCa, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients and healthy controls (HC) showing PSA> 4. 0 ng/ml {{were enrolled in the}} study. Their urine samples were obtained, and the urinary levels of putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) were determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and Student's t-test were used to evaluate their diagnostic accuracies. Among the three biogenic polyamines, Spm had demonstrated a good diagnostic performance when comparing their levels in PCa patients with BPH patients (1. 47 in PCa vs 5. 87 in BPH; p< 0. 0001).

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the risk of}} prostate cancer (PCa) on a third prostate biopsy {{in a group of}} patients with two consecutive diagnoses of high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). Materials and methods: From November 2004 to December 2007, patients referred to our clinic with a PSA ! 4 ng/ml or an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) were scheduled for trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided 12 -core prostate biopsy. Patients with HGPIN underwent a second prostate biopsy, and if the results of such procedure yielded a second diagnosis of HGPIN, we proposed a third 12 -core needle biopsy regardless of PSA value. Crude and adjusted logistic regressions were used to assess predictors of PCa on the third biopsy. Results: A total of 650 patients underwent 12 cores transrectal <b>ultrasound</b> <b>prostatic</b> biopsy in the study period. Of 147 (22 %) men with a diagnosis of HGPIN, 117 underwent a second prostatic biopsy after six months and 43 a third biopsy after other six months. After the third biopsy, 19 patients (34 %) still showed HGPIN, 15 (35 %) were diagnosed with PCa and 9 (21 %) presented with chronic prostatitis. Widespread HGPIN on a second biopsy was significantly associated with PCa on further biopsy (! 2 = 4. 04, p = 0. 04). Moreover, the presence of widespread HGPIN significantly predicted the risk of PCa on crude and adjusted logistic regressions. Conclusions: Widespread HGPIN on second biopsy is associated with the presence of PCa on a third biopsy. Nonetheless, the relationship between HGPIN and PCa remains complex and further studies are needed to confirm our findings...|$|R
40|$|Dear Editors, We {{read with}} {{interest}} the article by Di Franco and co-workers (1). The introduction of prostatic magnetic resonance and the relative fusion-biopsy have not yet allowed the expected improvements in prostate biopsy. To our knowledge, there are no works that demonstrate the superiority of fusion techniques on the remaining ultrasound guided prostate biopsies that are still the widely used in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Furthemore, these technologies are expensive exams {{and they are not}} yet available in all centers, especially in those minors. We work at a “minor” center and we always {{keep in mind that the}} goal of  prostatic biopsy is the diagnosis and the staging of prostatic neoplasms [...] However, it remains uncertain which of the two techniques, transperineal (TP) or transrectal (TR), is superior in terms of detection rate during first biopsy setting. Several studies have compared the prostate cancer detection rate but TR and TP access route in prostatic gland sampling seems to be equivalent in terms of efficiency and complications, as reported by Shen PF et al. (2), despite several methodological limitations recognized in their work. The results reported by Di Franco CA et al. represent the real life experience of most urologists that perform the PB based on their own training experience and available technical devices. From an historical viewpoint, the TP route has been the first one to be used to reach the prostate, both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. To date, because it seems to be more invasive and difficult, the TP route is less used worldwide than the TR one (2). Theoretically, the TP approach should detect more prostate cancer than the TR way   because the cores of the TP approach are directed longitudinally to the peripheral zone and the anterior part of the prostate (4). The results reported by Di Franco et al. seems to confirm these considerations. However, our real life experience differ from the conclusions reached in their work. We recently conducted a prospective evaluation of 352 patients who underwent their first prostate biopsy because of a suspicious of prostate cancer (elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination and/or abnormal findings on transrectal <b>prostatic</b> <b>ultrasound).</b> Patients was randomized as following. A total of 187 patients (Group A) underwent a prostatic biopsy with a transperineal approach in a lithotomic position,  using a biplane probe (8818 BK Medical, Denmark) and a fan technique with a single perineal median access (5). The remnants 165 patients (Group B) underwent a transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy in a left lateral position, using a end fire probe configuration (8818 BK Medical, Denmark) and a sagittal technique. The bioptic prostatic mapping was performed with a 12 -core scheme sec. Gore (3) by a single experienced operator and the histopathologic evaluation was performed by a single dedicated uro-pathologist. Statistical evaluations were made with a T Student test  (p< 0, 005). Group A and Group B was similar in term of mean patient age (67, 9 years and 67 years respectively), mean total PSA (12, 1 ng/ml vs 12 ng/ml) and digital rectal examination positivity (22 % vs 29 %).   The global cancer detection rate was 33, 69 % (63 / 187) in the transperineal prostate biopsy group and 48, 48 % (80 / 165) in the transrectal approach (p= 0. 0047).   No significant statistical differences were found in the complications rates between the two groups. Statistical evaluation of site of tumor localization reveal only a trend to statistical significance in apical site tumors diagnosed with the TR approach versus the TP technique. The TR approach had a better diagnostic accuracy than TP technique in case of PSA< 4 ng/ml, intermediate prostate volume (30 and 50 ml), normal digital rectal examination without any relationship with the patient age. In our experience, two aspect may explain the difference between the two group in term of global detection rate. First, we usually perform transrectal biopsy with a sagittal technique that simulates the transperineal way of needle incidence with the prostatic gland. The lateral and anterior gland portions may be sampled more accurately. Second, our transperineal approach consists in a single perineal median access that can make more difficult the gland sampling between the two lobes. However, there was no significant difference in core positivity rate at the peripheral zone, medium gland, apex or any other site such as reported in many randomized clinical trials (2). Unlike the conclusions reported by Di Franco et al., in our experience we found a statistically significant difference between the TR and TP approach, at the first biopsy setting, in term of global cancer detection rate. No differences were found in terms of complications. Moreover, our data suggest that TR approach had a better diagnostic accuracy than TP technique in case of  PSA< 4 ng/ml, prostate volume 30 - 50 ml, normal digital rectal examination without any relationship with the patient age. The further step of the statistical evaluation of our data will be the definition of the possibility that the TR biopsy determine a better staging of prostate cancer than TP approach as first procedure.       REFERENCES   1)       Di Franco CA, Jallous H., Porru D. et al.
