Having prepared the research plan, a questionnaire was designed based on goals and hypotheses of the research and {{was sent to the}} <b>statistical</b> <b>universe.</b> Also this paper is a field research in terms of data collection. As regards theoretical bases of the research, library data collection method has been applied. So, the required data has been gathered by referring to the related references, books, libraries and so on. To design a questionnaire and gather the opinions of the <b>statistical</b> <b>universe</b> members, field study method and researcher-made questionnaire have been used. The <b>statistical</b> <b>universe</b> comprises nurses and head of ICU and head nurses of Najmieh Hospital in Tehran. The respondents were selected by random sampling method. Also to estimate sample size, Morgan table was applied. The <b>statistical</b> <b>universe</b> consists of 65 members and according to the table, 56 questionnaires were determined for the research. So 60 questionnaires were sent and 58 ones were returned. Face and content validity of the research tool were approved by experts. The test reliability was estimated 0. 777 by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficient. In this paper, factor analysis based on partial least squares structural equations method has been applied to analyze more important factors and coefficients, estimate independent variables coefficients and even determine effectiveness of each independent variable on each other and determine appropriateness of the questions and their coefficients in explaining the related index.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a methodology {{for the construction}} of generalized families of probability distributions in the quantile <b>statistical</b> <b>universe,</b> that is, distributions specified in terms of their quantile functions. The main benefit of the proposed methodology is that it generates quantile-based distributions with skewness-invariant measures of kurtosis. The skewness and kurtosis can therefore be identified and analyzed separately. The key contribution of this thesis is {{the development of a new}} type of the generalized lambda distribution (GLD), using the quantile function of the generalized Pareto distribution as the basic building block (in the literature each different type of the GLD is incorrectly referred to as a parameterization of the GLD – in this thesis the term type is used). The parameters of this new type can, contrary to existing types, easily be estimated with method of L-moments estimation, since closed-form expressions are available for the estimators as well as for their asymptotic standard errors. The parameter space and the shape properties of the new type are discussed in detail, including its characterization through L-moments. A simple estimation algorithm is presented and utilization of the new type in terms of data fitting and approximation of probability distributions is illustrated.

The <b>statistical</b> <b>universe</b> included all the students who were studying at Tehran universities. The samples included 1004 cases that were selected by stratified random sampling. Religious and national identity scale and the revised identity style questionnaire were the devices used in this study. Multiple-variance analysis of variance was applied for the purpose of data analysis. The results of the study indicated that: regarding the three sub-scales of information, normative and commitment identity style, the female group had (got) higher means compared to the male group. This is while the male group showed a higher mean in the sub-scale of diffuse/avoidance; the female group showed a higher mean in all the sub-scales of national and religious identity. On the whole, the present study revealed that all the sub-scales of religiosity, psychological well-being, information, normative and commitment identity, religious and national identity are higher in the female students compared to the male students, whereas the diffuse and avoidance identity was higher in the male students. In general, these findings prove psychological and social disorientation among the male students in comparison to the female group.
