The Sarabau Mine is a gold and antimony mine. Sarabauite {{can be found}} there in mineral veins through altered limestone containing quartz, wollastonite, calcite, stibnite and senarmonite. Both temperature and fluids are responsible for its formation through a two-stage hydrothermal mineralization process. First, wollastonite, diopside, and epidote form at temperatures over 400 °C. In the second stage, at over 377 °C, sarabauite and native gold develop. Calcite, stibnite, and <b>senarmontite</b> also form during the second stage as the mineralization cools further to 377-194 °C.

In this reappraisal, samples of both polymorphs of Sb 2 O 3 (<b>senarmontite</b> and valentinite) have been analysed using X-ray diffraction and simultaneous differential thermal/thermogravimetric analysis techniques. The senarrnontite-valentinite phase transition has been observed to occur as a multi-stage event commencing at temperatures as low as 615 +/- 3 degrees C evidence of oxidation to Sb 2 O 4 under inert atmosphere may indicate that the depression is related to surface- or bulk-bound water.

X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering measurements up to 18 and 25 GPa, respectively, have been complementedwith ab initio total-energy and lattice-dynamics calculations. X-ray diffractionmeasurements {{do not provide}} evidence of a space-group symmetry change in <b>senarmontite</b> up to 18 GPa.

The behavior of the Raman modes with increasing pressure up to 25 GPa is fully reproduced by the lattice-dynamics calculations in cubic Sb 2 O 3. Therefore, the combined analysis of both experiments and lattice-dynamics calculations suggest the occurrence of two isostructural phase transformations at 3. 5 and 10 GPa, respectively. Total-energy calculations show that the isostructural phase transformations occur through local atomic displacements in which <b>senarmontite</b> loses its molecular character to become a three-dimensional solid.

These experiments were performed {{using a new}} X-ray cell which allows simultaneous measurement of the absolute concentration of the absorbing element in the fluid, and atomic environment around the absorber. Results show that aqueous Sb(III) speciation {{is dominated by the}} Sb(OH) 3 ° complex in pure water, mixed Sb-hydroxide-chloride complexes in acidic NaCl HCl solutions (2 m NaCl 0. 1 m HCl), and by Sb-chloride species in concentrated HCl solutions (3. 5 m HCl). Interatomic Sb O and Sb Cl distances in these complexes range from 1. 96 to 1. 97 ? and from 2. 37 to 2. 47 ?, respectively. These structural data, together with <b>senarmontite</b> solubility determined from XAFS spectra, were complemented by batch-reactor measurements of <b>senarmontite</b> and stibnite (Sb 2 S 3, rhombic) solubilities over a wide range of HCl and NaCl concentrations from 300 to 400 °C. Analysis of the whole dataset shows that Sb(III) speciation in high-temperature moderately acid (pH > 2 3) Cl-rich fluids is dominated by mixed hydroxy-chloride species like Sb(OH) 2 Cl° and Sb(OH) 3 Cl?, but other species containing two or three Cl atoms appear at higher acidities and moderate temperatures (? 300 °C). Calculations using stability constants retrieved in this study indicate that mixed hydroxy-chloride complexes control antimony transport in saline high-temperature ore fluids at acidic conditions. Such species allow for a more effective Sb partitioning into the vapor phase during boiling and vapor brine separation processes occurring in magmatic-hydrothermal systems. Antimony hydroxy-chloride complexes are however minor in the neutral low- to moderate-temperature solutions (? 250 300 °C) typical of Sb deposits formation; the antimony speciation in these systems is dominated by Sb(OH) 3 and potentially Sb-sulfide species...|$|E

Reactivity of alpha-Sb 2 O 3 (<b>senarmontite)</b> towards oxidation is significantly enhanced after recirculating its suspension in a magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) system. This inspired the MHD synthesis of a molybdenum-vanadiumantimony mixed oxide with superior catalytic activity for selective partial oxidation of isobutane.

40|$|The {{processes}} {{leading to}} the attenuation of the antimony concentration in the water draining from the abandoned antimony mine in Goesdorf, Luxembourg, have been studied. Antimony has been mined in Goesdorf since Roman times from a stibnite-rich mesothermal vein system hosted in metasedimentary schist. The draining waters have pH values between 7 and 8 because the mineralization itself contains calcite and dolomite. This study combines the identification of minerals in the supergene zone with the application of bulk techniques (e. g., measurement of antimony {{in the waters of}} the adit and the creek draining the mine, sediment sequential extractions) over a period of five years. Antimony concentrations in the water that leaves the supergene zone are controlled by the dissolution of stibnite and the subsequent formation of Sb(III) oxides and sulphates. The relative proportions of the main secondary minerals can be qualitatively estimated as follows: 70 % valentinite, 15 % <b>senarmontite</b> and 12 % sulphates (coquandite, klebelsbergite and peretaite). Further antimony attenuation along the adit and the creek that drain the mine waters is due partly to dilution, through mixing with waters that have not been in contact with the ore, and partly to sorption onto amorphous iron and manganese oxides present in the colluvial sediments...|$|E

Here we report on an in situ measurement, using X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, of antimony speciation and partitioning in the system Sb 2 O 3 -H 2 O-NaCl-HCl at 400 °C and pressures 270 - 300 bar corresponding to the vapour-liquid equilibrium. Experiments were performed using a spectroscopic cell which allows simultaneous determination of the total concentration and atomic environment of the absorbing element (Sb) in each phase. Results show that quantitative vapour-brine separation of a supercritical aqueous salt fluid {{can be achieved by}} a controlled decompression and monitoring the X-ray absorbance of the fluid phase. Antimony concentrations in equilibrium with Sb 2 O 3 (cubic, <b>senarmontite)</b> in the coexisting vapour and liquid phases and corresponding SbIII vapour-liquid partitioning coefficients are in agreement with recent data obtained using batch-reactor solubility techniques. The XAFS spectra analysis shows that hydroxy-chloride complexes, probably Sb(OH) 2 Cl 0, are dominant both in the vapour and liquid phase in a salt-water system at acidic conditions.

40|$|The {{second part}} of a {{literature}} review on the deportment of trace toxic elements in gold processing by cyanidation is presented. Part 1 of this review collated the relevant information on trace element mineralogy, aqueous solution chemistry and toxicity for lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, selenium, and tellurium. This paper reviews the deportment of these elements during gold ore cyanidation (including carbon adsorption and elution) and tailings disposal. It also captures related information from the treatment of industrial wastes and wastewaters, including fixation and encapsulation processes that may be applicable to tailings generated from gold ore processing. The main findings were that only lead, cadmium and mercury form cyano complexes ranging from very weak (Pb) through moderate (Cd) to the strong mercuro complexes. The neutral cyano-complexes of cadmium and mercury strongly adsorb onto activated carbon and thus potentially deport to the gold recovery circuit and carbon regeneration kiln. The strong mercury cyano complexes will persist in tailings storage environments. Arsenic, antimony and bismuth do not form cyanide complexes. The less metallic of these (As and Sb) may form oxyanions and/or thioanions that consume oxygen and retard or prevent gold dissolution. They can be present in solution, including tailings solutions, at relatively high concentrations. Bismuth, being more metallic, remains in the solid phase as a sulfide or oxide during cyanidation. Depending on the redox potential in solution, selenium and tellurium form the oxyanions selenite and tellurite or selenate and tellurate in cyanide solutions. Selenium may form selenocyanate (SeCN-) in cyanide solutions, which is thermodynamically more stable than the oxyanions selenite and selenate. Tellurocyanate is unstable and does not form. The potential for adsorption of selenium or tellurium onto activated carbon is unknown, as is their persistence in tailings storage facilities. Lead, cadmium and mercury are best removed from wastewaters by precipitation as sulfides or adsorption onto activated carbon or iron or aluminium oxides. Arsenic and antimony in acidic tailings and mine drainage waters are also attenuated by precipitation onto iron oxides, or by precipitation as scorodite (FeAsO 4. 2 H 2 O) or <b>senarmontite</b> (Sb 2 O 3). Selenite in wastewater efficiently adsorbs on to both iron and manganese oxides but selenate does not.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis is to close some gaps in our {{understanding}} of the factors that govern the rates of mobilization of antimony from its natural sources, viz. from its most abundant minerals, namely stibnite, the most abundant antimony mineral, and its principal weathering products in the supergene zone, namely <b>senarmontite,</b> valentinite and stibiconite. Antimony may also become enriched in soils and sediments, as a result of anthropogenic or natural contamination, and be mobilized thence; therefore, the specific mobilization of antimony in the form of Sb(V) from sediment was also considered. The first (introductory) Chapter is meant to give a comprehensive summary of the known geochemistry of antimony along with an outline of the theoretical basis of most of the material presented in the main chapters. In the second Chapter, we study the rate of oxidative dissolution of stibnite in acidic solution and derive a rate law in terms of hydrogen ion concentration and dissolved oxygen, and the activation energy of the process is measured. The effect of Fe 3 + and other trivalent cations on the rate, and the formation of elemental sulfur at the dissolving mineral surface are also examined. In Chapter III, essentially the same study is repeated in basic solution and the observed dissolution rate in a natural system, specifically, the antimony mineralization near Goesdorf (L), is explained on the basis of our findings. Activation energies indicate that the dissolution processes are diffusion controlled in acidic, and surface controlled in basic solution. Another important (new) finding is the promotive effect exerted by metal cations, both in acidic and in basic solution. These are, to our knowledge, the first reported instances of metal-promoted dissolution {{in the case of a}} sulfide mineral. In Chapter IV, we investigate and rationalize the effects of organic ligands which commonly occur in the soil solution on the rate of dissolution of stibnite. Both the type of ligand and the contact time of the solution with the mineral determine whether an enhancement of the Sb mobilization is to be expected. In Chapter V, we turn to the oxide minerals of antimony; we derive rate laws for their proton-promoted dissolution over the environmentally relevant pH range (2 to 11) and measure the activation energies of these processes. These energies are in the range of surface controlled mechanisms, except for valentinite in basic solution, which appears to be transport-controlled, and stibiconite, which dissolves with a negative activation energy in acidic solution. Negative activation energies for mineral dissolution are exceedingly rare though their existence was predicted on theoretical grounds. Stibiconite represents the first reported oxide mineral with a negative dissolution activation energy. The results from this Chapter permit to derive the following sequence of dissolution rates, valid over most of the pH range 2 - 11 : valentinite>senarmontite>stibiconite>stibnite. Geochemical implications of this order of reactivities are discussed. In Chapter VI, the mobilizing effect of common inorganic anionic aquatic species on antimony bearing sediment, and on pure phases representative of those present in sediments, is examined. The main objective consists in verifying whether carbonate and phosphate, known to mobilize As from sediments and soils, mobilize Sb as well. Phosphate at environmental concentrations has little impact, while that of carbonate, at environmentally relevant concentrations, is very slight, although significant. The Appendices contain, among others, detailed experimental results that are merely mentioned in the main text, or that are only presented there in graphical form, as well as the development of a UV-photometric method for the determination of elemental sulfur on mineral surfaces. The method is applied to weathered stibnite in Chapters II and III; it is more sensitive, more economic, more environmentally friendly, and easier to carry out than the literature method...|$|E
