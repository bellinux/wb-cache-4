50|$|Research {{aircraft}} of the 1950s and '60s {{found it}} difficult to break the sound barrier, or even reach Mach 0.9, with conventional airfoils. Supersonic airflow over the upper surface of the traditional airfoil induced excessive wave drag and a form of <b>stability</b> <b>loss</b> called Mach tuck. Due to the airfoil shape used, supercritical wings experience these problems less severely and at much higher speeds, thus allowing the wing to maintain high performance at speeds closer to Mach 1. Techniques learned from studies of the original supercritical airfoil sections are used in designing airfoils for high-speed subsonic and transonic aircraft from the Airbus A300 and Boeing 777 to the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II.|$|E

After reviewing a single delay model, we proceed to two models with two delays. When the two delays are used to form an expected price or feedback for price adjustment, we have a winding stability switching curve and in consequence obtain repetition of <b>stability</b> <b>losses</b> and gains via Hopf bifurcation. When the two delays are involved in two interrelated markets, we find that the stability switching occurs on straight lines and complicated dynamics can arise in unstable markets...|$|R

40|$|Highly stable {{structures}} that are destined for space use {{are vulnerable to}} dimen-sional <b>stability</b> <b>loss</b> due to random vibration loads experienced during launch and ground testing. Small movements at structural interfaces and non-recoverable strains induced in me-tering elements can have negative implications for optical performance on-orbit. Often the dimensional stability aspects of optical bench structures are verified by environ-mental tests on Engineering or Protoflight Model instruments. It is proposed that {{a better understanding of}} vibration-induced structural dimensional <b>stability</b> <b>loss</b> could enable the as-sessment of <b>stability</b> <b>loss</b> through analysis at an early stage. To this end, several tests have been developed at RAL to assess dimensional <b>stability</b> <b>loss</b> in materials and joints in a controlled manner under random vibration. One test has been used to assess Al alloy and CFRP material samples in a 4 -point bending configuration, and anoth-er has been used to assess micron-level slipping at a bolted interface. The aim of these tests was to provide useful material data, and also to assess the feasibility of predicting <b>stability</b> <b>loss</b> caused by random vibration events. It was found that the classical frequency domain random vibration Finite Element Analysis commonly performed to assess safety margins against structural failure on space structures is probably insufficient to predict instability. This is because the results are highly dependent on non-symmetry in the stress response (ie, due to gravity, pre-stress, or non-linear response). However a good correlation with test results was achieved with a time domain FEA model which incorporates nonlinear kinematic hardening rules in the materials...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} and breakup of liquid bridges with a free contact line on surfaces with contact-angle hysteresis (CAH) under zero-gravity conditions. Non-ideal surfaces exhibit CAH because of surface imperfections, by which the constraints on three-phase contact lines are influenced. Given that interfacial instabilities are constraint-sensitive, understanding how CAH affects {{the stability and}} breakup of liquid bridges is crucial for predicting the drop size in contact-drop dispensing. Unlike ideal surfaces on which contact lines are always free irrespective of surface wettability, contact lines may undergo transitions from pinned to free and vice versa during drop deposition on non-ideal surfaces. Here, we experimentally and theoretically examine how stability and breakup are affected by CAH, highlighting cases where stability is lost during a transition from a pinned–pinned (more constrained) to pinned-free (less constrained) interface—rather than a critical state. This provides a practical means of expediting or delaying <b>stability</b> <b>loss.</b> We also demonstrate how the dynamic contact angle can control the contact-line radius following <b>stability</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|E
