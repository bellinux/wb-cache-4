5|$|As {{a teacher}} he urged his {{students}} to read extensively and be original in their work. The <b>students</b> <b>did</b> {{not have access to}} the newspapers he had read as a student, so Achebe made his own available in the classroom. He taught in Oba for four months, but when an opportunity arose in 1954 to work for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS), he left the school and moved to Lagos.|$|E
5|$|Sources differ {{about the}} cities hosting {{some of the}} early IMOs. This may be partly because leaders are {{generally}} housed well away from the students, and partly because after the competition the <b>students</b> <b>did</b> not always stay based in one city {{for the rest of the}} IMO. The exact dates cited may also differ, because of leaders arriving before the students, and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Abbe {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom. He went at {{the invitation}} of the London Judo Society (LJS), and was the first master to teach aikido in the UK. That year, he demonstrated aikido at the LJS and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Abbe came to experience two problems at the LJS: first, he felt that the students there were more concerned with competition than his theories, and second, he felt that the <b>students</b> <b>did</b> not treat him with the appropriate respect for someone of his rank and experience in the martial arts. According to the International Budo Council (IBC), he founded the IBC in 1955.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century the colony's ethnic Chinese {{population}} was severely undereducated, unable to enter schools for either Europeans or natives. Aged ten, Lie {{was enrolled in a}} Calvinist missionary school run by Christiaan Albers. This school had roughly 60male students, mostly Chinese. Under Albers, a fluent speaker of Sundanese, he received his formal education in a curriculum which included the sciences, language, and Christianity– the schools were meant to promote Christianity in the Dutch East Indies, and students were required to pray before class. Lie, as with most <b>students,</b> <b>did</b> not convert, although biographer Tio Ie Soei writes that an understanding of Christianity likely affected his world view.|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant <b>students</b> <b>did</b> spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of printing, written legal texts became more available, reducing the need for students to attend readings and lectures. However, {{this meant that the}} students denied themselves the opportunity to query what they had learnt or discuss it in greater detail. Eventually, students now had a way to learn without attending lectures, they began to excuse themselves from lectures, meetings and moots altogether; in the early 17th century they developed a way of deputising other students to do their moots for them. The Benchers and Readers did little to arrest the decline of the practice of lecturers and readings, first because many probably believed (as the <b>students</b> <b>did)</b> that books were an adequate substitute, and secondly because many were keen to avoid the work of preparing a reading, which cut into their time as practising barristers. These problems were endemic to all the Inns, not just Gray's Inn.|$|E
50|$|Current {{practice}} is {{to notify the}} student's parent if the <b>student</b> <b>does</b> {{not participate in the}} practice of religion. Reports can be made, for example, a one-time enrollment at school or in each case. After notification, the school must ensure that the <b>student</b> <b>does</b> not participate in these events. The school is responsible for student safety, even when the <b>student</b> <b>does</b> not participate in the school to organize a religious ceremony. The school organizes the student the opportunity for a period of other activities. In high school, notification is made by the student himself.|$|R

25|$|To {{become a}} practitioner, {{there was no}} one fixed method or path of training. There was even no formal {{specialization}} in the different branches of medicine, as might be expected.

25|$|Santa Barbara, California – Numerous businesses, {{particularly}} in heavily Latino areas, {{closed for the}} day.

25|$|The <b>students</b> <b>did</b> chores for {{two hours}} each day: the boys worked on the farm, in the garden or chopped firewood, while the girls did {{household}} duties, assisted with sewing, cooking and washing, {{and took care of}} the dining room. The students were provided with three meals a day, and were given plenty of time to sleep and play. Religious study was regularly kept up, and included church on Sunday and praying each morning and evening every day of the week. Every night at dinner, along with singing and praying, every student had to recite a verse, or part of a verse, of Scripture from the Bible.|$|E
25|$|At {{three o'clock}} Father William Corby, the University president, {{met with his}} wisest assistants and they {{determined}} that nothing could be done but close the college for the year. An hour after he communicated the decision to the students assembled in the church. <b>Students</b> <b>did</b> not want to leave, but Fr. Corby {{made it clear that}} the University could not provide any accommodations. Hence, the students were sent home for the semester. The loss was estimated at $200,000 and only $45,000 was recovered from the insurance. It was a terrible blow, for in three hours was wiped out the result of thirty-five years of hard, grueling sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} sole purpose of Jamaica College from 1903 onwards was to train {{potential}} university students in the days when the University of the West Indies did not exist, in practice most <b>students</b> <b>did</b> not go further than fourth or fifth forms. That was considered sufficient education for just about any managerial or clerical job in Jamaica. It was also considered uneconomical to run a school of less than eighty boys, and therefore a deliberate attempt to expand the school to include those of parents who were able to afford the fees was embarked upon. By the 1930s, the student population rose to over one hundred and fifty.|$|E

25|$|In 1769, {{the first}} year of operation, the Schools {{enrolled}} 77 students. By 1830 over 1,500 students had enrolled in the Schools, giving an average intake of 25 students each year. They included men such as John Flaxman, J. M. W. Turner, John Soane, Thomas Rowlandson, William Blake, Thomas Lawrence, John Constable, George Hayter, David Wilkie, William Etty and Edwin Landseer. The term of studentship was at first six years. This was increased to seven years in 1792 and to ten in 1800; it remained at ten till 1853. These figures must be regarded, however, only as years of eligibility. Likely many of the <b>students</b> <b>did</b> not complete their full term, but there are no records of attendance and termination of studentships from the early years.|$|E
25|$|North Dakota was {{far away}} from the centers of the hippie {{movement}} on the coasts of the United States, but this did not mean that the local <b>students</b> <b>did</b> not {{know what was going on}} with their peers at schools such as UC-Berkeley. The combination of tension between the students and the established powers, and the local and state governments' lack of experience in dealing with large gatherings of angry and drunk protesters led to the riot that would put Zap, North Dakota across the headlines of the U.S. newspapers and make it the lead story on the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. What started out as a lark turned into a riot that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage.|$|E
25|$|Private tuition is {{a lucrative}} {{industry}} in Singapore, since many parents {{send their children}} for private tuition after school. A straw poll by The Straits Times newspaper in 2008 found that out of 100 students interviewed, only 3 <b>students</b> <b>did</b> not have any form of tuition. In 2010, the Shin Min Daily News estimated that there were around 540 tuition centres offering private tuition in Singapore. Due to their high demand, tuition centres are able to charge high fees for their services; they have an annual turnover of SGD$110.6 million in 2005. However, this industry is largely unregulated, though tuition centres are required to be registered with the Ministry of Education. There is no such requirement for individual private tutors.|$|E
