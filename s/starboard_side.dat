5|$|All battleships are top {{heavy and}} tend to settle upside down when they sink. Arkansas settled upside down, but a 1989 diver's sketch of the wreck shows hardly any of the <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of the hull, making it look like the ship is lying on her side. Most of the <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> is present, but {{severely}} compacted.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's <b>starboard</b> <b>side.</b> The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales fired unopposed {{until she}} began a port turn at 05:57, when Prinz Eugen took her under fire. After Hood {{exploded}} at 06:01, the Germans opened intense and accurate fire on Prince of Wales, with 15-inch, 8-inch and 5.9-inch guns. A heavy hit was sustained below the waterline as Prince of Wales manoeuvred through {{the wreckage of}} Hood. At 06:02, a 15-inch shell struck the <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of the compass platform and killed {{the majority of the}} personnel there. The navigating officer was wounded, but Captain Leach was unhurt. Casualties were caused by the fragments from the shell's ballistic cap and the material it dislodged in its diagonal path through the compass platform. A 15-inch diving shell penetrated the ship's side below the armour belt amidships, failed to explode and came to rest in the wing compartments on the <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of the after boiler rooms. The shell was discovered and defused when the ship was docked at Rosyth.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: USS Tantalus (ARL-27) {{looking forward}} while {{underway}} {{en route to}} Guam with barges secured to both port and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides,</b> date unknown.|$|R
6000|$|... "Me? Why? There's a whole {{switchboard}} full o' nickel-plated muckin's which I haven't {{begun to}} play with yet. The <b>starboard</b> <b>side's</b> crawlin' with 'em." ...|$|R
50|$|Goldfish: the Goldfish has a main gun on its prow, and two {{secondary}} guns on {{the port}} and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides.</b> It relies on its moderate speed and high maneuverability.|$|R
5|$|She {{was given}} a more {{extensive}} refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted AA guns on her flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, {{and gave her a}} small island on the <b>starboard</b> <b>side.</b> Furious resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} armament for Montana and {{her sisters}} was to be 20 /54 cal guns housed in 10 turrets along the island of the battleship; five on the <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> and five on the port. These guns, designed specifically for the Montanas, were to be the replacement for the /38 cal secondary gun batteries then in widespread use with the US Navy.|$|E
5|$|At about 02:30, crewmen aboard Tubantia {{spotted a}} stream of bubbles rapidly {{approaching}} the ship's <b>starboard</b> <b>side,</b> followed by an explosion. The ship quickly began sinking. Distress calls sent out by Tubantia were answered by three ships, Breda, Krakstau, and La Campine, which between them rescued all 80 passengers and all 294 members of the crew. The ship and her cargo were a total loss. Tubantia was the largest neutral vessel sunk during the entire war.|$|E
50|$|Behind the torpedo tubes on the aft deck, in {{the port}} and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides,</b> are each one Abrollgestell depth charge {{launcher}}. Twelve depth charges, six for each launcher can be carried.|$|R
2500|$|PT PAL {{confirmed}} that the SSVs will be designed to support one [...] gun on the foredeck as the main armament. Two stern-facing [...] guns will also be fitted, one each on the port and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{ship had}} hydrographic booms and winches on her bridge deck on both her port and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides.</b> The booms had {{mechanical}} travelers to which lowering blocks were attached which regulated {{the distance of}} the lowering wire from the rail.|$|R
5|$|Edward Fletcher as Sixth Officer James Moody: The ship's only junior {{officer to}} {{have died in the}} sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown {{following}} Mr. Murdoch's orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs First Officer Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.|$|E
5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} {{wreckage}} from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the original wreckage had been found. This wreckage was from the <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of the cabin just above the three front windows. Subsequent examination at Farnborough suggested that the primary failure was probably near to this area {{rather than at the}} rear automatic direction finding window {{on the roof of the}} cabin as had been previously thought. These findings were kept secret until the details were published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In the event, Titanics heading changed {{just in time}} {{to avoid}} a head-on collision, but the change in {{direction}} caused the ship to strike the iceberg with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along the <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of the ship for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from upper parts of the berg fell onto her forward decks. A few minutes later, all of Titanics engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and drifting in the Labrador Current.|$|E
50|$|The table planks consist {{entirely of}} {{parallel}} ribs that {{begin and end}} at the rail. The bottom (longest) plank runs from stem to stern and the top two (shortest) are located amidships at the railing on the port and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides</b> of the boat.|$|R
50|$|These second {{generation}} chain steamers were equipped {{with two of}} these water turbines, which {{were found on the}} port and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides.</b> During a turning manoeuvre the water flowed forwards on one side and backwards on the other in order to rotate the boat.|$|R
50|$|The Landing Bay is a deck {{incorporating}} landing, hangar, {{repair and}} launching facilities for Vipers and shuttles. There {{are two of}} these, located amidships on both the port and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides</b> of Galactica. One {{is known as the}} Alpha Landing Bay (the other presumably would be the Beta Landing Bay).|$|R
5|$|Melbournes {{service is}} commemorated with a stained-glass {{window at the}} Garden Island Naval Chapel. One of the ship's anchors is {{incorporated}} into a memorial to naval aviation at Nowra, New South Wales. Another anchor and the <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> ship's bell are {{on display at the}} RAN Heritage Centre at Garden Island. Memorabilia from Melbournes voyages with the Fleet Air Arm embarked, and examples of all the types of aircraft deployed on Melbourne, are on permanent static display in the Fleet Air Arm Museum at HMAS Albatross.|$|E
5|$|One {{beneficial}} effect of Hurricane Dennis was the rolling {{of the former}} USS Spiegel Grove. Spiegel Grove was sunk in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary {{in an attempt to}} create an artificial reef. However, the ship turned over and landed on the bottom upside down. Efforts to roll the ship were partially successful, bringing it onto its <b>starboard</b> <b>side,</b> but Hurricane Dennis completed the roll, bringing Spiegel Grove into its intended upright position.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} of {{the aircraft}} is built around the cannon. The GAU-8/A is mounted slightly to the port side; the barrel in the firing location is on the <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> at the 9 o'clock position so it is aligned with the aircraft's centerline. The gun's 5-foot, 11.5-inch (1.816 m) ammunition drum can hold up to 1,350 rounds of 30mm ammunition, but generally holds 1,174 rounds. To protect the GAU-8/A rounds from enemy fire, armor plates of differing thicknesses between the aircraft skin and the drum are designed to detonate incoming shells.|$|E
50|$|The draft {{survey is}} {{performed}} {{by reading the}} ship's draft on the draft markings at six standard points on the hull: forward, midships and aft on both port and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides.</b> Corrections for factors such as trim, water density and non-cargo weight changes are made before calculating the cargo weight change.|$|R
5000|$|The steamer's {{propulsion}} system consisted of four Scotch marine boilers delivering steam to an inclined triple expansion engine that turned a crankshaft attached to feathering paddle-wheels {{on the port}} and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides.</b> She {{was the last of}} the great Day Line [...] "side-wheelers", and the last of her kind to ply the Hudson River.|$|R
25|$|One level {{down was}} Pont Promenade, the main Tourist Class deck. The main lounges and rooms here were the , , , and {{orchestra}} {{level of the}} theatre. Like the Pont Veranda, Pont Promenade also had a glass-enclosed promenade along the port and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides</b> of the ship, though the windows did not run full height, nor were the spaces as long.|$|R
5|$|The torpedo {{struck the}} after {{portion of the}} <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of the Houston, blowing 20 men {{overboard}} and spreading gasoline fires in the waters around the cruiser. Initially unsure whether the ship would hold together, the captain ordered the evacuation of 300 crew members while the ship's condition was ascertained. In {{the end it was}} determined she would stay afloat. Towing continued as before, slowly moving the task group towards the Navy base at Ulithi.|$|E
5|$|Constellation sailed {{ahead of}} L'Insurgente and crossed her bow, raking {{her with a}} {{broadside}} as she moved past. Constellation sailed over to gain L'Insurgentes <b>starboard</b> <b>side,</b> and the two ships settled into exchanging broadsides. The French frigate was hulled multiple times, disabling the French vessel's 18-pounder guns while Constellation suffered damage to her rigging. Constellation again sailed ahead of L'Insurgente, reversing course to cross her bow and rake her a second time. Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair L'Insurgentes rigging were fruitless. Once more Constellation maneuvered to reach L'Insurgentes leeward side. As Constellation crossed the frigate's bow again to rake her a third time, the French ship struck, having sustained too much damage. The engagement had lasted 74 minutes.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, John Ingle, {{the former}} captain of Pegasus, was tasked with {{clearing}} wrecks from the harbor in Dar es Salaam. At that time, {{he bought the}} salvage rights to Königsberg {{for the price of}} £200; he sent divers to extract non-ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights. Salvage work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her <b>starboard</b> <b>side.</b> As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into the riverbed. Three of the ship's 10.5cm guns are preserved, one in Pretoria, South Africa, one in Jinja, Uganda, and one in Mombasa, along with a gun from Pegasus.|$|E
50|$|The USS Hanson was in {{commission}} {{for more than}} 27 years. In 1972, Hanson displayed two plexiglas (about 2'x 5') placards from the bridge wings, forward, on port and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides</b> showing at least 12 awards. At various times in her career, Hanson also displayed Battle Effectiveness Award insignia for Antisubmarine warfare excellence, Operational excellence and Gunnery excellence.|$|R
2500|$|The {{process of}} {{determining}} a vessel's displacement begins with measuring its draft This {{is accomplished by}} means of its [...] "draft marks" [...] (or [...] "load lines"). [...] A merchant vessel has three matching sets: [...] one mark each on the port and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides</b> forward, midships, and astern. These marks allow a ship's displacement to be determined to an accuracy of 0.5%.|$|R
40|$|During {{refurbishing}} of a {{pilotless target aircraft}} after a sortie, {{the hinge}} pins which connect the elevator to a connecting flange was found broken on both port and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides.</b> These pins had been cadmium plated. Electron fractography indicated that {{the failure of the}} pins was due to hydrogen embrittlement. Also the hinge pins did not conform to material specifications...|$|R
5|$|In 1977, British Airways and Singapore Airlines {{shared a}} Concorde for flights between London and Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar via Bahrain. The aircraft, BA's Concorde G-BOAD, was painted in Singapore Airlines livery {{on the port}} side and British Airways livery on the <b>starboard</b> <b>side.</b> The service was {{discontinued}} after three return flights because of noise complaints from the Malaysian government; it could only be reinstated on a new route bypassing Malaysian airspace in 1979. A dispute with India prevented Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian airspace, so the route was eventually declared not viable and discontinued in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Losing {{power and}} speed, Roma {{began to fall}} out of the battle group. Around 16:02, another Fritz X slammed into the <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of Romas deck, between frames 123 and 136. It most likely detonated in the forward engine room, {{sparking}} flames, and causing heavy flooding in the magazines of main battery turret number two and the fore port side secondary battery turret, and putting even more pressure upon the previously stressed hull girder. Seconds after the initial blast, the number two 15-inch turret was blown over the side by a massive explosion, this time from the detonation of that turret's magazines.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} given a more {{extensive}} refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted anti-aircraft guns on her lower flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, {{and gave her a}} small island on the <b>starboard</b> <b>side.</b> Furious resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939. As a deck-landing training carrier in 1939 Furious embarked 767 Squadron, flying Shark, Swordfish and Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft, and 769 Squadron, flying Blackburn Skua, Blackburn Roc, and Gloster Sea Gladiator fighters.|$|E
50|$|The {{asymmetric}} flow {{around a}} ship {{induced by the}} vicinity of banks causes pressure differences (Bernoulli's principle) between port and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides.</b> As a result, a lateral force will act on the ship, mostly directed towards the closest bank, {{as well as a}} yawing moment pushing her bow towards the centre of the waterway. The squat effect increases due to the decreased blockage.|$|R
50|$|The hull {{is divided}} into the main hull with the bridge and {{propulsion}} systems, and winged hangar bays on the port and <b>starboard</b> <b>sides.</b> Each hangar bay typically carries many Viper Starfighters and several shuttles. Given the large dimensions of the ship design there is an internal rail car system to transport personnel, especially {{in the event of}} a battle alert.|$|R
