40|$|Abstract—As for {{standard}} {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) scanners, MR-compatible PET scanners will require <b>gamma</b> <b>shielding</b> to suppress the influence of activity outside the PET field of view (FOV). Suitable materials must have very specific properties, including magnetic properties close to those of water, high density, high atomic number, and ideally a low conductivity. In order to identify potential suitable materials, we have selected several heavy-metal-based candidates based on the available data for magnetic and shielding properties. These materials include several nonferromagnetic metals and metal oxides, two scintillating crystals (bismuth germanate and lead tungstate) and two metal/epoxy compounds. The magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) compatibility of these materials was assessed under various conditions, both on a human and a small-animal MRI scanner. In parallel, we assessed the shielding efficiency at 661 keV {{of the most promising}} candidates. These experiments showed that there is a range of possibilities for the design of MR-compatible <b>gamma</b> <b>shields.</b> Lead has acceptable magnetic compatibility but can induce significant conductivity-related artefacts. Heavy-metal-based minerals are fully insulating and hot-pressed lead monoxide showed good MR compatibility com-bined with good shielding properties. Other possibilities include the use of lead based powders and heavy-metal oxide composites. Index Terms—Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), shielding. I...|$|R

To achieve this goal, 2 DVD measurements and <b>simulated</b> <b>gamma</b> size distributions were considered. The analysis of <b>simulated</b> <b>gamma</b> DSD binned according each instrument was performed to understand the role of discretisation and truncation effects together on the integral rainfall parameters and estimators of the DSD parameters. In addition, the drop-by-drop output of the 2 DVD is binned to simulate the raw output of the other disdrometers which allowed us estimate sampling and binning effects on selected events from available dataset. From simulated DSD it has been found that binning effects exist in integral rainfall parameters and in the evaluation of DSD parameters of a gamma distribution. This study indicates that POSS and JWD exhibit underestimation of concentration and mean diameter due to binning. Thies and Parsivel report a positive bias for rainfall and reflectivity (reaching 5 % for heavy rainfall intensity events). Regarding to DSD parameters, distributions of estimators for the shape and scale parameters were analyzed by moment, truncated moment and maximum likelihood methods. They reported noticeable differences between instruments for all methodologies of estimation applied. The measurements of 2 DVD allow sampling error estimation of instruments with smaller capture areas than 2 DVD. The results show that the instrument differences due to sampling were a~relevant uncertainty but that concentration, reflectivity and mass-weighted diameter were sensitive to binning...|$|R
