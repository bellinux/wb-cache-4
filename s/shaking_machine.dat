A number of olive mills, representative both for quality and for quantity of the production, have been taken into account. Different noise levels have been detected during the open field tests caried out with the self-moved <b>shaking</b> <b>machine</b> (LEP,d = 77, 2 dB(A)) and the hand-held <b>shaking</b> <b>machine</b> (LEP,d = 91, 7 dB(A)). Also for the tests carried out within the olive mills during the olive extraction phase different noise levels have been obtained; in this case, higher noise levels have been detected in continuous olive mills (LEP,d = 86, 2 dB(A)) rather than in traditional ones (LEP,d = 79, 0 dB(A)). A wider experimentation on the noise levels and on the microclimate in the olive mills would be hoped for, so as to put identify designs guide lines for the structures and the for the production machinery layout in order to realize more comfortable working conditions for the operators...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{vibration}} measurement has assumed increasing importance {{in recent years}} for different aspects. In {{the first phase of}} this study an analysis of vibrations by means of contact accelerometers was carried out to study a tree <b>shaking</b> <b>machine</b> used in the mechanical harvesting of olives. Then a kinematic analysis of motion with a contactless method was carried out on a belt transmission system equipped with three pulleys: a high speed camera was used, able to capture up to 500 frames per second thus to follow the position of any moving point of the mechanical system under investigation. Vibrations were acquired detecting the positions during time of a marker fixed on the belt. The proposed method made it possible to analyse the mechanism and verify both known behaviours and neglected aspects in the usual kinematic analysis carried out using acceleration measurements. © (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|Although {{adenovirus}} {{infection of}} HeLa cells {{is characterized by}} slow adsorption of virus (1, 2) and a latent period of 14 to 21 hours (2 - 4), the effects of low dilutions of infectious tissue culture material can be detected {{within a few hours}} after inoculation.

Also, Levy et a/. (6) reported stimulation of radioisotope uptake by adenovirus infected HeLa cells beginning within 2 to 4 hours after inoculation. During the course of the latter study, another early alteration was observed, namely, that the infected cultures tended to detach from the glass wall of the culture vessel when rinsed within several hours after inoculation; the same observation has been noted by Ginsberg (2).

40|$|Determination of {{carbohydrates}} in soil requires prior extraction and numerous extraction methods were suggested for this purpose. Three methods and five extractants were applied {{in order to}} extract carbohydrate fraction in three soil types; forest, clayey and saline soils. The extraction methods were: 1) shaken in a plane rotary <b>shaking</b> <b>machine</b> for 16 h 2) heated in steam-bath for 2. 5 h and 3) heated in oven for 24 h and extractants included 1) 0. 5 M HCL, (2) 0. 25 M H 2 SO 4, 3) 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4, 4) 0. 5 M K 2 SO 4 and 5) distilled water. Carbohydrate content in soil was measured by phenol-sulphuric acid method. The addition of phenol to the extracted solution of HCl caused to milky precipitation. Therefore, this extractant {{can not be used}} for carbohydrate extraction in the phenol-sulphuric acid spectroscopic method. The results showed that in all soils and in the shaker extraction method, carbohydrate content was lower than in the oven and steam-bath extraction methods.

For the clayey soil, the carbohydrate content was higher in the oven method than that of the steam-bath method. In all soils, the extracted carbohydrate by 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 extractant was greater than those of other extractants.

40|$|The current {{philosophy}} of earthquake resistant design {{is that a}} structure {{should be able to}} withstand an extremely strong motion earthquake without collapsing, even though a certain amount of damage is incurred. To make such a design requires a knowledge of the dynamic behavior of structures under large amplitude vibrations. The objective of the work reported here was to investigate the dynamic frequency response characteristics of a mild steel structure vibrating in the plastic range. Comparisons were made of the static, the dynamic, and the theoretical responses of the yielding structure. The behavior of single-story structures having structural steel columns was investigated experimentally by means of horizontally applied forces generated by a <b>shaking</b> <b>machine.</b> The experimentally determined dynamic response showed the decrease in resonant frequency for increases in deflection amplitude which is characteristic of a "softening spring" type of nonlinearity. Ultraharmonic response was also observed. Under steady-state oscillations the fraction of equivalent viscous damping varied from 0. 0016 at small, elastic deflections to 0. 089 at large, plastic deflections. Structural deterioration was observed in both the static and dynamic experiments with a recovery of strength occurring between tests. A completely stable hysteretic loop was not attained at large deflection amplitudes, and the hysteresis loop did not become completely stable until the deflection amplitude was reduced to almost the initial yield value. However, the change in the hysteretic loop per cycle for the large deflections was small enough to permit assuming that a steady-state dynamic condition existed over a limited number of cycles. Discrepancies between the theoretical and the experimental virgin force-deflection curves were found and these are shown {{to be the result of}} simplifying approximations introduced in the structural analysis. It was found that the resonant vibrational amplitude of the structure can be predicted within 20 %, and the resonant natural frequency within 2 1 / 2 %, on the basis of the static virgin force-deflection curve. For large, plastic deflections at an excitation frequency of 3 cps, it was found that the differences between the dynamic and the static hysteresis loops were less than the changes in the static loops resulting from the deterioration caused by repeated cycles of loading...|$|E
