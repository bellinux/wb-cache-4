5000|$|The Cabin Collective is an Irish country-rock band {{formed in}} Tuam, Galway in 2013. The band, which takes {{its name from}} the Scandinavian-style log cabin where they rehearse, was formed {{as a result of a}} fellow Tuam band, The <b>Saw</b> <b>Doctors,</b> taking a {{temporary}} break. During that break, three members of the <b>Saw</b> <b>Doctors</b> - Moran, O'Neill, and Thistlethwaite - joined with fellow Galway musicians (including Keith Mullins, a regular support act of the <b>Saw</b> <b>Doctors,</b> and former <b>Saw</b> <b>Doctors</b> drummer Eímhín Cradock).|$|R

5000|$|In 1994 {{the single}} [...] "Spanish Lady" [...] was {{released}} by Dustin the Turkey and went to No.1 in the Irish Singles Chart on 18 November and stayed there for 4 weeks. Proceeds of the single’s sale were in aid of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland. It featured Ronnie Drew and The <b>Saw</b> <b>Doctors.</b> Although not mentioned on the cover sleeve The <b>Saw</b> <b>Doctors</b> are clearly identified during the comic number when Dustin sings [...] "Hey Ronnie is that the <b>Saw</b> <b>Doctors?</b> Is it?

6000|$|... "Now {{you shall}} hear. We knew a famous Italian chemist at Rome--such a nice old man! He {{and my father}} used to play piquet; and I looked at them, and tried to learn--and I was too stupid. But I had plenty of {{opportunities}} of noticing our old friend's hands. They were covered with stains; and he caught me looking at them. He was not in the least offended; he told me his experiments had spotted his skin in that way, and nothing would clean off the stains. I <b>saw</b> <b>Doctor</b> Benjulia's great big hands, while he was giving you the brandy--and I remembered afterwards that there were no stains on them. I seem to surprise you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, I guess I’ll stay,” {{said the}} young man as his companions merged {{themselves}} in the crowd that now was tending toward the gates. He went and stood by the barrier and <b>saw</b> <b>Doctor</b> Lemon and his friends pull up {{at the entrance to}} the Row, where they apparently prepared to separate. The separation took some time and Jackson’s colleague became interested. Lord Canterville and his younger daughter lingered to talk with two gentlemen, also mounted, who looked a good deal at the legs of Lady Agatha’s horse. Doctor Lemon and Lady Barb were face to face, very near each other, and she, leaning forward a little, stroked the overlapping neck of his glossy bay. At a distance he appeared to be talking and she to be listening without response. “Oh yes, he’s making love to her,” thought Sidney Feeder. Suddenly her father and sister turned away to leave the Park, and she joined them and disappeared while Jackson came up on the left again as for a final gallop. He hadn’t gone far before he perceived his comrade, who awaited him at the rail; and he repeated the gesture Lady Barb had described as a kiss of the hand, though it had not to his friend’s eyes that full grace. When he came within hail he pulled up.|$|E
60|$|All at {{once there}} was a sound like a tiny muffled {{explosion}} and the cover lifted right up on a level plane a few inches; there was no mistaking anything now, for the whole room was full of a blaze of light. Then the cover, staying fast at one side rose slowly up on the other, as though yielding to some pressure of balance. The coffer still continued to glow; from it began to steal a faint greenish smoke. I could not smell it fully on account of the respirator; but, even through that, I was conscious of a strange pungent odour. Then this smoke began to grow thicker, and to roll out in volumes of ever increasing density till the whole room began to get obscure. I had a terrible desire to rush over to Margaret, whom I saw through the smoke still standing erect behind the couch. Then, as I looked, I <b>saw</b> <b>Doctor</b> Winchester sink down. He was not unconscious; for he waved his hand back and forward, as though to forbid any one to come to him. At this time the figures of Mr. Trelawny and Mr. Corbeck were becoming indistinct in the smoke which rolled round them in thick billowy clouds. Finally I lost sight of them altogether. The coffer still continued to glow; but the lamps began to grow dim. At first I thought that their light was being overpowered by the thick black smoke; but presently I saw that they were, one by one, burning out. They must have burned quickly to produce such fierce and vivid flames.|$|E

6000|$|Just because I am an {{old woman}} {{outwardly}} it doesn't follow that I am one inwardly. Hearts don't grow old--or shouldn't. Mine hasn't, I am thankful to say. It bounded like a girl's with delight when I <b>saw</b> <b>Doctor</b> John and Marcella Barry drive past this afternoon. If the doctor had been my own son I couldn't have felt more real pleasure in his happiness. I'm only an old lady who can do little but sit by her window and knit, but eyes were made for seeing, and I use mine for that purpose. When I see the good and beautiful things--and a body need never look for the other kind, you know--the things God planned {{from the beginning and}} brought about in spite of the counter plans and schemes of men, I feel such a deep joy that I'm glad, even at seventy-five, to be alive in a world where such things come to pass. And if ever God meant and made two people for each other, those people were Doctor John and Marcella Barry; and that is what I always tell folk who come here commenting on the difference in their ages. [...] "Old enough to be her father," [...] sniffed Mrs. Riddell to me the other day. I didn't say anything to Mrs. Riddell. I just looked at her. I presume my face expressed what I felt pretty clearly. How any woman can live for sixty years in the world, as Mrs. Riddell has, a wife and mother at that, and not get some realization of the beauty and general satisfactoriness of a real and abiding love, is something I cannot understand and never shall be able to.|$|E

The highlights of the match were the encounters between Doctor X and Fabián el Gitano as the two continued their storyline, building to a future Lucha de Apuesta, mask vs. mask match between the two. Fabián's team won the first fall by pinfall and the second fall by disqualification when the referee <b>saw</b> <b>Doctor</b> X land a low blow on Fabián. The opening match saw the team of Disturbio and Camorra defeated Camaleón and Robin, the son of José Aarón Alvarado Nieves, who had wrestled as Robin Hood and Brazo Cibernético.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationships between self-reported degree of depression in alcoholic patients and the following variables: selected demographic variables of age, sex, race, marital status, and employment status; pattern of alcohol use; the developmental sequence of behaviors or symptoms/progression; and psychopathology as measured by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). The population in this study was comprised of 1539 patients ranging in age from 17 to 79. All patients had been admitted to an inpatient treatment program at a chemical dependency treatment center in the Midwest and had categorized their alcohol/substance abuse as using only or primarily alcohol. Each patient had completed a Patient Biographical Questionnaire and an MMPI five to seven days after admission. The responses were entered into the computer and added to the data bank. The patients chosen as subjects of the study were divided into (a) no depression, (b) felt depressed only, (c) felt depressed and <b>saw</b> <b>doctor,</b> (d) felt depressed, <b>saw</b> <b>doctor,</b> and was hospitalized. The four groups were then analyzed with reference to demographic variables, pattern of chemical use, developmental sequence or behavioral events or symptoms/progression, and psychopathology. Continuous data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation, and F test. Discrete data were analyzed using chi square. Self-reported degree of depression was significantly related to the demographics of age, sex, education, and employment status. The no depression group was older, had a lower percentage of females, had a slightly lower level of education, and a higher employment rate than the other three groups. Also, significantly related to degree of depression were pattern of alcohol use, progression of alcoholism, and the MMPI indices of psychopathology. The conclusions indicated that there is a significant difference in the above areas between alcoholics who self-report depression and those who don't, and that there is very little difference between alcoholics who self-report any level of depression...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} which children with {{acute otitis media}} {{are at risk of}} poor outcome and to assess benefit from antibiotics in these children. Design: Secondary analysis of randomised controlled trial cohort. Setting: Primary care. Participants: 315 children aged 6 months to 10 years. Intervention: Immediate or delayed (taken after 72 hours if necessary) antibiotics. Main outcome measure: Predictors of short term outcome: an episode of distress or night disturbance three days after child <b>saw</b> <b>doctor.</b> Results: Distress by day three was more likely in children with high temperature (adjusted odds ratio 4. 5, 95 % confidence interval 2. 3 to 9. 0), vomiting (2. 6, 1. 3 to 5. 0), and cough (2. 0, 1. 1 to 3. 8) on day one. Night disturbance by day three was more likely with high temperature 2. 4 (1. 2 to 4. 8), vomiting (2. 1, 1. 1 to 4. 0), cough (2. 3, 1. 3 to 4. 2), and ear discharge (2. 1, 1. 2 to 3. 9). Among the children with high temperature or vomiting, distress by day three was less likely with immediate antibiotics (32 % for immediate v 53 % for delayed, 2 = 4. 0; P= 0. 045, number needed to treat 5) as was night disturbance (26 % v 59 %, 2 = 9. 3; P= 0. 002; number needed to treat 3). In children without higher temperature or vomiting, immediate antibiotics made little difference to distress by day three (15 % v 19 %, 2 = 0. 74; P= 0. 39) or night disturbance (20 % v 27 %, 2 = 1. 6; P= 0. 20). Addition of cough did not significantly improve prediction of benefit. Conclusion: In children with otitis media but without fever and vomiting antibiotic treatment has little benefit and a poor outcome is unlikely...|$|E
