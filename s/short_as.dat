5|$|Abbas died {{in autumn}} 861, after another raid into Byzantine territory, and was buried at Caltagirone; the Byzantines later exhumed and burned his corpse. As his replacement, the Sicilian Muslims chose his uncle Ahmad ibn Ya'qub. His tenure was <b>short,</b> <b>as</b> in February 862 he was deposed {{in favour of}} Abdallah, son of Abbas. Abdallah's general Rabah was able to capture a few Byzantine fortresses, despite {{suffering}} a defeat in battle at first. Abdallah's elevation, however, was not acknowledged by the Aghlabids, and he was replaced, after only five months in office, by Khafaja ibn Sufyan.|$|E
50|$|During the club's {{first two}} years (2004-2005) they played in all white and all blue kits, with no clear {{distinction}} between which was considered its home kit. In 2006 the club adopted orange, dark blue and white as their primary colors. That year they wore dark blue with thick vertical orange stripes and dark blue <b>shorts</b> <b>as</b> their home kits and orange with white thick vertical stripes and orange <b>shorts</b> <b>as</b> their away kit.

5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally <b>short,</b> <b>as</b> a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
5|$|An unnamed {{precursor}} to Kenny {{first appeared in}} the first The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Frosty, created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the University of Colorado. The character was composed of construction paper cutouts and animated through the use of stop motion. When tasked three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another <b>short</b> <b>as</b> a video Christmas card that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Santa. In this short, Kenny is given his first name, and first appears as he does in the series.|$|E

However, headways have fallen short of the original plans. While trains do arrive every three minutes on the quadruple-interlined section between West Oakland and Daly City during weekday commute hours, each individual line operates at 15 minute intervals.|$|E

By the late 20th century however it became common for men to wear <b>shorts</b> <b>as</b> casual wear in summer.|$|R

The first champion Fuerza Guerrera is also {{the person who has}} held the title the shortest time, 22 days, except possibly for Mascara Magica, whose second reign was shorter; no specific date {{for the start of the}} reign has been confirmed, so his reign may have been as <b>short</b> <b>as</b> 6 days.|$|E

5|$|The Airborne Group {{had been}} experimenting with {{microwave}} systems as early as 1938 after discovering that a suitable arrangement of the acorn tubes could be operated at wavelengths as <b>short</b> <b>as</b> 30cm. However, these had very low output, and operated well within the region of reduced sensitivity on the receiver side, so detection ranges were very short. The group gave up on further development for the time being.|$|E

5|$|The PC and Macintosh {{versions}} of Star Wars: Dark Forces were well received, with the MS-DOS version holding an aggregate score on GameRankings of 77%. Publications compared Dark Forces to Doom, a significant video {{game in the}} first-person shooter genre at the time, but also indicated that Dark Forces improved upon Dooms features. Criticisms {{tended to focus on}} the game being too <b>short,</b> <b>as</b> well as lacking a multiplayer feature.|$|E
5|$|The {{dimensions}} of a Book of the Dead could vary widely; the longest is 40m long while some are as <b>short</b> <b>as</b> 1m. They {{are composed of}} sheets of papyrus joined together, the individual papyri varying in width from 15cm to 45cm. The scribes working on Book of the Dead papyri took more care over their work than those working on more mundane texts; care was taken to frame the text within margins, and to avoid writing on the joints between sheets. The words peret em heru, or 'coming forth by day' sometimes appear on the reverse of the outer margin, perhaps acting as a label.|$|E

The proposal did not manifest, largely due to Quwatli's relatively old age at the time. On 8 March 1963 a coalition of unionist officers consisting of Ba'athists, Nasserists and independent Arab nationalists overthrew the secessionist government of President Nazim al-Qudsi and Prime Minister Khalid al-Azm. Quwatli left Syria shortly after and moved to Beirut, Lebanon.|$|E
