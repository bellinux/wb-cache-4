5|$|In 1980, Akira Toriyama {{had created}} the popular manga Dr. Slump; within roughly six months, he wanted to end the series but his {{publisher}} Shueisha would only allow him to do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> agreed to start another serial for them shortly after. He worked with his editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, on several one-shots but none were successful. Torishima then suggested that as Toriyama enjoyed kung fu films, he should create a kung fu shōnen manga. This led to the two-part , published in the August and October 1983 issues of Fresh Jump. It follows a boy, adept at martial arts, who escorts a princess on a journey back to her home country. Dragon Boy was very well-received and evolved to become Dragon Ball.|$|E
25|$|Alsos Mission was an Allied effort {{commanded}} by the Russian-American Colonel Boris T. Pash. He reported directly to General Leslie Groves, {{commander of the}} Manhattan Engineer District, which was developing atomic weapons for the United States. The chief scientific advisor to Alsos Mission was the physicist Samuel Goudsmit. Goudsmit was selected for this task because he had physics knowledge, he spoke German, and he personally knew {{a number of the}} German scientists working on the German nuclear energy project. He also knew little of the Manhattan Project, <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were captured, he would have little intelligence value to the Germans.|$|E
25|$|The Communist radical {{of today}} will be the {{administrator}} of tomorrow, and the Communist Society will need the radical as badly as the capitalist society needs him now. It will then be {{the business of the}} radical, as it is now, not to take an appointment as justice of the Supreme Court, not to perform any particular function {{as a part of the}} established order, but to stand apart and speak his mind about the established order.... A radical who wishes to continue being a radical cannot do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is an essential part of the existing order, for then he owes a certain fealty to his position. I have seen Socialists elected to office; they become, not critical functionaries, but administrators, and one cannot be both at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Dahmer then brandished a {{knife and}} {{informed}} Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he {{would allow him to}} do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV; Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and chanting before turning his attention back to him: he placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his heartbeat and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart. In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and {{that he was not going}} to run away. (Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity.) When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning, to which Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again. When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.|$|E
500|$|Since the {{previous}} episode [...] "Occupation" [...] {{focused on the}} resistance, writer Ronald D. Moore wanted the second part {{to focus more on}} Jammer's role within the NCP, as he wanted to personalize somebody working for the police force. He also wanted to make Tigh know he's wrong with launching suicide bombers, but has to do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> believes doing so will defeat the Cylons. This is also Tigh's principal trait and role in the series. Moore stated [...] "why is Colonel Tigh on Galactica? Why does Adama keep him around? Because when the chips are down, and they are way down, baby, in this situation, when you are in a foxhole, who do you want next to you? You want Colonel Tigh 'cause he is gonna get your ass out of there." [...] The scene where Baltar speaks to an imprisoned Roslin about the suicide bombings was one of Moore's favourite scenes, as he wanted the audience to be unsure who to [...] "root for," [...] since Baltar is the biggest Cylon collaborator among the humans, but Roslin seemingly supports the bombings.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2010, Bain lodged an {{application}} for compensation for wrongful imprisonment. His case fell outside Cabinet rules on compensation, meaning the government was not obliged to pay him anything, but may do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was able to establish his innocence on [...] "the balance of probabilities" [...] and was also {{considered to be the}} [...] "victim of exceptional circumstances".|$|E

2500|$|Lester Patrick, {{managing}} the Spokane Canaries, {{thought he had}} an agreement to secure Johnson's playing rights for the 1916–17 season. Portland had come to verbal agreement with Patrick {{that they would do}} <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would relinquish claims on four players Portland sought to sign. When it was determined that some of those players would not report to Portland, the Rosebuds refused to relinquish Johnson, leading Patrick to claim he had been [...] "double crossed". [...] Remaining with the Rosebuds, Johnson posted a career high 21 points in 1916–17.|$|E
2500|$|After the Appeals court ruling, Dell'Utri {{expressed}} {{his admiration for}} the late Vittorio Mangano, a convicted Mafioso who up to his death in prison denied that any link existed between Cosa Nostra and Dell'Utri and Berlusconi. [...] "He was a sick inmate who was asked to testify against me and Berlusconi and always refused to do <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>he</b> had, anything {{he would have said}} would have been believed. But he preferred to stay in prison, and die there, rather than to make unjust accusations," [...] Dell'Utri said. [...] "He was my hero. I don't know if I could have resisted as much as he did." ...|$|E
2500|$|He had {{a lifelong}} love of {{literature}} and reading, and a passion for preserving African traditions of courtesy. He could be offended by discourteous behaviour and careless language, and insisted on punctuality among those in his employ. Gish described him as being both warm and exuberant, and outgoing and sensitive. Allen described him as a [...] "loving but strict father" [...] to his children. He was known to dislike gossip, discouraging it among his staff. He was offended by bad language and had a hatred of ethnic slurs. He was rarely angry in his personal contacts with others, although could become <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> felt that his integrity was being challenged. He {{had a tendency to}} be highly trusting, something which some of those close to whom sometimes believed was unwise in various situations.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the Jets' accomplishments, AFL {{teams were}} {{generally}} not regarded {{as having the}} same caliber of talent as NFL teams. However, {{three days before the}} game, an intoxicated Namath appeared at the Miami Touchdown Club and boldly predicted to the audience, [...] "We're gonna win the game. I guarantee it." [...] Jets' head coach Weeb Ewbank, in an NFL Films segment, once joked that he [...] "could have shot" [...] Namath for the statement. Namath made his famous [...] "guarantee" [...] in response to a rowdy Colts supporter at the club, who boasted the Colts would easily defeat the Jets. Namath said he never intended to make such a public prediction, and never would have done <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had not been confronted by the fan. Nevertheless, his comments and subsequent performance in the game itself are one of the more famous instances in NFL lore.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} of Van Gogh's {{activities}} during the two years {{he lived with his}} brother, Theo, in Paris, 1886–1888. The fact that he had painted Sunflowers already is only revealed in the spring of 1889, when Gauguin claimed one of the Arles versions in exchange for studies he had left behind after leaving Arles for Paris. Van Gogh was upset and replied that Gauguin had absolutely no right to make this request: [...] "I am definitely keeping my sunflowers in question. He has two of them already, let that hold him. And if he is not satisfied with the exchange he has made with me, he can take back his little Martinique canvas, and his self-portrait sent me from Brittany, at the same time giving me back both my portrait and the two sunflower canvases which he has taken to Paris. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> ever broaches this subject again, I've told you just how matters stand." ...|$|E
2500|$|... in 158 B. C. E. Hipparchus {{computed}} a very erroneous {{summer solstice}} from Callippus's calendar. He observed the summer solstice in 146 and 135 both [...] {{to a few}} hours, but observations of the moment of equinox were simpler, and he made twenty during his lifetime. Ptolemy gives an extensive discussion of Hipparchus's work {{on the length of}} the year in the Almagest III.1, and quotes many observations that Hipparchus made or used, spanning 162–128. [...] of Hipparchus's seventeen equinox observations made at Rhodes shows that the mean error in declination is positive seven arc minutes, nearly agreeing with the sum of refraction by air and Swerdlow's parallax. The random noise is two arc minutes or more nearly one arcminute if rounding is taken into account which approximately agrees with the sharpness of the eye. Ptolemy quotes an equinox timing by Hipparchus (at 24 March 146 at dawn) that differs by 5 hours from the observation made on Alexandria's large public equatorial ring that same day (at 1 hour before noon): Hipparchus may have visited Alexandria but he did not make his equinox observations there; presumably he was on Rhodes (at nearly the same geographical longitude). He could have used the equatorial ring of his armillary sphere or another equatorial ring for these observations, but Hipparchus (and Ptolemy) knew that observations with these instruments are sensitive to a precise alignment with the equator, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were restricted to an armillary, it would make more sense to use its meridian ring as a transit instrument. The problem with an equatorial ring (if an observer is naive enough to trust it very near dawn or dusk) is that atmospheric refraction lifts the Sun significantly above the horizon: so for a northern hemisphere observer its apparent declination is too high, which changes the observed time when the Sun crosses the equator. (Worse, the refraction decreases as the Sun rises and increases as it sets, so it may appear to move in the wrong direction with respect to the equator in the course of the ...|$|E
