When it was put to the Chairman of the Basset Hound Club that they were breeding deformed congenital dwarfs, he rejected that accusation, claiming that current Basset Hounds look very much like those of the 1800s.

Graduates of the training program established carp farms.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} brochs {{is a subject}} of {{continuing}} research. <b>Sixty</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> most archaeologists believed that brochs, usually regarded as the 'castles' of Iron Age chieftains, were built by immigrants who had been pushed northward after being displaced first by the intrusions of Belgic tribes into what is now southeast England {{at the end of}} the second century BC and later by the Roman invasion of southern Britain beginning in AD 43. Yet there is now little doubt that the hollow-walled broch tower was purely an invention in what is now Scotland; even the kinds of pottery found inside them that most resembled south British styles were local hybrid forms. The first of the modern review articles on the subject (MacKie 1965) did not, as is commonly believed, propose that brochs were built by immigrants, but rather that a hybrid culture formed from the blending of a small number of immigrants with the native population of the Hebrides produced them in the first century BC, basing them on earlier, simpler, promontory forts. This view contrasted, for example, with that of Sir Lindsay Scott, who argued, following Childe (1935), for a wholesale migration into Atlantic Scotland of people from southwest England.|$|E

Previously havens for wild animals from {{elephants}} to giraffes, and for predators such as lions and cheetahs, the riverbeds are now mostly grazing spots, though leopards and cheetahs can still be found. The area is now heavily grazed and cattle fences restrict the movement of wildlife. Among deserts of the Southern Hemisphere, the Kalahari most closely resembles some Australian deserts in its latitude and its mode of formation. The Kalahari Desert came into existence approximately <b>sixty</b> million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> along {{with the formation of}} the African continent.|$|R

2500|$|There are two archeological zones/former {{ceremonial}} {{sites in}} El Lobo and a cave {{area in the}} community of Neblinas. There are small indigenous temples in Potero del Llano, Agua Zarca, El Sabinito and La Campana, which contain stone and clay idols linked to the Pame, Huasteco and Jonaz cultures. The La Campana site in the municipality has been sacked and destroyed, despite recent measures taken to protect local sites. The crime was reported by archeologists María Teresa Muñoz Espinoza and José Carlos Castañeda Reyes, who state that {{this is the most important}} site of the area. The site belongs to the Huasteca culture and dated to about 600 CE. It is located between the communities of La Campana and Las Ánimas. [...] The site has also been damaged by landslides, possibly provoked by the illegal mining of white sand in the area. This is where the worst damage to the site is. The site measures thirty eight meters long and five meters in depth. Thefts include a complete burial with various ceramic objects. A large grinding stone was destroyed intentionally. The site was discovered about <b>sixty</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> but there has been no budget to excavate it formally. However, there have been about 160 structured counted including platforms, plazas, patios and more. There is a push to cover and protect the area, especially that closest to where the sand mining occurs.|$|E

Then too, I have had the benefit of John Buchan's history of The South African Forces in France to check dates and to obtain official records of casualties suffered by individual regiments. Memories are very strange; in times of stress they imprint themselves indelibly on the mind, yet often leaving out events seen later in more placid times. I can look back and picture vividly the incidents I have related. I have memories of many wonderful comrades who fell in those hectic days and who went to their deathswith a song. To these, I humbly dedicate my tale of experiences in three theatres of the Great War. </p...|$|R
