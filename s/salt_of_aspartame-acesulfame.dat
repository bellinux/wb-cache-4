40|$|What are {{potassium}} <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> {{fatty acids}}? Potassium <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> fatty acids are commonly called soap salts. They {{are used as}} insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and algaecides. The first pesticide product containing soap salts was registered for use in 1947 (1). Potassium <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> fatty acids are produced by adding potassium hydroxide to fatty acids found in animal fats and in plant oils. Fatty acids are extracted from palm, coconut, olive, castor, and cottonseed plants to form this active ingredient (2). Soap salts are derived from fatty acids with carbon chain lengths of 12 - 18 saturated carbons, and chain lengths of 18 carbons {{with one or more}} double bonds (unsaturated). Potassium salts may include oleate, laureate, myristate, and ricinoleate (1). Some potassium <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> fatty acids are used as multi-purpose food additives. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies them as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) (3). Residues from the use of this active ingredient, in accordance with labeling guidelines, are not anticipated to exceed levels that occur naturally, or levels that are intentionally added to food. Potassium <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> fatty acids have been exempt from United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tolerances for food and feed crops since 1982 (1, 4). Except for basic product identity, chemical studies, and acute ecotoxicity studies, the EPA waived toxicology requirements under 40 CFR Part 158 for potassium <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> fatty acids and relied on published data (1).
