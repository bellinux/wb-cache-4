40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} whether the addition of different herbal oils (anise, <b>sweet</b> basil, blue <b>chamomile,</b> clove, true cinnamon, common sage) into whey will extend its shelf life. Changes in pH, titration acidity and microbiological analysis of whey during storage life were chosen as parameters for monitoring of whey shelf life. Based on these analyses possibility of utilization of herbal oils has been confirmed for the purpose of extension of the lifetime of whey. The use of essential oils blue chamomile and common sage did not help to extend the shelf life of fresh whey. The treatment of whey by herbal essential oils anise, sweet basil, clove and cinnamon extend the shelf life up to 21 days without significant changes in pH and titratable acidity. The results of our study show that essential oils could be used to inhibit microbial spoilage whey and to prolong its shelf life...|$|R
