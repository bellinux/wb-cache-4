40|$|The {{persistent}} {{increase of}} government debt in Malaysia {{in the recent}} years has raised con-cerns as to whether the borrowings have spurred the economy or became a drag on econom-ic growth. The present paper investigates the real effect of government debt on <b>sustainable</b> economic <b>growth</b> in Malaysia using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag approach for the period of 1970 - 2015. The results show there are positive significant long- and short-run relationships between government debt and <b>sustainable</b> economic <b>growth.</b> There is also a unidirectional causality running from government debt to <b>sustainable</b> economic <b>growth.</b> The findings indicate that Malaysia’s government debt is an important macroeconomic element for sustainability of economic growth in Malaysia.

25|$|Education is a {{critical}} input in human resource development and essential for the country's economic growth. It increases the productivity and efficiency of individuals, and it produces a skilled labor force {{that is capable of}} leading the economy towards <b>sustainable</b> <b>growth</b> and prosperity. The progress and wellbeing of a country largely depends on the education choices made available to its people. It {{can be one of the}} most powerful instruments of change. It can help a country to achieve its national goals via producing minds imbued with knowledge, skills, and competencies to shape its future destiny. The widespread recognition of this fact has created awareness on the need to focus upon literacy and elementary education, not simply as a matter of social justice but more to foster economic growth, social well-being, and social stability. Women's education is so inextricably linked with the other facets of human development that to make it a priority is to also make change on a range of other fronts; from the health and status of women to early childhood care; from nutrition, water and sanitation to community empowerment; from the reduction of child labor and other forms of exploitation to the peaceful resolution of conflicts.|$|E
