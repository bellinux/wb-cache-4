500|$|The most {{profitable}} furs {{were those of}} sea otters, especially the northern sea otter, Enhydra lutris kenyoni, which inhabited the coastal waters between the Columbia River {{in the south to}} the Aleutian Islands in the north. The sea otter was the most hunted during the Maritime Fur Trade during the 17th and 18th centuries. Sea otters possess a thicker fur than any other mammal, and the sea otter's habit of grooming their coat prevents molting. The reason for their exploitation was due to this 'dark [...] and silver tipped fur'. The popularity and demand in fashion of sea otter pelts in China {{was one of the reasons}} why it was hunted to the point of disappearance. These mammals of the Pacific are currently 'listed as Threatened under the Canadian Species at Risk Act'. Sea otter distribution extends from the north of Japan all the way to the vicinity of Cedros Island, Mexico. The species stayed approximately within the arc of the Northern Pacific until the pressure of the maritime trade forced them to move north. The start of their decline with the first Russian expeditions in this region. Aleut hunters were the providers of the skins to the Russians; the former became 'the main purveyor of prime otter skins to Russian traders and American adventurers'. Before the exploitation of these mammals, their population ranged from 150,000 to 300,000. Sea otters are 'slow breeders, only one sometimes two pups [...] being born at a time' which does not help the population when being pursued. The Chinese sought this mammal's fur due to its great commercial value and its 'prime coat' all year long. The pelt was used by the wealthy Chinese as clothing decoration (robe trimming) and the Russians used it as an ornamental piece. The other furs that were sent to Europe and America were changed to 'coat collars or hats'. Due to this great demand and worth of the sea otters pelt, the Russian-America Company (RAC) annual expenses was around 1000,000 rubles each year and profited over 500,000 rubles per year. The fur of the Californian <b>southern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>otter,</b> E. l. nereis, was less highly prized and thus less profitable.

5|$|For <b>southern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> to be {{considered}} for removal from threatened species listing, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) determined that the population should exceed 3,090 for three consecutive years. In response to recovery efforts, the population climbed steadily from the mid-20th century through the early 2000s, then remained relatively flat from 2005–2014 at just under 3,000. There was some contraction from the northern (now Pigeon Point) and southern limits of the <b>sea</b> <b>otter's</b> range during the end of this period, circumstantially related to an increase in lethal shark bites, raising concerns that the population had reached a plateau.

40|$|The {{integration}} of physiological and behavioral studies can yield valuable information {{important to the}} conservation and management of imperiled species. In the following chapters, I examine a suite of physiological characteristics and behavioral attributes of <b>southern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> (Enhydra lutris nereis) {{across a variety of}} life stages and discuss resulting population level consequences in this threatened species. In my first data chapter (Chapter 2), I use open-flow respirometry to determine age- and activity- specific metabolic rates of immature <b>southern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> throughout ontogeny. These data are then combined with activity budgets of wild <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> to determine the energetic cost of pup rearing for adult females. In Chapter 3, I determine age-specific oxygen storage capacity and diving abilities of <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> from birth through adulthood. Finally, in Chapter 4, I examine the foraging behavior of <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> off the coast of central California. I found that <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> pups have elevated mass-specific metabolic rates in comparison to adult conspecifics, which are highest for molting pups and begin to approach adult levels around the average age of weaning (6 mo.). In addition, immature <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> have limited blood and muscle oxygen stores throughout dependency, which result in a limited capacity for diving and high dependence on adult females throughout lactation. The high energetic demands of pups result in elevated field metabolic rates (FMR) for lactating females. Female FMR is increased 17 % by three weeks postpartum and continues to increase throughout lactation. By the average age of weaning female FMR is increased 96 % above pre-pregnancy levels. These heightened energetic demands are reflected in the foraging behavior of wild <b>sea</b> <b>otters.</b> Adult females appear behaviorally constrained by dependent young during an already energetically costly life stage. Both physiological and behavioral data suggest that it takes <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> approximately two years to develop comparable diving abilities to adults; however, individuals at this stage are likely inefficient foragers when compared to adults. Together these data indicate that late-lactation and the first years post-weaning are the most physiologically challenging life stages for <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> and that these groups are likely the most sensitive to disturbance and resource limitation. The high energetic demands of dependent pups influence body condition, parental provisioning strategies, and life history decisions in adult females. In addition, high energy demands, physiological limitations, and behavioral naïveté make maintaining positive energy balance difficult for juvenile and sub-adult <b>sea</b> <b>otters.</b> Ultimately, these chapters provide novel information regarding age-specific energy demands, physiological abilities, and foraging behavior of <b>southern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> across a variety of life stages, and elucidate mechanisms underlying current population level trends...|$|R

40|$|The {{association}} among anthropogenic environmental disturbance, pathogen {{pollution and}} the emergence of infectious diseases in wildlife has been postulated, but not always well supported by epidemiological data. Specific evidence of coastal contamination of the marine ecosystem with the zoonotic protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, and extensive infection of <b>southern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> (Enhydra lutris nereis) along the California, USA coast was documented by this study. To investigate the extent of exposure and factors contributing to the apparent emergence of T. gondii in <b>southern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>otters,</b> we compiled environmental, demographic and serological data from 223 live and dead <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> examined between 1997 and 2001. The T. gondii seroprevalence was 42 % (49 / 116) for live otters, and 62 % (66 / 107) for dead otters. Demographic and environmental data were examined for associations with T. gondii seropositivity, with the ultimate goal of identifying spatial clusters and demographic and environmental risk factors for T. gondii infection. Spatial analysis revealed clusters of T. gondii-seropositive <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> at two locations along the coast, and one site with lower than expected T. gondii seroprevalence. Risk factors that were positively associated with T. gondii seropositivity in logistic regression analysis included male gender, older age and otters sampled from the Morro Bay region of California. Most importantly, otters sampled near areas of maximal freshwater runoff were approximately {{three times more likely to}} be seropositive to T. gondii than otters sampled in areas of low flow. No association was found between seropositivity to T. gondii and human population density or exposure to sewage.

With conservation efforts, including the crucial pioneering of Monterey marine protected area by Julia Platt and Margaret Wentworth Owings and the Friends of the Sea Otter organization, this group has since grown and expanded its range. However, recovery has been slow in comparison to sea otter populations elsewhere, and also in comparison to sympatric marine mammal species such as California sea lions and harbor seals.

5|$|Although the <b>southern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>otter's</b> range has {{continuously}} {{expanded from}} the remnant {{population of about}} 50 individuals in Big Sur since protection in 1911, however from 2007 to 2010, the otter population and its range contracted and since 2010 has made little progress. As of spring 2010, the northern boundary had moved from about Tunitas Creek to a point 2km southeast of Pigeon Point, and the southern boundary has moved from approximately Coal Oil Point to Gaviota State Park. Recently, a toxin called microcystin, produced by a type of cyanobacteria (Microcystis), seems to be concentrated in the shellfish the otters eat, poisoning them. Cyanobacteria are found in stagnant freshwater enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus from septic tank and agricultural fertilizer runoff, and may be flushed into the ocean when streamflows are high in the rainy season. A record number of <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> carcasses were found on California's coastline in 2010, with increased shark attacks an increasing component of the mortality.

40|$|Analyses {{of blood}} and liver samples from live {{captured}} <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> and liver samples from beachcast <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> carcasses off the remote Washington coast indicate relatively low exposure to contaminants, but suggest that even at the low levels measured, exposure may be indicated by biomarker response. Evidence of pathogen exposure is noteworthy - infectious disease presents a potential risk to Washington <b>sea</b> <b>otters,</b> particularly due to their small population size and limited distribution. During 2001 and 2002, 32 <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> were captured, of which 28 were implanted with transmitters to track their movements and liver and blood samples were collected to evaluate contaminant and pathogen exposure. In addition, liver samples from fifteen beachcast animals that washed ashore between 1991 and 2002 were analyzed to provide historical information and a basis of reference for values obtained from live otters. The results indicate low levels of metals, butyltins, and organochlorine compounds in the blood samples, {{with many of the}} organochlorines not detected except polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and a few aromatic hydrocarbons detected in the liver of the live captured animals. Aliphatic hydrocarbons were measurable in the liver from the live captured animals; however, some of these are likely from biogenic sources. A significant reduction of vitamin A storage in the liver was observed in relation to PCB, dibutyltin and octacosane concentration. A significant and strong positive correlation in vitamin A storage in the liver was observed for cadmium and several of the aliphatic hydrocarbons. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cytochrome P 450 induction was elevated in two of 16 animals and may be potentially related to aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon exposure. Mean concentration of total butyltin in the liver of the Washington beach-cast otters was more than 15 times lower than the mean concentration reported by Kannan et al. (1998) for <b>Southern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> in California. Organochlorine compounds were evident in the liver of beach-cast animals, despite the lack of large human population centers and development along the Washington coast. Concentrations of PCBs and chlordanes (e. g., transchlordane, cis-chlordane, trans-nonachlor, cis-nonachlor and oxychlordane) in liver of Washington beach-cast <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> were similar to those measured in Aleutian and California <b>sea</b> <b>otters,</b> excluding those from Monterey Bay, which were higher. Mean concentrations of 1, 1, 1,- trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophyenyl) ethanes (DDTs) were lower, and mean concentrations of cyclohexanes (HCH, e. g., alpha BHC, beta BHC, delta BHC and gamma BHC) were slightly higher in Washington beach-cast otters versus those from California and the Aleutians. Epidemiologically, blood tests revealed that 80 percent of the otters tested positive for morbillivirus and 60 percent for Toxoplasma, the latter of which has been a significant cause of mortality in <b>Southern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> in California. This is the first finding of positive morbillivirus titers in <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> from the Northeast Pacific. Individual deaths may occur from these diseases, perhaps more so when animals are otherwise immuno-compromised or infected with multiple diseases, but a population-threatening die-off from these diseases singly is unlikely while population immunity remains high. The high frequency of detection of morbillivirus and Toxoplasma in the live otters corresponds well with the cause of death of stranded Washington <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> reported herein, which has generally been attributable to infectious disease. Washington’s <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> population continues to grow, with over 1100 animals currently inhabiting Washington waters; however, the rate of growth has slowed over recent years. The population has a limited distribution and has not yet reached its carrying capacity and as such, is still considered at high risk to catastrophic events. (PDF contains 189 pages...|$|R
40|$|Super-blooms" of {{cyanobacteria}} {{that produce}} potent and environmentally persistent biotoxins (microcystins) are an emerging global health issue in freshwater habitats. Monitoring {{of the marine}} environment for secondary impacts has been minimal, although microcystin-contaminated freshwater {{is known to be}} entering marine ecosystems. Here we confirm deaths of marine mammals from microcystin intoxication and provide evidence implicating land-sea flow with trophic transfer through marine invertebrates as the most likely route of exposure. This hypothesis was evaluated through environmental detection of potential freshwater and marine microcystin sources, <b>sea</b> <b>otter</b> necropsy with biochemical analysis of tissues and evaluation of bioaccumulation of freshwater microcystins by marine invertebrates. Ocean discharge of freshwater microcystins was confirmed for three nutrient-impaired rivers flowing into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and microcystin concentrations up to 2, 900 ppm (2. 9 million ppb) were detected in a freshwater lake and downstream tributaries to within 1 km of the ocean. Deaths of 21 <b>southern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>otters,</b> a federally listed threatened species, were linked to microcystin intoxication. Finally, farmed and free-living marine clams, mussels and oysters of species that are often consumed by <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> and humans exhibited significant biomagnification (to 107 times ambient water levels) and slow depuration of freshwater cyanotoxins, suggesting a potentially serious environmental and public health threat that extends from the lowest trophic levels of nutrient-impaired freshwater habitat to apex marine predators. Microcystin-poisoned <b>sea</b> <b>otters</b> were commonly recovered near river mouths and harbors and contaminated marine bivalves were implicated as the most likely source of this potent hepatotoxin for wild otters. This is the first report of deaths of marine mammals due to cyanotoxins and confirms the existence of a novel class of marine "harmful algal bloom" in the Pacific coastal environment; that of hepatotoxic shellfish poisoning (HSP), suggesting that animals and humans are at risk from microcystin poisoning when consuming shellfish harvested at the land-sea interface...|$|R
