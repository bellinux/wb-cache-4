25|$|The Australian <b>Synroc</b> (synthetic rock) {{is a more}} {{sophisticated}} way to immobilize such waste, and this process may eventually come into commercial use for civil wastes (it is currently being developed for US military wastes). <b>Synroc</b> was invented by Prof Ted Ringwood (a geochemist) at the Australian National University. The <b>Synroc</b> contains pyrochlore and cryptomelane type minerals. The original form of <b>Synroc</b> (<b>Synroc</b> C) was designed for the liquid high level waste (PUREX raffinate) from a light water reactor. The main minerals in this <b>Synroc</b> are hollandite (BaAl2Ti6O16), zirconolite (CaZrTi2O7) and perovskite (CaTiO3). The zirconolite and perovskite are hosts for the actinides. The strontium and barium will be fixed in the perovskite. The caesium will be fixed in the hollandite.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{borosilicate}} glass, {{which is}} amorphous, <b>Synroc</b> is a ceramic that incorporates the radioactive waste into its crystal structure. Naturally occurring rocks can store radioactive materials for long periods. The aim of <b>Synroc</b> is to imitate this by converting liquid into a crystalline structure and use to store radioactive waste.

50|$|As an {{alternative}} to the disposal of the PUREX raffinate in glass or <b>Synroc,</b> the most radiotoxic elements can be removed through advanced reprocessing. After separation, the minor actinides and some long-lived fission products can be converted to short-lived isotopes by either neutron or photon irradiation. This is called transmutation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Synroc</b> is {{composed}} of three titanate minerals - hollandite, zirconolite and perovskite - plus rutile and {{a small amount of}} metal alloy. These are combined into a slurry to which is added a portion of high-level liquid nuclear waste. The mixture is dried and calcined at 750 C to produce a powder.|$|E
50|$|Different {{types of}} <b>Synroc</b> waste forms (ratios of {{component}} minerals, specific HIP pressures and temperatures etc.) {{can be developed}} for the immobilisation {{of different types of}} waste. Only zirconolite and perovskite can accommodate actinides. The exact proportions of the main phases vary depending on the HLW composition. For example, Synroc-C is designed to contain about 20 wt.% of calcined HLW and it consists of approximately (in wt.%): 30 — hollandite; 30 — zirconolite; 20 — perovskite and 20 — Ti-oxides and other phases. Immobilising weapons-grade plutonium or transuranium wastes instead of bulk HLW may essentially change the <b>Synroc</b> phase composition to primarily zirconolite-based or a pyrochlore-based ceramic. The starting precursor for Synroc-C fabrication contains ∼57 wt.% TiO2 and 2 wt.% metallic Ti. The metallic titanium provides reducing conditions during ceramic synthesis and helps decrease volatilisation of radioactive cesium.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Most {{countries}} {{intend to}} dispose of their high-level radioactive wastes by converting them into a solidified wasteform {{which is to be}} buried within the earth. <b>SYNROC</b> is a titanate ceramic wasteform which has been designed for this purpose on the basis of geochemical principles. It comprises essentially rutile TiO 2, 'hollandite' Ba(A 1,Ti) Ti 6016, zirconolite CaZrTi 2 OT, and perovskite CaTiO a. The latter three phases have the capacity to accept he great majority of radioactive lements occur-ring in high-level wastes into their crystal attice sites. These minerals (or their close relatives) also occur in nature, where they have demonstrated their capacity to survive for many millions of years {{in a wide range of}} geological environments. The properties of <b>SYNROC</b> and the crystal chemistry of its constituent minerals are reviewed in some detail and current formulations of <b>SYNROC</b> are summarized. A notable property of <b>SYNROC</b> it its extremely high resistance to leaching by groundwaters, particularly above 100 ~ In addition, it can be shown that the capacity of <b>SYNROC</b> minerals to immobilize high-level waste elements is not markedly impaired by high levels of radiation damage. Current investigations are focused on developing a satisfactory production technology for <b>SYNROC</b> and progress to-wards this objective is described. The high leach-resistance of <b>SYNROC</b> at elevated temperatures increases the range of geological environments in which the waste may be finally interred; in particular, <b>SYNROC</b> is well adapted for disposal in deep drill-holes, both in con-tinental and marine environments. The fact that <b>SYNROC</b> is comprised of minerals which have demon-strated long-term geological stability is significant in establishing public confidence in the ability of the nuclear industry to immobilize high-level wastes for the very long periods required...|$|E

Phase equilibria are established in the CaO-TiO{sub 2 }-ZrO{sub 2 } system at 1, 200 C, using X-ray diffraction and electron probe microanalysis. The existence of two previously reported ternary phases, zirconolite (CaZrTi{sub 2 }O{sub 7 }) and calzirtite (Ca{sub 2 }Zr{sub 5 }Ti{sub 2 }O{sub 16 }), is confirmed. Each of these phases exhibits a significant range of homogeneity between TiO{sub 2 } and ZrO{sub 2 } while maintaining a nearly constant concentration of CaO. The ternary solubilities of the constituent binary phases are found to be negligible, with the exceptions of the perovskites, which display mutual solubility of at least 22 mol. % and may in fact form a series of continuous solid solutions. The solubilities of Hf and Gd in zirconolite are also investigated.

40|$|The {{first five}} year phase (Phase I) of this Co-operative program {{commenced}} in 1985 {{as a consequence}} of technical and diplomatic discussions is the early 1980 's. During Phase I, effective mechanisms of information transfer were established through personnel exchanges between JAERI and ANSTO, and a number of technical workshops. At the end of Phase I it was agreed that the Program should be extended into a second five-year period from 1990 to 1995, designated as Phase II. This latter phase was subsequently extended for a further three-year period from 1995 to 1998 to allow the collection of additional information on long-term accelerated damage tests and preparation of a final report. At the end of each phase of the Co-operative Program details results have been published in jointly-authored, formal documents. The key results, significance and recommendations of the entire Co-operative Program are summarised herein. The Co-operative Program has enhanced the excellent co-operative working relationship between the two institutions, and the arrangements developed under the original agreement should {{serve as a model for}} any other co-operative projects developed in the future. The main activities in the first phase of the Co-operative Program were the preparation, characterisation and subsequent testing of curium-doped <b>Synroc</b> containing simulated waste of the type produced by the PNC reprocessing facility at Tokyo in Japan namely JW-A containing elevated levels of Na. Here, the leach rates increased {{as a consequence of}} the radiation damage, due to (a) microcracking at a-doses corresponding to > 104 years of repository storage and (b) atomic displacements within the actinide-bearing phases, zirconolite and perovskite. At high doses, corresponding to > 3 x 104 years of storage, the former process led to leach rate enhancements of about a factor of 10 for Na and Ca, that were a further order of magnitude higher. Modifications to the <b>Synroc</b> composition were devised to prevent microcracking when the Na 20 content of the <b>Synroc</b> exceeds ~ 1. 5 wt%. In the second phase of the Co-operative Program, comparative studies were carried out on <b>Synroc</b> containing Na-free PW- 4 b waste and in this case, after ~ 105 years of equivalent storage, Sr and Ca leach rates increased by a factor of 10, whereas the leach rate of Ba which is not contained in the actinide host phases did not increase with equivalent storage time. The density decrease due to radiation damage was less in samples stored at 200 oC than at 30 oC. Complementary studies on Cm-doped single-phase zirconolite and perovskite were carried out and studies on naturally-occurring zirconolites were initiated to provide insight into the long-term durability of zirconolite over geological time. In both phases of the Co-operative Program, the preparation of the Cm-doped samples was carried out in JAERI'S WASTEF facility at Tokai, with technical input and assistance provided by ANSTO where necessary.
