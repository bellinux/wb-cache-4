This, however, can pose technical challenges on the reliable operation of the <b>small</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>system.</b> In this work, a technical analysis was carried out to investigate the implications of the planned pipeline of grid connected PV systems on Kiribati’s Tarawa power system. Variations in PV output and corresponding spinning reserve requirements to balance the short fall in the power output were analysed. The utility network was modelled using the PowerFactory software. Steady state and dynamic analyses were then carried out for the simulated scenarios. There were no major concerns identified at times of high load with high PV output. For low system demand with high PV output, dispatch constraints were identified. The current grid system will sustain maximum PV capacity above a load of 3250 kW but will require curtailment below this load. Dynamic simulations showed that fast negative ramps in the PV output can lead to frequency instability during a time of low demand and maximum PV output. The system is stable with PV curtailed at 900 kW if low loads and maximum PV output conditions exist...|$|E
40|$|Probabilistic {{methods have}} largely {{replaced}} deterministic techniques {{in the assessment}} of generating capacity adequacy in large modem electric power utilities. In spite of their widespread application in large systems, probabilistic methods are not generally applied to small isolated power systems. A recent survey [6] by Newfoundland & Labrador Hydro indicates that all Canadian small isolated systems employ some type of deterministic method to assess the adequacy of the existing or proposed generating facilities to meet the total load requirement. These approaches do not normally include any explicit recognition of system risk and do not provide comparable risks for systems of different size or composition. The reluctance by system planners of small isolated systems to accept probabilistic methods in their present form dictates a need to develop new approaches to bridge the deterministic methods and the prevalent probabilistic techniques. This thesis presents a new approach, known as system well-being analysis that links the accepted deterministic criteria with probabilistic methods. A description of the new evaluation techniques, new adequacy indices and comparative studies of the different indices and approaches are presented with the objective of providing practical probabilistic methods for capacity planning in small isolated power systems. A graphical user-interface software package named SIPSREL has been developed as a practical tool for <b>small</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>system</b> planning. It is hoped that probabilistic methods will be employed in practice in the adequacy evaluation of small isolated power systems using the methodologies and evaluation tools that have been developed in this research work...|$|E
40|$|Renewable energy {{application}} in electric power systems is growing rapidly worldwide due to enhanced public concerns for adverse environmental impacts and escalation in energy {{costs associated with}} the use of conventional energy sources. Photovoltaics and wind energy sources are being increasingly recognized as cost effective generation sources. A comprehensive evaluation of reliability and cost is required to analyze the actual benefits of utilizing these energy sources. The reliability aspects of utilizing renewable energy sources have largely been ignored in the past due the relatively insignificant contribution of these sources in major power systems, and consequently due to the lack of appropriate techniques. Renewable energy sources have the potential to play a significant role in the electrical energy requirements of small isolated power systems which are primarily supplied by costly diesel fuel. A relatively high renewable energy penetration can significantly reduce the system fuel costs but can alsohave considerable impact on the system reliability. Small isolated systems routinely plan their generating facilities using deterministic adequacy methods that cannot incorporate the highly erratic behavior of renewable energy sources. The utilization of a single probabilistic risk index has not been generally accepted in <b>small</b> <b>isolated</b> <b>system</b> evaluation despite its utilization in most large power utilities. Deterministic and probabilistic techniques are combined in this thesis using a system well-being approach to provide useful adequacy indices for small isolated systems that include renewable energy. This thesis presents an evaluation model for small isolated systems containing renewable energy sources by integrating simulation models that generate appropriate atmospheric data, evaluate chronological renewable power outputs and combine total available energy and load to provide useful system indices. A software tool SIPSREL+ has been developed which generates risk, well-being and energy based indices to provide realistic cost/reliability measures of utilizing renewable energy. The concepts presented and the examples illustrated in this thesis will help system planners to decide on appropriate installation sites, the types and mix of different energy generating sources, the optimum operating policies, and the optimum generation expansion plans required to meet increasing load demands in small isolated power systems containing photovoltaic and wind energy sources...|$|E

They are {{commonly}} installed in interconnected power systems by connecting each traction substation directly in different nodes among the network. The single-phase loads of high-speed railway systems do not produce excessive dangerous phase to phase unbalances in these robust networks. However, if high-speed trains are to be used in <b>small</b> <b>isolated</b> power <b>systems,</b> such as islands or non-interconnected power systems, problems of unacceptable phase to phase unbalances may appear. This is due to the small size of the system and its relatively weak network, that lead to a low short-circuit power in their nodes. This paper studies the impact of high-speed trains in <b>small</b> <b>isolated</b> power <b>systems.</b> Two different connections proposed by the infrastructure manager are analyzed. These connections try to reduce the impact of the railway network in power system network unbalances.

At the present time, wind and/or solar energy sources are utilized to generate electric power in many applications. Wind and solar energy will become important sources for power generation in the future because of their environmental, social and economic benefits, together with public support and government incentives.

The proposed methodology presents two major novelties in FSPN mod-eling, namely: 1) {{the introduction of}} a new kind of Petri net arc, called the database arc, which makes possible the direct import of real data in the simulation process; and 2) the selection of constant time intervals in FSPN modeling, instead of assuming continuous dynamics defined by the change of fluid level over time. Moreover, in order to construct the overall system model, this paper proposes a general framework for modular representation of the system under study following a number of well-defined steps. The obtained model is fully parameterized and compared to classical simulation methods, it provides to its user the additional advantage of graphical representation of system’s components and attributes.

Power generation is often demanded to small Diesel units with high generating costs: fuel supply and maintenance are often expensive phases in the chain of power generation; noise and air pollution can be a major constraint in a tourism based economy. Besides islands are likely to have a good wind potential. The overall reliability of island power systems is low if compared to the mainland and blackouts are not so rare events. The {{installation of}} renewable resources must therefore not get the situation worse and, if possible, improve the continuity and quality of supply. In fact, power fluctuations, which characterize renewable sources (wind, solar), can be very large compared to the system load, and the loss of a wind turbine due to any event (a fault or a wind gust) might cause the system to collapse.
