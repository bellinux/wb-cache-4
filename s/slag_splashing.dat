40|$|Abstract- Some {{variables}} {{that influence the}} <b>slag</b> <b>splashing</b> phenomenon in an oxygen steelmaking converter are numerically analyzed in this work. The effect of lance height, jet velocity, jet exit angle and slag viscosity on the washing and ejection mechanisms of <b>slag</b> <b>splashing</b> is studied in this work employing twodimensional transient computational fluid dynamics simulations. A parameter here called average slag volume fraction is proposed for the quantitative evaluation of the <b>slag</b> <b>splashing</b> efficiency. Besides, a qualitative comparison is made between the computational fluid dynamics results and physical model results from literature...|$|E
40|$|Converter off-gas, an {{important}} energy resource for steel industries, {{is one of}} the weak points in the recovery and utilization of secondary energy resources. To improve the level of recycling converter off-gas in steel plants, a novel approach to the recycle of CO 2 separated from converter off-gas or other off-gas for the green <b>slag</b> <b>splashing</b> technique was developed, and the CO 2 equilibrium conversion ratio of the green CO 2 <b>slag</b> <b>splashing</b> under different technological conditions was calculated by the program of enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and heat capacity (C), i. e. HSC software. Furthermore, the experiments of CO 2 injected into molten converter slag were curried out, and the influencing factors of the green <b>slag</b> <b>splashing</b> technique using CO 2 were analyzed. The experimental results showed that the carbon content for smooth <b>slag</b> <b>splashing</b> using CO 2 was about 4. 0 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The pile up of Magnesite Tailings {{cause serious}} {{environment}} pollution and mineral resources waste. When making the low-carbon steel or the ultra low-carbon steel in middle or small size converters, the slag superheat is always higher {{due to the}} higher tapping temperature. In {{order to reduce the}} tapping temperature, after blowing is also needed, which wil cause the contents of FeO in final slag get increased, the slag with lower viscosity, and the contens of MgO in final slag can’t get saturated. So <b>Slag</b> <b>Splashing</b> should not proceed immediately that we must slag Modifiers. The modifier was synthesized by calcined magnesite and anthracite powder，modifier takes the treatment of slag. The experimental result show that the slag has a higher melting point and a suitable viscosity to achieve the requirements of <b>slag</b> <b>splashing.</b> Induction There are lots of magnesite resources in the south of LiaoNing province in our country. But in the process of exploiting magnesite resources, the main minerals were exploited in traditional patterns. In such patterns, lean magnesite minerals were piled up as abandon and the rich were obtained, which caused a great waste of resources, formation of white pollution. In addition, such exploiting pattern seriously affected local environment and reduced the minerals-sevice...|$|E
30|$|Cu levels {{varied from}} 2.3 to 370  ppm, {{with a mean}} of 37  ppm. Samples from the early eighth century showed that the {{background}} level of Cu was around 5  ppm. The highest values (> 50  ppm) were observed in the samples from Site A, which was contaminated by copper <b>slag</b> that <b>splashed</b> out of the blast furnaces when the Nara Daibutsu was cast.|$|R
40|$|Splashing {{and wave}} {{formation}} {{has been studied}} experimentally by using one-seventh water model of CLU (Creusot-Loire Uddeholm) reactor with two different tuyere configurations by using paraffin and water as simulated slag and simulated metal respectively. Experimental results have been {{discussed in terms of}} total <b>splash</b> volume, relative <b>slag</b> volume in <b>splash</b> (dispersed-slag phase holdup in splash), wave frequency and wave amplitude with respect to gas injection rate and tuyere configuration at bath heights between 0. 25 m and 0. 38 m. Gas flow rates ranged from 0. 00599 m 3 /s to 0. 01312 m 3 /s. The results of splash measurements showed that splash volume increased with increasing gas flow rate and decreasing bath heights for both tuyere arrangements. However, off-centre configuration resulted in relatively higher amounts of <b>splash.</b> The <b>slag</b> volume in <b>splash</b> (Dph in splash) was also found to increase with decreasing bath heights and increasing gas injection rates. The high speed photography revealed that the frequency and wave amplitude increased with gas injection rate. The experimental results also showed that the frequency and vertical displacement of the rotating wave increased when the tuyere orientation became off-centered. This might be used to explain why off-center configuration resulted in generating higher splash volumes than the center configuration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} the bath shape, oxygen lance nozzles structure, and lance level on liquid steel mixing time and {{splashing}} amount were studied by experiment orthogonal design with 1 : 10 water model for 100 t basic oxygen converter modeling. The {{results showed that the}} stirring effect in the bath can be improved by changing the shape on the bath surface around the furnace wall with arc-shaped structure which can shorten the mixing time and reduce the liquid <b>slag</b> and steel <b>splashing</b> amount of the lining, and result in reducing metal lose and prolong the life of the lining...|$|R
