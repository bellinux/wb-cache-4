[...] This same portion of Nashville would later be known as Sulphur Spring Bottom and Sulphur Dell. In 1769, French-Canadian hunter Timothy Demonbreun began a series of trips up the Cumberland to Nashville and built a cabin near the lick to use as a base of operations for fur trapping during his visits to the area. Demonbreun settled in Nashville permanently in 1788, and ran a tavern and mercantile business.|$|E
50|$|The Salt Fork is {{the western}} tributary. It arises north of Urbana, flowing east toward Danville. It {{was named for}} the <b>saline</b> <b>springs</b> in its lower reaches.

50|$|The Illinois Salines were an {{important}} source of salt for prehistoric residents of Illinois. The earliest occupation of the site is speculated to have occurred during the Early Woodland Period; the site continued to be occupied through the Mississippian period. The salt excavated from the site was traded to other prehistoric sites in Illinois, as evidenced by the recovery of items from the <b>Saline</b> <b>Springs</b> at the Kincaid Site at the southern tip of Illinois. The <b>Saline</b> <b>Springs</b> are also {{an important}} site of prehistoric remains such as shells, bones, and other organic materials. Excavations at the site began in the mid-1800s and have continued through the 20th century. An archaeological project led by Southern Illinois University has studied the site since 1981.|$|R

On an old map this principal thoroughfare of Affton is described as the [...] "Road that led to the Salt Spring of Clamorgan in a wagon." [...] James Clamorgan was the name of an early Irish settler who came to Jefferson County and built a home south and east of what is now Fenton.

50|$|Mirabilite, {{also known}} as Glauber's salt, is a hydrous sodium sulfate mineral with the {{chemical}} formula Na2SO4·10H2O. It is a vitreous, colorless to white monoclinic mineral that forms as an evaporite from sodium sulfate-bearing brines.

40|$|Cyanobacterial {{community}} composition was studied along a salinity gradient {{from the}} <b>saline</b> <b>Spring</b> Fuliya towards {{the water column}} of Lake Kinneret. The samples included a gradient of salinities ranging from 4270 mg Cl L – 1 (<b>Saline</b> <b>Spring)</b> to 239 mg Cl L – 1 (Lake Kinneret). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and cloning of the 16 S rRNA gene, as well as cloning and sequencing of the psbA gene, were used to characterize cyanobacterial community composition. Despite the differences in salinity, similar cyanobacterial communities were observed in the lake and the <b>saline</b> <b>spring,</b> the only exception being the highest salinity sample (4270 mg Cl L – 1). Both, DGGE patterns and results of the clone libraries revealed the dominance of cyanobacteria with colonial Gloeocapsa and unicellular Synechococcus as the closest known cultured relatives, independently of the salinity. These results suggest that cyanobacterial populations inhabiting this freshwater lake and its saline sources can adapt {{to a wide range}} of salinities...|$|E
