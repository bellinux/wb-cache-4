5|$|From east of Highway35 and Highway115 to Cobourg, Highway401 {{passes through}} a mix of {{agricultural}} land and forests, maintaining a <b>straight</b> <b>course.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the viaduct, {{the parkway}} {{proceeds}} north as a four-lane highway on a <b>straight</b> <b>course</b> {{along the east}} bank of the channelized Don River, passing beneath Eastern Avenue and veering slightly to the east as it passes below Queen Street East.|$|E
5|$|Operation Skyburner: On 22 November 1961, a {{modified}} Phantom with water injection piloted by Lt. Col. Robert B. Robinson, set an absolute world record average speed over a 20-mile (32.2km) long 2-way <b>straight</b> <b>course</b> of 1,606.342mph (2,585.086km/h).|$|E

50|$|The board (mal-pan, 말판) is {{normally}} made of stitched cloth. The modern board is a rectangular shape, but historically {{there was also}} a round variation. There are four <b>straight</b> <b>courses</b> and two diagonal ones. Each of the <b>straight</b> <b>courses</b> comes with five stations, the diagonal ones have five stations, too, but one is shared. This brings the number of stations to twenty-nine in total. The board is also known to sometimes be drawn onto the floor.|$|R

5|$|After {{crossing}} into Greene County, {{the road}} intersects NY23A at an undeveloped junction. NY32 remains in its <b>straight</b> <b>course</b> through the lowlands below the escarpment, passing through mostly woodlands and the hamlet of Kiskatom, then winding around {{the north side}} of Cairo Roundtop before it joins with NY23 at Cairo. After , NY32 leaves the divided highway to once again strike north as a two-lane route. It trends west to its westernmost point until turning to the north-northeast just south of Freehold.|$|E
5|$|NY16 now {{follows the}} narrow valley of Ischua Creek, {{one of the}} Olean's tributaries, north past {{the road to the}} city's airport, north to Franklinville. NY98 joins NY16 just south of the village and leaves north of it. NY16 {{continues}} to Machias and the eastern end of NY242. A <b>straight</b> <b>course</b> takes the highway from this junction to the Cattaraugus Creek bridge. This bridge heads into Erie County.|$|E
5|$|The creek flows {{generally}} south-southwest {{through a}} narrow coastal watershed at the southern extreme end of the arid Los Angeles Basin in a fairly <b>straight</b> <b>course.</b> Owing to the submersion of Southern California in the Pacific Ocean as recently as 10million years ago, the creek flows over marine sedimentary rock that dates from the late Eocene to the Pliocene. The present-day form of the watershed, with its broad sediment-filled valleys and deeply eroded side canyons, was shaped by a climate change during the previous Ice Age that produced Aliso Canyon, the creek's final gorge.|$|E
50|$|The Warminster-Shaftesbury road {{ran through}} East Knoyle village. In the 20th century this {{became part of}} the A350 primary route between the M4 {{motorway}} and the south coast, and took a <b>straighter</b> <b>course</b> to the east of the village.|$|R

5|$|Friedrich Carl was an {{excellent}} sea boat; the ship was responsive to commands from the helm and had a moderate turning radius. She was somewhat unbalanced, however, and a 6degree rudder to port was required to keep the ship on a <b>straight</b> <b>course.</b> The ship's crew numbered 33 officers and 498 enlisted men, and while serving as a flagship, the crew was augmented with a command staff of 6 officers and 35 enlisted men. Friedrich Carl carried a number of smaller boats, including a large tender, two launches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy.|$|E
5|$|Rowing {{has existed}} {{along the river}} in Manchester and Salford since 1823. A regatta was inaugurated on 12 September 1842 on a <b>straight</b> <b>course</b> from Throstle's Nest Weir to Regent Road Bridge. Racing {{continued}} in Manchester with events such as Agecroft Regatta and Warburton Regatta. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, rowing was very popular in the area with many local clubs such as Nemesis, Prince of Wales, Minerva, Didsbury and Agecroft all competing regularly. With the decline in the condition of the water, by the Second World War only Agecroft and Broughton rowing clubs were still active.|$|E
5|$|The ship's crew {{consisted}} of ten officers and 122 enlisted men. She carried {{a number of}} smaller boats, including two pinnaces, two cutters, and one dinghy. Arminius was not a particularly successful design; she suffered from severe, fast rolling, especially in heavier seas. She also shipped {{a great deal of}} water over the bow and was unbalanced in steering. The ship turned rapidly to starboard but was sluggish in turning to port. Indeed, the ship was required to have the rudder at 15degrees to port in order to remain on a <b>straight</b> <b>course.</b> It was also impossible to control the ship with only sail power.|$|E
25|$|SH-33 and SH-47 swapped places west of US-283 on July 9, 1956; SH-47 {{proceeded}} due west of Roll to the Texas state line, while SH-33 {{passed through}} Cheyenne {{and turned toward}} the west south of there. This gave both highways <b>straighter</b> <b>courses</b> and resolved the wrong-way concurrency. However, the change was rescinded on August 13, 1956.|$|R

25|$|Because {{the railway}} took a <b>straighter</b> <b>course</b> than the canal, {{there are some}} {{locations}} where evidence for the canal can still be seen. A scenic walk has been created at Port Elphinstone, part of which follows a channel labelled Old Canal on Ordnance Survey maps, but this {{is thought to be}} of later construction than the canal, and served a mill.|$|R
25|$|Cricket balls can be bowled {{at close}} to 160km/h (100mph) by pace bowlers and made to deviate from a <b>straight</b> <b>course,</b> both in the air (known as 'swinging') and off the ground (known as 'seaming'). A spin bowler imparts lateral {{revolutions}} on the ball {{at the point of}} delivery, so that when it bounces it deviates from a <b>straight</b> <b>course.</b> As cricket bats have become thicker, the ball can now be hit well over 100 metres before touching the ground.|$|E
25|$|The river {{has been}} used for {{commercial}} shipping since time immemorial, but was straightened and improved many times including in 1753 and 1812. A <b>straight</b> <b>course</b> (new cut) was made at Bardney and the lock built in 1770 was re-built in 1865.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 {{the start}} of the <b>Straight</b> <b>Course</b> was {{relocated}} exactly 1 mile 550 yd from the finish. In the same year, moving pontoons were introduced at the start which allowed all boats, from singles to eights, to be aligned by the bows precisely on the start line. Since then all crews have raced a course of exactly one mile and 550 yards (2112 metres).|$|E
50|$|External {{walls are}} {{generally}} constructed of brick, rendered, or faced with stone in highly finished ashlar masonry, laid in <b>straight</b> <b>courses.</b> The corners of buildings are often emphasised by rusticated quoins. Basements and ground floors were often rusticated, {{as at the}} Palazzo Medici Riccardi (1444-1460) in Florence. Internal walls are smoothly plastered and surfaced with lime wash. For more formal spaces, internal surfaces are decorated with frescoes.|$|R

25|$|By 1961, SH-145 {{had been}} {{extended}} eastward to meet SH-19 once again east of Paoli. At this point, the highway {{served as a}} de facto Pauls Valley bypass, as SH-19 dipped down to the south to run through the Garvin County seat, while SH-145 continued on a <b>straight</b> <b>course.</b> The highway had also been nearly-entirely paved by this point, with only a short section near the eastern terminus still gravelled.|$|E
25|$|The {{stores that}} have been almost {{continuously}} lining the road abate shortly after the interstate when it makes its only deviation from its <b>straight</b> <b>course,</b> curving around the north campus of SUNY Buffalo, where it was relocated in the early 1970s. Past the campus and a nearby office park, the road narrows to two lanes in the small suburban hamlet of Getzville, where NY270 heads due north as Campbell Boulevard.|$|E
25|$|A straight-running torpedo has a gyroscope-based {{control system}} that {{ensures that the}} torpedo will run a <b>straight</b> <b>course.</b> The torpedo can run on a course {{different}} from that of the submarine by adjusting a parameter called the gyro angle, which sets the course of the torpedo relative to the course of the submarine (see Figure 2). The primary role of the TDC is to determine the gyro angle setting required to ensure that the torpedo will strike the target.|$|E
50|$|Built about 1840 in South Burlington, Vermont, Stone Cottage {{originally}} {{functioned as}} {{home to a}} family of five, including two children and an elderly parent. In later years the building served first as a school {{and then as a}} blacksmith shop. Constructed of limestone, the cottage’s stone exterior was laid in <b>straight</b> <b>courses</b> rather than in the more common scatterstone technique, creating lending the exterior walls an even, harmonious pattern.|$|R
50|$|The {{course is}} right handed, {{one and a}} half miles round and has a <b>straight</b> sprint <b>course</b> of five furlongs.|$|R

25|$|Now in {{the town}} of Wawarsing, NY52 bends {{southeast}} into an area that remains heavily forested along the next 10 miles (16km) as it gradually descends off the Catskill Plateau to Ellenville. The route follows a <b>straight</b> <b>course</b> to the southeast past the small residential hamlet of Dairyland, passing a junction with CR53A (Milk Road). Four miles (6.4km) further east, it passes another similar small hamlet, Greenfield Park, and bends back to the east a mile after passing the north end of Windsor Lake.|$|E
25|$|Highway535 is a {{generally}} straight route oriented in a northsouth direction through {{parts of the}} Canadian Shield. The two lane highway begins at a junction with Highway64 {{in the town of}} Noëlville, where it is known as David Street North. It proceeds directly north in a straight line for almost , crossing the Wolseley River en route. The highway eventually diverges from its <b>straight</b> <b>course</b> prior to crossing the French River at West Arm. It zigzags its way north through rough terrain for several kilometres, passing through several rock outcroppings.|$|E
25|$|Each {{event in}} the regatta {{takes the form of}} a {{knockout}} competition, with each race consisting of two crews racing side by side up the Henley course. The course is marked out by two lines of booms (wooden bars which float on the water, secured between vertical poles), which are placed along the river to form a <b>straight</b> <b>course</b> 2,112metres long. The course is wide enough to allow two crews to race down with a few metres between them. As such it is not uncommon for inexperienced steersmen or coxswains to crash into the booms, possibly costing their crew the race.|$|E
50|$|Competition at the Summer Paralympic Games {{consists}} of sprint races over a 200m <b>straight</b> line <b>course.</b> Eight different events are held.|$|R
25|$|On July 30, 2008, Sharp set an FAI class C1b {{world record}} for speed over a <b>straight</b> 3km <b>course</b> at 573.46km/h (356.33mph).|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Parthenocissus quinquefolia. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine starts with a {{relatively}} long contorted gallery with thin broken frass, or when it runs along margin in a <b>straighter</b> <b>course,</b> later abruptly enlarged into elongate blotch or wide gallery. Here, the frass is dispersed in the middle. The early narrow gallery may be {{as long as the}} elongate blotch. The mine can be found in any part of the leaf. The larvae are yellowish white with a black head.|$|R
