50|$|The Amos Chase House and Mill are a {{historic}} property on New Hampshire Route 114, {{just south of}} the Piscataquog River in Weare, New Hampshire. The house is a 2-1/2 Greek Revival two-family house built c. 1836. It has two similar five-bay facades (southeast and northeast) with central entries framed by pilasters and topped by architraves. The adjacent mill building is also a wood-frame structure, built c. 1849. Both buildings have seen only modest and <b>superficial</b> <b>alteration</b> since their construction. The mill is the only surviving 19th-century mill building in Weare, out of a cottage industry that once saw a dozen or more such buildings. This mill {{was the only one in}} the town to survive the New England Hurricane of 1938, although its waterwheel was washed away. The mill race providing water to the mill from the Piscataquog is still visible on the property, as is a dam built by Chase. Chase was a tool manufacturer; his son later used the mill in the manufacture of baskets.|$|E

Hydrothermal and <b>superficial</b> <b>alteration</b> processes formed minerals such as kaolinite, white micas, biotites, chlorites, tourmalines and epidote, {{all of which have}} diagnostics absorption features in the shortwave infrared region (SWIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from 2000 to 2400 nanometers. The study region is located in the southern portion of the Borborema Pegmatitic Province (BPP), in Northeastern Brazil. The Hyperion image was radiometrically corrected and converted to apparent reflectance. Mineral mapping was performed using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) hyperspectral classification technique. In areas where outcrops are well exposed it was possible to map pegmatite occurrences and to establish mineral zonation within pegmatitic bodies, based on differential mineral contents. However, mineralogical mapping was limited by the reduced areal extent of most of the pegmatites bodies, coupled with the 30 m spatial resolution of the sensor, {{as well as by the}} presence of vegetation and low surface concentrations of many minerals, such as tourmaline, biotites, chlorites and cookeite.

Method: The sample of this study was constituted by 120 test bodies (TB), as followed: 40 TB of composite resin (CR), 40 TB of conventional glass-ionomer cement (GIC) and 40 TB resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (RM-GIC). The TBs were immersed into the beverages, and submitted to positive control (Coke) in three exposition intervals: 5, 15 and 30 minutes. After expositions, the TBs were prepared for evaluation in scanning electron microscopy, where the datas were analyzed descriptively, taking into consideration the qualitative alterations of the sample. Results: Alterations were evidenced, promoted by the sugar cane broth on the surface of CR in the interval times of 15 and 30 minutes and on the surface of conventional GIC in the three exposition periods. The coconut water just affected the surface of CR in the intervals of 15 and 30 minutes. The surface of the restorations of GIC modified by resin didn’t present evaluation conditions in any of the intervals of time.

40|$|International audienceThe Malpica-Tui Unit (Galicia, NW Spain) records eclogite- and blueschist-facies {{metamorphism}} {{during the}} onset of the Variscan orogeny in Europe. Petrological analysis involving pseudosections calculated using THERMOCALC shows that the Upper Sheet of this unit, the Cea' n Schists, recorded a threestage metamorphic evolution involving (i) Early subduction-related medium-pressure ⁄ low-temperature metamorphism (M 1) constrained at 350 - 380 C, 12 - 14 kbar, which is only recorded in the basal part (lower metapelites, LM) of the Cea'n Schists. (ii) Subduction-related blueschist facies prograde metamorphism (M 2) going from 19 kbar, 420 C to 21 kbar, 460 C in the LM, and from 16 kbar 430 C to 21 - 22 kbar, 520 C in the structurally upper metapelites (UM). (iii) Exhumation-related metamorphism (M 3) is characterized by a decompression to 8 - 10 kbar, 470 - 490 C in the LM. This decompression is also recorded in the UM, but {{it was not possible to}} estimate precise P-T conditions. The calculations indicate that (i) the prograde evolution in subduction zones may occur in fluidundersaturated conditions due to the crystallization of lawsonite, even in metapelitic rocks. This significantly influences phase equilibria and hence the P-T estimates. (ii) The proportion of ferric iron also has a strong influence on phase equilibria, even in metapelites. However, the analysed values of Fe 2 O 3 may not reflect the oxidation state during the main metamorphic evolution and are probably easily modified by <b>superficial</b> <b>alteration</b> even in apparently fresh samples. The use of P-T-X(Fe 2 O 3) pseudosections together with petrographic observations is then necessary to estimate the real oxidation state of the rocks and correctly evaluate the P-T conditions...|$|E
40|$|Se elaboró un «Diseño {{experimental}} completamente al azar de efectos fijos y de arreglo factorial 32 » con dos factores y tres niveles: Materiales [vidrio volcánico coloreado (VVC), vidrio volcánico incoloro (VVI) y fragmentos de matriz (FM) ] y Reactivos [ácido húmico (AH), ácido oxálico (AO) y agua acidulada (AA) ]. La solubilidad se evaluó a través de la medida de dos variables maestras: pH, conductividad eléctrica (CE) y tres variables de control: aluminio (Al), silicio (Si) y hierro (Fe). Los FM presentaron mayor superficie específica, mayor superficie de reacción, mayor número de rasgos de alteración superficial y produjeron mayores cantidades de iones de Al 3 +, Si 4 + y Fe 3 + (72 %), seguido por los VVC (23 %). En los tres materiales a medida que transcurrió el tiempo, los tres reactivos tuvieron efecto muy agresivo sobre las superficies, formas y bordes. En los FM se evidenciaron mayores marcas o rasgos de alteración, en los VVI sólo se manifestaron a partir del segundo ciclo y fueron, por lo general, leves. 90 % de los datos se localizaron dentro del campo de estabilidad de la alofana/imogolita a pH entre 6. 0 - 7. 2 y actividad del H 4 SiO 4 entre 10 - 3. 2 - 10 - 4. 8, Un 7 % de los datos se localizaron en el campo de estabilidad de la haloisita cuando el pH disminuyó y la actividad del H 4 SiO 4 aumentó; 3 % lo hicieron en el de la gibsita, cuando disminuyó la actividad del H 4 SiO 4. Esto significa que en todos los casos para los tres materiales están las condiciones dadas para que se forme imogolita (alofana/imogolita). AH fue el reactivo que más extrajo Al, luego lo hizo AO. En ninguna de las reacciones los sistemas alcanzaron el equilibrio. Los procesos de disolución estuvieron gobernados por reacciones de primer orden durante el primer ciclo y de segundo orden en el segundo y tercer ciclos. &# 13; &# 13; Palabras claves: Vidrio volcánico, fragmentos de matriz, meteorización experimental, disolución, Cordillera Central colombiana. &# 13; &# 13; ABSTRACT&# 13; &# 13; To {{study in}} the laboratory the physical meteorization and chemistry of the womb fragments and of the volcanic glasses belonging to the North area of the Colombian Central Mountain range it was the central objective of this investigation.

The solubility was evaluated through the measure of pH, electric conductivity and three control variables: aluminum, silicon and iron. FM present bigger surface specific, bigger reaction surface, bigger number of features of <b>superficial</b> <b>alteration</b> and they are those that bigger quantities of ions of Al 3 +, Si 4 + and Fe 3 + topk place (72 %), continue to these the VVC (23 %). In the three materials {{it is observed that}} as it lapses the time, the three reagents, they go having a very aggressive effect on the surfaces, forms and borders of these, such effects are measured by the type of marks or prints, the intensity and the abundance of them. In those FM is where bigger marks or alteration features were evidenced in VVI they were manifested starting from the second cycle and they were, in general, light. 90 % of the data were located inside the field of stability from the allophane/imogolite to pH values among 6. 0 - 7. 2 and, to values of the activity of the H 4 SiO 4 among 10 - 3. 2 - 10 - 4. 8. 7 % of the data is located in the field of stability of the haloysite when the pH diminishes and the activity of the H 4 SiO 4 increases and, 3 % makes it in that of the gibbsite, when it diminishes the activity of the H 4 SiO 4. This means that in all the cases the given conditions were for the three materials formed imogolite (alophane-imogolite). The AH is the reagent that more it extracts to the, then makes it the AO, AA.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} the water absorbing behaviour (WAB) for assessment of the conservation state of stone in situ. A test methodology, consisting of a combination of techniques for in situ measurement of the WAB, was applied in a case study on Lede stone, a sandy limestone, used in a medieval facade in Ghent, Belgium. The methods used were the contact sponge method (CSM), the Karsten tube (KT) and the droplet method (DM). Additionally, the residual hardness of the stone was measured by Schmidt hammer (SH). After careful selection of representative measuring points, a qualitative analysis of the stone’s condition could be made, based on its WAB, residual hardness, reference data from laboratory experiments and thorough visual observations. From this analysis it could be concluded that CSM, KT and SH generated coherent and compatible results; that DM could indicate <b>superficial</b> <b>alterations</b> which were not necessarily representative for the subsuperficial WAB and that this methodology could give an insight on the conservation state, beyond visual observations, when combined with reference data...|$|R

40|$|Displacement maps were {{originally}} intended for mostly <b>superficial</b> <b>alterations</b> of polygonal models, while being artificially obtained {{by means of}} various raster graphics software. Now, though, with rapid development of graphics hardware and its constantly increasing level of programmability it becomes possible to apply or simulate displacement mapping in real time, which renders it a very promising technique for making polygonal scene visualisations look even more realistic. It is also possible to utilize the displacement approach for lossy (or even lossless, considering significant data overhead) 3 d-models compression algorithms. If combined with dedicated model compression methods and image and binary data compression algorithms, displacement mapping can result in dramatically improved overall compression ratios. In this article a complete life cycle of differential displacement maps is described, including proposed algorithm of GPU-based map creation and an algorithm of model restoration. It is shown that the described algorithm is capable {{of all of the}} features of conventional raytracing-based algorithms, while significantly outperforming them in terms of speed and feedback times, which renders it much more suitable for real life development process.

The experimental groups were divided according to {{the presence or absence of}} finishing and polishing and solutions (artificial saliva, 0. 05 % of manipulated sodium fluoride solution, Fluordent Reach, Oral B, Fluorgard). Specimens were immersed in each respective solution for 1 min per day, during 60 days and stored in artificial saliva at 37 +/- 1 degrees C between immersion periods. Topography and chemical analysis was qualitative. It was observed that specimens submitted to finishing and polishing procedures had lower superficial degradation.

Here we use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to follow the surface chemical changes that prolonged irradiation with soft X-rays (with maximum doses ranging from ~ 1. 2 x 1017 to ~ 3. 4 x 1017 photons cm- 2) produce on azurite, malachite and alizarin pigments and on two egg-yolk temperas containing azurite or alizarin. The effects following exposure to Argon ion irradiation have been also studied for malachite and azurite tempera. XPS spectra of the samples show that both types of radiation induce similar <b>superficial</b> <b>alterations,</b> although, at the selected experimental conditions, the modification rate is slower for exposure to soft X-rays. The highest radiation stability is shown for alizarin and, on the contrary, azurite and malachite experience a progressive chemical reduction of Cu 2 + to Cu+.

The Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging (LDPI) technique has been used to evaluate <b>superficial</b> <b>alterations</b> of the skin microcirculation in surgically induced murine hindlimb ischemia. We assessed the reproducibility and the accuracy of LDPI acquisitions and identified several critical factors that could affect LDPI measurements in mice. METHODS: Twenty mice were analysed. Statistical standardisation and a repeatability and reproducibility analysis were performed on mouse perfusion signals with respect to differences in body temperature, {{the presence or absence of}} hair, the type of anaesthesia used for LDPI measurements and the position of the mouse body. RESULTS: We found excellent correlations among measurements made by the same operator (i. e., repeatability) under the same experimental conditions and by two different operators (i. e., reproducibility). A Bland-Altman analysis showed the absence of bias in repeatability (p = 0. 29) or reproducibility (p = 0. 89). The limits of agreement for repeatability were - 0. 357 and - 0. 033, and for reproducibility, they were - 0. 270 and 0. 238. Significant differences in perfusion values were observed in different experimental groups.

Steel and glass fibres were used, and cement and lime mortars were employed as the matrices. The issue of durability of reinforced masonry structures, that is the transformation from sole masonry structures to hybrid ones, was investigated. Six brickwork columns (three unreinforced and three reinforced) and eighteen solid brick panels were built and tested (two unreinforced, 16 reinforced with steel cords or glass fibre). Tests were carried out in laboratory, and the results enabled the determination of the compression strength of the masonry before and after the application of the reinforcement, and before and after environmental effects. The main goal of the durability testing was to verify whether the artificial ageing process hinders the resistance. At the end of the cycles, a first visual observation was performed in order to evaluate if <b>superficial</b> <b>alterations</b> took place, such as efflorescence or micro cracking due to the immersion in the sodium chloride (NaCl) solution.

Elevated temperatures noticeably increase the moisture diffusion coefficient and moisture uptake behaviour. Measured changes in the tensile and in-plane shear mechanical properties were examined after 28, 56, 112 or 224 days. Tensile properties remained practically unaffected by aging whereas matrix dominated shear properties revealed an initial drop which was recovered to a substantial degree after further hygrothermal aging. Visco-elastic property changes due to the superimposing mechanisms of plasticization, additional cross-linking etc. were recorded. Scanning Electron Microscopy micrographs indicate that the fibre/matrix interface remained practically intact, even after the most aggressive hot/wet aging.

Aggregate morphometry was assessed by 2 D images from scanner via QUANTPORO software. The analyzed variables were: area, perimeter, aspect, roughness, Ferret diameter and compactness. Moreover, disturbed samples were collected at the same depths to determine particle size, aggregate stability in water, water-dispersible clay, clay flocculation index and organic matter content. It was observed that different soil management systems have modified soil aggregate morphology as well as physical attributes; and management effects’ magnitude increased from NT to P. </p...|$|R
40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} as an important human pathogen responsible for chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric cancer, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Little {{is known about the}} natural history of this infection since patients are usually recognized as having the infection only after years or decades of chronic disease. Several animal models of H. pylori infection, including those with different species of rodents, nonhuman primates, and germ-free animals, have been developed. Here we describe a new animal model in which the clinical, pathological, microbiological, and immunological aspects of human acute and chronic infection are mimicked and which allows us to monitor these aspects of infection within the same individuals. Conventional Beagle dogs were infected orally with a mouse-adapted strain of H. pylori and monitored for up to 24 weeks. Acute infection caused vomiting and diarrhea. The acute phase was followed by polymorphonuclear cell infiltration, interleukin 8 induction, mononuclear cell recruitment, and the appearance of a specific antibody response against H. pylori. The chronic phase was characterized by gastritis, epithelial <b>alterations,</b> <b>superficial</b> erosions, and the appearance of the typical macroscopic follicles that in humans are considered possible precursors of MALT lymphoma. In conclusion, infection in this model mimics closely human infection and allows us to study those phases that cannot be studied in humans. This new model can be a unique tool for learning more about the disease and for developing strategies for treatment and prevention...|$|R

Três pacientes encaminhados ao Laboratório de Doenças Externas Oculares em 2004 com alterações superficiais da córnea foram submetidos ao exame de citologia de impressão para investigação da presença de cistos de Acanthamoeba sp. Duas amostras foram obtidas da córnea de cada paciente e coradas com PAS, hematoxilina e Papanicolaou. Investigação microbiológica de rotina e cultura também foram {{realizadas}} após raspado da córnea. O cultivo das amostras e a citologia de impressão foram positivas para Acanthamoeba sp em todos os pacientes, ao passo que os raspados corados com Giemsa foram positivos em dois casos. A citologia de impressão revelou cistos de Acanthamoeba sp entre feixe de células epiteliais corneanas e como células isoladas. Foram observados cistos no epitélio de um dos pacientes com a citologia de impressão após três meses de tratamento, enquanto o raspado foi negativo. No exame anatomopatológico observaram-se cistos no epitélio e estroma de uma córnea receptora de um dos pacientes após transplante. Neste estudo, a citologia de impressão detectou com sucesso cistos de Acanthamoeba sp em pacientes com acometimento epitelial. Por tratar-se de método não invasivo, a técnica pode ser usada para facilitar o diagnóstico mais precoce da infecção por Acanthamoeba, sendo útil também no acompanhamento do tratamento da doença. To describe {{three cases}} of corneal infection due to Acanthamoeba sp in which {{was possible to}} detect Acanthamoeba sp cysts by the corneal impression cytology technique. Three patients referred to the External Eye Disease Laboratory in 2004 with <b>superficial</b> corneal <b>alterations</b> were submitted to corneal specimen collection by impression cytology filter paper to investigate the presence of Acanthamoeba sp cysts. Two impression cytology samples were obtained from each patient and were stained by PAS, hematoxylin and Papanicolaou. Routine microbiological investigation and culture were also performed using corneal scraping. Positive culture and impression cytology for Acanthamoeba sp was observed in all patients while smears with Giemsa stain were positive in two. Impression cytology Acanthamoeba sp cysts were observed among sheets of corneal epithelial cells and as isolated cells. Cysts were {{also found in the}} superficial epithelium in one of these patients after treatment while corneal scraping did not reveal any cyst. Histopathology revealed cysts in the epithelium and stroma in a transplanted cornea in one of these patients. The first description of impression cytology as a diagnostic method for Acanthamoeba keratitis occurred recently. In this study corneal impression cytology detected Acanthamoeba sp cysts successfully in these patients with only superficial involvement. Impression cytology as a non invasive technique can be used to facilitate early recognition of Acanthamoeba infection playing a useful role in the follow-up of the disease...|$|R
