60|$|They {{drew the}} <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> {{up to the}} head of the thing, and pulled it toward them several times, while their faces grew suffused and the veins rose gorged on their foreheads, for men in that country are proud of their vigor. There was a slow {{cracking}} and tearing of roots, but the great stump still stood immovable. Then the Shasta's engineer inquired what they fed upon, and their comrades flung them sardonic encouragement, while as they gasped and strained their muscles the screw slid slowly, turn by turn, through its socket. At last there was a sharp rending and a little murmur of applause as the big stump tilted and fell over on its side. Then the big rancher stood up on the veranda.|$|E
50|$|The GamerDock app {{allows users}} to {{customize}} a dynamic <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> that controls shortcuts to locations on the Gamerang site, as well as game control functionality on mobile devices such as the iPad or iPhone.|$|E
50|$|Early {{models have}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> safety {{that will not}} allow the pistol to chamber a round or cock the striker if the safety {{is not in the}} fire {{position}} when the slide is pulled back. Later models have a push up safety that will not allow the action to be cycled at all when engaged.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{noticeable}} changes during play covered improved shoot system and added power <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> during corner kicks.|$|R
50|$|In a {{double-acting}} steam engine, {{as used in}} {{a railway}} locomotive, {{the direction of the}} vertical thrust on the <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> is always upwards when running forward. It varies from nothing at the end of stroke to a maximum at half stroke when the angle between the con-rod and crank are greatest. When the crank-pin drives the piston, as when coasting, the piston thrust is downwards. The position of maximum thrust is shown by the increased wear at the middle of the <b>slide</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
30|$|Components of {{configuration}} panel are as follows: sensing range <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which sets sensing range of sensor; communication range <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which sets communication range of sensor; supersonic wave range <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which sets supersonic wave range of sensor; frame delay <b>slide</b> <b>bar,</b> which adjusts moving speed of sensor; sensing range checker, which checks if the sensing range of mobile sensor is visualized; communication range checker, which checks if the communication range of sensor is visualized; supersonic wave range checker, which checks if the supersonic wave range of sensor is visualized; node trace line checker, which checks if the distance in which sensor moved until the current time after being {{deployed in the}} beginning is visualized; goal coverage checker, which stops MSNS from operating when a user reaches the desired coverage; interval time checker, which pauses MSNS in operation during a certain time interval; degree K taker, which receives input {{of the number of}} neighboring sensors that sensors should maintain; number of sensor nodes taker, which receives input of the number of sensors to be deployed in the target area; initial deployment selector, which selects the initial location in which sensor are deployed when the MSNS starts; button to start and reset MSNS; and button to pause MSNS in operation and restart it.|$|R
5000|$|The Laramie has an {{automatic}} safety on the hammer {{consisting of a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>bar.</b> After each shot, the bar automatically positions itself between the hammer and the frame, preventing accidental discharge. [...] The bar also blocks the barrel releasing device and {{the rotation of the}} cylinder. The revolver can be transported safely when the hammer is in the half-cock notch, in this position the cylinder is able to rotate and the barrel can be opened for loading or unloading.|$|E
50|$|The transformer, oil {{operated}} {{main switch}} and stepping switch {{were located in}} the centre body. The power supply {{was obtained from the}} catenary via the two diamond-shaped pantographs mounted on each end body. At the start of a journey, both pantographs had to be lifted since they were only equipped with a single <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> without rocker. The cabinets for the reversing pole shunts and the brake resistors were mounted in front of the pantographs, towards the ends of the outer bodies.|$|E
50|$|The {{chromatic}} harmonica {{is a type}} of harmonica {{that uses}} a button-activated <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> to redirect air from the hole in the mouthpiece to the selected reed-plate desired. When the button is not pressed, an altered diatonic major scale of the key of the harmonica is available, while depressing the button accesses the same scale a semitone higher in each hole. Thus, the instrument is capable of playing the 12 notes of the Western chromatic scale. The chromatic harmonica can thus be contrasted with a standard harmonica, which can play only the notes in a given musical key.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Dirty Little Girl" [...] premiered on MTV on February 25, 2009. It was filmed on November 19, 2008 at The <b>Slide</b> <b>Bar</b> in Fullerton, California.|$|R
50|$|When {{still life}} scenes are stereographed, an {{ordinary}} single lens camera {{can be moved}} using a <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> or similar method to generate a stereo pair. Multiple views can be taken and the best pair selected for the desired viewing method.|$|R
25|$|The {{drive was}} on the {{trailing}} wheels and the <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> were attached to a motion bracket just behind the leading wheels. The wheels themselves had twelve spokes and very large balance weights. The front pair of wheels of the engine were partially enclosed in splashers which did not come above the running plate.|$|R
50|$|Most {{retractable}} doors use a {{spring-loaded roller}} {{very similar to}} a window blind, except the roller is mounted vertically when used in a door application. Screen material {{is attached to the}} roller while {{the opposite side of the}} material is attached to <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> riding on top and bottom tracks. The bar is moved back and forth to open or close the screen. The bar is usually held closed with a magnetic closure. Different types of mesh fabric options are available from standard fiberglass mesh, pet screen resistant mesh and solar screen mesh. The operation of the screens are manually or motorized.|$|E
5000|$|Tunnel Rats: 1968 is a first-person shooter {{with seven}} levels. Booby traps, such as {{tripwire}} grenades and trap doors, are located throughout the game world; trap doors are disarmed by locating an actionable point used to deactivate them. Tripwires are disarmed in a minigame where the player must stop a <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> within a specified zone; stopping within a narrower target also allows the player {{to collect the}} grenade {{that was part of}} the mechanism. [...] "Trophies", including dog tags from fallen GIs, and ears from the corpses of Vietnamese soldiers, can be collected to increase Brooks' health.|$|E
50|$|The lobster-tailed pot helmet had {{an oriental}} origin, being {{derived from the}} Ottoman Turkish 'chichak' (Turkish - çiçek) helmet, which {{developed}} in the 16th century. It {{was adopted by the}} Christian states of Europe in the early 17th century. The chichak was almost identical to the later European helmets - it had a forward projecting peak, <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> nasal, cheekpieces and neck guard; only its tendency to have a conical rather than rounded skull was distinctive. The European derivative of this helmet saw widespread use during the Thirty Years War when it became known as the zischägge, a Germanisation of the original Turkish name.|$|E
25|$|A {{minor change}} to the {{appearance}} of the streamlining was the removal of the locomotives' solid cowcatcher and its replacement with a lattice type, after it was discovered that the original design created a partial vacuum behind the cowcatcher, sucking dust and grime into the <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> for the centre cylinder, leading to maintenance problems.|$|R
40|$|Children {{playing on}} the {{playground}} in Sam Houston Park in Houston, Texas. The playground {{was built in the}} early 1900 's. The equipment originally included swings, climbing poles and ropes, a seesaw, giant strides, <b>sliding</b> <b>bars,</b> and a teeter ladder. The original equipment was made of wood, but it was later replaced with steel pieces...|$|R
50|$|Other, vendor-specific {{features}} can {{be implemented}} using standard controls, or combinations of them- for example, the solo bar on a Rock band guitar controller is implemented using the same controller buttons as the main fret buttons, plus an additional modifier key, whereas the <b>Slide</b> <b>Bar</b> from recent versions of Guitar Hero is simply another axis.|$|R
5000|$|A single camera {{can also}} be used if the subject remains {{perfectly}} still (such as an object in a museum display). Two exposures are required. The camera can be moved on a <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> for offset, or with practice, the photographer can simply shift the camera while holding it straight and level. This method of taking stereo photos is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Cha-Cha" [...] or [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] method. [...] It is also sometimes referred to as the [...] "astronaut shuffle" [...] because it was used to take stereo pictures {{on the surface of the}} moon using normal monoscopic equipment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{chromatic}} harmonica uses a button-activated <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> {{to redirect}} {{air from the}} hole in the mouthpiece to the selected reed-plate, though one design—the [...] "Machino-Tone"—controlled airflow by means of a lever-operated flap on the rear of the instrument. Also, a [...] "hands-free" [...] modification to the Hohner 270 (12-hole) lets the player shift the tones by moving the mouthpiece up and down with the lips, leaving the hands free to play another instrument. While the Richter-tuned 10-hole chromatic is intended to play in only one key, the 12-, 14-, and 16-hole models (which are tuned to equal temperament) allow the musician to play in any key desired with only one harmonica. This harp can be used for any style, including Celtic, classical, jazz, or blues (commonly in third position).|$|E
50|$|Spring bridge: Also {{known as}} Astig, this variety {{consists}} of a <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> connecting the lenses which can be separated through a gentle pull. The bar is telescopic, consisting of two sliders within a tube-like spring, which provides the tension. The nose pads are usually cork and are attached directly to the frames. They can either be hinged or static. This variety was popular from the 1890s to the 1930s, after which they were seldom seen. They were created and marketed as 'sporting pince-nez', which were purportedly more difficult to jar from the face than the other varieties {{as well as being}} more comfortable to wear for longer periods. A major advantage was that one size could often fit a wide variety of nose shapes and sizes. This style was usually available only as a frame, with rimless examples being very difficult to find.|$|E

5000|$|The {{locomotive}} had flat [...] "D" [...] type sliding valves {{which were}} actuated by Heusinger valve gear, with Laird type crossheads with single <b>slide</b> <b>bars.</b> To protect the motion from wind-blown {{sand in the}} Namib Desert, it had plate shields arranged along {{the full length of}} the engine, hinged on the running board to allow access to the motion.|$|R
50|$|During the night, {{the player}} takes {{control of their}} {{selected}} hero, and can run around the forest from a 3rd person perspective. A night can consist of 1-6 waves, each wave consisting of any number of enemies. You have an axe at your disposal along with a historically accurate musket that is muzzle loaded. Players must interact with certain traps, while others are automatic. Melee combat brings with it a Fear Factor or FF mechanic, which represents the amount of intimidation you have over your enemies, {{as long as they}} fear you, they will not attack. FF is represented by a <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> on the HUD, and acts as a physical representation for your enemy's next attack. Another mechanic during the night is the wind, players must keep track of it so they do not get detected by enemies. Midway through the game, players also obtain an item allowing them to manipulate the wind to help lure enemies to traps.|$|E
50|$|The {{shutter speed}} and {{aperture}} controls are {{located at the}} top of the camera. Shutter speed control is through a <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> which is marked B 25 50 100 and 200. The number 50 is red, the other numbers are black. The other side, next to the f stop numbers, has markings that say BRIGHT (in red), HAZY and CL'DY BRT (both black). These words have lines pointing to different f stops, depending on where the shutter speed is set. The Aperture lever has 9 positive clicks labeled 3.5, 4, (black dot), 5.6, (red dot), 8, 11, 16, 22. The red dot indicated f 6.3. These exposure suggestions are based on ASA 10 (not 100!) film which in 1954 was still the standard film for color slides just as it had been when the Realist was introduced. The recommended setting for bright sun was a shutter speed of 1/50th with an aperture of f 6.3.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a new suction tube for microsurgical procedures which permit a precise {{control of the}} pressure of suction. The new device consists of a suction tube connected to a laterally placed <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> which progressively opens or closes a leak. The surgeon can readily adjust the suction pressure by moving slightly the <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> with his thumb or index!nger up and down almost instantaneously...|$|E
50|$|An {{approach}} to slide guitar {{that does not}} use a bottleneck worn over a finger {{is to use the}} index and middle fingers to hold a weighted lighter (sold as the fireslide) against the strings. The middle, fourth and fifth fingers are used to fret between the slide and the bridge, allowing the player to perform <b>sliding</b> <b>barred</b> chords and scales.|$|R
40|$|We have {{implemented}} a visualization {{tool for the}} demonstration of a nonideal Carnot engine, operating at finite time. The cycle time can be varied using a <b>slide</b> <b>bar</b> and the pressure-volume, temperature-entropy, power-time, and efficiency-time diagrams change interactively and are shown on one screen. We have evaluated the visualization tool among engineering students at university level during an introductory course on thermodynamics and we review and discuss {{the outcome of the}} evaluation...|$|R
50|$|An {{interlocked}} yard is {{a railway}} yard where semaphore or coloured light signals are controlled {{in such a}} way that signals cannot be set to proceed unless the points that operate in conjunction with the signals are correctly set. A mechanical interlocking device is a system of rods, <b>sliding</b> <b>bars</b> and levers that are configured so that points cannot be changed in conflict, thus preventing movements that may cause a collision or other accident.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{technical}} {{factors such as}} analytical design and virtual prototyping, the simple but representative <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> was chosen in this paper and its mathematical model of working contour was established by using the analytic method. And then, the parameterized model and VRML file structural drawing of <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> were given by using double extrusion method. It was proved that {{the components of the}} tripod universal joint were formed easily by using the double extrusion method based on Extrusion nodes. In addition, the tripod universal joint assembly model was also accomplished by using Inline nodes and bottom-up assembling method...|$|E
30|$|For ranking {{the results}} of complex {{relationship}} searches on the semantic web, Anyanwu et al. [6] present a flexible approach called SemRank. In this method, {{with the help of}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> user can easily vary their search mode from conventional search mode to discovery search mode.|$|E
30|$|The buccal segment model {{consisted}} of five (from the second premolar {{to the central}} incisor) monocrystalline ceramic brackets [11]. The interbracket distance was set at 8.5 mm. The canine bracket was welded to a <b>sliding</b> <b>bar</b> that allowed different vertical positions, while the other brackets were mounted on a vice-like device. A section of a 0.0215 × 0.028 -in. stainless steel wire was used to align all the brackets.|$|E

5000|$|A steel <b>bar,</b> {{also called}} <b>slide,</b> play <b>bar</b> and bottleneck, is a musical {{apparatus}} {{which is used}} to play on steel guitars. The steel bar can be wound around the fingers or just held in the hand. Instead of pressuring the strings on the neck of the guitar, the steel <b>bar</b> <b>slides</b> over the strings, which produces a glissando effect.|$|R
50|$|Soon after {{entering}} service, problems were experienced with failing connecting rods, big end bearings breaking {{up as well}} as cracks developing in the motion girder of the Alligator crossheads. After investigations by SAR engineers with assistance from the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the crossheads, <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> and coupling rods were modified. The crossheads were converted to the multiple-bearing type with single guide bars while the three independent coupling rods were replaced with the more conventional single coupling rod with knuckle joints.|$|R
