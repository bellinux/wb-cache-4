50|$|It is from {{southern}} Italy that we receive {{the most enduring}} image of early Christian (and monastic) libraries and librarianship, {{in the person of}} Cassiodorus. Like no one else of his time, he leaves us a compendious work of bibliography, the Institituiones divinarum et saecularum litterarum, which surveys first Christian and then secular texts, providing notes and commentary along the way. An earlier attempt at Rome to establish a theological school had been frustrated, and so on his family’s estate at Calabria he established the “Vivarium”, as a setting in which “to incorporate <b>systematic</b> <b>theological</b> study into monastic life.” (Gamble, 1990) With this in view he assembled a large library of both Christian and Classical texts and designed a curriculum of study. He undertook his monastic and bibliographic work only after a long and well-rewarded career {{in the service of the}} Goths, and hence the work we remember him for can be seen as aspiring “to combat the growing chaos of the world” (Southern, “ Benedictine,” 167). We learn from the Institutiones how he had these sub-collections housed, what they included, together with how they were obtained.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates Yonggi Cho 2 ̆ 7 s {{conception}} of Seongnyeong Undong (the Holy Spirit Movement: HSM) in his pastoral ministry {{activity at the}} Yoido Full Gospel Church (YFGC) in Korea. First of all, it examines how Cho 2 ̆ 7 s HSM developed at the YFGC from an historical perspective. Secondly, it discusses Cho 2 ̆ 7 s main theology and investigates this theology from a <b>systematic</b> <b>theological</b> perspective. Thirdly, it focuses on Cho 2 ̆ 7 s belief and practice from a practical, theological perspective. Some scholars say that Cho 2 ̆ 7 s theology, belief and practice, particularly of material blessings and Sinyu (divine healing) in his ministry, {{are similar to those}} in Korean shamanism. However, other scholars argue that his theological ideas came from the Bible and western theological doctrines and Westerners. The present study assesses these different arguments and concludes that Cho tried to base his theological ideas and his ministry activity on biblical foundations rather than on shamanistic and other Korean traditional cultures, even if he used Korean terms to describe them. The study is mainly based on literary research and is divided into five chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the overall focus of the study. Chapter 2 examines the life and ministry of Yonggi Cho, and the development of Yonggi Cho 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of the HSM in his pastoral care since 1958. Using a historical theological method this chapter also shows how Yonggi Cho developed the HSM at the YFGC in his ministry through his written work. Chapter 3 deals with Yonggi Cho 2 ̆ 7 s theological background and his core theology — how he understands the HSM, and the root of HSM from <b>systematic</b> <b>theological</b> perspectives. It shows where his main theology came from on the basis of evidence provided in his numerous writings. Chapter 4 emphasises Yonggi Cho 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of the Holy Spirit (HS) in his belief and practice. It shows where his belief and practice came from, and discusses what his main belief and practices are from practical theological views. Chapter 5 concludes the study. Three main conclusions are drawn with regard to the 1) historical theological, 2) <b>systematic</b> <b>theological,</b> and 3) practical theological perspectives on Yonggi Cho 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of the HS. The thesis concludes that Cho was much more influenced by biblical and western understandings than he was by shamanism or by other Korean traditions, even though he borrowed words from their language...|$|E
40|$|Happiness {{and human}} flourishing has increasingly, {{especially}} in American and German theological writing, become a focus in <b>systematic</b> <b>theological</b> research on creation, salvation and eschatology. The doctrine of salvation has particularly interesting (including etymological) {{connections with the}} notions of well-being and health. This paper proposes to do a critical analysis of well known American happiness theologian Ellen Charry�s portrayal of salvation, who engages with classical theology, Christian doctrine and positive psychology to reposition the notions of �happiness� and �human flourishing� within theological reflection. The art of happiness has, for Charry, to do with knowing, loving and enjoying God. In this article it will be argued that Charry�s portrayal of salvation as being �happy� shapes an understanding of flourishing that entails healing, beauty and pleasure. </p...|$|E

The central aim is to demonstrate, against {{the development of the}} women ministries and the discourse about the ordination of women, that the theological anthropology of the Afrikaans Reformed tradition is deeply influenced by the discursive practices which were established during 1928 to 1932. This article develops a different approach to the women question. At the heart of the discourse is the shift in the reading process. A poststructural feminist discourse is presented and selected guidelines that the church may wish to take into account in the deconstructing of the theological anthropology are suggested.
