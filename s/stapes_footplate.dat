50|$|The stapes bone transmits {{movement}} to the oval window. As the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> moves into the oval window, the round window membrane moves out, and this allows movement of the fluid within the cochlea, leading to movement of the cochlear inner hair cells and thus hearing. If the round window were to be absent or rigidly fixed (as can happen in some congenital abnormalities), the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> would be pushing incompressible fluid against the unyielding walls of the cochlea. It would therefore not move to any useful degree leading to a hearing loss of about 60dB. This is, unsurprisingly, {{the same as for}} conditions where the stapes itself is fixed, such as otosclerosis.|$|E
50|$|If the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> {{is fixed}} in position, {{rather than being}} {{normally}} mobile, then a conductive hearing loss results. There are two major causes of stapes fixation. The first is a disease process of abnormal mineralization {{of the temporal bone}} called otosclerosis. The second is a congenital malformation of the stapes.|$|E
50|$|Physical {{anomalies}} {{caused by}} POU3F4 mutations {{that have been}} recognized by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) include absence of the central axis of the cochlea, an abnormally wide lateral internal auditory canal and a thickened <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate.</b> These anomalies are associated with X-linked non-syndromic deafness.|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} ear, {{the energy of}} {{pressure}} waves is translated into mechanical vibrations by the three auditory ossicles. Pressure waves move the tympanic membrane which in turns moves the malleus, the first bone of the middle ear. The malleus articulates to incus which connects to the <b>stapes.</b> The <b>footplate</b> of the <b>stapes</b> connects to the oval window, {{the beginning of the}} inner ear. When the stapes presses on the oval window, it causes the perilymph, the liquid of the inner ear to move. The middle ear thus serves to convert the energy from sound pressure waves to a force upon the perilymph of the inner ear. The oval window has only approximately 1/18 the area of the tympanic membrane and thus produces a higher pressure. The cochlea propagates these mechanical signals as waves in the fluid and membranes, and then converts them to nerve impulses which are transmitted to the brain.|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} methods to treat otosclerosis. However {{the method of}} choice is a {{procedure}} known as Stapedectomy.Early attempts at hearing restoration via the simple freeing the stapes from its sclerotic attachments to the oval window were met with temporary improvement in hearing, but the conductive hearing loss would almost always recur. A stapedectomy consists of removing {{a portion of the}} sclerotic <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> and replacing it with an implant that is secured to the incus. This procedure restores continuity of ossicular movement and allows transmission of sound waves from the eardrum to the inner ear.A modern variant of this surgery called a stapedotomy, is performed by drilling a small hole in the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> with a micro-drill or a laser, and the insertion of a piston-like prothesis. The success rate of either surgery depends greatly on the skill and the familiarity with the procedure of the surgeon. However, comparisons have shown stapedotomy to yield results at least as good as stapedectomy, with fewer complications, and thus stapedotomy is preferred under normal circumstances.|$|E
50|$|CHL in {{otosclerosis}} {{is caused}} by two main sites of involvement of the sclerotic (or scar-like) lesions. The best understood mechanism is fixation of the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> to the oval window of the cochlea. This greatly impairs movement of the stapes and therefore transmission of sound into the inner ear (“ossicular coupling”). Additionally the cochlea’s round window can also become sclerotic, and {{in a similar way}} impair movement of sound pressure waves through the inner ear (“acoustic coupling”).|$|E
50|$|Conductive {{hearing loss}} is usually concommitant with impingementof {{abnormal}} bone on the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate.</b> This involvementof the oval window {{forms the basis}} of the name fenestralotosclerosis. The most common location of involvement ofotosclerosis is the bone just anterior to the oval window at asmall cleft known as the fissula ante fenestram. The fissula isa thin fold of connective tissue extending through the endochondrallayer, approximately between the oval window and the cochleariform process, where the tensor tympani tendonturns laterally toward the malleus.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the base}} of the cochlea, each duct ends in a {{membranous}} portal that faces the middle ear cavity: The vestibular duct ends at the oval window, where the <b>footplate</b> of the <b>stapes</b> sits. The <b>footplate</b> vibrates when the pressure is transmitted via the ossicular chain. [...] The wave in the perilymph moves away from the footplate and towards the helicotrema. Since those fluid waves move the cochlear partition that separates the ducts up and down, the waves have a corresponding symmetric part in perilymph of the tympanic duct, which ends at the round window, bulging out when the oval window bulges in.|$|R

40|$|SummaryIntroductionHigh-resolution CT imaging is {{essential}} to diagnosis and follow-up of temporal bone pathology. Morphologically, CT is the reference examination. The requirement of long-term follow-up thus exposes patients to cumulative radiation doses. Limiting exposure to ionizing radiation is an increasing concern of public health authorities. The principal advantage of Cone Beam CT (CBCT) lies in {{a significant reduction in}} radiation dose. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to assess the morphologic concordance between CBCT and Multislice Helical Computed Tomography (MSCT) on 20 anatomic landmarks corresponding to regions of interest in clinical practice. The secondary objectives were to compare the two techniques qualitatively in <b>stapes</b> and <b>footplate</b> assessment and measurement of footplate thickness, and quantitatively in terms of dosimetry. Material and methodsAn experimental anatomical study was performed on 12 temporal bones from fresh human cadavers of unknown clinical history. Each underwent CBCT and MSCT. ResultsThere was no significant difference in morphologic assessment of the temporal bones on the two techniques. Exploration of the stapes, incudostapedial joint, anterior stapediovestibular joint and footplate was qualitatively more precise on CBCT, and footplate thickness showed less overestimation than on MSCT. CBCT delivered 22 times less radiation than MSCT under the present experimental conditions. ConclusionCBCT provides reliable morphologic assessment of temporal bone, thanks to higher spatial resolution than on MSCT, with significantly reduced radiation dose...|$|R
50|$|A {{modified}} stapes operation, {{called a}} stapedotomy, is thought by many otologic surgeons to be safer {{and reduce the}} chances of postoperative complications. In stapedotomy, instead of removing the whole <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate,</b> a tiny hole {{is made in the}} footplate - either with a microdrill or with a laser, and a prosthesis is placed to touch this area with movement of the tympanic membrane. This procedure can be further improved by the use of a tissue graft seal of the fenestra, which is now common practice.|$|E
50|$|When a {{stapedectomy}} {{is done in}} {{a middle}} ear with a congenitally fixed footplate, the results may be excellent but the risk of hearing damage is greater than when the stapes bone is removed and replaced (for otosclerosis). This is primarily due {{to the risk of}} additional anomalies being present in the congenitally abnormal ear. If high pressure within the fluid compartment that lies just below the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> exists, then a perilymphatic gusher may occur when the stapes is removed. Even without immediate complications during surgery, there is always concern of a perilymph fistula forming postoperatively.|$|E
50|$|The world's first {{stapedectomy}} {{is credited}} to Dr. John J.Shea Jr. who performed it in May 1956 on a 54-year-old housewife who {{could no longer}} hear even with a hearing aid.

50|$|NIHL {{occurs when}} too much sound {{intensity}} is transmitted into {{and through the}} auditory system. An acoustic signal from a sound source, such as a radio, enters into the external auditory canal, and is funneled through to the tympanic membrane (eardrum). The tympanic membrane acts as an elastic diaphragm driving the ossicular chain {{of the middle ear}} system into motion. The middle ear ossicles transfer mechanical energy to the cochlea by way of the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> hammering against the oval window of the cochlea. This hammering causes the fluid within the cochlea (perilymph and endolymph) to push against the stereocilia of the hair cells, which then transmit a signal to the central auditory system within the brain. Different groups of hair cells are responsive to and conductive of different frequencies. There are two known biological mechanisms of NIHL from excessive sound intensity: damage to the hair cells and damage to the myelination or synaptic regions of auditory nerves.|$|E
50|$|Air {{pressure}} {{changes in}} the ear canal cause the vibrations of the tympanic membrane and middle ear ossicles. At {{the end of the}} ossicular chain, movement of the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> within the oval window of the cochlea, in turn, generates a pressure field within the cochlear fluids, imparting a pressure differential across the basilar membrane. A sinusoidal pressure wave results in localized vibrations of the organ of Corti: near the base for high frequencies, near the apex for low frequencies. The cochlea thus acts as an 'acoustic prism', distributing the energy of each Fourier component of a complex sound at different locations along its longitudinal axis. Hair cells in the cochlea are stimulated when the basilar membrane is driven up and down by differences in the fluid pressure between the scala vestibuli and scala tympani. Because this motion is accompanied by a shearing motion between the tectorial membrane and the reticular lamina of the organ of Corti, the hair bundles that link the two are deflected, which initiates mechano-electrical transduction. When the basilar membrane is driven upward, shear between the hair cells and the tectorial membrane deflects hair bundles in the excitatory direction, toward their tall edge. At the midpoint of an oscillation the hair bundles resume their resting position. When the basilar membrane moves downward, the hair bundles are driven in the inhibitory direction.|$|E
50|$|The {{ossicles}} are classically {{supposed to}} mechanically convert the vibrations of the eardrum, into amplified pressure {{waves in the}} fluid of the cochlea (or inner ear) with a lever arm factor of 1.3. Since the effective vibratory area of the eardrum is about 14 fold larger {{than that of the}} oval window, the sound pressure is concentrated, leading to a pressure gain of at least 18.1. The eardrum is merged to the malleus, which connects to the incus, which in turn connects to the stapes. Vibrations of the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> introduce pressure waves in the inner ear. There is a steadily increasing body of evidence that shows that the lever arm ratio is actually variable, depending on frequency. Between 0.1 and 1 kHz it is approximately 2, it then rises to around 5 at 2 kHz and then falls off steadily above this frequency. The measurement of this lever arm ratio is also somewhat {{complicated by the fact that}} the ratio is generally given in relation to the tip of the malleus (also known as the umbo) and the level of the middle of the stapes. The eardrum is actually attached to the malleus handle over about a 0.5 cm distance. In addition the eardrum itself moves in a very chaotic fashion at frequencies >3 kHz. The linear attachment of the eardrum to the malleus actually smooths out this chaotic motion and allows the ear to respond linearly over a wider frequency range than a point attachment. The auditory ossicles can also reduce sound pressure (the inner ear is very sensitive to overstimulation), by uncoupling each other through particular muscles.|$|E

Five of the 10 temporal bones were implanted with 3 types of TORPs before subjecting them to micro-computed tomography. The angles between tympanic membrane and <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> were determined. The contact of the TORPs to these structures was assessed. Results: The angle between the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> and the tympanic membrane was, on average, 25. 9 degrees in a plane along the transverse axis of the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> and 24. 6 degrees in a plane along the longitudinal axis of the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate.</b> Consideration of these angles in TORPs resulted in an optimal contact with the tympanic membrane and <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate,</b> especially for prostheses with a large foot.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether stapes movement is pistonlike or complex. BACKGROUND: The literature provides conflicting information on whether <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> motion is only pistonlike or has other types of movement, such as hingelike or rocking. METHODS: Using 10 freshly harvested human cadaver temporal bones, 3 targets were placed on the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> through an extended facial recess approach. The targets were 0. 5 -mm pieces of reflective adhesive material positioned on the long axis of the footplate at the anterior crus, central footplate, and posterior crus. Displacement and phase of the three targets were measured from 0. 2 to 10 kHz at a 90 dB sound pressure level input at the tympanic membrane. The measuring system was a sophisticated laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). A computer program (Tymptest) calculated footplate displacement and relative phase at the three sites and the ratio of anterior-posterior rocking movement of the footplate long axis to displacement at the center. RESULTS: Below 2. 0 kHz, stapes vibration is predominately pistonlike. Above 2. 0 kHz, anterior-posterior rocking motion increases logarithmically with frequency, and, near 4. 0 kHz, rocking and pistonlike motion are approximately equal. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> vibration is primarily pistonlike up to 2. 0 kHz but becomes more complex at higher frequencies because of an increase in anterior-posterior rocking motion. Hingelike movements were not observed. This information may be helpful in the design of ossicular replacement prostheses that mimic or improve upon normal stapes vibration...|$|E

40|$|Background: Some {{patients}} with chronic middle ear disease and multiple failed revisions, who also need a hearing aid, may benefit from an active middle ear implant. An advantage of an active middle ear implant is that the ear canal is unoccluded. Methods: Following extensive experimental development in temporal bones and investigations of various locations and attachments of a Vibrant Soundbridge transducer, a new titanium clip holder for the vibrant floating mass transducer was developed. This assembly is a total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) that {{is placed on the}} <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate.</b> Six patients were implanted with this device. Results: Acoustic results demonstrate significantly improved gain, especially in the high frequencies, which is typically unobtainable by conventional hearing aids.

40|$|The {{success of}} middle ear {{reconstructive}} surgery depends on stable coupling between the prosthesis and residual ossicles. To establish a stable fixed {{point on the}} <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> for subsequent prosthesis reconstruction, a titanium footplate anchor was coated with osteoinductive substances to induce a controlled osseointegration on the footplate. Various {{studies have shown that}} collagen-based matrices with and without bone growth and differentiation factors can induce and enhance bone formation and consequently increase implant stability. The ears of 23 one-year-old Merino sheep (n = 46) were divided into five groups and implanted with a specially designed footplate anchor. The surface of each implant was modified by applying a collagenous matrix (collagen I or II) either with immobilized bone morphogenic protein (BMP- 4) or transforming growth factor-ss, respectively, to stimulate osteoblastic activation and differentiation on the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> with subsequent osseointegration. Polychrome labeling was used to assess new bone formation and remodeling during the study.

Clinically, gentamicin has been used extensively to treat the debilitating symptoms of Meniere's disease and {{is well known for}} its vestibulotoxic properties. Until recently, it was widely accepted that the round window membrane (RWM) was the primary entry route into the inner ear following intratympanic drug administration. In the current study, gentamicin was delivered to either the RWM or the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> of guinea pigs (GPs) to assess the associated hearing loss and histopathology associated with each procedure. Vestibulotoxicity of the utricular macula, saccular macula, and crista ampullaris in the posterior semicircular canal were assessed quantitatively with density counts of hair cells, supporting cells, and stereocilia in histological sections.

Animals receiving gentamicin applied to the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> exhibited markedly higher levels of hearing loss between 8 and 32 kHz, a greater reduction of outer hair cells in the basal turn of the cochlea and fewer normal type I cells in the utricle in the vestibule than those receiving gentamicin on the RWM or saline controls.

Stapes motions were measured with acoustic stimuli as well as mechanical stimuli using a custom-made three-axis piezoelectric actuator, and errors in the motion components were analyzed. The ratio of error in each motion component was reduced by increasing the magnitude of the stimuli, but the improvement was limited when the motion component was small relative to other components.

40|$|Objectives : In Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) a {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} may arise during childhood or young adulthood, which is usually due to an otosclerosis-like pathology involving <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> fixation whether or not in combination with atrophic or fractured crura. Usually the hearing loss evolves to a mixed hearing loss over time. The benefits of stapes surgery, partially or totally replacing the stapes by a prosthesis, have been a controversial matter in the OI population because of the progressive course of the sensorineural component. We present the short- and long-term postoperative audiometric results in {{a new series of}} stapes surgery in OI and compare them with the results from other series in literature. Methods : Surgery reports and preoperative, short-term postoperative and long-term (≥ 12 months) postoperative audiometric results from 34 operated ears originating from 22 Dutch and Belgian OI patients operated at different institutes were obtained retrospectively. A primary stapes operation was performed in 29 ears, and from 5 other ears we obtained the results of revision stapes surgery. Results : At surgery all ears demonstrated fixation of the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> in the oval window, impeding the normal transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. Additionally, footplates were mentioned thickened or fragile, stapes crura atrophic or fractured, and the middle ear mucosa thickened or hypervascularized. The post-operative audiometric follow-up period ranged from 1 month to 37 years. Postoperative audiometry in the short-term revealed improved hearing and reduced air-bone gaps in 28 out of 29 ears with primary stapes surgery and in all ears with revision surgery after a second revision operation was performed in one ear. In all the 22 ears with long-term postoperative follow-up, which had an average duration of 15 years, a hearing gain was still measurable at the latest audiometric evaluation. Conclusions : Beneficial results are obtained in the majority of OI patients undergoing stapes surgery for the reduction of a {{conductive hearing loss}} component caused by <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> fixation. Despite the progressive course of the concomitant sensorineural hearing loss component, the hearing gain remains beneficial over the years...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Most implantable {{hearing aids}} {{currently}} available {{were developed to}} compensate the sensorineural hearing loss by driving middle ear structures (e. g., the ossicles). These devices are successfully used in round window (RW) stimulation clinically, although this was initially not the intended use. Here, a novel microactuator, specifically designed for RW stimulation, was tested in human temporal bones to determine actuator performance and applicability. Methods. <b>Stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> response to RW stimulation was determined experimentally in human temporal bones and the obtained sound pressure output level was estimated. Results. The actuator had a flat displacement response between 0. 125 and 4 [*]kHz, a resonance between 4 and 7 [*]kHz, and a roll-off above. At increasing contact force, the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> displacement decreased by 5 – 10 [*]dB re μm for forces ≥ 2 [*]mN. The equivalent sound pressure level between 0. 125 and 4 [*]kHz amounted to 87 – 97 [*]eq[*]dB SPL and increased to 117 [*]eq[*]dB SPL for frequencies of 4 – 7 [*]kHz. The total harmonic distortion (THD) of the actuator ranged within 15 – 40 % for static forces of 5 [*]mN. Conclusion. The feasibility of an electromagnetic actuator that may be placed into the RW niche was demonstrated but requires further optimization in terms of THD and static force sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Hearing {{threshold}} {{data with}} bone conduction and air conduction stimulation are combined with physiological and mechanical {{measurements of the}} middle ear ossicles vibration to compute the vibration level of the ossicles at threshold stimulation. By comparing the displacements of the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> with the two stimulation modalities and assuming the vibration of the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> to be the input to the cochlea when stimulation is by air conduction, the importance of middle ear ossicles inertia with bone conduction stimulation is evaluated. Given the limitations of the analysis, the results indicate that the inertia {{of the middle ear}} is not an important contribution to the perception of BC sound for frequencies below 1. 5 kHz; it seems to contribute to perception of bone conducted sound between the frequencies 1. 5 and 3. 5 kHz. At frequencies above 4 kHz, the analysis failed since the input to the cochlea is probably not through the oval window with bone conduction stimulation. Comparison of basilar membrane vibration data verified the calculations for frequencies between 0. 8 and 3. 5 kHz. It was also found that the fluid flow at the round window, rather than at the oval window, reflects the stimulation of the basilar membrane with bone conduction stimulation...|$|E

RESULTS: Overall, we observed a mean gain in air conduction pure tone average of 17 dB (from 47 dB to 30 dB), a sensorineural deterioration of 3 dB, and a mean postoperative air-bone gap of 19 dB (mean preoperative air-bone gap of 38 dB). The air-bone gap closure was 20 dB or less in 15 of the 23 cases (65 %), in agreement with the few results reported in the literature. Moreover, the audiometric results remained stable. In the syndromic group, the mean gain in air conduction was only 13 dB, which was worse than that observed for the nonsyndromic ears. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for congenital ossicular chain anomalies with a concomitant mobile <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> provides positive audiometric outcomes. Most ears had some sensorineural impairment (10 to 20 dB), which influenced the final hearing level attained after surgery. Preoperative assessment is mandatory to search for syndromal diagnoses, which might be important for patient counseling and prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{describe}} an experimental method {{for measuring the}} acoustic transmission matrix of the middle-ear using otoacoustic emissions. The experiment builds on previous work that uses distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) as an intracochlear sound source to drive the middle-ear in reverse. This technique eliminates the complications introduced by needing to place an acoustic transducer inside the cochlea. Previous authors have shown how the complete 4 x 3 system response matrix, with its 12 unknowns, can be simplified to a 2 x 2 transmission matrix by de-coupling the middle-ear cavity and assuming the cochlear fluids are incompressible. This simplified description of middle-ear mechanics assumes that the input-output response at the tympanic membrane and <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> is linear, one dimensional and time invariant. The technique allows for estimating the acoustic pressure and volume velocity at the tympanic membrane and the volume velocity of the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate,</b> in both the forward and reverse direction, and under different boundary conditions at the stapes. The technique was applied to deeply anesthetized cats with widely opened middle-ear cavities over a frequency range of 200 Hz to 10 kHz. Results on three animals are reported and generally agree with previous data and a published middle-ear model. by Antonio John Miller. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{middle ear}} as a levered {{vibrating}} system for sound transmission from the {{external to the}} inner ear is affected by changes in ossicular chain mass. Mass loading of the ossicles may impair ossicular dynamics and sound transmission to the inner ear. It is incumbent on otologic surgeons and researchers of middle ear mechanics to consider the mass loading effect on middle ear function in clinical and physiological applications. The residual hearing and frequency response can change after surgery or implantation of middle ear prostheses. We conducted experiments on mass loading effects on the middle ear transfer functions by using laser Doppler interferometry and a human temporal bone model. Two implant mass loading conditions were tested on 17 fresh or fresh-frozen temporal bones and compared with the unloaded condition for the frequencies 250 to 8, 000 Hz. The {{results show that the}} linearity of the middle ear function did not change, although displacement of the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate</b> decreased after the increased masses were placed on the incudostapedial joint. The greater the mass of the implant, the less displacement was measured at the <b>stapes</b> <b>footplate.</b> We conclude that there is a quantitative limit to increased mass on the ossicular chain above which the mass will remarkably impair hearing thresholds.
