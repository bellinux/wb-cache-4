5000|$|Because {{lightning}} strikes are extremely hot, when lightning channels reach the ground, they can fuse siliceous, carbonaceous, and calcareous components of soil to create glassy, tube-like, crust-like, or slag-like objects known as fulgurite (fulgar in Latin means [...] "lightning"). [...] Just as {{lightning strikes}} can branch in various directions - or produce knot-like balled forms - fulgurite forms dendritic or beaded configurations, often following the characteristic shape of plant roots or other organic-filled cavities in the ground. [...] Fulgurite {{is important in}} the study of paleoclimate because they are an artifact of past lightning storms. [...] Since fulgurite is of a glass-like structure, those of tube morphology are brittle, and samples can vary in length and thickness, often {{as a result of their}} depositional environment. [...] For example, fulgurite found in the Saharan Desert was much smaller than fulgurite found near the Elbe River in Germany (20 centimeters versus several meters, respectively). [...] Most fulgurite is found in remnants of paleolakes and along slopes between depressions in dunes. [...] It has been suggested that these locations are prime for lightning activity because characteristically larger electric fields would have been present in these areas, which would enable positive leaders to stream vertically to meet the downward-propagating <b>stepped</b> <b>leader</b> more easily than other locations. As such, brittle, tube-like, branching fulgurites are assumed to be associated with downward-propagating negative discharges. [...] Fulgurites are often examined under polarized light for the purposes of distinguishing these fragments from other quartz sand structures. [...] An important distinction for fulgurite is the presence of Lechatelierite. [...] Lechatelierite is an isotropic substance, so when this mineral is exposed to polarized light, the direction through which the light passes through Lechatelierite does not change; thus it is easily identifiable compared to other grains. [...] Lechatelierite is a brittle substance, so eolian and depositional influences can impact the concentrations of Lechatelierite in fulgurite samples. [...] However, varying concentrations and distributions allow for the analysis of climatic features of a region.|$|E
40|$|The <b>stepped</b> <b>leader</b> {{forms the}} first phase of the first stroke in any {{lightning}} flash. It is basically a stepwise elongating discharge in air, which carries significant charge. The charge distribution on the leader and its velocity of descent, determine the attractive radius in shielding efficiency calculations. Also, the conductivity and the charge distribution on the leader tip region govern the initial stages of the return stroke. Therefore, there is a need for determining these parameters accurately. In this regard, a self-consistent model for the <b>stepped</b> <b>leader</b> will be very useful.

However, the negative <b>stepped</b> <b>leader</b> phase in triggered flashes is of shorter duration (tens of milliseconds), than that in intracloud flashes (usually hundreds of milliseconds).

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis is presented of the electric-field variations preceding the first return strokes of 80 cloud-to-ground lightning flashes in nine different storms observed at the NASA Kennedy Space Center during the summers of 1976 and 1977. It {{is suggested that}} the electric-field variations can best be characterized as having two sections: preliminary variations and <b>stepped</b> <b>leader.</b> The stepped-leader change begins during a transition period of a few milliseconds marked by characteristic bipolar pulses; the duration of stepped leaders lies most frequently in the 6 - 20 millisecond range.

30|$|A {{randomly}} <b>stepped</b> <b>leader</b> {{propagation model}} is developed to study gigantic jets, {{a new type}} of lightning, connecting thunderclouds to the ionosphere. The thundercloud is considered as one electrode igniting gigantic jets and the ionosphere is assumed as the other. The propagation of <b>stepped</b> <b>leader</b> is considered as a field controlled random growth process. The electric field is produced due to the thundercloud charges and the self-consistently propagating leader. A leader propagation probability is proposed to determine whether the leader grows at the next step and what the step direction of the leader is in case of growth. The results show that leader propagation spans ~ 72 km from igniting position to the ionosphere. The simulation of leader propagation appears to be in agreement with the structure of observed gigantic jets.|$|E

40|$|The {{answer to}} the {{question}} “Does lightning between cloud and ground go upwards or downwards? ” is that, in a sense, it does both. The usual lightning flash between cloud and ground (excluding the discharges initiated by tall structures discussed in Chapter 6) begins with a visually-undetected downward-mov-ing traveling spark called the <b>stepped</b> <b>leader</b> (see Chapters 2 and 6). Since the lightning flash begins with a downward-moving discharge, lightning moves from the cloud to the ground. On the other hand, when the <b>stepped</b> <b>leader</b> reaches ground (or is contacted by an upward-moving discharge some tens of yards above the ground) the leader channel first becomes highly lumi-nous at the ground and then at higher and higher altitudes. The bright, visible channel, or so-called return stroke, is formed from the ground up, and one could say, therefore, that visible light-ning moves from the ground to the cloud...|$|E

The fields were recorded under conditions where the lightning locations were known {{and where the}} field propagation from the lightning sources to the recording site was entirely over salt water. The spectra for return strokes show an f exp - 1 frequency dependence from 100 kHz to 2 MHz, an f exp - 2 dependence between 2 and 10 MHz, and an f exp - 5 decrease above 10 MHz. In the 1 to 20 MHz range, the spectra of the initial fast transition in return strokes, the initial fast-rising portion of <b>leader</b> <b>steps</b> and the fast transitions in positive intracloud pulses are surprisingly similar...|$|R

The majority of leader pulses {{are characterized by}} a large initial peak with a small and slow opposite overshoot.

40|$|A {{physical}} model {{based on the}} mechanism observed in experimental investigations is introduced to describe the formation of negative leader steps. Starting with a small length of a space leader located at {{the periphery of the}} negative streamer system of the <b>stepped</b> <b>leader,</b> the model simulates the growth and the subsequent formation of the leader step. Based on the model, the step length, the step forming time, and the propagation speed of stepped leaders {{as a function of the}} prospective return stroke peak current are estimated.

The results also show that the speed of the <b>stepped</b> <b>leader</b> increases as it approaches the ground. For prospective return stroke currents in the range of 15 kA– 60 kA, the step lengths lie within the range 5 m– 100 m, the step forming times lie within the range 10 μs– 250 μs, and the leader speed lies within the range 105 m/s − 1. 5 × 106 m/s.

40|$|Forecasting the {{striking}} {{point of a}} lightning flash {{is important for the}} reduction of lightning hazards. Field campaigns have been conducted, and the features of leader progression have been investigated for this final goal. Both streak and still camera observations are used, because we can obtain useful information on the leader progression manner and its velocity. A radio interferometer is another useful instrument, by which, we can capture a lightning channel image from its initiation inside the thundercloud to the attachment process to the ground. Though many laborious investigations have been performed and various results have been presented, the exact forecasting of a striking point still remains difficult. To overcome this, numerical simulations of a <b>stepped</b> <b>leader</b> near the ground surface have been carried out using the leader progression model, which has been improved by using the fractal mathematical concept. In other words, the proposed scheme in this paper is a probabilistic procedure. The finite-difference approach is applied to the two-dimensional Poisson's equation to calculate the electric field produced by the charge distribution in a thundercloud. The stepped leaders, which are initiated at {{the lower part of the}} cloud and usually proceed towards the ground, are simulated to study the theoretical <b>stepped</b> <b>leader</b> progression.
