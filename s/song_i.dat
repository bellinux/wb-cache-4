5|$|The British {{propaganda}} {{radio station}} Soldatensender Calais (Soldiers' Radio Calais) {{was used to}} conspicuously broadcast to the Germans that they knew about a planned intruder operation. The station did so by playing the contemporary <b>song</b> <b>I</b> dance with Gisela tonight. The operation was suspended repeatedly until the British relaxed vigilance.|$|E
5|$|What {{grabbed me}} at first {{actually}} {{was the fact}} it was so big. The melody starts off very soft but then it gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the <b>song</b> <b>I</b> put myself in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E
5|$|I {{remember}} {{being in the}} back part of the studio, and we were sitting there {{late at night and}} writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and we came up with the basis for the <b>song.</b> <b>I</b> put a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E

5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate <b>song.</b> <b>I</b> had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To me it felt like a painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E
5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} <b>song</b> <b>I</b> say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E
