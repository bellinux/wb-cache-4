40|$|SOX {{genes are}} found {{throughout}} the animal kingdom and encode a highly conserved family of transcription factors involved {{in a wide range}} of developmental processes (for review, see Wegner, 1999). SOX proteins bind DNA in a sequence-dependent manner via the HMG box domain, and many have been shown to have separable domains associated with transcriptional regulation. Several SOX genes have been implicated in inherited human disorders: SRY in male-to-female sex reversal and gonadal dysgenesis (Berta et al. 1990; Ja ̈ger et al. 1990), <b>SOX</b> 9 <b>in</b> the skeletal dys-morphogenesis syndrome campomelic dysplasia (Foster and Graves 1994; Wagner et al. 1994), and <b>SOX</b> 10 <b>in</b> the neurochristopathy Waardenburg Shah syndrome- 4 (Pingault et al. 1998). Furthermore, targeted disruption in mice has demonstrated vital roles for <b>Sox</b> 4 <b>in</b> cardiac development (Schilham et al. 1996), <b>Sox</b> 9 <b>in</b> chondrogenesis (Bi et al. 1999), and <b>Sox</b> 1 <b>in</b> lens development (Nishiguchi et al. 1998) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the associa-tion between the expression of sex-determining region Y box 2 (<b>SOX</b> 2) <b>in</b> retinoblastoma (Rb) tissues and peripheral blood, and the clinicopathological characteristics of Rb. The expression of <b>SOX</b> 2 <b>in</b> Rb tissues was detected by immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis. <b>SOX</b> 2 expression <b>in</b> the peripheral blood of children with Rb was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The correla-tion between SOX 2 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of Rb was analyzed using χ 2 tests. The positive rate of <b>SOX</b> 2 <b>in</b> Rb tissues was 82. 2 %, while the expression of <b>SOX</b> 2 <b>in</b> the control group tissues was negative. Western blot analysis detected a higher expression of <b>SOX</b> 2 <b>in</b> the Rb tissues than {{in the control group}} tissues. Poorly differentiated Rb tissues exhibited significantly higher levels of SOX 2 expression compared with the well-differentiated Rb tissues. SOX 2 expres-sion was higher in the peripheral blood of children with Rb than in individuals from the control group. The level of <b>SOX</b> 2 expression <b>in</b> the peripheral blood of the poorly differentiated group was higher than that of the well-differentiated group. Enhanced <b>SOX</b> 2 expression <b>in</b> Rb tissues and peripheral blood was closely associated with the clinicopathological characteris-tics of Rb. Therefore, SOX 2 may be a novel target biomarker for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of Rb...|$|R

40|$|The Sox genes {{define a}} family of {{transcription}} factors that {{play a key role}} in the determination of cell fate during development. The preferential expression of the <b>Sox</b> 15 <b>in</b> the myogenic precursor cells led us to suggest that the Sox 15 is involved in the specification of myogenic cell lineages or in the regulation of the fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes during the development and regeneration of skeletal muscle. To identify the physiological function of <b>Sox</b> 15 <b>in</b> mice, we disrupted the Sox 15 by homologous recombination <b>in</b> mice. <b>Sox</b> 15 -deficient mice were born at expected ratios, were healthy and fertile, and displayed normal long-term survival rates. Histological analysis revealed the normal ultrastructure of myofibers and the presence of comparable amounts of satellite cells in the skeletal muscles of Sox 15 −/− animals compared to wild-type animals. These results exclude the role of <b>Sox</b> 15 <b>in</b> the development of satellite cells. However, cultured Sox 15 −/− myoblasts displayed a marked delay in differentiation potential in vitro. Moreover, skeletal muscle regeneration <b>in</b> <b>Sox</b> 15 −/− mice was attenuated after application of a crush injury. These results suggest a requirement for <b>Sox</b> 15 <b>in</b> the myogenic program. Expression analyses of the early myogenic regulated factors MyoD and Myf 5 showed the downregulation of the MyoD and upregulation of the Myf 5 <b>in</b> <b>Sox</b> 15 −/− myoblasts. These results show an increased proportion of the Myf 5 -positive cells and suggest a role for <b>Sox</b> 15 <b>in</b> determining the early myogenic cell lineages during skeletal muscle development...|$|R

40|$|Anophthalmia (no eye), {{microphthalmia}} (small eye) {{and associated}} ocular developmental anomalies cause significant visual handicap. In {{most cases the}} underlying genetic cause is unknown, but mutations in some genes, such as SOX 2, cause ocular developmental defects, particularly anophthalmia, in a subset of patients. Here, we describe a four-generation family with a p. Asp 123 Gly mutation in the highly conserved partner-factor interaction region of the SOX 2 protein, which is important for cell-specific actions of SOX 2. The proband in this family has bilateral anophthalmia and several other family members have milder ocular phenotypes, including typical optic fissure coloboma. Expression studies indicate that Sox 2 is expressed in the eye {{at the site of}} closure of the optic fissure during development. The <b>SOX</b> 2 mutation <b>in</b> this family implicates the partner-factor interaction region of <b>SOX</b> 2 <b>in</b> contributing to the specificity of <b>SOX</b> 2 action <b>in</b> optic fissure closure. Our findings indicate that investigation of <b>SOX</b> 2 <b>in</b> a broad range of eye anomaly patients aids in the determination of particular functions of <b>SOX</b> 2 <b>in</b> development...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Seizures {{are noted}} in a {{significant}} proportion of cases of de novo, heterozygous, loss-of-function mutations <b>in</b> <b>SOX</b> 2, ascertained because of severe bilateral eye malformations. We wished to determine the underlying cerebral phenotype <b>in</b> <b>SOX</b> 2 mutation and to test the candidacy of SOX 2 as a gene contributing to human epilepsies. METHODS: We examined high-resolution MRI scans in four patients with SOX 2 mutations, two of whom had seizures. We determined the Sox 2 expression pattern in developing murine brain. We searched for <b>SOX</b> 2 mutation <b>in</b> 24 patients with typical hippocampal sclerosis and for common variations <b>in</b> <b>SOX</b> 2 <b>in</b> 655 patients without eye disease but with epilepsy, including 91 patients with febrile seizures, 93 with hippocampal sclerosis, and 258 with temporal lobe epilepsy. RESULTS: Striking hippocampal and parahippocampal malformations were seen in all cases, with a history of febrile seizures or epilepsy in two of four cases. The Sox 2 expression pattern in developing mouse brain supports the pattern of malformations observed. Mutation screening in patients with epilepsy did not reveal any abnormalities <b>in</b> <b>SOX</b> 2. No associations were found between any clinical epilepsy phenotype and common variation <b>in</b> <b>SOX</b> 2. CONCLUSIONS: SOX 2 haploinsufficiency causes mesial temporal malformation <b>in</b> humans, making <b>SOX</b> 2 dysfunction a candidate mechanism for mesial temporal abnormalities associated with chronic epilepsy. However, although mutation of <b>SOX</b> 2 <b>in</b> humans causes hippocampal malformation, SOX 2 mutation or variation is unlikely to contribute commonly to mesial temporal lobe epilepsy or its structural (hippocampal sclerosis) or historic (febrile seizures) associations in humans...|$|R

5|$|One {{criticism}} of the practice holds that the manager has enough to be preoccupied with during a game without playing.
