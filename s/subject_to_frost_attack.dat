40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the results from the}} precision evaluation of the modified slab test for resistance of concrete <b>to</b> internal <b>frost</b> damage. Two round Robin tests, one at the Nordic level and another at the RILEM level, were carried out in the project. Three non-destructive detecting techniques, Ultrasonic Pulse Transmission Time (UPTT), Dilation (length change) and Fundamental Frequency (FF), were evaluated through the round Robin tests. A destructive method (flexural strength test) was employed to examine the deterioration of concrete in mechanical properties due <b>to</b> internal <b>frost</b> damage. The results show that all the three techniques can be employed in the slab test for detecting internal damage of concrete <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> <b>attack.</b> The dilation method reveals a better repeatability, but has a reproducibility similar to the UPTT technique. The temperature effect on test precision seems not significant. Therefore, the same frost test procedure as described in the Swedish standard SS 72 13 44 can be used in the modified slab test. Due to {{a very small number of}} laboratories participated in the FF test the precision estimate for this technique involves a large uncertainty. Since the FF test reveals promising sensitivity to detecting internal damage, further collaboration study is needed for evaluating the precision of this technique. Pris: 150 SEK.

5000|$|Massonia {{species have}} been {{described}} as [...] "essentially plants for the collector".

50|$|Beschorneria is a genus of {{succulent}} plants {{belonging to}} the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Agavoideae, native to semi-arid areas of Mexico and Central America. They are generally large evergreen perennials forming clumps of grey-green leaves, with tall flower-spikes to 1.5 m. Marginally hardy, they may require winter protection in areas <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>frost.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Eleusine indica {{performs}} C4 photosynthesis {{and therefore}} can grow in hot climates and in the hotter months of the temperate zone. Its seeds germinate later in spring than most other temperate zone weeds, such as crabgrasses.

50|$|Mineral soil seedbeds {{are more}} {{receptive}} than the undisturbed forest floor, and are generally moister and more readily rewetted than the organic forest floor. However, exposed mineral soil, {{much more so}} than organic-surfaced soil, is <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> heaving and shrinkage during drought. The forces generated in soil by frost or drought are quite enough to break roots.|$|R
50|$|Occurring on dry, fertile sites, the {{vegetation}} structure is usually open with heights of 15 to 41 metres. Soil is usually dolerite and flats are <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> and cold air-drainage. The shrub layer is sparse and a dense, species rich ground layer of grasses and herbs is present. Typical species include tussock grass, kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra), wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia sp.) and sagg (Lomandra longifolia).|$|R
50|$|Magnolia denudata is {{a rather}} low, rounded, thickly branched, and coarse-textured tree to 30 ft tall. The leaves are ovate, bright green, 15 cm long and 8 cm wide.

50|$|Although those {{landslides}} {{must have}} been a great curse to whoever lived at this farm at the time, they may have been something of a blessing in disguise for Hellnahellir. This is because the landslides have put a several-metres-thick layer of earth on top of the cave essentially putting it farther into the ground than it originally was. The layer of earth contributes to a better preservation of the cave as a form of insulation that makes the temperature inside it more even and the cave less likely <b>to</b> be <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> and water damages.|$|R

[...] All of these roads are sealed but <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> and occasionally snow or at other times to flooding, and to the hazard of hitting a kangaroo particularly at or after dusk.

30|$|Ice forming {{activity}} {{occurs in}} various lifeforms including some bacteria, pollen and fungal spores. Such activity {{is associated with}} specific molecules. In some case ice nucleation activity may benefit the organism. For example, the pathogenic rust Puccinia lagenophorae possesses ice nucleation sites on its aeciospores {{and it has been}} shown that leaves artificially infected with this fungus and <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> suffer greater penetration of ice crystals into the plants’ tissues, presumably improving access for the fungus (Paul and Ayres 1991). But sometimes such activity may be an incidental by-product of other selective processes. For example, cellulose promotes ice formation below – 21  °C (Hiranuma et al. 2015).|$|R
50|$|The rhubarb plants {{spend two}} years {{out in the}} fields without being harvested. While in the fields the plants store energy from the sun in their roots as carbohydrates.

In the sheds the plants begin {{to grow in the}} warmth and the stored carbohydrate in the roots is transformed into glucose resulting in forced rhubarb's sour-sweet flavour. The sheds are long low buildings which are heated; originally with coal, which was plentiful and relatively cheap in the area but has been replaced by diesel.|$|R

5000|$|The pre-Columbian Andean civilizations, {{of which}} the Inca Empire was the last, faced severe {{challenges}} in feeding {{the millions of people}} who were their subjects.

Tropical crops could not be grown in the short growing seasons and a staple crop, maize, could not usually be grown above 3200 m in elevation. The people at higher elevations grew potatoes, quinoa and a few other root and pseudocereal crops. Herding llamas and alpacas for meat, wool, and as beasts of burden was important.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Bricks of {{tunnels and}} bridges of Usui Pass railway (Japan) exposed <b>to</b> north are <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> damage. Average depth of erosion due to {{detachment}} of angular blocks is around 1 – 1. 5 cm. In {{order to assess}} this weathering and to understand its mechanism, an experimental study {{was carried out in}} the field and laboratory. Field monitoring showed the combination of seasonal and diurnal freezing with a maximum of heave when the freezing front reached 5 cm depth. Bricks taken from the site were submitted to unidirectional freezing at capillary and vacuum saturation in the laboratory. Results showed that frost damage of bricks was favoured by high saturation level and repetition of freeze-thaw cycles. ...|$|R
50|$|Lycoris radiata is not frost-hardy and so {{can only}} be grown under glass or in a very {{sheltered}} position in countries like England which are <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>frost.</b> Bulbs {{can be stored in}} a dry environment between 45 - 55 degrees Fahrenheit (7 - 13 degrees Celsius). They should be planted in the spring in full sun in well-drained soil (e.g. sandy with some clay), 8 inches (20 cm) deep, with 6 - 12 inches (15 - 30 cm) between each bulb, and left undisturbed. Plants will flower in late summer or early fall, with stems around 24 - 28 inches (60 - 70 cm) tall. Leaves follow the flowers, remaining through the winter and disappearing in early summer.|$|R
