500|$|The school's {{teams are}} called [...] "Hoyas", a name whose origin is uncertain. Sometime before 1893, {{students}} {{well versed in}} classical languages invented the mixed Greek and Latin chant of [...] "Hoya Saxa", translating roughly as [...] "what (or such) rocks." [...] The school's baseball team, then called the <b>Stonewalls,</b> began in 1870, and football in 1874, and the chant likely refers {{to one of these}} teams. By the 1920s, the term [...] "Hoyas" [...] was used to describe groups on campus, and by 1928, campus sports writers started using it instead of the older team name, the [...] "Hilltoppers." [...] The name was picked up in the local publications, and became official shortly after. Jack the Bulldog has been the mascot of Georgetown athletics programs since 1962, and the school fight song is There Goes Old Georgetown.|$|E

"With men of a {{speculative}} turn," [...] writes Teufelsdrockh, [...] "there come seasons, meditative, sweet, yet awful hours, when {{in wonder}} and fear you ask yourself that unanswerable question: Who am I; {{the thing that}} can say 'I' (das Wesen das sich ICH nennt)? The world, with its loud trafficking, retires into the distance; and, through the paper-hangings, and <b>stonewalls,</b> and thick-plied tissues of Commerce and Polity, and all the living and lifeless integuments (of Society and a Body), wherewith your Existence sits surrounded,--the sight reaches forth into the void Deep, and you are alone with the Universe, and silently commune with it, as one mysterious Presence with another.|$|E

6000|$|At a {{sign from}} the Lord-General, Wildrake {{approached}} him as before. [...] "Comrade," [...] he said, [...] "your old friends the cavaliers look {{on me as}} their enemy, and conduct themselves towards me as if they desired to make me such. I profess they are labouring to their own prejudice; for I regard, and have ever regarded them, as honest and honourable fools, who were silly enough to run their necks into nooses and their heads against <b>stonewalls,</b> that a man called Stewart, and no other, should be king over them. Fools! are there no words made of letters that would sound as well as Charles Stewart, with that magic title beside them? Why, the word King is like a lighted lamp, that throws the same bright gilding upon any combination of the alphabet, and yet you must shed your blood for a name! But thou, for thy part, shalt have no wrong from me. Here is an order, well warranted, to clear the Lodge at Woodstock, and abandon it to thy master's keeping, or those whom he shall appoint. He will have his uncle and pretty cousin with him, doubtless. Fare thee well--think on what I told thee. They say beauty is a loadstone to yonder long lad thou dost wot of; but I reckon he has other stars at present to direct his course than bright eyes and fair hair. Be it as it may, thou knowst my purpose--peer out, peer out; keep a constant and careful look-out on every ragged patch that wanders by hedge-row or lane--these are days when a beggar's cloak may cover a king's ransom. There are some broad Portugal pieces for thee--something strange to thy pouch, I ween.--Once more, think on what thou hast heard, and," [...] he added, in a lower and more impressive tone of voice, [...] "forget what thou hast seen. My service to thy master;--and, yet once again, remember--and forget."--Wildrake made his obeisance, and, returning to his inn, left Windsor with all possible speed.|$|E
