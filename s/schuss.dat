40|$|International audienceSport {{events are}} often staged by {{destination}} marketers for branding purposes, {{to attract new}} tourists, and/or to address tourism seasonality issues, among other reasons. But before athletes vie for championships in far-away places often an equally vigorous competition has taken place months or in some cases, years earlier to determine the host cities. Such {{is the case for}} mega- events i. e., Olympic Games and FIFA World Cup as well as for second tier events including the International Ski Federation (FIS) Nordic World Ski Championships. One might perceive that cross country skiing involves quietly <b>schussing</b> through pine forests but at the elite level, nordic ski races are highly commercialized, featuring athletes in colorfully-clad skin suits adorned with corporate emblems, and the courses, lined with sponsor signs, finish in a stadium. The event atmosphere is like a rock concert: Large screens broadcast the races while pulsating music blares and fans dance (to keep warm). Food, beverage, and merchandise vendors display their wares for sale or sample. For those seeking sport in pristine wilderness environments, too much commercialism may be disconcerting, leading to shortened stays and negative referrals; conversely too few commercial opportunities linked to nature-based sport tourism may inhibit existing businesses and/or future investments, or lead to an event atmosphere that is blasé...|$|R
5000|$|Director and screenwriter John Huston {{had been}} {{a close friend of}} Wyler during his career. When he was twenty-eight and penniless, {{sleeping}} in parks in London, Huston returned to Hollywood {{to see if he could}} find work. Wyler, four years his senior, had met Huston when he was directing his father, Walter Huston, in A House Divided in 1931, and they got along well. Wyler read dialogue suggestions that Huston had given to his father Walter and hired John to work on the dialogue for the script. He later inspired Huston to become a director and became his [...] "early mentor." [...] When America entered World War II in 1941, Wyler, Huston, Anatole Litvak and Frank Capra, by then all directors, enlisted at the same time. Later in his career, Huston recalled his friendship with Wyler during an interview: Willy was certainly my best friend in the industry.... We seemed instantly to have many things in common.... Willy liked the things that I liked. We'd go down to Mexico. We'd go up in the mountains. And we'd gamble. He was a wonderful companion....He was equally capable of playing Beethoven on his violin, speeding around town on his motorcycle, or <b>schussing</b> down steep virgin snow trails.|$|R
