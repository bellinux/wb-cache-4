40|$|Background: Garlic oil {{which is}} the main active {{constituent}} of garlic has {{a wide range of}} pharmacological activities, and a broad antibacterial spectrum. It also has a strong anti-cancer activity, and can significantly inhibit a variety of tumors such as liver cancer, gastric cancer and colon cancer. The objective is to study the extraction process of garlic oil and its antibacterial effects. Materials and Methods: CO 2 <b>Supercritical</b> <b>extraction</b> was used to investigate the optimal processing conditions for garlic oil extraction; filter paper test and suspension dilution test were applied to determine the bacteriostatic action of garlic oil. Results: In the CO 2 <b>supercritical</b> <b>extraction</b> experiment, factors influencing the yield of garlic oil were: extraction pressure> extraction temperature> extraction time in descending order.

40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of <b>supercritical</b> <b>extraction</b> parameter on the oil extraction of Mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni) was investigated. <b>Supercritical</b> <b>extraction</b> was carried out using the operation pressures of 20, 25 and 30 MPa, and temperature was varied in 40, 50 and 60 °C. The parameter used for CO 2 flow rate was constant, 2 mL/min, with extraction time of 180 min by using matrix particle size of 0. 75 mm. Then, the extracted oils were tested for cytotoxic activity and properties. MTT assay was used as in vitro study to investigate the cytotoxic properties of the extracted on human fibroblast cells (HSF 1184). The study reveals that the extraction yield depends on the pressure and temperature. There is a significant difference of 40, 50 and 60 °C at different pressures, whereby increasing pressure leads to significant increase extraction yields.

To investigate the contribution of each of the binder components to overall weight loss of the acrylic-based binder, pure components as well as combination of different components were subjected to <b>supercritical</b> <b>extraction.</b> To enhance the extraction of binder, co-solvents were evaluated on the most extractable binder component and an optimal co-solvent loading was determined. <b>Supercritical</b> <b>extraction</b> experiments were then carried out and the effect of the co-solvent on the extraction profiles was examined. Enhancement in extraction was observed for the acrylic-based system whereas no overall enhancement was observed for the poly (vinyl butyral) -based system. To interpret the dynamics of <b>supercritical</b> <b>extraction,</b> diffusivities of the binder components of the acrylic-based and the poly (vinyl butyral based) multilayer ceramic capacitors were calculated, and were found {{to be in the same}} order of magnitude. Finally, visual analysis was performed on the acrylic-based system to suggest a mechanism that led to defects in these green ceramic bodies after the extraction process. <b>Supercritical</b> <b>extraction</b> with carbon dioxide at 10 - 40 MPa and 55 - 90 ⁰C was used to remove binder from multilayer green ceramic bodies. Defects such as cracking and delamination were occasionally observed in the green bodies following the extraction process, and these defects were attributed to pressure gradients that arise during depressurization from conditions of <b>supercritical</b> <b>extraction.</b> A model based on flow in porous media was thus developed to describe the temporal and spatial distribution of pressure within the green body during depressurization. The model incorporated the Peng-Robinson cubic equation of state to describe the pressure-volume-temperature behavior of the supercritical carbon dioxide, and the effect of changes in the viscosity of the supercritical fluid. The effects of the body size and gas-phase permeability on the pressure within the green body were examined...|$|E

40|$|Supercritical fluids are {{increasingly}} being used and promoted at a laboratory and pilot scale to produce high value, natural bioactives from biologically based raw materials. Supercritical CO 2 is overwhelmingly the solvent of choice for these operations, but is largely limited to the processing of dry raw materials and the extraction of low polarity, low molecular weight compounds. The use of co-solvents {{and the use of}} alternative ânear-criticalâ extraction fluids such as dimethyl ether show potential to mitigate these limitations. Commercialisation of new <b>supercritical</b> <b>extraction</b> processes has arguably been limited because the <b>supercritical</b> <b>extraction</b> process has been developed in isolation of other processing steps necessary to achieve a successful product. This study reviews recent developments in integrated processing that incorporate the use of supercritical fluids for bioseparations and in particular process schemes that produce high value natural bioactives. Integrated processes include prior operation (fermentation, extraction, enzyme pre-treatment, physical fractionation or size reduction) followed by <b>supercritical</b> <b>extraction</b> or fractionation and processes in which operations are carried out in situ in supercritical fluids (supercritical chromatography, enzymatic conversion, precipitation and coating of solutes).

40|$|AbstractSupercritical {{extraction}} processes {{have been}} widely commercialized since 1970 of the XX century {{and now they are}} technologically advanced. <b>Supercritical</b> <b>extraction</b> is used in a number of industrial branches. Significant achievements are observed in the field of plant raw materials processing. Scientific investigations have proved that plenty of raw materials can be processed with CO 2 <b>supercritical</b> <b>extraction.</b> The most popular extraction applications include extraction of hop (e. g. bitter acids and xanthohumol), coffee, tea, and many others. Hop extraction became standard practice of processing of hop cones into extract and almost entirely dominated hop processing market.

However, implications based on literature data published and authors’ experience prove that the cost of <b>supercritical</b> <b>extraction</b> processing is comparable to the cost of liquid extraction, and sometimes being even lower. The analysis of this technology allows for further reductions of extract production cost. Cost components and the specification of cost reductions by modification of process parameters were presented in this paper. Main business advantages can be obtained by accurate control of the amount of solvent stream in the plant system, which has an effect on energy consumption in all the important process loops.

Results from those extractions demonstrate that plutonium consistently partitioned into the residual fraction across all three INEEL soil preparations whereas americium partitioned 73 % into the iron/manganese fraction for soil preparation A, with the balance partitioning into the residual fraction. Plutonium and americium were extracted from the INEEL soil samples using a ligand-assisted <b>supercritical</b> fluid <b>extraction</b> technique.
