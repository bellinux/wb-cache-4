5|$|Tisca Chopra as Maya Awasthi ("Maa"): Ishaan's mother, {{who gave}} up her career to raise her children. Chopra tended to speak <b>softly</b> during filming and was {{subsequently}} required to re-record some scenes using automated dialogue replacement.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} is {{primarily}} fossorial, it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel. Dandelions seem to be its favorite food, and are also used as nesting material. During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females, and males and females may make purring (or cooing) sounds when they are together. Mothers seem to comfort the young by <b>softly</b> vocalizing, with the young twittering in response.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, {{the cannon}} {{appeared}} {{in front of}} the Green Building sporting a giant 21-pound gold-plated aluminum Brass Rat around its barrel, which was positioned to point towards Pasadena, and female MIT students mockingly posted pictures of themselves posing in bikinis with the cannon. It was revealed that preparations for the heist had been underway since December. MIT was <b>softly</b> criticized for not leaving a note explaining that the theft was a prank, as required by Caltech's pranking ethics, which were said to be more stringent than MIT's, but the prank was largely taken in good humor at both campuses.|$|E
5|$|Farmer {{formed the}} Jazztet in 1959, with the {{composer}} and tenor saxophonist Benny Golson, after each man independently {{came to the}} conclusion that the other should be a member of his new sextet. The Jazztet lasted until 1962, recorded several albums for Argo and Mercury Records, and assisted in the early careers of pianist McCoy Tyner and trombonist Grachan Moncur III. In the early 1960s Farmer established a trio with guitarist Jim Hall and bassist Steve Swallow; his relationship with Hall lasted from 1962 to 1964, and included two tours of Europe, one of which had concerts recorded for the BBC's Jazz 625 programme, which were later released on DVD. Hall left the second tour while the quartet, which included Swallow and drummer Pete La Roca, was engaged in Berlin, and a pianist replaced him; this was ultimately Steve Kuhn. In 1964, this new quartet recorded the album Sing Me <b>Softly</b> of the Blues for the Atlantic label. These bands played laid back, melodious music during a period when avant-garde jazz was becoming more common.|$|E
5|$|His next {{role was}} as mob hitman Jackie Cogan in Andrew Dominik's 2012 Killing Them <b>Softly,</b> {{based on the}} novel Cogan's Trade by George V. Higgins. In 2013, Pitt starred in World War Z, a thriller about a zombie apocalypse, based on Max Brooks' novel of the same name. Pitt also {{produced}} the film. World War Z grossed $540million at the box office worldwide, becoming Pitt's highest grossing picture. Next in 2013, he produced, and played a small role in, 12 Years a Slave, a historical drama based on the autobiography of Solomon Northup. The film received critical acclaim and was nominated for nine Academy Awards, winning three, including Best Picture. Also in 2013, Pitt had a supporting role in Ridley Scott's The Counselor.|$|E
5|$|Paranotal {{hypothesis}}: This hypothesis {{suggests that}} the insect's wings developed from paranotal lobes, a preadaptation found in insect fossils that {{is believed to have}} assisted stabilization while hopping or falling. In favor of this hypothesis is the tendency of most insects, when startled while climbing on branches, to escape by dropping to the ground. Such lobes would have served as parachutes and enable the insect to land more <b>softly.</b> The theory {{suggests that the}}se lobes gradually grew larger and in a later stage developed a joint with the thorax. Even later would appear the muscles to move these crude wings. This model implies a progressive increase in the effectiveness of the wings, starting with parachuting, then gliding and finally active flight. Still, lack of substantial fossil evidence of the development of the wing joints and muscles poses a major difficulty to the theory, as does the seemingly spontaneous development of articulation and venation, and it has been largely rejected by experts in the field.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season {{varies according to}} latitude, taking place from April to July in Queensland, January to May in northern New South Wales, December to February in southern New South Wales, and October to February in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The male yellow-tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up crest and spreading his tail feathers to display his yellow plumage. <b>Softly</b> growling, he approaches the female and bows {{three or four times}} to her. His eye ring may also flush a deeper pink. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees, generally eucalypts, which are either living or dead. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. A 1994 study of nesting sites in Eucalyptus regnans forest in the Strzelecki Ranges in eastern Victoria found the average age of trees used for hollows by the yellow-tailed black cockatoo to be 228 years. The authors noted that the proposed 80–150 year rotation time for managed forests would impact on the numbers of suitable trees.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{a passage}} is arrived at which sounds {{rather like a}} chorale, with the violas and cellos <b>softly</b> singing a hymnlike tune that will {{gradually}} build {{up to the first}} climax of the symphony.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{great number}} of special casts meant to evade {{problems}} like trees behind the angler (roll cast), the pulling of the line on the fly by the action of the stream, or to make the fly land more <b>softly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Blowing more <b>softly</b> {{lowers the}} pitch; blowing harder raises it. Breath force {{can change the}} pitch by three semitones. This is why ocarinas {{generally}} have no tuning mechanism or dynamic range, and why {{it is hard to}} learn to play one in tune.|$|E
25|$|Magneto is {{the final}} boss of the Sega Genesis game, X-Men. However, after {{defeating}} Mojo, players must <b>softly</b> press the reset button on the console to delete a computer virus emitted on Mojo's level before time runs out, in order to face him.|$|E
25|$|In The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, the {{deafness}} inconsistency (while not the others) was {{solved by}} Dr. Roylott (suspecting the deafness of snakes) <b>softly</b> {{knocking on the}} wall in addition to whistling. While snakes are deaf, they are sensitive to vibration.|$|E
25|$|Niittymäki {{started the}} 2005–06 {{season as the}} Flyers' backup goalie for Esche. On October 14, 2005, Niittymäki let in a {{questionable}} goal immediately after a faceoff on the Pittsburgh Penguins' side of center ice. He was watching a JumboTron replay when Maxime Talbot <b>softly</b> shot at him and scored.|$|E
25|$|Bagsværd Church is a Lutheran {{church in}} Bagsværd on the {{northern}} outskirts of Copenhagen, Denmark. Designed in 1968 by Jørn Utzon, it was completed in 1976. The building {{is considered to be}} a masterpiece of contemporary church architecture, especially its bright, naturally illuminated interior and its ceiling straddled with <b>softly</b> rounded vaulting.|$|E
25|$|Renoir's {{paintings}} are notable for their vibrant light and saturated color, most often focusing on people in intimate and candid compositions. The female nude {{was one of}} his primary subjects. In characteristic Impressionist style, Renoir suggested the details of a scene through freely brushed touches of color, so that his figures <b>softly</b> fuse with one another and their surroundings.|$|E
25|$|The Peter Lorre {{voice in}} the Spike Jones RCA Victor {{recording}} of the song My Old Flame. When talking <b>softly,</b> the voice sounds much like Lorre. When the character segués into a manic rant for a few lines, the voice anticipates the Ludwig von Drake characterization. Frees appeared on several other Spike Jones recordings including Too Young and Pop Corn Sack.|$|E
25|$|Typical surfing {{instruction}} is best performed one-on-one, {{but can also}} {{be done in a}} group setting. The most popular surf locations offer perfect surfing conditions for beginners, as well as challenging breaks for advanced students. The ideal conditions for learning would be small waves that crumble and break <b>softly,</b> as opposed to the steep, fast-peeling waves desired by more experienced surfers. When available, a sandy seabed is generally safer.|$|E
25|$|Due to Mexican {{government}} regulations, these stations, {{like all}} {{radio stations in}} Mexico, must air La Hora Nacional ("The Mexican National Hour") on Sunday evenings at 10pm and Himno Nacional Mexicano (the Mexican National Anthem) at midnight and 6 am. In addition, they must also give station identification in Spanish. This is usually done <b>softly</b> or during commercial breaks so the listeners on the American side won't usually notice it.|$|E
25|$|In certain game situations, when {{a runner}} is on {{first and the}} batter bunts the ball or hits the ball <b>softly,</b> which causes the third baseman to rush in {{to get the ball}} and throw to first base, the catcher must cover third base so that the runner from first base does not advance to third base on the play and this then forces the third baseman to cover home plate.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the novelist}} and essayist Jerome K. Jerome {{was born in}} the town, he never wrote about it. Some writers have, {{including}} the Walsall born John Petty (1919–1973) who set a number of his books in Walsall, most famously Five Fags a Day (1956). More recently the comic novelist Paul McDonald has used Walsall as a location for Surviving Sting (2001) and Kiss Me <b>Softly,</b> Amy Turtle (2004).|$|E
25|$|The McGurk {{effect can}} be {{observed}} when the listener is also the speaker or articulator. While looking at oneself {{in the mirror and}} articulating visual stimuli while listening to another auditory stimulus, a strong McGurk {{effect can be}} observed. In the other condition, where the listener speaks auditory stimuli <b>softly</b> while watching another person articulate the conflicting visual gestures, a McGurk effect can still be seen, although it is weaker.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War American {{servicemen}} {{stationed in}} Europe began {{to experience the}} benefits of the nimble sports cars, particularly in Britain, and many shipped them home on their return. US automakers responded with a pair of home grown two-seat models, the sporting Chevrolet Corvette, a fiberglass-bodied 6-cylinder roadster with few creature comforts introduced in 1953, and the larger, more comfortable, existing component-based Ford Thunderbird. The Thunderbird was a <b>softly</b> sprung car, with a powerful V8 engine, that came both as a convertible and roadster with removable hardtop.|$|E
25|$|<b>Softly,</b> {{well before}} the winter dawn, the yellow monster lurched towards the grey façade. A lone rook stirred in the tall beeches nearby, troubled by the {{relentless}} purring of powerful motors. Down beyond the stream, what remains of his ornamental garden, a few regal bamboo blades, trembled in the night breeze. A mighty arm nudged the building. There was no crash, not even a rumble. Masonry fell with a rustle and hiss of dust down ivy-clad walls, to thud in moss. Within the hour, Frescati was no more.|$|E
25|$|After his somber {{meeting with}} his chieftains, Haile Selassie visited Sir Sidney Barton at the British Legation. He spoke <b>softly</b> to Sir Sidney but to the point. Britain had {{encouraged}} him with fine words and had made many promises. However, Britain had provided Ethiopia with few guns for which the Ethiopians had paid cash. Haile Selassie stressed that he had risked his own life for Ethiopia {{but also for the}} League of Nations. He asked Sir Sidney whether Britain would now come to his aid in this hour of direst need. Shortly afterwards Haile Selassie drove away, his mouth grim with disappointment.|$|E
25|$|Sudipto Sen was the {{chairman}} and managing director of the Saradha Group. Sen was described as a <b>softly</b> spoken, charming, and forceful orator. At the time of his arrest, he was in his mid-50s. In his youth, he was known as Shankaraditya Sen, and was part of the Naxalite movement in West Bengal. He changed his name to Sudipto Sen and may have had plastic surgery sometime in the 1990s, after which he became associated with land development projects in South Kolkata. The land bank he formed in around 2000 became the catalyst for enticing early customers into his Ponzi scheme.|$|E
