40|$|The use of vortex {{generators}} (VGs) is a prevailing {{technology in}} large modern wind turbines {{due to its}} potential to increase wind turbine annual energy production [39] by re-energizing the momentum energy in the boundary layer and, as a consequence, delay the flow separation. Many researchers have been extensively studying the effects of VGs on airfoil sections but none have included the VGs’ baseplate into their studies. This research aims to fill this gap and hopes to contribute toward the current body of work in VG research by studying {{the effect of the}} baseplate on the airfoil aerodynamics. The main goal of this thesis is to identify the effect of the baseplate of the vortex generators. The effect of VG positions, VGs with baseplate, Reynolds number, baseplate height and roughness model were studied in order to achieve the goal. Five baseplate shapes were studied in this research in order to cover all possible geometries in the real applications. Airfoil section with VGs were shown to be effective in delaying flow separation for both FFA W 3 - 301 and DU 91 W 2 - 250 airfoils. From the results of the simulations of airfoil sections with baseplate and VGs, baseplate shape no. 2 (sharp bevel) shows an early flow separation and has the worst performance. The baseplate shape no. 5 (”S” <b>shaped</b> <b>bevel)</b> shows results that were close to the airfoil without baseplate. In studying the airfoils with roughness, it was seen that by adding VGs, the loss in lift was restored. A reference wind turbine model was used in order to compute the wind turbine’s annual energy production. The rough airfoil had an annual energy production approximately 18 % less than the clean airfoil for FFA W 3 - 301 and approximately 13 % for DU 91 -W 2 - 250. By adding VGs to the rough airfoil section, the AEP increased by around 10 % for FFA W 3 - 301 airfoil with VGs at 0. 20 c and approximately 5 % for DU 91 -W 2 - 250 airfoil with VGs at 0. 20 c. Taking the baseplate (except baseplate shape no. 2) into consideration, both the maximum lift and aerodynamic efficiency saw slight improvements in both airfoils. This could be a consequence of the baseplate which allowed the flow to pass resulting in accelerating flow being able to be energized by the VGs. From the studies, the baseplate shape no. 2 (sharp bevel) had performed poorly in simulations with both airfoils, although the flow separation was seen to be delayed at high Reynolds numbers. However, due to the simplicity in manufacturing, this shape may still be used in practice and as such, it is highly recommended that the baseplate configuration is taken into accounted during the design process. This research has shown that it is advantageous to have baseplates with a smooth bevel likes baseplate shape no. 1 (beveled edge) and 5 (”S” <b>shaped</b> <b>bevel)</b> in order to avoid unexpected flow separation. The effect of the baseplate could also be more important to account for in simulations as the height of the baseplate might increase in the future, if a larger VG is needed...|$|E

5000|$|The mortise chisel, {{even in its}} heavyweight [...] "pigsticker" [...] form, is used {{differently}} from a twybill, although the two may be used together. The twybill cuts the sides of mortices, along the grain. Its action is a splitting and prying one, so only requires a handle for leverage and is never struck. Mortise chisels are used for heavy chopping across the grain, are nearly always struck, and are used to square up the ends of square-ended mortises. Both tools are used for levering out chunks when first clearing out a mortise and so have similarly <b>shaped</b> <b>bevels,</b> often with a curved bevel surface for a better fulcrum action.|$|R
40|$|In {{industrial}} production variations occur during processing {{and in the}} materials behavior. These variations are unavoidable. They can lead to products that {{do not meet the}} quality requirements. At worst, a stop of the production process can be caused. In today’s process design of hot forging processes these variations cannot be considered. This thesis focuses on the development of new methods and strategies for the identification and quantification of uncertainties and variations of all necessary input data to describe entire process chains in hot forging and further their implementation in numerical tools for process design, in particular in the FEM. Based on the well-established resampling methods a new method applicable for complex, non-linear, microstructure-based material models is presented. This method implements the variations in the material behavior by distributions of model parameters. Combining this new method with DoE-based simulation studies it is possible to predict all necessary product-relevant and process-relevant target values in statistical distributions. In this case, product-relevant values are e. g. grain sizes and recrystallized fractions. Process-relevant target values are e. g. forging loads and tool stresses. The results are validated by the production of near net <b>shape</b> <b>bevel</b> gears. Thus, an important basis for the future consideration of process and material variations is provided, which enables for estimating the robustness of processing conditions and product qualities during the design phase...|$|R

The blades are often scimitar <b>shaped</b> with a <b>bevelled</b> 'cutting' edge, and the other edges are rolled to prevent injury. The other common blade shape is an elongated diamond with all edges and the point rolled or otherwise made safe. While this makes knife juggling much safer than popularly assumed, knives can still cause severe trauma injuries to the head and body when falling from a height. Because of this, the juggling of large lumps of metal should only be attempted by competent club jugglers who understand the risks.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} beveling of quartz crystal blanks is presented in this paper. Two issues in the beveling are addressed: beveling time and the <b>shape</b> of <b>bevel.</b> The time needed for beveling is determined by material removal rate. The concept of critical gap height is introduced to evaluate the bevel profile. In addition, a side effect, frequency shift is also studied. Seven potential relevant process factors: blank quantity, powder/blank ratio, powder type, machine rpm, powder changing time, barrel diameter and powder heating were identified. The influences of these process factors on material removal rate, critical gap height and frequency shift were studied using Design of Experiments (DOE). It is shown from the results that (1) machine rpm has the most significant effect on material removal rate, followed by barrel diameter. Material removal rate increases with machine rpm and barrel diameter; (2) steeper bevel profiles {{can be achieved by}} using barrels of smaller diameter and finer powders; and (3) machine rpm has the most significant effect on the frequency shift, followed by barrel diameter and powder type. The frequency shift increases with the machine rpm and barrel diameter. Using finer powders can reduce the frequency shift...|$|R

In the {{detection}} process of errors tooth surface model is constructed based on coordinate data of limited the actual tooth surface sampling points.

NURBS method is used to calculate non-uniform knot vector, NURBS control points and B-Spline inverse and reconstruct tooth surface. Reconstruction of spiral bevel gears in using NURBS is achieved and the tooth surface reconstruction is drawn out in Open GL in VC environment. And then reconstruction error on the tooth surface is analyzed. It proves that using the method of NURBS to reconstruct spiral bevel gear tooth surface is correct and feasible...|$|R
40|$|Needle {{insertion}} into {{soft tissue}} {{is one of}} the most common medical interventions. This study provides macroscopic and microscopic observations of needle–gel interactions. A gelatin mixture is used as a soft-tissue simulant. For the macroscopic studies, system parameters, such as insertion velocity, needle diameter, gel elasticity, needle tip <b>shape</b> (including <b>bevel</b> angle) and insertion motion profile, are varied, while the maximum insertion force and maximum needle deflection are recorded. The needle tip and gel interactions are observed using confocal microscopic images. Observations indicate that increasing the insertion velocity and needle diameter results in larger insertion forces and smaller needle deflections. Varying the needle bevel angle from 8 ° to 82 ° results in the insertion force increasing mono- tonically, while the needle deflection does not. These variations are due to the coupling between gel rupture and tip compression interactions, which are observed during microscopic studies. Increasing the gel elasticity results in larger insertion forces and needle deflections. Varying the tip shapes demonstrates that bevel-tipped needles produce the larg- est deflection, but insertion force does not vary among the tested tip shapes. Insertion with different motion profiles are performed. Results show that adding 1 Hz rotational motion during linear insertion decreases the needle deflection. Increasing the rotational motion from 1 Hz to 5 Hz decreases the insertion force, while the needle deflection remains the same. A high-velocity (250 mm/s and 300 mm/s) tapping during insertion yields no significant decrease in needle deflection and a slight increase in insertion force...|$|R
5000|$|Double bevel or {{compound}} bevel — A back bevel, {{similar to}} a sabre or flat grind, is put on the blade behind the edge bevel (the bevel which is the foremost cutting surface). This back bevel keeps the section of blade behind the edge thinner which improves cutting ability. Being less acute at the edge than a single bevel, sharpness is sacrificed for resilience: such a grind is much less prone to chipping or rolling than a single bevel blade. This profile is commonly found in Japanese swords, such as the familiar katana. The <b>shape</b> of the <b>bevel</b> is much more efficient in reducing drag than the sabre grind typically found on Western sword blades. In practice, double bevels are common {{in a variety of}} edge angles and back bevel angles, and Western kitchen knives generally have a double bevel, with an edge angle of 14-16° (included angle of 28-32°) and a maximum of 40° as specified by International standard ISO 8442.1 (knives for the preparation of food).|$|R
40|$|Background: Post-dural {{puncture}} headache (PDPH) is an iatrogenic {{complication of}} spinal anesthesia. Reported {{risk factors for}} PDPH include sex, age, pregnancy, needle tip <b>shape</b> and size, <b>bevel</b> orientation, approach and others. Little is known regarding the effect of different approaches on the incidence of PDPH. Objectives: In this study we aimed to compare the incidence of PDPH {{in the case of}} me-dian and paramedian approaches in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia for ortho-pedic operations. Patients and Methods: Patients scheduled for orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthe-sia between 2007 and 2008 were studied in a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. The patients were randomized to receive spinal anesthesia by either a median (n = 75) or paramedian (n = 75) approach through a 25 -gauge Crawford needle. No pre-medication was given, and all patients received 500 mL of normal saline intravenous-ly and 4 mL of 0. 5 % isobaric Marcaine 30 minutes prior to surgery in both approaches. Results: Fifteen patients (10 %) developed PDPH. There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of PDPH in both groups, with 7 (9. 3 %) patients in the median approach group versus 8 (10. 7 %) in the paramedian approach group developing typical PDPH (P = 0. 875). However, a significant difference in PDPH incidence (P = 0. 041) was observed between females (9; 16. 7 %) and males (6; 6. 3 %) ...|$|R
