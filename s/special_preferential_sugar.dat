40|$|On October 1 st the European Commission {{adopted a}} {{regulation}} reducing EU sugar quotas by 862, 475 tonnes. The combined 'A' and 'B' sugar quotas will fall by 5. 71 % from 15, 103, 585 tonnes to 14, 241, 110 tonnes for 2003 (the {{only difference between}} 'A' and 'B' quotas lies in the levies charged {{to cover the cost}} of export refunds). According to the Commission 'the reduction is necessary to bring the EU in conformity with their WTO obligations'. The regulation also cuts EU refiners' 'maximum supply needs'. This will result in a further reduction in ACP access under the <b>special</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> arrangement. In the mean time the German sugar analyst F. O.

Comment: As can be seen there is rarely a correlation between the quotas allocated under the sugar regime and actual production. EU quota cuts will not necessarily have any impact on EU production. However, the reduction of the maximum supply needs will definitely result in lost export markets and lost revenues for ACP exporters.

40|$|The ongoing trade negotiations, {{unilateral}} trade {{concessions and}} {{obligations under the}} WTO are pushing the EU sugar regime to undertake reforms. These reforms will alter the positions of developing countries in the global sugar markets. This paper will describe the trade preferences granted to developing countries under the EU sugar regime. Sugar imports into the EU from the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) {{are expected to be}} totally liberalised from year 2009 onwards because of the ?Everything But Arms? (EBA) concession. During the transition period until year 2009, the EBA concession is gradually granting quota preferences and partial duty-free access to sugar imports from the LDCs. Simultaneously, the temporary import quotas (<b>Special</b> <b>Preferential</b> <b>Sugar)</b> given to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries are assumed to be decreasing during the transition period. Within this background, a complete unilateral liberalisation of the EU sugar sector is simulated to depict the winners and losers in the global sugar markets if no preferences are governing the imports of sugar into the EU. The supply responses, which strongly affect the outcomes, are dependent on both the nature of substitution for sugar {{as well as on the}} efficiency of sugar production in different countries. The multi-region general equilibrium framework (GTAP) is used for this analysis. The results show that small concessions will not threaten the EU internal market, but total liberalisation of sugar imports from the LDCs will be a major threat to the EU sugar regime. The current regime limits sugar imports from all developing countries or some efficient producers, if the cost data is a right estimate of the potential supply response from developing countries. The LDCs will be the winners under the EBA concession supported by the current regime, but a few efficient sugar producers will be the winners if the current regime is entirely liberalised.

40|$|In a {{press release}} on July 10 th 2003 the European Commission {{condemned}} the Brazilian, Australian and Thai challenge to the EU's 'C' sugar exports, claiming it was 'nothing less than {{an attack on the}} EU's trade preferences for developing countries'. The Commission argued that the challenge risks 'undermining the benefits of the EU regime for many sugar-dependent developing countries, especially ACP countries'. EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy maintained that the WTO action could 'destabilise the sugar-dependent economies of small ACP countries', whilst merely deflecting attention form the real causes of depressed world market prices, namely the rapid expansion of Brazilian and Australian sugar exports (from 1. 6 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes in the case of Brazil). Comment: While the Commission maintains that EU exports of sugar are largely the result of the preferential import of 1. 9 million tonnes of sugar, {{the reality is that the}} EU has been exporting around 5 million tonnes per annum in recent years, with the system of quota administration within the EU encouraging overproduction. The Commission implies that the EBA preferences extended to LDCs are allowing increased sugar exports from developing countries. However the EU maintains in place a maximum-supply-needs ceiling which limits the total amount of preferential sugar imported into the EU. Increased LDC exports of sugar are thus at the expense of ACP beneficiaries of the <b>special</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> arrangement. This will remain the case until the EU raises the maximum-supply-needs ceiling or LDCs are given full duty-free access in 2009. While the European Commission maintains that the WTO challenge is likely to destabilise ACP sugar-dependent economies, the eventual extension of CAP reform to the sugar sector, involving a shift from price support to direct aid to farmers, is likely to profoundly affect the value of sugar preferences extended to ACP sugar suppliers. The prospect of sugar-sector reform may however have been deferred by the June 26 th 2003 decision to retain the vast majority of the funds generated by 'modulation' for investment in rural development rather than additional sectoral reform.

40|$|World sugar {{production}} has consistently overrun {{demand in the}} past five years. Moreover, in 2017 the European Sugar Regime will expire, ending the quota system and <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> prices, largely affecting small producers, particularly in Africa. Diversification emerges as an option for sugar-oriented mills. Two evident alternatives are ethanol and electricity production that allow better use of molasses and cane fibers, respectively. Molasses is the cheapest feedstock for ethanol production, while the cane fibers—in the form of bagasse—are readily available at the mill. The transition from sugar to sugar, ethanol and electricity may require substantial investment capital, yet our results show that significant progress can start at relatively small cost. In this work, we use simulations to explore the impact of ethanol and electricity production in an existing sugar mill in Mozambique. In spite of the large amounts of energy obtained from ambitious scenarios, such as Ethanol- 2 and Ethanol/EE, molasses-based ethanol (Ethanol- 1 scenario) seems more attractive in economical and infrastructural terms.

Three effects were noted when various sugars were added to MeSGal preloaded cells: (i) no decrease in intracellular MeSGalP concentration after addition of fructose, sucrose, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside, glycerol, 6 -deoxyglucose, alpha-methyl D-glucoside, 2 -deoxygalactose, glucose 1 -phosphate, or glucose 6 -phosphate; (ii) slow loss of preaccumulated MeSGalP evoked by lactose, 2 -deoxy-D-glucose, or unlabeled MeSGal; and (iii) a short lag followed by extremely rapid expulsion of intracellular MeSGalP elicited by glucose or mannose and a slower expulsion elicited by glucosamine. The expelled compound was free MeSGal, indicating the involvement of dephosphorylation in the expulsion mechanism. Deoxyglucose inhibited the expulsion evoked by mannose, and prepoisoning of cells with fluoride or arsenate prevented the glucose-dependent expulsion. The expulsion is due to activation of an expulsion mechanism rather than to turnover of MeSGalP and leak of internal MeSGal with concomitant inhibition of MeSGal influx. The results {{suggest the need for}} phosphotransferase-dependent translocation of a <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> or accumulation of the sugar catabolite for expulsion activation.

40|$|Genomic {{analysis}} and physiological experiments {{conducted on the}} lignocellulosic biomass degrading bacterium C. phytofermentans, indicates that it can degrade and utilize a wide-range of carbohydrates as possible growth substrates. Previous experiments characterized gene expression using custom whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays. The results indicated that C. phytofermentans utilizes ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters for carbohydrate uptake and does not use the sole phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (PTS) {{for any of the}} tested substrates. Distinct sets of Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZy) genes were also up-regulated on specific substrates indicative of C. phytofermentans ability to selectively degrade lignocellulosic biomass. We also identified a highly expressed cluster of genes which includes seven extracellular glycoside hydrolases and two ABC transporters with unknown specificity on a number of substrates. These results lead to the hypothesis that when grown on plant biomass, C. phytofermentansis capable of degrading and transporting all major carbohydrate components of lignocellulose biomass. To test this, C. phytofermentans was grown on three different lignocellulosic biomass substrates (Brachypodium distachyon, cornstover, and switchgrass). Gene expression and HPLC analysis indicated that C. phytofermentans is utilizing multiple substrates with multiple sugar ABC transporter clusters, glycoside hydrolases, and sugar utilization pathways being expressed. To further test this,the sugar utilization pattern for C. phytofermentans was investigated. Growth studies were performed on individual saccaharides (glucose, cellobiose, xylose, and fucose) as well as combinations of all these sugars. From these studies we determined that C. phytofermentans does not show a characteristic diauxic shift indicative of <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> utilization or carbon catabolite repression (CCR). This result was supported further by HPLC analysis indicating that co-utilization of sugars was occurring, however their were differences in the rates of consumption. Expression analysis of dual sugar combinations of glucose/cellobiose, glucose/xylose, and glucose/fucose also shows that genes involved in the transport and utilization of each sugar are expressed.

The theoretical discussion {{eventually led to}} the hypothesis that voters vote non-strategically according to their preferences, as the probability of owning the marginal vote and in turn determining the outcome with a large number of voters is very low. If we add that they weigh their preferences with the impact that the political outcome has on their economic well-being, we {{come to the conclusion that}} if the latter is high, they vote instrumentally, if it is low, they are likely to vote expressively. A unique data set on a natural experiment in Switzerland allows us to test this hypothesis. Citizens of the canton of Zurich voted in 2009 on the highly controversial issue whether to tax non-working and hence mobile foreign residents at a <b>special</b> <b>preferential</b> tax base in order to attract them instrumentally as tax payers or to tax all persons at the same base according to general tax principles.

This outcome raises a more {{fundamental question}} on the design of the democracy. It cannot be overlooked that the two groups voted on two different issues. Rural voter's choice was marginal in the sense that they asked: Should we partly give up our tax principles to obtain additional revenues? Their answer was yes.

40|$|The {{instability}} {{of families in}} the contemporary (especially western) world puts in jeopardy effective parenting and healthy child development. This paper reviews some statistical evidence of the disintegration of families, especially in the United States, {{and the impact of}} fragmented families upon children. Clearly, being raised by both parents in a home with healthy marital stability is the most advantageous environmental factor for successful child development. However, because so many contemporary social trends thwart the formation and maintenance of healthy, marital parenting, there is a great need today for additional institutions that will provide an effective support system and safety net for children and their parents when marriages struggle, fail, or fail to form. Religion and religious communities can provide very valuable back-up support for parenting and child development. While contemporary {{instability of}} marriage formation and maintenance may suggest that parenting and child development are undervalued in many societies, this article reports that parenting is explicitly protected in multiple provisions in the text of national constitutions of nearly all nations in the world today. A survey of contemporary national constitutions shows that formal legal commitment to parenting and child development is emphatic and nearly ubiquitous globally. In political theory of the enlightenment (the basis for liberal democracy) parenting and childhood are given <b>special</b> <b>preferential</b> constitutional treatment because effective parenting is considered critical for the wellbeing of society and individuals. Good parenting provides protection for children; is an expression of the interdependent connectedness of human nature; enhances individual rights and welfare; and is essential to sustainable liberal democracy. Many social science studies indicate that participation in religion generally has a positive impact upon the quality of parenting, and upon the resulting healthy, positive development of children parents. Parenting and religious have mutually-reinforcing interests and concerns. While some unusual religious doctrines and practices are harmful to children, most research confirms that the influence of religion upon parenting and children usually is beneficial. Research also suggests a correlation between lack of protection for religion and violence in society. Protecting religious liberty, thus, increases social goods, sustains social stability, reduces inter-group violence, and that enhances the quality of parenting and childhood. Because we live in such difficult times with such significant challenges for the children, their parents, and for parenting, there is particular need for institutional support for parenting. Religion can provide such needed support. In conclusion, this article recommends that nations protect religions and religious liberty {{for the sake of the}} childre...|$|R

He told the house that the slaves were [...] "as mildly and as humanely managed in Demerara, as in the Islands, or as is compatible with a state of slavery and pressure" [...] and that [...] "there {{can be no doubt}} that the revolt in Demerara is to be attributed to the debates which took place in this House last year, and to the notice preceding them". His only other contribution to Parliamentary debates was in 1825, when he supported retaining the <b>preferential</b> tariff on <b>sugar</b> imported from the West Indies. He had been an active member of the London Society of West India Planters and Merchants, attending 33 meetings between 1824 -1829.|$|R

The aim of this thesis is to understand and eliminate carbon catabolite repression (CCR) in Escherichia coli for efficient utilization of multiple energy and carbon sources simultaneously. We studied a new CCR hierarchy that causes the <b>preferential</b> utilization of <b>sugars</b> (arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose) over a short-chain fatty acid (propionate). Meanwhile, the native promoters of xylose catabolic genes and xylose transporter genes were replaced with synthetic constitutive promoters to construct an E. coli strain capable of co-metabolizing glucose and xylose by eliminating the CCR of xylose metabolism by glucose. We showed that such an approach can provide a potential to eliminate CCR. This knowledge will be valuable to help strain improvement strategies for the simultaneous consumption of sugar mixtures, leading to shorter fermentation time and higher substrate range and productivity. ope...|$|R
40|$|Carbon catabolite {{repression}} (CCR) {{is a well-known}} phenomenon that involves the preferential utilization of glucose as a carbon source. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the CAMP receptor protein (CRP) mediate CCR. Recently, a second CCR hierarchy {{that leads to the}} preferential consumption of arabinose over xylose, mediated by arabinose-bound AraC, has been identified. In this study, we report yet another CCR hierarchy that causes the <b>preferential</b> utilization of <b>sugars</b> (arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose) over a short-chain fatty acid (propionate). Expression of the propionate catabolic (prpBCDE) genes is down-regulated in the presence of these sugars. Sugar-mediated repression of the propionate catabolic genes is independent of sugar-specific regulators such as AraC and dependent on global regulators of sugar transport such as the cAMP-CRP complex and the Phosphotransferase System (PTS). Inhibition of the prpBCDE promoter is encountered during rapid sugar uptake and metabolism. This unique regulatory crosstalk between sugar metabolism and fatty acid metabolism may help provide new insights into CRP-dependent {{catabolite repression}} acting in conjunction with non-carbohydrate metabolism. close...|$|R
40|$|General {{problems}} of socio-economic development of Russia and Mongolia, due to raw material orientation of their economies: inadequate development of social infrastructure, dependence on price fluctuations in world commodity markets etc., are reviewed in this paper. The recommendations {{to address these}} problems by means of international economic integration of these countries at three levels - global, regional and transboundary (interregional) - are given. In particular, participation of Mongolia in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is discussed. Special {{attention is paid to}} the model of interregional partnership as a primary level of cooperation. The mechanism of this economic partnership is based on the principles of joint activities between business and government, federal and regional authorities and economic entities of both countries. Instruments of implementation of these principles are proposed, namely - creation of <b>special</b> institutions and <b>preferential</b> treatment. Finally, a specific example of interregional cooperation between Russia and Mongolia is extensively studied...|$|R
