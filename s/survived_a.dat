5|$|According {{to another}} urban legend, daddy long legs (Pholcidae) have potent venom, but their fangs are {{too short to}} deliver the poison. This myth might have arisen due to its {{similarity}} in appearance with the Brown recluse spider. In a 2004 episode of Discovery Channel's MythBusters, it was shown that host Adam Savage <b>survived</b> <b>a</b> bite from the spider.|$|E
5|$|Barker {{was a heavy}} smoker until 1972, when he gave up {{the habit}} after having a pre-cancerous growth removed from his throat; he took to {{drinking}} wine and using placebo cigarettes to maintain his concentration and help him sleep.

30|$|By contrast, in Topology 3, three {{components}} might fail at the infrastructure level. Four components will <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> failure of VM 1, one will <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> failure of VM 2 and one will <b>survive</b> <b>a</b> failure of VM 3. Statistically, {{there is now}} only 33 % chances that a large part (i.e., 80 %) of the system survives. The service layer of Topology 3 is thus less robust to failure in the infrastructure than the one of Topology 2.|$|R

5|$|After being {{recalled}} from Germania, Germanicus celebrated {{a triumph}} in Rome in AD17, {{the first full}} triumph that the city had seen since Augustus's own in 29BC. As a result, in AD18 Germanicus was granted control over {{the eastern part of}} the empire, just as both Agrippa and Tiberius had received before, and was clearly the successor to Tiberius.

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Norman conquest, Dorchester was not a place of great significance; the Normans did build a castle but it has not <b>survived.</b> <b>A</b> priory was also founded, in 1364, though this also has since disappeared.

In {{the time of}} Edward III (1312–1377), the town was governed by bailiffs and burgesses, with the number of burgesses increasing to fifteen by the reign of James I (1566–1625).|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the premiere, Italy had {{experienced}} political and social unrest for several years. The start of the Holy Year in December 1899 attracted the religious to the city, but also brought threats from anarchists and other anticlericals. Police received warnings of an anarchist bombing of the theatre, and instructed Mugnone (who had <b>survived</b> <b>a</b> theatre bombing in Barcelona), that in an emergency he was to strike up the royal march. The unrest caused the premiere to be postponed by one day, to 14January.|$|E
5|$|Corzine {{has been}} the only New Jersey {{governor}} in recent memory to make any headway in addressing the crisis of municipal funding. While not directly touching the third rail of New Jersey governance – property taxes – Corzine's reform of the school funding formula (passed and signed in January 2008) resulted in significant relief to many New Jersey towns with outsize school costs but limited tax base. The plan <b>survived</b> <b>a</b> legal challenge and was declared constitutional by the New Jersey Supreme Court on May 28, 2009.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Han <b>survived</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} purges that {{were caused by}} {{factional}} strife within the Workers' Party. Han, motivated by personal grievances against his rival writers, sometimes acted as the force behind the purges within the cultural establishment as well. Han himself was purged in 1962. In his works, Han offered {{some of the earliest}} known contributions to the cult of personality of Kim Il-sung. His influence is felt in North Korea even today, though his name has been forgotten from official histories. Han's best known work, the anti-American novella Jackals, however, has been invoked in the 2000s.|$|E
