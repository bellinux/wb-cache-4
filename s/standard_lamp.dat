60|$|Let me tell it {{in a few}} words. No {{letter or}} {{telegram}} had come to me at Southampton, and I reached the little villa at Streatham about ten o'clock that night in a fever of alarm. Was she dead or alive? Where were all my nightly dreams of the open arms, the smiling face, the words of praise for her man who had risked his life to humor her whim? Already I was down from the high peaks and standing flat-footed upon earth. Yet some good reasons given might still lift me to the clouds once more. I rushed down the garden path, hammered at the door, heard the voice of Gladys within, pushed past the staring maid, and strode into the sitting-room.

40|$|The two Brewer spectrophotometers of the Finnish Meteorological Institute at Jokioinen and Sodankyla {{have been}} {{operated}} {{according to the}} highest levels of the WMO/GAW (World Meteorological Organization/Global Atmosphere Watch) recommendations with rigorous quality control and quality assurance. The calibration of the instruments is based on annual recalibrations of primary <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> in the VTT MIKES Metrology National Standards Laboratory in Finland and an exhaustive measurement program with measurements of <b>standard</b> and working <b>lamps</b> in the on-site optical laboratories. Over the years, the maintenance of the calibration has produced data sets of approximately 2000 lamp scans for both instruments. An extensive re-examination of the lamp measurements and the response of the spectrophotometers was carried out. The primary <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> were found to age on an average rate of 0. 3 % per burn. The responsivity at wavelength 311 nm was found to exhibit both long-term and short-term changes. The overall long-term change was declining. In addition, abrupt changes of as large as 25 % were detected. The short-term changes were found to fluctuate on time frames shorter than the interval between the measurements of the primary <b>standard</b> <b>lamps.</b> This underlines the importance of the use of more frequently measured working <b>standard</b> <b>lamps...</b>|$|R

40|$|The last CCPR intercomparison in 1985 showed {{variations}} of #+-# 1 % in the units of luminous intensity (candela) and luminous flux (lumen) maintained by 14 and 10 participating laboratories, respectively. Meanwhile, the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) {{and some of}} the participating laboratories changed their units, as reported by BIPM. Therefore, VNIIOFI and PTB have an interest in the cooperation on important scientific work in photometry, and this also provides the framework for this bilateral intercomparison. Measurements were carried out at both laboratories to compare the values of luminous intensity, photometric responsivity and luminous flux assigned to artifacts. At VNIIOFI the primary standard of luminous intensity is a high-temperature blackbody. Its temperature is determined by help of a non-selective cavity radiometer. A (primary) photometer with a liquid V(#lambda#) -correcting filter transfers the unit to a group of luminous intensity <b>standard</b> <b>lamps,</b> which are used for the maintenance of the unit. At present, luminous intensity and illuminance calibrations at VNIIOFI are carried out as substitution method with groups of <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> and V(#lambda#) -corrected (silicon) photometers. The luminous flux calibrations are carried out by means of a group of luminous flux reference <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> and a 2 -meter integrating sphere. The value of luminous flux was established during bilateral comparisons with the BIPM, 1990 and the CSIRO (Australia, 1991). At PTB, the photometric base unit of luminous intensity is realised annually based on radiometric power measurements with absolute radiometers. The unit is maintained by groups of incandescent lamps. In any case, the maintained unit was within the uncertainty range of the realisations and no adjustments were carried out within the last decade. The luminous flux unit is derived fundamentally from the luminous intensity unit by goniophotometric methods and maintained by incandescent lamps. The magnitude of all photometric units have remained unchanged at PTB since the CCPR intercomparison in 1985. (orig.)

40|$|Background: Entamoeba histolytica, the causative {{agent for}} {{amoebiasis}} {{is a considerable}} burden to population in the developing countries where it accounts for over 50 million infections. The tools for detection of amoebiasis are inadequate and diagnosis relies on microscopy which means a significant percent of cases remain undiagnosed. Moreover, tests formats that can be rapidly applied in rural endemic areas are not available. Methods: In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal test (LAMP) based on 18 S small subunit ribosomal RNA gene was designed with extra reaction accelerating primers (stem primers) and compared with the published LAMP and PCR tests in detection of E. histolytica DNA in clinical samples. Results: The stem LAMP test indicated shorter time to results by an average 11 min and analytical sensitivity of 10 − 7 (30 pg/ml) compared to the <b>standard</b> <b>LAMP</b> and PCR which showed sensitivities levels of 10 − 5 (3 ng/ml) and 10 − 4 (30 ng/ml) respectively using tenfold serial dilution of DNA.

40|$|Abstract. Even though {{energy-efficient}} {{and sustainable}} solutions, such as {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs), have become popular in general lighting, mainly incandescent lamps are used as measurement standards in photometry. Optical properties of the LED lamps together with the often unstable built-in power converters bring challenges to NMIs and testing laboratories. Due to the narrow and complicated spectra of the LED lamps, the uncertainties of traditional photometers calibrated by incandescent lamps tend to increase when LED lamps are measured. Switching from an incandescent lamp to an LED-based calibration source would decrease the uncertainty related to the spectral mismatch correction. LED-based photometric <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> would also have other benefits, such as long lifetime and good temporal stability. Moreover, as spectra of white LED lamps are limited to the visible wavelength range, a novel method for illuminance measurements based on the Predictable Quantum Efficient Detector (PQED) {{can be used to}} characterize these <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> with luminous flux uncertainties significantly below 1 % (k = 2) at NMIs. The method eliminates the need of photometric filters in realization of the illuminance unit. Instead, the photometric weighting is carried out numerically using a separately measured relative spectrum of the source. Well characterized LED-based calibration lamps, together with improved electrical power measurement, would reduce measurement uncertainties of illuminance, luminous intensity, luminous flux and luminous efficacy measurements of LE...|$|R
40|$|The Absolute Integrating-Sphere Method was {{developed}} and introduced by NIST for {{the realization of the}} luminous flux unit using an integrating sphere rather than a goniophotometer. The total luminous flux of a lamp inside the sphere is calibrated against the known amount of flux introduced into the sphere from the external source through a calibrated aperture. The key element of this method is the correction for the spatial nonuniformity of the integrating sphere, which has been made possible by a technique using a scanning-beam source. This method is to be applied directly to routine calibration measurements of luminous flux. A new luminous flux calibration facility with a 2. 5 m integrating sphere has been recently completed at NIST and will allow the calibration of test lamps with no need for luminous flux <b>standard</b> <b>lamps.</b> Calibrations will be performed based on the illuminance measurement of the external source by standard photometers. This method makes the luminous flux calibration a detector-based procedure, thereby eliminating the uncertainties {{associated with the use of}} <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> while achieving lower uncertainties by shortening the calibration chain. The characteristics of the new integrating sphere obtained by computer simulation and measurements are reported.
