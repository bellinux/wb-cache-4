40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the design, implementation {{and analysis of}} a three phase (6. 6 kV, 50 Hz) capacitor bank controller unit. Power factor correction using capacitor banks reduces reactive power consumption which will lead to minimization of losses {{and at the same}} time increases the electrical system’s efficiency. Most of the industrial installations have large electrical loads which are inductive in nature, which results in a lagging power factor. Power factor is the value of a system that reflects how much power is being borrowed from the power company for the system. Many power companies regulate industrial power factors to make sure that they do not fall below a certain level and charge the customer more on their utility bills if the power factor falls below a certain level. Power factor correction serves to correct low power factors by reducing the phase difference between the current and voltage at the distribution point for a company. In case of rapidly varying and <b>scattered</b> <b>load</b> it becomes difficult to maintain a high power factor by manually switching on/off capacitors in proportion to variation of load. Current transformer is used to measure the load current for sampling purposes. The most common way to correct the power factor is to switch capacitor banks at the source to generate reactive power. This work is to make a system that will switch capacitor banks when the power factor drops below a certain point to avoid powe...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis has been to {{investigate}} the existence of out-of-plane vibration of jacket sub-structures for offshore wind turbines. This is done by making the program code JAC (Jacket Analysis Code), which is capable of solving dynamic problems in both time and frequency domain. The code is also able to do damage analysis {{as it has been}} a major goal to quantify the change in damage caused by the out-of-plane vibrations and to see how this is influenced by dierent parameters. It is shown that the out-of-plane vibrations are caused by rotation of the intersection node, between tower and jacket, exciting a global-for-aft and global side-side eigenmode of the jacket structure. The rotation of the intersection node is probably caused by the higher harmonic components of load from the rotor. The out-of-plane vibration gives a significant contribution to the damage at some parts of the structure. In particular this applies to the face of the jacket perpendicular to the main load direction. However for the analysis performed by the authors, the damage generated by the in-plane stresses is governing. The infjuence of marine growth, structural damping and incremental time step is investigated. It is shown how these parameters will have significant influence on the damage of the structure. The analysis is done using a sequential approach where calculations on wind turbine and sub-structure are separated. The thesis shows that this method could highly overestimate the response of out-of-plane vibrations if the structure is exposed to a widely <b>scattered</b> <b>load.</b> This is due to coupling of modes. </p...|$|E

Health monitoring remains a challenge to easily implement, especially in the presence of <b>scattered</b> <b>loading</b> conditions, crack size, component geometry, and materials properties. The current trend, however, is to utilize noninvasive types of health monitoring or nondestructive techniques to detect hidden flaws and mini-cracks before any catastrophic event occurs. These techniques go further to evaluate material discontinuities and other anomalies that have grown to the level of critical defects that can lead to failure.

40|$|Detecting {{rotating}} {{engine component}} malfunctions and structural anomalies is increasingly becoming a crucial key feature {{that will help}} boost safety and lower maintenance cost. However, achievement of such technology, which {{can be referred to}} as a health monitoring remains somewhat challenging to implement.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{non-destructive}} evaluation of structural components allows {{the detection of}} cracks {{and other types of}} flaws with a high resolution. When cracks are involved in mechanical failure events, fracture mechanics provides concepts for lifetime prediction of components when component geometry, material characteristics and load intensity under steady state or impact loading are known. Under fatigue loads additionally material laws have to be observed. Bringing together these disciplines, quantitative non-destructive testing for lifetime prediction is possible. Due to measurement uncertainties related to crack size geometry, material pa-rameters' inherent <b>scatter</b> and <b>load</b> history are not unambiguously assessable. Therefore, statistical distributions are assumed (e. g. Normal or Weibull) and probabilistic fitness for service assessment (FFS) is performed rather than a de-terministic one. This concept of combining quantitative non-destructive testing and probabilistic FFS assessment works well for metals. The fracture mechanics analysis under predominantly static loading has at its core the so called Failure Assessment Diagram (FAD). Hereby, an illustrative tool for condition monitoring is supplied which is also accepted in design rules and codes...|$|R

40|$|In {{reliability}} {{analyses of}} safety-relevant components {{it is necessary}} to consider the variations in load, geometry and material properties. The <b>scatter</b> in <b>load,</b> geometry and global material properties is nowadays addressed in some stochastic analyses [1, 2], whereas the scatter in local material properties is not adequately regarded due to difficulties in determining meaningful and stochastically relevant local material properties. In this paper a method for estimating the local distribution of the effective elastic behavior, belonging to a defined component direction, is presented. First, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analyses of relevant cross sections were performed. Second, the effective elastic behavior perpendicular to the cross section was calculated for each scan point from the determined Euler angles. By using direct tensor rotation and generalized Hooke’s law, the method can be applied to all kind of crystal structures if the elastic constants of the single crystal material are known. The experimental procedure, the mathematical background und the numerical realization are described in detail. Two examples of applying the procedure to materials for aerospace components as well as a stochastic finite element simulation considering the determined scatter of the elastic properties are shown...|$|R

Furthermore, today the robustness of the designs against naturally given input <b>scatter,</b> in <b>loading</b> conditions, geometry or material {{become part of the}} virtual product development process. Then, the prognosis of the variation of important simulation results using stochastic analysis procedure is necessary. Again the question arises how much of the calculated variation is coming from numerical noise.

Using coefficients of determination, a procedure of deselecting variation defined by correlation to physical input scatter and "undefined " variation is introduced. The breakthrough in practical application and the acceptance of stochastic analysis for robustness evaluations was achieved by using linear and quadratic correlations and the corresponding measures of determination as well as by projection of statistical measures on the finite element structure.
