5|$|India's large {{agricultural}} <b>subsidies</b> <b>are</b> hampering productivity-enhancing investment.|$|E
5|$|According to the government, {{approximately}} $100 {{billion per}} year is spent on subsidizing energy prices ($45 billion for the prices of fuel alone) and many consumable goods including bread, sugar, rice, cooking oil and medicine. However, some experts believe direct <b>subsidies</b> <b>are</b> about $30 billion, depending on oil prices.|$|E
5|$|Households {{with incomes}} between 100% and 400% {{of the federal}} poverty level were {{eligible}} to receive federal subsidies for policies purchased via an exchange. <b>Subsidies</b> <b>are</b> provided as an advanceable, refundable tax credits. Additionally, small businesses are eligible for a tax credit provided that they enroll in the SHOP Marketplace. Under the law, workers whose employers offer affordable coverage will not be eligible for subsidies via the exchanges. To be eligible the cost of employer-based health insurance must exceed 9.5% of the worker's household income.|$|E
30|$|A <b>subsidy</b> <b>was</b> not {{directly}} applied as a variable in this study. A <b>subsidy</b> <b>was</b> applied as a constant as mentioned below.|$|R
50|$|Capital <b>subsidies</b> <b>were</b> {{applicable}} to rooftop solar-power plants up {{to a maximum}} of 500 kW. The 30-percent <b>subsidy</b> <b>was</b> reduced to 15 percent.|$|R
30|$|As {{with any}} benefit system, wage <b>subsidies</b> must <b>be</b> {{accompanied}} by a rigorous monitoring system to prevent and/or detect fraud and abuse. The monitoring system must ensure both that each employee for whom the <b>subsidy</b> <b>is</b> claimed is not only eligible for the <b>subsidy</b> but <b>is</b> actually working, that the claimed wages are being paid, and that the data {{used to determine the}} amount of the <b>subsidy</b> <b>are</b> accurate. The principal tools available for compliance monitoring include documentation requirements; cross-checks against other government records; and in-person audits with employers or workers.|$|R
5|$|Just {{as there}} is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. <b>Subsidies</b> <b>are</b> not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.|$|E
5|$|With {{investment}} subsidies, {{the financial}} burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment <b>subsidies</b> <b>are</b> paid out {{as a function of}} the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as Austin Energy in Texas, which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.|$|E
5|$|The CSR <b>subsidies</b> <b>are</b> paid to {{insurance}} companies to reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of ACA enrollees, those earning less than 250% of the federal poverty line (FPL). The second and larger type of subsidy, the premium tax credits designed to reduce the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees earning less than 400% of the FPL. For scale, during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for the premium tax credits. A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide to appropriate funds for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, as Democrats with a minority in Congress could not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an appropriations bill.|$|E
30|$|The NPV of Salalah Farm without Government <b>subsidy</b> <b>is</b> 62 {{thousand}} rials {{increased to}} 915 thousand Rials with raw material subsidy program. For Hanfeet and Dawkah Farms NPV with Government capital <b>subsidy</b> <b>is</b> negative and record − 1.8 Million and − 3 Million Rials respectively. These results shows Farms under new water policy imposed by Government Authorities are highly exposed to underground water availability risk and raw material <b>subsidy</b> <b>are</b> required for three farms location to achieve sustainability (Table  5).|$|R
50|$|Press {{support is}} a Norwegian state subsidy {{available}} for newspapers. The <b>subsidy</b> <b>is</b> twofold; {{the first part}} <b>is</b> a direct <b>subsidy</b> of the second- largest, by circulation, newspapers in each city. The other <b>subsidy</b> <b>is</b> that newspaper are subject to no sales tax (as are books).|$|R
2500|$|In 2014, the [...] "direct payments" [...] {{portion of}} <b>subsidies</b> <b>was</b> abolished, and <b>subsidies</b> <b>were</b> mostly {{replaced}} with two programs. Farmers may pick [...] Price Loss Coverage (a {{guarantee that the}} farmer will get a certain price for their crop) and Agricultural Risk Coverage (which guarantees {{a certain amount of}} revenue).|$|R
25|$|Electricity <b>subsidies</b> <b>are</b> {{estimated}} to exceed US$ 1 billion in 2008, corresponding to a stunning 3% of GDP. The need for subsidies has increased due to {{higher oil prices}} while electricity tariffs have been kept constant. <b>Subsidies</b> <b>are</b> channeled through two major mechanisms: The Blackout Reduction Program and the Tariff Stabilization Fund.|$|E
25|$|Investment in new {{infrastructure}} and maintenance is financed {{through the state}} budget, and <b>subsidies</b> <b>are</b> provided for passenger train operations. NSB operates long-haul trains, including night trains, regional services and four commuter train systems, around Oslo, Trondheim, Bergen and Stavanger.|$|E
25|$|Concerning sanitation, unequalized tariffs {{are by far}} {{the highest}} in Germany at 111 euro per year. Equalized costs net of <b>subsidies</b> <b>are,</b> however, highest in England and Wales with 138 euro, {{followed}} by France (122 euro), Germany (119 euro) and Italy (85 euro).|$|E
50|$|The {{premium rates}} vary from 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent of sum assured for food crops. In {{the case of}} horticultural and {{commercial}} crops, actuarial rates are charged. Small and marginal farmers {{are entitled to a}} subsidy of 50 percent of the premium charged- the <b>subsidy</b> <b>is</b> shared equally between the Government of India and the States. The <b>subsidy</b> <b>is</b> to be phased out over a period of 5 years.|$|R
50|$|Conversely broad {{subsidies}} {{include both}} monetary and non-monetary <b>subsidies</b> and <b>is</b> {{often difficult to}} identify. A broad <b>subsidy</b> <b>is</b> less attributable and less transparent. Environmental externalities {{are the most common}} type of broad subsidy.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, Steinbrück and Roland Koch, the Christian Democrat premier of Hesse, {{together}} {{drew up a}} plan {{to reduce}} tax breaks and subsidies, including those on coal. The <b>subsidies</b> <b>were</b> a particularly sensitive issue in North Rhine-Westphalia, {{where most of the}} coal mines were located then. Nevertheless, Steinbrück and Koch agreed that all <b>subsidies</b> <b>were</b> to be reduced by 12 percent over several years. Steinbrück was a supporter of the so-called [...] "Agenda 2010".|$|R
25|$|<b>Subsidies</b> <b>are</b> {{also given}} to provide diesel for power {{production}} in non-grid-connected zones. While diesel {{in the interior}} of the country can cost in the order of US$0.8/gal, in remote areas it can cost in the order of US$4.5/gal because of high transport costs.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{there has}} been {{significant}} governmental intervention in wheat markets, such as price supports in the US and farm payments in the EU. In the EU, these subsidies have encouraged heavy use of fertilizer inputs with resulting high crop yields. In Australia and Argentina, direct government <b>subsidies</b> <b>are</b> much lower.|$|E
25|$|To this day, {{there remain}} vast {{differences}} between the former East Germany and West Germany (for example, in lifestyle, wealth, political beliefs, and other matters) and thus it is still common to speak of eastern and western Germany distinctly. The eastern German economy has struggled since unification, and large <b>subsidies</b> <b>are</b> still transferred from west to east.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, the <b>subsidies</b> <b>were</b> reduced, {{resulting}} in a 60 euro-cents fare per ride.|$|R
5000|$|The {{proportion}} of merit <b>subsidies</b> <b>is</b> much higher in social services vis-à-vis economic services.|$|R
50|$|As an interprovincial ferry service, {{the route}} qualifies {{for a federal}} <b>subsidy</b> which <b>is</b> {{provided}} to NFL to offset losses in return for operating the vessels and terminals. This <b>subsidy</b> <b>was</b> fully renewed for 5 years in March 2005.|$|R
25|$|Agricultural <b>subsidies</b> <b>are</b> paid {{to farmers}} and agribusinesses to {{supplement}} their income, manage the supply of their commodities and influence the cost and supply of those commodities. In the United States, the main crops the government subsidizes contribute to the obesity problem; since 1995, $300 billion have gone to crops {{that are used to}} create junk food.|$|E
25|$|Investments are financed through bonds issued {{directly}} by the municipalities or utility bonds that are backed by municipalities; utilities' own resources; subsidies from the national government (e.g. grants of at least 50% for sanitation); and subsidies from municipalities. Investment <b>subsidies</b> <b>are</b> common for sanitation and uncommon for water supply. Private financing remains the exception.|$|E
25|$|Municipalities receive {{grants and}} soft loans {{in order to}} finance investments, {{particularly}} in wastewater treatment. These <b>subsidies</b> <b>are</b> channeled through various funds, such as the Water Networks Rehabilitation Fund, the National Sewage Program and the Wastewater Renovation and Reuse Program. The State invests about NIS 450 million per year (about US$125 million) in sanitation through these funds, mostly {{in the form of}} long term subsidized loans (20 years, 5% interest), and some in the form of grants.|$|E
25|$|In 2014 and 2015, the Croatian {{government}} initiated purchase incentives. The <b>subsidies</b> <b>were</b> discontinued in 2016.|$|R
50|$|It was {{sponsored}} by Sen. Wesley L. Jones (R) of Washington and Sen. Wallace H. White (R) of Maine. It did not repeal the La Follette Seamen's Act of 1915, but instead created Federal export subsidies to big shipping firms. The <b>subsidies</b> <b>were</b> purported to offset the cost of having to pay seamen higher wages under the earlier act; however, the <b>subsidies</b> <b>were</b> larger than wage differences.|$|R
50|$|Queensland used {{to provide}} an 8.354c/L subsidy on most fuels sold in the state, {{including}} on unleaded, blended unleaded, LPG and ethanol. The subsidy reflected the lower franchise fee Queensland charged compared to other states prior to 1997. This was usually reflected by an 8.354c/L price difference at the pump, as the <b>subsidy</b> <b>was</b> paid directly to retailers. The <b>subsidy</b> <b>was</b> removed from 1 July 2009.|$|R
25|$|Overview Many {{urban water}} and {{wastewater}} utilities in China experience financial stress, because user fees are set well below cost recovery levels and government <b>subsidies</b> <b>are</b> insufficient to cover the resulting gap. In 2004, 60% of urban water utilities reported negative net incomes. The financial situation of wastewater utilities {{is expected to be}} even more precarious. Tariffs have increased by 50% since 1998 and now stand at 1.5 RMB/m3 or US$0.20/m3. These rates are insufficient to cover costs.|$|E
25|$|Buy-back centers {{differ in}} that the cleaned recyclates are purchased, thus {{providing}} a clear incentive for use and creating a stable supply. The post-processed material can then be sold. If this is profitable, this conserves the emission of greenhouse gases; if unprofitable, it increases the emission of greenhouse gasses. Government <b>subsidies</b> <b>are</b> necessary to make buy-back centres a viable enterprise. In 1993, according to the U.S. National Waste & Recycling Association, it costs on average US$50 to process a ton of material, which can be resold for US$30.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{into account}} {{differences}} in subsidies and service quality, {{the cost of}} supplying water at an equalised service level would be 84 euros in Germany, 106 euro in both France and England/Wales, and 74 euro in Italy. Concerning sanitation, unequalised tariffs are the highest in Germany at 111 euro per year, 93 euro in England and Wales, €90 in France and only €40 in Italy. Equalised costs net of <b>subsidies</b> <b>are,</b> however, highest in England and Wales with €138, followed by France (€122), Germany (119 euro) and Italy (85 euro).|$|E
3000|$|... = 29.8 {{thousand}} euros). The covered wage {{applied to}} workers receiving the unemployment <b>subsidy</b> <b>is</b> 6, 200 euros.|$|R
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of the {{domestic}} country, the <b>subsidy</b> <b>is</b> welfare improving. The 20 million <b>subsidy</b> <b>is</b> a transfer from the government to the firm hence it has no effect on national welfare (ignoring costs of taxation; as long as these are not too large the basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|R
