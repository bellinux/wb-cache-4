40|$|ABSTRACT. Op Site {{dressings}} {{for total}} parenteral nutrition catheters on one general surgical ward {{were compared with}} the immediate prior experience with conventional occlusive gauze dressings on the same ward. Twenty-one patients were followed for 319 patient days using Op Site and 11 patients (196 patient days) with gauze dressings. The infectious complication rate remained acceptably low (less than one infection/ 100 patient days). Savings in nursing time used for total parenteral nutrition catheter care occurred with Op Site (10 minutes versus 30 minutes per patient). This resulted in a savings of $ 25 per average patient, despite the slight additional cost of a <b>single</b> <b>dressing.</b> The general surgical nursing unit at Harborview Med-ical Center manages an average of five hyperalimentation catheters per day.

These power-corrections can be analyzed in perturbative QCD using renormalon resummation in the <b>single</b> <b>dressed</b> gluon approximation. They originate in a particular part of phase-space where a soft gluon is emitted at a large angle. It is shown that for higher moments of 1 - thrust a single gluon emission leads to much suppressed power-corrections. In particular, the corrections to from soft gluon emission fall as 1 /Q^ 3. Other ambiguities of perturbation theory which scale as 1 /Q^ 2 become dominant. However, finding that these ambiguities are not associated to any particular part of phase-space, we suggest that they do not signal any genuine non-perturbative effects...|$|R

Very recently, the NIST group has also announced in a DARPA Meeting the creation of non-abelian gauge fields in a pseudo spin- 1 / 2 Bose gas. While there have been considerable theoretical activities in synthetic gauge fields, non-abelian fields have not been generated until now. Here, we show that in a non-abelian gauge field, a spinor condensate will develop a spontaneous stripe structure in each spin component, reflecting a ground state made up of two non-orthogonal dressed states with different momenta.

40|$|Perturbative and non-perturbative {{aspects of}} {{differential}} cross-sections {{close to a}} kinematic threshold are studied applying ``dressed gluon exponentiation'' (DGE). The factorization property of soft and collinear gluon radiation is demonstrated using the light-cone axial gauge: it is shown that the singular part of the squared matrix element for the emission of an off-shell gluon off a nearly on-shell quark is universal. We derive a generalized splitting function that describes the emission probability and show how Sudakov logs emerge from the phase-space boundary where the gluon transverse momentum vanishes. Both soft and collinear logs associated with a <b>single</b> <b>dressed</b> gluon are computed through a single integral over the running-coupling to any logarithmic accuracy. The result then serves as the kernel for exponentiation. The divergence of the perturbative series in the exponent indicates specific non-perturbative corrections. We identify two classes of observables according to whether the radiation is from an initial-state quark, as in the Drell-Yan process, or a final-state quark, forming a jet with a constrained invariant mass, as in fragmentation functions, event-shape variables and deep inelastic structure functions.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of an atomic few-level system {{can depend on}} the phase of driving fields coupled to the atom if certain conditions are satisfied. This {{is of particular interest}} to control interference effects, which can alter the system properties considerably. In this article, we discuss the mechanisms of such phase control and interference effects in an atomic three-level system in the ? configuration, where the upper state spontaneously decays into the two lower states. The lower states are coupled by a driving field, which we treat as quantized. This allows for an interpretation on the single photon level for both the vacuum and the driving field. By analysing the system behaviour for a driving field initially in non-classical states with only a few Fock number states populated, we find that even though the driving field is coupled to the lower states only, it induces a multiplet of upper states. Then interference occurs independently in three-level subsystems in the V configuration, each formed by two adjacent upper states and a <b>single</b> <b>dressed</b> lower state...|$|R

40|$|The {{solution}} of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation of the molecule + radiation field system is analyzed. A quantized radiation field is used. The relationship between the oscillatory wave function and the dressed state wave function is established, the oscillatory wave function being the solution if the radiation field is turned on at t = 0 and the dressed state being the stationary solution satisfying the boundary condition only if the field is present at t = negative infinity. In general, the oscillatory wave function can be expressed using {{a complete set of}} dressed states. However, {{in the presence of a}} nonresonant radiation field, the system is well represented by a <b>single</b> <b>dressed</b> state. Molecular properties such as dynamic polarizabilities and two-photon transition moments can be deduced from the dressed state wave function instead of the oscillatory wave function as in previous methods.

40|$|Resummation and power-corrections play {{a crucial}} role in the {{phenomenology}} of event-shape variables like the thrust T. Previous investigations showed that the perturbative contribution to the average thrust is dominated by gluons of small invariant mass, of the order of 10 % of Q, where Q is the center-of-mass energy. The effect of soft gluons is also important, leading to a non-perturbative 1 /Q correction. These conclusions are based on renormalon analysis in the <b>single</b> <b>dressed</b> gluon (SDG) approximation. Here we analyze higher moments of the thrust distribution using a similar technique. We find that the characteristic gluon invariant mass contributing to increases with m. Yet, for m= 2 this scale is quite low, around 27 % of Q, and therefore renormalon resummation is still very important. On the other hand, the power-correction to from a single soft gluon emission is found to be highly suppressed: it scales as 1 /Q^ 3. In practice, and higher moments depend also on soft gluon emission from configurations of three hard partons, which may lead to alpha_s(Q^ 2) /Q power-corrections.
