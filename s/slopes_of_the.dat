5|$|The {{climate of}} the Itcha Range is {{influenced}} by the presence of the Coast Mountains to the west, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Coast Mountains before reaching the Interior Plateau, casting a rain shadow over the Itcha Range.|$|E

5|$|The terrain in the Trout Creek Mountains {{varies from}} broad, flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock escarpments cut by deep canyons. The canyons have steep walls with loose talus slopes at the bottoms. There are meadows around springs in the mountains, {{although}} most streams {{in the range}} do not flow year-round. Major streams that flow off the north <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains include (from west to east) Cottonwood Creek, Trout Creek, Willow Creek, and Whitehorse Creek. These streams all flow into endorheic basins in Harney County, Oregon. Trout Creek and Whitehorse Creek are {{the largest of the}} four. The Kings River and McDermitt Creek each drain an area on the south <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trout Creek Mountains. The Kings River begins in The Granites and flows south into Nevada, where it meets the Quinn River, which evaporates in the Black Rock Desert. McDermitt Creek begins in Oregon a few miles north of The Granites and flows generally east, crossing the Oregon–Nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the Quinn River Valley south of McDermitt.|$|E
