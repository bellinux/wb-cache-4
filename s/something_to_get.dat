500|$|Hardcore Gamer Edward Dang was {{positive}} to the game, {{and hoped that}} {{it would lead to}} virtual reality releases of complete Danganronpa games. Jordan Devore at Destructoid thought that the game did not look exciting based on off-screen footage, but noted that this often is the case for virtual reality games, and thought that it [...] "could be the start of something neat". Chris Carter, also writing for Destructoid, enjoyed the game and called it worth playing, but not <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> excited over due to its short length. Aki Otsuki at 4Gamer.net recommended the game, and said that experiencing the punishment sequence in virtual reality was horrifying. Famitsu liked the immersion given by the virtual reality and the 360-degree movements. Hiroaki Mabuchi at IGN Japan said that the new environment graphics were a great reproduction of their Trigger Happy Havoc counterparts, and that the mysterious atmosphere suited Danganronpa well.|$|E
500|$|From 1951 to 1952, he toured Ireland {{with the}} Anew McMaster {{repertory}} company, playing {{over a dozen}} roles. In 1952, he began acting in regional English repertory productions; from 1953 to 1954, {{he worked for the}} Donald Wolfit Company, at the King's Theatre, Hammersmith, performing eight roles. From 1954 until 1959, Pinter acted under the stage name David Baron. In all, Pinter played over 20 roles under that name. [...] To supplement his income from acting, Pinter worked as a waiter, a postman, a bouncer, and a snow-clearer, meanwhile, according to Mark Batty, [...] "harbouring ambitions as a poet and writer." [...] In October 1989 Pinter recalled: [...] "I was in English rep as an actor for about 12 years. My favourite roles were undoubtedly the sinister ones. [...] They're <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> your teeth into." [...] During that period, he also performed occasional roles in his own and others' works for radio, TV, and film, as he continued to do throughout his career.|$|E
500|$|Graphically, Wave Race 64 {{was praised}} for its fluid animations, {{realistic}} physics, clean waters, and textured polygons. IGN's Doug Perry commented, [...] "The {{way in which}} jetskis cut into the ocean's surface, lift off ramps, bounce into and off oncoming waves, or slide on icy surfaces is not only believable and engaging, but simply unparalleled." [...] Writing for The Electric Playground, Victor Lucas highlighted the game's distinct environments, saying that each course offers players <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> excited about. He also gave high marks to the game's satisfying sound effects, particularly when players submerge under the waves, but described the music as [...] "undeniably shallow". GamePro agreed, describing the music as juvenile and the announcer's voice as irritating. In contrast, AllGame's Jonti Davies felt that the game's [...] "cheesy" [...] and [...] "distinctly '80s theme" [...] soundtrack combined with the announcer's [...] "hyperexcited cries" [...] gives the game a light and arcade feel.|$|E

500|$|Along with Klingon cosmetics, makeup {{supervisor}} Michael J. Mills {{was kept}} busy preparing {{the large number}} of other aliens called for in the script. Mills and his team created the largest makeup endeavor ever seen in a Star Trek film until then; custom makeup was applied to 22 principal actors, and as many as 126 prosthetic makeups each day. Because the alien creatures played such {{an important role in the}} film, there was a concerted push to provide enough money to the makeup department to make sure the complex work was finished. According to Mills, [...] " [...] we could prove to [...] that we needed <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the shot done, then we'd have it." [...] The makeup lab employed a staff of 25 and produced over 300 prosthetics, from Klingon foreheads to Vulcan and Romulan ears. Work on the many extras began as early as one o'clock in the morning to be ready for the eight o'clock call.|$|E
500|$|Spending {{their own}} money, N.E.R.D {{recorded}} the album at the South Beach Studios in Miami, Florida, and the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles, California. Williams used a Triton Extreme, Triton Pro and Pro Tools {{in the production}} of the album, while Hugo worked in Access Virus TI, Roland JV-1080, JV-2080, XV-5080, TR-808 and TR-909 as beatboxing was provided by Haley. Rock band Spymob further assisted production with guitar and drums. Production revolved around heavy rock, funk and soul music, which was first introduced in their debut album, In Search Of.... Hugo described the album as going back to the band's roots, combining a classic rock sound with a 1970s funk swing. The typical process of recording was described as [...] "Williams arrives at the studio, ideas in full flower, and lays down both a beat (either programmed or played on an assortment of buckets) and vocals." [...] Hugo then would add extra instrumentation. In an interview with MTV, Williams said that the band [...] "didn't care about genres; we're not doing this for the money. We're doing this for people who pledge allegiance to our movement." [...] Hugo {{went on to say that}} they [...] "just want to make people move". On the album he said, [...] "We had anger, quiet angst. We had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off our chest. And we wanted to show we could do it as a band." [...] Don Was, a musician and record producer, thought that the band was on a creatively fulfilling path, calling their musical style [...] "really innovative".|$|E

2500|$|The stadium has had {{repeated}} {{problems with}} the grass surface, including the grass collapsing under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker during a week 6 game in 2015. This has led to concern that the stadium wasn't of a high enough caliber to host a high stakes game such as the Super Bowl. The {{problems with the}} turf were mentioned {{the day after the}} Super Bowl by Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib who said [...] "The footing on the field was terrible. San Fran (the 49ers) has to play eight games on that field, so they better do <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it fixed. It was terrible." ...|$|E

[...] When Buzz Cason asked Lamar Fike [...] "how Elvis did it – this partying nearly every night," [...] he [...] "answered, 'A little somethin' to get down and a little <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up.'

2500|$|In {{the first}} women's semi-final match, fifth seeded Russian Maria Sharapova {{defeated}} third seeded Serbian Jelena Janković in a two sets, 6–3, 6–1 to clinch the first {{spot in the}} finals. Janković later conceded that she [...] "wanted to withdraw", but played on for the crowd's benefit. Fourth seeded Ana Ivanovic also progressed to the final after defeating Daniela Hantuchová in three sets, 0–6, 6–3, 6–4. Ivanovic had lost the first eight games of the match before rectifying her game. However, Hantuchová was critical of Ivanovic's tactics during the latter stages of the match. Hantuchová claimed that Ivanovic resorted to gamesmanship by shuffling her feet prior to her serve, thereby causing a distraction. Ivanovic said that any possible noise {{was a result of}} the new court surface; and tried to offer an explanation of Hantuchová's motives, saying, [...] "Maybe she was just trying to pick on <b>something,</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> upset." [...] Unseeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga defeated second seeded Spaniard Rafael Nadal in the first men's semifinal, in straight sets, 6–2, 6–3, 6–2 in less than 2 hours. Journalists expressed shock, not only at the victory, but at the comprehensive manner in which the nascent Tsonga won it. Tsonga hit a total of 49 winners to Nadal's 13 and served imperiously: Nadal was unable to force a break point until the third set.|$|E
2500|$|Tsarnaev was {{the subject}} of a cover story for an August 2013 issue of Rolling Stone {{entitled}} [...] "The Bomber: How a Popular, Promising Student Was Failed by His Family, Fell into Radical Islam and Became a Monster." [...] The magazine drew large amounts of criticism for the flattering photo of Tsarnaev used for the issue's cover. Boston Mayor Tom Menino wrote that the cover [...] "rewards a terrorist with celebrity treatment". Massachusetts State Police sergeant Sean Murphy stated that [...] "glamorizing the face of terror is not just insulting to the family members of those killed in the line of duty, it also could be an incentive to those who may be unstable to do <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their face on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine." [...] The New York Times used the same photo on their front page in May 2013, but did not draw criticism. Rolling Stone columnist Matt Taibbi criticized those who took offense at the cover, arguing that their offense-taking was the result of their associating Rolling Stone with glamor instead of news, stating that The New York Times did not draw the criticism that Rolling Stone did, [...] "because everyone knows the Times is a news organization. Not everyone knows that about Rolling Stone... because many people out there understandably do not know that Rolling Stone is also a hard-news publication." ...|$|E
