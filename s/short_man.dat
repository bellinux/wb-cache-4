5|$|During 2006, MacFarlane {{had a role}} in the {{independent}} film Life is Short. He portrayed Dr. Ned, a psychologist who advises a <b>short</b> <b>man</b> (played by Freaks and Geeks star Samm Levine) to have relationships with taller women. He is a frequent guest on the radio talkshow Loveline, hosted by Dr. Drew Pinsky.|$|E
5|$|No {{images of}} Murrell survive. Accounts {{describe}} him as a <b>short</b> <b>man</b> who walked with {{his hands behind his}} back and hummed as he went. He was also noted for wearing a hard hat, bobbed tale coat, and iron goggles, while carrying a whalebone umbrella and a basket into which he placed the herbs that he collected. His appearance reportedly scared local children, of whom he was nevertheless fond.|$|E

40|$|Male {{height is}} {{associated}} with high mate value. In particular, tall men are perceived as more attractive, dominant and of a higher status than shorter rivals, resulting in a greater lifetime reproductive success. Female infidelity and relationship dissolution may therefore present a greater risk to <b>short</b> <b>men.</b> It was predicted that tall men would report greater relationship satisfaction and lower jealousy and mate retention behavior than <b>short</b> <b>men.</b> Ninety eight heterosexual men in a current romantic relationship completed a questionnaire. Both linear and quadratic relationships were found between male height and relationship satisfaction, cognitive and behavioral jealousy. Tall men reported greater relationship satisfaction {{and lower levels of}} cognitive or behavioral jealousy than <b>short</b> <b>men.</b> In addition, linear and quadratic relationships were found between male height and a number of mate retention behaviors. Tall and <b>short</b> <b>men</b> engaged in different mate retention behaviors. These findings are consistent with previous research conducted in this area detailing the greater attractiveness of tall men...|$|R
5|$|At {{the height}} of the Pig-faced Lady mania of 1814–15, it was rumoured that Sholto Henry Maclellan, 9th Lord Kirkcudbright had made {{enquiries}} about the whereabouts of the Pig-faced Lady of Manchester Square, possibly with a view to becoming one of her suitors. Waltzing a Courtship, an anonymous drawing, was widely circulated in various publications. It shows an elegantly dressed Pig-faced Lady dancing with a hunchbacked and extremely <b>short</b> <b>man</b> bearing a strong resemblance to Kirkcudbright.|$|E
5|$|Controversy arose {{regarding}} the artwork {{for the cover}} for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on video when close examination of the artwork revealed an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a human penis. Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear {{on the cover of}} the second releasing of the movie. A second allegation is that a clergyman is seen with an erection during a scene late in the film. The clergyman is a <b>short</b> <b>man,</b> dressed in Bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.|$|E

40|$|<b>Short</b> <b>men</b> {{are less}} likely to be married or live in a {{permanent}} relationship than their taller counterparts. This pattern is not due to their social status. While blue-collar workers are shorter on average than managers, the effects of height on finding a mate are similar in the two social groups. Being tall is also economically advantageous for men. With identical educational attainment levels, tall men have better careers than <b>short</b> <b>men</b> as they are given greater supervisory responsibilities. In making a commitment, some women might take height into account as an anticipated indicator of future resources of the household. Choice of partner is also influenced by social norms – i. e., partners should be physically well-matched – which is more difficult for <b>shorter</b> <b>men...</b>|$|R

25|$|Briggs was a notably <b>short</b> <b>man</b> {{at about}} five feet five or 165 centimetres. Briggs's skill lay {{in his ability to}} vary the flight and pace of the ball as well as in {{achieving}} prodigious spin on the primitive pitches of the nineteenth century. As a batsman, Briggs was capable of hitting very effectively, but as time went by an eagerness to punish every ball set in and led to a decline.|$|E
500|$|McCay {{married in}} 1891, and the {{marriage}} was not a happy one. [...] According to McCay biographer John Canemaker, McCay depicts marriage in Rarebit Fiend as [...] "a minefield of hypocrisy, jealousy, and misunderstanding". [...] McCay was a <b>short</b> <b>man,</b> barely five feet (...) tall. [...] He was dominated by his wife, who stood as tall as he was. [...] Images of small, shy men dominated by their taller or fatter wives appear frequently in Rarebit Fiend. [...] Gigantism, with characters overwhelmed by rapidly growing elements, was another recurring motif, perhaps as compensation on McCay's part {{for a sense of}} smallness. [...] McCay's brother Arthur had been put in a mental asylum, which may have inspired the themes of insanity that are common in the strip.|$|E

Additionally, increased height showed a relationship with increased mean intellectual performance and, under conditions of stress, <b>shorter</b> <b>men</b> showcased demonstrably worse leadership capability and psychological function.|$|R

500|$|Marchant first {{teamed up}} with Ian Browne {{at the start of}} 1956, just ten months {{before the start of the}} Melbourne Olympics.

Marchant was a <b>short</b> <b>man</b> of [...] and , while Browne stood at [...] and , unusually tall for a cyclist. For a final test run before the pair formally committed to racing together, the pair simply had a few tandem sprints around the track. Browne sat in the front seat, while Marchant sat in the rear seat. The pair went on to win the 2000m tandem event at the Australian Championships in 1956, but going into the Melbourne Olympics, nobody, themselves included, regarded them as realistic medal chances. However, their mentor, former champion Billy Guyatt convinced them that they had the potential to make progress at international level.|$|E
500|$|Browne had {{his first}} success at a major {{competition}} {{when he won the}} 10mile at his first Australian Championships in 1953.

Marchant had risen to prominence by winning the 500m time trial at the 1955 Australian Championships for juniors, prompting Browne to select him as his partner based on his raw speed. For a final test run before formally committing to racing together, the pair simply had a few tandem sprints around the track, with Browne sitting in the front seat.

500|$|Macartney was a <b>short</b> <b>man,</b> {{standing}} 160cm (5" [...] 3). When batting, {{he would}} unconventionally attempt to leg glance yorkers pitched on middle stump down to fine-leg, and often lost his wicket in so doing. He {{was known for}} preferring his team-mates to give him candid criticism rather than praise. In later life he condemned modern batsmen; he would explain why he no longer watched cricket by saying [...] "I can't bear watching luscious half-volleys being nudged gently back to bowlers". Sir Neville Cardus wrote that [...] "there was always chivalry in his cricket, a prancing sort of heroism. The dauntlessness of his play, the brave beauty and the original skill bring {{tears to my eyes}} yet." [...] In the late 1940s, Macartney received a letter from a compiler of Who's Who in Australia, seeking information on his life. Macartney said that he had [...] "no record of figures, nor am I concerned with them. My only interest is {{the manner in which the}} runs are compiled and how wickets are taken, and in the good of the game." [...] "Those sentiments", wrote former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton, [...] "summed up the cricket story of C. G. Macartney".|$|E

500|$|Harvey was {{regarded}} as a mercurial batsman of great artistry and style. A <b>short</b> <b>man</b> at 172cm (5ft;8in), he batted with aggression, and was known for his timing of the ball. His batting against spin bowling in particular was a crowd pleaser, highlighted by his extravagant footwork in charging the bowlers. Harvey often charged five paces down the pitch to spinners, with one bowler quipping [...] "He kept coming so far along the track toward me that I thought he must want to shake my hands". Despite running out of the crease so much, Harvey was never stumped in a Test match. He was of the time belief that any bowling could and should be hit, and gave the impression that the balls were reaching the boundary with a minimum of power. According to Johnnie Moyes, [...] "the sight of his slim figure, neat and trim-looking, always capless, coming to bat brought new hope for spectators. He will never prod a half volley or decline the challenge of a long hop...he will go looking for the ball which he can hit for four." [...] Following the retirement of Sir Donald Bradman, he was seen as Australia's leading batsman, noted by critics for a similar ability to change the mood of matches with his attacking play. Ashley Mallett said that Harvey is Australia's best batsman since Bradman. This was {{despite the fact that he}} was found to have faulty eyesight. With the global expansion of cricket, Harvey was the first Australian to make Test centuries in 15 different cities, succeeding in a variety of conditions. Harvey made 67 first-class centuries spread across 35 venues in six countries. He scored 38 of these overseas, where his average was higher. He was the first batsman to score more than 10,000 runs for Australian teams at home and abroad.|$|E
