25|$|In 1994, Reno tasked the Justice Department with {{compiling}} {{a report on}} DNA exoneration. The science was still new {{at that point in}} time. Reno commissioned the report after reading about the exoneration of a death row inmate. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how many cases existed like the one she read about and what the Department of Justice could learn from it. The resulting report concluded there was a strong possibility that many more wrongful convictions which could be cleared with DNA evidence existed. Reno changed policies on how to interview eye witnesses and laboratory protocols in response.|$|E
25|$|Curtiss quickly {{recognized}} Genie's nonverbal communication abilities, recalling several nonverbal interactions Genie {{had with}} strangers during that time. By this time Genie could name {{most of the}} things around her and had an estimated vocabulary of at least a few hundred words, consisting of a few verbs and adjectives and a large number of nouns. She was also extremely eager to expand her vocabulary, frequently grabbing Curtiss' hand and pointing it towards objects for which <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the word, and if Curtiss could not figure out exactly what Genie was looking for Genie refused to let go until she learned at least one new word. Curtiss noted Genie's focus on objective properties, and especially her knowledge of color words, was very unusual because these require a level of cognitive sophistication not present in young children, suggesting she developed mental mechanisms for categorization during childhood. She had also clearly learned some basic principles of grammar, and understood more than she was producing.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} was negatively received by Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture and Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail. In May 2009, Deller placed Charlie at number five on her list of worst soap opera characters segment. Deller said, [...] "The Summer Bay cop may {{have lots of}} storylines, but the LC community don't really approve – mainly due to Esther Anderson's apparent lack of acting chops. It's like our hatred for Michelle Connor (Coronation Street) all over again, only this time with added scandalous-headline-grabbing-faux-lesbianity!" [...] In July 2009, Deller said, [...] "It {{would be easy to}} spend every month slagging off Charlie, because there's so much to dislike". Deller also added that Charlie's daughter is [...] "everything Charlie isn't". Stephen wondered if Charlie is going through an early menopause as she always appears [...] "to be in a sweat onscreen." [...] During a storyline, which saw Charlie decide she needs a counsellor to find her self-identity, Stephen complained that it was all she seemed to mention since her [...] "foray into lesbianism." [...] Stephen did, however, agree that Charlie needed a counsellor. She also stated she could help by telling her; [...] "Charlie: you're a mess." [...] Stephen was critical of Charlie's relationship with Angelo, which she described as a [...] "rocky road". <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how much the show could [...] "wring out of their on/off romance" [...] and asked if somebody could send them out to sea in a sinking boat. Following Charlie and Angelo's 2011 break up, Stephen stated that the show needs to [...] "change the record!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{test was}} {{featured}} on {{an episode of}} The Today Show in June 2005. In that show, Katie Couric interviewed a woman named Holly Osburn who was mother to two daughters and expecting. Osborn said that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the gender {{because she wanted to}} paint the nursery blue. Sherry Bonelli, the CEO of PregnancyStore.com was also interviewed and said that the test had only been available for two weeks and that numerous people had inquired about it in a short time.

On the show the results of Osborn's test revealed that was going to have another girl.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Hill {{was given}} a best-case {{prognosis}} of two years to live. Her father recalled that immediately after the diagnosis, [...] "I got weak, [...] Lisa got sick, and typical Lauren <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if she could still play basketball." [...] She indeed continued to play in her senior season at Lawrenceburg High despite undergoing regular chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and as scheduled came to MSJ for the 2014–15 season.

2500|$|Zamora and his six castmates ( [...] , Rachel Campos, Pam Ling, , David [...] "Puck" [...] Rainey, and Judd Winick) {{moved into}} the house at 953 Lombard Street on Russian Hill on February 12, 1994. While the {{producers}} informed the other six housemates {{that they would be}} living with someone HIV-positive, they did not tell them who it was. The first to meet Zamora was Cory Murphy, who traveled to the house with Zamora. During their trip, he told her he had AIDS. Zamora quickly bonded with his housemates. Zamora informed his roommate, Judd Winick, that he was the one with AIDS by telling him he was an AIDS educator, {{and the rest of the}} cast by showing them a scrapbook of his career as an AIDS educator. Another castmate, Rachel Campos, became uncomfortable with this, and initially distanced herself from Zamora, stating that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how this would affect her, but said nothing for fear of seeming intolerant. Zamora took this as an act of rejection on her part, though the two later formed a rapport in the second episode, in which Zamora addressed her concerns about his condition by educating her about HIV and AIDS. Nonetheless, Zamora later took offense at jokes about homosexuals that Rachel engaged in with David [...] "Puck" [...] Rainey.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the reports}} that Alfie would {{discover}} the affair, {{it was reported that}} several different storyline endings had been filmed, but that Wallace had been told the identity of Kat's lover, with a show source saying: [...] "The time felt right to finally tell Jessie, but she is still {{one of only a handful}} of people who knows the answer to the question on everyone's lips. [...] Lorraine [...] was adamant this story was going to stay quiet for as long as possible. She has done everything in her power to let it play out on screen with total secrecy behind the scenes. It's created a real buzz as everyone's been trying to figure out who Kat's been bedding. Up until now, none of the cast were in the know, not even her on-screen lover. It really has been that cloak and dagger. Richie revealed that Wallace had found not knowing the identity of Kat's lover [...] "frustrating" [...] but that she was [...] "torn between whether <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> or not, because if she had known, she was frightened she might give it away by just a look", while Richie himself was happy not to know, [...] "because Alfie was in the same position", adding that both actors were [...] "happy to let it play out, though, because Kat flirts outrageously with all three Branning brothers, so we wanted the audience to make up their own minds about who the mystery lover was." ...|$|E
