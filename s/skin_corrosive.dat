40|$|The Objectives of the {{research}} is to study the possible application of international recommendations made by the (GHS) to classify the chemicals in Giad Industrial City, in addition to design an appropriate easy understandable labels, prepare complete materials safety data sheets (MSDSs), {{as well as providing}} data for those selected substances to start a pilot safety system serving as a nucleus for the preparation of a complete safety system in Giad Industrial City. The methodology followed by the study starts by identifying those chemicals normally utilized in Giad factories, review their available (MSDS) and selecting those which serve as reference materials for the study. The procedure include the extraction of classification requirements as stipulated in the (GHS), collecting data on the selected materials from a qualified and relevant sources and then applying the (GHS) classification criteria for each material. The results of the classification revealed the existence of different hazard levels including one carcinogenic, six toxic, eight <b>skin</b> <b>corrosive</b> and an eye damage materials, one flammable liquid, five respiratory sensitizer materials, two acute hazards to the aquatic environment, four gases under pressure, two flammable gases, and five non hazardous materials. The study recommended the establishment of an emergency and poison centre in Giad Industrial City, establishment of a first aid unit in each 8 factory in addition to the application of the labeling and (MSDSs) and its translation to Arabic language. Safety training courses for the concerned staff are also recommended. It is of atmost importance to acquire relevant standard documents and articles as recommended by United Nations namely (UN Manual of tests and criteria) witch represents the main reference for (GHS) classification, and the software (Chemges) which provides important information on chemical safety...|$|E

40|$|Validated {{in vitro}} methods for skin {{corrosion}} and irritation were adopted by the OECD and by the European Union during the last decade. In the EU, Switzerland and countries adopting the EU legislation, these assays may allow the full replacement of animal testing for identifying and classifying compounds as <b>skin</b> <b>corrosives,</b> <b>skin</b> irritants, and non irritants. In order to develop harmonised recommendations {{on the use of}} in vitro data for regulatory assessment purposes within the European framework, a workshop was organized by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health together with ECVAM and the BfR. It comprised stakeholders from various European countries involved in the process from in vitro testing to the regulatory assessment of in vitro data. Discussions addressed the following questions: (1) the information requirements considered useful for regulatory assessment; (2) the applicability of in vitro skin corrosion data to assign the corrosive subcategories as implemented by the EU Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation; (3) the applicability of testing strategies for determining skin corrosion and irritation hazards; and (4) the applicability of the adopted in vitro assays to test mixtures, preparations and dilutions. Overall, a number of agreements and recommendations were achieved in order to clarify and facilitate the assessment and use of in vitro data from regulatory accepted methods, and ultimately help regulators and scientists facing with the new in vitro approaches to evaluate skin irritation and corrosion hazards and risks without animal data...|$|R

40|$|NIOSH skin notations are hazard {{warnings}} used worldwide to alert workers and employers {{to the health}} risks of skin exposures to chemicals in the workplace. This Current Intelligence Bulletin (CIB) provides the rationale for assigning new NIOSH skin notations. The new system reflects {{the current state of}} scientific knowledge and involves critical evaluation of scientific data so that scientists can assign multiple skin notations that distinguish between the systemic, direct, and sensitizing effects of skin exposures to chemicals. This new strategy is a form of hazard identification that advances our understanding of the hazards posed by skin exposures to chemicals. Such improved understanding will enable us to implement better risk management practices and controls for the prevention of workplace skin diseases and other occupational diseases where skin exposure may contribute to disease development.

40|$|The {{identification}} of tyrosinase inhibitors is important, {{not only for}} the treatment of skin hyperpigmentation disorders, such as melasma, but also for the production of cosmetic whitening effects. The aim of this study was the in silico prediction of the naturally occurring lead compounds in three commonly used skin-whitening herbs: Ampelopsis japonica, Lindera aggregata, and Ginkgo biloba. The active ingredients responsible for the whitening effect of these herbs remain largely unknown. The tyrosinase binding affinities and skin permeation, <b>skin</b> irritancy, and <b>corrosive</b> properties of 43 natural constituents of the three herbs were predicted by docking simulations using Surflex-Dock and the QSAR-based Dermal Permeability Coefficient Program (DERMWIN (TM)) and Skin Irritation Corrosion Rules Estimation Tool (SICRET) implemented in Toxtree. Nine constituents of the three herbs were found to have more advanced binding energies than the gold standard whitening agents, arbutin and kojic acid, but 40 were indicative of at least one skin sensitization alert, and many exhibited poor skin permeability. Linderagalactone c and (+) -n-methyllaurotetanine were found to have the strongest prospects for use in topical formulations, as they achieved high predicted tyrosinase binding scores and displayed good skin permeation properties and minimal potential for skin sensitization and irritation...|$|R
40|$|The Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii Mitchell 1838) is Australia's largest {{freshwater}} fish. Once highly {{abundant in}} the Murray-Darling river system, populations have drastically declined in recent decades. Many causes for this decline have been proposed, including over-fishing, habitat loss and altered river flow regimes. This study hypothesised that elevated salinities have led to selective mortality in some developmental stages, which have in turn depleted stock recruitment and adult populations. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the optimal, threshold, upper sublethal and lethal salinities for development of eggs, yolk-sac larvae, fry and fingerlings of M. peelii peelii. Investigation the impact of salinity on fertilisation utilised gametes of trout cod (M. macquariensis, Cuvier 1829) instead of M. peelii peelii. Studies were carried out in a controlled laboratory environment using test media prepared from commercial sea salt. The results showed that the eggs of the trout cod hatched only when fertilised and incubated in freshwater, and only larvae hatched in freshwater survived through the yolk absorption period of 12 days. Yolk utilisation efficiencies were not significantly different among the salinities of 0 - 0. 30 g/L. There was no effect of pre- or post- fertilising processes on the salinity tolerances of yolk-sac larvae. No larvae survived at salinities higher than 0. 30 g/L during the yolk utilisation period. Lethal salinity concentration in Trout cod and Murray cod larvae was exposure time dependent. The 1 day LC 50 of the larvae was 1. 97 and 2. 33 g/L respectively, compared with the 12 day LC 50 values of 0. 50 and 0. 35 g/L respectively. The threshold (no effect level) salinities of larvae of Trout cod and Murray cod were 0. 46 and 0. 34 g/L respectively at 12 days exposure. The salinity sensitivities of fry of Murray cod were moderated by increasing pH between pH 6. 2 and 8. 8, and stimulated by increasing temperatures from 15 to 30 C. The optimal salinity was only slightly affected by temperature. The threshold and upper sublethal salinities varied slightly depending on feeding regime. The salinity sensitivities of fingerlings of Murray cod were: LC 50 = 13. 7 g/L; optimal salinity from 4. 6 to 5. 0 g/L; threshold salinity from 5. 9 to 7. 4 g/L, and upper sub-lethal salinity from 9. 2 to 9. 9 g/L - with the range in all cases affected by acclimation period salinity. The blood osmolality at LC 50 of the fingerlings was 444 mOsmol/kgH 2 O or equivalent to 14. 2 g/L, and the dehydration rate was 4. 8 %. The osmolality increased significantly in salinities higher than 9. 0 and 6. 0 g/L when fish were exposed for a period of 1 day and 41 days respectively. The oxygen consumption increased significantly in salinities higher than 8. 0 g/L. Distortion of the notochord and <b>corrosive</b> <b>skin</b> syndrome were major symptoms describing sub-lethal effects found in the embryos, and fry and fingerlings of Murray cod respectively. Noting the risks of extrapolating directly from laboratory to field conditions, it is predicted that when salinity in natural habitats increases above 0. 34 g/L a significant impact on Murray cod recruitment will result...|$|R
