50|$|The {{largest of}} the three engines is the {{hoisting}} engine. It is a double-cylinder horizontal type with a 12 in bore and 16 in stroke. In addition to powering the hoist, it provided locomotive power and could move the shovel at speeds of a 1/4 mph. About 50 ft of the hoist chain has been removed.Both of the other engines have an 8 in bore. The swing engine, attached to a chain around the <b>swing</b> <b>circle,</b> moves the boom from side to side. The other engine, the boom or crowd engine, raises and lowers the dipper. Due to its exposure to the weather, {{it is no longer}} in working condition. The other two, wholly inside the main section, were more protected from the elements and could be operated with compressed air.|$|E

5000|$|Uneven bars: On {{the uneven}} bars (also known as {{asymmetric}} bars in the UK), the gymnast navigates two horizontal bars set at different preset heights yet alterable widths. Gymnasts perform <b>swinging,</b> <b>circling,</b> transitional, and release moves, {{as well as}} moves that pass through the handstand. The most common way to mount these bars is by jumping towards the lower bar first.|$|R

25|$|Hoop: A hoop {{may be made}} {{of plastic}} or wood, {{provided}} that it retains its shape during the routine. The interior diameter is from 51 to 90cm, and the hoop must weigh a minimum of 300g. The hoop may be of a natural color or be partially or fully covered by one or several colors, {{and it may be}} covered with adhesive tape either of the same or different color as the hoop. Fundamental requirements of a hoop routine include rotation around the hand or body and rolling, as well as <b>swings,</b> <b>circles,</b> throws, and passes through and over the hoop. The routines in hoop involves mastery in both apparatus handling and body difficulty like leaps, jumps and pivots.|$|R

60|$|Aug. 22.--Reedy monotones of locust, or {{sounds of}} katydid--I hear the latter at night, {{and the other}} both day and night. I thought the morning and evening warble of birds delightful; but I find I can listen to these strange insects with just as much pleasure. A single locust is now heard near noon from a tree two hundred feet off, as I write--a long whirring, continued, quite loud noise graded in {{distinct}} whirls, or <b>swinging</b> <b>circles,</b> increasing in strength and rapidity {{up to a certain}} point, and then a fluttering, quietly tapering fall. Each strain is continued from one to two minutes. The locust-song is very appropriate to the scene--gushes, has meaning, is masculine, is like some fine old wine, not sweet, but far better than sweet.|$|R

2500|$|The basic rode {{system is}} a line, cable, or chain several times longer than {{the depth of the}} water running from the anchor to the mooring buoy, the longer the rode is the {{shallower}} the angle of force on the anchor (it has more scope). [...] A shallower scope means more of the force is pulling horizontally so that ploughing into the substrate adds holding power but also increases the <b>swinging</b> <b>circle</b> of each mooring, so lowering the density of any given mooring field. By adding weight {{to the bottom of the}} rode, such as the use of a length of heavy chain, the angle of force can be dropped further. Unfortunately, this scrapes up the substrate in a circular area around the anchor. A buoy can be added along the lower portion of rode to hold it off the bottom and avoid this issue.|$|R
50|$|After Robert Hand's death, {{many of the}} {{portable}} flat rides were sold and removed, however the Cyclone roller coaster, Aeroplane <b>circle</b> <b>swing,</b> carousel, and kiddie rides remained along with empty buildings {{as a reminder of}} what once was.|$|R
25|$|On {{the uneven}} bars, the gymnast {{performs}} a timed routine on two parallel horizontal bars set at different heights. These bars {{are made of}} fiberglass covered in wood laminate, {{to prevent them from}} breaking. In the past, bars were made of wood, but the bars were prone to breaking, providing an incentive to switch to newer technologies. The width and height of the bars may be adjusted to the size needed by individual gymnasts. In the past, the uneven parallel bars were closer together. The bars have been moved increasingly further apart, allowing gymnasts to perform <b>swinging,</b> <b>circling,</b> transitional, and release moves that may pass over, under, and between the two bars. At the Elite level, movements must pass through the handstand. Gymnasts often mount the uneven bars using a springboard or a small mat. Chalk (MgCO3) and grips (a leather strip with holes for fingers to protect hands and improve performance) may be used by gymnasts performing this event. The chalk helps take the moisture out of gymnasts' hands to decrease friction and prevent rips (tears to the skin of the hands); dowel grips help gymnasts grip the bar.|$|R
50|$|The act {{consists}} of a performer raised into the air by a cable, trapeze or other similar apparatus, supported only by a bit clamped between her teeth. Depending on the apparatus the bit is attached to, the performer can alternately <b>swing</b> in <b>circles</b> around the ring below or spin wildly in place, controlling speed by alternately extending {{her arms and legs}} out or bringing them in close to her body to speed up (known as the conservation of angular momentum principle).|$|R

50|$|Over {{the next}} few decades, many rides {{were added to the}} park.

5000|$|While {{the older}} styles of R&B have faded from {{popularity}} nationally, the Carolina shag has gained wide popularity in <b>swing</b> dance <b>circles</b> around the US. This has not generally led to increased {{appreciation for the}} music of the beach bands, however. Many of these new shag dance aficionados prefer the [...] "R&B oldies" [...] and/or shagging to currently popular tunes that happen to have the required beat. As more networking is being done on the Internet among shag deejays and beach music fans nationwide, however, there is a growing acceptance of the regional bands by the [...] "new shaggers".|$|R

50|$|During the {{ownership}} of Robert and Virginia hand (son-in-law and daughter of the Macdonalds, respectively), there were no major additions to the park except for the coming and going of various flat rides. The biggest additions were the band shell and the <b>circle</b> <b>swing</b> ride. The Hands raised their two sons in the park, living in the log cabin home built by Virginia's parents.|$|R

60|$|He {{looked up}} to see a great bird, with {{wonderful}} broad wings, <b>swinging</b> in short <b>circles</b> about Plunger. His body and wings were dark brown, and his head was snowy white, as was his tail. His great hooked beak was yellow and his legs were yellow. Peter knew in an instant who it was. There could be no mistake. It was King Eagle, commonly known as Bald Head, though his head isn't bald at all.|$|R
5|$|The Macdonalds {{sought to}} {{maintain}} the park's natural beauty, planting 10,000shrubs in the first year, and thousands of trees during the 1930s. In the first few years, the park added a <b>circle</b> <b>swing,</b> a Whip, a miniature railroad, and in 1938, the Philadelphia Toboggan Company Rollo Coaster. World War II and the resulting rationing forced the park to close in 1943. Upon reopening in 1946, the park added the Caterpillar and a small showboat that sailed in Lake Bouquet.|$|R

50|$|Old MacDonald's Farm, an {{elaborate}} petting zoo was an animal attraction that lasted {{longer than the}} Burro Train and Seal Pool, replaced in 1978 with Montezooma's Revenge and a restaurant. In Old MacDonald's Party Garden there were a handful of themed areas where parents could host their children’s birthday party for a nominal rental fee. The coveted spot was the birdcage, an actual metal framework built up on stilts.North, across the Cable Car tracks, was Old MacDonald's Farm - a petting zoo with: goats, bunnies, and chickens, even a pair of hundred year old Galapagos tortoise, and for a short while, a baby elephant. A goat could climb the wall to a cage high atop the corner and becon folks into the enclave, for 25 cents. Parents cautioned their children to keep a tight hold on their shirt tails and bags of candy, for nothing was safe from the curious nibblings of the wandering goats. A nickel cranked in nearby converted gumball machines would buy a handful of alfalfa pellets to feed them.Henrietta - the piano-playing chicken could be found within a wooden coop surrounded by glass. Pushing a nickel in the coin slide would illuminate a red lamp atop her toy piano and signal her to peck out a song; when she’d hit enough keys, a sprinkling of corn would be released into her food tray. The petting zoo was also home to a unique riding attraction - a one horse powered carousel swing. The Knott’s had ingeniously converted a hot walker into a kiddie ride. Pairs or trios of children would sit on wooden seats suspended {{from the end of}} eight poles radiating from a central axis where a mule patiently waited under the canvas shade. The handler, wearing overalls with a bandanna around the neck, would sit on the rig behind the mule and start the <b>swings</b> <b>circling</b> by walking the mule.|$|R
25|$|Swing {{moorings}} {{also known}} as simple or single-point moorings, are the simplest and most common kind of mooring. A swing mooring consists of a single anchor {{at the bottom of}} a waterway with a rode (a rope, cable, or chain) running to a float on the surface. The float allows a vessel to find the rode and connect to the anchor. These anchors are known as swing moorings because a vessel attached to this kind of mooring <b>swings</b> in a <b>circle</b> when the direction of wind or tide changes.|$|R
50|$|The park opened as Terminal Park on May 30, 1899, {{which was}} Decoration Day (now known as Memorial Day). At {{that time in}} America, it was common for {{amusement}} parks called trolley parks to sprout {{at the end of}} trolley lines to generate weekend revenue. Without an admission fee, anyone who could afford the trolley fare could enter the park. This trolley park's first season presented its guests a bandstand, theater, dance pavilion, a roller coaster, a <b>circle</b> <b>swing,</b> and concession stands. It was later renamed Idora Park.|$|R
