5|$|Isis was {{originally}} a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion, {{which did not}} include Greek-style mysteries. Some Egyptian rituals were performed exclusively by priests, out of public view, but ordinary Egyptians were never permitted to join in. Other rituals may have reenacted events from Egyptian mythology, such as the ceremonies in honor of Osiris, {{the god of the}} afterlife and the mythological husband of Isis, that were performed at Abydos. The Greeks interpreted these myth-based rituals as mysteries. The historian Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BCE, was the first to do so. He referred to Egyptian rites reenacting the myth of the murder of Osiris as mysteries, likening them to the mysteries of Dionysus he was familiar with in Greece. He further said that the Greek worship of Dionysus was influenced by the worship of Osiris in Egypt. Various Greek writers who came after Herodotus viewed Egypt and its priests as the source of all mystical wisdom. They claimed that many elements of Greek philosophy and culture came from Egypt, including the mystery cults. Burkert and the Egyptologist Francesco Tiradritti both <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a grain of truth in these claims, as the oldest Greek mystery cults developed in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, {{at the same time that}} Greece was developing closer contacts with Egyptian culture. The imagery of the afterlife found in the mystery cults may thus have been influenced by that in Egyptian afterlife beliefs.|$|E

25|$|Shallow {{landslides}} {{can often}} happen {{in areas that}} have slopes with high permeable soils on top of low permeable bottom soils. The low permeable, bottom soils trap {{the water in the}} shallower, high permeable soils creating high water pressure in the top soils.

During an intense rainstorm, the bedrock will keep the rain trapped in the top soils of silt and sand.

The report became the focus of the Security Council's monthly Mideast meeting on 14 October. Council diplomats <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little chance that the Security Council will take any action, primarily because of objections by the United States, which said the report should be handled by the Human Rights Council.

25|$|Karjalan Liitto is an {{interest}} group of Karelian evacuees which hopes that Karelia {{will once again}} become part of Finland at some point, but does not openly demand it. Some smaller groups, such as ProKarelia, continue to campaign for the peaceful return of Karelia. However, no serious political party has openly supported this goal, and Finnish politicians generally <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no need for it, citing Finland's peace treaty with Russia. There are some individual politicians who support the return of Karelia, such as MEP Ari Vatanen, and two candidates {{in the presidential election}} of 2006: Timo Soini and Arto Lahti. Other candidates have stated that Finland has signed a peace treaty and should not campaign for the return of what are now Russian-developed territories.

25|$|Under these {{circumstances}} any political bargaining {{might well have}} been disastrous to Home Rule. Redmond desperately wanted and needed a rapid enactment of the Home Rule Act, and undoubtedly his words were a means to that end. He called on the country to support the Allied and British war effort and Britain's commitment under the Triple Entente; this was a calculated response to the situation principally in the belief that the attained measure of self-government would be granted in full after the war and to be in a stronger position to stave off a final partition of Northern Ireland. His added hope was that the common sacrifice by Irish nationalists and Unionists would bring them closer together, but above all that nationalists could not afford to allow Ulster Unionists to reap the benefit of being the only Irish to support the war effort, when they spontaneously enlisted in their 36th (Ulster) Division. He said Let Irishmen come together in the trenches and risk their lives together and spill their blood together, and I <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no power on earth that when they come home can induce them to turn as enemies upon one another.|$|E

500|$|After the Liberal {{losses in}} the 1910 elections, ILP member and {{journalist}} Henry Brailsford helped organise a Conciliation Committee for Women's Suffrage, which gathered 54 MPs from various parties.

Thus the WSPU agreed to suspend its support for window-breaking and hunger strikes while it was being negotiated. When {{it became clear that the}} bill would not pass, Pankhurst declared: [...] "If the Bill, in spite of our efforts, is killed by the Government, then... I have to <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an end to the truce." [...] When it was defeated, Pankhurst led a protest march of 300 women to Parliament Square on 18 November. They were met with aggressive police response, directed by Home Secretary Winston Churchill: officers punched the marchers, twisted arms, and pulled on women's breasts. Although Pankhurst was allowed to enter Parliament, Prime Minister Asquith refused to meet her. The incident became known as Black Friday.|$|E

Darwin was well prepared to compare this to de Candolle's [...] "warring of the species" [...] of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost.
