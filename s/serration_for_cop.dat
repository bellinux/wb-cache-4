40|$|The {{role of a}} {{facilitator}} {{is key to the}} effective establishment and sustainment of Communities of Practice (COP). This paper presents a taxonomy of facilitation tasks that have to be carried out to support various COP processes that take place during the different stages in a COP’s life-cycle. Inspired by facilitation {{research in the area of}} Group Support Systems (GSS), we identified 33 facilitation tasks. These tasks are grouped into internal facilitator roles (Information Source, Inspirator, Guide) and external facilitator roles (Information Source, PR Manager, Investigator). The COP facilitation task taxonomy can serve as a basis <b>for</b> training <b>COP</b> facilitators, as a guide <b>for</b> <b>COP</b> facilitators to prepare for and assume their role, as a starting point for developing tool support <b>for</b> <b>COP</b> facilitators, and finally as a research instrument to study COP facilitators in the field or devise experimental treatments focusing on facilitation of large online groups...|$|R

30|$|In summary, rate-dependent {{serrated}} {{plastic flow}} {{was observed in}} our MD simulations. The temporally inhomogeneous characteristic of the plastic deformation was revealed as the main determining factor of serrated flow behavior. It is not proper to directly relate the numbers of shear bands with the flow <b>serrations.</b> <b>For</b> example, {{although there is no}} serration in some Fe-based or Ce-based BMGs during nanoindentation, a number of fine shear bands are observed under the indents [34]. The unique rate-dependent spatiotemporal distributions of shear banding can be understood in terms of PEL theory. We believe that these findings can shed light on the relationship between microstructure and inhomogeneous plastic flow in BMGs.|$|R

Whether athletes demonstrate different postural stability and limb asymmetry during a quiet standing task compared with nonathletes is unknown. Fifteen collegiate basketball players and 15 nonathletes performed 3 trials of bipedal quiet stand-ing for 30 s with 60 s of rest. Postural stability measures were obtained for each limb: integration of the resultant of the cen-ter of pressure (COP) speed (anteroposterior [AP] and medio-lateral [ML] directions); COP area; and frequency (AP and ML). An asymmetry index between lower limbs was calculated <b>for</b> <b>COP</b> speed (AP and ML), COP area, and weight distribution.

40|$|M. Comm. (Business Management) This {{research}} paper {{is a study}} of the effectiveness of knowledge sharing within the communities of practice (CoPs) in a financial institution in South Africa. Specifically, the focus is on investigating the requirements <b>for</b> establishing <b>CoPs</b> that share knowledge effectively within this organisation. This was achieved through understanding the current state of knowledge sharing within the CoPs, identifying critical factors for effectively sharing knowledge and thereafter determining reasons <b>for</b> a <b>CoP</b> not being effective in sharing knowledge. The results showed that there {{is still a long way}} to go to ensure the effectiveness of knowledge sharing through CoPs. The CoPs within this financial institution are informal in nature, and therefore not necessarily given the attention that they deserve. Time used <b>for</b> <b>CoPs</b> is not maximised effectively, which reduces the chances of their effectiveness and improvement of productivity. Lack of effective system infrastructure to support knowledge sharing is also a massive challenge <b>for</b> the <b>CoPs,</b> as is not having virtual Cops to reduce challenges faced in the use of face-to-face CoPs. The literature review in chapter 2 of this paper covers the importance of the role of technology in supporting knowledge sharing, which is supportive to this finding...|$|R
