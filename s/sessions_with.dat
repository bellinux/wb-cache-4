5|$|Before Beyoncé began {{recording}} for Dangerously in Love, she {{selected the}} producers {{with whom she}} would collaborate. For two days, she held meetings with prospective producers from the West Coast across the East Coast, and had interviews with them. Beyoncé went to Miami, Florida to begin <b>sessions</b> <b>with</b> Canadian record producer Scott Storch, her first collaborator, and lived in a Miami hotel in the following months. As she wanted {{to concentrate on the}} album, Beyoncé took her time to avoid pressure build-up, significantly different from the hasty productions of Destiny's Child.|$|E

5|$|Ray of Light is {{the seventh}} studio album by American singer Madonna. It was {{released}} on February 22, 1998 by Maverick and Warner Bros. Records. After giving birth to her first child, Madonna started working on the album with producers Babyface and Patrick Leonard. Following failed <b>sessions</b> <b>with</b> them, Madonna pursued a new musical direction with English producer William Orbit. The recording took place over four months and experienced problems with Orbit's hardware arrangement, which would break down, and recording {{would have to be}} delayed until they could be repaired.|$|E
5|$|Romney used a {{bully pulpit}} {{approach}} towards promoting his agenda, staging well-organized media events to appeal {{directly to the}} public rather than pushing his proposals in behind-doors <b>sessions</b> <b>with</b> the state legislature. He dealt with a public crisis of confidence in Boston's Big Dig project– that followed a fatal ceiling collapse in 2006– by wresting control of the project from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority. After two years of negotiating the state's participation in the landmark Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that instituted a cap-and-trade arrangement for power plant emissions in the Northeast, Romney pulled Massachusetts out of the initiative shortly before its signing in December 2005, citing a lack of cost limits for industry.|$|E

5|$|Rundgren {{had become}} {{confident}} enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards {{that he had}} tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles {{in an attempt to}} record an entire album single-handedly. After he had created significantly more material than would fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live <b>sessions,</b> <b>with</b> the help of Moogy Klingman, to lighten the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album.|$|E
5|$|Sessions for Living in the Material World {{took place}} at Apple Studio in central London and at Harrison's Friar Park studio, FPSHOT, {{beginning}} in October 1972. Despite his original intention to co-produce with Phil Spector as before, Harrison was sole producer throughout the <b>sessions,</b> <b>with</b> Phil McDonald again serving as recording engineer. While Harrison succeeded in paring down the album's production after the Wall of Sound excesses of All Things Must Pass, commentators note that he incorporated aspects of Spector's signature style on this and other songs on Material World, {{through the use of}} orchestral strings and brass, a choir and multiple drummers.|$|E
5|$|The Sopranos is an American crime drama {{television}} series created by David Chase. The story {{revolves around the}} fictional character, New Jersey-based Italian American mobster Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini).

These are often highlighted during his therapy <b>sessions</b> <b>with</b> psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco). The series features Tony's family members, mafia colleagues and rivals, in prominent roles and story arcs, most notably his wife Carmela (Edie Falco) and protégé Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli).|$|E

5|$|The album's initial {{recording}} {{began in}} New York, where Beyoncé invited producers and songwriters {{to live with}} her for a month. During extensive touring the following year, the album changed as she conceived of creating a visual accompaniment to its songs and resumed recording <b>sessions</b> <b>with</b> electronic producer and rock musician Boots. Their collaboration led to more sonically experimental material, which combined contemporary R with electronic and soul music. Throughout this period, the album's songs and videos were composed in strict secrecy as Beyoncé devised an unexpected release.|$|E
5|$|White {{missed the}} opening of NBA camp on Monday October 1, due to a desire to have a {{contractual}} plan put in place with the Rockets and the NBA that addressed the league wide mental health policy or lack thereof. After <b>sessions</b> <b>with</b> his own long-time doctor, White requested permission to travel by bus when {{necessary in order to}} limit his flight schedule. The Rockets and White came to an agreement regarding travel, including allowing White travel by personal bus rather than flying (which has been an anxiety trigger in the past for white). White missed the first week of training camp before this agreement was put in place.|$|E
5|$|Before {{releasing}} the documentary, Madonna invited {{a select group}} of friends and co-workers to watch a rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill. The film was trimmed after negative feedback regarding excessive details about Kabbalah. For the promotion and premiere of the film, Madonna appeared at Q <b>sessions</b> <b>with</b> the press and also gave a speech to film students at New York's Hunter College. Critical response to I'm Going to Tell You a Secret was mixed, with reviewers complimenting the live performances and the scenes involving her children and family, but criticizing the self-indulgent and preachy nature. I'm Going to Tell You a Secret was released in a two-disc format, a CD with 14 songs from the show and a DVD with the documentary film. It received a positive response from critics but was a moderate success commercially.|$|E
