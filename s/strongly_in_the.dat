5|$|Most World Tour stage {{races are}} won by strong climbers. The Eneco Tour is unusual because the favourites for overall victory were {{classics}} riders—those who perform <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ardennes classics and the cobbled classics that {{feature in the}} early part of the cycling season.|$|E
5|$|Poland {{qualified}} for the 1982 World Cup with a perfect record, and performed <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> competition, losing to Italy in the semi-finals but beating France in a play-off to claim third place. Kulesza became the manager of Tunisia, and later founded a coaching school in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{killer whales}} are not {{considered}} a threat to humans, {{but there have been}} cases of captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks. Killer whales feature <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mythologies of indigenous cultures, with their reputation ranging from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.|$|E
30|$|We {{say that}} f(u,v) is <b>strongly</b> {{decreasing}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first argument and <b>strongly</b> increasing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second argument {{if it is}} differentiable and has first partial derivative D_ 1 f negative and second partial derivative D_ 2 f positive in a considered set. The connection between the theory of monotone maps and the asymptotic behavior of Equation (4) follows {{from the fact that}} if f is <b>strongly</b> decreasing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first argument and <b>strongly</b> increasing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second argument, then the second iterate of a map associated with Equation (4) is a strongly competitive map on I× I.|$|R

5|$|Leigh next {{sought the}} role of Blanche DuBois in the West End stage {{production}} of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and was cast after Williams and the play's producer Irene Mayer Selznick saw her in The School for Scandal and Antigone; Olivier was contracted to direct. The play contained a rape scene and references to promiscuity and homosexuality, and {{was destined to be}} controversial; the media discussion about its suitability added to Leigh's anxiety. Nevertheless, she believed <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> importance of the work.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Spirit Fruit Society lived {{according}} to the following basic principles: seek happiness through selflessness; follow one's conscience; take responsibility for one's actions—and develop {{an awareness of the}} consequences of one's actions on others; and accept whatever happens. Beilhart believed very <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> individual's right to guide his own actions, and not be dictated to by others. While {{there was no mention of}} any kind of organization or hierarchy in any documents, as the leader, Beilhart likely made important decisions concerning the group. There is no record of any kind of internal conflict between members.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 2007, Judah {{made his}} return to the ring against Ruben Galvan at the Fitzgeralds Casino & Hotel in Tunica, Mississippi. Judah came out <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round, landing {{numerous}} shots on Galvan. During the round, a bad cut opened near the top of Galvan's head. The referee called for a timeout to allow the doctor {{to take a look at}} the cut. Due to the severity of the cut, the fight was waved off. The cut was ruled to be caused by an accidental foul with an elbow and since the fight did not go past four rounds, the fight was ruled a no contest.|$|E

5|$|Romanticism was {{a complex}} artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that {{originated in the}} second half of the eighteenth century in western Europe, and gained strength during and after the Industrial and French Revolutions. It was partly a revolt against the political norms of the Age of Enlightenment which rationalised nature, and was embodied most <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> visual arts, music, and literature, but significantly influenced historiography, philosophy and the natural sciences.|$|E
5|$|The team mostly lay {{low in the}} race's {{first week}} and a half, with only fourth in a sprint from Assan Bazayev in Stage 4 and fifth in Stage 6 by Maxim Iglinsky from a {{breakaway}} to show for themselves through nine stages. Contador and Klöden both showed <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Stage 10 individual time trial, with Contador missing the stage win by just 8 seconds (Klöden was third, 20 seconds off Marzio Bruseghin's winning time) and moving from eighth to fourth in the overall classification.|$|E
5|$|Vincenzo Nibali {{was also}} {{cited as a}} {{potential}} winner of the race, following a difficult season. He had struggled during the Tour de France and was subsequently {{thrown out of the}} Vuelta for holding on to a team car. He had therefore made Il Lombardia a significant target. Nibali had performed <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other late-season Italian classics, while his team had shown its strength in supporting Diego Rosa to victory in Milano–Torino. Fabio Aru, who had won the Vuelta, was not present: he was riding the Tour of Almaty instead.|$|E

5|$|With the {{exception}} of infrared wavelengths close to visible light, such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places on Earth or in space. Some molecules radiate <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infrared. This allows {{the study of the}} chemistry of space; more specifically it can detect water in comets.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1925, Pflueger {{designed}} a , 28-story, step-back skyscraper made of brick framed with steel, {{along the lines}} of his just-completed Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building. Its main decorative theme was neo-Gothic, expressed <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three Gothic arches which formed the main street-level entrance for the church. The Great Hall, the large worship area located within the second, third and fourth floors was to seat 1,500 churchgoers and a smaller chapel was designed for 125 more. A grand pipe organ from Skinner Organ Company was installed with four manuals controlling 3,881 pipes. A stained glass window was placed 80 feet above the sanctuary, representing Faith, Love and Hope in three tall, narrow panels. Two assembly halls could be combined to hold 1,100 attendees for theatrical or athletic events. Some 500 guest rooms and 32 tower apartments were intended to bring a steady flow of visitors and a source of profit to the church. Though never the tallest building in San Francisco, it was to be the tallest hotel on the Pacific Coast for many decades.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{was lucky}} to escape from a crash in the Masaryk Grand Prix. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, {{bringing}} it crashing down onto the road. Caracciola and Chiron drove into a ditch {{at the side of}} the road to avoid the debris; while Chiron drove out of the ditch and was able to continue, Caracciola drove into a tree and retired. Despite this accident, Caracciola again performed <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight climbs in his SSKL to take the title. Perhaps his most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of Alfa Romeos battled for the lead early in the race, but when they fell back Caracciola was able to take control. His win, in record time, made him and his co-driver Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the full course were Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in 1955.|$|E

For example, taboos against dead bodies, especially dead human bodies, are <b>strongly</b> emphasized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature, and human and animal dissections were the most problematic STEM activities according to our survey respondents.|$|R

5|$|FLCN {{creates a}} protein called folliculin that has two isoforms. It appears {{to act as}} a tumor {{suppressor}} and is expressed <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skin, distal nephrons, and type I pneumocytes. It has also been found in the parotid gland, brain, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovaries. Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division, leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism, possibly through modulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and/or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (FLCN-interacting protein) to form a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase. Folliculin's participation in the mTOR pathway may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome, Cowden syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.|$|E
5|$|For {{his last}} two starts of the year, Fantastic Light was sent to East Asia. In November, in the Japan Cup he stayed on <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closing stages to finish a close third, beaten a neck and a nose by T M Opera O and Meisho Doto. Dettori {{reportedly}} felt that the slow pace {{was the reason for}} his defeat. Despite three successive defeats, Fantastic Light still managed to end the season with a major victory. In December he was sent to Sha Tin for the Hong Kong Cup and justified favouritism by leading in the straight and staying on strongly to beat Greek Dance and Jim and Tonic. The win earned Fantastic Light top place in the Emirates World Series, a competition in which points were awarded for performances in a number of international races.|$|E
5|$|Froome, who {{had been}} second in the 2011 and 2014 Vueltas, had had a strong season, with {{victories}} in the , the Critérium du Dauphiné and the Tour de France. He was attempting {{to become the first}} rider since Bernard Hinault in 1978 to win both the Tour and the Vuelta in the same season, though it was expected that he would be tired following his victory in the Tour. The individual time trial was expected to favour Froome, who is strong in the discipline. Before the race, however, Froome was uncertain about his form and his ability to win the race. Quintana's only stage race victory of the season had come in the Tirreno–Adriatico, but he had performed <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Alps in the Tour's final stages, and the mountainous route of the Vuelta was expected to suit him.|$|E

5|$|Having won two {{medals in}} {{an equal number}} of participations, John Heaton, Gregor Stähli, Martins Dukurs and Aleksandr Tretyakov are the joint medal leaders in Olympic skeleton, {{although}} only Tretyakov managed to win a gold medal. As of 2014, the United States are the most successful National Olympic Committee (NOC) in Olympic skeleton, having won eight medals (three golds, four silvers and one bronze). Great Britain comes next with six medals (two golds, one silver and three bronzes), and is the only NOC to have collected a medal every Games that skeleton has featured at the Winter Olympics; they have featured particularly <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> women's event, with 2 of 4 the gold medalists, and 4 of the 12 total medalists. Thirty medals have been awarded to twenty-six sledders representing nine NOCs.|$|E
5|$|Nkomo {{remained}} unchallenged at {{the head}} of ZAPU, but the ZANU leadership had become contested between its founding president, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole, and Robert Mugabe, a former teacher from Mashonaland who had recently won an internal election in prison. When they were released in December 1974 under the détente terms, Mugabe went to Mozambique to consolidate his leadership of the guerrillas, while Sithole joined Muzorewa's delegation. It had been agreed that the talks would take place within Rhodesia, but the black nationalists refused to meet on ground they perceived as not neutral. The Rhodesians insisted on abiding by the accord and negotiating inside the country. To please both camps the conference was held on a train halfway across the Victoria Falls Bridge on the border between Rhodesia and Zambia; the delegations sat {{on opposite sides of the}} frontier. The conference, which took place on 26 August 1975 with Kaunda and Vorster as mediators, failed to produce a settlement; each side accused the other of being unreasonable. Smith afterwards held direct talks with Nkomo and ZAPU in Salisbury, but these also led nowhere; Nkomo proposed an immediate transition to an interim government headed by himself, which Smith rejected. Guerrilla incursions picked up <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first months of 1976.|$|E
5|$|On {{his debut}} for Somerset, Poyntz batted <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower {{order to help}} secure Somerset's only victory of the season. Poyntz's score of 32 in the first innings could not prevent the follow-on, but in the second innings, he hit 60 runs to widen Somerset's lead to almost 150 runs, a total Gloucestershire failed to chase down. His success against Gloucestershire {{continued}} in the return fixture later that season, in which he scored 89 of Somerset's total of 169 in the first innings, and 42 runs in the second innings, though their opponents won by an innings after amassing 521 runs in their only innings. In all, Poyntz played five matches in his debut season, totalling 307 runs. His season's batting average of 34.11 was the highest of his career.|$|E
