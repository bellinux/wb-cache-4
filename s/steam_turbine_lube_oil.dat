There are great differences in the cleaning processes that are used to clean exchanger bundles in industry today.

40|$|The 5 MW(e) Dual Boiling Cycle Geothermal Power Plant, hence {{referred}} to as the Raft River plant, is being developed for DOE by EG and G, Inc., Idaho Falls, Idaho. This pilot power plant is of the binary concept and utilizes isobutane as the working second fluid. The plant will demonstrate the feasibility of power generation from an intermediate temperature ({approx} 290 F) resource. The plant is schematically diagrammed in Figure 1. During the final design phase and after the major components were specified to be made of carbon steel, and ordered, various conditions forced the power plant design to switch from surface water to geothermal fluid for the condenser cooling loop make-up water. Because the geothermal fluid contains significant concentrations of chlorides and sulfates, about 1000 ppm and 65 ppm respectively, aeration in the cooling tower causes this water to become extremely aggressive, especially in the pitting of carbon steel components. Although essentially all of the condenser cooling loop materials are carbon steel, the isobutane condenser and <b>turbine</b> <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> cooler are the most vulnerable. These components are tubed with carbon steel tubes of 0. 085 and 0. 075 inch wall thickness. These two components are extremely leak critical heat exchangers. For example, even a single pit perforation in the isobutane condenser can cause plant shutdown through loss of isobutane. Such a leak also poses an explosion or fire hazard. As isobutane pressure falls, the incursion of cooling water into the isobutane loop could occur, causing damage to anhydrous service seals. Under a DOE contract for geothermal failure analysis, Radian Corporation has made a preliminary investigation of the pitting hazard presented by the aggressive cooling fluid and the corrosion inhibition treatment that has thus far been proposed. This report documents Radian's understanding of the present situation and the results of its investigation on possible mitigation of this hazard. Finally, various conclusions and recommendations are made that may, if pursued, lead to a satisfactory solution that will avert a certain early prolonged plant shutdown due to failure of the thin walled isobutane and <b>turbine</b> <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> cooler tubes...|$|R

This Report is a 10 week progress report that specifically addresses itself to the differences that are encountered between Units 5 - 6, 7 - 10 and 11 - 12.

The <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> separator functions to purify the <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> to ensure its good working performance. The working condition of the oil separator will greatly influence the normal running of many plants. The <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> separator used in our laboratory is Mitsubishi SJ 700. In the processing of purifying, oil leakage from the water outlet is found. In order to find failure point, the basic structure and the working principle of the separator is introduced. The separator is dismantled according to the procedure. After cleaning some parts found dirty and replacing some sealing elements, the separator is reassembled. When starting the separating process again, the failure remains. Through further analyzing the structure and working principle of the separator, the trouble spot is found out.

An essential requirement is a reliable oil supply {{over the whole}} operating range. The main oil pump carries {{to a large degree}} this responsibility. The design and operational aspects of it will be dealt with in this paper. Air dispersed in oil is known to endanger, in extreme cases, the safe and reliable operation of the turbogroup.

Without going into details of oil qualities, operational consequences as well as corrective measures, of air present in oil will be discussed.

Diesel ash emissions are the non-combustible portion of diesel particulate matter and are mainly derived from metallic <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> additives such as Ca, Mg, and Zn {{as well as}} engine wear metals including Fe. Diesel particulate filters (DPF) are used to filter engine particle emissions and are routinely regenerated, oxidizing the material in the filter. After filter regeneration, metallic ash remains. Over time, this ash can build up in the filter, increasing the filter pressure drop and eventually plugging the filter. Ash emissions {{can also be used}} to calculate engine <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> consumption. A high temperature oxidation method (HTOM) has been developed to measure ash emissions in real-time. The HTOM uses a tube oven to oxidize the combustible fraction of an engine exhaust sample. The remaining particles are then measured with real-time and near real-time particle sampling techniques. The HTOM system improvements are discussed along with validation testing and further recommendations regarding improvements in the apparatus and procedure. Atomized <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> was used as a test aerosol. Special <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> blends were formulated to determine measurement sensitivity to specific ash constituents. Ca and Mg were readily detectable by the HTOM. However, the HTOM was not very sensitive to Zn based additives. Chemical equilibrium models show that Ca and Mg formed stable oxides at oven temperatures while Zn went to a gaseous phase. Repeatability in <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> spray ash measurements was better than 10 %. Engine exhaust repeats did not show as good repeatability. However engine exhaust is a much less stable and repeatable aerosol. Steady-state engine ash emissions were sampled from two different Diesel engines (1. 9 L VW and Cummins APU) at different speeds and loads. <b>Lube</b> <b>oil</b> doped fuel was also used in the engine tests to artificially increase oil consumption and ash emissions. The engine <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> consumption was predicted from known <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> ash concentrations and measured ash emissions. The non-doped fuel tests yielded lower than expected <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> consumption estimates while the doped tests showed an ash recovery of 31 %. Transient ash measurements were demonstrated. Ash and soot measurements were made downstream a loading DPF. The downstream soot particle surface area concentrations tracked better with the ash than soot volume concentrations. Transient engine speed and loads were also measured by the HTOM. Ash diameter concentrations were measured in real-time showing definite spikes of ash emissions at transient load steps...|$|R

Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy issued a Research Call to develop nanomanufacturing capabilities at the National Laboratories. High performance catalysts represent {{a unique opportunity to}} deploy nanomanufacturing technologies.

Improved catalysts are required to produce a better quality product, decrease environmental impact, extend catalyst life, and improve overall economics of <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> re-refining. Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne) in cooperation with Universal Lubricants, Inc. (ULI) and Chemical Engineering Partners (CEP) have carried out a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to prepare nanostructured hydrotreating catalysts using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to exhibit superior performance for the re-refining of used <b>lube</b> <b>oil.</b> We investigated the upgrading of recycled <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> by hydrogenation using commercial, synthetically-modified commercial catalysts, and synthesized catalysts. A down-flow (trickle bed) catalytic unit was used for the hydrogenation experiments. In addition to carrying out elemental analyses of the various feed and product fractions, characterization was undertaken using H{sup 1 } and C{sup 13 } NMR. Initially commercial were evaluated. Second these commercial catalysts were promoted with precious metals using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Performance improvements were observed that declined with catalyst aging. An alternate approach was undertaken to deeply upgrade ULI product oils. Using a synthesized catalyst, much lower hydrogenation temperatures were required than commercial catalysts. Other performance improvements were also observed. The resulting <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> fractions were of high purity even at low reaction severity. The products recovered from both the ALD and other processes were water-white (even those from the low temperature, low residence time (high space velocity), low conversion runs).
