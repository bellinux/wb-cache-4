5|$|CPG is {{commonly}} defined by its pore size. In oligonucleotide chemistry, pore sizes of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000Å {{are used to}} allow the preparation of about 50, 80, 100, 150, and 200-mer oligonucleotides, respectively. To make native CPG <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> further processing, {{the surface of the}} material is treated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane to give aminopropyl CPG. The aminopropyl arm may be further extended to result in long chain aminoalkyl (LCAA) CPG. The amino group is then used as an anchoring point for linkers <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> oligonucleotide synthesis (see below).|$|E
5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly {{in the spring and}} are <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> early crops, while heavy clays retain moisture better and are more <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece, cloches, plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is constrained by the temperature and day length.|$|E
