For CCM correctors, the input current is shaped to be sinusoidal superimposed with high frequency ripples and the power factor could approach unity for small ripple amplitude. However, DCM control usually reduces the circuit complexity which translates to lower production cost and particularly suitable for low power applications. The main drawback is the excessive high frequency harmonics generated by the discontinuous conducting current and the attenuation of these switching ripples is usually required {{to arrive at a}} nearly sinusoidal input current for high power factor. Although DCM control scheme in PFC {{plays an important role in}} power processing, power factor analysis mainly concern about the CCM operation and the filtered input current with negligible ripples.

40|$|This thesis reports an {{investigation}} into the design of converters for induction heating systems based upon resonant <b>switch</b> <b>mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> techniques. The proposed three phase unity power factor induction heating system consists of two stages of power conversions. The important requirements for each stage of the power conversion of a typical induction heating system working from a three-phase supply are identified. A wide range of power converters which fulfil these requirements are compared and evaluated. From the evaluation, the most applicable converter topologies are selected. Each selected converter class is investigated in great detail to outline their advantages and disadvantages. The first stage consists of a push-pull buck converter connected to a unity power factor rectifier stage. This stage converts the three phase AC mains supply to a required DC value. The second stage, which converters the DC into AC is a single ended resonant inverter system. Analysis of the converters has been made and the design procedure has been formulated. The design procedure allows a strenuous design of each resonant converter for particular converter applications. The final converter design has been simulated using the circuit simulation software packages Design Architect and Accusim to verify the results of analysis. The most important design and construction achievements can be summarised as follows: I A novel push-pull buck quasi-resonant converter with a three-phase rectifier stage has been built and tested. At its maximum operating frequency of 40 kHz, the prototype converter delivers an output power of 500 W. The converter draws nearly sinusoidal currents from the three-phase mains supply and has an input power factor approaching unity. A secondary stage resonant converter provides AC for the induction heater coil. This AC current flowing in the induction coil creates an alternating electromagnetic field for the workpiece. An induction heating coil has been designed and built by using electrical equivalent coil design method. A novel control strategy was developed to provide output power control. Both converter and inverter stage of the system are operated in the zero-current switching condition. The use of this technique allows higher switching frequencies and provides low switching losses. The full design details are presented along with simulation and practical results. The simulation and practical performance results presented show good correlation with theoretical predictions...|$|E

The classic method, utilized in most PWM converters, {{is to place}} the inductor in a path that has a non-zero average current. Such inductors are referred to here as "DC inductors". In contrast, inductors that operate with zero average current are denoted "AC inductors". The theoretical analysis carried out in this paper compares the small signal response of the current in the DC and AC inductors {{as a function of}} various system parameters, such as input and output voltages and duty cycle, {{in the case of the}} DC inductor, and frequency in the case of the AC inductor. The analysis was supported by large and small signal model developed in this study and verified against analytically derived large and small signal equations. The small signal current response was derived by applying average models. The analytical derivations and simulations of this study were verified experimentally. Good agreement was found between the theoretical predications and the analytical results. Based on the results of this study one can conclude that "AC inductor " based topologies are optimal for current sourcing applications, such as battery chargers, where differences between the average input and output voltages are expected to exist and develop over time.

The nature of <b>switch</b> <b>mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> makes them a potential source of EMI noise emission. EMI filters are generally necessary to ensure electromagnetic compatibility of converters to the other electronic equipment. Conventional discrete EMI filters usually comprise passive components with different volume and form factors.

One marjor difficulty, however, is its high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR). If a class A power amplifier is used, a 5 MHz OFDM signal should be back-offed to an unacceptable level which gives an average power efficiency of about 5 %. To reduce the PAPR, many baseband techniques have been proposed. However, even these techniques are applied, a linear power amplifier is still required and the power efficiency cannot be improved too much. Instead of attempting to reduce peak-to-average power ratio, a power amplifier linearization technique called Envelope Elimination and Restoration (EER) is adopted in this project to amplify the OFDM signal.
