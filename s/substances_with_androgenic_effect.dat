25|$|The androgenic:anabolic {{ratio of}} an AAS is an {{important}} factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating hypogonadism in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity <b>with</b> weak <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects.</b> This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{activity}} of boldenone is mainly anabolic, <b>with</b> a low <b>androgenic</b> potency. Boldenone will increase nitrogen retention, protein synthesis, increases appetite and stimulates {{the release of}} erythropoietin in the kidneys. Boldenone was synthesized {{in an attempt to}} create a long-acting injectable methandrostenolone (Dianabol), for androgen deficiency disorders. Boldenone acts similar to methandrostenolone <b>with</b> fewer adverse <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects.</b> [...] Although commonly compared to nandrolone, boldenone lacks progesterone receptor interaction and all the associated progestogenic side effects.|$|R
30|$|Vitamin C potentiates the estrogenic {{effects in}} {{vascular}} levels and also reduces {{the effectiveness of}} testosterone (Hwang et al. 2000). Alongside the increased estrogenic activity, vitamin C also has a protective role against the BC (Kim et al. 2006), coronary artery disease (Hwang et al. 2000) and osteoporosis (Sahni et al. 2009). Thus, vitamin C may loco regionally reduces the HL by increased estrogenic <b>effects</b> along <b>with</b> decreased <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> on the scalp, when locally applied with an oil-based buffer that enables vitamin C to pass across the hair texture.|$|R
40|$|Background: Growth hormone {{is widely}} abused by athletes, {{frequently}} <b>with</b> <b>androgenic</b> steroids. Its <b>effects</b> on performance are unclear. Objective: To determine {{the effect of}} growth hormone alone or with testosterone on body composition and measures of performance. Design: Randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded study of 8 weeks of treatment followed by a 6 -week washout period. Randomization was computer-generated with concealed allocation. (Australian– New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry registration number...|$|R
25|$|Prasterone is {{produced}} naturally {{in the human}} body, but {{the long-term effects of}} its use are largely unknown. In the short term, several studies have noted few adverse effects. In a study by Chang et al., prasterone was administered at a dose of 200mg/day for 24 weeks <b>with</b> slight <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> noted. Another study utilized a dose up to 400mg/day for 8 weeks with few adverse events reported. A longer term study followed patients dosed with 50mg of prasterone for 12 months with the number and severity of side effects reported to be small. Another study delivered a dose of 50mg of prasterone for 10 months with no serious adverse events reported.|$|R
25|$|Progesterone {{does not}} bind to the {{androgen}} receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and hence does not possess any direct androgenic or antiandrogenic activity. This {{is in contrast}} to many progestins, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives (e.g., norethisterone, dienogest) and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives (e.g., cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate), which do bind to the AR and have been associated <b>with</b> <b>androgenic</b> or antiandrogenic <b>effects</b> depending on the progestin in question.|$|R
25|$|Although {{progesterone}} {{does not}} bind {{directly to the}} AR, it is a precursor and intermediate in the biosynthesis of androgens from cholesterol. For this reason, {{there has been some}} speculation that exogenous progesterone could be transformed into androgens by certain tissues that express the requisite enzymes. Progesterone is converted by 17α-hydroxylase into 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is converted by 17,20-lyase into androstenedione, and androstenedione is converted by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases into testosterone. CYP17A1, the cytochrome P450 gene that encodes 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, is expressed mainly in the gonads (ovaries and testes) and the adrenal glands. Despite the reasoning that progesterone could be converted into androgens however, clinical studies in which women were treated with 100 to 300mg/day OMP have found no or only a small increase in levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and no change in androgen levels, including those of dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, and testosterone. In these studies, levels of estradiol and cortisol, which progesterone is also a precursor of, did not change either, although levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone did increase significantly. In accordance with the lack of changes in androgen levels, progesterone, unlike various progestins, has not been associated <b>with</b> <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> in clinical studies, including changes in the blood lipid profile or sex hormone-binding globulin levels, acne, skin oiliness, hirsutism, or voice deepening, or induction of teratogenicity (i.e., virilization of female fetuses).|$|R
50|$|Adrenosterone, {{also known}} as Reichstein's {{substance}} G , as well as 11-ketoandrostenedione (11-KA4), 11-oxoandrostenedione (11-OXO), and androst-4-ene-3,11,17-trione, is a steroid hormone <b>with</b> a weak <b>androgenic</b> <b>effect,</b> and an intermediate/prohormone of 11-ketotestosterone. It was first isolated in 1936 from the adrenal cortex by Tadeus Reichstein at the Pharmaceutical Institute in the University of Basel. Originally, adrenosterone was called Reichstein's substance G. Adrenosterone occurs in trace amounts in humans {{as well as most}} mammals and in larger amounts in fish, where it is a precursor to the primary androgen, 11-ketotestosterone.|$|R
40|$|Background: Globularia alypum L. (Globulariaceae) is a shrub {{growing in}} the Mediterranean basin and known {{to be used as}} a popular {{medicine}} for its several pharmacological properties against rheumatism, gout, typhoid, intermittent fever, and diabetes. Materials and Methods: The acute and chronic toxicities of a G. alypum L. aqueous leaf extract were studied in animals. Acute toxicity was performed in male and female mice whereas chronic toxicity was realized in male and female rats that orally received the drug at the doses of 300 and 600 mg/kg/ 24 h for 30 days. Results: Acute toxicity showed that the extract, administered by the oral route, does not induce any mortality even for a dose of 10, 000 mg/kg. Administered by the intra-peritoneal route to female and male mice, the LD 50 of the extract was found to be of 2750 and 2550 mg/kg, respectively. A chronic toxicity study showed that, compared to the control groups that only received the vehicle (water), the drugs affects weight growth (effects more pronounced in female than in male rats), some organs weight after autopsy, hematological and biochemical parameters and histology of some principal organs (lungs: histological grades I to II pulmonary hypertension (PHT), respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and lymphoid hyperplasia; esophagus: thinning down of esophageal wall, atrophic muscular coat). The most important finding of the study was the recorded active spermatogenesis induced by the reiterated administrations of the drug that was confirmed by reducing the administered dose and the period of treatment (100 mg/kg/ 24 h for 15 days). Conclusion: It is suggested that the G. alypum L. leaf extract contains active <b>substances</b> <b>with</b> <b>androgenic</b> properties that could be used in human therapy...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In recent years, {{several new}} oral {{contraceptives}} have become available. In some ways, they represent an evolution {{in terms of}} individualization and compliance {{on the part of}} women. The new formulations make it increasingly possible to prescribe a specific hormonal contraceptive on an individual basis. METHODS: A systematic literature search of PubMed was performed using the following combination of terms: 'oral contraceptives', 'estroprogestins' and 'combined oral contraceptive'. Only English-language papers published between January 2000 and July 2014 were included in our analysis. The present review analyzes all aspects of the choice of oral contraceptives in the different phases of a woman's life in detail. RESULTS: Regarding the estrogen component, lowering the dose of ethinylestradiol (EE) helped reduce associated side effects. Natural estradiol is now available and represents a valid alternative to EE. And regarding progestins, the dose has changed over time, as well as the endocrine and metabolic characteristics. These are the fruit of much research into improvement of old products (19 -nor-progesterone-derived progestins) <b>with</b> <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> and testing of new molecules with improved metabolic neutrality in terms of insulin sensitivity and lipid parameters. New progestins were a genuine turning point because they greatly reduced major side effects, such as water retention, and their anti-androgenic properties made them indicated for all forms of hyperandrogenism associated with acne and mild hirsutism. The associations of estradiol/dienogest and estradiol/nomegestrol acetate are the most suitable contraceptives for women with abundant menstrual bleeding and can increase the number of potential users of hormonal contraception. CONCLUSION: Progress in the provision of new oral contraceptives has improved the risk/benefit ratio, by increasing benefits and reducing risks. The present challenge is to tailor contraceptives to individual needs in terms of efficacy and protection of reproductive health...|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc {{countries such as}} East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur weight lifters. In response {{to the success of}} Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS <b>with</b> reduced <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects.</b> Ziegler's work resulted in the production of methandrostenolone, which Ciba Pharmaceuticals marketed as Dianabol. The new steroid was approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1958. It was most commonly administered to burn victims and the elderly. The drug's off-label users were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. Although Ziegler prescribed only small doses to athletes, he soon discovered that those having abused Dianabol suffered from enlarged prostates and atrophied testes. AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the IOC in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition.|$|R
40|$|The progestins have {{different}} pharmacologic properties {{depending upon the}} parent molecule, usually testosterone or progesterone (P), from which they are derived. Very small structural changes in the parent molecule may induce con-siderable differences in {{the activity of the}} derivative. In hormonal contraceptives, progestins represent the major agent designed for suppressing ovulation and are used in combination with estrogen (E) usually ethinyl-estradiol (EE). The development of new generations of progestins with improved selectivity profiles has been a great challenge. Steroidal and nonsteroidal progesterone receptor (PR) agonists have been synthesized as well, although the latter are still in a very early stage of development. Several new progestins, have been synthesized in the last two decades. These include dienogest (DNG), drospirenone (DRSP), Nestorone (NES), nomegestrol acetate (NOMAc) and trimegestone (TMG). These new progestins have been designed to have no androgenic or estrogenic actions and to be closer in activity to the physiological hormone P. DRSP differs from the classic progestins as it is derived from spirolactone. It is essentially an antimineralocorticoid steroid <b>with</b> no <b>androgenic</b> <b>effect</b> but a partial antiandrogenic effect. The antiovulatory potency of the different progestins varies. TMG and NES are the most potent progestins synthesized to date, followed by two of the older progestins, keto-desogestrel (keto-DSG) and levonorgestrel (LNG). The new mole-cules TMG, DRSP and DNG also have antiandrogenic activity. Striking differences exist regarding the side effects among the progestins and the combination with EE leads to other reactions related to the E itself and whether th...|$|R

40|$|We aim {{to assess}} the effects of {{metformin}} treatment on metabolic and endocrine parameters and genes expression related to the insulin-responsive pathway in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study comprises twenty-eight obese mice divided into three metformin-treated groups for seven and twenty days and eight nonobese and nontreated ones. We found {{a significant decrease in}} glycemia after metformin treatment at days seven and twenty. However, we did not observe differences in body weight measurement. Histologically, after twenty days we observed follicular development <b>with</b> regression of <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects.</b> Levels of IGF- 1 R protein expression were low after twenty days of treatment, but LEP proteins showed an overexpression in the ovarian stroma. We assessed the IGF- 1 R and LEP mRNAs levels; data showed a significant overexpression of LEP after seven days of treatment, while the IGF- 1 R was downregulated. Metformin therapy seems to exert a beneficial effect on histological and anovulatory features, reducing follicular number and pyknosis formation, possibly involved in the reversion of androgenic stimulus. Expression of IGF- 1 and LEPR indicates a relevant role in androgenic features reversion present in PCOS, hormonal equilibrium, body weight regulation, and glucose metabolism, therefore, under phenotype obesity and infertility regulation in this model...|$|R
50|$|None of the SARMs yet {{developed}} {{are truly}} selective for anabolic effects in muscle or bone tissues without producing any <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> in tissues {{such as the}} prostate gland, however several nonsteroidal androgens show a ratio of anabolic to <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> of greater than 3:1 and up {{to as much as}} 90:1 (RAD-140), compared to testosterone, which has a ratio of 1:1.|$|R

50|$|LGD-3303 {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as a {{selective}} androgen receptor modulator (SARM), with good oral bioavailability. It is a selective agonist for the androgen receptor, producing functional selectivity with effective dissociation of anabolic and <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects,</b> acting as a partial agonist for <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects,</b> but a full agonist for anabolic effects. It has been investigated as a possible treatment for osteoporosis, and was shown in animal studies to enhance {{the effectiveness of a}} bisphosphonate drug.|$|R
50|$|Quinbolone {{itself has}} very few <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects,</b> {{and most of}} what it does have {{are a result of}} its {{conversion}} to boldenone and its metabolites. Because of high doses necessary for <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects,</b> cost and inconvenience meant that quinbolone never proved to be commercially successful, and its clinical applications were fulfilled by alternative, more effective, steroids. Its illicit usage in bodybuilding and athletics likewise proved limited, though drug tests are still used to detect its metabolites as it remains a banned substance for most competitive sports.|$|R
50|$|As can be seen, the {{percentage}} of free testosterone is tripled in women being treated with danazol. The ability of danazol to increase free testosterone levels suggests that a portion of its weak <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> are mediated indirectly by facilitating the activity of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone through the displacement of them from SHBG. In addition to binding to and occupying SHBG however, danazol also decreases the hepatic production of SHBG and therefore SHBG levels, and so downregulation of SHBG may be involved as well. Danazol likely decreases hepatic production of SHBG by reducing estrogenic and increasing androgenic activity in the liver (as androgens and estrogens increase and decrease, respectively, hepatic SHBG synthesis). In accordance {{with the notion that}} suppression of SHBG is involved in the <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> of danazol, the drug has synergistic rather than additive <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> in combination <b>with</b> testosterone in bioassays (which is most likely secondary to the increased free testosterone levels).|$|R
2500|$|Aromatase inhibitors {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} or prevent the estrogenic effects of {{methyltestosterone}} and 5α-reductase inhibitors {{can be used to}} prevent its potentiation in so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues and thereby improve its ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity and reduce its rate of <b>androgenic</b> side <b>effects.</b> Antiandrogens like bicalutamide and cyproterone acetate can block both the anabolic and <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> of AAS like methyltestosterone.|$|R
25|$|DHEA {{and other}} adrenal androgens such as androstenedione, {{although}} relatively weak androgens, {{are responsible for}} the <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> of adrenarche, such as early pubic and axillary hair growth, adult-type body odor, increased oiliness of hair and skin, and mild acne. Women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a non-functional androgen receptor (AR) and are immune to the <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> of DHEA and other androgens, have absent or only sparse/scanty pubic and axillary hair and body hair in general, demonstrating the role of DHEA, testosterone, and other androgens in body hair development at both adrenarche and pubarche.|$|R
30|$|Screening for {{potential}} endocrine activities in fish via estrogenic and androgenic modes of action based on structural alerts provides similar information as in vitro receptor-mediated assays. Additional evidence {{can be obtained}} from in vivo mammalian long-term reproduction studies. Conclusive confirmation is possible with fish life-cycle tests. Application of structural alerts to the more than 33, 000 discrete organic compounds of the EINECS inventory indicated 3585 chemicals (approx. 11 %) as potential candidates for estrogenic and <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> that should be further investigated. Endocrine activities of the remaining substances cannot be excluded; however, because the structural alerts perform much better for <b>substances</b> <b>with</b> (very) high estrogenic and androgenic activities, there is reasonable probability that the most hazardous candidates have been identified.|$|R
25|$|When {{appropriate}} (e.g., {{in women}} of child-bearing age who require contraception), a standard contraceptive pill is frequently {{effective in reducing}} hirsutism. Progestogens such as norgestrel and levonorgestrel should be avoided due to their <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R

50|$|LG-121071 (or LGD-121071) is a {{selective}} androgen receptor modulator (SARM) developed by Ligand Pharmaceuticals that was first described in 1999 {{and was the}} first orally active nonsteroidal androgen to be discovered. It is a tricyclic quinolone derivative, structurally distinct from other nonsteroidal AR agonists like andarine and enobosarm (ostarine). The drug acts as a high-affinity full agonist of the androgen receptor (AR) (Ki = 17 nM), with a potency and efficacy that is said to be equivalent to that of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Unlike testosterone, but similarly to DHT, LG-121071 and other nonsteroidal androgens cannot be potentiated by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues (nor aromatized into estrogenic metabolites), and for this reason, show tissue-selective <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects.</b> In accordance, they are said to possess full anabolic activity <b>with</b> reduced <b>androgenic</b> activity, similarly to anabolic-androgenic steroids.|$|R
25|$|All the {{metabolites}} of dydrogesterone {{retain the}} 4,6-diene-3-one structure, and are metabolically stable. As such, dydrogesterone does not undergo aromatisation, {{which is consistent}} with its absence of estrogenic effects. Furthermore, dydrogesterone does not undergo 17α-hydroxylation, which may contribute to its lack of <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
25|$|NET {{is bound}} to a {{considerable}} extent (36%) to SHBG in circulation. Although it has lower affinity for SHBG than endogenous androgens and estrogens, NET may displace testosterone from SHBG and thereby increase free testosterone levels, and this action may contribute to its weak <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{testosterone}} {{and many}} other anabolic steroids, oxandrolone is less androgenic relative to its strength as an anabolic. This often motivates its medical use in children and women because less <b>androgenic</b> <b>effect</b> implies less risk of virilization. The bodybuilding community also considers this fact when choosing between steroids.|$|R
50|$|New {{pharmaceutical}} therapies {{in clinical}} development include myostatin and the selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs). Nonsteriodal SARMs {{are of particular}} interest, given they exhibit significant selectivity between the anabolic effects of testosterone on muscle, but with little to no evidence of <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> (such as prostate stimulation in men).|$|R
5000|$|... 4-Androstenediol {{is closer}} to {{testosterone}} structurally than 5-androstenediol, and has <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects,</b> acting as a weak partial agonist of the androgen receptor. However, due to its lower intrinsic activity in comparison, {{in the presence of}} full agonists like testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 4-androstenediol has antagonistic actions, behaving more like an antiandrogen.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> such as {{accelerated}} alopecia and acne can appear. In women, drostanolone {{can cause}} virilization {{when used in}} high doses. Drostanolone can also cause a decrease in HDL cholesterol {{and an increase in}} LDL cholesterol. As drostanolone also suppresses natural testosterone production, additional testosterone therapy and post-cycle therapy should be considered.|$|R
50|$|Nandrolone has a {{very high}} ratio of {{anabolic}} to androgenic activity. In fact, nandrolone-like AAS like nandrolone itself and trenbolone {{are said to have}} among the highest ratio of anabolic to <b>androgenic</b> <b>effect</b> of all AAS. This is attributed to the fact that, whereas testosterone is potentiated via conversion into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in androgenic tissues, the opposite is true with nandrolone and similar AAS (i.e., other 19-nortestosterone derivatives). As such, nandrolone-like AAS, namely nandrolone esters, are the most frequently used AAS in clinical settings in which anabolic effects are desired; for instance, in the treatment of AIDS-associated cachexia, severe burns, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, AAS with a very high ratio of anabolic to androgenic action like nandrolone still have significant <b>androgenic</b> <b>effects</b> and can produce symptoms of virilization like hirsutism and voice deepening in women and children with extended use.|$|R
