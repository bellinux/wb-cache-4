40|$|The {{need for}} more drugs to curb the {{increasing}} rise in antibiotic resistant infections has seen an increase in research to discover more antibiotic scaffolds. Polyketides are natural products that can be manipulated to yield a structurally diverse library for drug discovery programs. Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are nano-factories that biosynthesize polyketides in an assembly line fashion making use of two sets of active sites in each module; one set for increasing polyketide chain length and another set for fixing the oxidation state of the β-carbons. Although many strategies exist for the introduction of diversity into polyketide structure, these strategies often result {{in the production of}} unnatural polyketides with reduced yields. The primary factors responsible for this observed reduction in chemical output are substrate selectivity of downstream enzymes and disruption of protein-protein interactions. One strategy, domain inactivation via active site mutagenesis, however, maintains the three dimensional architecture of the PKS and is therefore a much more viable strategy. This strategy is best suited for a PKS in which all or almost all of the modules possess the full complement of tailoring domains. To this end, the genes for the fluvirucin B 1 synthase have been cloned and characterized. The fluvirucin B 1 PKS has five modules, four of which are fatty acid synthase-like and hence represent an ideal system for the domain inactivation strategy. A simple assay to examine the activity of the tailoring domains has also been designed. This assay differs from traditional methods in that it doesn 2 ̆ 7 t require a chain elongation <b>step.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> we have designed an electrophilic β-lactam that reacts specifically with the phosphopantetheine group of holo-ACPs to yield β-keto acyl ACPs which serve as the substrate for the tailoring domain enzymes. A mechanism based fluorescence transfer assay which is very simple, inexpensive and robust has also been developed to investigate the substrate tolerance of KS domains. Together, these new tools will be valuable in providing insights into the mechanism of polyketide biosynthesis and {{go a long way in}} aiding engineering efforts towards the production of polyketides with unnatural structures. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the realization of}} a localization system for a mobile robot relying on monocular vision. The aim of this project {{is to be able}} to make a robot follow a path in autonomous navigation in an urban environment. First, the robot is driven manually. During this learning step, the on board camera records a video sequence. After an off-line processing step, an image taken with the same hardware allows to compute the pose of the robot in real-time. This localization can be used to control the robot and make it follow the same trajectory as in the learning <b>step.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> we build a three dimensional model of the environment (a map) and use this map to localize the robot. The map building step is a structure from motion algorithm. The map is a three dimensional model of the environment made of points. In order to localize the robot, we establish correspondences between the curent image and the 3 D model. This allows to compute the pose of the camera and the robot. Even if the goal {{is to be able to}} localize a vehicle in an urban environment, we have chosen not to make restrictive assumptions on the structure of the scenes. Additionally, the pose computation is done with six degrees of freedom which doesn't limit the usage of the system to vehicles moving on a ground plane. Finally, a large part of this report is dedicated to the performance evaluation of the system. Many experiments in real situations were conducted to evaluate the robustness. The accuracy was measured by comparing the localization computed with the vision algorithm to the ground truth recorded with a differential GPS sensor. Ce mémoire de thèse présente la réalisation d'un système de localisation pour un robot mobile fondé sur la vision monoculaire. L'objectif de ces travaux est de pouvoir faire naviguer un véhicule robotique sur parcours donné en milieu urbain. Le robot est d'abord conduit manuellement.

40|$|The Telecommunication Engineering {{group at}} the University of Twente is {{currently}} working on two projects about phased array antenna systems with photonic beam-formers. One is the SMart Antenna systems for Radio Transceivers (SMART) project. The other is the Broadband Photonic Beamformer project. Some of the advantages of implementing the beam forming network in the optical domain are immunity to electromagnetic interference, high bandwidth and low loss. The optical delays needed for the beamforming are realized with Optical Ring Resonators (ORRs), which can be tuned by varying their parameters. To get higher delay values multiple rings are cascaded and the rings should be tuned {{in such a way that}} the delay ripple is minimal in the frequency band of interest. The goal of the assignment was to design a subsystem which converts a desired set of delay values into a set of optimal ORR parameters. The _rst <b>step</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> was to derive optimality criteria. Three di_erent criteria were the result of this: the delay criterion, phase criterion and power criterion. All of them used a metric value which was the sum of the squared deviation from the target at a certain number of points. Three tuning algorithms followed from those criteria by optimizing for the criteria using Non Linear Programming (NLP) techniques. The phase tuning algorithm was concluded to be best suited to use for the derivation of rules of thumb. This was because negative side e_ects of improper tuning like the rise of side lobes in the radiation pattern are directly dependent on the phase error and the power tuning algorithm gave only slightly better results at the cost of a signi_cant increase in complexity. Since these algorithms were too complex to implement directly into a microcon-troller, rules of thumb were needed. One option was a lookup table, which had severe memory requirements since the 2 kB for a 1 _ 4 OBFN was approaching the limits of the current system. The other option was to store only coe_cients of curve-_tted polyno-mials, which saves a lot of memory at the cost of a little processing time and accuracy. The research also gave solutions for adapting the algorithms when a di_erent ORR response formula is found or when the system needs to be expanded to a 1 _M OBFN. Another result from the research was the delay tuning range covered by a certain number of rings. From that the conclusion was drawn that only three rings were needed in the _rst stage of a 1 _ 8 OBFN instead of four...|$|E

Other designs, such as the continual reassessment method (O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher 1990), use a model to help guide the decision of which dose to give.

These active WGs are usually obtained with electrooptic materials in either the propagating film (core) or the substrate (cladding). In the second case, the WG tunability {{is based on the}} interaction of the active material with the evanescent field of the propagating beam. Liquid crystals (LCs) are an excellent choice as electrooptic active materials since they feature high birefringence, low switching voltage, and relatively simple manufacturing. In this work, we have explored alternative ways to prepare WGs of arbitrary shapes avoiding photolithographic <b>steps.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> we have employed a UV laser unit (Spectra Physics) attached to an xyzCNC system mounted on an optical bench. The laser power is 300 mW, the spot size can be reduced slightly below 1 µm, and the electromechanicalpositioning is well below that number. Different photoresinshave been evaluated for curing time and uniformity; the results have been compared to equivalent WGs realized by standard photolithographic procedures. Best results have been obtained with several kinds of NOA adhesives (Norland Products Inc.) and SU 8 (Microchem). NOA 81 optical adhesive has been employed by several groups for the preparation ofmicrochannels [1] and microfluidic systems[2]. In our case, several NOAs having different refractive indices have been tested in order to optimize light coupling and guiding. The adhesive is spinnedonto a substrate, and a number of segmented WGs are written with the laser system. The laser power is attenuated 20 dB. Then the laser spot is swept a number of times (from 1 to 900) on every segment.

Since association rule mining can be considered as a multiobjective problem, rather than a single objective one, a new multi-objective algorithm for numeric association rule mining is presented in this paper, using Ant Colony Optimization for Continuous domains (ACO R).

40|$|Markov Chain Monte Carlo {{algorithms}} {{are often}} used to sample combinatorial structures such as matchings and independent sets in graphs. A Markov chain is defined whose state space includes the desired sample space, and which has an appropriate stationary distribution. By simulating the chain for a sufficiently large number of steps, we can sample from a distribution arbitrarily close to the stationary distribution. The number of <b>steps</b> required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> {{is known as the}} mixing time of the Markov chain. In this thesis, we consider a number of Markov chains for sampling matchings, both in general and more restricted classes of graphs, and also for sampling independent sets in claw-free graphs. We apply techniques for showing rapid mixing based on two main approaches: coupling and conductance. We consider chains using single-site moves, and also chains using large block moves. Perfect matchings of bipartite graphs are of particular interest in our community. We investigate the mixing time of a Markov chain for sampling perfect matchings in a restricted class of bipartite graphs, and show that its mixing time is exponential in some instances. For a further restricted class of graphs, however, we can show subexponential mixing time. One of the techniques for showing rapid mixing is coupling. The bound on the mixing time depends on a contraction ratio b. Ideally, b < 1, but in the case b = 1 it is still possible to obtain a bound on the mixing time, provided there is a sufficiently large probability of contraction for all pairs of states. We develop a lemma which obtains better bounds on the mixing time in this case than existing theorems, in the case where b = 1 and the probability of a change in distance is proportional to the distance between the two states. We apply this lemma to the Dyer-Greenhill chain for sampling independent sets, and to a Markov chain for sampling 2 D-colourings. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Results: FGM was reported to be known by 327 (38. 5 %) of the interviewees. The majority (n = 249, 76. 1 %) reported that local healers were the main performers of FGM, and 258 (78. 9 %) respondents stated that the clitoris was the part removed during circumcision. The main reason for the practice of FGM was reduction of female sexual hyperactivity (reported by 198 women [60. 3 %]). Circumcision of daughters was reported by 288 (88. 1 %) respondents, and this showed a statistically significant association with the Christian religion (P = 0. 003), illiteracy (P = 0. 01), and Amhara ethnicity (P = 0. 012). The majority of the respondents (792, 92. 3 %) were themselves circumcised and 68. 8 % did not know of any health-related problems associated with FGM. Conclusion: In spite of FGM being a common practice in the study area, only one third of the respondents stated that they knew about it. Local healers were the main performers of FGM. Some of the women knew about the negative reproductive health effects of FGM and some had also experienced these themselves. However, only a few had tried to stop the practice and the majority had taken no <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. <b>This</b> may be attributable to the fear of becoming alienated from the cultural system and fear of isolation.

60|$|The disillusionment about {{marriage}} which had discovered Trafford a thwarted, overworked, and worried man, had revealed Marjorie with time on her hands, superabundant imaginative energy, and no clear intimation of any occupation. With them, as {{with thousands of}} young couples in London to-day, the breadwinner was overworked, and the spending partner's duty was chiefly the negative one of not spending. You cannot consume your energies merely in not spending money. Do what she could, Marjorie could not contrive to make house and child fill the waking hours. She was far too active and irritable a being to be beneficial company all day for genial, bubble-blowing little Margharita; she could play with that young lady and lead her into ecstasies of excitement and delight, {{and she could see}} with an almost instinctive certainty when anything was going wrong; but for the rest that little life reposed far more beneficially upon the passive acquiescence of May, her pink and wholesome nurse. And the household generally was {{in the hands of a}} trustworthy cook-general, who maintained a tolerable routine. Marjorie <b>did</b> not dare <b>to</b> have an idea about food or domestic arrangements; if she touched that routine so much as with her little finger it sent up the bills. She could knock off butcher and greengrocer and do every scrap of household work that she could touch, in a couple of hours a day. She tried to find some work to fill her leisure; she suggested to Trafford that she might help him by writing up his Science Notes from rough pencil memoranda, but when it became clear that the first <b>step</b> <b>to</b> her <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> would be the purchase of a Remington typewriter and a special low table to carry it, he became bluntly discouraging. She thought of literary work, and sat down one day to write a short story and earn guineas, and was surprised to find that she knew nothing of any sort of human being about whom she could invent a story. She tried a cheap subscription at Mudie's and novels, and they filled her with a thirst for events; she tried needlework, and found her best efforts aesthetically feeble and despicable, and that her mind prowled above the silks and colours like a hungry wolf.|$|R
5000|$|The {{graphics}} of {{the original}} game are extremely simple by today's standards; most of the screen is occupied by text, with about 10% devoted to a first-person view of the dungeon maze using high-resolution line graphics. By {{the standards of the}} day, however, the graphics improved on the text-only games that had been far more common. When monsters are encountered, the dungeon maze disappears, replaced by a picture of one of the monsters. Combat is against from 1 to 4 groups of monsters. The game's lack of an automap feature, which had not been invented {{at the time of its}} release, practically forces the player to draw the map for each level on graph paper (included in the box) as he walks through the 20x20 dungeon maze, step by <b>step</b> - failing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> often results in becoming permanently lost, as there are many locations in the maze that have a permanent [...] "Darkness" [...] spell upon the square (making the player walk blindly) or a [...] "Teleport" [...] spell sending the player to a new location. A magic spell can be used to determine the current location of the party, and at higher levels there is a teleport spell that can be used to quickly transition between the maze levels. Care is necessary when teleporting as the player must enter both the level and coordinates to teleport to (the number of steps north, south, east, or west from his current location) and it is easily possible to land in a trap or solid stone, ending the game. The original releases of Wizardry also do not announce that the player has teleported and play resumes as if one step forward was taken.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern among {{national}} governments to include Civic education in their curriculums. This is because Civic education plays an indispensable role in creating awareness among the citizens about their rights and responsibilities. Ethiopia too commencing its transition to democracy has taken significant <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. In <b>this</b> regard one of the significant departures of the EPRDF government from its predecessors in terms of curriculum reform is the inclusion of Civic education in tertiary education. The study shed light to assess the role of Civic education in shaping students attitude in terms of appropriate service provision good governance tolerance of diversity and others. Using sample respondents of 201 students randomly selected from the three universities namely Arba Minch Wolayta Sodo and Hawassa universities generalizations were deduced. The facts drawn from both the qualitative and quantitative surveys indicated that Civic education is playing a crucial role for cultivating informed reasonable and active citizens and the subsequent building of constitutional democracy in Ethiopia. The study indicated that the problems related to good governance in the various government offices are not the result of lack of the required skills but {{due to the lack of}} Civic knowledge. The Civic dispositions that build the citizens traits are not inherited and as such every new generation is required to acquire the knowledge learn the skills and develop the dispositions or traits of private and public character that undergird a constitutional democracy. Civic education therefore is-or should be-a prime concern. There is no more important task than the development of an informed effective and responsible citizenry. Democracies are sustained by citizens who have the requisite knowledge skills and dispositions. In the absence a reasoned commitment on the part of its citizens to the fundamental values and principles of democracy a free and open society cannot succeed. It is imperative therefore that educators policymakers and members of civil society make the case and ask for the support of civic education from all segments of society and from the widest range of institutions and government...|$|R

It lived a rapid opening toward international market on the very early stage of this new era {{and the establishment of}} democracy model of state. The huge differences in development, education, perception and experience induced rapidly a system of market exchange deeply in favor of imports in front of exports. Even several steps, important ones, done on the improvement of the balance projecting and designing a market development law reform, as well as policies fostering domestic market development and the stimulation of exports versus imports, still our economy lacks a lot in this matter.

The accession to WTO, the several multilateral agreements, regional and international, Albania signed and participates, as well as the bilateral agreement with EU on the free trade for the genuine products and the signature of SAA and the process of EU integration, made it impossible that Albania could face international market exchanges with that very latent philosophy and approach on development of the very first years of market economy, and the situation on imports and exports has deepen the advantage of the first versus the second.
