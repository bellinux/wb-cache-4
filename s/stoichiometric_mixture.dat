25|$|This {{method of}} {{detonation}} produces energies over 100keV (~109 K temperatures), suitable {{not only for}} nuclear fusion, but other higher-order quantum reactions as well. The UTIAS explosive-driven-implosion facility was used to produce stable, centered and focused hemispherical implosions to generate neutrons from D–D reactions. The simplest and most direct method proved {{to be in a}} predetonated <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>mixture</b> of deuterium and oxygen. The other successful method was using a miniature Voitenko-type compressor, where a plane diaphragm was driven by the implosion wave into a secondary small spherical cavity that contained pure deuterium gas at one atmosphere. In brief, PETN solid explosive is used to form a hemispherical shell (3–6mm thick) in a 20-cm diameter hemispherical cavity milled in a massive steel chamber. The remaining volume is filled with a <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>mixture</b> of (H2 or D2 and O2). This mixture is detonated by a very short thin exploding wire located at the geometric center. The arrival of the detonation wave at the spherical surface instantly and simultaneously fires the explosive liner. The detonation wave in the explosive liner hits the metal cavity, reflects, and implodes on the preheated burnt gases, focuses {{at the center of the}} hemisphere (50microseconds after the initiation of the exploding wire) and reflects, leaving behind a very small pocket (1mm) of extremely high-temperature, high-pressure and high-density plasma.|$|E

40|$|A small {{library of}} stereoisomeric pseudopeptides {{able to make}} gels in {{different}} solvents has been prepared and their attitude to make gels {{in the presence of}} several metal ions was evaluated. Four benzyl esters and four carboxylic acids, all containing a moiety of azelaic acid (a long chain dicarboxylic acid) coupled with four different pseudopeptide moieties sharing the same skeleton (a phenyl group one atom apart from the oxazolidin- 2 -one carboxylic group), were synthesized in solution, by standard coupling reaction. The tendency of these pseudopeptides to form gels was evaluated using the inversion test of 10 mM solutions of pure compounds and of <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>mixtures</b> of pseudopeptides and metal ions. To obtain additional information on the molecular association, the gel samples were left dry in the air to form xerogels that were further analyzed using SEM and XRD. The formation of gel containing Zn(II) or Cu(II) ions gave good results in term of incorporation of the metal ions, while the presence of Cu(I), Al(III) and Mg(II) gave less satisfactory results.
