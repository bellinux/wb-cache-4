Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E

Feng later told All Girls Allowed, an American group campaigning against the one-child policy, [...] "I could feel the baby jumping around inside me all the time, but then she went still." [...] She had been seven months pregnant at the time, so the abortion, voluntary or not, was illegal under Chinese law. No family members were allowed to be present for the procedure. After the child died of hypoxia, Feng underwent induced labor and delivered a stillborn girl on June 4. Feng later told All Girls Allowed: [...] "It was much more painful than my first childbirth.

Kelly revealed that she felt Steve was the best man for Becky over her previous lover Jason, stating: [...] "Both boys bring out different things in Becky. With Jason, they liked going clubbing, {{and it was no}} strings attached, I think Becky needs more than that, even though she wouldn't admit it. I think, long-term, Steve's better for her." [...] When Gregson was interviewed by entertainment website Digital Spy, he was asked if he thought that his character has had a positive impact on Becky's life. In reply he stated: [...] "I think he's turned it around. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> over the place getting into trouble all the time but he's made her grow up. And having a little girl there in Amy, that's made her grow a bit, too. She's got responsibilities now. She's besotted with him. She's still a total pisshead, though!" [...] Steve and Becky attempted to marry twice in 2009; their first wedding was given a promotional push from ITV, which aired adverts for the first wedding episodes.
