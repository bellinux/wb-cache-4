5|$|Beorhtwulf and his wife, Sæthryth, {{may have}} had two sons, Beorhtfrith and Beorhtric. Beorhtric is known from {{witnessing}} his father's charters, but he ceased to do <b>so</b> <b>before</b> the end of Beorhtwulf's reign. Beorhtfrith appears in later sources which describe his murder of Wigstan, the grandson of Wiglaf, {{in a dispute over}} Beorhtfrith's plan to marry Wigstan's widowed mother Ælfflæd. Beorhtwulf's death is not recorded in any surviving sources, but it is thought that he died in 852.|$|E

5|$|On 20 December 2005, Minister for Justice Michael McDowell {{announced}} that he was creating a working group in the Department of Justice to provide options for government consideration. This announcement came on the day after Belfast in Northern Ireland held the first of the new UK civil partnership registration ceremonies.

5|$|The Charolais breed was small, {{and most}} closely {{physically}} resembled the Morvan horse, another now-extinct French type. The breed {{had a short}} head with small ears and a short, strong neck attached low on the shoulder. The body was short and rounded, with a broad croup and strong legs. They were {{generally considered to be}} small and inelegant. They were strong, robust and hardy, the last of these traits especially <b>so</b> <b>before</b> the breeding changes of the 19th century, and were known for their pulling power.|$|E

5|$|Dario Šimić was Croatia's {{first player}} to reach 100 appearances, doing <b>so</b> <b>before</b> his {{retirement}} in 2008. This allowed him to surpass Robert Jarni's previous record of 81 appearances. On 6 February 2013, captain Darijo Srna, Josip Šimunić and Stipe Pletikosa each also played their 100th cap for Croatia in a 4–0 friendly victory over South Korea in London. The trio went on to set a new joint-record of 101 appearances for the national team on 22 March 2013 in a World Cup qualifying victory against Serbia in Zagreb. Srna eventually surpassed his teammates and accrued 134 international caps for Croatia. Ivica Olić has since also appeared 104 times for Croatia, with his 100th cap coming against Italy at San Siro on 16 November 2014.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} battle had ended, a severe gale struck the area. Several of the {{captured}} French and Spanish ships foundered in the rising seas, including both of Temeraires prizes, the Fougueux and the Redoutable. Lost in the wrecks were {{a considerable number of}} their crews, as well as 47 Temeraire crewmen, serving as prize crews. Temeraire rode out the storm following the battle, sometimes being taken in tow by less damaged ships, sometimes riding at anchor. She took aboard a number of Spanish and French prisoners transferred from other prizes, including some transferred from the Euryalus, which was serving as the temporary flagship of Cuthbert Collingwood, who was now in command as Nelson had been killed during the battle. Harvey took the opportunity to go aboard the Euryalus and present his account of the battle to Collingwood, and so became the only captain to do <b>so</b> <b>before</b> Collingwood wrote his dispatch about the victory.|$|E
5|$|Two {{wild animal}} taxa {{are unique to}} St Kilda: the St Kilda wren (Troglodytes troglodytes hirtensis), which is a {{subspecies}} of the Eurasian wren, and a subspecies of wood mouse known as the St Kilda field mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus hirtensis). A third taxon endemic to St Kilda, a subspecies of house mouse known as the St Kilda house mouse (Mus musculus muralis), vanished completely after the departure of human inhabitants, as it was strictly associated with settlements and buildings. It {{had a number of}} traits in common with a sub-species (Mus musculus mykinessiensis) found on Mykines island in the Faroe Islands. The grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) now breeds on Hirta but did not do <b>so</b> <b>before</b> the 1930 evacuation.|$|E
5|$|In 814, Wulfred {{travelled}} to Rome {{to visit}} Pope Leo III. Although {{the exact nature}} of his business with the pope is unknown, it was likely connected with the issue that arose between the archbishop and Coenwulf over lay control of monasteries. He was accompanied by the bishop of Sherborne, Wigberht. Laymen controlling monasteries had been customary for centuries, though in the half-century or <b>so</b> <b>before</b> Wulfred became archbishop the church had begun to assert control over monasteries. In England, this attempt to secure control was manifested in decrees made by synods at Clofesho in 803 and more especially the synod of Chelsea in 816. Tensions over the Kentish monastic houses of Reculver and Minster-in-Thanet reached such a point that Wulfred was deprived of authority by the king for a period of some years; six according to the document drawn up in 825 recording the– then victorious– Canterbury view of the debate, though four is perhaps more likely. Wulfred still witnessed documents as archbishop in 817, and by September 822, he was once more officiating as archbishop, when he consecrated King Ceolwulf of Mercia. Wulfred was driven into exile briefly at some point during his suspension from office. However, the dispute was still active {{in the last years of}} Coenwulf's reign, as at a council held perhaps in 821, the king threatened the archbishop with exile unless he yielded. Wulfred and the Canterbury community fought Coenwulf vigorously, sending embassies to the pope and concocting forgeries in their favour which purported to have been issued by earlier kings.|$|E

5|$|Liz first {{appears in}} the episode airing on October 3, 2001, {{as the owner of}} the unnamed resort on the fictional island of St. Lisa's, located near Bermuda and the Bermuda Triangle. She helps her former boyfriend Brian O'Leary rescue Sheridan Crane {{following}} the explosion of her boat. Along with Brian, and their friend Doc, Liz becomes close with the amnesiac Sheridan while trying to help her to remember her past. Sheridan believes her name is Diana due to confusing memories of her friendship with Diana, Princess of Wales with her own; she begins a romantic relationship with Brian. Liz grows increasingly jealous of the attention Brian pays to Diana and suspicious of Brian's true identity. Liz forms a close friendship with Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald after he comes to the island to pick up a boat for his then girlfriend Beth Wallace. She thinks Luis is Diana's fiancée, but fails to reunite them, despite several attempts, before he returns home. Liz joins Diana and Brian to sail the ship back to the fictional town of Harmony. Upon returning to Harmony on Christmas Eve, Brian reveals his identity as Antonio Lopez-Fitzgerald, the long lost brother of Luis, and Liz and Diana convince him to reunite with his family. Liz again attempts to reunite Diana with Luis, but fails to do <b>so</b> <b>before</b> they return to St. Lisa's Island.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} cargo {{offloaded}} at Karachi, 8,700 bales of raw cotton were loaded, along with various quantities of fish manure, resin, rice, scrap iron, sulphur, and timber. Added to this were 1,000 barrels of lubricating oil. The ship's captain {{was concerned about}} having to take the flammable items but was told {{that they had to}} go. A proposal to add 750 drums of turpentine was refused. The ship's officers also expressed concerns over mixing the cargoes of cotton and the oil and explosives, but were unable to find paperwork that advised against this practice. In 1942, the United States Government had published a book which advised against the carriage of raw cotton. A common myth at the time was that wet cotton bales could spontaneously combust. This was not the case, although cotton soaked in oil would readily do <b>so.</b> <b>Before</b> the ship sailed, the crew discovered that the barrels of lubricating oil leaked. Tarpaulins were nailed over the lower hold covers and the firefighting equipment on board was thoroughly tested. Extra fire drills were scheduled during the voyage to Karachi. Fort Stikine sailed on 9 April to join Convoy PB74, which had departed from Bandar Abbas, Iran on 6 April. The unescorted convoy arrived at Bombay on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|Wetherall {{was one of}} 19 senior first-team {{players to}} be laid off by {{chairman}} Richmond in May 2002, after the club were put into administration and the players unpaid since April. Those players {{went as far as}} taking strike action before a pre-season friendly at Hull City, even though Wetherall, as their Professional Footballers' Association representative, had initially denied they would do <b>so,</b> <b>before</b> the club was saved and players reinstated. Wetherall played in the club's opening game of the season as Bradford drew 0–0 with Wolverhampton Wanderers live on television, but was again ruled out through an injury, this time to his hip. A planned comeback was put off five weeks later, before he sought the advice of a specialist in Denmark. After sitting out another three months through injury, Wetherall made his return as a substitute against Gillingham in December 2002 but was again injured in a reserve team comeback three days later. He again returned in February 2003 against Coventry City and played 15 games during the final three months of the season.|$|E
