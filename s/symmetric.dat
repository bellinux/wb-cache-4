5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the least}} <b>symmetric</b> curve of constant width according to two different measures of central asymmetry, the Kovner–Besicovitch measure (ratio of area to the largest centrally <b>symmetric</b> shape enclosed by the curve) and the Estermann measure (ratio of area to the smallest centrally <b>symmetric</b> shape enclosing the curve). For the Reuleaux triangle, the two centrally <b>symmetric</b> shapes that determine the measures of asymmetry are both hexagonal, although the inner one has curved sides. The Reuleaux triangle has diameters that split its area more unevenly than any other curve of constant width. That is, the maximum ratio of areas {{on either side of}} a diameter, another measure of asymmetry, is bigger for the Reuleaux triangle than for other curves of constant width.|$|E
5|$|A <b>symmetric</b> {{multiprocessor}} (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such <b>symmetric</b> multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E
5|$|For random {{walks in}} -dimensional integer lattices, George Pólya {{published}} in 1919 and 1921 work, {{where he studied}} {{the probability of a}} <b>symmetric</b> random walk returning to a previous position in the lattice. Pólya showed that a <b>symmetric</b> random walk, which has an equal probability to advance in any direction in the lattice, will return to a previous position in the lattice an infinite number of times with probability one in one and two dimensions, but with probability zero in three or higher dimensions.|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetry}} {{on earth}} mirrors the <b>symmetric</b> perfection of heaven. The purpose {{of art at}} this time—in architecture, the visual arts, and music—was not to create something entirely new, but to reflect this divine perfection, {{and in this way}} to praise God. We find such a <b>symmetric</b> outline in many pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach,19 but only in a few cases is this outline as consequent as in the B Minor Mass. The parts Kyrie, Gloria and Credo are all designed with choral sections as the outer movements, framing an intimate center of theological significance.|$|E
25|$|The {{power sum}} <b>symmetric</b> {{functions}} p'k, for any positive integer k; one has p'k=m(k), the monomial <b>symmetric</b> function for the monomial X1k. This <b>symmetric</b> function {{corresponds to the}} power sum <b>symmetric</b> polynomial p'k(X1,,X'n)=X1k++X'n'k for any n1.|$|E
25|$|This <b>symmetric</b> {{function}} {{corresponds to}} the monomial <b>symmetric</b> polynomial m(X1,,X'n) for any n large enough to have the monomial X. The distinct monomial <b>symmetric</b> functions are parametrized by the integer partitions (each m has a unique representative monomial X with the parts i in weakly decreasing order). Since any <b>symmetric</b> function containing any of the monomials of some m must contain all of them with the same coefficient, each <b>symmetric</b> function can be written as an R-linear combination of monomial <b>symmetric</b> functions, and the distinct monomial <b>symmetric</b> functions therefore form a basis of R as R-module.|$|E
25|$|The Newton identities also permit {{expressing the}} {{elementary}} <b>symmetric</b> polynomials {{in terms of}} the power sum <b>symmetric</b> polynomials, showing that any <b>symmetric</b> polynomial can also be expressed in the power sums. In fact the first n power sums also form an algebraic basis for the space of <b>symmetric</b> polynomials.|$|E
25|$|The <b>symmetric</b> {{group has}} two 1-dimensional {{representation}}s: the trivial representation and the sign representation. The <b>symmetric</b> polynomials are the trivial representation, and the alternating polynomials are the sign representation. Formally, the scalar span of any <b>symmetric</b> (resp., alternating) polynomial is a trivial (resp., sign) {{representation of the}} <b>symmetric</b> group, and multiplying the polynomials tensors the representations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Symmetric</b> polynomials arise {{naturally}} {{in the study}} of the relation between the roots of a polynomial in one variable and its coefficients, since the coefficients can be given by polynomial expressions in the roots, and all roots play a similar role in this setting. From this point of view the elementary <b>symmetric</b> polynomials are the most fundamental <b>symmetric</b> polynomials. A theorem states that any <b>symmetric</b> polynomial can be expressed in terms of elementary <b>symmetric</b> polynomials, which implies that every <b>symmetric</b> polynomial expression in the roots of a monic polynomial can alternatively be given as a polynomial expression in the coefficients of the polynomial.|$|E
25|$|A {{relation}} that is reflexive, <b>symmetric,</b> and transitive {{is called}} an equivalence relation. A relation that is <b>symmetric,</b> transitive, and serial is also reflexive. A relation {{that is only}} <b>symmetric</b> and transitive (without necessarily being reflexive) is called a partial equivalence relation.|$|E
25|$|The Merkulov–Schwachhöfer {{classification}} {{has been}} clarified considerably by {{a connection between}} the groups on the list and certain <b>symmetric</b> spaces, namely the hermitian <b>symmetric</b> spaces and the quaternion-Kähler <b>symmetric</b> spaces. The relationship is particularly clear in the case of complex affine holonomies, as demonstrated by Schwachhöfer (2001).|$|E
25|$|If G is a non-bipartite <b>symmetric</b> graph, {{the double}} cover of G {{is also a}} <b>symmetric</b> graph; several known cubic <b>symmetric</b> graphs may be {{obtained}} in this way. For instance, the double cover of K4 is the graph of a cube; the double cover of the Petersen graph is the Desargues graph; and the double cover of the graph of the dodecahedron is a 40-vertex <b>symmetric</b> cubic graph.|$|E
25|$|In algebra and in {{particular}} in algebraic combinatorics, the ring of <b>symmetric</b> functions is a specific limit of the rings of <b>symmetric</b> polynomials in n indeterminates, as n goes to infinity. This ring serves as universal structure in which relations between <b>symmetric</b> polynomials can be expressed in a way independent of the number n of indeterminates (but its elements are neither polynomials nor functions). Among other things, this ring {{plays an important role}} in the representation theory of the <b>symmetric</b> group.|$|E
25|$|If A is <b>symmetric</b> and , then A is {{necessarily}} bounded. That is to say, an unbounded <b>symmetric</b> operator cannot be defined {{on the whole}} Hilbert space. Since the operators considered in quantum mechanics are unbounded, {{it is impossible to}} define them as <b>symmetric</b> operators on the whole Hilbert space.|$|E
25|$|If R {{contains}} the fieldQ of rational numbers, it applies {{also to the}} family (p'i)i>0 of power sum <b>symmetric</b> functions. This explains why the first n elements {{of each of these}} families define sets of <b>symmetric</b> polynomials in n variables that are free polynomial generators of that ring of <b>symmetric</b> polynomials.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, Venn {{diagrams}} {{were further}} developed. D.W.Henderson showed in 1963 {{that the existence}} of an n-Venn diagram with n-fold rotational symmetry implied that n was a prime number. He also showed that such <b>symmetric</b> Venn diagrams exist when n is 5 or 7. In 2002 Peter Hamburger found <b>symmetric</b> Venn diagrams for n = 11 and in 2003, Griggs, Killian, and Savage showed that <b>symmetric</b> Venn diagrams exist for all other primes. Thus rotationally <b>symmetric</b> Venn diagrams exist if and only if n is a prime number.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>symmetric</b> semigroup (of all transformations) {{one also}} finds a weaker, non-unique notion of inverse (called a pseudoinverse) because the <b>symmetric</b> semigroup {{is a regular}} semigroup.|$|E
25|$|Specifically, for n = 2 (a {{projective}} line), {{all points}} are collinear, so the collineation group {{is exactly the}} <b>symmetric</b> group of the points of the projective line, and except for F2 and F3 (where PGL is the full <b>symmetric</b> group), PGL is a proper subgroup of the full <b>symmetric</b> group on these points.|$|E
25|$|Synapses may be {{described}} as <b>symmetric</b> or asymmetric. When examined under an electron microscope, asymmetric synapses are characterized by rounded vesicles in the presynaptic cell, and a prominent postsynaptic density. Asymmetric synapses are typically excitatory. <b>Symmetric</b> synapses in contrast have flattened or elongated vesicles, and do not contain a prominent postsynaptic density. <b>Symmetric</b> synapses are typically inhibitory.|$|E
25|$|That is, {{the ring}} of <b>symmetric</b> and {{alternating}} polynomials is a quadratic extension of {{the ring of}} <b>symmetric</b> polynomials, where one has adjoined a square root of the discriminant.|$|E
25|$|If , {{there are}} also other subrepresentations of {{the action of the}} <b>symmetric</b> group on the ring of polynomials, as {{discussed}} in representation theory of the <b>symmetric</b> group.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows from}} the {{equation}} that the hyperbola is <b>symmetric</b> with respect to both of the coordinate axes and hence <b>symmetric</b> {{with respect to the}} origin.|$|E
25|$|For example, when {{estimating}} {{a location}} parameter, for a <b>symmetric</b> distribution a <b>symmetric</b> L-estimator (such as the median or midhinge) will be unbiased. However, if the distribution has skew, <b>symmetric</b> L-estimators will generally be biased and require adjustment. For example, in a skewed distribution, the nonparametric skew (and Pearson's skewness coefficients) measure the bias of the median as an estimator of the mean.|$|E
25|$|The entries of a <b>symmetric</b> matrix are <b>symmetric</b> {{with respect}} to the main diagonal. So if the entries are written as A = (a'ij), then a'ij = aji, for all indices i and j.|$|E
25|$|A partial {{equivalence}} relation is transitive and <b>symmetric.</b> Transitive and <b>symmetric</b> imply reflexive if {{and only if}} for all a ∈ X, there exists a b ∈ X such that a ~ b.|$|E
25|$|Any {{subgroup}} of a <b>symmetric</b> group {{is called a}} permutation group. By Cayley's theorem any group is isomorphic to some permutation group, and every finite group to a {{subgroup of}} some finite <b>symmetric</b> group.|$|E
25|$|We {{see that}} there is a {{bijection}} between <b>symmetric</b> extensions of an operator and isometric extensions of its Cayley transform. The <b>symmetric</b> extension is self-adjoint if and only if the corresponding isometric extension is unitary.|$|E
25|$|In {{deriving}} the Schwarzschild metric, it {{was assumed}} that the metric was vacuum, spherically <b>symmetric</b> and static. In fact, the static assumption is stronger than required, as Birkhoff's theorem states that any spherically <b>symmetric</b> vacuum solution of Einstein's field equations is stationary; then one obtains the Schwarzschild solution. Birkhoff's theorem has the consequence that any pulsating star which remains spherically <b>symmetric</b> cannot generate gravitational waves (as the region exterior to the star must remain static).|$|E
25|$|The case of {{equality}} in Fisher's inequality, that is, a 2-design {{with an equal}} number of points and blocks, is called a <b>symmetric</b> design. <b>Symmetric</b> designs have the smallest number of blocks amongst all the 2-designs with the same number of points.|$|E
25|$|In <b>symmetric</b> {{unimodal}} distributions, such as {{the normal}} distribution, the mean (if defined), median and mode all coincide. For samples, if {{it is known that}} they are drawn from a <b>symmetric</b> distribution, the sample mean can be used as an estimate of the population mode.|$|E
25|$|The <b>symmetric</b> {{group is}} {{important}} to diverse areas of mathematics such as Galois theory, invariant theory, the representation theory of Lie groups, and combinatorics. Cayley's theorem states that every group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the <b>symmetric</b> group on G.|$|E
25|$|<b>Symmetric</b> {{spin and}} <b>symmetric</b> under parity. In this case, the {{exchange}} of the two nucleons will multiply the deuterium wavefunction by (−1) from isospin exchange, (+1) from spin exchange and (+1) from parity (location exchange), {{for a total of}} (−1) as needed for antisymmetry.|$|E
25|$|Poincaré {{separation}} theorem: {{gives the}} upper and lower bounds of eigenvalues of a real <b>symmetric</b> matrix B'AB that can be considered as the orthogonal projection of a larger real <b>symmetric</b> matrix A onto a linear subspace spanned by the columns of B.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} are fundamental examples of <b>symmetric</b> functions.|$|E
25|$|Each can be visualized as <b>symmetric</b> orthographic {{projections}} in Coxeter {{planes of}} the A4 Coxeter group, and other subgroups. Three Coxeter plane 2D projections are given, for the A4, A3, A2 Coxeter groups, showing symmetry order 5,4,3, and doubled on even Ak orders to 10,4,6 for <b>symmetric</b> Coxeter diagrams.|$|E
25|$|In {{the physics}} {{literature}}, the term Hermitian {{is used in}} place of the term <b>symmetric.</b> It should be noted, however, that the physics literature generally glosses over the distinction between operators that are merely <b>symmetric</b> and operators that are actually self-adjoint (as defined in the next section).|$|E
