The classical approach of splitting the flow into primary and secondary flow fields is employed and extended to include effects of viscosity, rotation, and density stratification.

The secondary flow field is obtained by solving a Poisson equation using a successive over-relaxation method. The results are compared with theoretical and experimental data from <b>stationary</b> ducts, <b>compressor</b> and turbine cascades. The agreement is good for most of the cases...|$|R
25|$|Incinerators {{reduce the}} solid {{mass of the}} {{original}} waste by 80–85% and the volume (already compressed somewhat in garbage trucks) by 95–96%, depending on composition and degree of recovery of materials such as metals from the ash for recycling. This means that while incineration does not completely replace landfilling, it significantly reduces the necessary volume for disposal. Garbage trucks often reduce the volume of waste in a built-in compressor before delivery to the incinerator. Alternatively, at landfills, {{the volume of the}} uncompressed garbage can be reduced by approximately 70% by using a <b>stationary</b> steel <b>compressor,</b> albeit with a significant energy cost.

Market pressure within the aero industry, and the changing requirement of airline operators, motivates considerable effort to continuously improve {{the design of the}} modem day gas turbine. Fundamental to the development programme of a new gas turbine is the monitoring of vibrations of the engine during its development tests. This entails manual inspection and interpretation of thousands of diagrams depicting the vibration history observed by several hundred strain gauge transducers, located on rotating and <b>stationary</b> <b>compressor</b> blades. This thesis describes an Expert System, developed during a three year research contract (co-funded by Rolls-Royce and SERC), that has been devised to assist in the analysis task. Features, depicting various forms of vibration phenomena, are located on each diagram by image processing techniques and interpreted by stored engineering knowledge representing the experience of vibration engineers. Thus, the system is capable of scrutinising vibration data, obtained from engine tests, and classifying that data as acceptable or in need of further study.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{gas turbine}} engine was destroyed {{as a result of}} the combustion of its titanium components. It was concluded that a severe surge may have caused interference between rotating and <b>stationary</b> <b>compressor</b> parts that either directly or indirectly ignited the titanium components. Several engine oil samples (before and after the failure) were analyzed with a Ferrograph, and with plasma, atomic absorption, and emission spectrometers to see if this information would aid in the engine failure diagnosis. The analyses indicated that a lubrication system failure was not a causative factor in the engine failure. Neither an abnormal wear mechanism nor a high level of wear debris was detected in the engine oil sample taken just prior to the test in which the failure occurred. However, low concentrations (0. 2 to 0. 5 ppm) of titanium were evident in this sample and samples taken earlier. After the failure, higher titanium concentrations (2 ppm) were detected in oil samples taken from different engine locations. Ferrographic analysis indicated that most of the titanium was contained in spherical metallic debris after the failure. The oil analyses eliminated a lubrication system bearing or shaft seal failure as the cause of the engine failure. Previously announced in STAR as N 83 - 1243...|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of ice accretion within commercial high bypass aircraft turbine engines {{has been reported}} under certain atmospheric conditions. Engine anomalies have taken place at high altitudes that {{have been attributed to}} ice crystal ingestion, partially melting, and ice accretion on the compression system components. The result was degraded engine performance, and {{one or more of the}} following: loss of thrust control (roll back), compressor surge or stall, and flameout of the combustor. As ice crystals are ingested into the fan and low pressure compression system, the increase in air temperature causes a portion of the ice crystals to melt. It is hypothesized that this allows the ice-water mixture to cover the metal surfaces of the <b>compressor</b> <b>stationary</b> components which leads to ice accretion through evaporative cooling. Ice accretion causes a blockage which subsequently results in the deterioration in performance of the compressor and engine. The focus of this research is to apply an engine icing computational tool to simulate the flow through a turbofan engine and assess the risk of ice accretion. The tool is comprised of an engine system thermodynamic cycle code, a compressor flow analysis code, and an ice particle melt code that has the capability of determining the rate of sublimation, melting, and evaporation through the compressor flow path, without modeling the actual ice accretion. A commercial turbofan engine which has previously experienced icing events during operation in a high altitude ice crystal environment has been tested in the Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL) altitude test facility at NASA Glenn Research Center. The PSL has the capability to produce a continuous ice cloud which are ingested by the engine during operation over a range of altitude conditions. The PSL test results confirmed that there was ice accretion in the engine due to ice crystal ingestion, at the same simulated altitude operating conditions as experienced previously in flight. The computational tool was utilized to help guide a portion of the PSL testing, and was used to predict ice accretion could also occur at significantly lower altitudes. The predictions were qualitatively verified by subsequent testing of the engine in the PSL. The PSL test has helped to calibrate the engine icing computational tool to assess the risk of ice accretion. The results from the computer simulation identified prevalent trends in wet bulb temperature, ice particle melt ratio, and engine inlet temperature as a function of altitude for predicting engine icing risk due to ice crystal ingestion...|$|R
