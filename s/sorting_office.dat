5|$|On 19 July, {{security}} forces {{carried out a}} controlled explosion on a bomb left at Ealing Broadway station and public transport was disrupted when the Metropolitan Police closed Victoria and Paddington train stations and halted services on the London Underground. On 21 September a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at the MI6 headquarters using an RPG-22 rocket launcher, which generated headlines around the world. On 21 February 2001 a bomb disguised as a torch (flashlight) left outside a Territorial Army base in Shepherd's Bush seriously injured a 14-year-old cadet, who was blinded and had his hand blown off. A second attack in Shepherd's Bush, the 4 March BBC bombing, injured a civilian outside the BBC Television Centre. The explosion was captured by a BBC cameraman, and the footage was broadcast on TV stations worldwide, and gained mass publicity for the group. On 14 April a bomb exploded at a postal <b>sorting</b> <b>office</b> in Hendon, causing minor damage but no injuries. Three weeks later on 6 May a second bomb exploded at the same building, causing slight injuries to a passer-by. The 3 August Ealing bombing injured seven people, and on 3 November a car bomb containing 60lb of home-made explosives was planted in the centre of Birmingham. The bomb did not fully detonate {{and no one was}} injured.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} was constructed between 1889—1891 and operated as the city's {{head post office}} until the 1972 when administrative and <b>sorting</b> <b>office</b> facilities were moved to a new, larger building on Severn Street (since rebuilt as The Mailbox). There were plans to demolish the building in 1973; however after a seven-year campaign by The Victorian Society it was saved. In 1989 the former <b>sorting</b> <b>office</b> was demolished and in 1991 an office development was opened with the former public counter building forming its entrance lobby.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s {{the evening}} trams from Whitefield and Manchester had a {{letterbox}} fitted to their fronts, enabling letters to be posted at the tram stops {{in time to}} reach the last post collection at Manchester post <b>sorting</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E

25|$|Eddington Farm was on Eddington Lane {{and next}} to Plenty Brook. It {{originally}} occupied {{the site of the}} present Herne Bay <b>sorting</b> <b>office</b> and business park. It was recorded as a 40−acre farm in 1661, stretching as far as Parsonage Farm, along what is now Canterbury Road and Mill Lane. Past owners and tenants included Richard Constant, Jarvis Dadd, John and Mary Sole and Richard Reynolds. By 1841 it was an arable and pasture farm owned by Edward Collard.|$|E
25|$|For {{some time}} a {{department}} called the GPO Special Investigations Unit {{was responsible for}} intercepting letters ("postal interception") as part of British intelligence service operations. The Unit had branches in every major <b>sorting</b> <b>office</b> in the UK and in St Martin's Le Grand GPO, near St Paul's Cathedral. Letters targeted for interception by the Special Investigations Unit were steamed open and the contents photographed, and the photographs were then sent in unmarked green vans to MI5.|$|E
50|$|Belt {{conveyors}} can now {{be manufactured}} with curved sections which use tapered rollers and curved belting to convey products around a corner. These conveyor systems are commonly used in postal <b>sorting</b> <b>offices</b> and airport baggage handling systems. A sandwich belt conveyor uses two conveyor belts, face-to-face, to firmly contain the item being carried, making steep incline and even vertical-lift runs achievable.|$|R

25|$|In 1990-91 {{the former}} Royal Mail <b>sorting</b> <b>office</b> was {{demolished}} {{and replaced with}} a six storey modern office block bounded by Pinfold Hill, Hill Street and the tracks of New Street railway station. The office block was financed by John Laing Developments and SC Properties Limited, built by John Laing Construction and designed by Seymour Harris Partnership. The listed {{part of the building}} was retained, forming the entrance lobby to the offices beyond. The new building was completed on 23 December 1991 at a cost of £25 million.|$|E
25|$|South Shields {{town centre}} and {{riverside}} are undergoing significant regeneration, with new housing, business and leisure uses replacing old industrial sites. The town centre offers high street shopping, a regular market by the Grade I listed old town hall, central library, {{head post office}} and <b>sorting</b> <b>office,</b> museum & art gallery, bus/Metro interchange, town hall and civic offices. The Customs House is located within the historic Mill Dam conservation area and hosts a theatre, cinema, art gallery and restaurant. Arbeia formed the easternmost extremity of the Roman Empire at Hadrian's Wall and {{is located at the}} mouth of the River Tyne on the North Sea coast. Excavations, a reconstructed fort and museum are open to the public on the historic Lawe Top site (Old English: hill top).|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1919 the Corporation was {{applying}} for parliamentary powers to run motor buses 5 to 10 miles beyond the city boundaries. Fares for ordinary services were charged on a graduated scale based on distance - the higher the fare (charged by the penny, 1d, 2d, etc.), the further the distance. As of early 1922, 1d bought 1,033 yards, while 5d bought 4 miles 1,170 yards. Special services in the early 1920s included football specials (requiring as many as 30 extra buses) and late night services to venues like the Marine Gardens ballroom, with the entrance fee included in the ticket. In the early years buses and trams also carried parcels, working with a network of collection/delivery boys, with the head office acting as a <b>sorting</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After World War II, {{with the}} arrival of {{electronics}} for reading chords and looking in tables of [...] "codes", the postal <b>sorting</b> <b>offices</b> started to research chordic solutions to be able to employ people other than trained and expensive typists. In 1954, an important concept was discovered: chordic production is easier to master when the production is done at the release of the keys instead of when they are pressed.|$|R
5000|$|Night {{boxes were}} a service of post office boxes {{offered by the}} British Post Office at some major <b>sorting</b> <b>offices</b> during the inter-war years. Such boxes were {{available}} to callers to collect mail during the night hours when the boxes were normally closed to callers, at double the rent of normal boxes. Letters to such boxes had to be sent in red envelopes clearly marked [...] "Special Private Box Night Delivery".|$|R
50|$|A Royal Mail {{rubber band}} {{is a small}} red elastic loop used by the postal {{delivery}} service in the United Kingdom. In the course of its work, the Royal Mail consumes nearly one billion rubber bands per year to tie together bundles of letters at <b>sorting</b> <b>offices.</b> In the 2000s, complaints about Royal Mail rubber bands littering the streets of Britain gave rise to ongoing press interest in this minor cultural phenomenon.|$|R
25|$|Upton {{has its own}} Police station, {{which is}} a branch of Merseyside Police, and a Fire station which is a branch of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, {{as well as an}} {{ambulance}} station, operated by the North West Ambulance Service, at the nearby Arrowe Park Hospital. The village has a Jobcentre Plus, as well as a postal <b>sorting</b> <b>office.</b> There is also a driving test centre on Arrowe Park Road and two MOT test centres, one of which is on Manor Drive and the other being on Arrowe Park Road, next to the fire station. There are two petrol stations in the village, these being operated by Shell, which is a 24-hour business, as well as Sainsbury's. Both of these are situated next to Upton Bypass at Arrowe Park Road. Meanwhile, the Arrowebrook telephone exchange is situated on Church Road and serves approximately 25,000 residential premises and 686 non-residential premises. The exchange is operated by BT. This provides ADSL and SDSL services, among others.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} was given Grade II protection as a listed building on 25 September 1972. However, in 1973 a plan by the Midlands Postal Board to demolish {{the building and}} replace it with a high rise scheme by R. Seifert and Partners was granted permission. After a seven-year campaign by the Victorian Society, joined in 1976 by the Green Ban Action Committee, led by Pete Carter, the {{building was}} saved from demolition. The Victorian Society broke new ground in conservation tactics by submitting for planning permission an alternative scheme which retained the post office. The postal board adopted this scheme as a basis for the future development of the site. The future development involved the demolition of the red brick <b>sorting</b> <b>office</b> at the rear of building. The adjacent parcels office which was connected by a link bridge over Hill Street was also demolished, and was replaced in 1985 by One Victoria Square, designed by Watkins Grey Woodgate International. The preservation of the Post Office was one of the first and most important victories for architectural conservation by the Victorian Society.|$|E
25|$|Eddington is {{approximately}} 13 metres above sea level, lying above mainly London Clay with some head Brickearth next to Plenty Brook; however {{to the east}} this changes to Tertiary deposits of the Thanet, Oldhaven and Woolwich beds. Its northern boundary is the railway line, and its southern edge includes the Thanet Way and Herne Bay cemetery. At its western limit is Eddington Business Park and its eastern sector contains part of Eddington Conservation Area. This conservation area includes {{a small portion of}} the north-west of Herne and Broomfield parish, known locally as the Links. Herne Bay Golf Club is in the south of Eddington. Herne Bay Golf Club closed sometime during between 2011 and 2016 and has since been transformed into yet another housing estate. Eddington Business Park contains Herne Bay Delivery Office for the Royal Mail. Herne bay delivery and <b>sorting</b> <b>office</b> closed in 2016 and is now a children's soft play area. In the past, parts of Eddington have been susceptible to flooding from Plenty Brook and the Council has recommended the construction of upstream storage lagoons near Herne Bay Golf Course besides other measures.|$|E
50|$|In 1911, a plan {{evolved to}} build an {{underground}} railway 6+1/2 mi long from Paddington to Whitechapel serving the main <b>sorting</b> <b>offices</b> along the route; road traffic congestion was causing unacceptable delays. The contract to build the tunnels was won by John Mowlem and Co. Construction of the tunnels started in February 1915 {{from a series of}} shafts. Most of the line was constructed using the Greathead shield system, with limited amounts of hand-mining for connecting tunnels at stations.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{countries}} have many sorting offices; the USPS has about 275. [...] Some small territories such as Tahiti have only one. Sorting vans were used at various times; the UK had sorting vans, or carriages, in their Travelling Post Offices but those services were terminated in 2004. {{while in the}} USA the Railway Mail Service used a Railway post <b>office</b> for <b>sorting</b> the mail. As of 2017, Germany has about 95-98 <b>sorting</b> <b>offices</b> across the country.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional manual mail sorting {{broke the}} routing task into a {{hierarchy}} of sorting stations. Letters were delivered to sorters who examined the address {{and placed it in}} {{one of a number of}} [...] "pigeon holes". At smaller <b>sorting</b> <b>offices,</b> the pigeon holes could represent individual delivery routes. Runners would collect all the mail from a particular route's pigeon hole from all of the sorting stations in the office and then hand it off to the deliverymen.|$|R
500|$|During the {{construction}} of Heathrow Airport, Northolt was used for commercial civil flights, becoming the busiest airport in Europe for a time and a major base for British European Airways. More recently the station has become the hub of British military flying operations in the London area. Northolt has been extensively redeveloped since 2006 to accommodate these changes, becoming home to the British Forces Post Office, which moved to a newly constructed headquarters and <b>sorting</b> <b>office</b> on the site. Units currently [...] based at RAF Northolt are No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron, the Queen's Colour Squadron, 600 (City of London) Squadron, No 1 Aeronautical Information Documents Unit, the Air Historical Branch and the Central Band of the RAF.|$|E
500|$|A short {{distance}} {{south of the}} three burial grounds, on St. Martin's Le Grand, {{was the site of}} a collegiate church and sanctuary founded in 750 by Withu, King of Kent, expanded in 1056 by Ingebrian, Earl of Essex and issued with a Royal Charter in 1068 by William the Conqueror. The site of the church was cleared in 1818 in preparation {{for the construction of a}} new headquarters and central <b>sorting</b> <b>office</b> for the General Post Office (GPO), which opened in 1829. In 1873 and 1895 the GPO building was greatly expanded in size, with the 1895 extension bordering the southern edge of the park itself. The park became extremely popular with workers in the GPO building, and soon became known as [...] "Postman's Park".|$|E
500|$|The road is {{mentioned}} {{in the title of}} the music hall song [...] "Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road". It was written in 1891 by Albert Chevalier, who was the lyricist and original performer; the music was written by his brother Charles Ingle. The song was popularised by Shirley Temple's performance in the 1939 film A Little Princess The street {{is mentioned}} multiple times in the Madness song [...] "Calling Cards", a song about running an illegitimate business [...] "in a <b>sorting</b> <b>office</b> in the Old Kent Road". It is featured in the chorus of the Levellers' song [...] "Cardboard Box City", which criticises the slow action on helping the homeless in London, specifically Old Kent Road being infrequently visited by the wealthy due to its being south of the Thames.|$|E
5|$|The postal county {{had many}} border {{inconsistencies}} where its constituent post towns encroached on neighbouring counties, {{such as the}} villages of Denham in Buckinghamshire, Wraysbury in Berkshire and Eastbury in Hertfordshire which were respectively in the post towns of Uxbridge, Staines and Northwood and therefore in the postal county of Middlesex. Egham Hythe, Surrey also had postal addresses of Staines, Middlesex. Conversely, Hampton Wick was conveniently placed in Kingston, Surrey with its <b>sorting</b> <b>offices</b> just across the river. Nearby Hampton Court Palace has a postal address of East Molesey, therefore associating it with Surrey.|$|R

50|$|By now a {{post office}} had been built at the station, {{relocated}} in 1855 from Henri-Chapelle on instructions from the regional head post office at Aachen. At Herbesthal this quickly became one of Europe's busiest mail depots. In 1890 the postal facilities were relocated to a new purposes built post office building beside the station, which would {{be taken over by}} the Belgian postal administration in 1920. During the 1920s up to 1,000 mail bags were processed here daily, and it was only after the introduction of so-called mobile <b>sorting</b> <b>offices,</b> using dedicated rail-cars, that the postal facilities at Herbesthal station were removed.|$|R
