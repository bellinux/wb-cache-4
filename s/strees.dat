5000|$|The Brownsville Bridge, {{also known}} as the Intercounty Bridge and the West Brownsville Bridge (most often heard in the high {{counties}} east of the river), is a truss bridge that carries vehicular traffic across the Monongahela River between Brownsville, Pennsylvania and West Brownsville, Pennsylvania. Since the opening of the Lane Bane Bridge and highway project to carry much of the intercounty through traffic away from the main <b>strees</b> of downtown Brownsville in the early 1960s, another commonly heard name is Old Brownsville Bridge for the four high level viaduct. [...] The West Brownsville-Brownsville Bridge was completed in 1914 to replace an 1831 wooden structure that was ill-suited for the vehicular traffic that the National Road was beginning to carry, as motorized vehicle traffic began replacing animal powered transportation technologies. The famous federal route has crossed the river at this point since its inception, with ferry service in the early nineteenth century. In 1960, the Lane Bane Bridge was constructed just downstream and U.S. Route 40 was moved to the new high-level structure. Currently, the route serves local traffic and is meant to tie together the interconnected towns on each bank.|$|E

40|$|Small {{earthquakes}} (Ms > 2. 0) {{have been}} recorded from 1970 {{to the present day}} and reveal a significant difference in seismicity between the stable Ordos block and its active surrounding area. The southern Ordos block is a conspicuous small earthquake belt clustered and isolated along the NNW direction and extends to the inner stable Ordos block; no active fault can match this small earthquake cluster. In this paper, we analyze the dynamic mechanism of this small earthquake cluster based on the GPS velocity field (from 1999 to 2007), which are mainly from Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC) with respect to the north and south China blocks. The principal direction of strain rate field, the expansion ratefield, the maximum shear strain rate, and the rotation rate were constrained using the GPS velocity field. The results show that the velocity field, which is bounded by the small earthquake cluster from Tongchuan to Weinan, differs from the strain rate field, and the crustal deformation is left-lateral shear. This left-lateral shear belt not only spatially coincides with the Neo-tectonic belt in the Weihe Basin but also with the NNW small earthquake cluster (the Ziwuling small earthquake cluster). Based on these studies, we speculate that the NNW small earthquake cluster is caused by left-lateral shear slip, which is prone to strain accumulation. When the strain releases along the weak zone of structure, small earthquakes diffuse within its upper crust. The maximum principal compression <b>strees</b> direction changed from NE-SW to NEE-SWW, and the former reverse faults in the southwestern margin of the Ordos block became a left-lateral strike slip due to readjustment of the tectonic <b>strees</b> field after the middle Pleistocene. The NNW Neo-tectonic belt in the Weihe Basin, the different movement character of the inner Weihe Basin (which was demonstrated through GPS measurements) and the small earthquake cluster belt reflect the activated southern margin of the Ordos block, which was generated through readjustment of the tectonic <b>strees</b> field after the middle Pleistocene...|$|E

It was conducted from April until September 2007 at Kupang This {{research was}} arranged in Completely Randomized Design (CRD) based a factorial experiment (3 x 4) with three replications. The first factor was soil water content showing the level of drought <b>strees,</b> i. e. soil water content 100 % field capacity, soil water content 75 % field capacity, and soil water content 50 % field capacity. The second factor was the concentration of kinetin i. e. 0, 20, 40 and 60 ppm. Furthermore, the seeds obtained from pot experiment were planted to know quality seeds. Data were analysed using analysis of variance, significant level at 5 %, continued with DMRT 5 %. The result showed that the drought up to soil water content 75 % and 50 % field capacity during reproductive stages of variety mung bean Fore Belu decreased yield and seed quality of mung bean. Kinetin sprayed on the leaves was effective to increase yield of mung bean. Concentration 60 ppm of kinetin indicated most the effective concentration to increase the growth and yield of variety mung bean Fore Belu. However concentration 40 ppm have been can give good response to yield of mung bean. Seed quality variety mungbean Fore Belu was not influenced by kinetin giving.
