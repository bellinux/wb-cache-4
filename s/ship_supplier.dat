Finally the feasibility {{and validity of the}} model were verified through the calculating example. The result have solved the problem that objectivity of appraising the suppliers is below...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} explores the {{acceptance}} of additive manufacturing for marine spares in the maritime industry. The main research question is: (1) Is additive manufacturing (3 D printing) likely to be accepted as an innovative technology and (2) is likely to significantly affect the supply of marine spares within the maritime industry? The unified theory of acceptance of technology (UTAUT) provides variables to research behavioural intention to utilize 3 D printing for marine spares. Three stakeholder groups are identified (printer manufacturer, <b>ship</b> <b>supplier</b> and end user) to conduct interviews and retrieve empirical data. Results show that even though attitude towards 3 D printing is positive the technology {{is not likely to}} be accepted and supply of marine spares is not affected. This is mainly caused by identified maritime characteristics (level of awareness, technology utilization and level of fragmentation). The current state of development of the technology for industrial purposes (printing metal) does not contribute to an efficient and effective (correlated with total cost of ownership) utilization but can be driven by engaging in partnerships. This could also drive awareness and trust that additive manufacturing could be a feasible alternative or even substitute for classic mass production of marine spares...|$|E

40|$|The {{world economy}} is in a {{transition}} period never experienced before, One of the main realising factors, boosting economy growth, is the catch up of many emerging countries. The emerging countries impose new competitive dimensions to the global economy, forcing well established multinational corporations into new competitive situations, brining both opportunities and threats. The construction equipment industry has entered a condition of unprecedented growth. The total market demand has increased significantly and the demand development is prospected to continue for many more years. To {{keep up with the}} market demand and the sales opportunities, {{it is important to have}} machines available in the market. This impose that the logistic strategy is getting more important for companies in order to keep up with the prospected sales opportunities. This Masters thesis is initiated by our case company, Volvo Construction Equipment International, currently suffering from an inefficient logistics strategy constraining international growth. Based on our analysis and conclusion, Volvo Construction Equipment is recommended to move from transaction selling, spot market like international logistics strategy towards a relationship marketing based logistics strategy establishing in-depth collaborations with key account <b>shipping</b> <b>suppliers.</b> Furthermore, we recommend that Volvo CE should consider a logistics management function in order to facilitate the inter-organizational flow of logistics information...|$|R

The outflow is spread out over a large surface area and the inflow enters as a sheet of water in front of the outflow, so the jellyfish do not get sucked into it. As of 2009, jellyfish were becoming popular in home aquariums. These home aquariums generate this special water flow pattern using an air-lift pump and require special food for the jellyfish, which can be <b>shipped</b> from <b>suppliers</b> to their final destination.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT 74 -Given a set {{of users}} with known demands, {{a set of}} {{suppliers}} with known supplies, and known costs of <b>shipping</b> between <b>suppliers</b> and users, the Bottle-neck Single Source Transportation is that of assigning the users to the suppliers so that the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the demand of each user is satisfied by a single supplier; (ii) the amount supplied by each supplier does not exceed its capacity; (iii) the maximum cost of supplying any user by its unique supplier is minimal. Applications of this problem include: voter redistricting, shipping per-ishable goods, assignment of city blocks to emergency facilities, and others. We first discuss a heuristic method which tries to find a feasible solu-tion by assigning the users in order of decreasing demand to the suppliers according to certain orders. In our experience on randomly generated problems, the heuristic {{was able to find}} a good, and frequently an optimal feasible solu-tion, most of the time...|$|R

40|$|Cross-docking {{is widely}} adopted as an {{alternative}} to traditional warehousing in many industries. It consolidates different deliveries from suppliers into specified shipments catered for respective customers, thus reducing transportation and inventory holding costs. This book chapter addresses the scheduling problem of delivery where the products are expected to <b>ship</b> from <b>suppliers</b> to cross-docking faculties to customers within time window. For generating online delivery scheduling for the distribution network, the problem, which is formulated with the objective of minimising the inventory, transportation and penalty cost, is solved by genetic algorithm. Experiments were conducted to study the robustness of the model and the performance of the important parameters. From the results, it was also found that as the number of deliveries, pickups, cross-docks, time horizon and product type increase, the number of variables involved increases which in turn increase the complexity of the model. With higher number of variables, the computational time elapsed increase tremendously and total cost increases with the number of product types.
