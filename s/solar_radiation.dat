5|$|A {{polar ice}} cap, or polar ice sheet, is a high-latitude region {{of a planet}} or moon that is covered in ice. Ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy as <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> from the sun than {{equatorial}} regions, resulting in lower surface temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of <b>solar</b> <b>radiation.</b> However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E

40|$|The {{possible}} {{ramifications of}} climate change include the influence it has upon the amount of cloud cover in the atmosphere. Clouds cause significant variation in the <b>solar</b> UV <b>radiation</b> reaching the earth’s surface and in turn the amount incident on ecosystems. The consequences of changes in <b>solar</b> UV <b>radiation</b> delivered to ecosystems due to climate change may be significant and should be investigated. Plants {{are an integral part}} of the world wide ecological balance, and research has shown they are affected by variations in <b>solar</b> UV <b>radiation.</b> Therefore research into the influence of <b>solar</b> UV <b>radiation</b> on plants is of particular significance. However, this requires a means of obtaining detailed information on the <b>solar</b> UV <b>radiation</b> received by plants. This research describes a newly developed dosimetric technique employed to gather information on <b>solar</b> UV <b>radiation</b> incident to the leaves of plants in combination with the measurement of spectral irradiances in order to provide an accurate method of collecting detailed information on the <b>solar</b> UV <b>radiation</b> affecting the canopy and lower leaf layers of individual plants. Variations in the measurements take into account the inclination and orientation of each leaf investigated, as well as the influence of shading by other leaves in the plant canopy...|$|R
5|$|Jupiter's low axial tilt {{means that}} the poles {{constantly}} receive less <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> than at the planet's equatorial region. Convection within {{the interior of the}} planet transports more energy to the poles, balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>solar</b> ultraviolet-B (UV-B) <b>radiation</b> on the growth, {{photosynthesis}} and the xanthophyll cycle of four acacia and two eucalyptus species in Darwin, Australia, were examined. <b>Solar</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> seemed to delay plant growth in all species examined {{even though it}} did not affect photosynthetic activity significantly. Under <b>solar</b> UV-B <b>radiation,</b> a reduced specific leaf area (SLA), and an increased leaf thickness and size of epidermis were observed in plants. Chlorophyll content decreased but leaf soluble protein content increased in plants under <b>solar</b> UV-B <b>radiation.</b> <b>Solar</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> apparently had a strong effect on chlorophyll degradation rather than {{the size of the}} xanthophyll cycle pool. It seemed that xanthophyll formation was more strongly affected by photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) than by <b>solar</b> UV-B <b>radiation.</b> The contents of sugar, sugar alcohol and total sugar did vary dramatically between treatments in all the species examined. Overall, the effect of solar UV-B on plant growth and form was much less detrimental than reported for indoor experiments where high UV-B dosage (relative to growth irradiance) was used. <b>Solar</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> did not cause any photodamage in acacia and eucalyptus plants examined. It had a significant effect on growth and metabolism such as plant height, canopy, leaf thickness and the contents of chlorophyll and soluble protein. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

5|$|Along {{with the}} {{asteroid}} bodies, {{the asteroid belt}} also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids.

5|$|At {{the edge}} of the continent, strong {{katabatic}} winds off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, wind speeds are typically moderate.

SETTING [...] 59 counties in England and Wales. SUBJECTS [...] All registered cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma during the period 1968 - 85. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Age and sex adjusted odds ratio for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in each county. RESULTS [...] Incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma {{was significantly associated with}} <b>solar</b> ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> levels (P < 0. 001), even after social class and employment in agriculture were controlled for (P = 0. 004). In a comparison of counties in the highest and lowest quarters of <b>solar</b> ultraviolet <b>radiation,</b> the relative risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was 1. 27 (95 % confidence interval 1. 24 to 1. 29), rising to 1. 34 (1. 32 to 1. 37) after adjustment for social class and employment in agriculture.

40|$|Many {{investigators}} {{have concluded that}} the level of <b>solar</b> ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> (200 - 300 nm) reaching the surface was a key parameter in the origin and evolution of life on earth. The level of <b>solar</b> ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> between 200 and 300 nm is controlled primarily by molecular absorption by ozone, whose presence is strongly coupled to the level of molecular oxygen. In this paper, a series of calculations is presented of the <b>solar</b> ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> reaching the surface for oxygen levels ranging from 0. 0001 the present atmospheric level to the present level. The solar spectrum between 200 and 300 nm has been divided into 34 spectral intervals. For each spectral interval, the <b>solar</b> ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> reaching the earth's surface has been calculated by considering the attenuation of the incoming beam due to ozone and oxygen absorption.

40|$|The {{ozone layer}} {{depletion}} and its harmful impact on living beings have been a greater concern of all the scientists all over the world. The aim {{of this paper is}} to reveal the current status of stratospheric ozone over Pakistan. The annual, monthly and seasonal analyses have been performed in order to check the status. The variation in total column of ozone has been observed during these analyses and decrease in total column of ozone has been seen in all the investigations from 1987 - 2008. The correlation coefficient for JRA forecasted data and observed ozone data is 0. 6. Both the data sets show decline in ozone concentration. The total change calculated in annual depth of ozone is ? 5. 67 D. U and ? 4. 2 D. U in monthly depth of ozone. The seasonal analysis shows that the total change in ozone in summer is ? 6. 3 D. U, in spring ? 10. 5 D. U, in winter ? 3. 15 D. U and in autumn ? 2. 0 D. U. Maximum change in ozone thickness has been found in spring and minimum in autumn. The <b>solar</b> <b>radiations,</b> decrease in temperatures of stratosphere and carbon dioxide (CO 2) play significant role in {{ozone layer depletion}}. According to the findings of this study <b>solar</b> <b>radiations</b> and carbon dioxide (CO 2) are inversely proportional to the total column of ozone. The correlation coefficient for <b>solar</b> <b>radiations</b> and ozone on annual basis is 0. 44 (R 2 = 0. 44) and on monthly basis is around 0. 35 (R 2 = 0. 35). Therefore the more intense the <b>solar</b> <b>radiations</b> the more ozone layer thinning will occur. The correlation coefficient for ozone and carbon dioxide is around 0. 3 (R 2 = 0. 3) during the study period. The decrease in stratospheric temperatures will cause the cooling of stratosphere which is ultimately responsible for ozone layer depletion. The total decrease analyzed in stratospheric temperatures during the study period is about ? 1. 3 ℃.
