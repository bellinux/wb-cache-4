40|$|Bacterial <b>sex</b> <b>factors</b> {{determine}} {{the synthesis of}} sex pili that act as receptors for donor-specific phages, so that many <b>sex</b> <b>factors</b> can be conveniently identified by the phage-sensitivity of their hosts (see Meynell, Meynell & Datta, 1968). Gross dif-ferences distinguish the two major groups of F-like and I-like pili and their factors, while minor differences are evident within the F-like group, as with the drug-resistance factor, R 100 - 1, and the plasmid, Fo-lac (Nishimura, Ishibashi, Meynell & Hirota, 1967; Lawn, Meynell, Meynell & Datta, 1967; Meynell et al. 1968).

40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that genetic conflicts drive turnovers between sex-determining mechanisms, yet these studies only apply to cases where sex allocation {{is independent of}} environment or condition. Here, we model parent-offspring conflict {{in the presence of}} condition-dependent sex allocation, where the environment has sex-specific fitness consequences. Additionally, one sex is assumed to be more costly to produce than the other, which leads offspring to favor a sex ratio less biased toward the cheaper sex in comparison to the sex ratio favored by mothers. The scope for parent-offspring conflict depends on the relative frequency of both environments: when one environment is less common than the other, parent-offspring conflict can be reduced or even entirely absent, despite a biased population sex ratio. The model shows that conflict-driven invasions of condition-independent <b>sex</b> <b>factors</b> (e. g., <b>sex</b> chromosomes) result either in the loss of condition-dependent sex allocation, or, interestingly, lead to stable mixtures of condition-dependent and condition-independent <b>sex</b> <b>factors.</b> The latter outcome corresponds to empirical observations in which sex chromosomes are present in organisms with environment-dependent sex determination. Finally, conflict can also favor errors in environmental perception, potentially resulting in the loss of condition-dependent sex allocation without genetic changes to sex-determining loci...|$|R

40|$|This project {{consisted}} of two studies, conceptually linked. In Study 1 a working definition of make-up sex was constructed and 60 make-up sex motivations were collected.

In Study 2 make-up sex motivations and the role of individual differences in the endorsement of make-up sex motivations were examined. Participants (N = 144) completed a questionnaire to measure make-up sex motivations, trait aggression, and sociosexuality. Factor analysis provided five distinct <b>factors</b> of make-up <b>sex</b> motivations, Resolve, Control, Arousal, Insecurity and Ascertain. Independent samples t-tests showed men to score significantly higher than women in Resolve, Control and Arousal, but not Insecurity or Ascertain. Additionally men scored significantly higher in physical aggression, short-term mating orientation, and previous sexual behavior than women. Correlational analysis revealed weak to moderate positive correlations between all four types of aggression and most of the make-up sex motivations.

40|$|Sex-associated and {{floating}} translocation complexes {{are characteristic of}} dioecious species of  Viscum,  but are virtually absent in monoecious species. The majority of dioecious species has fixed sex-associated translocation complexes with the male being the heterozygous sex. The sex-associated multivalent is usually O 4 (ring-of-four) or O 6, rarely O 8. Dioecious species without sex-associated translocations are much less common. Most of the dioecious species are also polymorphic for floating translocations, producing one or more additional multivalents ranging from O 4 to O 12. Floating translocations may be more frequent in species {{that do not have}} sex-associated translocations. Supernumerary chromosomes are also present in several species. Sex ratios are at unity in most dioecious species, but female-biased ratios may occur in some species. The high correlation between dioecy and translocation heterozygosity suggests that translocations are primarily associated with the origin and establishment of dioecy. Any róle in the maintenance of biased sex ratios through meiotic drive is probably secondary. Sex-associated translocations may serve to stabilize dioecy by bringing the <b>sex</b> <b>factors</b> into close linkage. Subsequent structural rearrangements within a sex-associated translocation complex may bring the <b>sex</b> <b>factors</b> together in one chromosome pair, releasing floating translocations. The high frequencies of floating translocation heterozygosity in some species indicate that such heterozygosity also has adaptive value. </p...|$|R

His electron microscope studies (with A.

The Social Implicit Cognition Method could overcome the insufficiency of explicit research methods such as Self-Report Scale, and carry on the thorough discussion to the intrinsic mechanism of the Adolenscent’s {{aggressive behavior}}. In this research, Implicit Association Test and Explicit Questionnaire are synthetically applied to inspect the relations among the aggression, Evaluation of Emotion Regulation and the aggressive behavior of the normal middle-school students and the Adolenscent violent criminals under the explicit and implicit conditions, and have carried the supplement to the internal condition of the General aggression model (GAM). The result indicates, 1. 	The concept of implicit aggression exists independently and separates from explicit aggression. However the relations between implicit aggression and the groups are remarkable, i. e. both the implicit and explicit aggressions of the Adolenscent violent criminals are remarkably {{higher than those of}} the normal middle-school students, but not influenced by <b>sex</b> <b>factors.</b> 2. 	Implicit Evaluation of Emotion Regulation is suitable to Chinese Adolenscents. The correlation of groups and <b>sex</b> <b>factors</b> exist to Implicit Evaluation of Emotion Regulation, i. e. in the group of criminals, the female inclines to the mood control compared with the male in the aspect of Implicit Evaluation of Emotion Regulation; however, in the group of normal persons, the difference between male and female is not remarkable in the aspect of Implicit Evaluation of Emotion Regulation. 3. 	Under the explicit conditions, it is discovered that the remarkable explicit aggression can predict violent criminals. But it is adjusted by Explicit Evaluation of Emotion Regulation, i. e. the predicting function is not remarkable when the Explicit Evaluation inclines to expression. Meanwhile, when checking the functions and the effects of the implicit variables after the explicit conditions are under control, it is discovered that the predicting function of implicit aggression is still remarkable, and the predicting function of Implicit Evaluation of Emotion Regulation is remarkable at the edge and also adjusted by <b>sex</b> <b>factors.</b> These findings help us not only understanding thoroughly the intrinsic mechanism of the Adolenscent’s aggressive behavior, discovering the moderating role of Evaluation of Emotion Regulation on aggression, but also providing an academic foundation on the prevention and intervention of the Adolenscent’s aggressive behavior. 青少年攻击行为以及由此引发的暴力犯罪引起了社会的普遍关注。社会内隐隐认知方法能够克服自陈量表等外显研究方法的不足，对青少年的攻击行为的内在机制进行深入探讨。本研究运用内隐联想测验和外显问卷相结合的方法，考察了在外显、内隐条件下正常中学生和未成年暴力犯的攻击性、情绪调节评价和攻击行为之间的关系。 结果表明： 1. 	内隐攻击性的概念是独立存在的，并与外显攻击性是相分离；而内隐攻击性与组别之间的关系显著，即未成年暴力犯的外显攻击性和内隐攻击性都显著高于普通中学生，但不受性别因素的影响。 2. 	情绪调节内隐评价在中国青少年中是适用的；在情绪调节内隐评价上存在组别、性别因素的交互作用，即在犯罪组，女性比男性的情绪调节内隐评价更偏向于情绪控制；而在正常组，男性和女性的情绪调节内隐评价差异不显著。 3. 	内隐攻击性和外显攻击性都能显著地预测暴力犯罪。在外显条件下，发现外显攻击性显著预测是否暴力犯，但受到情绪调节外显评价的调节，即在外显评价更倾向于表达者中，预测作用不显著。同时控制外显条件后，检验内隐变量的作用效果，发现内隐攻击性的预测作用依然显著，情绪调节内隐评价预测作用边缘显著，并受到性别的调节。 上述发现不仅深化了我们对攻击行为内在机制的认识，同时也发现了情绪调节评价对攻击的调节作用，为我们今后对青少年攻击行为的预防和干预工作提供了理论依据...|$|R
