5|$|In 1831 and 1848, serious {{outbreaks}} of cholera had overwhelmed the crowded cemeteries of London, causing bodies to be stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves to be exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials. Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory, and the bad <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{analyses}} of the composition of durian aroma found numerous volatile compounds including esters, ketones, and different sulphur compounds, with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour. People in South East Asia with frequent exposures to durian are able to easily distinguish its sweet-like ketones and esters scent from rotten or putrescine odours which are from volatile amines and fatty acids. Developmental or genetic differences in olfactory perception and mapping within the brain (for e.g. anterior piriform cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex) could possibly explain why some individuals are unable to differentiate these <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> find this fruit noxious whereas others find it extremely pleasant and appealing.|$|E
5|$|London's dead had {{traditionally}} been buried {{in and around}} local churches, and with {{a limited amount of}} space for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials. In {{the first half of the}} 19thcentury the population of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300acres (0.5sqmi; 1.2km2), spread across around 200 small sites. Graveyards became very congested. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid. Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory (the belief that airborne particles were the primary factor in the spread of contagious disease), and the bad <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one.|$|E

Stressors (including temperature extremes, foul <b>smells,</b> <b>and</b> being hunted by the enemy) increase Snake's stress gauge, eventually depleting his Psyche. Adverse effects include difficulty in aiming, more frequent back pain {{and the possibility of}} Snake passing out upon receiving damage. Among the available methods of restoring Psyche are eating, drinking, smoking, and reading an adult magazine.|$|E
25|$|Although Poe {{wrote this}} short story before the {{invention}} of modern psychological science, Roderick's condition can be described according to its terminology. It includes a form of sensory overload known as hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to textures, light, sounds, <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> tastes), hypochondria (an excessive preoccupation or worry about having a serious illness) and acute anxiety. It is revealed that Roderick's twin sister, Madeline, is also ill and falls into cataleptic, deathlike trances. Roderick and Madeline are the only remaining members of the Usher family.|$|E

25|$|Body Farm {{staff is}} also {{studying}} the compounds released by corpses after burial. If {{a person is}} reported missing, the authorities search for the missing entities using K-9 units, {{but they do not}} know what specifically activates what the K-9 smell for. Research has confirmed that dead bodies give off more than 400 compounds. Due to the success of this research, they can recreate these <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> train dogs on what exactly to search for, making these animals much more effective in aiding with homicide cases.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} June 1947, Levi {{suddenly}} left DUCO and {{teamed up}} with an old friend Alberto Salmoni to run a chemical consultancy from {{the top floor of}} Salmoni's parents' house. Many of Levi's experiences of this time found their way into his later writing. They made most of their money from making and supplying stannous chloride for mirror makers, delivering the unstable chemical by bicycle across the city. The attempts to make lipsticks from reptile excreta and a coloured enamel to coat teeth were turned into short stories. Accidents in their laboratory filled the Salmoni house with unpleasant <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> corrosive gases.|$|E
25|$|Tollers {{have the}} {{capacity}} to be very social dogs, {{as long as they are}} sufficiently socialized early on in life. While Tollers are energetic and outgoing around their owners and family, their cautious nature makes them reserved around strangers. Exposure to new people, locations, <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> sights are crucial to the healthy development of the Toller breed. They tend to get along well with other dogs; however, they have a strong prey drive and may chase after cats or other small animals. Their prey drive can be avoided if cats, for example, are introduced early on in a Toller's life. Failure to properly socialize Tollers at a young age may result in aggressive, destructive, or timid behaviour in maturity.|$|E

25|$|A VEI 3 {{eruption}} occurred from 17 January 1991 to 11 March 1991, producing 0.15km3 of lava and 2×107m3 of tephra. The eruption, {{which was}} preceded by sulphurous <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> earthquakes, started as a Plinian eruption, producing an ash cloud reaching an altitude of 11.5km within 10minutes which had travelled over 200km north-northeast to the coast within 3hours. The eruption then began producing andesitic lava, the flows eventually covering an area of 23km2 to an average depth of 6–7m. Initially, part of the Heklugja fissure and other fissures erupted with lava fountains reaching 300m in height. By the second day, the activity stopped {{in all but one}} fissure where the main crater formed. During these 2days, 800m3·s−1 of lava were produced, slowing to between 1m3s−1 and 14m3·s−1 for most of the eruption. This low viscosity lava had a SiO2 content of approximately 54%.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{esterification}} {{that takes}} place in wines and other alcoholic beverages during the aging process is an example of acid-catalysed esterification. Over time, the acidity of the acetic acid and tannins in an aging wine will catalytically protonate other organic acids (including acetic acid itself), encouraging ethanol to react as a nucleophile. As a result, ethyl acetate – the ester of ethanol and acetic acid—is the most abundant ester in wines. Other combinations of organic alcohols (such as phenol-containing compounds) and organic acids lead to a variety of different esters in wines, contributing to their different flavours, <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> tastes. Of course, when compared to sulfuric acid conditions, the acid conditions in a wine are mild, so yield is low (often in tenths or hundredths of a percentage point by volume) and take years for ester to accumulate.|$|E
25|$|Brake discs and pads require {{sometime}} {{to adhere}} to each other smoothly. The pads need to deposit an even transfer layer. For street and urban driving with new pads and rotors {{it is best to}} treat them as a break in period as you would a new car for 200 to 300 miles after this period the manufactures bedding procedure can be followed. This is typically some number of stops from a certain max speed to a minimum speed. For example 10 moderate stops from 60 mph to 10mph in a safe controlled environment where no hazards are present. The goal is to get the brake pads and brake discs hot. During this time it is ideal to keep the brake pressure and stops consistent without engaging the Anti lock braking system or skidding the tires. There will likely be <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> a light amount of smoke. This is normal. Once the brakes begin to suffer from fade(braking effectiveness slightly reduced) the process is complete. Continue to drive at moderate speeds to cool the brake discs and rotors avoiding the use of the brakes unless needed for emergency situations. Also take note when coming to a complete stop until everything has cooled not to hold your foot on the brakes which could create an imprint.|$|E

[...] The doctors of Manchester, led by Dr Thomas Percival [...] were commissioned to investigate the cause of the fever and to recommend how to prevent its spread.

500|$|Richards {{was born}} on August 19, 1925 in New York City to George H. Richards and Marianna Middlebrook Richards. Both parents were from old New England {{families}} who had settled in Fairfield and New London, Connecticut in the 1600s. [...] The family usually spent summers in Connecticut, giving Richards an early affinity for the area which continued through his career at Yale University. He had two older sisters, Marianna and Sarah. Marianna became a biochemist, and was a significant role model for Fred, who delighted in the <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> explosions produced by chemistry sets in that era. He attended high school at Phillips Exeter Academy, and later recalled that [...] "the excellent science department even permitted certain students the unsupervised run of the laboratories outside of class hours. This attitude played a strong role... in cementing our commitment to scientific careers." [...] He learned glassblowing and electronics there, and tried to measure the universal gravitational constant using 100-pound cannonballs.|$|E
500|$|Like the Indian rhino, the Javan {{rhinoceros}} has {{a single}} horn (the other extant species have two horns). Its horn is the smallest of all extant rhinos, usually less than [...] with the longest recorded only [...] Only males have horns. Female Javan rhinos are the only extant rhinos that remain hornless into adulthood, though they may develop a tiny bump of {{an inch or two}} in height. The Javan rhinoceros does not appear to often use its horn for fighting, but instead uses it to scrape mud away in wallows, to pull down plants for eating, and to open paths through thick vegetation. Similar to the other browsing species of rhino (Black, Sumatran, and Indian), the Javan rhino has a long, pointed, upper lip which helps in grabbing food. Its lower incisors are long and sharp; when the Javan rhino fights, it uses these teeth. Behind the incisors, two rows of six low-crowned molars are used for chewing coarse plants. Like all rhinos, the Javan rhino <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> hears well, but has very poor vision. They are estimated to live for 30 to 45 years.|$|E

500|$|Public {{health policy}} {{at this time}} was shaped by the miasma theory (the belief that {{airborne}} particles released by decaying flesh were the primary factor in the spread of contagious illness), and the bad <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded {{that it was impossible}} to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one. Commissioner and sanitation campaigner Edwin Chadwick testified that each year, 20,000 adults and 30,000 children were being buried in less than [...] of already full burial grounds; the Commission heard that one cemetery, Spa Fields in Clerkenwell, designed to hold 1,000 bodies, contained 80,000 graves, and that gravediggers throughout London were obliged to shred bodies in order to cram the remains into available grave space. In 1848–49 a cholera epidemic killed 14,601 people in London and overwhelmed the burial system completely. Bodies were left stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves were exhumed to make way for new burials.|$|E
500|$|During the 1938 tour of England, Hassett smuggled a “wet, muddy, and complaining” {{mountain}} goat (put a waistcoat on the goat, {{according to}} some sources) into the bedroom he shared with Stan McCabe and O'Reilly while the team was staying at Grindleford, after they had fallen asleep. They awoke to unexpected <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> bleating. During the 1948 tour of England, he {{was reported to have}} unnerved his teammates and tempted fate by bringing a toy duck into the dressing room, and held up play during a county match by hiding the ball in a pile of sawdust. During the same summer, Hassett and a few teammates were being chauffeured back to London after a function. It was after midnight, but Hassett asked the driver to stop at a random mansion along the road. He then rang the bell and told the startled householder that he [...] "just thought we'd pop in". The owner happened to recognise Hassett and received the cricketers. In the Third Test of the same tour, after dropping two hooked catches from Washbrook, Hassett responded by borrowing a policeman’s helmet, before motioning to Ray Lindwall to bowl another bouncer. During the 1953 tour of England, a waiter spilled a dessert on Hassett's jacket. Initially declining the waiter's multiple offers to have his jacket taken away for cleaning, Hassett acquiesced and while taking off his jacket, noticed a spot on his trousers. He then silently pointed to the spot, removed his trousers and handed them to the waiter, before continuing to eat his meal in his underpants.|$|E
500|$|Mature bulls, {{generally}} {{more than four}} years old, set up their own territories through which female herds often pass. These territories are maintained throughout the year, with animals usually separated by a distance of about , but this can vary according {{to the quality of the}} habitat. In favourable conditions, this distance is as little as , but can be as large as [...] in poor habitat. Each bull has a patch of ground in the centre of his territory in which he regularly drops dung, and in which he performs acts of display. These include urinating, scraping, pawing and rolling on the ground and thumping it with his horns - all of which demonstrate his prowess to other bulls. An encounter between two bulls involves elaborate rituals. Estes coined the term [...] "Challenge Ritual" [...] to describe this behaviour for the blue wildebeest, but this is also applicable to the black wildebeest, owing to the close similarity in the behaviour in both species. The bulls approach each other with their heads lowered, resembling a grazing position (sometimes actually grazing). This is usually followed by movements like standing in a reverse-parallel position, in which one male urinates and the opponent <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> performs flehmen, after which they may reverse the procedure. During this ritual or afterwards the two can toss their horns at each other, circle one another, or even look away. Then begins the fight, which may be of low intensity (consisting of interlocking the horns and pushing each other in a standing position) or high intensity (consisting of their dropping to their knees and straining against each other powerfully, trying to remain in contact while their foreheads are nearly touching the ground). Threat displays like shaking the head may also take place.|$|E
