5|$|Feminist {{theory is}} the {{extension}} of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work {{in a variety of}} disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, economics, women's studies, literary criticism, art history, psychoanalysis and philosophy. Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics, power relations, and sexuality. While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, <b>stereotyping,</b> objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, and patriarchy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stereotype</b> threat {{concerns}} how <b>stereotype</b> cues can harm performance. However, {{in certain}} situations, <b>stereotype</b> activation {{can also lead}} to performance enhancement through <b>stereotype</b> lift or <b>stereotype</b> boost. <b>Stereotype</b> lift increases performance when people are exposed to negative <b>stereotypes</b> about another group. This enhanced performance has been attributed to increases in self-efficacy and decreases in self-doubt as a result of negative outgroup <b>stereotypes.</b> <b>Stereotype</b> boost suggests that positive <b>stereotypes</b> may enhance performance. <b>Stereotype</b> boost occurs when a positive aspect of an individual's social identity is made salient in an identity-relevant domain. Although <b>stereotype</b> boost is similar to <b>stereotype</b> lift in enhancing performance, <b>stereotype</b> lift {{is the result of a}} negative outgroup <b>stereotype,</b> whereas <b>stereotype</b> boost occurs due to activation of a positive ingroup <b>stereotype.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{indirect}} <b>stereotype</b> change hypothesis {{states that}} if a population consists of a few groups (e. g. men and women), with group <b>stereotypes</b> describing how the groups differ (e. g. gender <b>stereotypes),</b> stereotype-relevant information about one group may affect the <b>stereotype</b> not only of that target group but also of an alternative group. Stereotype-inconsistent information is thought to reduce, and stereotype-hyperconsistent information is thought to strengthen the <b>stereotype</b> of both groups. We demonstrated this phenomenon in warmth- and competencerelated aspects of <b>stereotypes</b> (Study 1) and gender <b>stereotypes</b> (Study 2), newly formed <b>stereotypes</b> (Study 1) and real-life <b>stereotypes</b> (Study 2), and taking the form of <b>stereotype</b> reduction {{under the influence of}} stereotype-inconsistent information (Study 1 and 2) or of <b>stereotype</b> enhancement under the influence of stereotype-hypercongruent information (Study 2).

40|$|Much {{research}} has examined how <b>stereotype</b> threat {{leads to the}} underperformance of <b>stereotyped</b> targets. The underlying cause for this effect, however, remains unclear. Some,researchers argue that <b>stereotype</b> threat can be explained from a behavioral-priming perspective, while others claim that it necessarily involves concerns about confirming a negative self-relevant <b>stereotype.</b> The current experiment highlights the critical role of self-relevance in distinguishing between <b>stereotype</b> priming and <b>stereotype</b> threat. Results showed that when participants wrote about a <b>stereotyped</b> target from a first-person perspective, both targets and non-targets performed poorly under <b>stereotype</b> threat conditions, because writing from a first-person perspective made the <b>stereotype</b> self-relevant for non-targets. But when participants wrote about a <b>stereotyped</b> target from a third-person perspective, only targets underperformed since the <b>stereotype</b> was already self-relevant. Moreover, when the <b>stereotype</b> was made self-relevant non-targets experienced the same threat-based concerns that targets experience under <b>stereotype</b> threat conditions.

An individual targeted by a positive <b>stereotype</b> associated with their social group may assume that the stereotyper also believes they possess the negative <b>stereotypes</b> associated with the group. [...] The negative <b>stereotype</b> that is assumed to be held by the stereotyper depends on to what social group the positive <b>stereotype</b> references. In a study by Siy & Cheryan (2016), Asian-American men were either exposed to a positive <b>stereotype</b> about their race (e.g., “Asians are ambitious) or their gender (e.g., “Men are ambitious”). Asian men that were positively <b>stereotyped</b> based on their gender were more likely to believe that negative gender <b>stereotypes</b> (e.g., aggressive, dominant) were also being applied to them than those who were only targets of positive racial <b>stereotypes.</b> In a similar manner, Asian men that were targets of positive racial <b>stereotypes</b> were more likely to believe that negative racial <b>stereotypes</b> (e.g., bad at driving, bad at English) were also being applied to them.|$|R

40|$|Although <b>stereotype</b> {{awareness}} {{is a prerequisite}} for <b>stereotype</b> threat effects (Steele & Aronson, 1995), research showed girls' deficit under <b>stereotype</b> threat before the emergence of math–gender <b>stereotype</b> awareness, {{and in the absence of}} <b>stereotype</b> endorsement. In a study including 240 six-year-old children, this paradox was addressed by testing whether automatic associations trigger <b>stereotype</b> threat in young girls.

5|$|The Washington Redskins name {{controversy}} {{involves the}} name and logo of the Washington Redskins, a National Football League (NFL) franchise in the Washington metropolitan area. Native American individuals, tribes and organizations have been questioning the use of {{the name and}} image for decades. According to the American Psychological Association as of 2010, over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts have published resolutions or policies that state that the use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a harmful form of ethnic <b>stereotyping</b> that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice, contributing to other problems faced by Native Americans. The Washington, D.C., team is only one example of the larger controversy, but it receives more public attention because modern dictionaries define the name as derogatory or insulting and because the team represents the nation's capital.|$|E
5|$|To further complicate this controversy, {{many feel}} that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots.

The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the Cleveland Indians' Chief Wahoo; the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as Redskins or Squaws; or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures; such as the tomahawk chop.|$|E

40|$|When people {{encounter}} {{information that}} is incongruent with a <b>stereotype</b> the logical expectation is that the relevant <b>stereotype</b> should change. However, research on <b>stereotype</b> change suggests that <b>stereotypes</b> are remarkably resistant to change. A limitation {{of this research is}} that it often treats <b>stereotypes</b> as independently from other <b>stereotypes.</b> When all members of a population can be categorized into a limited number of groups, however, <b>stereotypes</b> may be interdependent. For instance, all humans are male or female. Attributing a characteristic to one gender therefore implies denying that characteristic to the other gender. One implication of the interdependence of <b>stereotypes</b> is that stereotype-incongruent information about one group (the target group) may evoke a change in the <b>stereotype</b> about another group (the alternative group). Using a paradigm in which participants learned <b>stereotypes</b> about two complementary groups and then encountered information that was incongruent with one of these <b>stereotypes</b> we tested this implication. The <b>stereotype</b> learning procedure successfully created the <b>stereotypes.</b> As compared to a control condition in which participants received additional stereotype-congruent information about a target group, additional stereotype-incongruent information changed their <b>stereotype</b> of that target group. Importantly, stereotype-incongruent information about a target group also affected the <b>stereotype</b> about the alternative group.

5|$|The {{issue is}} often {{discussed}} in the media {{only in terms of}} the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a fuller understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why use of such names and images by sports teams should be eliminated. Social science research says that sports mascots and images, rather than being mere entertainment, are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects. The accumulation of research on the harm done has led to over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts adopting resolutions or policies that state that the use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a form of ethnic <b>stereotyping</b> that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans.|$|E

40|$|Four {{experiments}} investigated if {{beneficiaries of}} affirmative action experience <b>stereotype</b> threat and its negative consequences. Study one consisted of an experiment in which we simulated affirmative native action procedures. We found that affirmative action programs which do not ensure beneficiaries of their equality of merit and ability, can induce <b>stereotype</b> threat and its negative consequences. However we recognised that the previous affirmative action manipulations may not match the forms of Affirmative action utilized in Northern Ireland. Therefore study two used a more applicable "weak" preferential selection manipulation. We found that this found {{of affirmative action}} did not induce <b>stereotype</b> threat nor its negative consequences as these participants knew the <b>stereotype</b> of affirmative action was not true of themselves. However the <b>stereotype</b> threat hypothesis postulates that <b>stereotype</b> endorsement {{is not necessary to}} induce <b>stereotype</b> threat. Study three empirically tested this assumption. We manipulated both the presentation of a <b>stereotype,</b> and participants' personal endorsement of that <b>stereotype.</b> We found that the inducement of <b>stereotype</b> threat does not in fact require <b>stereotype</b> endorsement. This finding leads us to ask why affirmative action in study two did not induce <b>stereotype</b> threat. We hypothesised that these participants simply were not aware {{they were part of a}} <b>stereotyped</b> group. Therefore in study four we presented beneficiaries of weak preferential selection manipulations with the widespread <b>stereotype</b> surrounding affirmative action. We found that when beneficiaries of weak affirmative action procedures encounter the negative <b>stereotype</b> associated with affirmative action, <b>stereotype</b> threat is induced. The present research contributes to the previous literature by moving the argument on from the forms of affirmative action used, to how public discourses and presentations of affirmative action may be the true cause for concern.

To disentangle these findings, we tested the hypothesis that implicit math-gender <b>stereotypes</b> could already be detected in young girls, long before explicit ones. We measured implicit and explicit gender <b>stereotypes,</b> math performance, and attitudes towards math and reading in 6 -year-olds. We also assessed parents’ implicit and explicit gender <b>stereotypes,</b> and expectations for their children.

We follow by identifying the likely triggers of <b>stereotype</b> threat within organizations, including task difficulty, organizational structure, minority representation, and organizational culture. Finally, we identify three categories of strategies that organizations can implement to reduce <b>stereotype</b> threat: 1) <b>stereotype</b> management, which includes acknowledging <b>stereotypes,</b> emphasizing positive <b>stereotypes,</b> and deemphasizing negative stereotypes; 2) hiring and training, which includes increasing minority representation and job training; and 3) organizational culture, including both fostering identity safety and valuing effort...|$|R

50|$|<b>Stereotype</b> {{threat is}} a {{potential}} contributing factor to long-standing racial and gender gaps in academic performance. It may occur whenever an individual's performance might confirm a negative <b>stereotype</b> because <b>stereotype</b> threat is thought to arise from a particular situation, rather than from an individual's personality traits or characteristics. Since most people {{have at least one}} social identity which is negatively <b>stereotyped,</b> most people are vulnerable to <b>stereotype</b> threat if they encounter {{a situation in which the}} <b>stereotype</b> is relevant. Situational factors that increase <b>stereotype</b> threat can include the difficulty of the task, the belief that the task measures their abilities, and the relevance of the <b>stereotype</b> to the task. Individuals show higher degrees of <b>stereotype</b> threat on tasks they wish to perform well on and when they identify strongly with the <b>stereotyped</b> group. These effects are also increased when they expect discrimination due to their identification with a negatively <b>stereotyped</b> group. Repeated experiences of <b>stereotype</b> threat can lead to a vicious circle of diminished confidence, poor performance, and loss of interest in the relevant area of achievement.|$|R
