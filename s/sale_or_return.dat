50|$|Nearly half {{a century}} ago, Edith Penrose (1959) pointed out that {{superior}} profitability (e.g. <b>return</b> on <b>sales</b> <b>or</b> <b>return</b> on assets) was neither interesting to investors - who value the prospect of increasing future cash flows - nor sustainable over time. Profitability is not entirely unimportant - it does after all provide the investment in new resources to enable growth to occur. More recently, Rugman and Verbeke (2002) have reviewed {{the implications of this}} observation for research in strategy. Richard Rumelt (2007) has again raised the importance of making progress with the issue of strategy dynamics, describing it as still ‘the next frontier … underresearched, underwritten about, and underunderstood’.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the possible effects of government {{financial support to}} firms through Innovation Norway (IN). We compare firms that received support from IN in the years 2006 - 2010 with comparable firms that applied for support, but were rejected. To manage potential endogeneity problems, we assess the effects of IN support by combining propensity score matching with a differences-in-differences estimation. We thereby control for observable firm characteristics and fixed firm effects. The treatment effects of participation are estimated for two types of IN grants: Establishing grants and development grants. The treatment effects are measured as differences in growth between the treated and matched firms the first two and three years after receiving IN support. We find no evidence that establishing grants have positive effects on value creation, number of employees <b>or</b> <b>return</b> on assets. We even find some evidence of negative effects of receiving establishing grants on operating profits and sales revenue. However, the results for sales revenue are not robust, and the results for operating profits are only significant two years after treatment. For development grants, we find significant positive effects on operating profits and employment. On the other hand, we find no clear evidence that development grants have positive effects on value creation, <b>sales</b> revenue <b>or</b> <b>return</b> on assets...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{examined}} the relationship between gender diversity on the board and firm performance for developed countries, but similar efforts for developing countries are rare. Employing a panel of over 1, 000 listed firms for a period from 1999 to 2007, this study assesses the impact of women directors on the performance of listed firms in China. Our main results suggest that: 1) The percent of women directors has a positive impact on firm performance as measured by <b>return</b> on <b>sales</b> (ROS) <b>or</b> <b>return</b> on assets (ROA), 2) The number of women directors matters: A board with three or more women directors has a much stronger impact on firm performance than a board with one or two women directors, 3) The positive impact of women directors on firm performance is significant among firms controlled by legal person owners but not significant among firms controlled by state owners. This result corroborates the view that legal person owners tend to monitor the listed firms in China more effectively than state owners (Chen, Firth, Gao and Rui, 2006, Sun and Tong, 2003). In sum, this study indicates that in China, women directors {{have a positive impact on}} firm performance, contingent on the ownership structure of listed firms...|$|R
40|$|Newspaper {{circulation}} has to {{be determined}} {{at the level of}} the individual retail outlets for each of the editions to be sold through such outlets. Traditional forecasting methods provide no insight into the impact of the service level defined as the probability that no out-of-stock will occur. The service level results in out-of stock situations, causing missed <b>sales</b> and oversupply <b>or</b> <b>returns.</b> In our application management sets a policy aiming at a 97 percent service level. The forecasting system developed provides estimates for excess deliveries and for the expected shortages. The results compare favorably to the traditional moving average approach previously employed by the publisher. Censored regression is a natural approach to the newspaper problem. It provides information on key policy variables and it is relatively simple to integrate into the distribution policy, with only small adaptations to the existing forecasting and distribution policy.

40|$|In this paper, I propose {{and test}} a simple technology-based theory of firms' sensitivities to {{aggregate}} shocks. I show {{that when the}} elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is below unity, low profitability firms are more sensitive to aggregate shocks, i. e. to the business cycle. Since the wage is smoother than productivity, revenues are more procyclical than costs, making profits, the residual procyclical. Firms with low profitability are more procyclical since the residual is smaller and the amplification greater. I study the asset pricing implications of this technology and find that it can explain the riskiness of small and â€œvalueâ€ firms (Fama and French 1996). These firms are less profitable and are thus more procyclical. I find empirically that the cross-section of expected returns is well explained by differences in sensitivities of firms’ earnings to GDP growth, or by differences in profitability. The model yields rich empirical implications by linking a firm’s real behavior (the elasticity of output, employment and profits to an aggregate shock) to its financial characteristics (the firm's betas and its average return). I next embed my partial equilibrium model in a full DSGE model to conduct a GE analysis. Empirically I show that firms with low margins are indeed {{more sensitive to the}} business cycle in their employment, <b>sales</b> <b>or</b> profitsCross-section of <b>returns,</b> book-to-market, value premium, productivity heterogeneity...|$|R

40|$|Upon an {{authorized}} sale of goods, the owner 2 ̆ 7 s ability {{to recover the}} price from the buyer can be explained either by his property in the goods or by a contractual relationship. This article deals {{with the right to}} recover the price {{in the context of an}} historical and theoretical analysis of the right to the proceeds of a sale at common law. It is suggested that property is the basis of this right, rather than a contractual nexus. Part I presents the sale of goods by an agent of an undisclosed principal as a model situation in which the right of the owner is better explained by a property analysis than by means of the contractual relationship. Part II deals with debt both as an old remedy based on property and as a modern substantive legal relation, and shows how it underlies the owner 2 ̆ 7 s right to recover the price. Part III analyzes the eighteenth-century factor cases that are said to lay down the doctrine of the undisclosed principal; the -discussion is designed to demonstrate the proprietary basis of these cases and to show that they are not governed by a con- tract analysis. Finally, Part IV presents the right of an owner to the cash proceeds of a sale as a continuation of his right against the buyer. The discussion presents the proprietary basis of the right as an explanation of its scope and limits, and illustrates the different effects of sale by factor, by consignee on 2 ̆ 2 <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> <b>return</b> 2 ̆ 2, and by an agent extending credit to the buyer...|$|E

This support is offered through national and international NGOs and technical services which are known as LDI Support Bodies - LDISB. APICA seeks to improve the support LDISBs give to LDIs, {{with which they are}} involved, by helping to resolve their technical, leadership, funding and administrative problems. Apart from training-related activities, APICA also carries out research and studies on development issues, and, in the technological field, develops equipment prototypes. In the field of information and exchange, APICA has two main instruments: - the magazine African Communities, which comes out three times a year. This is an essential means of communication for APICA, containing as it does sections on development activities; technologies; job creation schemes; health issues past and present; recipes; and practical hints. APICA's priority now is to make sure this interesting magazine gets distributed in rural areas. - the Douala Documentation Centre in Cameroon, which could be called a sort of 'information processing plant', turning theoretical knowledge into practical help for potential users. Many books are registered there, and the Centre acquires new ones each year for the 'bookshop' and prepares the files called 'experience storage rooms', which are records on how certain experiments or projects were carried out. The Documentation Service, whose mission is to disseminate information, replies to questions, receives visitors, and arranges the sale of books on a <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> <b>return</b> basis in various regions of Cameroon.

40|$|The {{first sale}} doctrine, codified at 17 U. S. C. § 109, grants {{the owners of}} {{a copy of a}} copyrighted work the right to sell, rent, or lease that copy without {{permission}} from the copyright owner. This doctrine, first endorsed by the Supreme Court in Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, was established {{at a time when the}} owner of a good necessarily had to forego possession in order to sell or lease the item to another. [ [...] . ] The changes in technology and industry over the past two decades threaten to upend this balance. In today 2 ̆ 7 s digital world, an owner of a copy of a copyrighted work need not relinquish his perfect copy in order to sell it. Music, films, software, and video games can be ripped to an owner or lessee 2 ̆ 7 s hard drive and accessed indefinitely in their perfect, as-delivered state even after the <b>sale</b> <b>or</b> <b>return</b> of the physical media upon which the copyrighted content was first accessed. The first sale doctrine does not shelter resale or rental of purely digital copies (where no physical media are involved), but continues to protect the resale and rental of physical copies of digital content even after an individual has archived the material. Innovative rental distribution methods, such as Redbox kiosks and Netflix rental-bymail, have depressed revenue for copyright holders by lowering the costs consumers must pay to access video content. There is little doubt that the public has enjoyed short-term benefits from these changes, but the loss of profits for copyright holders portends a future with less content creation. Technological advancements have occasionally required changes to the first sale doctrine. When audiocassette technology enabled the inexpensive duplication of phonorecords, and when home computers made possible the quick duplication of software, Congress took action to protect the music and software industries by limiting for-profit rentals of those works. It did not, however, extend such protection to the film industry despite the introduction of the VCR. As a result, today individuals can cheaply rent DVDs and Bluray Discs from the likes of Netflix and Redbox, illegally rip the information to their digital home library, and retain this illegal copy long after returning the physical disc. This Note argues that, while the first sale doctrine is not solely responsible for declining home video sales, advancements in technology and industry may require a new approach to the doctrine in order to protect the rights of filmmakers in the digital age. Part I of this Note presents an overview of the first sale doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s origins as well as recent judicial application of the doctrine. Part II suggests legislative solutions that would revise the first sale doctrine in light of recent technological changes. Part III analyzes untested legal strategies that could allow filmmakers to circumvent the first sale doctrine altogether. Part IV concludes that market-based solutions, including increased digital distribution of content under a licensing regime rather than a sale-based regime, are a more realistic path towards promoting the interests of filmmakers and the public than the other suggested approaches...|$|E
