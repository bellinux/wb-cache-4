25|$|Transcription of the reductase gene is {{enhanced}} by the sterol regulatory element binding protein (<b>SREBP).</b> This protein binds to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), located on the 5' end of the reductase gene. When <b>SREBP</b> is inactive, it is bound to the ER or nuclear membrane with another protein called <b>SREBP</b> cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). When cholesterol levels fall, <b>SREBP</b> is released from the membrane by proteolysis and migrates to the nucleus, where it binds to the SRE and transcription {{is enhanced}}. If cholesterol levels rise, proteolytic cleavage of <b>SREBP</b> from the membrane ceases and any proteins in the nucleus are quickly degraded.|$|E
25|$|Biosynthesis of {{cholesterol}} is directly {{regulated by the}} cholesterol levels present, though the homeostatic mechanisms involved are only partly understood. A higher intake from food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas lower intake from food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of intracellular cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum by the protein <b>SREBP</b> (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2). In the presence {{of cholesterol}}, <b>SREBP</b> is bound to two other proteins: SCAP (<b>SREBP</b> cleavage-activating protein) and INSIG-1. When cholesterol levels fall, INSIG-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, which allows the complex to migrate to the Golgi apparatus. Here <b>SREBP</b> is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 protease and site-2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low.|$|E
25|$|The cleaved <b>SREBP</b> then migrates to the nucleus, {{and acts}} as a {{transcription}} factor to bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), which stimulates the transcription of many genes. Among these are the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and HMG-CoA reductase. The LDL receptor scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream, whereas HMG-CoA reductase leads to an increase of endogenous production of cholesterol. A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein in the 1970s. In 1985, they received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work. Their subsequent work shows how the <b>SREBP</b> pathway regulates expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and body fuel allocation.|$|E
50|$|Sterol {{regulatory}} element-binding proteins (<b>SREBPs)</b> are transcription {{factors that}} bind to the sterol regulatory element DNA sequence TCACNCCAC. Mammalian <b>SREBPs</b> are encoded by the genes SREBF1 and SREBF2. <b>SREBPs</b> {{belong to the}} basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper class of transcription factors. Unactivated <b>SREBPs</b> {{are attached to the}} nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. In cells with low levels of sterols, <b>SREBPs</b> are cleaved to a water-soluble N-terminal domain that is translocated to the nucleus. These activated <b>SREBPs</b> then bind to specific sterol regulatory element DNA sequences, thus upregulating the synthesis of enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis. Sterols in turn inhibit the cleavage of <b>SREBPs</b> and therefore synthesis of additional sterols is reduced through a negative feed back loop.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCholesterol {{homeostasis}} {{in animal}} cells {{is achieved by}} regulated cleavage of membrane-bound transcription factors, designated <b>SREBPs.</b> Proteolytic release of the active domains of <b>SREBPs</b> from membranes requires a sterol-sensing protein, SCAP, which forms a complex with <b>SREBPs.</b> In sterol-depleted cells, SCAP escorts <b>SREBPs</b> from ER to Golgi, where <b>SREBPs</b> are cleaved by Site- 1 protease (S 1 P). Sterols block this transport and abolish cleavage. Relocating active S 1 P from Golgi to ER by treating cells with brefeldin A or by fusing the ER retention signal KDEL to S 1 P obviates the SCAP requirement and renders cleavage insensitive to sterols. Transport-dependent proteolysis may be a common mechanism to regulate the processing of membrane proteins...|$|R
40|$|Hepatic {{steatosis}} is {{a common}} histological feature of chronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) gene expression {{has been shown to}} alter host cell cholesterol/lipid metabolism and thus induce hepatic steatosis. Since sterol regulatory element binding proteins (<b>SREBPs)</b> are major regulators of lipid metabolism, we sought to determine whether genotype 2 a-based HCV infection induces the expression and posttranslational activation of <b>SREBPs.</b> HCV infection stimulates the expression of genes related to lipogenesis. HCV induces the proteolytic cleavage of <b>SREBPs.</b> HCV core and NS 4 b derived from genotype 3 a are also individually capable of inducing the proteolytic processing of <b>SREBPs.</b> Further, we demonstrate that HCV stimulates the phosphorylation of <b>SREBPs.</b> Our studies show that HCV-induced oxidative stress and subsequent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -K) -Akt pathway and inactivation (phosphorylation) of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) mediate the transactivation of <b>SREBPs.</b> HCV-induced SREBP- 1 and - 2 activities were sensitive to antioxidant (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate), Ca 2 + chelator 1, 2 -bis(aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester (BAPTA-AM), and PI 3 -K inhibitor (LY 294002).

40|$|Fat-induced hepatic insulin {{resistance}} (FIHIR) in obesity induced by high-fat diet leads to ectopic lipid accumulation and {{may contribute to}} the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. We examined the alterations in hepatic gene expression involved in FIHIR by using obese insulin-resistant and diabetic hamsters that received high-fat diet with or without low-dose streptozotocin. Microarray analysis and confirmatory real-time RT-PCR indicated that increased mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (<b>SREBPs)</b> and decreased mRNA levels of liver X receptor (LXRα) and peroxisome-proliferator–activated receptor (PPARα) occurred in FIHIR in insulin-resistant and diabetic hamsters.

40|$|SummarySterol {{regulatory}} element-binding proteins (<b>SREBPs)</b> are key transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism. To define functional {{differences between}} the three mammalian <b>SREBPs</b> we used genome-wide ChIP-seq with isoform-specific antibodies and chromatin from select tissues of mice challenged with different dietary conditions that enrich for specific <b>SREBPs.</b> We show that hepatic SREBP- 2 binds preferentially to two different gene-proximal motifs. A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis suggests SREBP- 2 targets lipid metabolic processes as expected, but apoptosis and autophagy gene categories were also enriched. We show that SREBP- 2 directly activates autophagy genes during cell-sterol depletion, conditions known to induce both autophagy and nuclear SREBP- 2 levels. Additionally, SREBP- 2 knockdown during nutrient depletion decreased autophagosome formation and lipid droplet association of the autophagosome targeting protein LC 3. Thus, the lipid droplet {{could be viewed as}} a third source of cellular cholesterol, which along with sterol synthesis and uptake, is also regulated by SREBP- 2...|$|R
40|$|We have {{purified}} from hamster liver {{a second}} cysteine protease that cleaves and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins (<b>SREBPs).</b> cDNA cloning revealed that this enzyme is the hamster equivalent of Mch 3, a human enzyme that {{is related to}} the interleukin 1 beta converting enzyme. We call this enzyme Mch 3 /SCA- 2. It is 54 % identical to hamster CPP 32 /SCA- 1, a cysteine protease that was earlier shown to cleave <b>SREBPs</b> at a conserved Asp between the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain and the membrane attachment domain. This cleavage liberates an NH 2 -terminal fragment of approximately 460 amino acids that activates transcription of genes encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor and enzymes of cholesterol synthesis. Mch 3 /SCA- 2 and CPP 32 /SCA-I are synthesized as inactive 30 - 35 kDa precursors that are thought to be cleaved during apoptosis to generate active fragments of approximately 20 and approximately 10 kDa.

50|$|INSIG1 {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the SREBP-mediated regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis: by binding to the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP (<b>SREBP</b> cleavage activating protein) it makes the SCAP/SREBP complex stay longer in the ER, thus prohibiting SCAP from carrying activated <b>SREBP</b> to the golgi complex.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—The {{pathogenesis}} of {{diabetic nephropathy}} {{is complex and}} involves activation of multiple pathways leading to kidney damage.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the rate of fatty acid {{synthesis}} is elevated by more than 20 -fold in livers of transgenic mice that express truncated nuclear forms of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (<b>SREBPs).</b> This was explained in part by an increase in the levels of mRNA for the two major enzymes of fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase, whose transcription is stimulated by <b>SREBPs.</b> Fatty acid syn-thesis also requires a source of acetyl-CoA and NADPH. In the current studies we show that the levels of mRNA for ATP citrate lyase, the enzyme that produces acetyl-CoA, are also elevated in the transgenic livers.

50|$|In {{addition}} to S1P and S2P, the regulated release of transcriptionally active <b>SREBP</b> requires the cholesterol-sensing protein <b>SREBP</b> cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), which forms a complex with <b>SREBP</b> owing to interaction between their respective carboxy-terminal domains. SCAP, in turn, can bind reversibly with another ER-resident membrane protein, INSIG. In {{the presence of}} sterols, which bind to INSIG and SCAP, INSIG and SCAP also bind one another. INSIG always stays in the ER membrane and thus the SREBP-SCAP complex remains in the ER when SCAP is bound to INSIG. When sterol levels are low, INSIG and SCAP no longer bind. Then, SCAP undergoes a conformational change that exposes {{a portion of the}} protein ('MELADL') that signals it to be included as cargo in the COPII vesicles that move from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. In these vesicles, SCAP, dragging <b>SREBP</b> along with it, is transported to the Golgi.

40|$|Cellular {{cholesterol}} homeostasis {{is controlled}} by sterol-regulated proteolysis of membrane-bound transcription factors called sterol-regulatory element binding proteins (<b>SREBPs).</b> CPP 32, a cysteine protease, was shown previously to cleave SREBP- 1 and SREBP- 2 in vitro at an aspartic acid between the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain and the first trans-membrane domain, liberating a transcriptionally active fragment. Here, we show that CPP 32 exists in an inactive 32 kDa form in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. When apoptosis was induced with the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, CPP 32 was cleaved to subunits of 20 and 10 kDa to form the active protease. Under these conditions membrane-bound SREBP- 1 and SREBP- 2 were both cleaved, and the transcriptionally active N-terminal fragments were found in nuclear extracts. Similar results were obtained in human U 937 cells induced to undergo apoptosis by anti-Fas and etoposide. The apoptosis-induced cleavage of <b>SREBPs</b> was not suppressed by sterols, indicating that apoptosis-induced cleavage and sterol-regulated cleavage are mediated by different proteases.

In transfected hamster cells, mutant SCAP in which Asp- 428 is replaced by alanine (D 428 A) remained in an Insig-binding conformation when cells were depleted of sterols. As a result, mutant SCAP failed to dissociate from Insigs, and it failed to carry <b>SREBPs</b> to the Golgi.
