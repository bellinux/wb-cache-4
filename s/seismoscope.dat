40|$|This report {{describes}} the methodology and {{results of the}} use of precariously balanced rocks to study seismic hazard at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, the site of a potential geologic repository for high-level radioactive waste. Precarious rocks are effectively strong-motion <b>seismoscopes</b> that have been in for place thousands of years. Numerous precarious rocks exist in and near Solitario Canyon, Nevada, immediately above the site of the potential repository. Estimates of toppling accelerations using computer models, physical models, and field tests indicate these rocks would be toppled by ground acceleration of a few tenths of the acceleration of gravity (g). Rock-surface age dating using rock varnish layering and cosmogenic age dating indicate that the rocks have been in place tens of thousands of years. Thus, the precarious rock methodology indicates that Yucca Mountain ground accelerations have not exceeded about 0. 3 g for the last several tens of thousands of years. These results are consistent with paleoseismic studies of the Solitario Canyon fault that demonstrate the last significant surface offset capable of producing 0. 3 g at the surface took place 75, 000 to 80, 000 years ago. This report presents recent results of testing, calibration, and application of the precarious rock methodology both at Yucca Mountain and in southern California. In southern California, the seismicity rate is much higher than at Yucca Mountain. Thus, the comparison of results of the precarious rock methodology with Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA) results is easier and more accurate. This lends confidence to the application of the methodology to Yucca Mountain. Preliminary results from these precarious rock studies suggest: (1) Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis using current procedures gives values that are too high at low probabilities (e. g., 102 ̆ 24 annual probabilities). This is true both for Yucca Mountain and for southern California. This is a result of unverified statistical assumptions in PSHA procedures. (2) Current ground-motion estimates for the footwall of major normal faults gives values that are too high. This tends to make the PSHA ground-motion estimates for Yucca Mountain too high. (3) Current ground motion estimates for trans-tensional strike-slip faults are too high. This tends to make the PSHA ground-motion estimates for Yucca Mountain too high. (4) Recent preliminary surface-exposure age dates for the pedestals of precarious rocks at Yucca Mountain are considerably older than some previous estimates. This result tends to confirm the conclusion in (1) above. Although the conclusions of this report have not been formally verified by rigorous peer review, they collectively lend strong support {{to the conclusion that the}} ground-motion estimates resulting from the Yucca Mountain Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA) are too large, perhaps excessively so...|$|R

40|$|The <b>seismoscope</b> is {{a simple}} {{instrument}} designed originally to give a largely qualitative indication of the strong ground motions produced by an earthquake. It consists of a smoked watch glass attached to a two-degree-of-freedom pendulum with a period of Formula sec and damping about 10 per cent of critical; a pen records the pendulum motions on the watch glass. One point on the displacement spectrum of the recorded ground motion at this period and damping is obtained from the measurement of the maximum pendulum excursion. An examination of the <b>seismoscope</b> record obtained on the east abutment of the failed Lower San Fernando dam during the 1971 San Fernando earthquake showed a high-frequency vibration superimposed on the general oscillations. It did not seem likely that this was solely an earthquake vibration component, and shaking table tests of seismoscopes revealed {{the presence of a}} <b>seismoscope</b> vibration mode at frequencies of 15 to 18 Hz depending on the instrument. The oscillations due to this mode on the abutment seismocope record have, therefore, been used as timing marks, to enable the <b>seismoscope</b> equation to be solved for the input acceleration components. The results of the calculations are presented along with analyses of the <b>seismoscope</b> response to indicate the range of applicability. One other record, obtained on a <b>seismoscope</b> alongside a strong-motion accelerograph, was also analyzed for comparison with the recorded accelerations, to demonstrate the validity of the technique. The timing vibration appears on a number of <b>seismoscope</b> records...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for determining the}} local magnitude, M_L, from records from seismoscopes and similar instruments. The technique extrapolates the maximum response of the standard Wood-Anderson seismograph, which determines M_L, from the maximum response of the <b>seismoscope.</b> The standard deviation of the steady-state response of an oscillator subjected to white noise excitation is used to derive a relation correcting for the different periods, dampings, and gains of the two instruments. The accuracy of the method is verified by application to data from the San Fernando and Parkfield earthquakes wherein both accelerograph and <b>seismoscope</b> records {{are available from the}} same sites. The accelerograms are used to synthesize Wood-Anderson responses whose maxima are compared to those extrapolated from the <b>seismoscope</b> data. In both earthquakes, the average magnitudes and standard deviations determined by the two approaches are very nearly equal. The method is then applied to the strong-motion data from the Managua, Nicaragua earthquake of December 23, 1972 (M_S = 6. 2, mb = 5. 6). A value of M_L = 6. 2 is indicated from the <b>seismoscope</b> and accelerograph data. The next application is to the Guatemala earthquake of February 4, 1976 (M_S = 7. 5, mb = 5. 8). The only seismic instrumentation available for determining M_L is a <b>seismoscope</b> record from Guatemala City, which indicates M_L = 6. 9 when a representative distance of about 35 km is used. As a final example, the records obtained during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake Formula from the Ewing duplex pendulum seismograph at Carson City, Nevada and the simple pendulum at Yountville, California are analyzed. After restoring the Carson City instrument, its period and damping were determined experimentally as were the period and damping of a similar instrument in the London Science Museum. On the basis of the strong-motion records from Carson City and Yountville, it is estimated that the local magnitude of the 1906 earthquake lies in the range Formula to 7. The use of <b>seismoscope</b> data further extends the instrumental base from which M_L can be determined and allows the rapid determination of M_L in earthquakes where <b>seismoscope</b> data are available. The applications in this study provide further instrumental evidence for the saturation of M_L in the 7 to Formula range, with the value of 7. 2 for the Kern County earthquake of 1952, the largest so far determined...|$|E
40|$|More {{information}} about ground motion can be extracted from <b>seismoscope</b> records {{than a single}} point on a response spectrum. To demonstrate this, the relation between <b>seismoscope</b> response and Wood-Anderson instrument output and peak horizontal ground velocity has been studied by simulating the various responses {{for a range of}} distances and magnitudes. The simulations show that the relation used by Jennings and Kanamori (1979) to convert from peak seis-moscope readings to the peak response of a Wood-Anderson instrument has a distance- and magnitude-dependent systematic error. The error is negligible, however, for modern seismoscopes at distances of a few tens of kilometers. At several hundred kilometers, the relation underestimates the Wood-Anderson response by as much as a factor of two. The spread in Jennings and Kanamori's estimate of M, for the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, recorded on seismoscopes having relatively low natural frequencies (0. 26 and 0. 5 Hz), is reduced by the results in this paper [...] the upper value, from a <b>seismoscope</b> in Carson City...|$|E

40|$|The San Fernando Earthquake of February 9, 1971 {{occurred}} virtually at {{the center}} of the Southern California strong-motion earthquake instrumentation network, and provided an unprecedented amount of valuable data on strong earthquake -generated ground motions, This data will be of key significance in interpreting the severe damage to many modern engineering structures which occurred, and marks a major development in the field of earthquake engineering. It was evident immediately after the event that the problems of recovering field records, of processing the information, and of disseminating the results as quickly and as widely as possible would severely tax the available resources. Fortunately, the close cooperation which had been built up over the years between the Seismological Field Survey of the U. S. Department of Commerce and the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology provided an operating group which could be quickly expanded to meet the challenge. In the days and weeks following the earthquake, each of these organizations issued numerous preliminary reports aimed at the quickest possible distribution of information. The present report up-dates and brings together a number of these initial releases, along with much new material. It is hoped that in this way a more complete picture of the overall instrumentation results can be presented in one convenient place. The report also makes available for the first time a complete description of the Southern California networks, and a detailed account of the performance of these networks during the earthquake, A notable feature of the present report is the reproduction in accurate scale form of the complete set of <b>seismoscope</b> records obtained during the earthquake. These <b>seismoscope</b> records offer an unparalleled picture of the complexity of the pattern of ground shaking throughout the Southern California region. The primary purpose of the present compilation is to make available the basic data itself, and no attempt has been made to add interpretive material. Many interpretive studies have, of course, already been made, and the full exploitation of this basic data to increase our knowledge of earthquake engineering will no doubt go on for a number of years. In reporting the accelerograph measurements, numerous examples of accelerograms have been given, and samples of standard data processing procedures leading to digitized print-outs and calculated velocity and displacement curves, and response spectrum curves, have been included. The complete set of accelerograms in computer -plotted form, along with the digital print-outs, are being issued by the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology as a part of the series "Strong-Motion Earthquake Accelerograms - Digitized and Plotted Data. " The first volume devoted to the San Fernando earthquake has already been issued as Vol. 1, part C, Report No. EERL 71 - 20. These volumes of digitized accelerograms will be followed during the next year by additional volumes containing integrated ground velocity and displacement curves, and response spectrum curves, which will be prepared for all of the records obtained during the San Fernando earthquake. The existence of this unusually complete ground motion data is a tribute to the cooperative efforts of a large number of people over a period of many years. Many of the individuals involved have been named in the acknowledgements included in the separate sections. Hundreds of individual accelerograph and <b>seismoscope</b> owners have pooled their resources to make the Southern California region the best instrumented area in the world for strong earthquake ground motion investigations. A complete list of organizations, building owners, and others who deserve thanks for making possible the acquisition and the operation of the instruments would be an imposing indication of the extent of the cooperative effort involved. Special mention should be -made of the very important contributions of the late John C. Monning, former general manager and superintendent of the Department of Building and Safety of the City of Los Angeles. It was Mr, Monning's vision and foresight, implemented with great energy and patience, which resulted in the code requirements for accelerographs in tall buildings which made this earthquake the most extensive structural dynamic test of full-scale buildings ever carried out. His colleagues and successors in the Department of Building and Safety have carried this work forward in a very effective manner, and have thus played a key role in the development of the accelerograph network...|$|E
40|$|The Mw 7. 0 {{destructive}} {{earthquake that}} struck the Republic of Haiti on January 12, 2010 {{was one of}} the deadliest of the last century in the region. What has been concluded after a field study during the period from 16 th to 22 nd of January 2010 is that this event is mostly a man-made natural disaster. This is due to the very adverse social, political and economic conditions that existed before the earthquake that greatly contributed to the lack of any building-construction code and control of land use and the lack of any governmental-public services during the post-earthquake emergency. The primary effects of the earthquake were worsened due to the inability or absence of any preparedness for search and rescue and help the victims. The frozen response of the structures to the seismic event, observed during the field trip, gave valuable information about the ground motion, since instrumental records were unavailable. The response of a fence functioning as a primitive <b>seismoscope</b> was analyzed, resulting to an effective ground horizontal acceleration of about 0. 6 to 0. 7 g. Similarities between Haitian structures and their response with instrumented cases in other regions, resulted in the acceptance of a 1. 0 g vertical acceleration for the site. Finally, the detailed investigation of the whole liquefaction phenomenon at the site, documented that this is starting with ejection of sand and water, before the large ground displacements take place and continues after the strong phase of the ground motion...|$|E
