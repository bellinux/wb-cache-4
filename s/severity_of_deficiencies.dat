40|$|International audienceDEFINITION: Congenital {{hypopituitarism}} {{is characterized}} by multiple pituitary hormone deficiency, including somatotroph, thyrotroph, lactotroph, corticotroph or gonadotroph deficiencies, due to mutations of pituitary transcription factors involved in pituitary ontogenesis. INCIDENCE: Congenital hypopituitarism is rare compared with {{the high incidence of}} hypopituitarism induced by pituitary adenomas, transsphenoidal surgery or radiotherapy. The incidence of congenital hypopituitarism is estimated to be between 1 : 3000 and 1 : 4000 births. CLINICAL SIGNS: Clinical presentation is variable, depending on the type and <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and on the age at diagnosis. If untreated, main symptoms include short stature, cognitive alterations or delayed puberty. DIAGNOSIS: A diagnosis of combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) must be suspected when evident causes of hypopituitarism (sellar tumor, postsurgical or radioinduced hypopituitarism [...] .) have been ruled out. Clinical, biological and radiological work-up is very important to better determine which transcription factor should be screened. Confirmation is provided by direct sequencing of the transcription factor genes. AETIOLOGY: Congenital hypopituitarism is due to mutations of several genes encoding pituitary transcription factors. Phenotype varies with the factor involved: PROP 1 (somatolactotroph, thyrotroph, gonadotroph and sometimes corticotroph deficiencies; pituitary hyper and hypoplasia), POU 1 F 1 (somatolactotroph and thyrotroph deficiencies, pituitary hypoplasia), HESX 1 (variable pituitary deficiencies, septo-optic dysplasia), and less frequently LHX 3 (somatolactotroph, thyrotroph and gonadotroph deficiencies, limited head and neck rotation) and LHX 4 (variable pituitary deficiencies, ectopic neurohypophysis, cerebral abnormalities). MANAGEMENT: An appropriate replacement of hormone deficiencies is required. Strict follow-up is necessary because patients develop new deficiencies (for example late onset corticotroph deficiency in patients with PROP 1 mutations). GENETIC COUNSELLING: Type of transmission varies with the factor and the mutation involved (recessive transmission for PROP 1 and LHX 3, dominant for LHX 4, autosomal or recessive for POU 1 F 1 and HESX 1). PROGNOSIS: It is equivalent to patients without pituitary deficiencies if treatment is started immediately when diagnosis is confirmed, and if a specialized follow-up is performed...|$|E
