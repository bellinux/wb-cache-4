2500|$|The {{forest of}} Skule {{has always been}} a {{topographic}} barrier. For example, it would have perhaps have been the northern frontier of the kingdom of Svealand before the year 1000, and thus the border between adjacent municipalities and parishes. The villages it separated had very limited contact with each other and, because of the poor agricultural potential of the forest, there was never a permanent settlement in the forest. The forest was, however, traversed by a trail, which later took the name of Kustlandsvägen and which corresponded roughly to the path of today's European route E4. For a long time, this path constituted the only road {{to the north of the}} country. The zone was thus the property of the Swedish crown, which could decide who could use the forest as pasture or engage in logging there. In the 17th century, unlike many of the northern Swedish forests belonging to the crown, Skuleskogen did not see any colonization by the Forest Finns (...) , and thus did not undergo <b>slash-and-burn</b> <b>cultivation</b> techniques. The forest was instead used as a summer pasture (transhumance), and the hay of the marshes was used as well, although in a very localized fashion. As a result, in today's national park there were four summer pasture cottages, three having existed up until the turn of the 20th century, while the last (Näskebodarna) remained active up until the end of World War II. This last is now used, maintained in its old state, for tourism. The forest would seem to be more open in those days than now.|$|E

For cattle trading, mithun and other cattle were procured from Burma. The trade was based on barter system, which worked well because the different villages specialized in different areas.

50|$|Most farmers employ {{one of two}} {{cultivation}} systems: {{either the}} wet-field paddy system, practiced primarily in the plains and valleys, or the <b>slash-and-burn</b> <b>cultivation</b> system, practiced primarily in the hills. These systems are not mutually exclusive, especially among the Lao Loum or lowland Lao in areas remote from major river valleys (see Lowland Lao Society, ch. 2). <b>Slash-and-burn</b> <b>cultivation</b> was practiced by approximately 1 million farmers in 1990, who grew mostly rice on about 40 {{percent of the total}} land area planted to rice.|$|E

In order to design more sustainable yam cropping systems, agronomy research in Benin has implemented trials in partnership with smallholders on alternative yam-based systems using shrubby (Gliricidia sepium) and herbaceous (Aeschynomene histrix) legumes. In the first phase, farmers modified these new systems within their own constraints; the systems were then further evaluated. The agronomic and economic performance of farmer-adapted alternative yam-based cropping systems and the implications for wider international application are discussed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the major}} instigators of human-wildlife {{conflict}} is competition for space. Destruction of forests through logging, encroachment, <b>slash-and-burn,</b> shifting <b>cultivation,</b> and monoculture tree plantations are major threats {{to the survival of}} elephants. Human-elephant conflicts occur when elephants raid crops of shifting cultivators in fields, which are scattered over a large area interspersed with forests. Depredation in human settlements is another major area of human-elephant conflict occurring in small forest pockets, encroachments into elephant habitat, and on elephant migration routes. Studies in Sri Lanka indicate that traditional slash-and-burn agriculture creates optimal habitat for elephants by creating a mosaic of successional-stage vegetation. Populations inhabiting small habitat fragments are much more liable to come into conflict with humans.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a theoretical framework}} to analyse land quality and labour allocation decisions by poor rural households {{in the context of}} increased population densities in <b>slash-and-burn</b> (shifting <b>cultivation)</b> agro-ecosystems. A bio-economic optimal control model is presented and its results calibrated with data from two farming communities from Yucatan (Mexico). The ecological-economic model restates the validity of the neo-Malthusian 'Population Pressure Hypothesis' (PPH) as a major factor of land degradation. It is pointed out that 'fallow crises' may be overcome when the production elasticity of total farm labour is sufficiently high compared to the elasticity of substituion between farm labour and soil quality. Calibration of the model also suggests that the strategy by poor households is to allocate more labour to clearing forestland when population densities increase, hence adding to 'population pressure' on the forest commons.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the origins of}} the {{northern}} Congo Republic rainforests. Macroscopic charcoal fragments were systematically recorded through auger investigations and pits observations in four forest types: the open canopy Marantaceae forest, the dense forest with Marantaceae, the Gilbertiodendron dewevrei forest and the Triplochiton scleroxylon forest. In addition, the charred Elaies guineensis seeds were distinguished from the other charcoals in the pits. Ten selected charcoals, including charred E. guineensis seeds, were dated by AMS. Abundance of charcoal fragments in the soils at various depths indicated several episodes of fires in the region. A dryer climatic phase, between 2320 and 1330 BP, associated with a large scale human occupation related to the important harvesting of oil palm nuts, could explain the widespread Marantaceae forests. Recent <b>slash-and-burn</b> shifting <b>cultivation,</b> c. 200 BP, would allow T. scleroxylon installation. Implications for forest management are discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|R

25|$|A {{major threat}} to forests of India are in its northeastern states. From ancient times, the locals have practiced <b>slash-and-burn</b> {{shifting}} <b>cultivation</b> to grow food. Locally called Jhum, it supports about 450,000 families in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Assam and Meghalaya. Approximately 15,000 square kilometers of forest land is under jhum cultivation, and just a sixth of this land is actually producing any crop at any given year. The tribal people consider it a tradition, and economic ecosystem. However, the slash and burn causes damage to a dense forest, to soil, to flora and fauna, as well as pollution. The crop yields are very poor with jhum cultivation. Between 2010 and 2012, satellite studies confirmed {{a net loss of}} forest cover over these northeastern states. The lost forest includes primary dense forests. There is a concerted effort by the state government officials to educate, incentivize and train jhum dependent families to horticulture and other high value crops, along with an offer of food supply security. Bamboo-based textiles and value added forest products industries are also being encouraged by the local officials. States such as Arunachal Pradesh reported reduction in Jhum cultivation practice in 2013.|$|R
