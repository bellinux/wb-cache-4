500|$|Because of the game's popularity, {{rumors about}} {{glitches}} and secrets spread rapidly after its release. A common rumor was that Luigi {{was a secret}} character in the game, fueled by illegible symbols in the castle courtyard that were said to resemble the text [...] "L is real 2401". This same texture would reappear in [...] on a plaque in Dodongo's Cavern. IGN received <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>questions</b> and supposed methods to unlock Luigi that the staff offered a [...] reward to anyone who could prove that Luigi was in the game. The number of false codes submitted to IGN dropped dramatically, as Luigi's inclusion was {{proved to be a}} myth. The April Fools' Day 1998 issue of Nintendo Power claims that the cryptic phrase would be discussed on the non-existent page 128, and also features a facetious article titled [...] "Luigi 64", commenting humorously on the rumor. Several players have discovered coins that were impossible to obtain without glitching the game. Scott Buchanan, under the alias pannenkoek2012, had managed to collect one of those coins in 2014 without tool-assistance, and also creates content about the programming mechanics of Super Mario 64.|$|E

However, Fickett questioned what direction the show would go now that <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>questions</b> have been resolved. Jay Black of TV Squad said the conflict between Michael and his co-workers was very good, and he enjoys the way Phyllis revealed how hurt she was by Michael's departure from the company; however, Black said he did not like that the episode included a [...] "Casual Friday" [...] even though the office had never had one before. Rick Porter of Zap2it said the supporting characters {{were all in}} top form and that the episode demonstrated how Michael, in offering a genuine apology, has grown this season. Porter also praised the scenes with Jim and Creed, and described Kate Flannery as [...] "one of the most fearless actresses on TV" [...] for her scene with the short bathing suit. Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune called the episode [...] "yet another winner in what's shaping up to be a terrific last third of the season".|$|E

Dexter {{is one of those}} shows. [...] " [...] and summarized with [...] "The pilot episode did an extremely good job hooking us into the world of Dexter. We are meant to feel confused by his actions, and only time will tell how the show deals with this topic - will Dexter ever go too far, making us turn on our protagonist? There are <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>questions</b> that we have about this show, and that is a good thing. Personally we cannot wait to see how long this game of cat-and-mouse goes on with the unknown serial killer and Dexter. With the solid introduction to the series, characters, and future storylines, we can't help but recommend Dexter to anybody that is at all curious about the show. [...] " [...] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler later placed Mike Donovan third on a list of [...] "Dexter's Top 10 Kills", saying [...] "We all remember our first. First car. First love. First staph infection. And when it comes to Dexter, first kill. No Mike Donovan, the church choir master, wasn't Dexter first dead body, but he was our televisual introduction into Dexter's wicked world of revenge and reckoning." [...] IGN also declared the show as the [...] "Best New Psycho Drama of 2006".|$|E

500|$|Mark Madley of the National Post {{praised the}} episode for [...] " [...] the near-perfect season four". He asked [...] "has there ever been an episode that {{answered}} <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>questions</b> yet advanced the plot so little?", but immediately {{noted that the}} question was not negative. He also found Jin's line [...] "I will hunt you down and rip your head off!" [...] particularly humorous. Tim Goodman, critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, thought highly of the romantic plot of the episode, and more generally the characters of Jin and Sun, noting that [...] "Lost has always treated the Jin and Sun relationship with both interest and respect" [...] and [...] "few primetime televised portrayals of intimacy among Asians have been this well done." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide stated that the episode made him cry, the [...] "ultimate compliment in the Roush playbook". Later in his review, he commented he was [...] "already a puddle of emotion before the climactic reveal". In comparison, the TMZ.com staff gave a largely negative review. The reviewer thought that [...] " [...] feel like [...] purposely manipulated us with Jin's flashback and the reveal really wasn't even all that interesting as a result. And the reveal of Michael being {{the man on the}} boat was as un-suspenseful as it was predictable", and thought Sun's request for Jin to be at her bedside was deceptive, and rehashed Jack Shephard's (Matthew Fox) comment about his deceased father in [...] "Through the Looking Glass". Television Without Pity's LTG gave the episode an [...] "A-", called it [...] "trippy" [...] and [...] "confusing" [...] and also praised Yunjin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim's performances as [...] "fantastic".|$|E

[...] Director Jesper W.

Writer Matthew Graham said, [...] "Kathleen Moon is an unwitting bomb in Redwater and creating the debris from her explosive arrival is what drew me to this project."

Redwater {{is described as a}} [...] "very little romantic seaside town", and [...] "a tiny, picturesque Irish harbour village, a quiet rural idyll by the sea where the Kelly and Dolan families have lived for generations." [...] The then executive producer of EastEnders, also executive producer of Redwater, Dominic Treadwell-Collins, said that two events in EastEnders serve as a catalyst for the series. In EastEnders episodes broadcast in April, May and December 2015 and January 2016, Kat and Alfie win the lottery, Alfie discovers he has a mass in his brain and Kat discovers she gave birth to a son, Luke, after she passed out during the birth of her daughter Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan); Luke was adopted by a family in Ireland without Kat knowing he existed. Kat's sister Belinda Peacock (Carli Norris) recalls a time the family (minus Kat) went to Redwater and they conclude that Luke must be there.
