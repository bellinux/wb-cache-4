2500|$|The near-total {{emphasis}} on large apartment blocks {{was a common}} feature of Eastern Bloc cities in the 1970s and 1980s. East German authorities viewed large cost advantages {{in the construction of}} Plattenbau apartment blocks such that the building of such architecture on the edge of large cities continued until the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. [...] These buildings, such as the Paneláks of Czechoslovakia and Panelház of Hungary, contained cramped concrete apartments that broadly lined Eastern Bloc streets, leaving the visitor with a [...] "cold and grey" [...] impression. [...] Wishing to reinforce {{the role of the state}} in the 1970s and 1980s, Nicolae Ceaușescu enacted the <b>systematization</b> <b>programme,</b> which consisted of the demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, in order to make place to standardized apartment blocks across the country (blocuri). Under this ideology, Ceaușescu built Centrul Civic of Bucharest in the 1980s, which contains the Palace of the Parliament, in the place of the former historic center.|$|E
50|$|She {{argued for}} freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of {{assembly}} and freedom of travel; on the economic side, her letter (which may have been drafted by other collaborators) argued for closing down loss-making factories, re-tooling factories {{for being able to}} compete with foreign companies, hiring foreign managers and recreation of private land ownership, as well as the stopping of the <b>Systematization</b> <b>programme.</b>|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} drastic {{reconstruction}} policies of the Eastern Bloc was the <b>systematization</b> <b>programme</b> {{that took place in}} the 1970s and 1980s under Nicolae Ceaușescu in Romania. During this period, after Ceaușescu visited in 1971 North Korea and was impressed by the Juche ideology of that country, he enacted a mass programme of demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, in order to build blocks of flats (blocuri).|$|E
5000|$|Prior to {{starting}} to demolish the old historical town of Bucharest {{in order to}} build Centrul Civic, Bucharest (and other cities and towns throughout the country) had already suffered communist reconstruction, particularly in the 1970s, under the <b>systematization</b> <b>programme</b> which consisted of the demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, in order to make place to standardized blocks of flats (blocuri), after Ceauşescu got this idea during a 1971 visit in North Korea's which exposed him to Juche ideology. The construction of Centrul Civic and the demolitions necessary for it, however, were quite extreme even compared to other reconstruction communist programmes.|$|E

5000|$|In Romania, free-ranging urban dogs (called in Romanian câini maidanezi, {{literally}} [...] "wasteland dogs", câini comunitari [...] "community dogs", etc.) {{have been}} a huge problem in recent decades, especially in larger cities, with many people being bitten by dogs. The problem originates primarily in the <b>systematization</b> <b>programme</b> {{that took place in}} Communist Romania in the 1970s and 1980s under Nicolae Ceaușescu, who enacted a mass programme of demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, in order to build standardized blocks of flats (blocuri). The dogs from the yards of the demolished houses were abandoned on the streets, and reproduced, multiplying their numbers throughout the years. Estimations for Bucharest vary widely, but the number of stray dogs has been reduced drastically in 2014, after the death of 4-years old child in 2013 who was attacked by a dog. The Bucharest City Hall stated that over 51,200 stray dogs were captured from October 2013 to January 2015, with more than half being euthanized, about 23,000 being adopted, and 2,000 still residing in the municipality's shelters.|$|E
5000|$|In the Eastern Bloc, {{tower blocks}} were {{constructed}} {{in great numbers}} to produce plenty of cheap accommodation for the growing postwar populations of the USSR and its satellite states. This took place mostly in the 50s, 60s and 70s of the 20th century, though in the People's Republic of Poland this process started even earlier due to the severe damages that Polish cities sustained during World War II. Throughout the former Eastern Bloc countries, tower blocks built during the Soviet years make up much of the current housing estates {{and most of them}} were built in the specific socialist realist style of architecture that was dominant in the territories east of the Iron Curtain. In Romania, mass construction of standardized apartment blocks occurred under the <b>systematization</b> <b>programme</b> of Nicolae Ceaușescu, who, after a 1971 visit in North Korea, was impressed by the Juche ideology of that country [...] Systematization consisted largely of the demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, in order to build blocks of flats (blocuri). In the Czech Republic and Slovakia (then Czechoslovakia), panelák building under communism resulted from two main factors: the postwar housing shortage and the ideology of communist Czechoslovak leaders.|$|E
