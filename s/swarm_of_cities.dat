It was a license tax-- license to work his claim--and it had to be paid before he could begin digging.|$|R

60|$|Now {{certainly}} one of the first impressions of America, or at any rate of New York, which {{is by no means the}} same thing as America, is that of a sort of mob of business men, behaving in many ways in a fashion very different from that <b>of</b> the <b>swarms</b> <b>of</b> London <b>city</b> men who go up every day to the city. They sit about in groups with Red-Indian gravity, as if passing the pipe of peace; though, in fact, most of them are smoking cigars and some of them are eating cigars. The latter strikes me as one of the most peculiar of transatlantic tastes, more peculiar than that of chewing gum. A man will sit for hours consuming a cigar as if it were a sugar-stick; but I should imagine it to be a very disagreeable sugar-stick. Why he attempts to enjoy a cigar without lighting it I do not know; whether it is a more economical way of carrying a mere symbol of commercial conversation; or whether something of the same queer outlandish morality that draws such a distinction between beer and ginger beer draws an equally ethical distinction between touching tobacco and lighting it. For the rest, it would be easy to make a merely external sketch full of things equally strange; for this can always be done in a strange country. I allow for the fact of all foreigners looking alike; but I fancy that all those hard-featured faces, with spectacles and shaven jaws, do look rather alike, because they all like to make their faces hard. And with the mention of their mental attitude we realise the futility of any such external sketch. Unless we can see that these are something more than men smoking cigars and talking about dollars we had much better not see them at all.|$|R

30|$|Due {{to these}} challenges, the control <b>of</b> {{autonomous}} <b>swarms</b> <b>of</b> UAVs {{is a relatively}} new phenomenon. The Naval Post-Graduate School in Monterey, California, flew a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> 50 UAVs controlled by a single operator in 2015 as part of their Zephyr system. At the time, this event is believed to have set the world record for the most UAVs under single operator control (Hambling, 2015). The use <b>of</b> <b>swarms</b> <b>of</b> UAVs to aid in post-disaster assessment was imagined in 2016, in a report describing a human-machine interface to control the UAV swarm.|$|R
5000|$|Another large set of {{applications}} may be solved using <b>swarms</b> <b>of</b> micro air vehicles, {{which are also}} broadly investigated nowadays. In comparison with the pioneering studies <b>of</b> <b>swarms</b> <b>of</b> flying robots using precise motion capture systems in laboratory conditions, current systems such as Shooting Star can control teams of hundreds of micro aerial vehicles in outdoor environment using GNSS systems (such as GPS) or even stabilize them using onboard localization systems where GPS is unavailable. [...] <b>Swarms</b> <b>of</b> micro aerial vehicles have been already tested in tasks of autonomous surveillance, plume tracking, and reconnaissance in a compact phalanx. [...] Numerous works on cooperative <b>swarms</b> <b>of</b> unmanned ground and aerial vehicles have been conducted with target applications of cooperative environment monitoring, convoy protection, and moving target localization and tracking.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{presents}} novel {{structures for}} optimization and communication <b>of</b> a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> mobile sensors or robots for maximizing {{local and global}} tasks such as firefighting, landmine detection, radioactivity detection, etc. The navigation of the sensors is carried out using two strategies. The first strategy is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the second strategy {{is based on a}} <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> fuzzy logic based controllers. In addition, the membership functions and the rules of the Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) are optimized using the PSO algorithm. Navigation of mobile sensors is considered in this paper to locate desirable target sources in a given sensing area. Both approaches presented do not depend on the number of target sources. Results are provided for target locations based on a PSO, a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> fuzzy logic controllers and a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> optimized fuzzy logic controllers...|$|R
40|$|Since {{humans and}} robots often share workspaces and {{interact}} with each other to complete tasks cooperatively, as is the case, for example, in automated warehouses and assembly lines, much of the focus has been centered on supporting human interactions with one or a few robots. As the number of robots involved in a task grows large, scalable abstractions are needed to support interactions with larger numbers of robots. Consequently, there has been a growing effort to understand human-swarm interactions (HSIs) and devise abstractions that are amenable to having humans interact with <b>swarms</b> <b>of</b> robots easily and effectively. In this dissertation, we investigate what it means to impose a control structure on a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> robots for the purpose of supporting a specific HSI, when such a control structure is suitable for allowing a user to solve a particular task with a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> robots, how one can evaluate attention and effort required to interact with a <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> robots through a particular control structure, how well attention and effort scale as the number of robots in the swarm increases, why some <b>swarms</b> <b>of</b> robots are easier to interact with than others under the same type of control structure, how to select an appropriate swarm size, and how to design new input controllers for interacting with <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> mobile robots. Consequently, this dissertation provides a comprehensive framework for characterizing, understanding, and designing the control structures of new abstractions that will be amenable to humans interacting with <b>swarms</b> <b>of</b> networked mobile robots, as well as, a number of examples of such old and new abstractions investigated under this framework.
