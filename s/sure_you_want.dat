2500|$|Norris {{circulated}} {{the cartoon}} to bloggers based in Seattle, Washington. She sent {{a copy of}} her illustration to Dan Savage, who posted it on his blog on April 22. On April 23, she was interviewed by Dave Ross of KIRO, a local Seattle radio station. Norris responded to a question [...] "Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do this?", and said [...] "Yeah, I want to water down the targets ... as a cartoonist I just felt so much passion about what had happened, I wanted to counter Comedy Centralâ€™s message about feeling afraid." [...] The motivation for the protest was not simply to defend the South Park creators, but also to support the {{right to free speech}} under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She also said, [...] "it's a cartoonist's job to be non-PC." [...] On her website, Norris stated that the idea was not to disrespect Islam, but to support everybody's freedom of expression.|$|E
2500|$|Nikkatsu {{had started}} its SM line of Roman porno films in 1974 with the hits Flower and Snake and Wife to Be Sacrificed both {{featuring}} actress Naomi Tani {{and directed by}} Masaru Konuma. After this first highly successful venture into sexual violence, the studio's output became increasingly rougher. According to director Yasuharu Hasebe, by 1976 the studio {{was looking for a}} new direction, and contacted him to develop films in a new style to be called [...] "Violent Pink". These would be comparable to the U.S. [...] "roughies" [...] film genre, violent and misogynistic, but without the whips, bondage and other traditional accoutrements of the S genre. Hasebe had worked with the studio in the 1960s during their [...] "Nikkatsu Action" [...] era, but was not comfortable with the pink film genre to which the studio had turned with the inception of the Roman porno series in 1971. Reluctant to work in the sex film genre, Hasebe later recalled warning the studio, [...] "Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me?... You must be aware-- my craft is very bloody." ...|$|E
2500|$|So Jason Clarke is my {{public defender}} {{at the time}} and he's warning me. He's saying, [...] "Lindsey don't take drug court. I'm telling you, you won't make it." [...] He's told me this like three or four times. I'm adamant. I'm saying, [...] "I'm taking drug court." [...] Because all I know is I get to get out of jail. It's all I know. I don't know {{anything}} else about it. So I go to plead into drug court. My dad's in the court room. Judge Barton was on the bench that day instead of Judge Williams. She was gone. My dad's done Judge Barton's accounting for probably the past 15 years and they're very good friends. So (Judge Barton) sees me come in and he pulls me up to the bench and he's like, [...] "Don't do this. Don't take drug court. Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do this?" [...] He asked me three or four times. Judge Barton's trying to talk me out of taking drug court. That I would not do well. I wouldn't make it. He didn't think it was what I should do.|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{wants to}} marry you. Now, {{it seems to me}} that seven weeks is very short {{acquaintance}} for a decision like that. Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} other, smiling, [...] "you seem to {{understand}} how our city bosses fix these things. But my job will mean pretty tough work. Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> quite <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> us this evening? Wouldn't {{you rather}} be alone? Just say the word, and we'll clear {{out like a}} shot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is right," [...] Mr. Penrose said, relieved. [...] "Nelly, {{you may as}} well {{leave the}} basket as it is. I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> to carry it back again?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Senators manager Mickey Vernon later {{wanted to}} make a change, {{reportedly}} asking the pitcher: [...] "Your arm okay? <b>You</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> me to take you out?", to which Cheney replied [...] [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, dearie," [...] she said, [...] "Dinah {{brought you}} water and wine and tings to eat. Here is {{a cup of}} water, I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it. Let me lift you up to drink it." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{meanwhile}} she {{had called}} out: [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to know Mr. Overt. You'll be great friends, and {{it will always be}} delightful to me to remember I was here when you first met and that I {{had something to do with}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] was the answer. [...] "'Tis more direct, you see, no shoals, and {{the young}} gentlemen will get to their own homes and beds all the quicker. Now, miss, you {{will come in and}} take a cup of tea, I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it, and I had just made it when Norris saw the little lads." ...|$|E
6000|$|She now {{came and}} stood {{close to him}} and took his hand. [...] "I hope, papa, you do not make {{yourself}} uneasy about me. I shall do very well. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> can't <b>want</b> me to go away and leave you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{positive}} wealth," [...] Letitia acknowledged, [...] "but I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> me really, and I haven't the least inclination to get married, and heaven knows {{what would happen}} to dad if I let him go back to bachelor apartments!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is right, lad. Ah, here is supper. I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> must <b>want</b> {{it after}} being {{eighteen}} {{hours on the}} outside of a coach in such weather as this, though I daresay as far as food went you did not do badly." ...|$|R
6000|$|Instantly Walter's face lighted with pleasure. [...] "Will you? Are you <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to?" [...] he cried. [...] "The {{boys have}} {{heard so much}} about you that they will be tickled silly to have a real, live, sure enough guide from the woods with them. We were {{planning}} to go out to Bronx Park and try a little winter woodcraft and----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you very}} <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me? Are you not {{tired of the}} thorn that has fretted you so long? Remember, I am so young, so ignorant, and unfitted for a wife. Can I give you real happiness? make home {{what you would have}} it? and never see in your face regret that some wiser, better woman was not in my place?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I don't {{think he}} wants to drive,' Bud says, considerin'. An' the rube says quick, 'You betcher life I do.' 'You're dead <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> that job?' I says. Yes, he's dead sure. Nothin's goin' to keep him away from that job. Why, that job's what he come to town for, an' we can't lead him to it too quick.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! but my heart's {{set upon}} it," [...] she said; [...] "I shouldn't be happy unless I did it, and I'm <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> {{to make me}} unhappy, now. You must get me some lawyer here, Martin; I'm afraid you're not lawyer enough for that yourself." ...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{bittersweet}} {{moment in}} Cobb's life reportedly {{came in the}} late 1940s, when he and sportswriter Grantland Rice were returning from the Masters golf tournament. Stopping at a Greenville, South Carolina, liquor store, Cobb noticed that {{the man behind the}} counter was none other than [...] "Shoeless" [...] Joe Jackson, who had been banned from baseball almost 30 years earlier following the Black Sox scandal. But Jackson did not appear to recognize him, and after making his purchase an incredulous Cobb asked, [...] "Don't you know me, Joe?" [...] "I know you", replied Jackson, [...] "but I wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to speak to me. A lot of them don't." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1933, the Jacksons {{moved back}} to Greenville, South Carolina. After first opening a {{barbecue}} restaurant, Jackson and his wife opened [...] "Joe Jackson's Liquor Store", which they operated until his death. One of the better known stories of Jackson's post-major league life took place at his liquor store. Ty Cobb and sportswriter Grantland Rice entered the store, with Jackson showing no sign of recognition towards Cobb. After making his purchase, the incredulous Cobb finally asked Jackson, [...] "Don't you know me, Joe?" [...] Jackson replied, [...] "Sure, I know you, Ty, but I wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to know me. A lot of them don't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{been in a}} tremble {{for three}} days, because {{it seemed as if}} it couldn't be {{possible}} that so much happiness was coming to me. Are you quite <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me, John?" [...] asked Dolly, careless for once of her cherished treasures; for she had been busy with hopes and fears, while he was attending to more material affairs.|$|E
6000|$|... (2) Very ready {{we are to}} say of a book, [...] "How {{good this}} is--that's exactly what I think!" [...] But the right feeling is, [...] "How strange that is! I {{never thought of that}} before, and yet I see it is true; or if I do not now, I hope I shall, some day." [...] But whether thus submissively or not, at least be sure that you go to the author to get at HIS meaning, not to find yours. Judge it {{afterwards}} if you think yourself qualified to do so; but ascertain it first. And be sure, also, if the author is worth anything, that you will not get at his meaning all at once;--nay, that at his whole meaning you will not for a long time arrive in any wise. Not that he does not say what he means, and in strong words too; but he cannot say it all; and what is more strange, will not, but in a hidden way and in parables, in order that he may be <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it. I cannot quite see the reason of this, nor analyse that cruel reticence in the breasts of wise men which makes them always hide their deeper thought. They do not give it you by way of help, but of reward; and will make themselves sure that you deserve it before they allow you to reach it. But it is the same with the physical type of wisdom, gold. There seems, to you and me, no reason why the electric forces of the earth should not carry whatever there is of gold within it at once to the mountain tops, so that kings and people might know that all the gold they could get was there; and without any trouble of digging, or anxiety, or chance, or waste of time, cut it away, and coin as much as they needed. But Nature does not manage it so. She puts it in little fissures in the earth, nobody knows where: you may dig long and find none; you must dig painfully to find any.|$|E
