40|$|Portulacaria afra (L.) Jacq. is a {{perennial}} facultative CAM species showing a seasonal shift from C 3 to <b>CAM</b> photosynthesis. The <b>shift</b> to <b>CAM</b> {{during the summer}} occurs despite continued irrigation of the plants. The authors examined {{the hypothesis that the}} seasonal <b>shift</b> to <b>CAM</b> occurred because of low transient water potentials. They measured changes in whole leaf water, osmotic and pressure potentials {{over the course of the}} shift. They also studied changes in enzyme activity to ascertain if PEP carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase were induced during the seasonal <b>shift</b> to <b>CAM.</b> Water potentials were high, from - 0. 1 to - 0. 5 MPa, predawn and midday, when the C 3 pathway of photosynthesis was utilized. Osmotic potentials were constant, from - 0. 7 to - 0. 8 MPa, indicating very little change in turgor. P. afra <b>shifted</b> to <b>CAM</b> indicated by large diurnal acid fluctuations (300 400 meq m− 2) despite C 3 -like predawn water potentials. Midday water potentials usually decreased 0. 2 - 0. 7 MPa, while the osmotic potential remained unchanged or decreased slightly. Thus, a midday loss of turgor was associated with the use of the CAM pathway. The results support the hypothesis that the induction of CAM occurred due to low transient water potentials and may be partially mediated through the loss of turgor. The <b>shift</b> to <b>CAM</b> is only a partial induction with PEP carboxykinase showing high activity all year round while PEP carboxylase increases three-to five-fold over C 3 levels. Relatively high levels of CAM enzyme activity enables the utilization of the CAM pathway in the winter and spring in response to high daytime temperatures and increased evaporative demand. These results would lead to an increase in water use efficiency during such periods when compared to other inducible CAM species...|$|R

Irrigated P. afra plants were utilizing the CAM pathway {{throughout the summer}} and shifted to C 3 during the winter and spring. Beginning in September, P. afra plants <b>shifted</b> from <b>CAM</b> to CAM-idling after 2 months of water-stress. When water-stress was initiated later in the fall, exogenous CO 2 uptake was still measurable after 4 months of drought. After 7. 5 months of stress, exogenous CO 2 uptake was absent. The <b>shift</b> from <b>CAM</b> to CAM-idling or C 3 {{in the fall and}} winter was related to when water stress was initiated and not to the duration of the stress. Gas exchange resumed within 24 h of rewatering regardless of the duration of the drought. In the winter and spring, rewatering resulted in a full resumption of daytime CO 2 uptake. Whereas during the summer, rewatering quickly resulted in early morning CO 2 uptake, but nocturnal CO 2 uptake through the CAM pathway was observed after 7 days. Gas exchange measurements, rewatering characteristics, and transpirational water loss support the hypothesis that the C 3 pathway was favored during the winter and spring. The CAM pathway was functional during the summer when potential for water loss was greater. Our investigations indicate that P. afra has a flexible photosynthetic system that can withstand long-term drought and has a rapid response to rewatering...|$|R

We investigated whether CAM evolution can be associated with the availability of new or alternative niches, using Eulophiinae orchids as a case study. Carbon isotope ratios, geographical and climate data, fossil records and DNA sequences were used to: assess the prevalence of CAM in Eulophiinae orchids; characterize the ecological niche of extant taxa; infer divergence times; and estimate whether CAM is associated with niche <b>shifts.</b> <b>CAM</b> evolved in four terrestrial lineages during the late Miocene/Pliocene, which have uneven diversification patterns. These lineages originated in humid habitats and colonized dry/seasonally dry environments in Africa and Madagascar. Additional key features (variegation, heterophylly) evolved in the most species-rich CAM lineages. Dry habitats were also colonized by a lineage that includes putative mycoheterotrophic taxa. These findings indicate that the switch to CAM is associated with environmental change. With its suite of adaptive traits, this group of orchids represents a unique opportunity to study the adaptations to dry environments, especially in the face of projected global aridification...|$|R

While in the past its use was mainly driven by consumer goods and electronic applications by Asian manufacturers such as notebook computer cases, digital camera bodies, chain saw housings, etc., currently Thixomolding® has been widely extended to other applications. Some examples are in automotive and sports equipment, such as automotive <b>shift</b> <b>cams,</b> bicycle saddles, fishing reels, snowboard bindings, etc. Wider applications of Thixomolding® magnesium alloys mainly depend on various advantages such as a simple and completely automatic manufacturing process, high productivity, and repeatability of the mechanical properties of parts. Moreover, due to low molding temperatures and laminar flow of the semisolid injected material, longer die life and dimensional precision are expected. In addition, complex geometry and net shape forming are possible, thus avoiding any further machining. Finally, residual porosity, {{which is one of}} the typical defects of cast parts due to gas entrapment in turbulent flow, is avoided because of the laminar flow injection molding in tool-die.

An acidity flux of 130 to 150 microequivalents per gram fresh weight was evident by 41 days. Between 40 and 90 days, the leaves shifted their CO 2 uptake pattern from a daytime to a nighttime peak.

40|$|The facultative {{halophyte}} Mesembryanthemum crystallinum {{responds to}} osmotic stress by switching from C 3 photosynthesis to Crassulacean acid metabolism (<b>CAM).</b> This <b>shift</b> to <b>CAM</b> involves the stress-initiated up-regulation of mRNAs encoding CAM enzymes. The {{capability of the}} plants to induce a key CAM enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, is influenced by plant age, {{and it has been}} suggested that adaptation to salinity in M. crystallinum may be modulated by a developmental program that controls molecular responses to stress. We have compared the effects of plant age on the expression of two salinity-induced genes: Gpdl, which encodes the photosynthesis-related enzyme glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, and Imtl, which encodes a methyl transferase involved in the biosynthesis of a putative osmoprotectant, pinitol. Imtl mRNA accumulation and the accompanying increase in pinitol in stressed Mesembryanthemum exhibit a pattern of induction distinct from that observed for CAM-related genes. We conclude that the molecular mechanisms that trigger Imtl and pinitol accumulation in response to salt stress in M. crystallinum differ in some respects from those that lead to CAM induction.

Two well studied species, A gave shawii and A. deserti, are native to arid environments in southern California, while A. colimana and A. dasyliroides are native to a seasonally moist tropical region in western Mexico. Over {{the course of}} six weeks, transpiration rates and stomatal conductance during regular watering, drought, and recovery were measured using a porometer. Measurements were taken during daylight and after dark to observe the periods of highest photosynthetic activity. To further investigate the relationship between photosynthesis and environment, stomatal impressions were taken to determine during which hours the stomata opened to allow for transpiration. The data collected by the porometer and stomatal impressions suggest that under well watered conditions A. dasyliroides employs C 3 photosynthesis, with a tendency to <b>shift</b> towards <b>CAM</b> photosynthesis under more stressful conditions. These results contrast with the other species investigated {{where there was no}} significant difference between photosynthesis during the night and day.

40|$|Calmodulin {{has long}} been {{suspected}} {{to be involved in}} calcium-regulated exocytosis but its precise site(s) of action has not yet been identified. In Paramecium, a genetic approach to the problem is possible as in vivo-selected mutations in the calmodulin gene that prevent the activation of some channels have been characterized. Three of these calmodulin mutants were examined for exocytotic capacity and the mutant cam 1 was found to be defective for exocytosis at 35 degrees C. The loss of exocytotic capacity in cam 1 cells can be restored by transformation with the wild-type calmodulin gene, demonstrating that its exocytotic lesion is indeed due to the mutation in the calmodulin gene. The cam 1 mutant displays abnormal exocytotic sites at the non-permissive temperature: it lacks the links ('rosettes' of intramembranous particles in the plasma membrane and the fibrous 'connecting material') which normally connect plasma and trichocyst membranes. Upon <b>shift</b> of <b>cam</b> 1 cells from the permissive to a non-permissive temperature, performed sites remain functional.

The Ca 2 +-dependent interactions of calmodulin (CaM) with its target proteins play {{an essential role}} in a variety of cellular functions. In this study, we investigated the interactions of G protein beta gamma subunits with CaM. We found that CaM binds to known beta gamma subunits and these interactions are Ca 2 +-dependent. The CaM-binding domain in Gbeta gamma subunits is identified as Gbeta residues 40 - 63. Peptides derived from the Gbeta protein not only produce a Ca 2 +-dependent gel mobility <b>shifting</b> of <b>CaM</b> but also inhibit the CaM-mediated activation of CaM kinase II. Specific amino acid residues critical for the binding of Gbeta gamma to CaM were also identified. We then investigated the potential function of these interactions and showed that binding of CaM to Gbeta gamma inhibits the pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Galpha o subunits, presumably by inhibiting heterotrimer formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that interaction with CaM has little effect on the activation of phospholipase C-beta 2 by Gbeta gamma subunits, supporting the notion that different domains of Gbeta gamma are responsible for the interactions of different effectors. These findings shed light on the molecular basis for the interactions of Gbeta gamma with Ca 2 +-CaM and point to the potential physiological significance of these interactions in cellular functions...|$|R

40|$|Agaves {{exhibit the}} water-conserving crassulacean acid {{metabolism}} (CAM) photosynthetic pathway. Some species are potential biofuel feedstocks because they are highly productive in seasonally dry landscapes. In plants with CAM, high growth rates are often believed {{to be associated with}} a significant contribution of C 3 photosynthesis to total carbon gain when conditions are favourable. There has even been a report of a <b>shift</b> from <b>CAM</b> to C 3 in response to overwatering a species of Agave. We investigated whether C 3 photosynthesis can contribute substantially to carbon uptake and growth in young and mature Agave angustifolia collected from its natural habitat in Panama. In well-watered plants, CO 2 uptake in the dark contributed about 75 % of daily carbon gain. This day/night pattern of CO 2 exchange was highly conserved under a range of environmental conditions and was insensitive to intensive watering. Elevated CO 2 (800 ppm) stimulated CO 2 fixation predominantly in the light. Exposure to CO 2 -free air at night mark-edly enhanced CO 2 uptake during the following light period, but CO 2 exchange rapidly reverted to its standard pat-tern when CO 2 was supplied during the subsequent 24 h. Although A.  angustifolia consistently engages in CAM as its principal photosynthetic pathway, its relatively limited photosynthetic plasticity does not preclude it from occupying a range of habitats, from relatively mesic tropical environments in Panama to drier habitats in Mexico...|$|R
40|$|The carbon isotope {{composition}} of the halophyte Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L. (Aizoaceae) changes when plants are exposed to environmental stress and when they shift from C 3 to crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). We examined the coupling between carbon isotope composition and photosynthetic pathway by subjecting plants of different ages to salinity and humidity treatments. Whole shoot d 13 C values became less negative in plants that were exposed to 400 mM NaCl in the hydroponic solution. The isotopic change had two components: a direct NaCl effect that was greatest in plants still operating in the C 3 mode and decreased proportionally with increasing levels of dark fixation, and a second component related {{to the degree of}} CAM expression. Ignoring the presumably diffusion related NaCl effect on carbon isotope ratios results in an overestimation of nocturnal CO 2 gain in comparison to an isotope versus nocturnal CO 2 gain calibration established previously for C 3 and CAM species grown under well-watered conditions. It is widely taken for granted that the <b>shift</b> to <b>CAM</b> in M. crystallinum is partially under developmental control and that CAM is inevitably expressed in mature plants. Plants, cultivated under non-saline conditions and high relative humidity (RH) for up to 63 days, maintained diel CO 2 gas-exchange patterns and d 13 C values typical of C 3 plants. However, a weak CAM gas-exchange pattern and an increase in d 13 C value were observed in non-salt-treated plants grown at reduced RH. These observations are consistent with environmental control rather than developmental control of the induction of CAM in mature M. crystallinum under non-saline conditions...|$|R
40|$|Calcineurin (CN) is {{a highly}} conserved Ca[superscript 2 +]–calmodulin (CaM) -dependent {{phosphatase}} that senses Ca[superscript 2 +] concentrations and transduces that information into cellular responses. Ca[superscript 2 +] homeostasis is disrupted by α-synuclein (α-syn), a small lipid binding protein whose misfolding and accumulation is a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. We report that α-syn, from yeast to neurons, leads to sustained highly elevated levels of cytoplasmic Ca[superscript 2 +], thereby activating a CaM-CN cascade that engages substrates that result in toxicity. Surprisingly, complete inhibition of CN also results in toxicity. Limiting the availability of <b>CaM</b> <b>shifts</b> CN's spectrum of substrates toward protective pathways. Modulating CN or CN's substrates with highly selective genetic and pharmacological tools (FK 506) does the same. FK 506 crosses the blood brain barrier, is well tolerated in humans, and is active in neurons and glia. Thus, a tunable response to CN, which has been conserved for a billion years, can be targeted to rebalance the phosphatase’s activities from toxic toward beneficial substrates. These findings have immediate therapeutic implications for synucleinopathies.

Field observations indicated that the plant survives the long dry season and acquires a red stem colour under high irradiance and protracted drought. Our work aimed at investigating survival of this arido-active species in its natural habitat by studying diurnal and seasonal changes in stomatal conductance, cell sap acidity, and chlorophyll fluorescence.

Previously, {{it was shown}} that when grown under good water conditions, it is a typical CAM plant, but when water stressed, it shifts to a dampened form of CAM, termed CAM-idling, in which stomata are closed day and night but with a continued, low diurnal organic acid fluctuation. We have now studied the kinetics of some metabolic features of the <b>shift</b> from <b>CAM</b> to CAM-idling under severe water stress and the recovery upon rewatering. When water is withheld, there is a steady decrease in relative water content (RWC), reaching about 50 %, {{at which point the}} water potential decreases precipitously from about - 2 or - 3 bars to - 12 bars. Abscisic acid (ABA) increases sharply at about 75 % RWC. Stomata close, which limits CO 2 uptake, and there is a dampened diurnal organic acid fluctuation typical of CAM-idling. Throughout an extended stress period to 50 % RWC, there is no change in chlorophyll, protein, and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase activity compared with the well-watered plants. Despite the fact that the tissue was already in CAM, the stress is accompanied by an increase in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc) mRNA, extractable PEPc activity, and PEPc protein (such that the specific activity remained approximately constant) and a decrease in the apparent Km(PEP). It is not known if the changes in Km(PEP) in response to drought are related to or are separate from the increases in PEPc protein and mRNA. The changes in Km(PEP) could be in response to the decreased endogenous levels of organic acids, but evidently are not an assay artifact. The increases in PEPc protein and mRNA appear {{to be related to the}} water-stress treatment and may result from the increased concentration of ABA or the decreased levels of endogenous organic acids.

Despite their structural similarity, endothelial NOS (eNOS) has a 6 -fold lower NO synthesis activity and 6 – 16 -fold lower cytochrome c reductase activity than neuronal NOS (nNOS), implying significantly different electron transfer capacities. We utilized purified reductase domain constructs of either enzyme (bovine eNOSr and rat nNOSr) {{to investigate the}} following three mechanisms that may control their electron transfer: (i) the set point and control of a two-state conformational equilibrium of their FMN subdomains; (ii) the flavin midpoint reduction potentials; and (iii) the kinetics of NOSr-NADP+ interactions. Although eNOSr and nNOSr differed in their NADP(H) interaction and flavin thermodynamics, the differences were minor and unlikely to explain their distinct electron transfer activities. In contrast, calmodulin (CaM) -free eNOSr favored the FMN-shielded (electron-accepting) conformation over the FMN-deshielded (electron-donating) conformation to a much greater extent than did CaM-free nNOSr when the bound FMN cofactor was poised in each of its three possible oxidation states. NADPH binding only stabilized the FMN-shielded conformation of nNOSr, whereas <b>CaM</b> <b>shifted</b> both enzymes toward the FMN-deshielded conformation.

A CAM is a memory unit that process single clock cycle content matching instead of addresses using well dedicated comparison circuitry. Most mismatches {{can be found}} by searching a few bits of a search word. The most critical design challenge in CAM is to reduce power consumption associated with reduced area and increased speed. To lower power dissipation, a word circuit is often divided into two sections that are sequentially searched or even pipelined. Because of this process, most of match lines in the second section are unused. Since searching the last few bits is very fast compared to searching {{the rest of the}} bits, throughput can be increased by asynchronously initiating second-stage searches on the unused match lines as soon as a firststage search is complete. A reordered overlapped search mechanism for high throughput low energy content addressable memories (CAMs) is the existing method.

Linear advection terms have dipolar pattern in the Atlantic (negative NW of positive) which reflects the <b>shift</b> of the <b>CAM</b> 3 model North Atlantic storm track (NAST) into Europe, especially in the upper troposphere; opposite sign dipolar structure occurs over Alaska (positive) and the north Pacific storm track (negative).

To investigate fundamental photosyntheticpatterns and the induction of pattern <b>shifts</b> (C 3, <b>CAM,</b> C 3 -CAM etc.) {{as a result of}} environmental stresses, wemeasured the water content, diurnal changes in pH, net CO 2 exchange, transpiration rate, total ionic contents,and osmolality of Kalancoe daigremontiana, Sedum kamschaticum and Sedum sarmentosum which belong toCrassulaceae known as representative CAM plant, after 10 days of drought treatment. S. kamschaticum and S. sarmentosum did not show a significant difference in diurnal pH variation in thetreatment and control conditions. However, the pH of drought-treated Kalancoe was low at night and high inthe daytime, with a pH value between 4 and 5. Typical CAM plants display a net CO 2 exchange that increasesat night and decreases in the daytime. Kalancoe displayed the predicted pattern. However, S. kamschaticum andS. sarmentosum showed a photosynthetic pattern more typical of C 3 plants, and did not show changes inphotosynthetic pattern under drought stress. Kalancoe also showed a transpiration rate typical for CAM photosynthesis,whereas the transpiration rates of S. kamschaticum and S. sarmentosum were in the typical rangefor C 3 photosynthesis. Kalancoe had high total ionic contents during the night, which decreased somewhat duringthe daytime, whereas S. kamschaticum and S. sarmentosum displayed the opposite pattern. This result is similarto the diurnal patterns of changes in pH in the three plant species, which suggests a relationship between pHand ionic contents. S. sarmentosum showed lower osmolality under drought stress than in the control condition,whereas the osmolality of Kalancoe and S. kamschaticum did not differ between conditions. S. sarmentosummay have maintained internal water content by lowering its osmolality and raising its total ionic contents. In conclusion, Kalancoe displayed the characteristic responses of a typical CAM plant, whereas S. kamschaticum and S. sarmentosum displayed aspects of the C 3 photosynthetic pattern under drought conditions. These results suggest that S. kamschaticum and S. sarmentosum (Crassulacea) in Korea overcome droughtstress by increasing solute and ionic contents internally rather than changing their photosynthetic pattern fromC 3 to CAM under drought stress...|$|R

Quantitative analysis of the different phospho-(Y) CaM species suggests that the relative phosphorylation of Y 99 and Y 138 in wild type CaM by both the EGFR and c-Src is different than the respective phosphorylation of either Y 99 in CaM(Y 138 F) or Y 138 in CaM(Y 99 F). © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Information Detection Hardware System {{plays an}} {{important}} role in search engines or matching systems such as text search, pattern matching, image matching, face detection and many others. The objective of this dissertation is to design an ultra-fast parallel information detector for search systems employing <b>CAM</b> and <b>SHIFT</b> circuits to enhance search performance of the systems. This structure has not been proposed by other research works. CAM is designed basing on 2 -port RAM blocks on FPGA. The CAM design, which is flexible and effective on various FPGA platforms, returns multi-match values in parallel. The search systems are designed for 1 -D data and 2 -D data basing on CAM. The proposed system for 1 -D data has a simple structure. It consists of multiple <b>CAM</b> blocks and <b>SHIFT</b> circuits operating in parallel. The results are determined by an AND logic circuit. The proposed system architecture for 2 -D data is similar to the 1 -D data system. However, in the 2 -D data system, the system only employs one <b>CAM</b> block, one <b>SHIFT</b> circuit, OR logic circuit, AND logic circuit and an FSA to control the system operations. The purposes of the FSA are to save logic resources, and to circulate each input and distance value of query data to the single <b>CAM,</b> <b>SHIFT,</b> OR and AND logic circuit. The 2 -D data system can be used for exact image matching or approximate image matching with the corresponding search patterns. The search pattern is defined as a combination of query data inputs and their distance values. The search pattern is applied to the system for data detection or pattern matching. There are search patterns for 1 -D data and 2 -D data. Besides, the multi-core system is also proposed by combining many search cores with a 16 -bit DSP. Each core can be the proposed system on 1 -D data or 2 -D data operating in parallel. The DSP independently works with the single search cores, controls the system, and performs calculation of search results for specific applications. By combined with the DSP, performance of data detection and processing of the system is improved. In general, the proposed systems have simple structures and do not use any complex computations or micro-processors for searching data. This increases the search performance, saves the least search time and clock cycles. The advantage of the proposed systems is ultra-fast search time by employing parallel structures and CAM 2 ̆ 7 s multi-match values in concurrence. The search time of the 1 -D data system is mainly consumed by <b>CAM</b> blocks, <b>SHIFT,</b> AND circuits. In the 2 -D data system, the search time is the number of inputs multiplied by executive clock cycles of <b>CAM</b> block, <b>SHIFT,</b> OR, AND circuits. The search time of the proposed systems is the fastest among all systems. The proposed systems can be used as a common accelerator for a variety of applications such as text search, temperature analysis, DNA sequence search (1 -D data); face detection, pattern matching, pattern recognitions, authentication with watermarking, motion detection (2 -D data); stereoscopy applications (3 -D data) and so on. The proposed systems are implemented on FPGA in advance for functional verification then designed on an ASIC to make sure that the systems can operate on a physical chip. There are 2 full chips which are successfully implemented by using 0. 18 m CMOS technology, and 1 chip is designed on 65 nm SOI technology. One of them is dedicated to the 1 -D data system with 0. 18 m CMOS technology, and the other ones are designed for the 2 -D data systems with 0. 18 m CMOS technology and low power 65 nm SOI technology. Finally, the proposed systems for 1 -D data and 2 -D data have been successfully implemented on hardware in both FPGA and ASIC. The systems are designed using digital design flow. They can be exported under IP cores which independently operate on hardware platforms (FPGA or ASIC). Some applications of the systems have been developed on FPGA boards and presented in this dissertation to demonstrate the system operations in practical situations. 電気通信大学 201...|$|R
