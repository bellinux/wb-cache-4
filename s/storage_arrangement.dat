50|$|Overall product {{improvement}} {{in the areas of}} survivability, RAM, and armament. This includes increased armor, redesigned (safer) internal <b>storage</b> <b>arrangement</b> for ammunition and equipment, engine and suspension upgrades, and {{product improvement}} of the M284 cannon and M182A1 mount. The greatest difference is the integration of an inertial navigation system, sensors detecting the weapons' lay, automation, and an encrypted digital communication system, which utilizes computer controlled frequency hopping to avoid enemy electronic warfare and allow the howitzer to send grid location and altitude to the battery fire direction center (FDC). The battery FDCs in turn coordinate fires through a battalion or higher FDC. This allows the Paladin to halt from the move and fire within 30 seconds with an accuracy equivalent to the previous models when properly emplaced, laid, and safed—a process that required several minutes under the best of circumstances. Tactically, this improves the system's survivability by allowing the battery to operate dispersed by pairs across the countryside and allowing the howitzer to quickly displace between salvos, or if attacked by indirect fire, aircraft, or ground forces.|$|E

2500|$|Until the 1970s, {{the scrolls}} {{continued}} to deteriorate {{because of poor}} <b>storage</b> <b>arrangements,</b> exposure to different adhesives, and being trapped in moist environments. Fragments written on parchment (rather than papyrus or bronze) {{in the hands of}} private collectors and scholars suffered an even worse fate than those {{in the hands of the}} museum, with large portions of fragments being reported to have disappeared by 1966. In the late 1960s, the deterioration was becoming a major concern with scholars and museum officials alike. Scholars John Allegro and Sir Francis Frank were some of the first to strongly advocate for better preservation techniques. Early attempts made by both the British and Israel Museums to remove the adhesive tape ended up exposing the parchment to an array of chemicals, including [...] "British Leather Dressing," [...] and darkening some of them significantly. In the 1970s and 1980s, other preservation attempts were made that included removing the glass plates and replacing them with cardboard and removing pressure against the plates that held the scrolls in storage; however, the fragments and scrolls continued to rapidly deteriorate during this time.|$|R

40|$|Frequently, {{the supply}} of {{building}} materials to the construction site is fraught with difficulties that can {{have a significant effect}} on productivity. Major productivity gains are possible, particularly if the building process is planned from a logistics perspective. The concept of logistics was developed initially within the manufacturing industry, and now constitutes an important management tool to ensure an overall strategic perspective on the flow of materials in the production process. This paper contends that logistics are relevant also to the construction industry, and describes the development of a logistics model to manage the flow of materials from suppliers to installation on-site and its application to a Danish house building project. The case study evidence suggests that the primary focus of the logistics concept in construction is to improve co-ordination and communication between project participants during the design and construction phases, particularly in the materials flow control process. The logistics concept requires accurate scheduling of materials to programmed delivery dateskeyed to actual site layout and <b>storage</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The logistics approach also involves a new role for materials suppliers, including early involvement in the design phase and overall responsibility for the flow of information relating to materials...|$|R

40|$|Worldwide, {{a variety}} of {{approaches}} to the management of spent fuel have been adopted. A review of approaches adopted internationally was undertaken to inform decision making on spent fuel management in UK. The review surveyed spent fuel storage and disposal practices, standards, trends and recent developments in 16 countries and carried out more detailed studies into the evolution of spent fuel storage and disposal strategies in four countries. The review highlighted that: (1) spent fuel management should be aligned to the national policy for final dispositioning of the fuel; (2) national spent fuel <b>storage</b> <b>arrangements</b> should deliver efficiency across all spent fuel management activities; (3) commercial and financial arrangements should ensure that spent fuel management decisions do not unnecessarily limit future fuel handling, packaging and disposal activities; (4) extended storage of spent fuel prior to packaging provides increased flexibility {{in the design of}} future packaging and disposal concepts. Storage of spent fuel over 100 [*]years or more using existing technologies is technically feasible and operationally credible.

40|$|A {{review of}} experimental/computational studies {{to enhance the}} thermal {{conductivity}} of phase change materials (PCM) that were conducted over many decades is presented. Thermal management of electronics for aeronautics and space exploration {{appears to be the}} original intended application, with later extension to storage of thermal energy for solar thermal applications. The present review will focus on studies that concern with positioning of fixed, stationary high conductivity inserts/structures. Copper, aluminum, nickel, stainless steel and carbon fiber in various forms (fins, honeycomb, wool, brush, etc.) were generally utilized as the materials of the thermal conductivity promoters. The reviewed research studies covered a variety of PCM, operating conditions, heat exchange and thermal energy <b>storage</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The energy <b>storage</b> vessels included isolated thermal storage units (rectangular boxes, cylindrical and annular tubes and spheres) and containers that transferred heat to a moving fluid medium passing through it. A few studies have focused on the marked role of flow regimes that are formed due to the presence of thermally unstable fluid layers that in turn give rise to greater convective mixing and thus expedited melting of PCM. In general, it can be stated that due to utilization of fixed high conductivity inserts/structures, the conducting pathways linking the hot and cold ends must be minimized.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the current practices of segregation approaches, <b>storage</b> <b>arrangements,</b> collection and disposal {{systems in the}} teaching hospitals of Karachi. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in eight teaching hospitals of Karachi, using convenient sam-pling technique. The instrument of research was a self administered questionnaire, with four sections, relating to the general information of the institution, administrative information, information regarding Health Waste Management personnel and a check-list of Hospital Waste Management activities. Results: Out of eight hospitals visited 2 (25 %) were segregating sharps, pathological waste, chemical, infec-tious, pharmaceutical and pressurized containers at source. For handling potentially dangerous waste, two (25 %) hospitals provided essential protective gears to its waste handlers. Only one (12. 5 %) hospital arranged training sessions for its waste handling staff regularly. Five (62. 5 %) hospitals had storage areas but mostly it was not protected from access of scavengers. Five (62. 5 %) hospitals disposed off their hazardous waste by burning in incinerators, two (25 %) disposed off by municipal landfills and one (12. 5 %) was burning waste in open air with-out any specific treatment. No record of waste was generally maintained. Only two (25 %) hospitals had well doc-umented guidelines for waste management and a proper waste management team. Conclusion: There should be proper training and management regarding awareness and practices of waste disposal. Research must be undertaken to seal existing gaps in the knowledge about hospital waste manage-ment.
