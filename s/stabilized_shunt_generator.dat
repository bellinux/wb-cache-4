A direct current (DC) generator, not using a permanent magnet, requires a DC field current for excitation. The field may be separately excited by a source of DC, such as a battery, or self excited by being connected to the armature of the generator so that the generator also provides the energy required for the field current.|$|R

Introduction: The {{generator}} tested is in {{the power}} plant of the Manhattan Ice, Light and Power Company, Manhattan, Kansas. Its regular work is to carry the lighting load {{during the second half}} of the night. It is belt driven by a 14 ” x 21,” Erie City, simple, non-condensing engine of one hundred and fifty horse power capacity at ninety five pounds steam pressure. The engine’s normal speed is one hundred and seventy eight revolutions per minute. The power is transmitted by a pulley nine feet, three inches in diameter to a twenty one inch pulley on the generator shaft. The generator is manufactured by the General Electric Company, Schenectady, New York. It is the revolving field, stationary armature type and is self-excited from a direct current <b>shunt</b> <b>generator</b> carried on the same shaft. The armature windings of the alternator are of the distributed, “Barrel” type. The core is of cast steel punchings laid together with suitable ducts to insure good ventilation through all parts. The coils are from wound and are laid on the core and held in place by beach wood wedges, which are driven into slots over the coils. This allows the speedy removal of damaged coils. As the armature is stationary, the insulation can be made more secure. It these machines the armature insulation is required to withstand four or five times the normal working pressure...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{steady-state}} operation of a radial EHVAC cable transmission system with multiple power injection points, e. g. offshore wind farms, and variable <b>shunt</b> compensation. <b>Generator</b> voltages and variable compensation settings are determined {{by means of a}} power flow-based algorithm, aiming at symmetrical current magnitude profiles along individual cable lines (CLs) : the proposed operation minimizes Joule losses and maximizes cable line (CL) exploitation. Network code constraints on the reactive power exchanged with the bulk power system are also considered. Successful application to a hypothetical 199 km long, 400 kV- 50 Hz cable system collecting up to 2 GW from several OWFs is presented, showing that the proposed operation ensures at least 97 % transmission efficiency at full load, with near-unity generator power factor values. Moreover, possible constraints due to sending end voltage rise at full load suggest the implementation of voltage control at the network connection point...|$|R
30|$|Traditionally, {{the voltage}} in {{transmission}} and distribution networks has been regulated through dispatch of active and reactive powers from stand-alone centralized plants. <b>Generators,</b> <b>shunt</b> capacitors, STATCOMs, and SVCs collaborate to maintain the voltage within limits under every load condition. Theoretically, the voltage control can be performed {{in a similar way}} in distribution networks based on a management system controller with costly communication equipment. The increasing distributed and local power injection in medium voltage (MV) and LV grids alters the network operation and intensify the concerns regarding the bidirectional power flow effect in voltage control.|$|R

During the test voltages and currents at <b>shunt</b> capacitor and <b>generator</b> terminals are digitised, recorded and thereafter off-line processed. Two adaptive methods are applied for signal processing: the Newton-Type Algorithm (NTA) and the Adaptive Fourier Filter (AFF) Scheme. The features of both methods during nominal frequency conditions and severe frequency changes and signal distortions are investigated. It is proved that the adaptive approach proposed is well suited for voltage and current measurements when the signal frequency changes in a wide range...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{low-temperature}} electron transport in two-dimensional electron systems with a one-dimensional, atomically precise, strong short-period modulation, called surface superlattices. The short periodicity of the modulation leads {{to the formation of}} minibands separated by minigaps for the transport perpendicular to the modulation potential. In analogy to usual semiconductor superlattices the miniband transport is described in terms of Bloch oscillations leading to negative differential conductivity and a possible realization of a THz Bloch oscillator with these structures is discussed. In particular it is shown that the lower dimensionality of the structure changes the dynamics of electric field instabilities. The small ratio of width to length for the two-dimensional system leads to a decrease of the growth factor of charge domains by the same ratio, which means that surface superlattices exhibit a greater stability towards the formation of charge domains. Moreover, a so called shunted surface superlattice structure is realized. In such a system an additional transport channel is directly attached {{to the side of the}} active superlattice. In the described approach this can be done with an atomically precise interface. The parallel transport channel is expected to act as a drain for charge carrier fluctuations that would lead to electric field instabilities in the neighbouring superlattice. And indeed it is shown that the shunted surface superlattice shows the perfect negative differential conductivity expected for a superlattice with a homogeneous electric field alignment. This means that the discussed system is the first realization of a superlattice with homogeneous electric field at high electron densities and makes it a very promising candidate for a possible THz solid state oscillator. A two-dimensional transport model is developed that allows to directly extract the transport parameters from the experimental data. With these numbers the THz gain in the structure can be approximated. Experimental evidence for the claimed <b>shunt</b> <b>stabilized</b> surface superlattice is given in terms of magnetic field dependent current-voltage characteristics. The homogeneity of the electric field is shown through the observation of Stark-cyclotron resonances and the claim of domain free high-density superlattice transport is proven through a detailed discussion of the transport in the surface superlattice in crossed electric and magnetic fields. Besides magnetic field dependent measurements also the DC transport in GHz and THz electromagnetic fields is analyzed with respect to the question whether a THz oscillator might be realized. Finally, the last part of the thesis {{deals with the}} linear response transport measurements in dependence of a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron system. The observed magnetoresistance oscillations are discussed both in terms of semiclassical and quantum-mechanical models. A conclusive connection between the experimental data and the theory of the integer quantum Hall effect in such structures is established. The magnetoresistance measurements also confirm the calculated miniband structures that were used as input for the Bloch oscillation studies...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we develop inverse {{scattering}} algorithms towards {{the ultimate goal}} of online diagnostic methods. The aim is to detect structural changes inside power transformers and other major power grid components, like <b>generators,</b> <b>shunt</b> reactors etc. Power grid components, such as large power transformers, are not readily available from the manufacturers as standard designs. They are generally optimized for specific functions at a specific position in the power grid. Their replacement is very costly and takes a long time. Online methods for the diagnostics of adverse changes of the mechanical structure and the integrity of the dielectric insulation in power transformers and other power grid components, are therefore essential for the continuous operation of a power grid. Efficient online diagnostic methods can provide a real-time monitoring of mechanical structures and dielectric insulation in the active parts of power grid components. Microwave scattering is a candidate that may detect these early adverse changes of the mechanical structure or the dielectric insulation. Upon early detection, proper actions to avoid failure or, if necessary, to prepare for the timely replacement of the damaged component can be taken. The existing diagnostic methods lack the ability to provide online reliable information about adverse changes inside the active parts. More details about the existing diagnostic methods, both online and offline, and their limitations {{can be found in the}} licentiate thesis preceding the present PhD thesis. We use microwave scattering together with the inverse scattering algorithms, developed in the present work, to reconstruct the shapes of adverse mechanical structure changes. We model the propagation environment as a waveguide, in which measurement data can be obtained only at two ends (ports). Since we want to detect the onset of some deformation, that only slightly alters the scattering situation (weak scattering), we have linearized the inverse problem with good results. We have calculated the scattering parameters of the waveguide in the first-order perturbation, where they have linear dependencies on the continuous deformation function. A linearized inverse problem with a weak scattering assumption typically results in an ill-conditioned linear equation system. This is handled using Tikhonov regularization, with the L-curve method for tuning regularization parameters. We show that localized one-dimensional and two-dimensional shape deformations, for rectangular and coaxial waveguide models, are efficiently reconstructed using the inverse scattering algorithms developed from the first principles, i. e. Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism. An excellent agreement is obtained between the reconstructed and actual deformation shapes for a number of studied cases. These results show that it is possible to use the inverse algorithms, developed in the present thesis, as a theoretical basis for the design of a future diagnostic device. As a part of the future work, it remains to experimentally verify the results obtained so far, as well as to further study the theoretical limitations posed by linearization (first-order perturbation theory) and by the assumption of the continuity of the metallic waveguide boundaries and their deformations.
