40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{degenerative}} disease of articular cartilage. The normal cartilage {{is known to}} be an excellent bearing material with remarkable lubricating properties and very low frictional co-efficient and wear and generally survives the lifetime of a person. The contact mechanics of the articular cartilage was investigated in this study. The contact mechanics of the cartilage surface against both rigid metallic and cartilage surfaces was investigated using finite element method. Axisymmetric and two-dimensional plane stain models were developed to examine consolidation and sliding respectively. A new contact detection algorithm was developed to be used with ABAQUS (ABAQUS., 2005) which was more generic in nature. Two versions were developed; one for the indenter-cartilage models and the other for the cartilage-cartilage models. The first algorithm and the corresponding model were validated against the previous study (Warner, 2000) for the indentation of the articular cartilage using a rigid spherical indenter. The second algorithm and the model were validated against the study by Federico and colleagues (Federico et al., 2004) for the cartilage-cartilage configuration. The results presented in these studies could be reproduced with high degree of accuracy. The first algorithm was also applied to derive the mechanical properties of the cartilage from the experimental indentation measurements as well as to study its behaviour. All the sliding models showed the interstitial fluid pressurization persisted over a long time period. This fluid load support of the cartilage had been shown to contribute towards lowering the frictional co-efficient (Forster et al., 1995; Krishnan et al., 2005). The model of a rigid plate sliding over the cartilage covering it entirely during the course of sliding showed similar results as consolidation. The fluid exudation suggested in the weeping lubrication (McCutchen, 1959; McCutchen, 1962) mechanism was also observed in this model. In the model of a rigid cylindrical indenter sliding over cartilage the fluid pressurization was found to decrease initially before attaining the steady value. The stress shielding phenomenon of the cartilage was also observed as in other models. The <b>self</b> generating <b>lubrication</b> (Mow and Lai, 1980) phenomena and boosted lubrication (Maroudas, 1967; Walker et al., 1968) were observed in this model...|$|R

Machine is automatic system for molding glycerine suppositories. These machines are typical of many types of drug production and packaging equipment whose metal parts are treated with space spinoff coatings that promote general machine efficiency and contribute to compliance with stringent federal sanitation codes for pharmaceutical manufacture. Collectively known as "synergistic" coatings, these dry lubricants are bonded to a variety of metals to form an extremely hard slippery surface with long lasting <b>self</b> <b>lubrication.</b> The coatings offer multiple advantages; they cannot chip, peel or be rubbed off.

40|$|Abstract. Friction {{and wear}} tests of Al 2 O 3 and SiC were {{conducted}} from room temperature to 1200 ºC both in air and in vacuum. Results {{show that the}} wear mechanism of Al 2 O 3 is dominated by micro fracture, debris abrasive and delamination at temperatures below 600 ºC, while is controlled by plastic deformation and recrystallization among 600 ~ 1200 ºC, resulting in an obvious decrease of wear loss. The wear rate and surface microstructure of SiC are closely depending on the testing temperature, atmosphere and contact pressure. Oxidation of SiC at elevated temperatures plays important role on the wear rate. <b>Self</b> <b>lubrication</b> of both Al 2 O 3 and SiC at high temperatures was observed, which is mainly depending on {{the formation of a}} specific surface layer composed of nano-particles or very thin glassy film...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of wear in two extreme cases {{relating to the}} performance of Si 3 N 4 -based cutting tools in machining iron alloys were investigated, with the corresponding wear rates correlated with cutting speed, tool and alloy composition and seizure. The sources of discrepancy between the cutting tests and conventional pin-on-disk tests are discussed on the basis of loads, surface speed, wear debris accumulation, reaction with atmospheric oxygen and solid lubrication. The distinct interactions with the ceramic tool of a hard, high temperature deformable alloy and a brittle, composite-like alloy with, in ddition, <b>self</b> <b>lubrication</b> at high temperature, yield great differences in the amount of heat generated during the process. The selective corrosion of the ceramic grain boundary phase and the abrasion through grain pullout and ploughing are changed according to the effects of temperature on the metal-ceramic contact surface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. NiCr/Cr 3 C 2 -WS 2 -CaF 2 mixed powders were {{prepared}} on 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti {{stainless steel substrate}} to fabricate high-temperature <b>self</b> <b>lubrication</b> wear resistant composite coating by laser cladding. The microstructure of the coating was examined by means of XRD, SEM and EDS. The high-temperature dry sliding friction and wear behavior of the composite coating were evaluated by using a ball-on-block wear tester at room temperature, 300 ℃ and 600 ℃, respectively. The {{results showed that the}} composite coating had a unique microstructure consisting of γ-(Ni,Fe) solid solution matrix, Cr 7 C 3 /WC reinforcement and CrS/WS 2 lubricant particles. The hardness of NiCr/Cr 3 C 2 -WS 2 -CaF 2 coating by laser cladding was lower than NiCr/Cr 3 C 2 coating, but higher than stainless steel substrate significantly. It was because of the addition of solid lubricant. In the wear process, elevated temperature was helpful to form a lubricating transfer film. As a result, the NiCr/Cr 3 C 2 -WS 2 -CaF 2 coating exhibited a notable anti-friction and wear resistance at 300 ℃ and 600 ℃...|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{electrolytic}} oxidation (PEO) processing for light metals {{is known for}} decades and has been established as a well-known industrial surface treatment offering a reasonable wear and corrosion protection. However, long-term protection is compromised by the intrinsic porosity and limited range of composition in the PEO layer. A novel approach is to introduce particles to the electrolyte, aiming at their in-situ incorporation into PEO coatings during growth. The idea is that {{with the help of}} particles the defects can be sealed, and the composition range and the functionalities of produced coatings can be enhanced. So far, multifunctional coatings with anticorrosion, <b>self</b> <b>lubrication,</b> anti-wear, bioactive and photocatalytic properties were produced with the aid of particle addition. The properties of particle itself, together with electrical and electrolyte parameters during PEO processing determine the way and efficiency of particle uptake and incorporation into the coatings. Normally incorporation of the particles into the coating can range from fully inert to fully reactive. This paper reviews recent progress on particle-containing PEO coatings formed on Mg, Al and Ti alloy substrates. The main focus is given to the uptake mechanism of particle into PEO layers and the introduced microstructural and functional changes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Systems with {{parts in}} {{relative}} motion experience friction and wear. The {{need to understand}} tribology on the micro- and nanoscale increases in importance with decreasing technological device sizes. Micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems often experience failure due to stiction (static friction). During {{millions of years of}} evolution, natural systems have optimized their tribological and other performances. The aim of biotribology is to gather information about friction, adhesion, lubrication and wear of biological friction systems and to apply this knowledge to innovate technology, with the additional benefit of environmental soundness. Examples for biological friction systems at different length scales are bacterial flagellae, joints and articular cartilage as well as muscle connective tissues. Our model system for biotribological investigations at the micro- and nanoscale are diatoms. Diatoms are single celled microalgae with a cell wall consisting of amorphous glass enveloped by an organic layer. Diatoms are small, highly reproductive, and accessible with different kinds of microscopy methods. There are several diatom species which actively move (e. g. Bacillaria paxillifer forms colonies of 5 to 30 cells which rhythmically expand and contract) or which can – as cell colonies – reversibly be elongated by a major fraction of their original length (e. g. Ellerbeckia arenaria). Diatoms also seem to show highly efficient <b>self</b> <b>lubrication</b> while cells divide and grow. These algae might provide lubrication strategies which are still unknown to engineers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGraphite (G) and its nano form Graphene (nG) {{are one of}} {{the most}} admirable fillers for {{incorporating}} multifunctional attributes in polymer/elastomer matrix. Use of such fillers in polymers/elastomers has enhanced their several properties and applicabilities. Acrylo Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) is a workhorse of the several industrial applications especially for automotive rubber products and in hydraulic area. Enhanced tribological properties of NBR {{are one of the}} crucial requirements for sealing applications. In this field we are first to report the anti wear study on NBR filled with Graphite and graphene layers. Sliding wear test showed that the wear parameters of NBR nanocomposites have significantly improved. The incorporation of graphene in NBR has reduced coefficient of friction 2. 3 times more than that of graphite incorporated NBR. The reason for the same is proposed that the homogeneous distribution of nano layers in the elastomer matrix, the enhanced <b>self</b> <b>lubrication</b> of graphene, the favourable interface stability of composite contributed together to the improved wear properties of NBR nanocomposites. Along with it we have also investigated the effect of applied load, revolution per minute i. e., sliding speed on wear properties. The incorporation of fillers (G &nG) in NBR has also improved the hardness and tensile properties other than tribological properties. Electrical conductivity of graphene filled NBR has also been reported in comparison to graphite filled NBR and pristine NBR. The prepared graphene and the nanocomposites have also been fully characterized by different sophisticated techniques viz HR-TEM, FEG-SEM, Micro Raman, FT-IR. Improvement in such properties of NBR will definitely widen its role in multiple applications...|$|E
