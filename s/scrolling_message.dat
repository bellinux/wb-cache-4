25|$|From 1999 to January 1, 2009, Saddle Brook had a public-access cable TV {{station with}} news bulletins (channel 77 on Cablevision and {{channels}} 38 and 39 on Verizon FiOS). This station, called SBC-TV, was created after Hurricane Floyd hit Saddle Brook in September 1999 so the town {{would have a}} system for emergency alerts. The station was shut down in 2009 because of budget constraints. The station resumed operations in 2011 with an all-volunteer staff, airing Township Council meetings and providing information of Township services, events and activities via a <b>scrolling</b> <b>message</b> board.|$|E

50|$|In October 2007 a new {{scoreboard}} {{was erected}} in right-center field, {{complete with a}} <b>scrolling</b> <b>message</b> board. Plans are in the making to add a video replay board in the future. An indoor practice hitting facility will be added adjacent to the third-base side of the stadium sometime in the near future.|$|E
5000|$|Partygoers often bring various {{senseless}} gadgets {{to parties}} {{to make their}} desk space look unique; this can be anything from a disco ball or a plasma lamp to a large LED display panel complete with a <b>scrolling</b> <b>message</b> about how [...] "elite" [...] its owner is. Many visitors also bring large loudspeakers for playing music. This kind of activity is particularly common among new partygoers, while the more experienced attendees tend to prefer a more quiet and relaxed atmosphere.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of the}} SAFER Act, WOWT {{kept its}} analog signal on the air {{temporarily}} to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a <b>scrolling</b> <b>message.</b> Voiceover artist Charlie Van Dyke provided narration: [...] "Sixty years ago, WOWT turned on its analog signal {{to be the first}} television station in Omaha. Now, join us for the digital age as we shut off our analog signal and transition to digital television. We look forward to the new journey ahead. This is WOWT, Channel 6." ...|$|E
50|$|A bootsplash can be {{a simple}} {{visualisation}} of the <b>scrolling</b> boot <b>messages</b> in the console, {{but it can also}} present graphics or some combinations of both.|$|R
50|$|The game {{features}} no {{user interface}} or heads-up display. Information is conveyed to the player through instructive screens {{that can be}} activated by the player character, or through <b>scrolling</b> <b>messages</b> in the background. Characters do not have hit points; instead, being attacked (such as being shot or mauled) generally causes instant death. However, the player has unlimited lives, and upon death will re-spawn at the last checkpoint they reached. Abe's Exoddus includes an option to quick save which allows the player to designate their own checkpoints, a feature which was not present in Abe's Oddysee due to programming conflicts and which attracted criticism of that title.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1948 and 1954, Bond Clothes {{operated}} a massive {{sign on the}} east side block of Broadway between 44th and 45th streets in New York's Times Square. The sign had nearly 2 miles of neon and included two 7-story-tall nude figures, a man and a woman, as bookends. Between the nude figures, there was a 27 ft and 132 ft waterfall with 50,000 gallons of recirculated water. Beneath the waterfall was a 278 ft zipper sign with <b>scrolling</b> <b>messages.</b> The Bond zipper was made up of more than 20,000 light bulbs. Above the waterfall was a digital clock with the wording [...] "Every Hour 3,490 People Buy at Bond." [...] Some of the sign remained in place to advertise the Bond Stores location until the stores closure in 1977.|$|R

50|$|West Digital Television (co-owned by WIN and Prime) {{was unable}} to reach an {{affiliation}} deal with Nine {{in time for the}} switchover, with the co-owners stating that Nine had been actively rejecting offers. On 1 July 2016, WDT halted its programming and began broadcasting a loop of scenic video with a <b>scrolling</b> <b>message</b> stating that programming was unavailable. On the evening of 2 July 2016, Nine reached an affiliation deal with WDT; at around 7:30 p.m. WST, WDT began broadcasting Nine Network programming by joining its federal election coverage already in progress.|$|E
5000|$|TCM 2 didn't have a {{power cut}} {{because of its}} {{downtime}} of timesharing. Most advertising was suspended {{and several of the}} channel websites were offline also. Those who could still receive the channels had a backup transmission played out, making people confused when Cartoon Network Too and Boomerang were showing episodes of The Flintstones at the same time. These backups where played out with a <b>scrolling</b> <b>message</b> which said [...] "We apologise for the disruption to this service. This is due to technical problems. We will resume normal programming as soon as possible" [...] in multiple languages.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{an awareness}} application called Tickertape. Tickertape {{is a tool}} that displays event notifications {{in the form of}} <b>scrolling</b> <b>messages</b> across a single-line window. The Tickertape message window provides an interface to a world of highly tailorable transient information. We provide an overview of Tickertape features and then discuss its specific use within a semi-commercial research organisation. We note that although Tickertape's evolution was incidental rather than purposeful, it is being extensively used within our organisation. Usage data and interviews suggest that there is a select core group of users who use Tickertape for both work and leisure. Other more casual users use the tool sporadically for leisure purposes only. We highlight our current goal which is to optimise Tickertape usage within the work environment. We hope to achieve this by enhancing the Tickertape user interface and encouraging its widespread use within the organisation. Our long-term vision [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|DOCS [...] {{replaced}} or supplanted {{the typewriter}} interface {{with a video}} screen. In practice, it worked a little like present-day instant messenger programs (ICQ, QQ, AIM, Adium, iChat, etc.), with a data entry line {{at the bottom and}} <b>messages</b> <b>scrolling</b> in real time up the screen. The commands were otherwise identical.|$|R

5000|$|On 1 July 2016, WIN's Nine Network-affiliated {{stations}} {{switched to}} Network Ten, displacing WDT's affiliation and requiring {{the station to}} negotiate a switch to Nine Network. WDT failed to reach an affiliation deal with Nine {{in time for the}} switchover, with the co-owners stating that Nine had been actively rejecting offers. At this time, the channel temporarily suspended transmission, with programming replaced by a loop of scenic footage with the <b>scrolling</b> <b>message</b> [...] "Programming on this channel in Regional Western Australia is currently unavailable." [...] On the evening of 2 July 2016 at around 7:30 p.m. WST, WDT began to carry Nine programming, joining its federal election coverage already in progress.|$|E
5000|$|On January 31, 2012, {{the station}} began testing its new {{transmitter}} in Southfield, keeping its UHF 31 transmitter in Chelsea operational {{as a temporary}} fill-in transmitter. The channel 50 transmitter abruptly ended transmissions less than two days later, leaving only its channel 31 digital signal and its analog translator W48AV. On May 23, 2012, the station again turned on its transmitter on UHF channel 50, but ceased transmission the following day. On July 24, 2012, WPXD began permanent digital transmitter operations in Southfield, broadcasting on UHF channel 50. The transmitter in Chelsea remained active until noon on August 20, 2012, though starting {{on the morning of}} August 6, 2012, the Chelsea transmitter replaced normal programming with SMPTE color bars and a <b>scrolling</b> <b>message</b> regarding this [...] "technical change", noting for viewers to re-scan their converter boxes and sets and aim their antennas towards Southfield. The former Lyndon Township site has since been repurposed as a transmitter site for MyNetworkTV affiliate WHTV in Lansing.|$|E

5000|$|The RDS/RBDS {{subcarrier}} (57 kHz) allows FM radios {{to display}} what station they are on, pick another frequency {{on the same}} network or with the same format, <b>scroll</b> brief <b>messages</b> like station slogans, news, weather, or traffic—even activate pagers or remote billboards. It can also broadcast EAS messages, and has a station [...] "format" [...] name ALERT to automatically trigger radios to tune in for emergency info, even if a CD is playing. While it never really caught on in North America, European stations frequently rely on this system. An upgraded version is built into digital radio.|$|R
50|$|The rest of {{the console}} {{is used as a}} {{scrolling}} display of events. When a message is issued that requires an operator response, it is given a number from 0 to 9 and remains on the display until it is answered. Tape mount <b>messages</b> do <b>scroll</b> with other <b>messages</b> but will be repeated every two minutes until the tape is mounted.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with the}} blink element, marquee-tagged images or text {{are not always}} {{completely}} visible on rendered pages, making printing such pages an inefficient (if not impossible) task; typically multiple attempts are required to capture all text that could be displayed where <b>messages</b> <b>scroll</b> or blink. The [...] version of marquee makes text jitter back and forth but does not obscure {{any part of it}} if scrolling widths are set correctly.|$|R
40|$|Tree of Fortune was a {{major public}} artwork {{comprising}} of 130 LED scrolling text boxes distributed throughout a large tree. Each module displayed an individual <b>scrolling</b> <b>message</b> presented in red LED text, created in collaboration with Brisbane writer Linda Carolli. The work was commissioned for and presented in a prominent riverbank location at Christchurch’s 2004 Biennial. It {{was accompanied by a}} high quality catalogue publication. [...] - The project sought to foster private reflection amongst its viewers around the context of contemporary ecological crises, whilst also calling upon the power of their imagining as a method for retaining positive and critical mindsets in the face of adversity. This was achieved through ostensibly presenting texts in the form of ‘fortune cookie’ style statements, but then configuring them to require a personal response. This sense of unraveling questions and answers was further cemented through the qualities of each scrolling text, which only revealed a small part of each phrase at any one time. ...|$|E
5000|$|Since 1997, Colombian {{television}} networks {{are required to}} specify programs within dubbed family and adult fringes, and must display a notice signifying the audience, both visually and in narration, the minimum age required to watch the program, if it contains sexual or violent content, and if parental company is needed {{at the beginning of}} every program. The networks must also air an 'institutional message' daily at 21:00, inviting children 12 years of age or less to [...] "not to stay exposed to contents which have no essentially child-oriented nature." [...] A message must be broadcast at 22:10, Monday through Friday, (22:30 Saturdays and Sundays) explaining to viewers that the adult fringe has started. Most networks opt to display a <b>scrolling</b> text <b>message</b> instead.|$|R
5000|$|Super Pinball: Behind the Mask {{features}} three tables: the clown-themed [...] "Jolly Joker", {{the pirate}} themed [...] "Blackbeard and Ironmen", and the fantasy-themed [...] "Wizard." [...] All tables {{are shown in}} a tilted 3D view, which fits the entire table on the screen {{without the need for}} <b>scrolling,</b> with marquee <b>messages</b> and bonuses displayed as giant overlays on the screen. The game can be played from one to four players. The game uses 3D graphics.|$|R
40|$|Unbearable Lightness was {{a public}} artwork of 110 LED {{scrolling}} text boxes distributed throughout the canopy of a large, mature tree, located in a high traffic location in a major Brisbane Parkland. The work was a major commission for the Southbank Corporation Public Art Program and was exhibited during the three months around Christmas and New Year 2003. Each text module displayed individual LED <b>scrolling</b> <b>messages</b> developed during collaboration with locally based hypertext writer, Linda Carolli. Set {{during the time of}} the highly contentious Invasion of Iraq, the texts posed open questions around the themes of lightness, thinness and emptiness with the aim of promoting contentions of hope in a time of painful impotence for concerned citizens. [...] - The text modules were positioned in sympathy with the position of major constellations in the night sky at that time whilst the design alluded to Martin Luther’s original Christmas tree envisaged as a mixture of ‘stars’ seen via a tree. The tree was further outlined and highlighted with blue spotlights set within its crown. The project required the design, networking and ruggedisation of the work’s waterproof electronic modules – assisted by an electronic designer. These modules were later re-purposed into a range of other works and formats. [...] - Set within the context of major antiwar protests of that era, the project sought to foster private reflection amongst its viewers whilst also calling upon the power of their personal and collective imagining as a method for retaining positive and critical mindsets in the face of such painful social and political adversities. The work became a strong focus of attention within the park and generated nightly debate and enthusiastic spoken reading sessions. ...|$|R
5000|$|As Bree {{tries to}} get her bearings, Lynette arrives asking her to babysit the twins and Penny. Bree hesitantly accepts and soon begins {{drinking}} again when the twins become out of control. She falls asleep which causes the twins to pack up Penny and go searching for their parents' office. When she wakes up, Bree begins looking frantically for the children but they have already left. Lynette then receives {{a phone call from}} a beauty shop owner claiming she has their children there. Lynette and Tom rush over where the beauty shop owner scolds them for abandoning their children with a bad babysitter. Lynette thanks the woman for finding her kids and leaves. When they arrive home, Lynette asks Bree what happened and Bree lies saying the children left without her knowing. The twins say she is lying which causes Lynette to punish them. Later, Mrs. McCluskey tells Lynette she saw Bree drunk and that if she was the babysitter she would never be drunk while watching someone else's children. Lynette refuses to believe this but goes to talk to Bree about it, just in case. Bree tries to brush off the accusations, once again denying that she was drunk. However, Lynette hears a clinking sound when Bree puts down her garbage bags. Lynette asks Bree if she has a drinking problem, which Bree denies. After Bree leaves, Lynette opens Bree's garbage bags, looking for bottles of alcohol. When Bree comes out, she finds a neatly stacked line of 12 wine bottles on her porch. A <b>scrolled</b> <b>message</b> lies on top of one of the bottles, reading: [...] "Do you still think you don't have a problem?" [...] Bree and Lynette stare at each other, neither one of them saying a word.|$|R
25|$|The WeatherStar systems also utilize a Lower Display Line (LDL) {{that appears}} {{at the bottom of}} the screen during all {{programming}} (until November 2013, it had been limited to only local forecasts and national programming, while being removed from the screen during commercial breaks), providing current conditions for a specific location and two or three towns within 15 miles, almanac data and forecasts on cable headends using the IntelliStar system, and only current conditions and forecasts on cable headends using STAR models from WeatherStar XL and older. WeatherStar units also allow cable providers to <b>scroll</b> text <b>messages</b> when in use, including the capability to broadcast severe weather advisories and warnings in effect for the jurisdiction in which the WeatherStar system's cable headend is located and its immediate surrounding area.|$|R

5000|$|The {{agreement}} between Charter and Sinclair had expired prior to Suddenlink's acquisition both parties began negotiations in May 2006 before the acquisition was completed. Sinclair announced on June 30, 2006 {{it was not}} able to reach an agreement with Suddenlink. Sinclair argued that Suddenlink's proposals included no compensation and no response to their counteroffer. Without a retransmission consent agreement Suddenlink {{would not be allowed to}} carry the two stations on any of its cable systems. During the dispute Sinclair posted a letter on the websites of the two stations and began to notify viewers with <b>scrolling</b> crawl <b>messages</b> on the bottom of the screen encouraging them to switch to another provider like DirecTV or Dish Network. While this was a comparable solution for the Huntington-Charleston area the two satellite providers didn't provide the two stations to viewers in Beckley or Parkersburg.|$|R
5000|$|... is little-used. IBM {{documentation}} {{described it}} as [...] "inactive", and the key's purpose was a mystery even to keyboard manufacturers. In modern software, typing text usually causes previous text to scroll {{off the top of}} the screen or window. Some old programs could disable this and restart at the top of the window when scroll lock was pressed. The advantage is that the entire screenful of text does not shift, making it easier to read. Scroll Lock was also used to lock the cursor on its line and scroll the work area under it. In spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel, it locks the cell pointer on the current cell, allowing the user to use the arrow keys to move the view window without moving the cell pointer. On some consoles (such as the Linux console), it prevents <b>scrolling</b> of <b>messages</b> until another key combination is pressed. Many hardware KVM switches use Scroll Lock to switch between the devices they control.|$|R

The message window size, presence of <b>scrolling,</b> a single <b>message</b> window vs. message windows for each participant, and message persistence were systematically varied for pairs of interlocutors engaged in the same decision-making task. Participants produced more total words and more turns in conditions with larger windows and in those with scrolling, while separate windows conditioned even larger increases on these measures. Turn sizes were smaller in the latter conditions and response times were faster. In the persistent separate-window conditions, messages from the partner intervened before participants completed responses in over half of the messages...|$|R
