5000|$|Adapting {{the design}} {{to fire the}} {{standard}} [...]303 British round led to the Rifle, [...]303 Pattern 1914 (P14), a design fed from a five-round internal box magazine. With its prominent <b>sight</b> <b>protection</b> ears on the receiver, [...] "dog-leg" [...] bolt handle and [...] "pot-belly" [...] magazine, it was distinctive in appearance. The action was essentially a Mauser design with some Lee-Enfield features and optimised for rapid fire, with the action cocking on closing, a feature highly valued by the British Army {{with its emphasis on}} riflemen highly trained for rapid fire, but less valued in other armies, such as the US or Germany, where cock-on-opening designs such as the M1903 Springfield and Gewehr 98 were preferred. Cock-on-opening actions became more difficult to operate when heated by rapid fire as the effort to open the bolt had to overcome the striker spring to cock the action as well as unsticking the fired case from the chamber. The P14 was an advanced design for the time, and was said to be the most advanced service rifle of World War I.|$|E
5000|$|In 1918, {{after the}} end of World War I and {{termination}} of contracts for both the P14 and M1917, Remington was left with two factories (the main factory at Ilion and a subsidiary at Eddystone) tooled up to make the M1917, and was also left with a large inventory of stored spare parts. [...] It was decided to make a sporting version of the P14-M1917 model rifles at the Ilion plant. In 1921, Remington introduced the Model 30 High Power sporting rifle in caliber 30-06 Springfield. Early models differed from the military rifles by deleting the prominent rear <b>sight</b> <b>protection</b> ears and machining the receiver bridge to the same diameter as the receiver ring, and straightening the floorplate. These changes made for a better-looking rifle but magazine capacity was reduced from 6 to 5 rounds. The barrel was of the military profile but shortened slightly to 24". The barreled action was placed into a sporter type stock of plain American black walnut with a schnabel fore-end and a steel buttplate grooved to prevent slipping. A simple receiver aperture sight was fitted to the receiver bridge by a dovetail. This sight was soon discontinued and replaced with one mounted further forward on the barrel band. The Mauser-type cock-on-closing feature, and the double-stage military-type trigger were retained. In 1926, the stock was refined with a higher and thicker comb. A crossbolt was added, and checkering of the pistol grip and fore-end became standard. There was a deluxe Model 30S made 1930-32 with a better designed and chequered stock, a Lyman 48 receiver type sight called Model 30 Express.|$|E
50|$|The Škorpion is {{equipped}} with open-type iron sights (mechanically adjustable forward post and flip rear sight with 75 and 150 m range notches) and a folding metal wire shoulder stock, which folds {{up and over the}} receiver and is locked on the front <b>sight’s</b> <b>protection</b> capture.|$|R

5000|$|The Type 30 carbineor cavalry rifle (...) is a {{modified}} version made 300 mm (11.8 in) shorter than the infantry model (the carbine's barrel measures 480 mm (18.9 in) against 790 mm (31.1 in) for the standard infantry issue). Intended to equip cavalry troops with a modern carbine. Differences other than the shorter barrel and stock from the standard infantry rifle is that it lacked a handguard over the barrel, rear sight ladder only went up to 1,500 meters (compared to the rifles 2,000 meters), front <b>sight</b> had <b>protection</b> guards on each side, slight changes to the bolt stop latch and the sling swivels were moved {{to the left side}} of the gun to prevent the bolt from digging into the cavalry trooper's back. The pre-production version lacked a bayonet.|$|R
50|$|In May 2016, Raytheon {{revealed}} {{they had}} engineered a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the M60A3 as a cost-effective upgrade to procuring more modern tanks. Changes include increased engine power from 750 hp to 950 hp, new electric turret controls that are faster, more responsive, and quieter {{than the previous}} hydraulic controls, adding the larger L44 120 mm gun along with digital fire-control and targeting systems with thermal <b>sights,</b> and <b>protection</b> enhancements of side skirts, slat armor, and likely reactive armor. The M60A3 SLEP puts the vehicle's performance on par with tanks such as the T-72 and M1A1 Abrams, while keeping training and maintenance costs down as crews are already familiar with the basic M60. The vehicle has undergone testing at the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground. Changing out the hydraulics with electronic systems decreases weight by one ton and the digital FCS allows for firing on the move.|$|R
25|$|T-72B3M: this is {{the newest}} variant of the T-72 fielded by the Russian army since 2016. Ammunition {{includes}} advanced projectiles. A large amount of reactive armor (analog to T-90MS). New radio communication. New panoramic <b>sight.</b> Increased <b>protection</b> against mines. A new fire control system. The most notable upgrade is the stabilized, panoramic, independent commander's PK PAN sight with integrated thermal viewer, thought to have similar specifications to the Sosna-U. The automotive performance of the tank was also improved with a more powerful V-92S2 engine rated at 1,130hp (830kW) coupled to an automatic transmission system and improved drivetrain. Relikt new generation ERA was installed. The Russian Defense Ministry has purchased several hundred T-72B3M tanks and received the first 20 in early 2017. 20 more in March 2017. Another 20 in May 2017. 15 more in June 2017. Total ordered 154 tanks. In June 2017, it was entered service with the Belarussian army. Next delivery in September 2017. The last delivery took place in November 2017.|$|R

5000|$|A {{number of}} Bundesländer tried {{to ban the}} VVN during the 1950s. A {{judicial}} ruling forced Lower Saxony to lift its ban and in Hamburg, [...] "VAN" [...] was left as a [...] "replacement" [...] organization, but in Rhineland-Palatinate, the ban remained in effect. At {{the end of the}} 1950s, the federal government went to federal court to establish a ban against the VVN at the national level. The opening of the trial erupted into political scandal when it was revealed that the presiding judge, Senate President Prof. Dr. Werner had been an aggressive Nazi, resulting in the discontinuation of the case. The anti-communist climate continued to plague members of the VVN during the postwar era, though in <b>sight</b> of constitutional <b>protection</b> and during the 1970s, they were at times criticized by radicals.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Priority or hazard indices are used by the states to rank their rail-highway intersections according to relative hazard to aid in locating crossings for treatment of conditions and/or improvements in warning devices. The Texas Priority Index has been effective over the years in identifying particularly hazardous rail-highway intersections based on high vehicle volumes, train volumes, and accident histories, and these crossings have been treated or improved. Many of the remaining crossings, however, are not well discriminated in terms of their need for improvement; many crossings have the same index number. The objective of this research was to evaluate sight distance as a criterion for prioritizing rail-highway intersections in Texas to help distinguish between the crossings with similar or identical priority index numbers. Accident and sight distance data were compiled and analyzed. A sight distance variable was incorporated into the current Texas Priority Index and evaluated for its effects on the overall ranking of the rail-highway intersections. A state hazard index was chosen from a state-of-the-practice review with which to compare the current and revised Texas Priority Indices. Finally, the effectiveness of each of the indices was predicted in terms of the distribution of priority index numbers and their ability to move the most potentially hazardous crossings up in the rankings. It was concluded from the accident analysis that sight distance contributed to more vehicle-train accidents than any other factor. Further, improvements to warning devices at passive crossings would effectively reduce the overall sight obstruction, reduce the number of train involved accidents, and thus, reduce the number of injuries and fatalities resulting from accidents at rail-highway intersections. It was concluded from the field data analysis that the Method 1 revised Texas Priority Index was the most effective index of the four priority indices evaluated in this thesis for ranking crossings in terms of exposure, accident history, <b>sight</b> distance, and <b>protection</b> type. The Method 1 revised index was effective at redistributing the individual index numbers in the rank and identifying crossings with restricted sight distance while conserving the significance of the exposure values...|$|R
