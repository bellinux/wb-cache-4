50|$|A {{descriptor}} is {{in chemical}} nomenclature a prefix placed before the systematic <b>substance</b> <b>name,</b> which describes the configuration or the stereochemistry of the molecule. Some listed descriptors are only of historical interest {{and should not}} be used in publications anymore as they do not correspond with the modern recommendations of the IUPAC. Stereodescriptors are often used in combination with locants to clearly identify a chemical structure unambiguously.|$|E

30|$|The REACH {{database}} includes {{information on}} the EC number, the CAS number and the <b>substance</b> <b>name</b> as well as {{information on the}} registration status, i.e. if the substance is registered as a full dossier (3, 537 substances out of 5, 306) or as an isolated intermediate (on-site isolated or transported isolated intermediate; 2, 510 substances are respective intermediates, thereof 744 compounds are registered as a full dossier). In contrast to the CDSL, which contains all substances in use on the Canadian market, the REACH database does not include information on the chemical's type (organic, inorganic, etc.) and toxicity (toxic or not toxic). Therefore, we first check which of the compounds in the REACH database are already contained in the CDSL such that more information on the respective compounds is already available.|$|E

40|$|Systems that extract {{biological}} {{regulatory pathway}} relations from free-text sources {{are intended to}} help researchers leverage vast and growing collections of research literature. Several systems to extract such relations have been developed but little work has focused on how those relations can be usefully organized (aggregated) to support visualization systems or analysis algorithms. Ontological resources that enumerate name strings for different types of biomedical objects should {{play a key role}} in the organization process. In this paper we delineate five potentially useful levels of relational granularity and propose the use of aggregatable substance identifiers to help reduce lexical ambiguity. An aggregatable substance identifier applies to a gene and its products. We merged 4 extensive lexicons and compared the extracted strings to the text of five million MEDLINE abstracts. We report on the ambiguity within and between name strings and common English words. Our results show an 89 % reduction in ambiguity for the extracted human <b>substance</b> <b>name</b> strings when using an aggregatable substance approach. ...|$|E
30|$|After having {{identified}} all organic non-ionic {{compounds in}} the REACH database, these substances are {{run through the}} batch mode of the software package EPISuite v 4.10 to quantify physical-chemical substance properties by the implemented estimation methods. The program input for EPISuite {{is a list of}} SMILES codes of the organic non-ionic substances deduced from the CAS numbers, which are given in the REACH database. The parameters obtained from the estimation with EPISuite and needed for the further screening methods are the CAS number and <b>substance</b> <b>name</b> for identification; molecular mass (g mol- 1); logarithmic octanol-water partition coefficient log KOW; air-water partition coefficient KAW; degradation half-lives (t 1 / 2) in air, water, sediment and soil (in days); and BCF according to the Arnot-Gobas method [24]. For some of the compounds, the database of EPISuite also contains experimental values determined for chemical properties. However, for comparability and reproducibility reasons, we only consider calculated values in this early screening step. A refined investigation of substance properties is included in a last step to analyse the reliability of the screening method.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{information}} that is available when marketing authorizations are approved is limited. Pharmacovigilance has an important role during the postauthorization period, and alerts published by national authorities allow health care professionals to be informed about new data on safety profiles. This study therefore sought to analyze all safety alerts published by the Portuguese National Authority of Medicines and Health Products I. P. (INFARMED). METHODS: We conducted an observational study of all alerts published on the INFARMED website from January 2002 through December 2014. From the data included in the alerts, the following information was abstracted: active <b>substance</b> <b>name</b> (and trade name), event {{that led to the}} alert, and the resulting safety measures. Active substances were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code. FINDINGS: A total of 562 alerts were published, and 304 were eligible for inclusion. The musculoskeletal system was the ATC code with more alerts (n = 53), followed by the nervous system (n = 42). Communication of the information and recommendations to the health care professionals and the public in general was the most frequent safety measure (n = 128), followed by changes in the Summary of the Product Characteristics and package information leaflet (n = 66). During the study period, 26 marketing authorizations were temporarily suspended and 10 were revoked. IMPLICATIONS: The knowledge of the alerts published during the postmarketing period is very useful to the health care professionals for improving prescription and use of medicines and to the scientific community for the development of new researches.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundA free webPOISONCONTROL app {{allows the}} public to {{determine}} the appropriate triage of poison ingestions without calling poison control. If accepted and safe, this alternative expands access to reliable poison control services to those who prefer the Internet over the telephone. This study assesses feasibility, safety, and user-acceptance of automated online triage of asymptomatic, nonsuicidal poison ingestion cases. MethodsThe user provides <b>substance</b> <b>name,</b> amount, age, and weight in an automated online tool or downloadable app, and is given a specific triage recommendation to stay home, go to the emergency department, or call poison control for further guidance. Safety was determined by assessing outcomes of consecutive home-triaged cases with follow-up and by confirming the correct application of algorithms. Case completion times and user perceptions of speed {{and ease of use}} were measures of user-acceptance. ResultsOf 9256 cases, 73. 3 % were triaged to home, 2. 1 % to an emergency department, and 24. 5 % directed to call poison control. Children younger than 6 years were involved in 75. 2 % of cases. Automated follow-up was done in 31. 2 % of home-triaged cases; 82. 3 % of these had no effect. No major or fatal outcomes were reported. More than 91 % of survey respondents found the tool quick and easy to use. Median case completion time was 4. 1 minutes. ConclusionwebPOISONCONTROL augments traditional poison control services by providing automated, accurate online access to case-specific triage and first aid guidance for poison ingestions. It is safe, quick, and easy to use...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare the use of antibiotics at the Metropolitan Medical Center Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia (MMCH), before and after the implementation of a hospital formulary. All antibiotic data under J 01 Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification were collected from pharmacy inpatient and outpatient records. Quantitative antibiotic use was expressed in Defined Daily Doses/ 100 bed-days (DDDs/hbd) for inpatients and DDDs/ 1000 patients/day (DDDs/tpd) for outpatients. The general quality of drug use was assessed in number of drugs that account for 90 % of the use (DU 90 %) and the adherence to hospital formulary by substance and brand name within the DU 90 % segment. Quantitative and qualitative antibiotic use were compared before and after implementation of the formulary (1999 to 2000). The Wilcoxon rank sign test was used to compare overall antibiotic use. Inpatient antibiotic usage decreased significantly by 23. 1 %, 124. 96 DDDs/hbd in 1999 to 96. 13 DDDs/hbd during 2000 (p= 0. 03) and outpatient antibiotic usage decreased insignificantly by 4. 9 %, 3. 49 DDDs/tpd during 1999 to 3. 32 DDDs/tpd during 2000 (p= 0. 58). The most commonly antibiotic use was ciprofloxacin in inpatient setting during the study and in out-patient setting was amoxicillin in 1999 and ciprofloxacin in 2000. The adherence to the formulary by substance and by brand name in inpatient department was 100 % and 90. 5 % and in outpatient department was 100 % and 94. 3 % during the study. DU 90 % by <b>substance</b> <b>name</b> and by brand name was considerably not improved in both settings. The conclusion is that the effectiveness of one year formulary implementation at MMCH was only revealed in inpatient setting.
