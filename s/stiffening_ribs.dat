40|$|Abstract. Stress {{analysis}} {{is an essential}} part of the design process and is also an indispensable tool for optimizing structural design to meet multidisciplinary performance requirements. The purpose of this study is to determine natural vibration frequency of intake manifold on the natural gas motorcycle by using finite element modal analysis. Besides that, the stress and displacements of the manifold structure are also been determined. When the motorcycle engine is running, the engine will cause some vibration due to unbalance condition of the engine. Vibration created by the engine will be transmitted to all neighboring component including intake manifold as well as the air fuel mixer. Intake manifold is next to the engine which is the source of the vibration. Thus, it takes greater impact of the transmitted vibration as compare to other components. Computer simulation technique using Finite Element method has been used to simulate this problem. Finite Element structure analysis was employed to study the stress distribution and natural frequency of the intake manifold. Finite Element model of the intake manifold is developed and analyzed. The effect of localize <b>stiffening</b> with <b>ribs</b> on intake manifold is considered to reduce the level of the vibration. It was found that by adding a <b>stiffened</b> <b>rib</b> to the manifold structure, the natural frequencies are increased.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model is presented for structure-borne sound transmission at a bolted junction in a rib-stiffened plate structure. The model {{is based on}} the wave approach for junctions of semiinfinite plates and calculates coupling loss factors required by Statistical Energy Analysis. The <b>stiffening</b> <b>rib</b> is modelled as a plate strip and the junction is represented by an elastic interlayer with a spatially dependent stiffness. Experimental verification is carried out on a series of Plexiglas plate structures with varying rib depth and bolt spacing. A well-defined connection length at the junction was created by inserting thin spacers between the plate and the rib at each bolt. Comparison between numerical and experimental data for this case showed good agreement. Measured results for the bolted junction without spacers, suggested that structureborne sound transmission could be modelled as a series of connections characterized by an equivalent connection length. This concept is explored further by determining an optimum connection length which gives the best agreement between numerical and experimental data. PACS numbers: 43. 40. Dx, 43. 40. At, 43. 55.

It is found that the electromagnetic body force loads simultaneously in the ribs and the webs, and the deformation of the panels is mainly driven by the force in the ribs. The distribution of force in the grid-rib panel can be found as the superposition of the two uni-directional stiffened panels. The velocity distribution for the grid-rib panel is primarily affected by the X-directional ribs, then the Y-directional ribs, and the variation of the velocity {{are influenced by the}} force distribution primarily and secondly the inertial effect. Mutual influence of deformation exists between the region undergoing deformation and the deformed or underformed free ends.
