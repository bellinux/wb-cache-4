The SK material is an uranium (U) -molybdenum (Mo) alloy material of 90 % U/ 10 % Mo by weight with 20 % 235 U enrichment.

The second set of solvent extraction tests determined whether the 2. 5 wt % sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3) <b>solvent</b> <b>wash</b> change frequency would need to be modified for the processing of the SK material. The batch distribution coefficient measurements were performed using dissolved SK material diluted to 20 g/L (U + Mo) in 4 M HNO{sub 3 } and 5 M HNO{sub 3 }. In these experiments, U had a distribution coefficient greater than 2. 5 while at least 99 % of the nickel (Ni) and greater than 99. 9 % of the Mo remained in the aqueous phase.

It is likely that the decomposition and agglomeration of Ag+ to Ag 0 may occur during the thermal regeneration step, only {{in the presence of the}} polar organic compounds remaining on the AgXO@SBA- 15 after <b>solvent</b> <b>washing,</b> as silver/silver oxide attracts N-containing organic solvents easily, i.e., ammonia solutions or cupric ammine (Starovoytov et al. 2007; Guan 1994; Yoon et al. 2003), which further accelerates the reductive decomposition of silver species, and the Ag 0 is more likely to accumulate on the silica surface. For comparison, instead of organic solvents, the desulfurization capacity of the spent adsorbent regenerated by deionized water wash followed with oxidative air treatment was tested and the desulfurization capacity was only 0.83  mg-S/g, lower than that from acetonitrile. This is likely due to the fact that water can hardly remove the residues adsorbed on the spent AgXO@SBA- 15.

Work at SRL showed that the interfacial tension of the contaminated solvent, as sampled, was 2. 5, indicating that substances, possibly long chain acids, were present that could affect disengaging times for the solvent. Virgin 30 % TBP in n-paraffin has a interfacial tension of around 10 or better, for example. Tests conducted by Reif also showed that the contaminated solvent picked up significantly more fission products, Ru{sup 106 } and Zr{sup 95 }, than did virgin solvent. The contaminated solvent, following contact with alumina, had a greatly improved interfacial tension of 9. 5 and exhibited much less pickup of both Ru{sup 106 } and Zr{sup 95 }. In a H-Area process testing, contact of process solvent with alumina produced improved interfacial tension values and reduced Zr{sup 95 } pickup by the 7. 5 % TBP used there.

In this study, solid phase extraction using the imprinted polymer has been optimized with the experimental design approach for a triazine herbicide, named atrazine with regard to the critical factors which influence the molecular imprinted solid phase extraction efficiency such as sample pH, concentration, flow-rate, volume, elution <b>solvent,</b> <b>washing</b> <b>solvent</b> and sorbent mass. Optimization methods that involve changing one factor at a time can be laborious. A novel approach for the optimization of imprinted solid-phase extraction using chemometrics is described. The factors were evaluated statistically and also validated with spiked water samples and showed a good reproducibility over six consecutive days as well as six within-day experiments. Also, in order to the evaluate efficiency of the optimized molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction protocols, enrichment capacity, reusability and cross-reactivity of cartridges have been also evaluated. Finally, selective molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction of atrazine was successfully demonstrated with a recovery above 90 % for spiked drinking water samples. It was concluded that the chemometrics is frequently employed for analytical method optimization and based on the obtained results, it is believed that the central composite design could prove beneficial for aiding the molecularly imprinted polymer and molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction development...|$|R
