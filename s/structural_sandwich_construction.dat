The tests, to evaluate the in-plane compressive behavior of the sandwich panels made of both core materials, were carried out in accordance with ASTM C 364 on specimens with nominal dimensions of 250  ×  250  ×  65  mm 3. The loaded surfaces (250  ×  65  mm 2) were levelled to avoid any non-uniform or transverse loading. The load was applied with the same testing machine used in the tests described above.

40|$|Interest is {{expanding}} {{in the use}} of <b>sandwich</b> <b>constructions</b> for <b>structural</b> applications. <b>Sandwich</b> <b>constructions,</b> consisting of two thin, stiff faces separated by a thick lightweight core, are generally known for their great efficiency in providing stiffness at low weight. Core materials are traditionally cellular solids [...] honeycombs or foams. With the recent development of processes to manufacture foams from molten metals, metallic foams have been proposed as a candidate for sandwich cores. Metallic foams are attractive candidate core materials due to the ease with which they may be formed into complex shapes, as well as their qualities of impact resistance, acoustical damping, thermal insulation, and fire resistance. In this study, the failure behavior of metallic foam core sandwich beams is examined. Several different modes of failure are analyzed: face yielding, face wrinkling, core yielding, and indentation. For the latter two modes, a multiaxial stress state in the core must be considered. Consequently, a yield surface for metallic foams is necessary. Three yield criteria have been proposed. The first is derived from an analysis of the failure o...|$|R
