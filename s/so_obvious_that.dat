He is co-author, along with Mary Bennett, of Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers and co-producer of What Happened On the Moon? He is the main proponent of the 'whistle-blower' accusation, arguing that mistakes in the NASA photos are <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> they are evidence that insiders are trying to 'blow the whistle' on the hoax by knowingly adding mistakes that they know will be seen. Most of his allegations of photographic anomalies have been refuted by Doug Millard of the Science Museum in London.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{originally}} planned a voice-over {{to reveal that}} the satellites seen after the prologue are nuclear weapons, and that the Star Child would detonate the weapons {{at the end of}} the film. However, he decided this would create associations with his previous film Dr. Strangelove, and decided not to make it <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> they were [...] "war machines". A few weeks before the release of the film, the U.S. and Soviet governments had agreed not to put any nuclear weapons into outer space.|$|E
500|$|Bridge {{topology}} is {{an important}} topology with many uses in both linear and non-linear applications, including, amongst many others, the bridge rectifier, the Wheatstone bridge and the lattice phase equaliser. [...] There are several ways that bridge topology is rendered in circuit diagrams. [...] The first rendering in figure 1.8 is the traditional depiction of a bridge circuit. [...] The second rendering clearly shows the equivalence between the bridge topology and a topology derived by series and parallel combinations. [...] The third rendering is more commonly known as lattice topology. [...] It is not <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> this is topologically equivalent. [...] It {{can be seen that}} this is indeed so by visualising the top left node moved {{to the right of the}} top right node.|$|E

500|$|Jarrold's {{adaptation}} {{also came}} {{in the wake of}} a number of literary biographical films, such as Shakespeare in Love and Miss Potter. Deborah Cartmell, author of Screen Adaptations: Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice: A Close Study of the Relationship between Text and Film, found similarities between Becoming Jane and Shakespeare in Love [...] "almost <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> the [...] film risks the accusation of being dangerously derivative." [...] A given example included the characters of Austen and William Shakespeare inputting their personal experiences directly into their works. Marina Cano López and Rosa María García-Periago explained that the film [...] "follows the path opened by John Madden’s Shakespeare in Love. The numerous intertextual connections between both movies can be reduced to one: [...] just as Shakespeare is imagined as the hero of his own play, Jane Austen becomes the heroine of her own novel." [...] Among other listed similarities, they noted that the romantic interests of both protagonists serve as their literary muses, and that the middle part of both films [...] "lie" [...] when viewed from a historical perspective.|$|E
500|$|Ann Hodgman of Entertainment Weekly was {{negative}} in her review and dismissed the episode for feeling [...] "like a plateful of warmed-up leftovers." [...] Hodgman criticized the writers' decision to devoting {{too much of}} the episode to the Mary Alice storyline rather than focusing on the other characters. She wrote that Rex's death did not come as a surprise, noting: [...] "Just as a TV or movie cop is inevitably shot after he announces that he's about to retire, we know it's over for Rex the minute Bree rests her head on his feeble chest and promises him he'll make it." [...] Hodgman stated that her interest in the Gabrielle and Carlos storyline was ruined by John telling Carlos about the affair rather than Carlos discovering it himself. She also declared that the Lynette storyline was [...] "wrapped up almost as perfunctorily, or maybe it only seems that way because it's long been <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> they were heading toward one of those folktales where the husband and wife switch places." [...] Hodgman concluded by saying the fates of Susan and Mike are predictable, as the characters are too important to be killed off. In 2009, TV Guide ranked the episode #55 on its list of [...] "100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time". The Futon Critic ranked the episode as the 19th best television episode of 2005, calling it [...] "note-perfect." ...|$|E
500|$|Hopkins was {{generally}} expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 {{that he would}} only be interested if the script was [...] "really good". Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he couldn’t {{make up his mind}} to commit. [...] "I was kind of surprised by this book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t make up my mind about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short [...] "to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got... in his way".|$|E

This is <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> I don't think Russian authorities or even secret-services heads are as incompetent as to not understand this," [...] Kagarlitsky said. [...] "Because this is happening under {{the eyes of the}} whole of Europe and to put it mildly, it doesn't improve the reputation of Russia and its current leaders." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pre-printed postcards to be {{sent home}} with stock phrases such as [...] "I am well" [...] and [...] "We have plenty of food" [...] were issued occasionally; Agnes Keith records that these were issued {{three times a year}} but in May 1945 it was decided that a certain {{percentage}} of the camp had to include a propaganda sentence in addition to the 25 permitted words of free text.

2500|$|Blake's {{trouble with}} {{authority}} {{came to a}} head in August 1803, when he was involved in a physical altercation with a soldier, John Schofield. Blake was charged not only with assault, but with uttering seditious and treasonable expressions against the king. [...] Schofield claimed that Blake had exclaimed [...] "Damn the king. The soldiers are all slaves." [...] Blake was cleared in the Chichester assizes of the charges. [...] According to a report in the Sussex county paper, [...] "he invented character of [...] was ... <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> an acquittal resulted".

50|$|Predators tend {{to lower}} the {{survival}} and fecundity of their prey, but on {{a higher level of}} organization, populations of predator and prey species also interact. It is <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> predators depend on prey for survival, and this is reflected in predator populations being affected by changes in prey populations. It is not <b>so</b> <b>obvious,</b> however, <b>that</b> predators affect prey populations. Eating a prey organism may simply make room for another if the prey population is approaching its carrying capacity.|$|R

2500|$|By December 1948, the {{ultimate}} {{success of the}} Communists was <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> the Director of the American Military Advisory Group of Nanking, Major General David Barr, told his superiors at the Pentagon that [...] "only a policy of unlimited United States aid including the immediate employment of United States armed forces to block the southern advance of the Communists, which I emphatically do not recommend, would enable the Nationalist Government to maintain a foothold in southern China against a determined Communist advance... The complete defeat of the Nationalist Army...is inevitable." [...] Over the next few months, the Communists gradually pushed back the Nationalists until finally capturing the capital of Nanking on April 24, 1949. The last of the Americans to leave China left Tsingtao on May 16, 1949.|$|E
2500|$|By December 1976, it {{was clear}} that the National Christmas Tree planted just three years earlier was dying. The {{appearance}} of the tree had deteriorated significantly, with many of the lower branches dead or damaged and many parts of the tree showing large areas of dead needles. Government horticulturalists said the tree had suffered root damage and had not thrived in the hot, damp climate of Washington, D.C. David Rhoads, a citizen from Silver Spring, Maryland, donated his [...] tall blue spruce to the National Park Service, chopped off its branches and wired many of them to the lower part of the existing tree to cover up the damage. The tree's plight was <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> the public made 112 offers for a new living tree to the government by early December.|$|E
2500|$|Brandes now {{took his}} place as the leading {{northern}} European critic, applying to local conditions and habits of thought the methods of Taine. He became Docent or reader in Aesthetics at the University of Copenhagen, where his lectures were a great success and gathered huge audiences. His famous opening lecture on 3 November 1871, Hovedstrømninger i det 19de Aarhundredes Litteratur (...) , signalled {{the beginning of his}} lifelong struggle to modernize Danish literature. After the professorship of aesthetics became vacant in 1872, it was taken {{as a matter of course}} that Brandes would fill it. But the young critic had offended many sensibilities by his ardent advocacy of modern ideas; he was seen as a Jew (which he did not consider himself to be), his convictions were Radical, he was suspected of being an atheist. The authorities refused to appoint him, but his fitness for the post was <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> the chair of Aesthetics remained vacant for years, since no one else daring to place himself in comparison with Brandes.|$|E

2500|$|Other reviews {{were also}} {{critical}} of the episode's lack of scientific accuracy, mainly around Earth's moon. Writing for Slate, Phil Plait remarked, [...] "The science mistakes were so egregious and <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> they kept pulling me {{right out of the}} story. A lot of the mistakes were fixable with a simple Google search." [...] In his review for Doctor Who TV, Clint Hassell had a similar objection. While he praised both the actors' performances and the story's ability to [...] "examine aspects of the human condition", he said the episode was [...] "also terrible, presenting a version of science so incorrect that it almost creates a new genre – 'not-so-science fiction'". Though part of the fun of the show is [...] "obviously make-believe, sciencey-wiencey facts and jargon", he believed that, [...] "When [...] states blatantly wrong science 'facts' because the writer couldn’t be bothered to think rationally, or consult a scientist, that makes the Doctor look like an idiot, and...ruins part of the believability of the show." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} extensive negative reviews at {{the time}} of its release and by modern film historians. Variety was particularly negative. Calling the movie [...] "derivative", the industry trade publication said, [...] "Summarizing the plot of Beginning of the End is like rehashing the story of several dozen similar films." [...] The publication felt that not much effort had been put into the film. [...] "Even taken on its own terms—as a low-budget exploitation feature—Beginning of the End hardly reflects the best effort of a major theatre circuit." [...] It called the special effects [...] "obvious" [...] and decried the use of stock footage. The reviewer felt the screenplay was [...] "ludicrous" [...] and cliché-ridden. The magazine believed Peter Graves had turned in a decent performance, but described Peggie Castle's performance as [...] "unconvincing" [...] and Morris Ankrum's as [...] "artificial". The cinematography and editing were, it concluded, average. Mae Tinnee, reviewing the motion picture for the Chicago Tribune had several negative comments. [...] "The film obviously was made on a shoestring budget, and the people in it are no more than props for the magnified insects. I doubt if it will fool anyone. But youngsters will probably think it's great stuff." [...] The Los Angeles Times was far harsher in its assessment. Its unsigned review concluded: [...] "The audience is cheated in the production. The conclusion is never in doubt and the process shots are <b>so</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> one is startled the first time a buffalo-sized grasshopper hits the screen but never again. And at no time are there more than a half-dozen of the things shown at once, although the script avers that there are thousands about and more coming." [...] As of 2008, Beginning of the End is still [...] "one of the most excoriated creature features." [...] Leonard Maltin summed up his review in one word: [...] "awful". Another recent film guide called it [...] "Bottom-of-the-sci-fi-barrel rubbish, very boring to watch." [...] One review pointed out that Gordon didn't even bother to hide the mountains in the background of the shots (Central Illinois is mostly flat prairie land). Some have also been upset with film's lack of horrifying images. The derivative nature of the picture has also upset some critics. Critics say the film covered almost the same ground as the far superior monster movie Them!, and it is clear that Gordon merely wanted to [...] "cash in" [...] on giant bug craze rather than come up with a story that was fresh and creative.|$|E

The historical focus upon carrying full loads, sometimes of only one product, reduces the unit cost of transport but has sometimes hidden the true costs associated with achieving those transport discounts. It is also possible to gain some of these benefits by 'faking' frequent deliveries at the supply site.|$|R
