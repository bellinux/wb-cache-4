The last essay turns to the field of vertical intrafirm trade, where I build an incomplete contract framework to show that the number of foreign affiliates (extensive margin) accounts for a greater share of the changes in aggregate intrafirm trade than the variation in the average exports per affiliate (intensive margin).

40|$|This study {{examines}} the main bank relationship in SME finance, targeting solely SMEs using regional financial institutions (regional banks, second-tier regional banks, and credit associations) as their main banks and empirically analyzing {{the correlation between}} main bank efficiency and lending attitude. Conventionally, individual financial statement information such as non-performing loan ratios and capital adequacy ratio were used as indicators of the soundness of main banks in the previous literature, but cost efficiency calculated using a stochastic frontier approach is a superior indicator for showing differences in relative soundness, since this indicator is derived from and reflects the production cost structure of the banking industry as a whole. The empirical results gained from this study can be summarized as follows: Firstly, when the relationship between indicators such as non-performing loan ratios and cost efficiency was examined to check the use of cost efficiency {{as an indicator of}} soundness, it was confirmed that cost efficiency is a comprehensive indicator significantly influenced by key balance sheet information. Secondly, concerning the impact of cost efficiency on lending attitude, it became evident that the more cost efficient the main bank, the more positive a response it gave to borrowers' requests for additional funds. Further, the results showed that the more cost efficient the main banks, the more they tended to place less severe demands on borrowers in terms of existing <b>borrowing</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Finally, with regard to the correlation between lending attitude and changes in a main bank's cost efficiency, {{it has been suggested that}} main banks that raised short-term interest rates on existing loans or requested to increase savings were more likely to improve their cost efficiency in the following fiscal year. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{research}} into the implications of labour market change for a sample of 500 first time home buyers in South Australia (SA). Increased job insecurity is presumed to be impacting on home ownership aspirations and sustainabilty across all income groups but is largely untested. While Australia {{has one of the}} highest casual employment rates among developed countries, SA stands out within the nation as being the most precarious labour market. SA experienced a net loss of 20, 000 full time jobs in the decade 1990 to 2000 with part time and casual employment the main job growth area. Australia’s welfare and housing polices have been predicated for fifty years on the perceived merits of home ownership. Welfare benefits both during employment and on retirement have been based on household investment being extended over time through home ownership. Thus any significant change in purchaser behaviour particularly in the cohort who would traditionally have entered home ownership as early as possible, merits review. The main research instrument was a postal survey of first time homebuyers who made their purchase during the period 1 st January 1999 to 31 st December 2000. The study area included the Adelaide metropolitan area and the rural townships of Mount Gambier, Murray Bridge and Port Lincoln. The survey aimed to determine first time buyer profiles including the nature of their employment, their expectations and attitudes to job security, and if and how, this had influenced the timing, location, <b>borrowing</b> <b>arrangements,</b> or nature of their home purchase.

40|$|Senior {{officials}} of East Asian governments and central banks will hold several meetings between February and May 2009 to consider, among other things, transforming the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) from {{a network of}} bilateral swap arrangements into a collectively managed fund [...] which they refer to as "CMI multilateralisation. " The region's disaffection from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), stemming from the 1997 - 98 financial crisis, sustains the attraction of such a fund among the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus China, Japan, and South Korea (ASEAN+ 3). The present financial crisis presents a moment of truth for ASEAN+ 3 : Are they serious about regional financial cooperation? Creating a common regional fund would require addressing questions of obligations, contributions, and rights of members {{as well as the}} size, governance, and <b>borrowing</b> <b>arrangements.</b> ASEAN+ 3 officials appear to be converging on $ 120 billion as the size of the fund. But they have yet to decide on the specific contributions from each member and exactly how joint decisions will be made. The shares of China and Japan are particularly important, because they will determine the relative influence of the two countries. Henning argues that CMI multilateralisation could contribute to the global financial architecture by supplementing the resources of the IMF and streamlining negotiations over financial rescues. ASEAN+ 3 should develop their own surveillance mechanism further with assistance of international financial institutions. Given the current weakness of regional surveillance, however, East Asian governments should continue to link their bilateral swaps and any common fund to the IMF. Henning urges the international community to establish guidelines for the respective roles of regional facilities, the IMF and other international financial institutions. ...|$|R

40|$|The SWRLS Open Doors {{project was}} a {{partnership}} between LibrariesWest (led by South Gloucestershire Library Service) and UWE Bristol Library Services and funded by SWRLS (South Western Regional Library Service). The aim was to pilot a reciprocal borrowing scheme between public and academic libraries using existing cards, i. e. public library cards in the academic library and university ID cards in the public libraries. The pilot looked at the scheme {{in terms of the}} following: the ease with which it was to set up, its limitations, barriers or obstacles and how these could be overcome, how popular it was both with staff and customers (i. e. members of the public or UWE staff and students). The report details {{the way in which the}} pilot was run, considers information from other higher and further education institutions and relevant literature, looks at other schemes in the UK and outlines the issues that were identified. The users of the scheme were surveyed – staff and customers – and their responses analysed. The report concludes that the reciprocal use of existing library cards between institutions and public libraries in a geographical area: was relatively simple once set up, was appreciated by all those who participated, had few teething problems, has had no appreciable impact on the availability of academic stock to UWE students, increased public library as well as academic library usage by target groups, e. g. school students 16 years and over, enabled the public library service to provide a significantly better offer of resources to its community, especially those who needed access to specialised stock not normally available in a general public library service. The Project Board recommends that this reciprocal <b>borrowing</b> <b>arrangement</b> continues between UWE and LibrariesWest and that other similar partnerships would benefit where they are geographically linked.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} how new credit risk transfer vehicles have {{made it easier to}} reallocate large amounts of credit risk from the financial sector to the non-financial sector of the capital markets. In this article, we describe one of these new credit risk transfer vehicles, the collateralized debt obligation. Synthetic credit debt obligations utilize credit default swaps, another relatively new credit risk transfer vehicle. Financial institutions face five major risks: credit, interest rate, price, currency, and liquidity. The development of the derivatives markets prior to 1990 provided financial institutions with efficient vehicles for the transfer of interest rate, price, and currency risks, as well as enhancing the liquidity of the underlying assets. However, it is only in recent years that the market for the efficient transfer of credit risk has developed. Credit risk is the risk that a debt instrument will decline in value {{as a result of the}} borrower's inability (real or perceived) to satisfy the contractual terms of its <b>borrowing</b> <b>arrangement.</b> In the case of corporate debt obligations, credit risk encompasses default, credit spread, and rating downgrade risks. The most obvious way for a financial institution to transfer the credit risk of a loan it has originated is to sell it to another party. Loan covenants typically require that the obligor be informed of the sale. The drawback of a sale in the case of corporate loans is the potential impairment of the originating financial institution's relationship with the obligor of the loan sold. Syndicated loans overcome the drawback of an outright sale because banks in the syndicate may sell their loan shares in the secondary market. The sale may be through an assignment or through participation. While the former mechanism for a syndicated loan requires the approval of the obligor, the latter does not since the payments are merely passed through to the purchaser and therefore the obligor need not know about the sale. Another form of credit risk transfer (CRT) vehicle developed in the 1980 s is securitization [Fabozzi and Kothari (2007) ]. In a securitization, a financial institution that originates loans pools them and sells them to a special purpose entity (SPE). The SPE obtains funds to acquire the pool of loans by issuing securities. Payment of interest and principal on the securities issued by the SPE is obtained from the cash flow of the pool of loans. While the financial institution employing securitization retains some of the credit risk associated with the pool of loans, the majority of the credit risk is transferred to the holders of the securities issued by the SPE. Two recent developments for transferring credit risk are credit derivatives and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). For financial institutions, credit derivatives allow the transfer of credit risk to another party without the sale of the loan. A CDO is an application of the securitization technology. With the development of the credit derivatives market, CDOs can be created without the actual sale of a pool of loans to an SPE using credit derivatives. CDOs created using credit derivatives are referred to as synthetic CDOs. In this article, we discuss CDOs. We begin with the basics of CDOs and then discuss synthetic CDOs. The issues for regulators and supervisors of capital markets with respect to CDOs, as well as credit derivatives, are also discussed.

These reductions also could apply to schools and shift costs to other local governments. The new spending limit {{could result in a}} smoother pattern of state expenditures over time, especially to the extent that reserves are set aside in good times and available in bad times. The provisions changing school funding formulas would make school and community college funding more subject to annual decisions of state policymakers and less affected by a constitutional funding guarantee.

40|$|In Cambodia, the {{interactions}} between large-scale land investment and land titling gathered particular momentum in 2012 – 13, when the government initiated an unprecedented upland land titling programme {{in an attempt to}} address land tenure insecurity where large-scale land investment overlaps with land appropriated by peasants. This paper is based on a spatially explicit ethnography of land rights conducted in the Samlaut district of north-west Cambodia – a former Khmer Rouge resistance stronghold – in a context where the enclosures are both incomplete and entangled with post-war, socially embedded land tenure systems.
