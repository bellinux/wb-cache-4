40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn experimental investigation {{was made to}} determine the aerodynamic response of a wind anemometer to unsteady air loads. The anemometer, a perforated drag sphere mounted upon a cylindrical pedestal, sensed dynamic pressure by a strain gage balance system. The anemometer response was calibrated for static and dynamic mechanical inputs and for steady aerodynamic loads prior to the unsteady investigation. The unsteady environment was obtained in an oscillating flow wind tunnel which utilizes a rotating <b>shutter</b> <b>valve</b> to superimpose a harmonically varying velocity upon a mean free stream. For steady flow conditions the anemometer drag coefficient remained essentially constant, apparently independent of Reynolds number. The anemometer responded well to the unsteady air loads at frequencies up to 20 cycles per second and mean dynamic pressures to 8. 85 pounds per square foot. Unsteady aerodynamic response was qualitatively substantiated by a quasi-steady approximation to the measured unsteady drag. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{its good}} {{physical}} properties, the glassy carbon material is not widely used, especially for structural applications. Nevertheless, its transparency to particles and temperature resistance are interesting properties for the applications to vacuum chambers and components in high energy physics. For example, {{it has been}} proposed for fast <b>shutter</b> <b>valve</b> in particle accelerator [1] [2]. The mechanical properties have to be carefully determined to assess the reliability of structures in such a material. In this paper, mechanical tests {{have been carried out}} to determine the elastic pa-rameters, the strength and toughness on commercial grades. A statistical approach, based on the Weibull’s distribution, is used to characterize the material both in tension and compression. The results are compared to the literature and the difference of properties for these two loading cases is shown. Based on a Finite Element analysis, a statistical approach is applied to define the relia-bility of a structural component in glassy carbon.

40|$|The {{design of}} the ITER ECRH system {{provides}} 20 &#xa 0;MW millimeter wave power for central plasma heating and MHD stabilization. The system consists of an array of 24 gyrotrons with power supplies coupled {{to a set of}} transmission lines guiding the beams to the four upper and the equatorial launcher. The front steering upper launcher design described herein has passed successfully the preliminary design review, and it is presently in the final design stage. The launcher consists of a millimeter wave system and steering mechanism with neutron shielding integrated into an upper port plug with the plasma facing blanket shield module (in-vessel) and a set of ex-vessel waveguides connecting the launcher to the transmission lines. Part of the transmission lines are the ultra-low loss CVD torus diamond windows and a <b>shutter</b> <b>valve,</b> a miter bend section and the feedthroughs integrated in the plug closure plate. These components are connected by corrugated waveguides and form together the first confinement system (FCS). In-vessel, the millimeter-wave system includes a quasi-optical beam propagation system including four mirror sets and a front steering mirror. The millimeter wave system is integrated into a specifically optimized upper port plug providing structural stability to withstand plasma disruption forces and the high heat load from the plasma side with a dedicated blanket shield module. A recent update in the ITER interface definition has resulted in the recession of the upper port plug first wall panels, which is now integrated into the design. Apart from the millimeter wave system the upper port plug houses also a set of shield blocks which provide neutron shielding. An overview of the actual ITER ECRH Upper Launcher is given together with some highlights of the design...|$|E
3000|$|Local droplet etching is {{performed}} in three steps: pre-growth annealing, droplet growth, and post-growth annealing. At {{the beginning of}} the pre-growth annealing step, the As 4 flux to the sample surface is reduced by closing the <b>shutter</b> and <b>valve</b> of the As cell as well as the main shutter in front of the sample. For samples with pre-growth overheating, the sample temperature is set to T= 670 °C for 120 s. Finally, the sample temperature is set to the LDE process temperature and the sample is 60 s annealed for surface smoothing.

30|$|After {{growth of}} a 100 -nm-thick GaAs buffer layer at a {{temperature}} T = 600 ℃ to smooth the surface, the As <b>shutter</b> and <b>valve</b> are closed and the temperature is increased to the annealing temperature of 630 ℃ to 670 ℃. Ga is the deposited for 2.5 s corresponding to a droplet material coverage θ= 2.0 ML. After deposition of the droplet material, the initial droplets are transformed into nanoholes during post-growth annealing for a time ta. After annealing, the samples are quenched by switching off the substrate heater. Figure 1 a shows a sketch of the whole process including the shape modification of the droplet etched nanoholes during long-time annealing, and Figure 1 b,c displays typical atomic force microscopy (AFM) images visualizing the different stages.|$|R
30|$|The samples {{discussed}} in the following are fabricated using solid-source MBE. After thermal oxide desorption, a 200 -nm-thick Al 0.35 Ga 0.65 As barrier layer was grown on a (001) GaAs substrate. We have fabricated two types of samples denoted in the following as type I and type II. For the type II samples, an additional 5 -nm-thick AlAs layer was grown {{on top of the}} AlGaAs layer. Now, the As <b>shutter</b> and <b>valve</b> were closed and Al droplet formation was initiated by opening the Al shutter for 6 s. The temperature was T = 620 °C for type I and T = 650 °C for type II samples. The Al flux corresponded to a growth speed of 0.47 ML/s and droplet material was deposited onto the surface with coverage of 2.8 ML. After droplet deposition, a thermal annealing step of 180 s was applied. During this time, the etching process takes place, liquid etching residues are removed, and a wall surrounding the nanoholes is formed [22].|$|R
30|$|We {{fabricate}} LDE nanoholes using solid-source {{molecular beam}} epitaxy (MBE) on (001) GaAs wafers. Two different sample designs {{will be discussed in}} the following, denoted as type I and type II. After growth of a GaAs buffer layer, a 200 -nm-thick Al 0.36 Ga 0.64 As barrier layer was deposited. For the samples of type II, an additional 5 -nm-thick AlAs layer was grown before LDE. Type I samples have no such AlAs layer. Afterward, the As <b>shutter</b> and <b>valve</b> were closed and droplet formation was initiated at a temperature T 1 by opening the Al shutter for a time t 1 = 6 s. We used Al droplets for etching in order to avoid an additional carrier confinement by the wall. The temperatures were T 1 = 620 ° for the type I samples and T 1 = 650 ° for the type II samples with the additional AlAs layer. During this stage, a strongly reduced arsenic flux is important [26]. The As flux in our experiments was approximately hundred times lower compared to typical GaAs growth conditions. The Al flux F corresponded to a growth speed of 0.47 ML/s, and droplet material was deposited onto the surface with coverage θ = F t 1. After droplet deposition, the temperature was set to a value T 2, and a thermal annealing step of time t 2 was applied in order to remove liquid etching residues. For the present samples, we have used T 2 = T 1 and t 2 = 180 s.|$|R
40|$|The ESRF {{operates}} {{eight of}} its forty beamlines without any physical {{separation of the}} Storage Ring (SR) vacuum and the experimental chambers. Protection of the SR vacuum against possible contamination is required. Partial pressure variations due to radiation-induced photodesorption should clearly be distinguished from pressure variations due to leaks or contamination. This involves further developments of the existing Residual Gas Analyser (RGA) system [1] {{in order to gain}} the necessary flexibility. 1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION Beam lines without any physical separation to the SR vacuum system have a specific vacuum layout and also additional interlock features. Triggered by total pressure signals, the interlock system protects the SR vacuum against accidental venting due to material failures or human error [2, 3]. Residual gas analysers are installed between the Front End and beam lines limiting gate valves. In order to continuously protect the SR vacuum it is necessary to include the partial pressure measurement in an alarm system. This signal, connected to the standard Front End / beam line interlock system, will close <b>shutters</b> and gate <b>valves</b> to isolate the vacuum sections...|$|R
