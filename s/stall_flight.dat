5000|$|A {{deep stall}} (or super-stall) is a {{dangerous}} type of stall that affects certain aircraft designs, notably jet aircraft with a T-tail configuration and rear-mounted engines. In these designs, the turbulent wake of a stalled main wing, nacelle-pylon wakes and the wake from the fuselage [...] "blanket" [...] the horizontal stabilizer, rendering the elevators ineffective and preventing the aircraft from recovering from the stall. Taylor states T-tail propeller aircraft, unlike jet aircraft, do not usually require a stall recovery system during <b>stall</b> <b>flight</b> testing due to increased airflow over the wing root from the prop wash. Nor do they have rear mounted nacelles which can contribute substantially to the problem.The A400M was fitted with a vertical tail booster for some flight tests in case of deep stall.|$|E
5000|$|The {{very high}} [...] for a deep stall locked-in {{condition}} occurs {{well beyond the}} normal stall but can be attained very rapidly as the aircraft is unstable beyond the normal stall and requires immediate action to arrest it. The loss of lift causes high sink rates which, together with the low forward speed at the normal stall, give a high [...] {{with little or no}} rotation of the aircraft. BAC 1-11 G-ASHG, during <b>stall</b> <b>flight</b> tests before the type was modified to prevent a locked-in deep stall condition, descended at over 10000 ft/min m/s and struck the ground in a flat attitude moving only 70 ft forward after initial impact. Sketches which show how the wing wake blankets the tail may be misleading if they imply that deep stall requires a high body angle. Taylor and Ray show how the aircraft attitude in the deep stall is relatively flat, even less than during the normal stall, with very high negative flight path angles.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that, {{according}} to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) terminology, the above example illustrates a so-called turning <b>flight</b> <b>stall,</b> while the term accelerated is used to indicate an accelerated turning stall only, that is, a turning <b>flight</b> <b>stall</b> where the airspeed decreases at a given rate.|$|R
5000|$|The LRI uses a three zone, red-white-green display.

The white zone is near the <b>stall</b> where <b>flight</b> controls soften, angle of attack is high, and the unused POWL is diminished. The top of the red zone defines {{the beginning of the}} stall. The severity of stall increases as the needle travels deeper into the red. During the takeoff, the LRI uses dynamic pressure to operate and will not lift the needle above the red zone until enough airspeed energy is available to fly.|$|R
40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} test program was {{conducted}} on an eight foot diameter model rotor system to determine blade element airloads characteristics in the unstalled and <b>stalled</b> <b>flight</b> regimes. The fully articulated model rotor system utilized three blades with a Vertol 23010 - 1. 58 airfoil section, the blades being 1 / 7. 5 scale models of the Ch- 47 C rotor blades. Instrumentation was incorporated at the blade 75 % radial station to measure pressure and skin friction distributions, surface streamline directions and local angle of attack. The test program was conducted in three phases; non-rotating, hover and forward flight at advance ratios of 0. 15, 0. 35 and 0. 60. Test data were analyzed with respect to providing insight to the mechanisms affecting blade stall, particularly retreating blade <b>stall</b> during forward <b>flight</b> conditions. From such data, an assessment was made as to the applicability of current theoretical analyses used for the prediction of blade element airloads in the stall regime...|$|R
5000|$|Ninety-six of the {{one hundred}} and five persons on board were fatally injured by impact forces and post-crash fire as the {{majority}} of the fuselage section of the aircraft was destroyed. One cabin crew member, aft seated, survived along with eight other passengers as the structure in their immediate environment remained substantially intact.Analysis from black box: Just before takeoff, the crew confirmed reports of windshear, as evident from the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). During takeoff, the intensity of the rain increased to heavy. The first sign of difficulty was heard on the CVR just two seconds after the first officer called [...] "eighty knots". The captain replied with [...] "Ah" [...] instead of saying [...] "checked". Four seconds later, the landing gear was retracted and the V2 callout was given by the first officer. Two seconds after the V2 callout, a windshear warning was triggered, as the aircraft experienced a rapid change in wind direction. In trying to recover, the crew pitched the nose up to between 30° and 35° as revealed by the FDR, thereby greatly exceeding the critical angle of attack, activating the stick-shaker (as confirmed by the cockpit voice recorder). As a result of the high pitch attitude, the airflow into the engines was disrupted causing the both engines to experience a compressor <b>stall.</b> <b>Flight</b> control inputs by the crew resulted in an aerodynamic stall, altitude loss, and subsequent ground impact. As a result of the rapid descent, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) was indicated to have been producing terrain warnings until impact.|$|E

40|$|Summary. A Fourier {{collocation}} based time-spectral {{method is}} used to simulate helicopter rotor flows under high-speed transonic and highly-loaded dynamic stall conditions. Computations are performed using fully coupled CFD/Comprehensive Analysis, where the Comprehensive Analysis supplies finite element CSD and aircraft trim capabilities. The {{focus is on the}} prediction of vibratory airloads of an isolated rotor. The accuracy of spectral method is compared with a time-accurate analysis, both trimmed consistently to the same flight condition. Two UH- 60 A flights are simulated – Counters 8534 and 9017 from the U. S. Army/NASA Airloads Program – a high vibration flight and a deep dynamic <b>stall</b> <b>flight.</b> For the high vibration flight, the fastest and minimal implementation of the method, with 11 time instances for a 4 -bladed rotor, predicts the vibratory lift and pitching moments within 5 – 10 % accuracy of time-accurate simulations in about one-fifth the computational time. The largest errors occur in vibratory chord forces (10 to 20 %). The minimal implementation is not adequate under dynamic stall conditions, as expected, where significant higher-harmonic content (6 /rev and higher) produce aliasing errors in the harmonics of interest. ...|$|E
40|$|This study predicts, analyzes, and {{isolates}} {{the mechanisms}} of main rotor airloads, structural loads, and swashplate servo loads in a severe unsteady maneuver. The objective is, to develop a comprehensive transient rotor analysis for predicting maneuver loads. The main rotor structural loads encountered during unsteady maneuvers are important to size different critical components of the rotor system, particularly for advanced combat helicopters. These include the blade structural loads, control/pitch-link loads, and swashplate servo loads. Accurate and consistent prediction of maneuver loads is necessary to reduce the risks and costs associated with use of prior flight test data {{as a basis for}} design. The mechanism of rotor loads in different level flight regimes is well understood [...] transonic shock in high speed flight, inter-twinning of blade tip vortices below the rotor disk at low speed transonic flight, and two dynamic stall cycles on retreating blade during high altitude dynamic <b>stall</b> <b>flight.</b> All these physical phenomena can occur simultaneously during a maneuver. The goal is to understand the key mechanisms involved in maneuver and model them accurately. To achieve this, the aerodynamics and structural dynamics of UH- 60 A rotor in unsteady maneuvering flight is studied separately. For identification of prediction deficiencies in each, first, the measured lift, drag, pitching moment and damper force from the UH- 60 A Flight Test Program for UTTAS pull-up maneuver (C 11029 : 2. 16 g pull-up maneuver) are used to obtain an accurate set of deformations. A multibody finite element blade model, developed for this purpose, is used to perform measured airloads analysis. Next, the resultant blade deformations are used to predict the airloads using lifting-line and RANS CFD aerodynamic models. Both lifting-line as well as CFD analyses predict all three stall cycles with prescribed deformations. From the airloads predicted using prescribed deformations, it is established that the advancing blade transonic stall, observed from revolution 12 onwards, is a twist stall triggered by 5 /rev elastic twist deformation resulting in shock induced flow separation. The 5 /rev elastic twist is triggered by the two retreating blade stalls from previous revolution, which are separated by 1 / 5 th rev. The accurate prediction of both stall cycles on retreating blade holds the key to prediction of advancing blade stall. In analysis, advancing blade stall is triggered by a correct combination of control angles and 5 /rev elastic twist. Some discrepancies are observed in higher harmonics of predicted torsion moment, which are not resolved by using measured airloads. The structural model and the aerodynamic models are coupled together to predict blade loads for the maneuver. The structural model is refined to include a three degrees of freedom swashplate model to calculate servo loads and to study the effect of swashplate dynamics on rotor loads. Lifting-line coupled analysis, though of low fidelity, is ideally suited to isolate the effects of free wake and dynamic stall. It is concluded that the UTTAS maneuver is almost entirely dominated by stall with little or no wake induced effect on blade loads, even though the wake cuts through the disk twice during the maneuver. At the peak of the maneuver, almost 75 % of the operating envelope of a typical airfoil lies beyond stall. The peak-to-peak structural loads prediction from the lifting-line analysis show an under-prediction of 10 %- 20 % in flap and chord bending moments and 50 % in torsion loads. The errors stem from the prediction of 4 and 5 /rev stall loads. Swashplate dynamics appears to {{have a significant impact on}} the servo loads - unlike in level flight - with more than 50 % variation in peak loads. The coupled analysis using CFD/CSD tight coupling shows considerable improvements in the predicted results by using a CFD model over a traditional lifting-line approach. In particular, the coupled CFD/CSD simulation is able to correctly predict the magnitude and phasing of the two dynamic stall cycles on the retreating side of the rotor disk during the maneuver. Further it shows significant improvement in the predicted peak-to-peak structural loads. The advancing blade stall is not predicted by either of the analyses. CFD/CSD analysis is not able to predict the advancing blade stall due to less satisfactory prediction of retreating blade dynamics stall cycles which are sensitive to the grid refinements and turbulence modeling...|$|E

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the autorotational {{characteristics}} of certain differing wing systems as determined from wind tunnel tests made at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory. The investigation was confined to autorotation about a fixed axis in the plane of symmetry and parallel to the wind direction. Analysis of the tests leads to the following conclusions: autorotation below 30 degree angle of attack is governed chiefly by wing profile, and above that angle by wing arrangement. The strip method of autorotation analysis gives uncertain results between maximum C subscript L and 35 degrees. The polar curve of a wing system, and to a lower degree of accuracy the polar of a complete airplane model are sufficient for direct determination {{of the limits of}} rotary instability, subject to strip method limitations. The results of the investigation indicate that in free flight a monoplane is incapable of flat spinning, whereas an unstaggered biplane has inherent flat-spinning tendencies. The difficulty of maintaining equilibrium in <b>stalled</b> <b>flight</b> is due primarily to rotary instability, a rapid change from stability to instability occurring as the angle of maximum lift is exceeded.
