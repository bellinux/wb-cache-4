40|$|In {{order to}} map the {{quantitative}} trait loci for rice stripe resistance, a molecular linkage map was constructed based on the F 2 population derived from a cross between Zhaiyeqing 8 and Wuyujing 3. Reactions of the two parents, F 1 individual and 129 F 2 : 3 lines to rice stripe were investigated by both artificial inoculation at laboratory and natural infection in the field, and the ratios of disease rating index were scored. The distribution of the ratios of disease rating index in Zhaiyeqing 8 /Wuyujing 3 F 2 : 3 population ranged from 0 to 134. 08 and from 6. 25 to 133. 6 under artificial inoculation at laboratory and natural infection in the field, respectively, and showed a marked bias towards resistant parent (Zhaiyeqing 8), indicating that the resistance to rice stripe was controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTL). QTL analysis showed that the QTLs detected by the two inoculation methods were completely different. Only one QTL, qSTV 7, was detected under artificial inoculation, at which the Zhaiyeqing 8 allele increased the resistance to rice stripe, while two QTLs, qSTV 5 and qSTV 1, were detected under natural infection, in which resistant alleles came from Zhaiyeqing 8 and Wuyujing 3, respectively. These results showed that resistant parent Zhaiyeqing 8 carried the alleles associated with the resistance to rice stripe virus and the small brown planthopper, and susceptible parent Wuyujing 3 also carried the resistant allele to rice stripe virus. In comparison with the results previously reported, QTLs detected {{in the study were}} new resistant genes to rice stripe disease.

However, biological activities of ITCs in combinations had not been well defined. The present study evaluated the potential efficacy of AIT, SFN and their combinations on three important biological properties: anticancer, anti-inflammation and antioxidant. Our {{results showed that the}} combination between AIT and SFN led to a stronger growth inhibition on A 549 non-small cell lung cancer cells than treatments with the individual compounds. The enhanced effect was proved to be synergistic by isobologram analysis. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the combination treatment caused more extensive cell cycle arrest and cellular apoptosis in the cancer cells than the singular treatment. In addition, a synergy between AIT and SFN was also observed in their anti-cell migration. It is noteworthy that the AIT-SFN combination resulted in the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which might contribute to their inhibitory effects on cancer cells. In terms of anti-inflammation, the combination of AIT and SFN both pairing between themselves (AIT-SFN), and pairing with other dietary bioactives (AIT-CUR, AIT-LUT, and SFN-LUT) enhanced this beneficial property in comparison to a <b>single</b> compound <b>utilization</b> in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264. 7 macrophages.

40|$|We {{consider}} mathematical {{models of}} multiprogrammed computer systems {{expressed in the}} form of closed queueing networks. Such models have traditionally required detailed parameters (e. g., transition probabilities, meanservice times) for both their specification and solution. The primary goal of this thesis is to investigate the extent to which easily-measured operational data can be used in queueing network analysis. Much of the discussion pertains to centralized networks, which generalize the central server model of Buzen in that a customer need not return immediately to the central server after having completed service at a peripheral server. A new methodology of network analysis which proceeds by way of considering nested similarity transformations of a network's transition matrix is introduced. Using this method we derive, for centralized networks, eigenvector equations for the mean number of per-customer visits to each server and the mean total per-customer service time (i. e., mean resource usage) for each server. We show that for separable centralized networks having simple load-independent (SLI) servers, mean resource usages alone are sufficient for determining both a network solution and all associated marginal distributions. Further applying the method of similarity transformations, we prove that a general flow conservation equation is equivalent to the condition that server utilization ratios remain invariant with respect to the level of multiprogramming. For separable networks which are not necessarily centralized, the product-form solution of Gordon and Newel 1 is used to develop a new equation relating server utilization to a network's solution parameters. The equation is coupled with the recent operational results of Denning and Buzen to show that for networks having SLI servers, <b>single</b> device <b>utilizations</b> measured at consecutive levels of multiprogramming can be used to derive mean queue lengths and certain marginal distributions pertinent to the device. An algorithm is then presented for deriving multiprogrammed device utilizations given only the mono-programmed utilizations of all devices.

Total knee arthroplasty, or replacement, is a common, generally successful, and expensive procedure. Tools to predict outcomes following orthopedic procedures are abundant, yet no commonly used assessment accounts for an individual’s propensity to engage in adaptive health behavior. The 13 -item Patient Activation Measure (PAM) questionnaire is a tool that quantifies a patient’s ability and confidence in managing their healthcare needs. A patient who is highly activated has the knowledge and skill to navigate the healthcare system and engage in healthy behaviors. A patient who scores within PAM Level 4 has an ability to maintain healthy behaviors (highest level); Level 3 patients are taking action toward managing their health; Level 2 patients are building confidence; and Level 1 patients are not yet taking a role. The PAM assessment may help fill a pocket-of-need in the surgeon’s pre-operative evaluation of surgical readiness and post-acute risk. This study reports results of retrospective analysis of a double-blinded, prospective cohort study designed to assess the role of patient activation in a population of orthopedic surgical patients. The hypothesis is lower pre-operative patient activation scores are associated with higher costs incurred, higher post-operative service utilization, and lower patient-reported outcome measures {{in the first three}} months following total knee arthroplasty (TKA), commonly referred to as total knee replacement. Methods. The study population includes 754 patients who elected to undergo primary, unilateral total knee arthroplasty, with no contralateral procedure during the study period, performed by surgeons at a single orthopedic clinic in Oregon, at two participating hospital sites between September 2014 and December 2015. Patients consented to be included in the research study under an alternative consenting process via an iPad application. Retrospectively, two different data sources were available: (1) patient survey data and (2) administrative billing data. Survey data were collected prospectively from patients pre-operatively and at three months (± one month) post-operatively.

40|$|The {{presence}} of a bacterial community {{is vital to the}} germination and growth of the toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum. Previous research has shown that the bacterium Alcanivorax DG 881 is an important stimulatory member of the dinoflagellate-associated bacterial community, however the nature of the interaction between the two organisms, and the substances and mechanism involved in growth stimulation are unknown. This thesis uses a uni-bacterial G. catenatum experimental culture model to investigate elements of the interaction between the marine bacterium Alcanivorax DG 881 with the dinoflagellate G. catenatum. In the first experiment, three treatments were used to determine whether the G. catenatum growth stimulating substances produced by Alcanivorax DG 881 were extracellular or intracellular substances, and whether these substances need to be continuously provided to G. catenatum to support growth. Addition of extracellular filtrates from cultures of G. catenatum and it’s associated bacteria showed increased growth stimulating activity in resting cyst germination experiments compared to treatments containing intracellular substances from Alcanivorax DG 881 in absence of live Alcanivorax DG 881 cells. Repeated addition of extracellular filtrates sustained G. catenatum growth after germination for a significantly longer period and to higher cell concentrations than a single addition of extracellular filtrate. These results indicated that the G. catenatum did not obtain growth stimulating substances by ingesting bacteria but requires one or more extracellular dissolved products produced by Alcanivorax DG 881. The patterns of growth suggest that the products were either labile or utilised by the dinoflagellate during growth. It has been proposed that dinoflagellate-associated Alcanivorax DG 881 benefits from the utilization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exuded from the dinoflagellate cell. To examine this idea, the <b>single</b> carbon <b>utilization</b> profile of Alcanivorax DG 881 was compared with the closely related but no-stimulatory strain Alcanivorax borkumensis SK 2 using the BIOLOG GN 2 plate assay system. Alcanivorax DG 881 was able to use a much wider range of carbon compounds for growth than Alcanivorax borkumensis SK 2, particular a wider range of amino acids, known as {{an important component of the}} DOC exuded from algal cells. The data here suggest that Alcanivorax DG 881 is relatively better adapted to a life associated with algal cells than Alcanivorax borkumensis SK 2. Detection and sequence characterization of putative saxitoxin synthesis gene homologues was attempted. Degenerate PCR primers designed from sequence of three putative saxitoxin biosynthesis (Sxt) genes from cyanobacteria was used to screen G. catenatum total DNA extracts. PCR products of expected length were obtained for three Sxt genes and two products were sequenced and compared to the putative cyanobacterial homolog and other published DNA sequences available on Genbank.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Stereochemistry {{is often}} used in the {{development}} of drugs. Enantiomers of a chiral drug are two non-superimposable mirror images of the molecule and a racemic mixture consists of equal quantities of both enantiomers. This study looks at the phenomenon of “chiral switching” where a molecule previously developed and marketed by an innovator company as a racemate medicine is later developed and launched as a <b>single</b> enantiomer. Drug <b>utilization</b> and market share data of three molecules that underwent chiral switching were investigated retrospectively to determine the clinical and economic impact of these occurrences in the private South African pharmaceutical market. METHOD: Unit sales and rand sales data of the racemate (and its generics) and the single enantiomer of three drug substance pairs, namely omeprazole-esomeprazole, citalopram-escitalopram and cetirizine-levocetirizine were gathered a year preceding the launch of the single enantiomer to three years subsequent to the launch of the single enantiomer onto the private market. DATA ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistical analysis included plotting trend lines of the annual unit and rand sales of both the racemate (and its generics) and the single enantiomer products during the study period, pie charts illustrating the year on year differences in market share (in both unit sales and rand value of sales) as well as box and whisker plots of the racemate and its generics plotted for the year before the single enantiomer was launched, the year after its launch, two years after launch and three years after launch. The probability of the enantiomer being prescribed/ sold instead of the racemate at different time points was also calculated to determine whether the drug <b>utilization</b> of the <b>single</b> enantiomer increased or decreased from introduction until three years subsequent to its launch. CONCLUSION: Results were consistent with global literature indicating that “chiral switching’ is a successful strategy employed by innovator companies to extend their market share. Drug <b>utilization</b> of the <b>single</b> enantiomer generally showed an upward trend following its launch indicating that there is a perceived belief of enhanced clinical outcomes for the patient.

We draw upon established theory from the fields of strategy and strategic human resource management to explain AirAsia's minimalist approach to human resource management. In particular, we apply Porter's well known theory of generic business strategies and Schuler and Jackson's model linking HR practices to competitive strategy, to argue that the airline's successful quest for market cost leadership has been supported by a strict focus on Legge's ‘hard’ variety of HRM. It is further argued that while a number of the components of the Southwest Airlines model are evident, there are also significant differences in AirAsia's management of human resources. In particular, it is argued that the airline has adopted a far stronger cost minimization and ‘hard’ HRM path that is closer to Ryanair's model, which has proved highly successful for the airline in South East Asia...|$|R
40|$|Although it is {{generally}} accepted that planting exotic plant species alters metabolic function of soil microbial communities, its temporal dynamic is often ignored when evaluating ecological effects of associated land use changes. To investigate the dynamic impacts of successive Eucalyptus planting on carbon metabolic activities of soil microbial communities, we studied community-level physiological profiles of soil microbial communities in different generations of Eucalyptus plantations. We studied community-level physiological profiles of soil microbial communities, using the Biolog (TM) Ecoplates incubation, in adjacent first (G 1), second (G 2), third (G 3), and fourth (G 4) generation Eucalyptus plantations that were, respectively, aged 3, 8, 14, and 19 years in Guangxi province, southern China. We used the 'space-for-time substitution' approach to investigate the impact of stand age of exotic Eucalyptus plantations on carbon metabolic diversity and activities of soil microbial communities. For each Eucalyptus plantation generation, three experimental plots were randomly selected. In each plot, one composite soil sample from 0 to 10 cm in depth was obtained for the analyses. <b>Single</b> carbon source <b>utilization</b> varied with Eucalyptus plantation stand age. Among preselected 31 carbon sources, utilization of 17 carbon sources changed significantly, which was best described by a quadratic function (ten carbon sources) and an exponential function (seven carbon sources). As a result, cumulative averaged metabolic activity and metabolic diversity of soil microbial communities showed quadratic and exponential changes relative to Eucalyptus plantation stand age. The order of cumulative averaged carbon metabolic activity and metabolic diversity were G 1 > G 4, G 3 > G 2 and G 1 > G 2 > G 3, G 4 (p < 0. 05), respectively. The factors contributing to carbon source utilization structure of soil microbial communities for different stand ages of Eucalyptus plantations were shrub richness, soil organic carbon content, microbial biomass carbon, C-to-N ratio, and N-to-P ratio. Eucalyptus plantation stand age has inconsistent non-linear impacts on two aspects of soil microbial metabolic function: (1) quadratic impacts on carbon metabolic efficiency and (2) exponential impacts on carbon metabolic diversity. The decreasing carbon metabolic diversity has no significant impact on carbon metabolic efficiency during successive Eucalyptus plantings. The {{results show that the}} importance of assessing long-term impacts of land use changes on soil microbial communities from exotic plantations by quantifying multi-aspect non-linear changes on soil microbial metabolic function...|$|R
