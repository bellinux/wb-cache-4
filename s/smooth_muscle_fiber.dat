50|$|When {{a smooth}} muscle cell is depolarized, it causes {{opening of the}} {{voltage-gated}} (L-type) calcium channels. Depolarization may be brought about by stretching of the cell, agonist-binding its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), or autonomic nervous system stimulation. Opening of the L-type calcium channel causes influx of extracellular Ca2+, which then binds calmodulin. The activated calmodulin molecule activates myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), which phosphorylates the myosin in thick filaments. Phosphorylated myosin is able to form crossbridges with actin thin filaments, and the <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> (i.e., cell) contracts via the sliding filament mechanism. (See reference for an illustration of the signaling cascade involving L-type calcium channels in smooth muscle).|$|E
5000|$|A precapillary {{sphincter}} is a band {{of smooth}} muscle that adjusts blood flow into capillaries mainly in the mesenteric microcirculation. At the point where each of the capillaries originates from an arteriole, a <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> encircles the capillary. This is called the precapillary sphincter. The sphincter can open and close {{the entrance to the}} capillary, by which contraction causes blood flow in a capillary to change as vasomotion occurs. [...] The entire capillary bed may be bypassed by blood flow through arteriovenous anastomoses or through preferential flow through metarterioles. [...] If the sphincter is damaged or cannot contract, blood can flow into the capillary bed at high pressures. When capillary pressures are high (as per gravity, etc.), fluid passes out of the capillaries into the interstitial space, and edema or fluid swelling is the result.|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: <b>Smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> has {{fundamental}} {{importance in}} erection. Alterations in its function or quantity {{may be associated}} with erectile dysfunction. The study objective was to assess the proportion of penile <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> in patients with severe erectile dysfunction. DESIGN AND SETTING: Clinical study, in the Sexual Dysfunction Group, Universidade Federal de São Paulo (Unifesp), and in the Anatomy Laboratory, Universidade Estadual do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ). METHODS: Twenty patients with severe erectile dysfunction were selected to form two groups of ten patients: one with normal arterial flow (age range: 44 to 78 years) and the other with altered arterial flow (age range: 38 to 67 years). These groups were compared with a group formed by ten cadavers aged 18 to 25 years that were presumed to have been potent. Quantification of the smooth muscle fibers was done by means of an immunohistochemical study. RESULTS: The proportion of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> found was 41. 15 % for the control group. The patients with erectile dysfunction and normal arterial flow presented 27. 24 % and those with altered arterial flow presented 25. 74 %; 19 patients presented at least one chronic disease or risk factor for erectile dysfunction, with prominence for diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension and smoking. CONCLUSION: Among patients with severe erectile dysfunction, the arterial flow on its own does not present interference in the proportion of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber.</b> The diminution of the proportion of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> may result from chronic diseases and vascular risk factors...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} {{microscopic}} {{structure of the}} upper eyelid of Caucasians, in particular looking for evidence {{of the presence of}} <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> and the microscopic nature of the levator aponeurosis. METHODS: Full-thickness sagittal sections of central upper eyelids from 11 postmortem upper eyelids of 7 Caucasians (age range 78 - 101 years at death; mean age 87. 7 years) were examined. The samples were stained with Masson trichrome and were microscopically examined for the presence of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> and to determine whether the levator aponeurosis comprised one or more layers. RESULTS: All of the samples contained <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers,</b> which were located posteriorly. Evidence of a clear double-layer structure was found in only 1 sample; the other 10 samples demonstrated a single monolayer, which was not reflected to the orbital septum but continued distally. CONCLUSIONS: In this series of upper eyelid specimens of Caucasians, all aponeuroses contained <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers,</b> the distribution of which was more concentrated posteriorly, identical to previous findings in Asian eyelids and suggestive of a possible common mechanism of eyelid tension regulation between races. Most of the levator aponeuroses examined had evidence of a single monolayer only; this represents a further absolute difference in the microanatomical structure of the upper eyelids between Caucasians and Asians...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: We {{studied the}} effect of intracavernous oxygen tension on the {{alteration}} of cavernous <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> in potent and impotent men. Materials and Methods: Intracavernous oxygen tension (mm.

Cavernous biopsies were performed and the percent of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> was analyzed objectively using immunohistochemical actin anti- actin staining. Simultaneously brachial oxygen tension (mm. Hg) was measured and the cavernous brachial oxygen tension index was then determined. Results: At flaccidity no significant difference was noted in oxygen tension values among the 3 groups of patients. After prostaglandin E 1 injection cavernous oxygen tension and the cavernous brachial oxygen tension index {{in the control group}} were significantly different (p < 0. 01) from those of the venogenic and arteriogenic groups (p < 0. 01). The mean percent of cavernous <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> in the control group was significantly {{different from those of the}} venous leakage and arterial lesion groups (p < 0. 01). There was a good correlation between the percent of cavernous <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> and the value of oxygen tension before (p < 0. 05) and after prostaglandin E 1 injection (p < 0. 01). A similar correlation was noted between cavernous <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> and cavernous brachial oxygen tension index in the different groups of patients (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: Reduction of the intracavernous <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> in impotent patients could be explained by low intracavernous oxygen tension.

This study aims to analyze the development of the main components of the erectile tissue, such as collagen, <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> and elastic system fibers, in human fetuses.

40|$|AbstractDephosphorylation {{of the two}} key {{regulatory}} {{factors of}} myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), CPI 17 and MBS (myosin binding subunit) of MLCP was studied. While Thr 38 phosphorylated CPI 17 is quite susceptible to protein phosphatases, phosphorylated MBS was highly resistant to dephosphorylation. Type 2 A, 2 B and 2 C protein phosphatases (PP 2 A, PP 2 B and PP 2 C), but not type 1 (PP 1), dephosphorylated CPI 17. The majority of the CPI 17 phosphatase activity in smooth muscle was attributed to PP 2 A and PP 2 C. Phospholipids inhibited dephosphorylation of MBS and arachidonic acid (AA) inhibited PP 2 A activity against both MBS and CPI 17, raising the possibility that AA favors the preservation of active MLCP. Consistently, while the phosphorylation of CPI 17 was promptly decreased when the agonist was removed, the phosphorylation of MBS was unchanged in intact <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber.</b> The results suggest that MBS phosphorylation mediated regulation of MLCP is not suitable for regulating rapid change in myosin phosphorylation.

40|$|Background: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging is a noninvasive method of evaluating embryonic development. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, {{which is based}} on the measuring the directional diffusivity of water molecules, is an established method of evaluating tissue structure. Prolonged imaging times have precluded the use of embryonic diffusion tensor imaging due to motion artifact. Using temperature-based motion suppression, we aimed to investigate whether diffusion tensor imaging can be used to monitor embryonic smooth muscle development in ovo, and to determine the correlation between histologically-derived muscle fiber fraction, day of incubation and diffusion tensor imaging fractional anisotropy values and length of tracked fibers.

Increase in [Mg ~+] (0. 5 - 5. 0 mM) or decrease in pH (7. 3 - 6. 7) shifted the relation between pCa and the rate of CICR roughly in parallel toward the lower pCa.

Die Adhäsionsmoleküle ICAM- 1 und VCAM- 1 werden in der Literatur oft in diesem Zusammenhang genannt. Bei fortgeschrittener TVP wird durch die Adhäsion der Entzündungszellen ein Prozess beginnend mit Vasokonstriktion über Migration von glatten Muskelfaserzellen in das Endothel bis hin zur Thrombosierung des gesamten Gefäßes ausgelöst. Am Ende dieses Kaskade der endothelialen Aktivierung steht eine {{irreversible}} Schädigung des Endothels unterschiedlichen Ausmaßes bis hin zum kompletten Verschluss des Gefäßes.

Unter den Bedingungen einer Herztransplantation im Tiermodell (Ratte) konnten folgende Zusammenhänge beobachtet werden: - Es kommt nach erfolgreicher Herztransplantation zur vermehrten intimalen Expression von ICAM- 1 und VCAM- 1 im transplantierten Herzen. - Bei den mit alpha-Liponsäure behandelten Tieren konnte sowohl eine deutliche Verringerung der intimalen Proliferation, als auch eine Reduzierung der Inzidenz der TVP gezeigt werden. - Zusätzlich zu diesem morbostatischen Effekt auf die TVP konnte eine verminderte intimale Expression der Adhäsionsmoleküle ICAM- 1 und VCAM- 1 im transplantierten Herz nachgewiesen werden. Abschließend zeigt der in dieser Arbeit untersuchte Versuchsaufbau  unterstützt durch zahlreiche Publikationen  dass das Antioxidans alpha [...] Liponsäure indirekt oder direkt über eine Suppression von Adhäsionsmolekülen einen protektiven Effekt auf das Endothel des transplantierten Herzens hat. Die Ergebnisse dieser Studie untermauern die Schlüsselstellung von Adhäsionsmolekülen in der Pathogenese der TVP. Damit eröffnen sich ggf. auch für den Menschen weitere, dringend gesuchte Therapieoptionen zur medikamentösen Behandlung der TVP. Transplant vasculopathy (TVP) is {{the predominant}} cause of patient mortality following {{the first year}} after transplantation. A medicamentous treatment for avoiding and/or reducing TVP is not well known. The investigation and assessment of medicamentous treatment possibilities {{is the subject of this}} work. In literature, it is assumed that the emergence of TVP is initiated by attachment of inflammatory cells to the endothelium (adhesion) with the help of adhesion molecules. In this context, the adhesion molecules ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 are often mentioned in the literature. TVP advances as the adhesion of the inflammatory cells begin a process of endothelial activation starting with vasoconstriction, followed by migration of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fiber</b> cells into the endothelium and cumulating in thrombosis. Finally, this cascade of endothelial activation results in irreversible endothelium damage which can ultimately result in the complete occlusion of the vessel. The objective of this study is to reduce the expression of adhesion molecules ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 with medicamentous treatment of alpha-lipoic acid for a period of 120 days. The hypothesis is that the cascade of events causing TVP should be interrupted, and the incidence of TVP reduced. This assumption was tested using a model of cardiac transplantation in a rat, which led to the following key observations: - Successful cardiac transplantations result in an increased intimal expression of ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 in the cardiac transplants. - Animals treated with alphalipoic acid showed an obvious reduction of both the intimal proliferation and the incidence of TVP. - In addition to this decelerating effect on TVP in cardiac transplants, a decreased intimal expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 was also proven. Finally the experimental setup shows - supported by numerous publications - that the antioxidant alphalipoic acid directly or indirectly suppresses the adhesion molecules, thus creating a protective effect on the endothelium of the transplanted heart. The results of this study support the widely discussed key role of the adhesion molecules ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 in the pathogenesis of TVP. This work opens up new perspectives for urgently needed medicamentous therapy options in order to reduce the incidence of human TVP...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Pathophysiological {{mechanisms}} {{leading to}} chordee {{in patients with}} hypospadias and to the hidden state of buried penis in the prepubic fat remain unclear. Resection of dartos tissue usually makes the penis straight in patients with hypospadias and corrects it in those with buried penis, suggesting a common pathophysiology related to dartos tissue. Materials and Methods: Tissue samples from 113 children undergoing primary penile surgery for hypospadias (94 patients), epispadias (1) or buried penis (18) were collected between November 2011 and September 2013. Tissue samples from 79 children undergoing circumcision for nonmedical reasons served as controls. All samples were stained with <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> actin and analyzed by the same pathologist, who was blinded to indication for surgery. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were applied. Results: Three different dartos tissue patterns were observed. Pattern I (normal) consisted of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> of dartos tissue organized in a parallel configuration in the subcutaneous tissue. Pattern II was characterized by poorly developed and hypotrophic <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers.</b> Pattern III was determined by randomly distributed <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers</b> in the subcutaneous tissue, without parallel configuration. Pattern I was observed in 45 circumcision specimens (64 %). Of buried penis cases 78 % were considered abnormal (pattern II in 4 cases and III in 10, p = 0. 001). Of hypospadias cases 70 % were considered abnormal (pattern II in 31 cases, III in 32, and mixed II and III in 3, p < 0. 001). The only epispadias case was designated pattern II. Conclusions: Congenital penile pathology (hypospadias, buried penis) is associated with structural anomalies in dartos tissue.

40|$|Several {{characteristics}} of receptor capping in lymphocyte membranes suggest similarities with mechanisms underlying control of contraction in <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers.</b> Both capping and contraction are Ca 2 + dependent and require metabolic energy. Contractile proteins such as actin and myosin {{are associated with}} the cap, as is calmodulin, which mediates the Ca 2 + dependence of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> contraction. Recent studies have shown that myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which plays a central role in regulation of <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> contraction, is also present in isolated lymphocyte membrane-cytoskeleton complexes. We have explored this analogy further, using mouse lymphoma T cells whose membranes were rendered permeable to small proteins by using a low-Ca 2 + EGTA solution similar to that used to chemically skin <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> cells. Permeabilized lymphocytes were then exposed to solutions containing various combinations of high or low Ca 2 +, ATP, or other nucleotides (5 '-adenylyl imidodiphosphate, adenosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, guanosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, CTP, ITP, UTP, and GTP), calmodulin, Ca 2 +-insensitive MLCK (MLCK subunit that has been stripped of the Ca 2 + binding site), and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase that phosphorylates (and thereby inactivates) MLCK. Capping of concanavalin A-labeled receptors in these various test solutions was scored. In all solutions the capping observed in permeable lymphoma cells correlated well with contraction previously observed in similarly treated skinned <b>smooth</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>fibers,</b> providing strong evidence for the involvement of myosin light chain phosphorylation in the regulation of receptor capping...|$|R
