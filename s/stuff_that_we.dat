Silas decides to teach heavily pregnant Mercedes a lesson after she confesses to an affair with Riley's father, Carl Costello (Paul Opacic). Silas's plan is to keep Mercedes alive until she has given birth and then murder her. Metcalfe called the plot [...] "brilliant" [...] and said it was [...] "quite flattering" [...] to be trusted with it. The actress explained that Mercedes thinks that she is going to die whilst being help captive. Mercedes also fears that her baby is going to die. Metcalfe said that it does not take long for Mercedes to realise that Silas is responsible for the recent murders. Silas wants to keep the baby alive, but not Mercedes. Therefore, Silas does the [...] "bare minimum" [...] for Mercedes, giving her water, a small amount of food and keeping her warm. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy opined that storyline sounds [...] "really dark" [...] and asked Metcalfe whether Hollyoaks are pushing the boundaries with it.

Now, it's more that guitars are less of a player in the music, and it's more Imagine Dragons and Lorde and <b>stuff</b> like <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> don't fit the alternative category anymore. That was something that the record label wanted us quite desperately to try be a part of, and I think the producers steered us in that direction as well. It all makes sense, in some respect. They had a plan <b>that</b> <b>we</b> just weren't privy to. The whole point, for me, was to reclaim the fact that we're a rock band and it's what we'll always be, and until the alternative label shifts back to the kind of rock bands that have guitar and vocals, that's just what we'll be.|$|R

60|$|Let us {{now take}} a {{retrospective}} glance at the situation. The ship Nupple-duck, (Abersouth, master) had, it will be remembered, gone down with all on board except me. I had escaped on the ship Bonnyclabber (Troutbeck) which I had quitted owing to a misunderstanding with the chief officer, and was now unattached. That is how matters stood when, rising on an unusually high wave, and casting my eye {{in the direction of}} Tottenham Court Road--that is, backward along the course pursued by the Bonnyclabber and toward the spot at which the Nupple-duck had been swallowed up--I saw a quantity of what appeared to be wreckage. It turned out to be some of the <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had thrown overboard under a misapprehension. The several articles had been compiled and, so to speak, carefully edited. They were, in fact, lashed together, forming a raft. On a stool in the center of it--not, apparently navigating it, but rather with the subdued and dignified bearing of a passenger, sat Captain Abersouth, of the Nupple-duck, reading a novel.|$|E
60|$|The {{quantity}} of this dirty-looking <b>stuff,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> call the scum and the lees, goes on increasing {{until it reaches}} a certain amount, and then it stops; {{and by the time}} it stops, you find the liquid in which this matter has been formed has become altered in its quality. To begin with it was a mere sweetish substance, having the flavour of whatever might be the plant from which it was expressed, or having merely the taste and the absence of smell of a solution of sugar; but by the time that this change that I have been briefly describing to you is accomplished the liquid has become completely altered, it has acquired a peculiar smell, and, what is still more remarkable, it has gained the property of intoxicating the person who drinks it. Nothing can be more innocent than a solution of sugar; nothing can be less innocent, if taken in excess, as you all know, than those fermented matters which are produced from sugar. Well, again, if you notice that bubbling, or, as it were, seething of the liquid, which has accompanied the whole of this process, you will find that it is produced by the evolution of little bubbles of air-like substance out of the liquid; and I dare say you all know this air-like substance is not like common air; it is not a substance which a man can breathe with impunity. You often hear of accidents which take place in brewers' vats when men go in carelessly, and get suffocated there without knowing that there was anything evil awaiting them. And if you tried the experiment with this liquid I am telling of while it was fermenting, you would find that any small animal let down into the vessel would be similarly stifled; and you would discover that a light lowered down into it would go out. Well, then, lastly, if after this liquid has been thus altered you expose it to that process which is called distillation; that is to say, if you put it into a still, and collect the matters which are sent over, you obtain, when you first heat it, a clear transparent liquid, which, however, is something totally different from water; it is much lighter; it has a strong smell, and it has an acrid taste; and it possesses the same intoxicating power as the original liquid, but in a much more intense degree. If you put a light to it, it burns with a bright flame, and it is that substance which we know as spirits of wine.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Bread, however, relapsed {{again into}} troubled dumbness, and all Newman {{could do was}} to fold his arms and wait. But at last she {{appeared}} to have set her memories in order. [...] "It was when the late marquis {{was an old man}} and his eldest son had been two years married. It was when the time came on for marrying Mademoiselle Claire; that's the way they talk of it here, you know, sir. The marquis's health was bad; he was very much broken down. My lady had picked out M. de Cintre, for no good reason that I could see. But there are reasons, I very well know, that are beyond me, and you must be high in the world to understand them. Old M. de Cintre was very high, and my lady thought him almost as good as herself; that's saying a good deal. Mr. Urbain took sides with his mother, as he always did. The trouble, I believe, was that my lady would give very little money, and all the other gentlemen asked more. It was only M. de Cintre that was satisfied. The Lord willed it he should have that one soft spot; it was the only one he had. He may have been very grand in his birth, and he certainly was very grand in his bows and speeches; but that was all the grandeur he had. I think he was like what I have heard of comedians; not that I have ever seen one. But I know he painted his face. He might paint it all he would; he could never make me like it! The marquis couldn't abide him, and declared that sooner than take such a husband as that Mademoiselle Claire should take none at all. He and my lady had a great scene; it came even to our ears in the servants' hall. It was not their first quarrel, if the truth must be told. They were not a loving couple, but they didn't often come to words, because, I think, neither of them thought the other's doings worth the trouble. My lady had long ago got over her jealousy, and she had taken to indifference. In this, I must say, they were well matched. The marquis was very easy-going; he had a most gentlemanly temper. He got angry only once a year, but then it was very bad. He always took to bed directly afterwards. This time I speak of he took to bed as usual, but he never got up again. I'm afraid the poor gentleman was paying for his dissipation; isn't it true they mostly do, sir, when they get old? My lady and Mr. Urbain kept quiet, but I know my lady wrote letters to M. de Cintre. The marquis got worse and the doctors gave him up. My lady, she gave him up too, and if the truth must be told, she gave up gladly. When once {{he was out of the}} way she could do what she pleased with her daughter, and it was all arranged that my poor innocent child should be handed over to M. de Cintre. You don't know what Mademoiselle was in those days, sir; she was the sweetest young creature in France, and knew as little of what was going on around her as the lamb does of the butcher. I used to nurse the marquis, and I was always in his room. It was here at Fleurieres, in the autumn. We had a doctor from Paris, who came and stayed two or three weeks in the house. Then there came two others, and there was a consultation, and these two others, as I said, declared that the marquis couldn't be saved. After this they went off, pocketing their fees, but the other one stayed and did what he could. The marquis himself kept crying out that he wouldn't die, that he didn't want to die, that he would live and look after his daughter. Mademoiselle Claire and the viscount--that was Mr. Valentin, you know--were both in the house. The doctor was a clever man,--that I could see myself,--and I think he believed that the marquis might get well. We took good care of him, he and I, between us, and one day, when my lady had almost ordered her mourning, my patient suddenly began to mend. He got better and better, till the doctor said he was out of danger. What was killing him was the dreadful fits of pain in his stomach. But little by little they stopped, and the poor marquis began to make his jokes again. The doctor found something that gave him great comfort--some white <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> kept in a great bottle on the chimney-piece. I used to give it to the marquis through a glass tube; it always made him easier. Then the doctor went away, after telling me to keep on giving him the mixture whenever he was bad. After that there was a little doctor from Poitiers, who came every day. So we were alone in the house--my lady and her poor husband and their three children. Young Madame de Bellegarde had gone away, with her little girl, to her mothers. You know she is very lively, and her maid told me that she didn't like to be where people were dying." [...] Mrs. Bread paused a moment, and then she went on with the same quiet consistency. [...] "I think you have guessed, sir, that when the marquis began to turn my lady was disappointed." [...] And she paused again, bending upon Newman a face which seemed to grow whiter as the darkness settled down upon them.|$|E

After this tour and we're back home, we'll be able to work with producers <b>that</b> <b>we</b> want to work with and dial all the <b>stuff</b> in <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have - skeletons of songs. We have some really good <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> we're excited to work on for sure. One thing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> definitely don't want to do is take as long as it took for us to do 'American Tragedy' so there will definitely be a third record out next year and we're hoping for at the latest - summer." [...] He also explained that the album will sound more like Swan Songs did, in the lines of it having more party tracks than American Tragedy did.|$|R
