25|$|Recombination {{frequency}} is {{a measure}} of genetic linkage and is used {{in the creation of a}} genetic linkage map. Recombination frequency (θ) is the frequency with which a single chromosomal crossover will take place between two genes during meiosis. A centimorgan (cM) is a unit that describes a recombination frequency of 1%. In this way we can measure the genetic distance between two loci, based upon their recombination frequency. This is a good estimate of the real distance. <b>Double</b> <b>crossovers</b> would turn into no recombination. In this case we cannot tell if crossovers took place. If the loci we're analysing are very close (less than 7 cM) a <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> is very unlikely. When distances become higher, the likelihood of a <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> increases. As the likelihood of a <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> increases we systematically underestimate the genetic distance between two loci.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Double</b> <b>crossover</b> {{molecules}} are DNA structures containing two Holliday junctions {{connected by}} two double helical arms. There are {{several types of}} <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> molecules, differentiated by the relative orientations of their helix axes, parallel or antiparallel, and {{by the number of}} double helical half-turns (even or odd) between the two crossovers. They are found as intermediates in meiosis and they have been used extensively in structural DNA nanotechnology for the construction of one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays and in a DNA nanomechanical device. Whereas the parallel double helical molecules are usually not well behaved, we have focused on the antiparallel molecules; antiparallel molecules with an even number of half-turns between crossovers (termed DAE molecules) produce a reporter strand when ligated, facilitating their characterization in a ligation cyclization assay. Hence, we have estimated the flexibility of antiparallel DNA <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> molecules by means of ligation-closure experiments. We are able to show that these molecules are approximately twice as rigid as linear duplex DNA...|$|R

The segregation data were compared to a computer simulation that assumes trivalent pairing of homologues involved in exchanges, followed by nonpreferential segregation. Trivalent pairing was characterized by higher frequencies of exchange as compared to bivalent pairing, and {{by the presence of}} spores resulting from at least <b>double</b> <b>crossovers</b> involving all three homologues. Trivalent segregation was characterized by a unique recombinant class. The strong interference normally exhibited in diploid meiotic recombination was not evident from the frequency of <b>double</b> <b>crossovers</b> in these strains...|$|R

40|$|Regulation of {{both the}} number and the {{location}} of crossovers during meiosis is important for normal chromosome segregation. We used sequence-tagged site polymorphisms to examine the distribution of all crossovers on the X chromosome during oogenesis and on one autosome during both oogenesis and spermatogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. The X chromosome has essentially one crossover during oogenesis, with only three possible <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> exceptions among 220 recombinant X chromosomes. All three had one of the two crossovers in the same chromosomal interval, suggesting that crossovers in that interval do not cause interference. No other interval was associated with <b>double</b> <b>crossovers.</b> Very high interference was also found on an autosome during oogenesis, implying that each chromosome has only one crossover during oogenesis. During spermatogenesis, recombination on this autosome was reduced by approximately 30 % compared to oogenesis, but the relative distribution of the residual crossovers was only slightly different. In contrast to previous results with other autosomes, no <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> chromosomes were observed. Despite an increased frequency of nonrecombinant chromosomes, segregation of a nonrecombinant autosome during spermatogenesis appears to occur normally. This indicates that an achiasmate segregation system helps to ensure faithful disjunction of autosomes during spermatogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of {{systematic}} scan data from microsporocyte smear preparations suggests that cells with a crossover {{in a specific}} region tend to be geographically clustered to some extent within anthers.

Evidence for clustering within scans of cells {{of the first two}} classes is reported, but results are inconclusive for the third class. No evidence for within-scan correlation of frequencies of any two of the crossover classes was found. It is inferred that {{a large part of the}} variability in crossover frequency observed is probably due to factors which alter crossover interference. Implications related to the frequency and distribution of crossover sites are discussed...|$|R

A 1. 3 -kb BamHI fragment that hybridized to the Mycobacterium smegmatis rpsL gene was subcloned from an S. roseosporus cosmid library and sequenced.

40|$|The {{distribution}} within anthers {{of maize}} plants of microsporocytes of differing crossover class was studied by {{application of the}} serial-sectioning technique to plants heterozygous for a paracentric inversion. In such material, cells with four-strand <b>double</b> <b>crossovers</b> within the inversion are distinguishable from cells with other classes of crossovers within the inverted region and from cells with no crossovers within the inversion. Evidence was found for coarse clustering of cells with four-strand <b>double</b> <b>crossovers</b> within the inversion and for coarse clustering of cells of other crossover classes (with at least one crossover within the inversion). The local frequencies of these two major categories of crossover cells appeared to vary independently of each other, with regional increases in each occurring {{at the expense of}} noncrossover cells. There is also some suggestion that cells with four-strand doubles within the inversion may be clustered independently of other double-crossover classes within the inversion, but these other classes are not directly scorable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recently, we have {{invested}} {{a great deal}} of effort to construct molecular building blocks from unusual DNA motifs. DNA is an extremely favorable construction medium. The sticky-ended association of DNA molecules occurs with high specificity, and it results in the formation of B-DNA, whose structure is well known. The use of stable-branched DNA molecules permits one to make stick-figures. We have used this strategy to construct a covalently closed DNA molecule whose helix axes have the connectivity of a cube, and a second molecule, whose helix axes have the connectivity of a truncated octahedron. In addition to branching topology, DNA also yields control of linking topology, because double helical half-turns of B-DNA or Z-DNA can be equated, respectively, with negative or positive crossings in topological objects. Consequently, {{we have been able to}} use DNA to make trefoil knots of both signs and figure of 8 knots. By making RNA knots, we have discovered the existence of an RNA topoisomerase. DNA-based topological control has also led to the construction of Borromean rings, which could be used in DNA-based computing applications. The key feature previously lacking in DNA construction has been a rigid molecule. We have discovered that DNA <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> molecules can provide this capability. We have incorporated these components in DNA assemblies that use this rigidity to achieve control on the geometrical level, as well as on the topological level. Some of these involve <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> molecules, and others involve <b>double</b> <b>crossovers</b> associated with geometrical figures, such as triangles and deltahedra. 1...|$|R
