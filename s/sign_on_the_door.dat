Capacity crowds packed the theater during its opening {{week for the}} First National Pictures feature The <b>Sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Door</b> starring Norma Talmadge. [...] Other attractions included a 50-piece orchestra, famed organist Jesse Crawford at the 26-rank Wurlitzer theatre organ—"Oh, yes, it was mighty," [...] recalled Orson Welles— and a live stage show. [...] Poet Carl Sandburg, reporting for the Chicago Tribune, wrote that mounted police were required for crowd control. The theater's strategy of enticing movie patrons with a plush environment and top notch service (including the pioneering use of air conditioning) was emulated nationwide.|$|E
500|$|Jason Kaufman, a Harvard {{professor}} who teaches {{the sociology of}} culture, wrote that MOBA {{is part of a}} social trend he calls [...] "annoyism", where mass media venues promote performances and artists who mix the deliberately bad with the clever. The Museum of Bad Art happens to embody this trend, and further illustrates its central aim to mock the judgment system by which people identify what is bad from what is not. For Kaufman, [...] "The beauty of MOBA—though beauty is surely the wrong word—is the way it undermines aesthetic criteria from numerous angles." [...] Amy Levin, describing how American history and culture have been shaped by small local museums, suggests that MOBA is a parody of art itself, and that MOBA's commentary, newsletter, website, and publications mock museums as authorities on what is good art. The director of the Ellipse Arts Center, a gallery in Arlington, Virginia, that hosted a traveling exhibition of MOBA works, was astonished to see people's exuberant laughter because no one visiting the Ellipse had ever responded to art this way. She observed, [...] "If I didn't have a <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> people might not think it's so bad. Who's to say what's bad and what's good?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 1920s, Talmadge {{continued}} to triumph in {{films such as}} 1920's Yes or No, The Branded Woman, Passion Flower (1921), and The <b>Sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Door</b> (1921). The next year, she had [...] the most popular film of her entire career, Smilin' Through (1922) directed by Sidney Franklin. One of the greatest screen romances of the silent film era, it was remade twice, in 1932 with Norma Shearer, and in 1941 with Jeanette MacDonald.|$|E

2500|$|In response, Trevor Hicks, {{chairman}} of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, rejected MacKenzie's apology as [...] "too little, too late", calling him [...] "lowlife, clever lowlife, but lowlife".

Sales of The Sun remain poor in Merseyside and a boycott is still practised. In 2004, its average circulation in Liverpool was 12,000 copies a day.|$|E
2500|$|The Seventy-Niner's Café was a white-owned bar {{located on}} the {{southeast}} corner of E. 79th Street and Hough Avenue, and popular with African American residents of the community. Seventy-Niner's suffered from a number of problems, including drug dealing, the sale of stolen goods, and prostitution, and the owners had begun barring certain individuals from the establishment. Local prostitutes Margaret Sullivan and her friend, Louise (an African American), were among those who had been banned. Sullivan died on July 16, leaving three young children. On July 17, Louise attempted to leave a box at the bar so patrons could donate money for the care of Sullivan's children. The owners refused to permit the collection. Louise returned about 5 PM on Monday, July 18. The owners argued with her, allegedly using defamatory and racist language, and she was thrown out. A short while later, another racially charged incident occurred, although the exact details are unclear. In one account, one of the bar owners denied water to an African American man who had entered the bar, and then posted a <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> which read [...] "No Water for Niggers". In another account, an African American man purchased a bottle of liquor in the bar, and then requested a cup of ice. One of the owners denied his request, and then posted a <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> which read [...] "No water for niggers". In a third account, an African American man entered the bar and asked for a glass of water. One of the owners denied his request and told a waitress that there was [...] "no water for niggers". This co-owner then posted a <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> which read [...] "No Ice Water". In an interview with The Plain Dealer newspaper, the Feigenbaums denied being present at the bar during the incident, and denied that one of their employees had denied a man water.|$|E
2500|$|By then, he {{had turned}} his back on the {{portrait}} genre, including on his trademark canvasses of peasants and shepherds, and his art became semi-abstract. He was seen in modernist circles, and contributed to the 1934 exhibit Peisajul bucureștean ("The Landscape of Bucharest"), with paintings dating back to 1919. A year later, he had a retrospective show at Dalles, which ran parallel to the debut exhibit of Alexandru Ciucurencu. Zambaccian recalls that Sion felt jealousy toward Ciucurencu's fast rise. According to Zambaccian's own account: [...] "And since I was more preoccupied with Ciucurencu than Theodorescu Sion, he got upset and put up a <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of his exhibit: 'No Entry for Dogs and Zambaccian'. Of course the storm soon subsided. The painter's wife tore off the card, and Theodorescu Sion kissed me when we met again!" ...|$|E

There were several little tin signs nailed beside the entrance and Lory noticed that one of these read: [...] "Jason Jones. Studio. 3rd Floor." [...] It was an old sign, scarcely legible, while others beside it seemed bright and new, and when the girl had climbed laboriously up the three flights and the artist had unlocked the door at the head of the stairs, with a key which he took from his pocket, she found everything about the rooms she entered as old and faded as the <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
