40|$|Firms pay out cash {{using both}} {{dividends}} and <b>share</b> <b>repurchases.</b> In many aspects these two means are similar, but one important {{difference is that}} dividends are generally taxed more heavily than <b>share</b> <b>repurchases.</b> Nevertheless firms persist in paying out large amounts in dividends. This paper provides an explanation for this dividend puzzle by developing a class of signaling models violating the "single-crossing" property in which information {{about the quality of}} the firm is asymmetric between the management and the shareholders. In these models a high-quality firm can always signal its quality by using <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> only. However, in certain cases <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> become costlier on the margin for a high-quality firm than for a low-quality imitator. In such cases, the high-quality firm signals most cost efficiently by means of a combination of <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> and taxable cash dividends financed by the issuance of new shares. Taxable cash dividends financed by the issuance of new shares then can be considered a positive kind of money burning whose role is to signal a firm’s high quality. The implications of the models are consistent with several important empirical facts about dividends and <b>share</b> <b>repurchases.</b> Thus, this paper’s main contribution is to examine a range of new signaling models that provides a role for taxable cash dividends and <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> and to derive their empirical implications.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{question}} whether <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> {{are an integral part}} of US and UK firms’ financial decision-making, or whether they are merely an afterthought and therefore not systematically related to managers’ principal financial decisions, namely dividends, investment and leverage. It aims to address concerns that <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> might be detrimental to firms’ ability to create value through investment (FINNOV, 2012) and can lead to the excessive leverage of companies (Foroohar, 2013). As the US and the UK display differences in terms of the legal and institutional environment, the first two chapters focus in the US and the UK respectively. The US findings indicate that <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> are driven not merely by free cash flows, but also by decisions about investment and dividends, and both dividends and investments are in turn affected by <b>share</b> <b>repurchases.</b> The fact that these results hold both for the period before and subsequent to the credit crunch suggests that <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> have become an essential consideration when managers take financial decisions in large US firms. By contrast, the UK research fails to show a consistent interaction between <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> and investment. Moreover, the findings suggest that <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> are being used as a complementary form of payout and not as a substitute. Considering the differences in the results from the first and second empirical chapter, the question arises, whether these are due to differences in the sample characteristics, as the size of S&P 500 companies tends to much larger than that of FTSE All Share Index companies, or whether they reflect country-specific institutional differences. This question is explored in the third empirical chapter. This research supports the contention that national differences in terms of regulatory frameworks and the development of financial markets can affect corporate decision-making (e. g. Bennedsen and Nielsen 2010, La Porta et al. 2000). More specifically, country specific factors appear to lead to a lower use of <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> in the UK possibly due to the stricter regulatory framework. In addition, UK firms seem to try to maintain higher dividend payout ratios than their US counterparts, which can be attributed to a culture of high dividend payouts. These differences seem to explain the non-integration of <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> into UK firms’ financial decision-making. Therefore, without considering country specific factors, it is not feasible to generalise economist concerns that <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> can be detrimental to firms’ ability to create value through investment (FINNOV, 2012) and for leading to the excessive leverage of companies (Foroohar, 2011) ...|$|R

40|$|Net <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> have {{increased}} both {{in absolute terms}} and relative to cash dividends. <b>Share</b> <b>repurchases</b> during 1975 - 87 were predominantly fixed price tender offers and Dutch auctions, mainly signaling undervaluation. By 1994 open market repurchases (OMRs) represented over 95 % of repurchase activity. Event returns were 10 % to 15 % for the early period. OMRs during the 1980 s had initial event returns of about 3. 5 %, but had four-year buy-and- hold returns of 12 % and higher.

Econometric studies of the 1990 s are consistent with the hypothesis that a major motive was to offset the dilution effects of the exercise of stock options. Dividend patterns were related to permanent components of cash flow patterns while <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> were associated with more transitory cash flow changes. Dividend paying firms were almost two-third of publicly traded, non- financial, nonutility firms in 1978, but declined to 20. 8 % in 1999. Non-dividend paying firms were characterized by higher investment rates, higher R&D rates, higher market-to-book ratios, and relatively small size. Firms which began <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> in the 1990 s have similar characteristics. The use of stock options enabled these firms to make cash payouts based on the discounted values of optimistic expectations of future net cash flows and stimulated the use of <b>share</b> <b>repurchases</b> as documented.
