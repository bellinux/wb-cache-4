In 1855, Kentucky's voters passed by landslide a measure to raise the <b>school</b> <b>tax</b> from two cents per hundred dollars of taxable property to five cents per hundred dollars. The measure enjoyed the support of both Governor Powell and superintendent of public schools Robert Jefferson Breckinridge. Under the leadership of Powell and Breckinridge, Kentucky's school system became among the strongest in the antebellum South.|$|E

Based on recommendations specified by the Township Council, the Board of Education approved $544,391 in cuts. The school budget was rejected again in 2009, with the Council cutting $1 million from the $94.8 million originally proposed. After the 2010 school budget failed, the Township Council removed $6.1 million from the $95 million budget proposed by the school district, zeroing out {{what would have been}} an 8.2% increase in the <b>school</b> <b>tax</b> levy. The school board eliminated 77 positions to meet the cuts approved by the council.|$|E
5|$|D Charitable Foundation was {{established}} by Borislow in 1997 with a $21 million stock donation. In the first two years, he tried to use the charity to buy and preserve a tract of land in New Hope, Pennsylvania. This venture failed in 1998 when the property owner declined Borislow's offer. Following this, D made donations to the Clearwater Endoscopy Center and the Center for Digestive Healthcare in Clearwater, Florida until 2001. Since then, it has issued varied grants to causes Borislow supported, such as $2.75 million to two yeshivas and $173,450 to a West Palm Beach, Florida private <b>school.</b> <b>Tax</b> records indicate that Borislow and George Farley, {{the chief financial officer}} of the non-profit, split approximately $2.1 million in profits from 2001-2005, while $1.6 million went to charitable causes. Borislow drew criticism in 2007 when he paid himself $1.7 million through the charity.|$|E

5|$|During Willis's term, state revenue {{increased}} {{because of}} to wartime inflation, increased federal money, {{and the relative}} prosperity of the state's economy. The state budget was $31 million when Willis took office; {{by the time he}} left office, it had expanded to $52 million. Much of these funds were devoted to education. Expenditures per pupil nearly doubled, as did teacher salaries. The school year was lengthened from seven to eight months. Counties were also allowed to double their <b>school</b> <b>tax</b> rate. He created a Commission on Negro Affairs, appointed the first African-American to the state Board of Education, and increased state aid to pay out-of-state tuition to minorities who had been denied admission to professional programs in the state universities.|$|E
25|$|The school district's {{defenses}} {{were primarily}} procedural, in particular challenging whether federal courts had the jurisdiction over {{it in this}} case.

Robert Purvis refused to pay the local <b>school</b> <b>tax</b> in 1853, since his children would not be afforded an education in the schools.

25|$|The 1921 session saw {{a renewed}} {{struggle}} over public education. In the previous session, the far reaching, innovative legislation {{known as the}} “School Code of 1919” was enacted. This act completely reworked public education in Delaware by empowering a state superintendent to set standards, consolidated hundreds of tiny local school districts into countywide districts, established a 180-day school year, and provided for a County board of education to appropriate funding through the county property tax. It was hotly debated then, and only narrowly passed. The opponents were poised to repeal the whole legislation in 1921, but through much effort, proponents managed a compromise, the “School Law of 1921”. It lessened the standards, including the 180-day school year, but most importantly moved the funding from the counties to the state through an income tax. To manage that funding, it replaced the county boards of education with a State board of education and a State <b>School</b> <b>Tax</b> Commissioner. The whole effort was a personal mission of Pierre S. du Pont. He was prominent among those who persuasively argued its passage, {{not only in the}} General Assembly, but in hundreds of small gatherings around the state. And it was his personal $5,000,000 contribution, given over 20 years, which made possible much of the reconstruction of suitable buildings to meet the standards established.|$|E

500|$|The school {{legislation}} greatly {{fueled the}} borough craze in Bergen County.

[...] Allendale broke away, principally from Franklin Township, because of such fears. At 650 people, Allendale {{was one of the}} more populous boroughs formed in 1894. In such commuter communities as Park Ridge, those new residents often led the borough drives against the opposition of the old inhabitants who feared the improvements would not benefit them and that the new borough would quickly incur debt through issuance of municipal bonds.|$|E

500|$|Between the 1920s and 1960s, {{the city}} was known as an {{important}} industrial hub that featured the massive furnaces and foundries of such companies as Republic Steel and U.S. Steel. At the same time, Youngstown never became economically diversified, as did larger industrial cities such as Chicago, Pittsburgh, Akron, or Cleveland. Hence, when economic changes forced the closure of plants throughout the 1970s, {{the city was}} left with few substantial economic alternatives. The September 19, 1977, announcement of the closure of {{a large portion of}} Youngstown Sheet and Tube, an event still referred to as [...] "Black Monday", is widely regarded as the death knell of the old area steel industry in Youngstown. In the wake of the steel plant shutdowns, the community lost an estimated 40,000 manufacturing jobs, 400 satellite businesses, $414 million in personal income, and from 33 to 75 percent of the <b>school</b> <b>tax</b> revenues.

He advocated a special <b>school</b> <b>tax,</b> which he promised 'would be a blessing to the people...for it would...relieve them of the most intolerable of all burdens, the burdens of immorality and ignorance.

There were also changes to the Chance and Community Chest cards; for example, the [...] "poor tax" [...] and [...] "grand opera opening" [...] cards became [...] "speeding fine" [...] and [...] "it is your birthday", respectively; though their effects remained the same, and the player must pay only $50 instead of $150 for the <b>school</b> <b>tax.</b> In addition, a player now gets $50 instead of $45 for sale of stock, and the Advance to Illinois Avenue card now has the added text regarding a player collecting $200 if they pass Go on the way there.|$|E
