25|$|The PPP {{created the}} 1973 Constitution {{with the support}} of Islamists. The Constitution {{declared}} Pakistan an Islamic Republic and Islam as the state religion. It also stated that all laws would have to be brought into accordance with the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah and that no law repugnant to such injunctions could be enacted. The 1973 Constitution also created certain institutions such as the <b>Shariat</b> <b>Court</b> and the Council of Islamic Ideology to channel the interpretation and application of Islam.|$|E
2500|$|After Ali Bhutto was overthrown, landlords who {{had lost}} {{as a result of}} land reform appealed to [...] "Islamic Courts" [...] (i.e. the Shariah Appellate Bench and Federal <b>Shariat</b> <b>Court),</b> {{established}} by Bhutto's successor General Zia-ul-Haq, and these, rather than the executive or legislature of Pakistan, undid much of Ali Bhutto's reform program. According to scholar Charles H. Kennedy, the courts effectively [...] "suspended implementation" [...] of the land reforms, [...] "repealed the reforms, drafted new legislation, and then interpreted the new laws' meanings".|$|E
2500|$|This {{decision}} was reaffirmed by the Federal <b>Shariat</b> <b>Court</b> in 1981 (although the court acknowledged that [...] "Islam recognized {{the validity of}} state imposed limits on wealth {{for the purpose of}} alleviating poverty or providing for the public good", which was a goal of the land reform laws), and upheld by the Shariah Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court in 1986 in a 3 to 2 decision. This {{decision was}} [...] "clarified and reclarified" [...] in subsequent decisions, (but confusion over what land transfers were valid or not under the [...] "old law" [...] remained since legal proceedings with [...] "final decree" [...] prior to the August 1986 ruling remained valid).|$|E
40|$|In {{the light}} of the debates and discussions about giving rights to Muslim women and {{dispensing}} of quick justice according to Islamic provision, and the argument in favour or against the establishment and strengthening of <b>Shariat</b> <b>Courts</b> by AIMPLB, the main issue is how far the AIMPLB’s insistence on <b>Shariat</b> <b>Courts</b> is justified in a secular democratic state. Further, why do they want to deprive women of their citizenship rights? Why they are not taking initiative to make divorce laws in accordance with the Quran, despite women’s organization continuous demand for making personal law gender-just? This paper deals with the some of these issues. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{court system}} is {{organised}} as a hierarchy, with the Supreme Court at the apex, below which are High <b>Courts,</b> Federal <b>Shariat</b> <b>Courts</b> (one in each province {{and one in}} the federal capital), District Courts (one in each district), Judicial Magistrate Courts (in every town and city), Executive Magistrate Courts, and civil courts.

40|$|The main {{thrust of}} this paper is: Why should women go to these courts to settle matrimonial {{disputes}} while there are provisions for them in secular courts? Do women face less harassment and get quick justice according to Islamic law by approaching these courts? Who are the women who approach these courts? Should the mode of justice not it {{be left to the}} women to decide? Who would guarantee the efficacy of Darul Qazas, the quality of the presiding judges, the efficiency of the proceedings? Can the Board be allowed to take away the right of Indian Muslim women to knock on the doors of Indian courts? Does the Board have the authority to restrict Indian women’s access to the courts for justice? The paper is based on the experiences of 20 women who went to these courts for Khula, fask-e-nikah, and the settlement of maintenance, mehr, and the articles given at the time of marriage.

50|$|After taking {{power from}} Bhutto in a coup de'tat, General Zia-ul-Haq, {{who came from}} a {{religious}} background, committed himself to establishing an Islamic state and enforcing sharia law. Zia established separate <b>Shariat</b> judicial <b>courts</b> and court benches to judge legal cases using Islamic doctrine. Zia bolstered {{the influence of the}} ulama (Islamic clergy) and the Islamic parties. Zia-ul-Haq forged a strong alliance between the military and Deobandi institutions and even though most Barelvi ulama and only a few Deobandi scholars had supported Pakistan's creation, Islamic state politics came to be mostly in favour of Deobandi (and later Ahl-e-Hadith/Salafi) institutions instead of Barelvi. Sectarian tensions increased with Zia's anti-Shia policies.|$|R
