Moreover, the influence of different alkyl chain spacer between dications and combined anions on the retention behavior and selectivity of the dicationic ionic <b>liquids</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> under HILIC mode was displayed. The results indicated that the longer linkage chain would decrease the hydrophilicity and retention on the dicationic ionic <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase,</b> and while differently combined anions had no difference due to the exchangeability under the common HILIC mobile phase with buffer salt. Finally, the retention mechanism was investigated by evaluating the effect of chromatographic factors on retention, including the water content in the mobile phase, the mobile phase pH and buffer salt concentration.

40|$|International audienceCountercurrent {{chromatography}} (CCC) is {{a separation}} technique using a biphasic liquid system and centrifugal forces {{to maintain a}} support-free <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase.</b> Either {{one of the two}} phases can be the <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase.</b> It is even possible to switch the phase role during the separation. The dual-mode method is revisited recalling its theoretical background. The multi-dual mode (MDM) CCC method was introduced to enhance the resolution power of a CCC column. The theoretical study of the MDM method is validated by modeling the separation of two solutes. The basic hypothesis is that the forward step (partial classical elution) is followed by a backward step that returns the less retained solute to the column head.

40|$|International audienceA major {{challenge}} in countercurrent chromatography (CCC), the technique {{that works with}} a support-free biphasic liquid system, is to retain the <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> inside the CCC column (Sf parameter). Two solutions are commercially available: the hydrostatic CCC columns, also called centrifugal partition chromatographs (CPC), with disks of interconnected channels and rotary seals, and the hydrodynamic CCC columns with bobbins of coiled open tube and no rotary seals. It was demonstrated {{that the amount of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> retained by a coiled tube was higher with larger bore tubing than with small bore tubes. At constant column volume, small bore tubing will be longer producing more efficiency than larger bore tube that will better retain the <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase.</b> Since the resolution equation in CCC is depending on both column efficiency and stationary phase retention ratio, the influence of the tubing bore should be studied. This theoretical work showed that there is an optimum tubing bore size depending on solute partition coefficient and mobile phase flow rate. The interesting result of the theoretical study is that larger tubing bores allow for dramatically reduced experiment durations for all solutes: in reversed phase CCC (polar mobile phase), hydrophobic solutes are usually highly retained. These apolar solutes can be separated by the same coil at high flow rates and reduced Sf with similar retention times as polar solutes separated at smaller flow rates and much higher Sf...|$|R

Thick-film columns offer in addition a considerably increased sample capacity. The resolution of low-boiling compounds is enhanced and adsorption on the column wall is masked by the thicker film. Further, thick-film columns are less demanding with respect to instrument specifications such as speed of sampling, time constants and noise levels of detection and registration systems. The conclusion is that the best GC-MS interface appears to be no interface at all but rather direct insertion of the column end into the ion source...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} {{centrifugal}} microfluidics {{has evolved over}} the last several decades to allow implementation of complex biological and chemical assays on Lab-on-Disc (LOD) platforms. Present study describes the use of polymer polybutene for tuning hydrophobic siphons and for liquid volume definition on a centrifugal microfluidic platform. Both the siphon tuning and the volume definition steps are carried out by generating negative pressure that results from the volume expansion caused by the transfer of polybutene from a dedicated chamber into a secondary reservoir via a connecting siphon. The hydrophobic valve of the chamber that holds polybutene bursts open at specific angular velocities that depend on the height and density of the liquid column. Thus, the parameters of siphon activation can be adjusted by tuning the burst angular velocity of the valve that is driven by filling the tuning reservoir with a specific volume of polybutene. The same disc construction can be utilized to provide volume definition functionality to transfer liquids from one reservoir to another reservoir in as many fractions as there are immiscible liquids of different densities in the tuning chamber. The presented work also demonstrates the use of polybutene in sealing fluidic chambers to improve heating efficiency and to minimize evaporation during thermal cycling required for applications such as PCR amplification. Finally, the use of polybutene as a <b>stationary</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>phase</b> in droplet production on a spinning disc is demonstrated. &# 169; 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelbergclose 0...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{estimating}} any volatile anaesthetic in blood by means of gas chromato-graphy is described. It requires only a small sample which may be conveniently stored and from which many readings may be taken. Possible uses of the method are indicated. Gas chromatography offers a simple, cheap and reliable {{method of estimating}} any of the volatile anaesthetics in blood or tissues and is extremely sensitive. Measurement of clinical concentrations does not require such extreme sensitivity, but other features of the method present certain advantages. Thus sample size is small, and many estimations can be performed on each sample; storage is convenient and may be prolonged; other volatile substances in the blood, including other anaesthetics, acetones and alcohol, do not inter-fere with the analysis and may be estimated simultaneously if desired; repeatability is good and {{does not depend on}} a high standard of technical skill.

Thermobiochemical {{evidence}} for the rapid metabolic rate in hybridoma cells genetically engineered to overexpress the anti-apoptotic protein bcl- 2 in batch culture. Thermochimica Acta, 417,(2), 207 - 216. Sponsorship: BBSRC grant 2 /E 10985. A serious problem {{in the culture of}} animal cells to produce therapeutic proteins is apoptosis (programmed cell death) because it restricts the ability of the cell culture to yield the heterologous material. One means to delay apoptosis is genetically to engineer the anti-apoptotic gene bcl- 2 into the genome. This had been adopted elsewhere to give TB/C 3 hybridoma cells that overexpressed bcl- 2 (pEF bcl- 2 -MC 1 neopA plasmid) and a control, pEF, which contained a nonsense sequence (pEF-MC 1 neopA). In the spinner cultures used in the present investigation, bcl- 2 cells grew for 60 h to give greater cell density at a faster specific rate and with prolonged better viability than the controls in which, after 36 h, the membrane integrity and the apoptotic index of the cells declined rapidly leading to death. Prior to 36 h, production of the monoclonal antibody was only slightly higher in the pEF control giving little {{evidence for}} the metabolic burden of its production on antibody synthesis. Bcl- 2 synthesis, however, was associated with 125 % increase in heat flow rate (HFR) measured in the chemically (triacetin) calibrated batch microcalorimeter. HFR {{is a function of the}} metabolic rate and it is suggested that its greater level in the bcl- 2 cells than the control was caused by the increased protein production due to the bcl- 2 gene expression. The bcl- 2 cells had an increased lactate flux compared with the control. The calorimetric?respirometric (CR) ratio confirmed the likelihood that glycolysis rather than glutaminolysis was the primary reason for this increase. It may be due to the limitation in mitochondrial capacity and/or the paucity of biosynthetic precursors leading to production of them from glucose. The <b>stationary</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>phase</b> balance (SLPB) was shown to be the appropriate on-line method to measure the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) in the dilute cell suspensions grown in the tank bioreactor. The metabolic rate expressed as HFR was measured in a customised flow microcalorimeter, which had been calibrated using the enthalpy of hydrolysis produced by the new test reaction using methyl paraben. Both HFR and OUR declined before the decrease in cell density in batch culture, indicating that they were sensitive indicators of deteriorating environmental conditions. However, neither proved to be an early detector of the onset of apoptosis. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Thermochimica Acta, 380, (2), 229 - 244. Sponsorship: Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council for financial support in grants numbered 2 / 3680, 2 /TO 3789 and 2 /E 10985 The heat produced by animal cells in culture {{can be used as}} the primary indicator of the kinetics of their metabolism because the scalar flux of it {{is a function of the}} metabolic flux. The validity of the relationship between heat and metabolism was demonstrated theoretically through the concept of thermal advancement and in experiments by the use of continuous cultures. This validation permitted the {{application of}} heat flux as a probe of the metabolic state of cells in culture. It consisted of an on-line heat conduction microcalorimeter that measures the instantaneous heat flow and dividing the smoothed signal with one obtained simultaneously using a dielectric spectrometer that records the change in capacitance as an estimate of the amount of viable biomass. In this mini-review, it is shown with Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO 320) genetically engineered to produce interferon-? (IFN-?) that heat flux is an early signal of deteriorating metabolism in cultures that produce considerable amounts of toxic lactate under fully aerobic conditions. The early detection favours the use of heat flux as the control variable in fed-batch cultures. This is a particularly useful finding in the context of the pharmaceutical industry because it will help to ensure the high fidelity of the cytokines, antibodies and vaccines produced in large-scale cultures. The monotonic relationship between the fluxes for heat and metabolism means that the enthalpy balance method can be employed to test the validity of the growth reaction for cells in culture. This showed that the crucial ratio between the substrates, glucose and glutamine, in the culture medium was incorrect at 5. 5 : 1 instead of about 3 : 1, depending on the phase of the culture. Together with other changes to the medium composition, an improved formulation was made that ensured faster cell growth and greater specific rate (flux) of IFN-? constitutive secretion while decreasing glucose utilisation and, most importantly, halving the excretion of lactate, that is toxic to the cells and harmful to the fidelity of their secondary products. Indirect calorimetry (oxygen uptake rate, OUR) is often favoured over the direct technique, but the former only measures aerobic metabolism. The environmental conditions in cultures favours lactate production even under fully aerobic conditions. Developments in measuring OUR mean that the <b>stationary</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>phase</b> balance can be used successfully to make the calorimetric:respirometric (CR) ratio a valuable tool in optimising cell culture to grow cells that synthesise the maximum amounts of the high fidelity secondary products. Besides the value of heat flux in improving the cultures of animal cells producing heterologous products, three different techniques are examined that should be valuable in the testing the many compounds that are produced on a speculative basis as potential drugs. They are: (i) a thin-film thermopile transducer as an immunosensor; (ii) infra-red imaging of cells cultured in multi-well microtitre plates and (iii) integrated circuit (IC) calorimetry for small samples and low detection limit. One or more of these methods could well find favour with industry in the near future. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Lipophilicity of {{compounds}} with therapeutic interest {{represents one of}} the most important physicochemical parameters in predicting and interpreting transport processes across biological barriers. This property is commonly measured as a drug | membrane partitioning by its distribution in a biphasic system, such as a water | oil system. The lipophilicity is a key parameter used in a variety of fields that may predict absorption and other transport properties of drugs in the human body. For a long time, the understanding of the lipophilicity of ionisable and ionic drugs was limited by the lack of reliable experimental methods to estimate the partition coefficients. Recently the introduction of cyclic voltammetry has filled this gap, opening new perspectives for its use in drug design transfer through a mimic of a biological membrane. The aim of this thesis was to develop new systems for the study of pH-lipophilicity profiles of neutral and ionisable compounds and to illustrate the various contributions of those in order to extend the applications for drug studies. The existing electrochemical methodology has revealed a number of limitations, which calls for further development of existing procedures. In particular, it has proved difficulty to investigate the partitioning of highly hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds. Consequently, new systems with various phase ratios have been developed in order to extend the electrochemical measurements to medicinal chemistry. In the present work, two systems named "drop system" using a small aqueous phase and "liquid membrane system" using a small organic phase have been developed to study charge transfer reactions. The drop system is based on the simple deposition of an aqueous drop containing a redox couple onto the surface of a platinum electrode and immersed into an organic electrolyte solution. The electrode | water | oil interfaces are in "series". The voltammetric response depends on the coupling of the redox reactions on the solid electrode with the charge transfer reactions at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES), being either ion transfer (IT) or electron transfer (ET). This new drop system ensures a rapid equilibrium between the phases and has been used to study the lipophilic molecules. The liquid membrane system consists in a small organic phase either supported by a hydrophobic membrane or hold between two cellulose membranes placed between two aqueous phases, leading also to two interfaces in "series". The flowing of current across the liquid membrane is associated with two ion transfer reactions across the two polarised liquid | liquid interfaces in "series". This new methodology is described as a useful tool to study the transfer of highly hydrophilic ions, such as amino acids. Furthermore, a fundamental work on the miniaturization of liquid | liquid partition chromatography in a microchannel has been completed in order to offer a better understanding of the drug transport mechanisms. In the present work, a <b>stationary</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>phase</b> was immobilized in a microchannel using a porous polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The final goal is to develop a high-throughput method for logP measurements in microchips based on partition chromatography. A computer simulation was performed using a finite element method. The model is validated by comparison of the simulated data with both analytical and experimental data. Finally, transfer reactions across an adsorbed phospholipid monolayer (constituent of biological membrane) at the water | DCE interface were studied by quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS). This technique consists in measuring the interfacial tension at different potential step. The transfer of hydrophilic cations, like amino acids was found to be facilitated by the formation of a complex between the cation or proton with the phospholipid, followed by desorption of the phospholipid monolayer from the interface. The method allows to understand the drug interaction with biological membranes within the transport process across them and to access to the different association constants in the organic phase. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates how the analytical electrochemistry at liquid | liquid interfaces can be extended to evaluate the fundamental thermodynamic parameters of various ionic compounds. The systems used herein are examples of new ways to study the lipophilicity of drugs with applications in drug screening pharmaceutical research and development...|$|E

Retention times of trisaccharides containing only glucose were shortest when only (1 ( [...] - 3 Ìe) 3) bonds were present, and increased with increasing number of (1 ( [...] - 3 Ìe) 4) and especially (1 ( [...] - 3 Ìe) 6) bonds;In Section III a contribution {{to the understanding of the}} retention mechanism of carbohydrates was made by (1) measuring water concentrations in mobile and <b>stationary</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>phases</b> associated with amine-bonded and free silica surfaces, and by (2) relating retention of carbohydrates to two parameters, the number of hydroxyl groups per molecule that could hydrogen bond to amine groups on the surface and the calculated hydration number of the molecule;Section IV is a study of glucose reversion reactions catalyzed by the two major A. niger glucoamylase forms. Kinetics and equilibrium of the formation of five disaccharides and two trisaccharides were studied at three different levels of initial glucose concentration, pH, and temperature. A kinetic model based on adsorption of glucose and the seven oligosaccharides by the first three subsites of glucoamylase was formulated. Agreement of simulated and actual oligosaccharide formation data through the course of the reaction was excellent at all three temperatures and at the two lower initial glucose concentrations...|$|R
40|$|As {{separation}} of components {{is the major}} requirement of an analytical chemist, {{there is always a}} need for a convenient high throughput technique with minimum sample loss, high efficiency, high resolution, and ease of sample recovery, without contamination. This leads to the development of High Speed Counter Current Chromatography (HSCCC), in which the <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> is <b>liquid</b> instead of solid, and that provides a lot of advantages over other chromatographic techniques. In addition, advanced centrifugal partition technology is used to hold the <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> in the column, while the <b>liquid</b> mobile <b>phase</b> is pushed through it, which provides high yield and purity. This review highlights the major applications of HSCCC that include extraction of medicinal drugs from plants and purification and isolation of active material, plant analysis, {{separation of}} rare earth elements, preparative-scale separations of chiral compounds, analysis of inorganic compounds and elements, drug discovery, and drug development. Separation of dipeptides and proteins, flavonoids, alkaloids, DNP amino acids, indole auxins, and so on, proves the versatile and dynamic nature of the technique...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe European Space Agency's Rosetta {{mission was}} {{launched}} in March 2004 {{in order to reach}} comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by August 2014. The Cometary Sampling and Composition experiment (COSAC) onboard the Rosetta mission's lander "Philae" has been designed for the cometary in situ detection and quantification of organic molecules using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The GC unit of COSAC is equipped with eight capillary columns that will each provide a specific stationary phase for molecular separation. Three of these stationary phases can be used to chromatographically resolve enantiomers, as they are composed of liquid polymers of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to which chiral valine or cyclodextrin units are attached. Throughout the ten years of Rosetta's journey through space to reach comet 67 P, these <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> have been exposed to space vacuum, as the capillary columns within the COSAC unit were not sealed or filled with carrier gas. Long term exposures to space vacuum can cause damage to such <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> as key monomers, volatiles, and chiral selectors can be vaporized and lost in transit. We have therefore exposed identical spare units of COSAC's chiral stationary phases over eight years to vacuum conditions mimicking those experienced in space and we have now investigated their resolution capabilities towards different enantiomers both before and after exposure to space vacuum environments. We have observed that enantiomeric resolution capabilities of these chiral <b>liquid</b> enantioselective <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> has not been affected by exposure to space vacuum conditions. Thus we conclude that the three chiral stationary phases of the COSAC experiment onboard the Rosetta mission lander "Philae" can be considered to have maintained their resolution capacities throughout their journey prior to cometary landing in November 2014...|$|R
25|$|Gas {{chromatography}} {{is based}} on a partition equilibrium of analyte between a solid or viscous <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> (often a <b>liquid</b> silicone-based material) and a mobile gas (most often helium). The stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter (commonly 0.53 â 0.18mm inside diameter) glass or fused-silica tube (a capillary column) or a solid matrix inside a larger metal tube (a packed column). It is widely used in analytical chemistry; though the high temperatures used in GC make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins (heat denatures them), frequently encountered in biochemistry, it is well suited for use in the petrochemical, environmental monitoring and remediation, and industrial chemical fields. It is also used extensively in chemistry research.|$|R
50|$|The Llewellyn {{separator}} is a membrane molecular separator, {{a device}} for interfacing the effluence from a gas chromatograph to the ion source input {{of a mass}} spectrometer by changing a rather large (e.g. 10^4 TorrLitre) dilute (e.g. 1 part of vapour in 10^5 parts of carrier gas) gas flow into a small(e.g. <10^-3 TorrLitre) concentrated flow that can be admitted to the vacuum of the mass spectrometer. It is typically based on the substance passing through a few silicone rubber membranes in series. In order for the molecules of interest to be enriched {{in relation to the}} small and light carrier gas molecules the former must be captured by (dissolved in) the membrane polymer. The selection properties may be augmented by a <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> on the membrane.|$|R
40|$|Gamma {{radiation}} induced immobilization {{of several}} polydimethylsilane <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> {{for use in}} packed-column gas chromatographic separations has been studied. Extraction tests show that moderate doses of gamma radiation (80 - 140 kGy) are sufficient to produce significant (90 %) immobilization of most polydimethylsilanes onto Chromosorb supports, although a molecular mass effect is seen. Thermal stability also increases significantly with radiation dose, suggesting higher temperature use with smaller volatility losses. Infrared spectra confirm the continued presence of the stationary phase on the support after thermal stability tests and after exhaustive in-column washing. The column chromatographic behavior of the immobilized phases is equal to or better {{than that of the}} unirradiated phases, except for higher doses (300 kGy) of gamma-radiation. Columns prepared from gamma-immobilized polydimethylsilane have been used successfully in analyses where column contamination from high boiling materials requires frequent column recuperation...|$|R
40|$|Spillage {{of water}} polluting {{substances}} via industrial disaster may cause pollution to our environment. Thus, reversed-flow gas chromatography (RF-GC) technique, which applies flow perturbation gas chromatography, {{was used to}} investigate the evaporation and estimate the diffusion coefficients of liquid pollutants. Selected alcohols (99. 9 % purity) and its mixtures were used as samples. The evaporating <b>liquids</b> (<b>stationary</b> <b>phase)</b> were carried out by carrier gas-nitrogen, 99. 9 % purity (mobile phase) to the detector. The findings of this work showed the physicochemical measurements may {{vary depending on the}} composition of water and alcohol mixtures, temperature of the mixtures, as well as the types of alcohol used. This study implies that there is a variation in the results based on the concentration, types and temperature of the liquids that may contribute in the references for future {{research in the area of}} environmental pollution analysis...|$|R
5000|$|Gas {{chromatography}} is {{in principle}} similar to column chromatography (as {{well as other}} forms of chromatography, such as HPLC, TLC), but has several notable differences. First, the process of separating the compounds in a mixture is carried out between a <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> and a gas mobile phase, whereas in column chromatography the stationary phase is a solid and the mobile <b>phase</b> is a <b>liquid.</b> (Hence the full name of the procedure is [...] "Gas-liquid chromatography", referring to the mobile and stationary phases, respectively.) Second, the column through which the gas phase passes is located in an oven where {{the temperature of the}} gas can be controlled, whereas column chromatography (typically) has no such temperature control. Finally, the concentration of a compound in the gas phase is solely a function of the vapor pressure of the gas.|$|R
40|$|International audienceCounter-current {{chromatography}} (CCC) is a preparative separation technique {{working with}} the two <b>liquid</b> <b>phases</b> of a biphasic <b>liquid</b> system. One <b>phase</b> is used as the mobile phase when the other, the stationary phase, is {{held in place by}} centrifugal fields. Limonene is a biorenewable cycloterpene solvent coming from orange peel waste. It was evaluated as a possible substitute for heptane in CCC separations. The limonene/methanol/water and heptane/methanol/water phase diagrams are very similar at room temperature. The double bonds of the limonene molecule allows for possible Ï-Ï interactions with solutes rendering limonene slightly more polar than heptane giving small differences in solute partition coefficients in the two systems. The 24 % higher limonene density is a difference with heptane that has major consequences in CCC. The polar and apolar phases of the limonene/methanol/water 10 / 9 / 1 v/v have - 0. 025 g/cm(3) density difference (lower limonene phase) compared to + 0. 132 g/cm(3) with heptane (upper heptane phase). This precludes the use of this limonene system with hydrodynamic CCC columns that need significant density difference to retain a <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase.</b> It is an advantage with hydrostatic CCC columns because density difference is related to the working pressure drop: limonene allows one to work with high centrifugal fields and moderate pressure drop. Limonene has the capability to be a "green" alternative to petroleum-based solvents in CCC applications...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe preparative chromatographic {{technique}} called countercurrent chromatography (CCC) faces two major problems: first, {{to find the}} appropriate biphasic liquid system for the desired purification, and second, to retain enough <b>liquid</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> inside the CCC column so that the preparative separation can be achieved. In this study, a small-volume (38 mL) hydrostatic CCC column with rotary seals working at pressures as high as 70 bar and rotor rotation speeds as high as 3000 rpm was used to quickly estimate the separation properties of a given biphasic liquid system. The usefulness of this technique was demonstrated in the direct measurement of octanol-water partition coefficients. This approach {{can be used to}} purify milligram quantities of materials, but more importantly, the results obtained (solute partition coefficients) can be directly transposed to methods using larger CCC columns [...] both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic [...] for larger loads using the same biphasic liquid system...|$|R
40|$|Currently chromatographic methods using solid <b>stationary</b> and <b>liquid</b> mobile <b>phases</b> gain an {{increasing}} {{importance for the}} isolation and purification of pharmaceutical products, biomolecules and fine chemicals. Often required purity criteria can be met only if chromatographic techniques are applied, as e. g. {{in the field of}} enantio separation. The mentioned tendency is mainly favoured by the substantial progress achieved in producing selective and stable stationary phases. Further, from a process engineering point of view, there is now {{a better understanding of the}} development of concentration profiles in chromatographic columns under overloaded conditions available. This includes in particular the quantitative description of displacement and tag along effects caused by competitive adsorption. Besides, a series of alternative continuous and discontinuous chromatographic modes has been developed to improve yields and production rates. However, the studies performed hitherto are usually focused on the design and optimization of one of the available modes. In contrast, the objective of this paper is to compare the performance of four different modes of preparative chromatography on the basis of a uniform theoretical model...|$|R
