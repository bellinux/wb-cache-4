40|$|<b>Salmonella</b> enterica <b>serotype</b> Enteritidis is a {{major cause}} of nontyphoidal {{salmonellosis}} from ingestion of contaminated raw or undercooked shell eggs. Current techniques used to identify <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Enteritidis in eggs are extremely laborious and time-consuming. In this study, a novel eukaryotic cell culture system was combined with real-time PCR analysis to rapidly identify <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Enteritidis in raw shell eggs. The system was compared to the standard microbiological method of the International Organization for Standardization (Anonymous, Microbiology of food and animal feeding stuffs—horizontal method for the detection of Salmonella, 2002). The novel technique utilizes a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264. 7) as the host for the isolation and intracellular replication of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Enteritidis. Exposure of macrophages to <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Enteritidis-contaminated eggs results in uptake and intracellular replication of the bacterium, which can subsequently be detected by real-time PCR analysis of the DNA released after disruption of infected macrophages. Macrophage monolayers were exposed to eggs contaminated with various quantities of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Enteritidis. As few as 10 CFU/ml was detected in cell lysates from infected macrophages after 10 h by real-time PCR using primer and probe sets specific for DNA segments located on the <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Enteritidis genes sefA and orgC. <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Enteritidis could also be distinguished from other non-serogroup D <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> by using the sefA- and orgC-specific primer and probe sets.

To probe the evolution and ecology of this emerging serotype, we characterized 190 Salmonella isolates initially classified as <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> 4, 5, 12 :i:− (n = 90) and Typhimurium (n = 100) and obtained from various sources in the United States and Spain.

The majority of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> 4, 5, 12 :i:− and Typhimurium isolates (85 and 84 isolates, respectively) represented a single MLST type.

Public health officials have been increasingly looking toward whole genome sequencing (WGS) to provide a large set of data from which all the relevant information about an isolate can be mined. However, rigorous validation and careful consideration of potential implications in the replacement of traditional surveillance methodologies with WGS data analysis tools is needed. Two in silico tools for <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotyping</b> have been developed, the Salmonella in silico Typing Resource (SISTR) and SeqSero, while seven gene MLST for serovar prediction can be adapted for in silico analysis. All three analysis methods were assessed and compared to traditional serotyping techniques using a set of 813 verified clinical and laboratory isolates, including 492 Canadian clinical isolates and 321 isolates of human and non-human sources. Successful results were obtained for 94. 8, 88. 2, and 88. 3 % of the isolates tested using SISTR, SeqSero, and MLST, respectively, indicating all would be suitable for maintaining historical records, surveillance systems, and communication structures currently in place and {{the choice of the}} platform used will ultimately depend on the users need. Results also pointed to the need to reframe serotyping in the genomic era as a test to understand the genes that are carried by an isolate, one which is not necessarily congruent with what is antigenically expressed.

The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping method was used to assess the extent of genetic diversity and clonality of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden strains from humans and the environment. PFGE of XbaI-digested chromosomal DNA from 95 strains of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden gave 39 distinct profiles {{with a wide range of}} Dice coefficients (0. 27 to 1. 00), indicating that PFGE is very discriminative and that multiple clones of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Weltevreden exist among clinical and environmental isolates. Strains of one dominant pulsotype (pulsotype X 1 /X 2) appeared to be endemic in this region, as they were consistently recovered from humans with salmonellosis between 1996 and 2001 and from raw vegetables. In addition, the sharing of similar PFGE profiles among isolates from humans, vegetables, and beef provides indirect evidence of the possible transmission of salmonellosis from contaminated raw vegetables and meat to humans. Furthermore, the recurrence of PFGE profile X 21 among isolates found in samples of vegetables from one wet market indicated the persistence of this clone.

Hybridization analysis performed with 16 strains of Salmonella reference collection C and 22 strains of Salmonella reference collection B showed that all eight putative fimbrial operons of serotype Typhi were also present in a number of nontyphoidal <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes.</b> Thus, a simple correlation between host range and the presence of a single fimbrial operon seems at present unlikely.

This phase variation occurs by a novel epigenetic mechanism requiring OxyR in conjunction with the DNA methyltransferase Dam. OxyR is an activator or a repressor of the system depending on which of its two binding sites in the gtr regulatory region is occupied. Binding is decreased by methylation at Dam target sequences in either site, and this confers heritability of the expression state to the system. Most Salmonella gtr operons share the key regulatory elements that are identified here as essential for this epigenetic phase variation...|$|E

40|$|The stationary-phase-inducible sigma factor, σS (RpoS), is {{the master}} {{regulator}} of the general stress response in Salmonella and is required for virulence in mice. rpoS mutants can frequently be isolated from highly passaged laboratory strains of Salmonella.

We examined the abilities of these strains to produce the σS protein, to express RpoS-dependent catalase activity, and to resist to oxidative stress in the stationary phase of growth. We also carried out complementation experiments with a cloned wild-type rpoS gene. Our results showed that 15 of the 41 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhi isolates were defective in RpoS. We sequenced the rpoS allele of 12 strains. This led to identification of small insertions, deletions, and point mutations resulting in premature stop codons or affecting regions 1 and 2 of σS, showing that the rpoS mutations are not clonal. Thus, mutant rpoS alleles {{can be found in}} freshly isolated clinical strains of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhi, and they may affect virulence properties. Interestingly however, no rpoS mutants were found among the 75 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium isolates.

Using a Vitek GNI+ card for the identification of gram-negative organisms, we determined the biochemical kinetic reactions (28 biochemical tests) of 135 Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica strains of pig origin collected in Spain from 1997 to 2002 (59 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium strains, 25 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Typhimurium monophasic variant strains, 25 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Anatum strains, 12 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Tilburg strains, 7 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Virchow strains, 6 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Choleraesuis strains, and 1 <b>Salmonella</b> enterica <b>serotype</b> 4, 5, 12 :−:− strain). The results were expressed as the colorimetric and turbidimetric changes (in percent) and were used to enhance the classical biotype profile by adding kinetic categories. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed by using the enhanced profiles and resulted in 14 clusters. Six major clusters grouped 94 % of all isolates with a similarity of ≥ 95 % within any given cluster, and eight clusters contained a single isolate. The six major clusters grouped not only serotypes of the same type but also phenotypic serotype variations into individual clusters.

Laboratory investigations using phage typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) established that isolates of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> infantis from pig ear pet treats and humans exposed to pig ear pet treats comprised a well-defined subset of all isolates analysed. Of the 53 subtypes of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> infantis obtained {{around the time of}} the outbreak as defined by PFGE and phage typing, only 6 subtypes were associated with both human infection and isolation from pig ears.

An internal amplification positive control {{was included in the}} experiment to ensure the optimal functioning of the PCR and detect possible PCR inhibition. Three sets of primers were used for the amplification of the target sequences. The results were compared to those of the Kauffmann-White antigenic classification scheme. Results The assay was 100 % sensitive and specific, correctly identifying all 44 Salmonella strains, all 21 samples of S. Enteritidis and all 17 samples of S. Typhimurium tested in this work. Therefore, the entire experiment had specificity and sensitivity of 100 %. The detection limit was down to 10 copies of DNA target per 25 μl reaction.

40|$|Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar {{identification}} {{is of great}} importance with respect to outbreak monitoring and case verification. Therefore rapid, sensitive and cost efficient detection of Salmonella spp. is indispensable within microbiology labs. To amalgamate single tube isolate identification with Salmonella typing, we developed the high-throughput Universal Probe <b>Salmonella</b> <b>Serotyping</b> (UPSS) technique based on nano liter PCR. In comparison to the classical approach, where O- and H-antisera are applied, the UPSS relies on specific gene content amplification of Salmonella spp. by a universal TaqMan assay for all markers and identification of the specific amplicon pattern. To enable high-throughput technology we employed a chip format containing 1024 wells loaded by an automated liquid-handling system which allowed us to perform TaqMan PCR reactions in volumes of 100 nL per well.

Enteritidis determinations, generated an antigenic formula and/or a serovar designation consistent with the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor scheme for 87 % of unknown samples tested with the SGSA. Future experiments are planned to test the specificity of the array probes with other Salmonella serovars to demonstrate the versatility and utility of this array as a public health tool in the identification of Salmonella...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate serotype distribution, antimicrobial resistance patterns, carriage of class 1 integron, and clonality of Salmonella strains isolated from patients aged 0 - 12 years in Tehran, Iran, during 2007 - 2008. A total of 139 Salmonella isolates were studied. <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> Enteritidis, Infantis, and Typhimurium included 84. 9 % of isolates, Enteritidis accounting for 41. 7 %. The most prevalent resistances were to doxycycline (64. 7 %), nalidixic acid (61. 2 %), tetracycline (51. 8 %), and streptomycin (42. 8 %). Fifty-three (38. 1 %) isolates contained class 1 integron. Eight different gene cassettes were identified, aadA 1 being the most frequently encountered. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that integron-positive Salmonella strains belonging to serotypes Infantis, Enteritidis, and Typhimurium were attributed to two, three, and five different pulsotypes, respectively. The findings indicated that the distribution and drug resistance pattern of most prevalent <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> were broadly similar to that reported globally from human isolates. Presence of class 1 integrons was common among <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> in Tehran, Iran.

40|$|<b>Salmonella</b> enterica <b>serotype</b> Newport {{isolates}} {{resistant to}} at least nine antimicrobials (including extended-spectrum cephalosporins), known as serotype Newport MDR-AmpC isolates, have been rapidly emerging as pathogens in both animals and humans throughout the United States. Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is associated with clinical failures, including death, in patients with systemic infections. In this study, 87 <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Newport strains were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing and examined {{for the presence of}} class 1 integrons and blaCMY genes. Thirty-five PFGE patterns were observed with XbaI, and three of these patterns were indistinguishable among isolates from humans and animals. Fifty-three (60 %) <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Newport isolates were identified as serotype Newport MDR-AmpC, including 16 (53 %) of 30 human isolates, 27 (93 %) of 29 cattle isolates, 7 (70 %) of 10 swine isolates, and 3 (30 %) of 10 chicken isolates. However, 28 (32 %) <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Newport isolates were susceptible to all 16 antimicrobials tested. The blaCMY gene was present in all serotype Newport MDR-AmpC isolates. Furthermore, the plasmid-mediated blaCMY gene was transferable via conjugation to an Escherichia coli strain. The transconjugant showed the MDR-AmpC resistance profile. Thirty-five (40 %) of the isolates possessed class 1 integrons. Sequence analyses of the integrons showed that they contained aadA, which confers resistance to streptomycin, or aadA and dhfr, which confer resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. One integron from a swine isolate contained the sat- 1 gene, which encodes resistance to streptothricin, an antimicrobial agent that has never been approved for use in the United States. In conclusion, <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Newport MDR-AmpC was commonly identified among <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> Newport isolates recovered from humans and food animals. These findings support the possibility of transmission of this organism to humans through the food chain...|$|R

The objective {{of the study was}} to investigate the capacity of the NRLs for correctly identifying serovars of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica. Twenty serovars of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica selected by the CRL had to be examined by all NRLs according to their routine serotyping method. Thanks to the use of many frequently occurring serovars and the possibility of NRLs to send strains to another specialized laboratory, better results were obtained than for an earlier study. The incorrect detection of H antigens was the reason for most of the incorrect identifications. Het Communautair Referentie Laboratorium (CRL) voor Salmonella heeft een ringonderzoek voor de serotypering van Salmonella georganiseerd. De Nationale Referentie Laboratoria (NRLs) voor Salmonella uit 14 van de 15 lidstaten van de Europese Unie deden aan het onderzoek mee. Het doel was te onderzoeken of de NRLs serotypen van Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica correct konden identificeren. Twintig serotypen van Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica werden door het CRL geselecteerd. Deze moesten door de NRLs met de routinematig gebruikte serotyperingsmethode worden onderzocht. Door het gebruik van veel voorkomende serotypen en de mogelijkheid voor een NRL stammen door te sturen naar een ander gespecialiseerd laboratorium, werden betere resultaten verkregen vergeleken met een eerder ringonderzoek.

40|$|Background & Objective: Genus Salmonella {{has more}} than 2400 serotypes. The two major groups are S. enterica and S. bongori. Important serotypes are {{situated}} in S. enterica group. Antibiotic therapy in salmonellosis is restricted to typhoid fever and acute infections. After the first reporting of resistance in S. Typhimurium DT 104, nowadays, developing of resistance in Salmonella, specially, ESBL producing species {{is an important issue}} in salmonellosis. We evaluated serotyping, drug resistance and extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) in Salmonella enterica, collected from patients. Materials & Methods: We collected fecal samples in an 18 months period of time. Samples were cultured on selective, differential Medias. Serotyping was done with Biomérieux serotyping kit. After antibiogram, MIC was evaluated with E-test strips. By using ESBL disks in Double- Disk synergy method, ESBL phenotypes were distinguished. Results: We isolated 96 S. enterica serotypes, including: 35 Typhimurium, 22 Enteritidis, 11 Typhi, 8 Paratyphi B, 4 Newport, 3 Derby, 1 Virchow, 1 Infantis and 11 untypable serotypes. 36 isolates were sensitive to all of antibiotics, but, in 60 isolates, there were at least one resistance. In 45 isolates there were Multi Drug Resistance (MDR) phenotypes. Resistance to ampicilin was the highest percent, whereas, there was not any resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin. ESBL evaluation shown producing cefotaxime ESBL in 5 isolates and ceftazidim ESBL in 4 isolates. Conclusion: With furthermore epidemiologic studies on <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotyping</b> and antibiotic resistance, using suitable drugs in treatment, we can restrict the spreading of resistant Salmonella (specially, species with animal source) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Classical <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotyping</b> is an {{expensive}} and time consuming process that requires implementing a battery of O and H antisera to detect 2, 541 different Salmonella enterica serovars. For these reasons, we developed a rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based typing scheme to screen for the prevalent S. enterica serovars Enteritidis, Hadar, Heidelberg, and Typhimurium. Results By analyzing the nucleotide sequences of the genes for O-antigen biosynthesis including wb a operon and the central variable regions of the H 1 and H 2 flagellin genes in Salmonella, designated PCR primers for four multiplex PCR reactions were used to detect and differentiate Salmonella serogroups A/D 1, B, C 1, C 2, or E 1; H 1 antigen types i, g, m, r or z 10; and H 2 antigen complexes, I: 1, 2; 1, 5; 1, 6; 1, 7 or II: e,n,x; e,n,z 15. Through the detection of these antigen gene allele combinations, {{we were able to}} distinguish among S. enterica serovars Enteritidis, Hadar, Heidelberg, and Typhimurium. The assays were useful in identifying Salmonella with O and H antigen gene alleles representing 43 distinct serovars. While the H 2 multiplex could discriminate between unrelated H 2 antigens, the PCR could not discern differences within the antigen complexes, 1, 2; 1, 5; 1, 6; 1, 7 or e,n,x; e,n,z 15, requiring a final confirmatory PCR test in the final serovar reporting of S. enterica. Conclusion Multiplex PCR assays for detecting specific O and H antigen gene alleles can be a rapid and cost-effective alternative approach to classical serotyping for presumptive identification of S. enterica serovars Enteritidis, Hadar, Heidelberg, and Typhimurium. </p...|$|E

40|$|Three {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the use of molecular techniques to identify <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> in poultry. In the first experiment, two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based techniques: {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) were used to analyze <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotype</b> isolates from two turkey processing plants (A and B). Genotypic patterns of each isolate were compared with those of known serotypes identified by traditional antibody precipitation methods. In Plant A, four different <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> were identified: Derby, Hadar, Montevideo, and Senftenberg. In plant B, ten serotypes were identified: Agona, Anatum, Brandenburg, Derby, Hadar, Meleagridis, Montevideo, Reading, Senftenberg, and Typhimurium. S. Derby was predominant in Plant A (83 %) while S. Typhimurium was the most common serotype recovered in Plant B (39 %). Overall, DGGE was more sensitive than PAGE. Isolates of the same serotypes were all grouped together by DGGE, while PAGE failed to group all like serotypes. Next, DGGE and REP-PCR were used as genotyping tools for identifying Salmonella. Fifty-four Salmonella isolates from two turkey processing plants (A and B) were evaluated. The isolates were comprised of the following serotypes: Brandenburg, Derby, Hadar, and Typhimurium (n = 6, 21, 12, and 15, respectively). Both methods were very sensitive and detected diverse fingerprint profiles among the isolates. The data suggested that REP-PCR and DGGE are useful tools for identifying <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> in research trials of this type. The final trial was carried out to track <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> throughout an integrated poultry operation using DGGE. Four flocks were sampled from grow-out through processing. The data showed that there was correlation between <b>Salmonella</b> <b>serotypes</b> found on processed carcasses and during grow-out. In addition, the isolates were compared against 15 known serotypes in our data base and only S. Hadar from the data base matched the unknown Salmonella isolates. Overall, these studies demonstrate that PCR-based methods could be considered as an alternative to conventional methods of antibody-based serotyping. Molecular methods were found to be reliable, sensitive, inexpensive, reproducible, and less labor intensive than conventional methods...|$|R
