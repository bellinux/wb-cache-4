40|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, medical information has rapidly been changed into electronic form. Such a trend brought in another radical change of purchasing pattern of medical libraries and the access pattern of the users. Within {{the last four or five}} years, many medical libraries have changed their purchasing pattern from printed to electronic form. More users are beginning to depend on websites. While this phenomenon caused the librarians to reexamine their traditional duties, an abundance of unattested information were heaped on the users. Medical librarians decided to make the information to be more user-friendly. By this we mean, whenever the user desires to find any medical information, he/she would call to the librarian rather the library.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century, the Chinese television industry has witnessed the rise of a new form of television programme, Chinese Women’s Makeover Shows. These programmes have quickly become a great success and have received enormous attention from growing audiences. The shows are themed on educating and demonstrating to the audiences the information and methods needed to beautify their faces and bodies and consume products accordingly. The shows are different from earlier Chinese fashion television programmes in format, and are also different from western makeover shows that have personal transformations of external appearance as their subject. The importance of adopting these shows as a research topic {{lies in the fact that}} the shows not only represent the images of contemporary Chinese women and propose a series of standards that a modern Chinese woman is advised to abide by in terms of body presentation and appearance, but also reflect the characteristics of Chinese female consumers and the rising consumer culture of China in general. It concerns the challenges and anxieties that have been brought to every woman in China. The thesis starts with an overview analysis of this flourishing genre of television programme and outlines its <b>status</b> quo, <b>format</b> and production techniques. In the following three chapters, it takes three years (2010 - 2012) of episodes of the three most popular Chinese Women’s Makeover Shows, Queen, Pretty Women, and I am a Great Beauty as the main samples for analysis, aiming to scrutinise 1) the idealised femininity represented in the shows and the cultural context from which the features derive; 2) the self-presentation promoted as appropriate in the shows and how it relates to the reality of Chinese women’s daily life; 3) the body maintenance that the shows urge upon their audiences as regards consumption for the female body and to what extent this epitomises and functions in constructing a consumer society with Chinese characteristics. The thesis intends to fill a gap in academic research with a systematic analysis of the prevailing phenomenon of the Chinese Women’s Makeover Shows and an in-depth study concerning the shows’ meaning-making process within their cultural context...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{tries to}} comment {{on some of the}} {{standardisation}} efforts in the area of exchange formats for lexical resources. The first family of standards was centred around terminological data, producing exchange formats like MATER/ MARTIF and TBX, based on an organisation of the data as concepts and (language-specific) terms. When the exchange of fully annotated lexical data came into play, standards like OLIF and MILE were proposed; they focus on the representation and the exchange of (mono- and multilingual) dictionary entries and their attributes (Thurmair/Lieske 2002). Recent developments are organised around the creation of markup frameworks, try to define frameworks for meta-models on one hand, and sets of elementary data categories on the other hand, both of which can be grouped into workable exchange formats. 1 TBX 1. 1 History The first exchange format for terminology was called MATER; it defined how data had to be stored on a magnetic tape, specifying, among other things, byte sequence, tape length, block size etc. This format was converted into Micro-Mater (for PC exchange), and later into MAR-TIF, the first SGML-based format. Martif underwent several standardisation steps (ISO 12200, ISO 12620 and others) and was further developed in an EU funded project called SALT.

40|$|International audienceIn this presentation, we analyse the {{construction}} of cancer patient profiles through websites offering information on the disease. We characterize the profiles of cancer patients as they appear on {{a large number of}} French websites. Many sites belong to non-profit organizations; others are initiatives by the medical profession; others still are produced by professional organizations linked to the media sphere. Apart from a general review of the competencies and rights associated with patients, on the role of information in determining their capacities to act, and on the place granted to patients and their families to express themselves, the sites related to patient organizations raise specific questions. For instance, what are the forms of engagement pertaining to cancer, in the French non-profit organization movement? In particular, how can the division of tasks that each organization institutes between doctors, patients and itself be characterized, and how does it articulate its support activities with its activism? In parallel, we examine the role of the Internet in shaping this engagement, and the forms of writing peculiar to the Web. This writing has the characteristic of affording the possibility of a multiplication of enunciators and thus of facilitating encounters and the formation of collectives, that is, individuals talking in the same voice with specific aims. In what way do the uses to which the various "authors" of websites put these possibilities allow for the creation of new knowledge, the emergence of new collectives, and the performation of new actor configurations? To answer these questions, our presentation is divided into three parts: - First, we consider the <b>status</b> and <b>format</b> of medical information, as delivered on websites. In particular, we examine the designated enunciators, the authority on which their information is based, and the mise en scène of the context of enunciation. What position is assigned to the recipients of this information? Is there space for uncertainty and debate? - In the second part we characterize the presence of laypersons' and patients' talk. In particular, we examine its possible link with that of professionals, and that of "science". Are there any forms of articulation between individual experiences and collective forms of expression? - Finally, in the third part, we analyse the patient profiles that each website constructs in its public, both through the proposed content and through the modalities of action afforded by the site itself. We consider the "patients", their possibilities to act and the competencies attributed to them. How does the site describe a patient's relations with healthcare professionals? What choices does the patient have? What leeway does he or she have to define him- or herself through the site itself? What are the relations between the patient profile, that of the activist and that of the donor of funds...|$|R

This research explored display design to enhance situation awareness (SA) while conducting navigation with spatial and temporal constraints (space-time navigation). For Experiment 1, static maps were developed for space-time navigation including scheduled/estimated time of arrival for passengers at bus stops on public bus routes. The maps varied time <b>status</b> representation and <b>format</b> of indicated time into four conditions. To examine SA, the test program provided 23 non-pilot participants with the maps and different questions asking about the spatial and/or temporal statuses. Participants answered questions faster and more accurately when the time formats of question and map were compatible. Also, time length format was as effective as exact time format, and the text + graphics maps showed a benefit. For Experiment 2, flight deck displays composed of a navigation display (ND) and a control display unit (CDU) were developed varying display proximity between space and time information. Compared with the traditional standard pilot displays, display proximity manipulation included adding required/estimated time of arrival text on the ND, adding temporal conformance graphic bars on the CDU, and integrating all temporal texts and conformance graphics on the ND. Fifteen pilots participated in queries about the spatial and/or temporal status to evaluate their SA during autopilot simulation in four display conditions. The increased display proximity conditions were as good or better with respect to pilot speed and accuracy and subjectively were perceived less difficult to answer compared with the traditional condition. In Experiment 3, 14 pilots flew a simulated flight, and their compliance of spatial and temporal requirements at scheduled waypoints was measured in the four display proximity conditions. Pilots 2 ̆ 7 mental workload was subjectively perceived lower with novel display conditions.

40|$|In {{response}} to the growing demand for a test of cognitive ability for South African adults, the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) adapted the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales, third edition (WAIS-III) for English-speaking South Africans. However, {{since the publication of}} the South African adaptation in 2001, there has been some concern whether some bias may not still be present in the measure. Consequently, this study aimed to qualitatively explore the item content of the South African adaptation of the WAIS-III in order to identify items that might still be potentially biased with specific reference to cultural and linguistic issues. The researcher employed purposive sampling, a non-probability technique, to select psychology professionals to act as expert reviewers. The sample consisted of 20 registered psychologists, psychology lecturers and psychology interns from the predominant culture and language groups of the Eastern and Western Cape. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected by means of a Bias Review Questionnaire which consisted of fixed-choice questions, as well as sections in which specific comments could be indicated. The questionnaire was distributed to 20 selected participants who were qualified to administer psychometric measures and were registered with the Health Professionals Council of South Africa (HPCSA). Qualitative data was analysed using Tesch’s model of thematic content analysis, and five main themes relating to potential bias were identified, namely: Culture, Language, Education, Socio-economic <b>status,</b> and <b>Format.</b> The qualitative data was re-submitted to the expert review group for approval and further comment. Quantitative data obtained from the Bias Review Questionnaire was analysed by obtaining frequency counts, which were converted to percentages, per subtest and aspect reviewed. The major findings of the study were as follows: 1. Cultural bias is evident in the South African adaptation of the WAIS-III. The differential meanings ascribed to concepts, terms, phrases and words by diverse cultures impact on test performance, as does familiarity with stimulus materials used in the measure. 2. Language bias was detected against groups with English as their second or third language owing to the unfamiliar, and sometimes archaic, terms and vocabulary used in the measure. The intended meanings of the translated items are unclear and confusing for test-takers. 3. South African test-takers have experienced vastly divergent educational opportunities which impact on intelligence test performance. The measure contains potential bias against individuals from disadvantaged educational backgrounds. 4. The content of the items is not relevant to test-takers from deprived socioeconomic backgrounds that have been unable to access good-quality education. 5. Format bias was found to exist with respect to the timed tests. Cultural groups who do not value speededness are disadvantaged by the structure and format of the measure. Based on the findings of this study, certain recommendations were made. These include: 1. Additional qualitative investigation of the WAIS-III, with a view to further adaptation in an effort to eradicate bias on cultural or linguistic grounds, and 2. Conducting further Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analyses and establishing construct equivalence across cultural and linguistic groups to promote this objective. Among the contributions believed to have been made by this study are the identification of potentially biased subtests and items on the grounds of culture and language, which will facilitate possible further revision and adaptation of the measure.

Design objectives for the information management elements of the system included the need to manage the vast quantities of data that eradication procedures for an epidemic {{would be expected to}} generate within a very short time; the ability to apply current epidemiological understanding of disease spread to the data processing tasks; to reduce some of the foreseen processing bottlenecks; and to provide decision support to the data entry personnel. Design objectives for the veterinary management elements of the system included the presentation of up-todate <b>status</b> reports in <b>formats</b> that facilitate national decision-making; the ability to optimize manpower resource allocation; and the capacity to evaluate the relative merits of alternative technical decisions, each of which carried different implicit risks. The system combines a database management system (DBMS), a geographic information system (GIS), expert system elements, various models of specific aspects of FMD epidemiology, and a statistical analysis capability. EpiMAN comprises tightly coupled spatial and textual databases. Farm locations and other geographical information are managed by the GIS, while the textual component incorporating farm profile information and epidemic data is manipulated by the DBMS. The models of spread of FMD and the expert systems jointly provide the epidemiological knowledge components. The models are linked to the databases to help quantify the risks of FMD spread and allow the evaluation of management options, based on the current situation. The expert systems advise various operational sections of the emergency headquarters (EHQ) on priorities for control activities. The analytical system (termed the epidemiologist's workbench) is an integrated suite of tools which allows the state of the epidemic to be examined and control options to be evaluated. The system has been designed as a transportable system to operate wherever the EHQ is set up. It is implemented as a multi-user system, with the database server and the GIS each residing on a UNIX workstation, with IBM-compatible PCs used as terminals. Communications links to MAF's computer network are provided for. It is hoped the system will never need to be used for a FMD emergency in New Zealand. However the system can be easily adapted for use in other countries, and the methodology is also being extended to other disease syndromes. A number of studies were conducted to assess the risk of FMD entry into New Zealand, and examine the potential for disease spread through normal farm movement patterns. The best current estimate of the risk of an FMD outbreak is about once in 50 years (0. 0199). The mean expected number of FMD infected secondary properties under MAF's exotic diseases and pests responses programme is 61 (median 33, range 1 to 1103). In order to contain 95 % of the movements that might occur off an index farm prior to diagnosis, an infected area would have to have a radius of 100 km around the property. A cost benefit analysis supported the development of EpiMAN...|$|R
40|$|Objective - This paper aims at {{describing}} performative class action, emergent tourist {{imagination and}} reconceptualization of crime (Thurlow & Jaworski 2014, Ferrell 2013) in videos by {{and about the}} anti-racketeering Addiopizzo travel tourism movement in Sicily. These videoreportages show traditional touristic urban or rural sites under new angles, moving away from a traditional Grand Tour conception of the Sicilian countryside and monumental highlights, towards coverage about community based tourism entreprises against the madia, such as B&B accommodation or cooperatives producing ethical products, in other, less monumental settings such as confiscated mafia property transformed positively in social projects for bio-agriculture {{as well as in}} in Palermo’s popular shops refusing to pay protection money. Framework - This presentation analyzes the multimodal discourse about Addiopizzo travel as a linguistic window into social innovation (Heller et al. 2014, Cappelli 2013) : both with respect to the genre of the touristic videoreportage about Sicily and through the co-construction of alternative framings of mafia in Sicilian society (Gilliam & Iyengar 2005, Hillahan 2011). The framework is multimodal critical discourse analysis, which studies meaning-making through the combination of linguistic and visual resources in video documentaries (Kress 2010, Jewitt 2013, Bateman & Wildfeuer 2014, Wildfeuer 2014, Hiipala 2016). Context - Addiopizzo arose as a grassroots movement by entrepreneurs refusing to pay extortion money, opposing to the traditional resilience by the Sicilian population fatalistically undergoing intimidation and omertà imposed by Cosa Nostra, another view: the marginalization of Mafia, the emergence of a local responsible economy as a form of public resistance and collective cultural revolution against organized crime (Forno and Gunnarson 2010, Forno 2015, Rubdi & Ben Said 2015). Recently, the movement started acting as a travel organization, extending its focus to consumer strategy in responsible tourism, by means of study trips for schools or informative and leisure excursions for other interested travelers worldwide. The goal of this organization is to show how civil society can oppose organized crime successfully and bring antimafia experience to local and national or global touristic audiences moving beyond proletarian class struggle and involving interclass and transnational contestation and resistance to the mafia (Santino 2008, Rubdy & Ben Said 2015). Corpus and methodology – Our corpus consists of 10 Italian and English travel reportages on YouTube displaying the Addiopizzo travel movement, posted between 2014 and 2017 : the items reach from the group’s own promotion videos to Italian regional or national TV news coverage on regional activist channels or Italy’s national RAI to short European documentaries on British or American TV, and even independent amateur videos by customers (Dunn 2005 a, 2005 b; Francesconi 2015 a, 2015 b). The method used is a functionally oriented corpus-based multimodal analysis (O’Halloran 2008, Bednarek 2015). A central hypothesis is that videodiscourse multimodally displays social relations and tensions between mafia and non-mafia actors and reflects social change performed by antimafia organizations across speech and visual elements in discourse about the mafia and Sicily (Iedema 2003, Di Ronco & Lavorgna 2016). (Expected) results – We provide a classification for the following three discursive strategies used by Addiopizzo Travel in Italian and English. (i) 	We examine genre variation (Francesconi 2014) in the antimafia tourism video reportages defined in terms of their pre-/on-/post-trip travel <b>status,</b> their <b>format,</b> such as TV news coverage, interviews, videoblogs (Azariah 2016) and the like, as well as the institutional source of the video production (the Addiopizzo travel organization itself or traditional national and regional public, private or alternative television stations, as well as individual vlogs). (ii) 	We describe patterns of mediated action remediated interaction, and, possibly co-construction between two types of social actors: Addiopizzo hosts (entrepreneurs and the organization’s representatives) and tourists (Italian and foreign, represented directly (i. e. as they interact during activities or multimodally perform actions) or indirectly (as they are spoken about and mentioned in absence) (Van Leeuwen 1996, Author, Thurlow & Jaworski 2014, Pappalepore & Smith 2016, Forno & Garibaldi 2016). We zoom in on the social movements’s represented actions involving such actors: these are no longer restricted to the mere display of public protest and/or information in a climate of failing direct legal or law enforcement nor as a classical working-class or rural social struggle against mafia hegemony (Santino 2008). In the corpus, they present themselves, instead, as active players in changing their local socio-economic tissue, as they replace traditional schemas of exploitation by new, sustainable educational and economic activities which involve in their activism heterogeneous other interclass civil actors as well as transregional and transnational connections with their hosts in the joint process of production and consumption of the touristic community-based experience. Local activists-hosts and their Italian or foreign clients take part in shared indirect antimafia experiences and preventive activities which eventually lead to co-construction of the touristic destination. (iii) 	We provide an overview of Addiopizzo’s legitimation and justification strategies and framings of social change, as a reversible destiny for the city and its citizens (Schneider & Schneider 2003), which reshuffles more conventional, sometimes fatalistic, romantic and fictional representations of mafia culture, and even straightforward denial of the Mafia’s existence (Jerne 2015, 2016; Di Piazza 2010; Poppi & Di Piazza 2017). Such discursive strategies show clients as they interact with local activists and react to mafia stereotypes during their stay in Italy.   References Azariah, Deepti Ruth (2016).
