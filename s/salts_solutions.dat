The present work is a thorough study on the formation of nickel metal nanoparticles (NPs) during the pyrolysis of nickel(II) impregnated wood in the temperature range of 400 - 500 °C. During the wood impregnation step, the numerous oxygenated groups present in the bio-macromolecules act as adsorption sites for metal cations in aqueous medium yielding very high metal precursor dispersion into the wood matrix. During pyrolysis, an amorphous NixOyHz phase is formed which is reduced to metallic nickel (Ni 0) by carbon atoms at temperatures below 500 °C, leading {{to the formation of}} Ni 0 NPs, as demonstrated by XRD, XPS, STEM and temperature-programmed pyrolysis characterizations.
