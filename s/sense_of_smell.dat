5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves {{relative to their}} brain size, the organs responsible for a heightened <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell.</b> This suggests that the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E
5|$|The {{olfactory}} nerve (I) conveys the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell.</b>|$|E
5|$|Olfactory lobes {{are absent}} in river dolphins, {{suggesting}} {{that they have no}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell.</b>|$|E

50|$|Bugbears have {{exceptional}} <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> {{sight and}} hearing, {{able to see}} in pitch darkness. They move with amazing stealth.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{entry into}} a room {{provides}} the most accurate <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> before habituation begins to change perception of odor.|$|R
5|$|The kakapo has a {{well-developed}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> which complements its nocturnal lifestyle. It {{can distinguish}} between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported {{in only one}} other parrot species. One {{of the most striking}} characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet odour. Given their well-developed <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> this odour may be a pheromone. The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapos.|$|E
5|$|The {{olfactory}} lobes {{are absent}} in porpoises, {{suggesting that they}} have no <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell.</b>|$|E
5|$|The three-sensed {{beings have}} seven with the {{addition}} of the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{first and}} second nerves are really brain lobes, and nerves <b>of</b> the special <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> and sight respectively.|$|R

50|$|Buster Casey is born in {{the rural}} town of Middleton with the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> and taste far more {{advanced}} than any other human.|$|R
5|$|Patton Oswalt as Remy, a rat with a {{heightened}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> enabling a talent and desire for cooking. Director Brad Bird chose Oswalt after hearing his food-related comedy routine.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it feeds}} in flight, the storm petrel is less {{affected}} by oil pollution than other seabirds, {{and may be}} able to use its good <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> to avoid slicks, although a large spill near a breeding colony could have serious consequences.|$|E
5|$|Like most cichlids, such as Oreochromis mossambicus, convicts brood (exhibit {{parental care}} of) both eggs and free-swimming fry. The eggs hatch {{approximately}} 72 hours after fertilization. Until {{that time the}} parents expel intruders and potential egg predators from around the nest. They also fan the eggs, moving water with their fins over the clutch to provide oxygenation. They fan the eggs both day and night; at night they use their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> to recognize {{the presence of the}} eggs in the dark, and they keep their pelvic fins in contact with the eggs to remain at the right distance for fanning. In darkness the pair recognizes each other and detect predators using their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell.</b>|$|E
50|$|Carl Pfaffmann (May 27, 1913 - April 16, 1994) was an American {{physiological}} psychologist. Pfaffman {{was noted}} for his research <b>of</b> the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> and taste.|$|R
50|$|The <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> {{and taste}} (gustatory system) are often {{referred}} to together as the chemosensory system, because they both give the brain information about the chemical composition of objects through a process called transduction.|$|R
50|$|Enixians have preternaturally {{heightened}} <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> {{hearing and}} taste, {{which is both}} a blessing and a curse on planets such as Earth which has odors, sounds and flavors that Enixians {{are not familiar with}} on their own planet.|$|R
5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have a good <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> with which they locate carcasses.|$|E
5|$|The most {{recognizable}} symptoms in Parkinson's disease are movement ("motor") related. Non-motor symptoms, which include autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric problems (mood, cognition, behavior or thought alterations), and sensory (especially altered <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell)</b> and sleep difficulties, are also common. Some of these non-motor symptoms {{may be present}} {{at the time of}} diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The storm petrel's large nasal {{olfactory}} bulbs {{facilitate a}} keen <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> {{and the birds}} themselves have a distinctive musty aroma which can help researchers to locate breeding colonies. Individual petrels recognise their own body scent and {{can use it to}} locate their nest in the dark.|$|E
50|$|Zebras have {{excellent}} hearing and have larger, rounder ears than horses; like other ungulates, zebras can turn their ears {{in almost any}} direction. In addition to superb eyesight and hearing, zebras also have acute <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> and taste.|$|R
50|$|Most {{common side}} effects are gastrointestinal; diarrhoea, nausea, {{abdominal}} pain and vomiting. Less common side effects include central or {{peripheral nervous system}} events such as headaches, dizziness, vertigo, and also the rarely seen rashes, abnormal liver function values and alteration in <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> and taste.|$|R
50|$|Owlwoman has magical {{abilities}} that {{allow her to}} fly by riding air-currents and see in total darkness. She also has heightened <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> and hearing, and has excellent tracking and navigation skills. After she was brainwashed by Queen Bee, Owlwoman gained retractable claws that could slice through steel.|$|R
5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates. This <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E
5|$|Most frogs {{identify}} prey by movement, {{and vision}} {{appears to be}} the primary method by which the cane toad detects prey; however, the cane toad can also locate food using its <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell.</b> They eat a wide range of material; in addition to the normal prey of small rodents, reptiles, other amphibians, birds, and even bats and a range of invertebrates, they also eat plants, dog food, and household refuse.|$|E
5|$|Studies of the {{olfactory}} bulbs of dromaeosaurids {{reveal that}} they had similar olfactory ratios for their size to other non-avian theropods and modern birds with an acute <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> such as tyrannosaurids and the turkey vulture, probably reflecting {{the importance of the}} olfactory sense in the daily activities of dromaeosaurids such as finding food.|$|E
5000|$|Mysterium is an {{unfinished}} musical work by composer Alexander Scriabin. He {{started working on}} the composition in 1903, but left it incomplete {{when he died in}} 1915. Scriabin planned that the work would be synesthetic, exploiting the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> and touch as well as hearing. He wrote that ...|$|R
50|$|Aesthetic {{considerations}} {{within the}} visual arts are usually associated with the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> vision. A painting or sculpture, however, is also perceived spatially by recognized associations and context, and even to some extent by the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> hearing, and touch. The form of the work can be subject to an aesthetic {{as much as the}} content.|$|R
50|$|Lucan {{did have}} special Wolfen skills that were invoked {{when he was}} made very angry. When upset {{to the point of}} {{violence}} his eyes glowed amber. He also had heightened <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> and hearing. In a few episodes he was able to call on his old wolf family/pack for help.|$|R

50|$|The tamandua's small eyes afford limited vision. Instead {{of relying}} on their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> sight, they {{primarily}} utilize their <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> and hearing to locate their insect prey. They use their sharp claws and powerful forearms to tear open the nest of a colony of termites and employ their elongated tongues, coated with sticky saliva, to extract the insects.|$|R
25|$|Some {{dogs are}} trained to silently locate booby traps and {{concealed}} enemies such as snipers. The dog's keen <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> and hearing would make them far more effective at detecting these dangers than humans. The best scout dogs are described as having a disposition intermediate to docile tracking dogs and aggressive attack dogs.|$|R
