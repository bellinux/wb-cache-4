30|$|SBB Cargo has {{developed}} a new business model for the Swiss <b>Split</b> <b>service</b> that integrates {{all parts of the}} process chain into a single product. This means that the entire distribution process from the hinterland terminal to the end customer including the return of the empty container to a depot is optimized. In the new model terminal operations, container movements and container wagons are dispatched from a single source. This will improve efficiency by, for example, increasing the number of round trips per week for container wagons used in Swiss Split from one to two or three a week in future.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, {{the areas}} served by ILR {{continued}} to increase and 1986 the IBA sanctioned in principle the idea that different services could be broadcast on each station's FM and AM frequency.

The first station to permanently split their frequencies was Guildford's County Sound who rebranded the FM output as Premier Radio and turned the AM output into a new golden oldies station, County Sound Gold in 1988.

5000|$|The Court {{pointed out}} that the {{language}} of the DMCA does not ever limit the activities to mere storage. Instead, the DMCA <b>splits</b> <b>service</b> provider into two definitions. The narrower definition is used by § 512(a) and expressly notes that the service provider may not modify the content it receives or transmits. [...] The broader definition, and the one that applies to Veoh, does not contain this narrowing characteristic. [...] The Court also noted that another court had also noted that [...] "gateway" [...] functions, like the one present in this case, should not act as a bar to the Safe Harbor. [...] Thus, the Court concluded that Veoh was not disqualified from § 512(c)'s Safe Harbor due to its automated process in response to user-submitted material.|$|R
