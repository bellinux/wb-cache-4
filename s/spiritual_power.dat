5|$|Kenyon {{taught that}} Christ's {{substitutionary}} atonement secured for believers {{a right to}} divine healing. This was attained through positive, faith-filled speech; the spoken word of God allowed believers to appropriate the same <b>spiritual</b> <b>power</b> that God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ's death and resurrection. Prayer was understood to be a binding, legal act. Rather than asking, Kenyon taught believers to demand healing since they were already legally entitled to receive it.|$|E

Æthelwold obviously {{wanted his}} monasteries to be centres of <b>spiritual</b> <b>power,</b> an aim {{he sought to}} fulfil by making them the home of as many saints as possible. Undoubtedly too he was anxious to remove relics from the guardianship of secular communities to a reformed monastic environment. But ultimately even more vital was the link between cult and territorial possession, focused on the saint's role as protector and spiritual lord of his community.|$|E
5|$|Judith Ryan, senior {{curator at}} the National Gallery of Victoria, {{described}} Makinti's entry in the 2003 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award as:concerned with touching and sensing with fingers, rather than purely visual. The repetition of colour chords and textured striations, which closely echo each other, has a rhapsodic effect akin to many bodies in dance and reveals the inner or <b>spiritual</b> <b>power,</b> the essence, of Makinti Napanangka's country and cultural identity.

5|$|The Sihanaka {{share the}} belief common {{throughout}} the island that {{the spirits of}} ancestors can possess the living, placing them in a trance state called a tromba. The Sihanaka traditionally believe that looking at a cuckoo roller (an indigenous bird) will induce the tromba. Communities look to ombiasy (wise men) for spiritual guidance, to commune with the ancestors, and to determine which days are auspicious for undertaking particular tasks or endeavors. By the 1600s, a uniform religious belief system had grown around a group of sampy (idols) believed to channel the protective <b>spiritual</b> <b>power</b> of 11 deities. The origin of these amulets {{is said to have}} been in the western territories under Sakalava control.|$|E
5|$|At Ambohimanga, as {{in other}} rova sites, the {{cardinal}} and vertical layout of these various traditional components embodies two cosmological notions of space that coexisted in traditional Imerina. The older system governed sociopolitical order and {{was based on the}} concept of the four cardinal points radiating from a unifying center. A more recent system introduced through the astrology of seafaring Arabs governed the spiritual order and placed special significance on the northeast. The sacred eastern portions of Ambohimanga contained structures associated with the veneration of the ancestors, including the royal tombs, basins of holy water used in royal rituals, and numerous Ficus and Draceana trees, which were symbolic of royalty. The northern portion of the site is the location of a courtyard where royal judgments were handed down from atop a prominent granite boulder, in line with the Malagasy association between the northern cardinal point, masculinity, and political power. The houses of the royal wives were formerly located in the southern portion of the site, a cardinal point traditionally associated with femininity and <b>spiritual</b> <b>power.</b> These competing cosmological systems are also reflected in the placement of the city's main gates at cardinal points, as well as the northeastern gates reserved for use by the sovereign and dedicated to their role in sacred rituals.|$|E
5|$|Able {{to return}} to Another world, Serge allies with the Acacia Dragoons against Porre and locates that dimension's Dragon Tear, {{allowing}} him {{to return to}} his human form. He then enters the Sea of Eden, Another world's physical equivalent of the Dead Sea, finding a temporal research facility from the distant future called Chronopolis. Lynx and Kid are inside; Serge defeats Lynx and the supercomputer FATE, allowing the six Dragons of El Nido to steal the Frozen Flame and retire to Terra Tower, a massive structure raised from the sea floor. Kid falls into a coma, and Harle bids the party goodbye to fly with the Dragons. Serge regroups his party and tends to Kid, who remains comatose. Continuing his adventure, he obtains and cleanses the corrupted Masamune sword from Chrono Trigger. He then uses the Dragon relics and shards of the Dragon Tears to create the mythic Element Chrono Cross. The <b>spiritual</b> <b>power</b> of the Masamune later allows him to lift Kid from her coma. At Terra Tower, the prophet of time, revealed to be Belthasar from Chrono Trigger, visits him with visions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca. Serge learns that the time research facility Chronopolis created El Nido thousands of years ago after a catastrophic experimental failure drew it to the past. The introduction of a temporally foreign object in history caused the planet to pull in a counterbalance from a different dimension. This was Dinopolis, a city of Dragonians—parallel universe descendants of Chrono Triggers Reptites. The institutions warred and Chronopolis subjugated the Dragonians. Humans captured their chief creation—the Dragon God, an entity capable of controlling nature.|$|E

25|$|In the West {{the issue}} of the {{separation}} of church and state during the medieval period centered on monarchs who ruled in the secular sphere but encroached on the Church's rule of the spiritual sphere. This unresolved contradiction in ultimate control of the Church led to power struggles and crises of leadership, notably in the Investiture Controversy, which was resolved in the Concordat of Worms in 1122. By this concordat, the Emperor renounced the right to invest ecclesiastics with ring and crosier, the symbols of their <b>spiritual</b> <b>power,</b> and guaranteed election by the canons of cathedral or abbey and free consecration.|$|E

25|$|Like {{other forms}} of evangelical Protestantism, Pentecostalism adheres to the inerrancy of the Bible and the {{necessity}} of accepting Christ as personal lord and savior.

It also provides a model of the universe that dates back thousands of years (Shirres, 1997); a model made up of two intimately connected worlds: the spiritual and the material.
