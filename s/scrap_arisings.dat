40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review, and draw {{attention}} to, issues raised by the recycling of wrought aluminium from motor cars, even though the time horizon for significant arisings of such aluminium scrap is in the order of 20 years from now. Recycling of specific grades of wrought aluminium will be viable only when a means of positively identifying different types of scrap is available. A solution must be reliable, rapid, and low-cost; probably used in conjunction with a vehicle shredder. Such a system of identification will eliminate the need for costly hand-dismantling and segregation. Simple segregation of cast and wrought alloy will, however, be essential when wrought aluminium from car bodies dominates the <b>scrap</b> <b>arisings.</b> Such segregation will produce two high-value scrap products. The first of which will be similar to the A 380 casting alloy specification, maintaining the current supply of this scrap, and the second will be a composite of wrought alloys. These issues are relevant to the aluminium scrap industry, which will have to accommodate future changes in the composition of the scrap it receives, and the motor industry, which may adopt in-house recycling of wrought alloy in order to offset the high! purchase cost of aluminium...|$|E
40|$|The {{combustion}} of coal {{for power}} generation {{will continue to}} play a major role in the future, however, this must be achieved using cleaner technologies than we use at present. <b>Scrap</b> tyre <b>arisings</b> in the UK are 400, 000 tonnes per year amounting to 30 million tyres and in the EU as a whole, more than 2. 5 million tonnes of tyres per year are scrapped. The recent EC Waste Landfill Directive (1999) sets a deadline for the banning of whole and shredded tyres from landfill sites by 2006. Consequently, there is an urgent need to find a mass disposal route for tyres. We describe, in this paper, a novel use for tyre rubber pulverised fuel in a NOx reburning process which may have an application in power station boilers. This method of disposal could represent a way of combining waste disposal, energy recovery and pollution control within one process. A preliminary study of micronised tyre combustion was undertaken to identify the suitable size ranges for application in NOx reduction by reburning. Tests were performed in a down-fired, pulverised fuel combustor (PFC) operating at about 80 kW. Superior combustion characteristics, i. e. burnout were achieved with particle sizes less than 250 Î¼m. A South African coal was used as the primary fuel in the reburn tests and the tyre was fed pneumatically via a separate feed system. Parameters studied, were, reburn zone stoichiometry and reburn fuel fraction. Additionally, the carbon content of the ash was carefully monitored for any effect on burnout at the fuel rich reburn stoichiometries. The NOx reductions achieved with tyres are compared with reburning with coal. NOx reductions up to 80...|$|R
