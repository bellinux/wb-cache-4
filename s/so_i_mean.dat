500|$|Gatiss: They're {{hiding in}} their burglar masks behind the curtain, and this random woman comes and shoots Milverton {{in the face}} and then grinds her heel into his face. It's odd, isn't it? <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> really, it's just an {{extrapolation}} of saying, 'Well, he probably did it, I think.' ...|$|E
500|$|Of her character's changes after season five, Kirshner stated: [...] "I think she'll {{continue}} {{to be just like}} a tumbleweed and a car crash and I'm happy for that, I don't want it to be wrapped up. She'll never be normal and that's just the way it is." [...] Responding to the criticism Jenny has received, Kirshner states: [...] "Well, I agree with what's said about the character for the most part. But again... it's my job. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> it's a fun character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Banville {{has said}} that he imitated James Joyce as a boy: [...] "After I'd read the Dubliners, and was struck at the way Joyce wrote about real life, I {{immediately}} started writing bad imitations of the Dubliners." [...] However, The Guardian reports: [...] "Banville himself has acknowledged that all Irish writers are followers of either Joyce or Beckett – and he places himself in the Beckett camp." [...] He has also acknowledged other influences. During a 2011 interview on The Charlie Rose Show, Rose asked, [...] "The guiding light has always been Henry James?" [...] and Banville replied, [...] "I think <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> people say, you know, I've been influenced by Beckett or Nabokov but it's always been Henry James [...] so I would follow him, I would be a Jamesian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We ain't sure o' that sir. To-morrow, they say, never comes," [...] {{returned}} Disco. [...] "It's my {{ambition to}} let fly a broadside at a lion or a elephant <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>means</b> for to go on; an' wot I says is, Who wolunteers to sail in company?" ...|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. Well, but did Mr. Badman and {{his master}} agree <b>so</b> well? <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> his last master, {{since they were}} birds of a feather, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> since they were so well met for wickedness.|$|R
60|$|Atten. Well, but did Mr. Badman and his Master agree <b>so</b> well? <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> {{his last}} Master, {{since they were}} Birds of a Feather, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> since they were so well met for wickedness.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> it! What's {{the good}} of a man frittering away his life? What's {{the good of}} wishing for what you can't get?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} not, and if <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> nothing {{particular}} as to your intelligence. He, at any rate, is a scoundrel. Mountjoy--you know Mountjoy?" ...|$|E
60|$|ESSIE (greatly {{disappointed}} that he, {{of all people}} should begin at her in this way) Yes. (She looks doubtfully at Judith.) I think <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> I--I hope so.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you've {{shared with}} me," [...] Cassandra said. [...] "Why can't I share with you? Why am <b>I</b> <b>so</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>I</b> {{know why it}} is," [...] she added. [...] "We {{understand}} each other, William and I. You've never understood each other. You're too different." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her hand {{upon his}} arm, her face drawn and white with fear, {{recalled}} him to himself. He laughed harshly. [...] "No--oh no; I'm not mad, but it's {{enough to make}} me <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>mean</b> it--of course <b>I</b> didn't <b>mean</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He owes me {{a little}} money,--twelve hundred or <b>so,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to have it. I suppose he is in debt, but not much, I think. He makes stupid bets, and the devil won't break him of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{there is}} no doubt of that, Bullen; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to spend all the time I have to spare here on my back; and sleep, if I can, continuously." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As sure as the Gospels, {{your honor}} I've served {{five years in}} the Cork Militia, and wore the badge as a marksman; and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to 'list, and go as your honors' sarvint." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{want you}} to think about it. I want to {{interest}} you in this fellow's favour; and in doing <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to be very open with you. I suppose you'll give her something?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} be a part of corps {{etiquette}} to keep a dog or <b>so,</b> too. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> a corps dog--the common property of the organization, like the corps steward or head servant; then there are other dogs, owned by individuals.|$|R
3000|$|... is the {{stoichiometry}} vector for reaction k. For simplicity, we will suppress “k” in our notation <b>so</b> {{that state}} <b>i</b> <b>means</b> state [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... “Asking yourself? That {{means that}} you are really asking me. But why do it <b>so</b> publicly? <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> it. One single, {{detached}} presence {{is enough to make}} a public. One alone. Why not wait till he returns to those regions of space and air—from which he came.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} our goods are going away too fast, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to try if these Skraelingers will give their furs for dairy produce. We have {{a good deal of}} that, and can spare some." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly; only do {{something}} first {{to show that}} you are <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> also to look to that; but I shall be well contented if I find myself in the house in twenty years' time,--or perhaps in thirty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know: a {{man that}} does not fight, I think. I don't care what a shaveling says: <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> just to go and wish, and I won't {{sacrifice}} anything. There can't be any harm in that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{an awkward}} person," [...] said his Lordship. [...] "The left hand, however, is nearest the heart; <b>so</b> be assured <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> no discourtesy." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fanny Assingham sharply laughed, then irrepressibly {{fell back}} to her {{constant}} position. [...] "You're splendid--perfectly splendid." [...] To which, as the Princess, shaking an impatient head, wouldn't have it again at all, she subjoined: [...] "Or if you're not it's because you're <b>so</b> sure. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> sure of HIM." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm on {{the side}} of both. I guess I'm a little {{on the side}} of everything. In a revolution--after it was well begun--I think I should be a high, proud loyalist. One sympathises more with them, and they've a chance to behave <b>so</b> exquisitely. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> picturesquely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} for a long trip in {{southern}} Europe. Do you know that I have scarcely been away from this place for twenty years, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to celebrate the conclusion of our studies by taking a holiday." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was another}} silence. And {{as she was}} plainly {{shrinking}} from talking turkey, I was reluctantly compelled to do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> somebody had got to. Too dashed silly, a male and female in our position simply standing eating salmon and cheese at one another without a word.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} wouldn't swallow {{nothing less than}} wine in them togs?" [...] said the other, raising his glass to his lips. [...] "Well, here's better luck, and I'm blessed if it's not wanting. I'm pretty well tired of this go, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to let 'em know pretty plainly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, certainly, certainly," [...] said Mr. Lyddell. [...] "Old {{friends for}} ever! <b>So</b> mind, Marian, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> {{to be very}} angry if you forget to write to Miss Wortley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh,' cried Dolores, 'I {{thought he}} was dead! He told me <b>so!</b> Uncle Alfred, <b>I</b> <b>mean!</b> And it was only to get the money! How could he be so wicked?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Swithin, don't speak so affectedly, {{when you}} know <b>so</b> well what <b>I</b> <b>mean!</b> <b>Is</b> it nothing to you that, after all our vows for life, you have thought it right to--flirt with a village girl?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I must trust him," [...] said Gaff, [...] "but I've had no {{experience}} of him; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to `make assurance doubly sure,' as the prophet says, if it wasn't the poet--an' that's why I'll write this letter. If it don't do no good, it won't do no harm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Collie," [...] {{said the}} old rancher, [...] "it needn't never have been told, an' wouldn't but fer one reason. I'm gettin' old. I reckon I'd never split my {{property}} between you an' Jack. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> you an' him to marry. You always steadied Jack. With a wife like you'll be--wal, mebbe Jack'll--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{cruel and}} unjust, Grandfather. I have done no wrong ... {{it is not}} doing wrong to develop the one gift I have. It's the only thing I can do ... and I {{am going to do}} it. My mother was an actress and a good woman. So is Aunt Annice. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it is, indeed," [...] said Mary Louise, panting {{a little}} from her run. [...] "I saw you throw things, a minute ago, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> guess you <b>mean</b> to run away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't jest," [...] she begged. [...] "It {{hurts me}} <b>so.</b> What <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> is surely plain enough. I will {{continue}} to live under your roof if you wish it, or I am perfectly willing {{to go back to}} Wood Norton. I {{will continue to}} bear your name because I must, but the other ties between us are finished." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{longed to}} ask what sort of braces she wears, to keep her <b>so</b> straight. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to by and by; she looks as if she wouldn't snub a body;" [...] and Sally vainly tried to square her own round shoulders, bent with much poring over books, for she was the bright girl of the school.|$|R
