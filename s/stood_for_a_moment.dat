25|$|Hunter died at 8:20pm on 9 October 2006 – {{just five}} days short of his 28th {{birthday}} – at the Kirkwood Hospice in Huddersfield. Prior to the Premier League Snooker matches on 12 October 2006, players Jimmy White, Ronnie O'Sullivan, Ken Doherty and Ding Junhui, along with referee Alan Chamberlain and commentators Willie Thorne and Phil Yates, all <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of silence to remember Hunter. He left a wife, Lindsey, and one daughter.|$|E
60|$|Lady Greendale <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{speechless}} {{with surprise}} and consternation.|$|E
60|$|Miss Panney {{returned}} the salutation, and <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't suppose, sergeant, {{that these}} naked beggars {{are going to}} <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> against <b>a</b> charge of eight hundred cavalry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... [He {{swallows}} the epithet and <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> swearing and raging foully to himself. But {{he knows}} that his cue is to be sympathetic. He takes refuge in generous indignation.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... (FISHER <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> irresolute; then goes. As {{soon as she}} {{has gone}} LADY MARY puts down her book and weeps. She is a pretty woman, {{but this is the}} only pretty thing we have seen her do yet.) ...|$|R
60|$|They <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in silence. Katharine {{laughed a}} little nervously.|$|E
60|$|The lady {{arose from}} her chair and <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{thinking}} deeply.|$|E
60|$|Arthur <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> irresolute and hesitating, {{but only}} for a moment.|$|E
6000|$|... [The STATION OFFICIAL has appeared; he <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> [...] casting his {{commands}} at the seated group. The DUTCH YOUTH also [...] rises, {{and takes}} his coat and hat. The OFFICIAL turns on his [...] heel and retires still issuing directions.] ...|$|R
60|$|He {{sprang to}} his feet and <b>stood</b> there, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> unsteadily.|$|R
60|$|Julian <b>stood</b> {{speechless}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{his fists}} clenched, his eyes ablaze.|$|R
60|$|She {{came through}} the gateway and <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> at my side.|$|E
60|$|The party below, after Marks had fired, <b>stood,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> rather undecided.|$|E
60|$|He {{mechanically}} did the same, {{and then}} they <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> awe- stricken.|$|E
60|$|Mike <b>stood</b> silent <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and {{his eyes}} began to brighten.|$|R
6000|$|Welling, aghast: [...] "Thought my {{note was}} for Miss Rice? Sent it to her? Gracious powers!" [...] They all <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in silence, and then Welling {{glances at the}} paper in his hand. [...] "But there's some mistake. You haven't sent my note to Miss Rice: here it is now!" ...|$|R
60|$|Holderness <b>stood</b> still <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> There was <b>a</b> queer {{look in his}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|The boy {{disappeared}} {{down the}} hill. They <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> side by side.|$|E
60|$|I <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> conceiving this {{extraordinary}} picture. Then a question occurred to me.|$|E
60|$|So they <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> while Cynthia made {{a supreme}} effort to speak calmly.|$|E
6000|$|... (He <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> troubled, {{glancing at}} ASHER, torn between [...] loyalty to his {{employer}} and affection for his son. Then {{he goes out}} [...] slowly, upper right. All the while DR. JONATHAN has stood in the [...] rear of the room, occasionally glancing at GEORGE. He now comes [...] forward, unobtrusively, yet withal impressively.) ...|$|R
60|$|His blood <b>stood</b> still <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Then {{the smile}} came again within him, steady, cruel.|$|R
60|$|The woman <b>stood</b> still <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{looking at}} him. Then {{she drew a}} step nearer.|$|R
60|$|She <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> rather stiffly, staring away {{towards the}} blue hills of Alsace.|$|E
60|$|Jack Rooney <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in deep thought, {{and then}} {{scratched}} his grizzled chin.|$|E
60|$|Thomson <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> deep in thought, then {{he turned}} away from the desk.|$|E
60|$|Vernon rises. He {{looks at}} the portrait--draws nearer to it. With {{his hands in his}} pockets, stops dead in front of it, and contemplates it in silence. The door of the dressing-room opens. Fanny enters. She is dressed for going out. She <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> the door in her hand. Vernon turns. She closes the door and comes forward.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{doubt you}} not, sir," [...] the duke said warmly. [...] "You will {{understand}} that it cannot but seem strange that you at your age -- for {{it seems to me}} that you cannot be more than nineteen -- should have been able to <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> against one of the best swordsmen in France, to say nothing of having slain him." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{crossed the}} room towards the {{hearthrug}} and <b>stood</b> there <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> leaning against the mantelpiece.|$|R
60|$|A sudden calmness {{seemed to}} come to her and she <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{thinking}} aloud.|$|E
60|$|He <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> motionless, {{staring at}} her, a tall figure, {{careless}} of the rain.|$|E
60|$|Her aunt <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{looking at}} her, and then crept {{out of the}} room.|$|E
60|$|I <b>stood</b> amazed. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> I hardly {{realized}} {{the meaning of}} the words that had been spoken.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A skilful equivoque {{that last}} of yours, Master Micah,' quoth Decimus Saxon, 'though smacking of double dealing in a truth-lover like yourself. If we meet them in battle I trust {{that it may}} be with chevaux-de-frise of pikes and morgenstierns before us, and a litter of caltrops in front of them, for Monmouth has no cavalry that could <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> against the Royal Guards.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... (The matron goes to {{the rear}} where Miss Bailey is sitting [...] with Mrs. Abner. She beckons to Miss Bailey, who gets up with [...] a scared look, and {{they go to the}} far left corner of the room. [...] Eileen <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> hesitating--then starts to go to [...] Murray, but just at this moment Peters comes forward and [...] speaks to Murray.) ...|$|R
