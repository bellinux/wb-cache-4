40|$|We have {{prepared}} various morphological PbS nano–microcrystallites by three different techniques namely, facile hydrothermal technique, chemical bath deposition and surfactant-assisted solution growth. This {{is the first}} report on the photoluminescence emission bands around 0. 60 eV and their evolution with temperature in dendrite/rod shaped PbS microstructures. The 0. 60 eV band, which is common to all our samples, quenches at low temperatures up to 60 – 70 K. However, after <b>surface</b> <b>capping</b> with mercaptoethanol (C 2 H 5 OSH), a new band around 1. 0 eV appears and evolves with temperature, indicating bimodal size distribution in these dendritic nanostructures. On the other hand, the samples grown by chemical bath deposition exhibited this bimodal size distribution even without <b>surface</b> <b>capping.</b> However, after surface is protected with mercaptoethanol, enhancement in 0. 60 eV band intensity (4 – 5 times) with lowering temperature is a specific characteristic of these samples. Anomalous temperature dependence of photoluminescence intensity with corresponding changes in full width at half maxima is an interesting behaviour that indicates thermalization of the carriers in nano-particles of different sizes. We note that the <b>surface</b> <b>capping</b> {{is an important step}} in understanding the bimodal nature of hydrothermal grown nanostructure and microstructure.

40|$|The {{applicability}} of bentonite as a lining material for isolation of waste disposal sites was investigated on laboratory and field scale. The permeability of sand-bento-nite mixtures {{depends on the}} type of bentonite, the bentonite content in the mixture and the dry bulk density. In laboratory experiments the saturated conductivity decreased at low hydraulic head gradients, indicating that water flow in these mix-tures does not obey Darcy’s law. The swelling of the bentonite, which is responsible for the low permeability, is a time-dependent process. The permeability decreased with time and even after two months the permeability had not reached a constant level. In sand-bentonite mixtures with 5 % (w/w) bentonite, the saturated conduc-tivity ultimately reached a level below 1 x 10 - 10 m s- 1, which is sufficiently low for <b>surface</b> <b>capping</b> of waste disposal sites. The sand-bentonite mixtures were 10 - 100 times more permeable for landfill leachate than for clean water. Bottom liners should, therefore, contain considerably more bentonite to prevent infiltration of leachate in the subsoil. Water-balance studies on experimental fields showed that there was no leakage at all through bentonite liners used for <b>surface</b> <b>capping</b> of a waste disposal site over a two-year period.

In this study, a pluripotent Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) model, C 3 H/ 10 T 1 / 2, {{was used for the}} study of three bioceramic materials, namely the hydroxyapatite (HA), α-Tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP) and β-Tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP). Biochemical methods (ALP enzymatic assay and RT-qPCR) and physical assessment (DAPI staining and SEM) were employed to assess the osteo-inductivity of the materials. The predicted osteo-inductivity from the experiments were utilized both to compare with a less complex system (Simulated Body Fluid system) and a more complex system (in vivo bone formation / osteo-inductivity in dog) in order to assess two correlations. Among the bone markers selected for the biochemical assessment, alkaline phosphate (ALPL) shows the most prominent difference among different materials and across time period. Thus it is chosen as the marker for comparison and the relative expression is: HA > β-TCP > α-TCP. The cell density and proliferation difference from the DAPI staining, TCP (α and β) >> HA, implies the osteo-inductivity of cells is: HA > TCP as differentiated cells proliferate less. SEM examination shows that the cells on the porous scaffolds of the evaluated materials were distributed across the pores and bone “nodules” were observed. The SBF study in this project shows that the <b>surface</b> <b>CaP</b> formation ability is: HA > β-TCP > α-TCP, suggesting there may be correlation between the <b>surface</b> <b>CaP</b> formation ability and the in vitro osteo-inductivity.

It was concluded that the ALP expression of 10 T 1 / 2 cells cultured on bioceramics may provide a reflective measurement to predict the in vivo osteo-inductivity of bioceramics. The results of this work suggest two possible correlations: one between in vitro osteo-inductivity and in vitro <b>surface</b> <b>CaP</b> formation in SBF and another one between in vitro osteo-inductivity and in vivo osteo-inductivity.
