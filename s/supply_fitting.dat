5000|$|An {{alternative}} to a low-pressure compressor for gas supply is high-pressure storage cylinders feeding through a pressure regulator which will be set to the required supply pressure for the depth and equipment in use. In practice HP storage {{may be used for}} either reserve gas supply or both main and reserve gas supplies to a gas panel. High-pressure bulk cylinders are quiet in operation and provide gas of known quality (if it has been tested). This allows the relatively simple and reliable use of nitrox mixtures in surface-supplied diving. Bulk cylinders are also quiet in operation compared to a low-pressure compressor, but have the obvious limitation of amount of gas available.The usual configurations for surface-supplied bulk gas storage are large single cylinders of around 50 litres water capacity, often referred to as [...] "J"s or [...] "bombs","quads", which are a group (sometimes, but not necessarily four in number) of similar cylinders mounted on a frame and connected together to a common <b>supply</b> <b>fitting,</b> and [...] "kellys" [...] which are a group of [...] "tubes" [...] (long large volume pressure vessels) usually mounted in a container frame, and usually connected together to a common connection fitting.|$|E

We fully include {{the effect of}} the gravitational wave modes, including the predicted relation of the amplitude of these modes to that of the density perturbations. We provide the normalization of the matter power spectrum, which can be directly used for large-scale structure studies. The normalization for tilted spectra is a special case. We also provide fitting functions for the inflationary energy scale of COBE-normalized models and discuss the validity of approximating the spectra by power-laws. In an Appendix, we extend our analysis to include models with a cosmological constant, both with and without gravitational waves. Comment: 5 pages LaTeX file, using RevTeX. A correction is made to the final fitting function, Eq. A 5. This correction only affects models which have BOTH gravitational waves and a cosmological constan...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: To gain {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the internal work processes in service-oriented supply chains, it is very important to design models that are able to realistically describe the components of the supply chain. To meet this goal, it is necessary to find suitable statistical distributions of the processing times for the orders passing the chain. In this article we examine sample data sets with more than 2, 000 individual work times from four steps in the work processes of a time-based aeronautical supply chain and derive the best possible distributions fitting the sample data sets. To increase the realism of the model, both the data sets and the resulting statistical distributions were subdivided into several categories of order complexities, a task made more challenging by the limited amount of data available for the rarer high-complexity orders.

50|$|By 1966, AGRU’s first {{injection}} molding machines were in operation producing fittings for pipeline construction, making AGRU {{one of the}} first manufacturers in Europe to <b>supply</b> pipes and <b>fittings</b> from their own production facilities. The productivity gain during manufacturing was significant. Up to this point, fittings were segmented and required pipes to be welded together.

Finally, by producing the pipes from one mould pressure resistance can be increased.|$|R
