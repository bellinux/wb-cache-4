5|$|The Shakespeare authorship {{question}} is the argument that <b>someone</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote the works attributed to him. Anti-Stratfordians—a collective term for adherents of the various alternative-authorship theories—believe that Shakespeare of Stratford was a front to shield {{the identity of the}} real author or authors, who for some reason did not want or could not accept public credit. Although the idea has attracted much public interest, all but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe belief and, for the most part, acknowledge it only to rebut or disparage the claims.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally {{the work}} was {{ascribed}} to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text.

Blake thinks that Richard was the author, but he considers the evidence to be inconclusive. Janet Fairweather, a classicist and a recent translator of the Liber, suggests that it may have been written by <b>someone</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> the traditional candidates.

When Becket protested to Pope Alexander III over this usurpation {{of the right of}} the archbishop to crown English kings, Alexander not only stated that no such permission had been granted but threatened to suspend or depose any bishop who crowned Henry's heir. Barlow thinks it possible that Barre received a verbal agreement from the pope in January to allow the coronation, but there is no written evidence that Alexander agreed to allow the coronation in 1170.|$|E
5|$|In a {{statement}} on its website, ReactOS cited differing legal definitions of what constitutes clean-room reverse engineering as a cause for the conflict. Some countries, including the United States, require that a reimplementation based on disassembled code must be written by <b>someone</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> the person having disassembled and examined the original code, whereas other countries allow both tasks to be performed by the same individual. Consequently, ReactOS clarified that its Intellectual Property Policy Statement requirements on clean room reverse engineering conform to US law. An internal source code audit was conducted to ensure that only clean room reverse engineering was used, and all developers were made to sign an agreement committing them {{to comply with the}} project's policies on reverse engineering. Contributors to its development were not affected by these events, and all access to the software development tools was restored shortly afterward. In September 2007, with the audit nearing completion, the audit status was removed from the ReactOS homepage. Though the audit was completed, specific details were not made public as it was only an internal effort to ensure compliance with the project's own policies.|$|E

500|$|It was {{not until}} the [...] finale that it is {{revealed}} that Grissom and Sara have worked through whatever issues they had, and are, in fact, a couple, and have been for two years. This revelation caused mixed reviews among critics, some of them see this relationship as CSI [...] "jumping the shark", an attempt to include more drama and romance to the show, so as to be able to compete with the medical drama Grey's Anatomy, which airs at around the same time. By killing off the sexual tension between the two characters and making them an item, the production crew were seen to be adding more personal drama to the show, increasing the appeal to some of Grey's Anatomys younger audience. This has been denied by the writers, Carol Mendelsohn even said that she has never been able to see Grissom with <b>someone</b> else <b>other</b> <b>than</b> Sara and that this episode was seen by the writers as the right time to reveal the relationship, Jorja Fox and William Petersen have also admitted that the relationship is not new.|$|R
25|$|Scenes {{from the}} Odyssey are common on Greek pottery, the Circe episode among them. The two most common {{representations}} have Circe {{surrounded by the}} transformed sailors and Odysseus threatening the sorceress with his sword. In {{the case of the}} former, the animals are not always boars but also include, for instance, the ram, dog and lion on the 6th century BCE Boston kylix. Often the transformation is only partial, involving the head and perhaps a sprouting tail, {{while the rest of the}} body is human. In describing an otherwise obscure fifth-century Greek bronze in the Walters Art Museum that takes the form of a man on all fours with the foreparts of a pig, the commentator asks in what other way could an artist depict <b>someone</b> bewitched <b>other</b> <b>than</b> as a man with an animal head. In these scenes Circe is shown almost invariably stirring the potion with her wand, although the incident as described in Homer has her use the wand only to bewitch the sailors after they have refreshed themselves. One exception is the Berlin amphora on which the seated Circe holds the wand towards a half transformed man.|$|R

She also showed deep fascination with classical piano music played in front of her, which researchers believed was because she could hear some piano music during her childhood.

A void contract can be one in which any of the prerequisites of a valid contract is/are absent for example if there is no contractual capacity, the contract can be deemed as void. In fact, void means that a contract does not exist at all.

40|$|Our {{lives are}} full of decisions. The more {{significant}} these decisions are, the more eagerly we hope to make our choice coherent to our identity {{in order to live}} like oneself. It is obvious that we should support these decisions that are true to oneself. In my view, however, it is not sufficient to focus on the support for these decisions alone. For we do not always get what we want as results of these decisions. Sometimes the best choice for us provides the worst result. In such a situation, our identity will be in danger. In this paper I examine these identity-crisis situations, then consider the way how we restore our identity which are frustrated. My answer to this question is the following. In these identity-crisis situations, we restore our identity by redescribing the situation. Such brand-new description will give us the new perspective through which we are able to view the situation with different meaning. Through this process, our identity may have to change in some respect, but such new identity make possible to live like oneself again. The most significant point is that such a brand-new description is often given to us from another person. Here is the another possibility for the support <b>someone's</b> identity <b>other</b> <b>than</b> support for one's decision-making. It is to give another interpretation for one's situation and show another life to live on...|$|R
2500|$|Obsessions are {{thoughts}} that recur and persist despite efforts to ignore or confront them. People with OCD frequently perform tasks, or compulsions, to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. Within and among individuals, the initial obsessions, or intrusive thoughts, {{vary in their}} clarity and vividness. A relatively vague obsession could involve a general sense of disarray or tension accompanied by a belief that life cannot proceed as normal while the imbalance remains. A more intense obsession could be a preoccupation with the thought or image of someone close to them dying or intrusions related to [...] "relationship rightness". Other obsessions concern the possibility that <b>someone</b> or something <b>other</b> <b>than</b> oneself—such as God, the Devil, or disease—will harm either the person with OCD or the people or things that the person cares about.

40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{understanding}} of women's longitudinal patterns of smoking during the pre-conception, pregnancy and postnatal {{period and the}} factors associated with these patterns could help better inform smoking cessation services and interventions. METHODS: Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to empirically identify women's smoking patterns {{in a sample of}} 10, 768 mothers from the 2010 UK Infant Feeding Survey. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify characteristics associated with these patterns. RESULTS: LCA identified five distinct smoking patterns during the pre-conception, pregnancy and postnatal period: "non-smokers" (74. 1 % of women); "pregnancy-inspired quitters" (10. 2 %); "persistent smokers" (10. 1 %); "temporary quitters" (4. 4 %); and postnatal quitters (1. 1 %). Smoking patterns varied markedly according to socio-demographic variables and parity. After adjusting for these variables, mothers who lived during pregnancy with a partner who smoked {{were more likely to be}} temporary quitters (aOR 2. 64, 95 % CI 1. 74 - 3. 99) or persistent smokers (aOR 3. 32, 95 % CI 2. 34 - 4. 72) than pregnancy-inspired quitters. Mothers who lived during pregnancy with <b>someone</b> else <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a partner who smoked were more likely to be persistent smokers (aOR 2. 34, 95 % CI 1. 38 - 3. 97) or postnatal quitters (aOR 2. 97, 95 % CI 1. 07 - 8. 24) than pregnancy-inspired quitters. Mothers given information on how their partner could stop smoking if they lived during pregnancy with a smoking partner were less likely to be persistent smokers (aOR 0. 42, 95 % CI 0. 27 - 0. 65) than pregnancy-inspired quitters. CONCLUSION: Health professionals should ask about smoking at every opportunity, and refer women who self-report as current smokers to an evidence based smoking cessation service...|$|R

He wrote him a letter, and Norm responded with [...] "If you're ever in Chicago, drop me a line and we'll give you a tour", so 2 weeks later he booked a flight and got {{a tour of the}} new Bally factory in Bensenville. After lunch Norm offered to drive him back to the airport, but John said [...] "I'm not going back, you're {{going to have to give}} me a job". After Norm realized he wasn't joking around, he agreed to hire him. They hired him as a technician in engineering because he had experience troubleshooting games with a Pinball router in Toronto that had about 350 games. One of the designs John had come up with on his own while still in Toronto was Alice in wonderland, which would later become a theme he would revisit.In 1989 he arrived at the new office, Jokerz! was still on test, and his first project was Ice Castle (which never got produced). He shared an office with another designer, and eventually was begged to work on World Cup Soccer 94 because nobody else wanted to tackle that theme. This is the only pinball design that had to be finished by <b>someone</b> else, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> being a family emergency or an accident (see Dennis Nordman's motorcycle accident on Elivra and the party monsters).He would go on to working on four other titles before Williams shut down the pinball division.
