25|$|Klingons <b>see</b> <b>{{something}}</b> <b>that</b> isn't {{growing as}} something that is dying. A Klingon fights not for sport but to gain an advantage for the Empire, for his family and for himself. There {{is a sense of}} paranoia, as others are constantly watching all one's activities in order to seek advancement. This leads to a morality that Federation races see as often cruel and remorseless.|$|E
25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of {{previous}} live-action promotional shorts, Landfall and The Life, 343 Industries, the studio in charge of development for the Halo franchise, wanted to use a live action series to appeal {{to an audience of}} people unfamiliar with the Halo games. The director of franchise business management at 343 Industries, Matt McClosky, explained the intended audience by saying that, [...] "You <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> looks like a video game, you're going to get the same crowd you always get." [...] The live-action format was also chosen for its ability to better develop characters; the series is used to introduce the character Thomas Lasky to the Halo universe before his role in the video game Halo 4. The developers wanted a protagonist with more emotion than Master Chief (whose face is never seen), to not only convey an understanding of the universe, but to better engage unfamiliar viewers.|$|E

500|$|Appearing {{in series}} two, Ianto assists {{the team in}} field {{missions}} and {{is used by the}} writers as a vehicle for one-liner jokes. Commenting on this, portrayer Gareth David-Lloyd notes that [...] "This season it's much more relaxed and he's not all about keeping secrets, he's about Torchwood and Jack— he's found his meaning and his place so his dry humour comes out a lot more and he's happier." [...] The developments in Ianto's character were also reflected in the wardrobe choice. [...] "For series two," [...] comments Ray Holman, [...] "we evolved the look quite a lot, and now his suits {{come from all over the}} place. It's just a question of where I <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> looks right for Gareth, so I've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next. We realised we could be a bit more flash with Ianto now he's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more. So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties. He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he's evolving into something much sharper, which looks really good filmed in high definition." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E

And again, I feel there are too many things {{happening}} that are taking our rights away." ...|$|E

40|$|Warning - There is a three-letter word {{below that}} might be {{offensive}} – a slang word used to describe a persons rear end - but sometimes {{you just have to}} call it what it is. I reflected recently on the difference between work and a job. The worker <b>sees</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> needs to be done and pursues it because it advances the organization. The holder of the job <b>sees</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> needs to be done, and may or may not do it based on {{whether or not it is}} his or her job. The essential difference between these two people is simply that a worker improves the organization and the holder of a job covers his (here it comes!) ass...|$|R

2500|$|Much of Smart's direct artistic {{stimulation}} came from, literally, {{a passing}} glance {{as he was}} driving: [...] "My paintings have their origins in a passing glance". [...] "Sometimes I'll drive around for months... despair, nothing, nothing, then suddenly I will <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> seizes me: a shape, a combination of shapes, a play of light or shadows and I send up a prayer because I know I have the gem of a picture." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{is barely}} any {{recalled}} memory {{in cases of}} fear and trauma exposure, brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, pain, or anxiety. Recall memory is very limited, since the only memory people have that suffer from these problems is the flash backs of what happened when the event took place. People can only recall the memory that happened on that day when they hear or <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> brings the memory into existence. They cannot recall how they felt or what they saw, but through images or audio people can recall that tragic event. For example, the day of September 11, 2001, first responders remember the day {{and what it was}} like; but the feelings they could not recall. The only way to recall the feelings they had were when sirens of police vehicles, fire trucks, and ambulances drove by their house they feel the exact feelings that were in effect on that day.|$|E
