25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

She stated that she never intended to question Obama's patriotism. [...] "I made a misstatement. I said a comment that I would take back. I did not, nor do I, question Barack Obama's patriotism... I {{did not say that}} Barack Obama is anti-American nor do I believe that Barack Obama is anti-American... I'm very concerned about Barack Obama's views. I don't believe that socialism is a good thing for America." [...] However, in March 2010, Bachmann said, [...] "I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> very serious concerns that Barack Obama had anti-American views—and now I look like Nostradamus" [...] while speaking at a fund-raiser for the Susan B. Anthony List. A year later, in March 2011, Bachmann was asked on Meet the Press if she still believed that Obama held un-American views. She responded [...] "I believe that the actions of this government have, have been emblematic of ones that have not been based on true American values." [...] Pressed for clarification, she said [...] "I've already answered that question before. I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> very serious concerns about the president's views." ...|$|E

[...] In that match, [...] at Bristol, Robinson took 2–168 as Hammond stroked 143. [...] "You were only paid if you played and I was never sure of my place.

2500|$|Merman's {{fourth and}} final {{marriage}} was to actor Ernest Borgnine. They were married in Beverly Hills on June 27, 1964. They separated on August 7 and Borgnine filed for divorce on October 21. Merman filed a cross-complaint shortly thereafter charging Borgnine with extreme cruelty. She was granted a divorce on November 18, 1964. Borgnine later told fellow actor Frank Wilson that {{he spent most of}} his short marriage arguing with Merman. By the end, he recounted how she came back from a film one day and said, [...] "The director said I looked sensational. He <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the face of a 20-year-old, and the body and legs of a 30-year-old!" [...] Borgnine replied, [...] "Did he say anything about your old cunt?"

When Shane Warne {{justified}} Australia's decision to not play in Colombo during the 1996 Cricket World Cup due to the terrorist threat – saying that he could be targeted by a drive-in bomber while he was shopping – Kadirgamar is reported to have said [...] "shopping is for sissies." [...] Kadirgamar commented later [...] "There was a storm of protest in Australia. A TV interviewer asked me whether I had ever played cricket. [...] I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> played before he was born – without helmets and thigh guards, on matting wickets that were full of holes and stones, and I had my share of broken bones to show of it. My friend the Australian foreign minister was drawn into the fray. He phoned me. We decided to cool things down... When the whole episode was over I sent a bouquet of flowers to my Australian counterpart. Flowers are also for sissies." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 Nina Shatskaya {{went to the}} USA {{with a view of}} {{recording}} her Russian romances. [...] "Investors hoped that there would be some kind of a romance revival. They wanted to make a high-budget product involving the leading Russian poets and composers. But producer Maksim Dunayevsky decided to make it a pop record and since I've never been keen on pop music, the project flopped," [...] she later explained. The recorded material was taken back to Russia but remained unreleased. [...] "I was well aware that the material we recorded was primitive and had nothing whatsoever to do with what I'd been dreaming of. I felt like I'd been given one chance and squandered it," [...] she later admitted. She spent in America six months and spoke warmly of her vocal coach Seth Riggs. [...] "When I first came to him, he was jovially dismissive of the Russian vocal school. Having heard me he was impressed and <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> brilliant technique, for which I have to thank Natalya Andrianova," [...] the singer recalled.|$|E
2500|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by Wilson, who intended to encapsulate {{the feel of the}} Drifters' version of [...] "On Broadway". The instrumental was made on April 6, 1965 at United Western Recorders, requiring 44 takes before Wilson could deem a satisfactory performance. Problems had arisen from the tempo and guitar part in the introduction, which fatigued Wilson, engineer Chuck Britz, and the dozen-plus session players. The song did not appear to have lyrics or a title at this juncture, and Wilson can be heard calling the song [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] and [...] "You're Grass and I'm a Power Mower". Wilson remembers: [...] "When we got into the studio with Chuck, he said that he wanted Carl’s twelve-string guitar in the intro to sound more direct. I didn’t know what that meant. 'Can he play it in the booth?' Chuck <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never thought about that before, but {{it seemed like a good}} idea. Carl was standing next to me in the booth and all the other musicians were out in the studio. I conducted it like an orchestra." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 1, 2013, {{after months}} of {{speculation}} dating back to {{before the start of}} the season, Greater Western Sydney shocked the football public by withdrawing their offer of $1.2 million per year for six years, announcing that they were of the belief that Franklin was set to sign with the Sydney Swans. The Sydney Swans' chairman, Andrew Ireland, said later that day that the contract offered to Franklin was a nine-year deal worth $10 million, and that Franklin's management first approached the Swans about the move shortly after the 2012 AFL Grand Final, when Franklin played in a losing side against the Swans. The next day, Franklin said that he did not make his decision to move to Sydney [...] "until the last minute". He also said, [...] "I'm looking forward to getting up to Sydney. It's a great footy club and, as I <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to pack my bags up at Hawthorn and saying goodbye to the boys is something very tough, and upsetting, too". Franklin's manager, Liam Pickering, also revealed that the nine-year contract was so back-ended that he would be making less money with the Swans in 2014–15 than he was at Hawthorn in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966 Brett {{successfully}} {{applied to}} be a music journalist at pop music weekly, Go-Set, and in May she replaced founding feature writer, Doug Panther. She later reflected, [...] "My career is inexplicable and it's a career path that nobody should follow! It basically starts with an 18-year old refusing {{to go to}} university {{because that was the}} one thing that my parents wanted of me, that and to be slim. So I defied both of those desires. My mother <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to get a job, which shocked me. There was a new newspaper opening up in Australia called Go-Set and I walked into the office and I started work the next day. I don't think this would happen today." [...] The paper's editor was Tony Schauble, and according to Go-Set staff photographer, Colin Beard, [...] " [...] had been to see Schauble several times and had made a favourable impression on him and more importantly, she had a car, which was an attractive incentive to employ her." [...] Fellow writers included Vince Lovegrove, Molly Meldrum, Ed Nimmervoll and Stan Rofe. In November 1966 Brett was interviewed on The Go!! Show, a Victorian-based pop music show, by its host, Johnny Young (also a pop singer). Young described Brett's style [...] "She seemed genuinely interested in the pop stars she interviewed, but she could also be intimidating at times." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ryun {{participated in}} the 1964, 1968, and 1972 Summer Olympics. At age 17 years, 137 days in 1964, he remains the {{youngest}} American male track athlete to ever qualify for the Olympics. In 1968, he won the silver medal in the 1,500 meters in Mexico City, losing to Kip Keino from Kenya, whose remarkable race remained the Olympic 1,500-meter record for 16 years. Before the race, Ryun had thought that a time of 3:39 would {{be good enough to}} win in the high altitude of Mexico City. He ended up running faster than that with a 3:37.8, but Keino's 3:34.9 was too tough to beat at that altitude. Keino moved into the first position with two laps to go (800 meters) at world record pace. Ryun continued to move up during the last two laps from eighth to second but was never closer than about 30 yards from Keino. Years later, in 1981, he told Tex Maule in an interview for The Runner magazine, [...] "We had thought that 3:39 would win and I ran under that. I considered it like winning a gold medal; I had done my very best and I still believe I would have won at sea level." [...] Ryun was attacked by some writers who believed he had let his nation down. [...] "Some even <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> let down the whole world. I didn't get any credit for running my best and no one seemed to realize that Keino had performed brilliantly." [...] In the 1972 Munich, Germany, Games, he was tripped and fell down during a 1,500-meter qualifying heat. Although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) acknowledged that a foul had occurred, U.S. appeals to have Ryun reinstated in the competition were denied by the IOC.|$|E
