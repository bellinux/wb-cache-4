However, incorporation of software security in lightweight approaches can be difficult. Using <b>security</b> testing <b>techniques</b> throughout a complete agile development process by running automated tests in continuous integration environments is one approach that strives to improve security in agile projects. Instead of performing security testing {{at the end of}} the development cycle, such methods enables early and continuous detection of security risks and vulnerabilities. The purpose of this thesis is to study how existing <b>security</b> testing <b>techniques</b> operate in continuous integration environments and what level of security they can help assure. The work is a qualitative analysis of dierent <b>security</b> testing <b>techniques</b> and evaluates how they technically fit into a continuous integration environment as well as how they adhere to agile principles. These techniques are also analyzed with the use of OWASP Top Ten to determine which security requirements they can verify. The outcome of the analysis is that no existing <b>security</b> testing <b>technique</b> is a perfect fit for usage in continuous integration testing. Each technique has its distinct advantages and drawbacks that should be taken into consideration when choosing a technique to work with in continuous integration environments. ...|$|R
