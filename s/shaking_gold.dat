50|$|The tale {{begins with}} two will-o'-the-wisps who wake a ferryman {{and ask to}} be taken across a river. The ferryman does so, and for payment, they <b>shake</b> <b>gold</b> from {{themselves}} into the boat. This alarms the ferryman, for if the gold {{had gone into the}} river, it would overflow. He demands as payment: three artichokes, three cabbages, and three onions, and the will-o'-the-wisps may depart only after promising to bring him such. The ferryman takes the gold up to a high place, and deposits it into a rocky cleft, where it is discovered by a green snake who eats the gold, and finds itself luminous. This gives the snake opportunity to study an underground temple where we meet an old man with a lamp which can only give light when another light is present. The snake now investigates the temple, and finds four kings: one gold, one silver, one bronze, and one a mixture of all three.|$|R
60|$|Siegmund {{looked at}} the <b>shaking</b> flood of <b>gold</b> and paling gold spread wider as the night upraised the {{blanching}} crystal, poured out farther and farther the immense libation from the whitening cup, till at last the moon looked frail and empty.|$|R
60|$|A little quiver {{ran through}} her, causing her dress to <b>shake</b> and the <b>gold</b> Mexican gods on her {{necklace}} to tinkle against each other. Then she grew {{still as a}} stone, and raising those large and steady eyes of hers, looked him up and down, finally fixing them upon his own.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is what {{is called}} an {{affinity}} between quicksilver and gold. The moment gold touches quicksilver it is absorbed by it, just as {{a drop of water}} is taken up by a lump of salt. It thickens the quicksilver, and as it is squeezed through the leather the quicksilver is as it were strained out, and what remains behind becomes thicker and thicker, until, as you see, it is almost solid. It is no good to use more pressure, for if you do a certain amount of the gold would be squeezed through the leather. You see, as the stuff in the cradle is <b>shaken,</b> the <b>gold</b> being heavier than the sand finds its way down to the bottom, and every particle that comes in contact with the quicksilver is swallowed up by it." ...|$|R
50|$|Gold panning {{is mostly}} a manual {{technique}} of separating gold from other materials. Wide, shallow pans are filled with sand and gravel that may contain gold. The pan is submerged in water and <b>shaken,</b> sorting the <b>gold</b> from the gravel and other material. As gold is much denser than rock, it quickly settles {{to the bottom of}} the pan. The panning material is usually removed from stream beds, often at the inside turn in the stream, or from the bedrock shelf of the stream, where the density of gold allows it to concentrate, a type called placer deposits.|$|R
60|$|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek {{remained}} quiet. A {{sprinkling of}} men had staked; {{but most of}} them, after staking, had gone on down to Forty Mile and Circle City. The few that possessed sufficient faith to remain were busy building log cabins against the coming of winter. Carmack and his Indian relatives were occupied in building a sluice box and getting a head of water. The work was slow, for they had to saw their lumber by hand from the standing forest. But farther down Bonanza were four men who had drifted in from up river, Dan McGilvary, Dave McKay, Dave Edwards, and Harry Waugh. They were a quiet party, neither asking nor giving confidences, and they herded by themselves. But Daylight, who had panned the spotted rim of Carmack's claim and <b>shaken</b> coarse <b>gold</b> from the grass-roots, and who had panned the rim at a hundred other places {{up and down the}} length of the creek and found nothing, was curious to know what lay on bed-rock. He had noted the four quiet men sinking a shaft close by the stream, and he had heard their whip-saw going as they made lumber for the sluice boxes. He did not wait for an invitation, but he was present the first day they sluiced. And at the end of five hours' shovelling for one man, he saw them take out thirteen ounces and a half of gold.|$|R
500|$|In April 2010, Harvey {{appeared}} on The Andrew Marr Show {{to perform a}} new song titled [...] "Let England Shake." [...] In a pre-performance interview with Marr, she stated that the new material she had written had been [...] "formed out of the landscape that I've grown up in {{and the history of}} this nation" [...] and as [...] "a human being affected by politics." [...] Her eighth studio album Let England Shake was released in February 2011, and received universal critical acclaim. NMEs 10/10 review summarised the album as [...] "a record that ventures deep into the heart of darkness of war itself and its resonance throughout England's past, present and future" [...] and other reviews also noted its themes and writing style as [...] "bloody and forceful," [...] mixing [...] "ethereal form with brutal content," [...] and [...] "her most powerful." [...] Dealing with the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and other episodes from English history, the album featured John Parish, Mick Harvey and Jean-Marc Butty as Harvey's backing band and the quartet toured extensively in its promotion. Following the release of the album's two well-received singles — [...] "The Words That Maketh Murder" [...] and [...] "The Glorious Land" [...] — and the collection of short films by Seamus Murphy to accompany the album, Harvey won her second Mercury Music Prize on 6 September. The award marked her as the first artist to receive the award twice, entering her into The Guinness Book Of Records as the only artist to have achieved this., and sales of Let England Shake increased 1,190% overnight following her win. On 23 September, Let England <b>Shake</b> was certified <b>Gold</b> in the United Kingdom and was listed as album of the year by MOJO and Uncut.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he is odd-looking; {{but what}} is odder still is that I have seen him before, that his face is {{familiar}} to me, and yet that I can't place him." [...] The orchestra was playing the Prayer from Der Freischutz, but Weber's lovely music only deepened the blank of memory. Who the deuce was he? where, when, how, had I known him? It seemed extraordinary that a face should be at once so familiar and so strange. We had our backs turned to him, so that I could not look at him again. When the music ceased we left our places, and I went to consign my friend to her mamma on the terrace. In passing, I saw that my young man had departed; I concluded that he only strikingly resembled some one I knew. But {{who in the world}} was it he resembled? The ladies went off to their lodgings, which were near by, and I turned into the gaming-rooms and hovered about the circle at roulette. Gradually I filtered through to the inner edge, near the table, and, looking round, saw my puzzling friend stationed opposite to me. He was watching the game, with his hands in his pockets; but singularly enough, now that I observed him at my leisure, the look of familiarity quite faded from his face. What had made us call his appearance odd was his great length and leanness of limb, his long, white neck, his blue, prominent eyes, and his ingenuous, unconscious absorption in the scene before him. He was not handsome, certainly, but he looked peculiarly amiable and if his overt wonderment savoured a trifle of rurality, it was an agreeable contrast to the hard, inexpressive masks about him. He was the verdant offshoot, I said to myself, of some ancient, rigid stem; he had been brought up in the quietest of homes, and he was having his first glimpse of life. I was curious to see whether he would put anything on the table; he evidently felt the temptation, but he seemed paralysed by chronic embarrassment. He stood gazing at the chinking complexity of losses and gains, <b>shaking</b> his loose <b>gold</b> in his pocket, {{and every now and then}} passing his hand nervously over his eyes.|$|R
