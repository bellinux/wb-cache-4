5|$|The American Dream, or the {{perception}} that Americans enjoy high social mobility, {{plays a key role}} in attracting immigrants. Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate. While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society, scholars identify <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values. Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree. While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.|$|E
5|$|Whilst Bowlby's early {{writings}} on maternal deprivation {{may be seen}} as part of the background to the later development of attachment theory, there are many <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two. At the time of the 1951 publication, there was little research in this area and no comprehensive theory on the development of early relationships. Aside from its central proposition of the importance of an early, continuous and sensitive relationship, the monograph concentrates mostly on social policy. For his subsequent development of attachment theory, Bowlby drew on concepts from ethology, cybernetics, information processing, developmental psychology and psychoanalysis. The first early formal statements of attachment theory were presented in three papers in 1958, 1959 and 1960. His major work Attachment was published in three volumes between 1969 and 1980. Attachment theory revolutionised thinking on the nature of early attachments and extensive research continues to be undertaken.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{academic}} achievement and social adjustment of mentally retarded students who have had five years of special education with mentally retarded students who have had no special education. This comparison was made to determine if there is a <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups. The present study was not undertaken to defend or attack special education classes. The study was designed to determine to what extent academic and social <b>differences</b> existed <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups. It is hoped the results of this study can be used in planning programs for the educable mentally retarded children in the Weber County Schools. The writer proposes the following hypotheses: 1. There will be no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups in reading. 2. There will be no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups in arithmetic. 3. There will be no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups in language. 4. There will be no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups in attitude toward school. 5. There will be no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups as evaluated by their teachers. Data concerning these problems were collected from standardized tests from teacher-appraised school adjustment rating scale, and from school records...|$|R

25|$|When an EUV photon is absorbed, photoelectrons and {{secondary}} electrons are generated by ionization, much like {{what happens when}} X-rays or electron beams are absorbed by matter. 10 mJ/cm2 EUV photon dose results in the generation of 109 uC/cm2 dose of photoelectrons. The more highly absorbing resist removes more light {{in the top of}} the resist, leaving less for the bottom of the resist. The larger absorption leads to larger, more <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> absorbed doses at the top and the bottom of the resist.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, LeVay {{published}} {{a study of}} 41 autopsies on 16 heterosexual men, 19 homosexual men, and 6 heterosexual women that targeted the interstitial nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH 1, 2, 3, and 4). He showed {{that there were no}} <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> three groups' INAH 1, 2, and 4, which prior research already showed. However, INAH 3 was larger in heterosexual men in comparison to homosexual men and heterosexual women.

25|$|A 1967 study where a judge {{randomly}} assigned (ordered) offenders to either clinical treatment, AA treatment, or to a no treatment (control) group. After one year 68% {{in the clinic}} group were rearrested, 69% in the AA group were rearrested, and 56% were rearrested in the group receiving no treatment. No statistically <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> three groups were discovered in recidivism rate, {{in the number of}} subsequent rearrests or in time elapsed prior to rearrest. Like the Brandsma study, the results are inaccurate since the studies did not stop people not assigned to AA treatment from going to AA meetings.|$|E
25|$|Candytuft {{was ordered}} 25 July 1942 {{as part of}} the Royal Navy 1942-43 Increased Endurance Flower-class {{building}} program. She was laid down 27 February 1943 by A. & J. Inglis Ltd. at Glasgow, Scotland and launched 28 September 1943. As part of an exchange for s that the RCN intended to use as convoy escorts, the Royal Navy transferred four Flower-class corvettes and twelve s to Canada in order to acquire them. Candytuft was transferred on 5 January 1944 and commissioned as HMCS Long Branch into the RCN at Tobermory, Mull. The only <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> RCN and RN 1942-43 Flower classes was a shortened mainmast and varying anti-aircraft armament.|$|E

30|$|Further, we did {{not find}} a {{statistically}} <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> evaluation and prediction phases for both groups of datasets (72 and 202). This means that the results reported by the genetic framework were very similar and reliable. We did not find a statistically <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> exhaustive framework analyzed and the mutations (0.01, 0.033 and 0.1). The mutation with the best performance was 0.033. We did not find a statistically <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> exhaustive framework analyzed and the crossovers (0.6 and 0.7) except (0.9). The crossovers with the best performance were 0.6 and 0.7. This mean that our genetic approach is stable between different configurations and we can make the model’s predictions use less computational resources.|$|R

25|$|There are <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two Talmud compilations. The {{language}} of the Jerusalem Talmud is a Western Aramaic dialect, which differs from the form of Aramaic in the Babylonian Talmud. The Jerusalem Talmud is often fragmentary and difficult to read, even for experienced Talmudists. The redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, on the other hand, is more careful and precise. The law as laid down in the two compilations is basically similar, except in emphasis and in minor details. The Jerusalem Talmud has not received much attention from commentators, and such traditional commentaries as exist are mostly concerned with comparing its teachings {{to those of the}} Babylonian Talmud.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, Talbot {{applied for}} an {{extension}} of the 14-year patent. At that time, one of his lawsuits, against photographer Martin Laroche, was heard in court. The Talbot v. Laroche case proved to be pivotal. Laroche's side argued that the patent was invalid, as a similar process had been invented earlier by Joseph Reade, and that using the collodion process did not infringe the calotype patent in any case, because of <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two processes. In the verdict, the jury upheld the calotype patent but agreed that Laroche was not infringing upon it by using the collodion process. Disappointed by the outcome, Talbot chose not to extend his patent.|$|E
25|$|To {{return to}} the Original Imitation Game, he states only that player A is to be {{replaced}} with a machine, not that player C is to {{be made aware of}} this replacement. When Colby, FD Hilf, S Weber and AD Kramer tested PARRY, they did so by assuming that the interrogators did not need to know that one or more of those being interviewed was a computer during the interrogation. As Ayse Saygin, Peter Swirski, and others have highlighted, this makes a big difference to the implementation and outcome of the test. An experimental study looking at Gricean maxim violations using transcripts of Loebner's one-to-one (interrogator-hidden interlocutor) Prize for AI contests between 1994–1999, Ayse Saygin found <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> responses of participants who knew and did not know about computers being involved.|$|E
