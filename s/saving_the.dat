40|$|In this diploma thesis I {{have dealt}} with the {{description}} of the most significant public expenditures, mandatory expenditures. I have focused on building <b>savings,</b> <b>the</b> state support for building <b>savings</b> and <b>the</b> profitableness of building savings as a whole. In {{the first part of the}} work, different types of public expenditures are defined and categorized; you may also find there a definition of mandatory expenditures. This section also contains the historical development of building <b>savings</b> to <b>the</b> current form and the development of the basic indicators of building <b>savings</b> in <b>the</b> Czech Republic. Another part is devoted to legislative regulation of building savings; this section also contains the development of the state support and its impact on the state budget. The third, analytical part contains an analysis of microeconomic benefits and macroeconomic consequences for the economy. In this part I analyze the profitability of <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> phase and <b>the</b> cost of credit phase of <b>the</b> building <b>savings,</b> compared with <b>the</b> selected alternative products. At the end of this chapter I will try to offer a picture of the possible forms of <b>the</b> building <b>savings</b> in <b>the</b> future...|$|R
50|$|<b>Savings</b> reduce <b>the</b> funds {{available}} to consumers and investment income increases those funds. The MONIAC showed this by draining water (<b>savings)</b> from <b>the</b> expenditure stream and by injecting water (investment income) into that stream. When <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> flow exceeds <b>the</b> investment flow, {{the level of}} water in <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> and investment tank (the surplus-balances tank) would rise to reflect the accumulated balance. When the investment flow exceeds <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> flow {{for any length of}} time, the surplus-balances tank would run dry. Import and export were represented by water draining from the model, and by additional water being poured into the model.|$|R

5|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1835 his native {{province}} of Rio Grande do Sul was engulfed in a secessionist rebellion, the Ragamuffin War.

He played a decisive role in <b>saving</b> <b>the</b> provincial capital from the Ragamuffin rebels, allowing forces loyal to the legitimate government to secure a key foothold. In 1852, he led a Brazilian division during the Platine War in an invasion of the Argentine Confederation that overthrew its dictator. He was awarded a noble title, eventually raised from baron to viscount and finally to count.|$|E
