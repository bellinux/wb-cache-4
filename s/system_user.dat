5|$|Adventures of Mana is {{a remake}} of the 1991 Game Boy game Final Fantasy Adventure, {{which was the first}} entry in the Mana series. It is the second remake of Final Fantasy Adventure, the first being the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana, which had removed the {{connections}} to the Final Fantasy series in favor of being more connected {{to the rest of the}} Mana series. According to Adventures of Manas producer, Masaru Oyamada, the development team focused on not upsetting what had made the original game good, while adding things that had not been possible to do in the original version due to hardware limitations; they also aimed to make the game more comfortable and intuitive to play: for instance, switching armor and weapons and using items and magic was made easier, and shortcut commands were added. The game borrows some elements from the original Game Boy version, and some from Sword of Mana. For example, the first remake introduced the ability to play as the heroine, but Adventures of Mana, like the original, only has a male playable character; conversely Adventures of Manas battle <b>system,</b> <b>user</b> interface and sword attack are based on Sword of Manas rather than the original's. Kenji Ito, the composer for Final Fantasy Adventure, returned to create updated and more dramatic rearrangements for the remake.|$|E

25|$|The line is {{monitored}} from the Operations Control Center (OCC). Responsibility for controlling service {{is shared by}} the control room and field personnel along the right of way. Track circuit and signal indications are not transmitted to the operational personnel sites. In lieu of track circuit indications, the AVI system is displayed {{in the control room}} to provide a periodic update to train position wherever AVI detectors exist. The AVI <b>system</b> <b>user</b> interface was solely text based until the current control room was opened, in which a new schematic display based on AVI data was instituted. Track circuit indications are available digitally in signal houses at the Park Street interlocking, at the new North Station interlocking, and at the new Kenmore interlocking, but are not transmitted to OCC. In January 2013, the MBTA announced plans to add full vehicle location tracking on the Green Line for countdown signs and smartphone applications, including using AVI data in the tunnels and GPS receivers on the surface lines. The first real-time data—location data on the surface lines—became available in October 2014. Full tracking is expected by early 2015.|$|E

Scripts and functions operate analogously with cmdlets, in that they can be used as commands in pipelines, and parameters can be bound to them. Pipeline objects can be passed between functions, scripts, and cmdlets seamlessly. To prevent unintentional running of scripts, script execution is disabled by default and must be enabled explicitly. Enabling of scripts can be performed either at <b>system,</b> <b>user</b> or session level. PowerShell scripts can be signed to verify their integrity, and are subject to Code Access Security.|$|E
