Therefore, in these growingly used processes the transverse permeability of the fabrics will control both manufacturing cycles and dimensions, and consequently the mechanical properties of the nal composites. A big eort has been realized to obtain reliable experimental techniques for measuring the transverse permeability. Since the dierentiation between saturated and eective permeabilities is still discussed, and the flow front is hardly dened in such small dimensions (order of 1 mm), our measurements on some so-called Non-Crimped New Concept (NC 2) are carried out for saturated flow, i. e. the ber network is completely impregnated from the onset of the experiment. In our case [1], these measures rely on the measurements of the pressure drop induced by the flow of a controlled liqui across the fabrics, easily converted into transverse permeability through the Darcy's law. One of the main results of these measurements is that the low NC 2 transverse permeability depends {{on the face of the}} fabric receiving the liquid. This original behaviour may, in turn, be translated into manufacturing guidelines to achieve optimal processing conguration. An attempt to relate this dierential to the <b>stitching</b> <b>hole</b> surface is proposed which turns to explain minor phenomena. On the contrary, the 3 D shape of the <b>stitching</b> <b>hole</b> reconstruction from polishings could yield some proper explanations...|$|E

5000|$|In 2011, Kemp and Pascal Cotte {{reported}} that there was evidence that the drawing had once {{been part of a}} copy in the National Library of Poland in Warsaw of the Sforziada. [...] This is a printed book with hand-illuminated additions containing a long propagandistic poem in praise of the father of Ludovico Sforza, who was Leonardo’s patron, recounting the career. The Warsaw copy, printed on vellum with added illumination, was given to Galeazzo Sanseverino, a military commander under Ludovico Sforza, on his marriage to Bianca Sforza in 1496. Kemp and Cotte identified where two sheets were missing from this volume from which they believe the drawing was cut.

40|$|A {{piece of}} unusual fabric that is shiny black {{on one side}} and red-brown on the other laid {{unidentified}} among the Chinese textiles in the University of Rhode Island (URI) Historic Textile and Costume Collection for over half a century. Abby Lillethun’s interest in analyzing mud silks brought this cloth, identified as Xiang-yun-shā, from obscurity to notoriety. Its most obvious feature is the two-colored surfaces created by first dyeing the fabric and then coating one side with black mud as described in the preceding papers by Lillethun and Lin. The selvage of the URI fabric, seen from the backside in figure 1, has some iron-rich mud along the edge and some <b>stitching</b> <b>holes</b> from a previous use. The geometric leno-weave pattern creates a key design with a little openness in the structure. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) photomicrograph in figure 2 shows some open spaces {{on either side of the}} diverted warps of the leno weave that run diagonally across the picture. This backside of the fabric has some mud deposits, but the black front side that is in figure 3 has a heavy coating of mud that covers the yarns completely. The treated fabric does not need to be beaten or calendared; the dried surface of the mud is quite shiny. The textile’s hand is firm and somewhat stiff. A similarly colored plain-weave fabric makes up a contemporary pair of pants designed with the black side facing out except at the waistband, which has the brown dyed side exposed (pictured in Lillethun article). This newer fabric, which is named Jiāo-chou and could be up to 80 years younger than the URI fabric, has a lighter deposit of mud (Fig. 4), but still has a crisp hand. The mud coating contains carbon, silicon, calcium, iron, and aluminum—not an unusual combination of materials for mud and the same composition as the other coatings analyzed for this report...|$|R

We show that an optical fiber sensor with these designs can covenanting allow the measuring the force/stress ap plied to a mechanical structure or which it is linked, by optimizing the uses of appropriate materials for constituting the sensor support. The experiment that we introduce to validate our approach based in principles includes design with a support bearing a multimode optical fiber organized {{in such a way}} that the transmitted light is attenuated when the fi ber-bending angle coming from <b>stitching</b> in <b>holes</b> of the support is modified by the effects of the force/stress applied to the optical fiber sensor realized in this way.

5000|$|Some {{people think}} that a kilt pin could damage a kilt. As President of the Scottish Society (1914), Loudon MacQueen Douglas, point outs, a [...] "claw brooch" [...] (a popular style made from an animal claw) is easily caught on a lady's dress while dancing {{potentially}} damaging both the dress and the kilts. A precaution can be taken in applying buttonhole <b>stitching</b> around the <b>hole</b> where the kilt pin goes into the cloth. This strengthens the cloth so that tearing is less likely. Placing a piece of leather behind the front apron and attaching the Kilt Pin through the cloth and the leather could also {{reduce the likelihood of}} tearing.|$|R
50|$|Tent fabric {{may be made}} of many {{materials}} including cotton (canvas), nylon, {{felt and}} polyester. Cotton absorbs water, so it can become very heavy when wet, but the associated swelling tends to block any minute holes so that wet cotton is more waterproof than dry cotton. Cotton tents were often treated with paraffin to enhance water resistance. Nylon and polyester are much lighter than cotton and do not absorb much water; with suitable coatings {{they can be very}} waterproof, but they tend to deteriorate over time due to a slow chemical breakdown caused by ultraviolet light. The most common treatments to make fabric waterproof are silicone impregnation or polyurethane coating. Since <b>stitching</b> makes tiny <b>holes</b> in a fabric seams are often sealed or taped to block these holes and maintain waterproofness, though in practice a carefully sewn seam can be waterproof.|$|R

40|$|Current {{methods for}} {{combining}} two different images produce visible artifacts when the sources {{have very different}} textures and structures. We present a new method for synthesizing a transition region between two source images, such that inconsistent color, texture, and structural properties all change gradually from one source to the other. We call this process image melding. Our method builds upon a patch-based optimization foundation with three key generalizations: First, we enrich the patch search space with additional geometric and photometric transformations. Second, we integrate image gradients into the patch representation and replace the usual color averaging with a screened Poisson equation solver. And third, we propose a new energy based on mixed L 2 /L 0 norms for colors and gradients that produces a gradual transition between sources without sacrificing texture sharpness. Together, all three generalizations enable patch-based solutions to a broad class of image melding problems involving inconsistent sources: object cloning, <b>stitching</b> challenging panoramas, <b>hole</b> filling from multiple photos, and image harmonization. In several cases, our unified method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for those applications...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the sight, sound, smell and touch of different cloth-types in the Late Ertebølle of southern Scandinavia and to argue that such an approach provides stimulating new insights into an area of material culture that has previously been studied by archaeologists in a highly empirical manner. The archaeological evidence drawn together in this paper points to this as a time when furs and skin products were of prime importance and plant fibres were the basis for knotted nets, looped cloth and basketry. In the archaeological literature these cloth-types are usually treated separately and described according to the species of raw materials, such as pine marten fur, or the technology of their production, such as couched button <b>hole</b> <b>stitch.</b> Using an experiment where participants are asked to handle modern cloth-types and answer structured questionnaires, it is possible to create a sensory description of these cloth-types. These descriptive results are then used to reconsider aspects of cloth and clothing in the Late Ertebølle of southern Scandinavia. By moving from the standard technological description to a sensory description, the Mesolithic cloth types investigated in this paper are placed within a sensory and phenomenological theoretical framework. The presentation of these results seeks to provide a new description of these materials and allow archaeologists to revaluate the culturally embedded nature of cloth and clothing at that time...|$|R

Once the videophone is fixed, Lilo contacts the BRB-9000. Leroy impersonates Stitch, using shape-shifting to disguise himself, but fails {{because he does not}} have Stitch's tiki necklace. Hämsterviel then commands Leroy to go to Earth and capture all of the other experiments to destroy them. Lilo, sensing Stitch is in trouble, asks Reuben for help in fixing Gantu's ship. As Jumba, Pleakley, and Stitch head towards the black <b>hole,</b> <b>Stitch</b> escapes and frees the others. However, the navigational computer is locked on course for the black hole and will teleport them to a volcanic planet where they will be vaporized, but if they can disrupt the event horizon by throwing a small object into the black hole, it will send them somewhere else. Pleakley pulls out the rock that Lilo gave him and asks if this will work. After Jumba says it is too heavy, Stitch takes a bite out of it, then crawls out the front of the vehicle and throws it at the black hole. There is a flash and the vehicle is sucked in.|$|R
50|$|Adrift in {{deep space}} with a rapidly {{diminishing}} oxygen supply, Abelard Snazz is cryogenically preserved after a passing meteor ruptures his space suit’s thermostat and freezes his body. Two thousand years later, a passing race of morose, Viking-like beings, the Farbians, rescue Snazz and bring him and the corroded remains of Edwin aboard their ship. After Snazz is defrosted and gets his bearings, he gleefully disposes of Edwin’s remains via the ship’s garbage disposal chute. The Farbians take Snazz back to their home planet, Farbus. The Farbians believe that Snazz is a god-like being, the “Toglub of the Two-Fold Gaze,” and worship him accordingly. They also inform Snazz {{that he is the}} fulfillment of a prophecy - that the Toglub has been sent to deliver Farbus from three major calamities: their economic crisis, caused by the “Farbian Crottle” weed killing all their vegetation; their energy crisis, caused by a lack of fuel; and the crisis of a black hole’s imminent approach to the planet. Snazz is duly informed that, should the Toglub fail to solve these three problems in a single stroke, he will be thrown to the Piranha-Dogs. After much thought, Snazz discovers that the Farbian Crottle is overrun and fed on by the intelligent “Farbian Crottle-Worms” - “the most saintly and good-natured beings in known space.” Snazz creates a “virtue converter” to transform the worms’ good thoughts into an unlimited supply of energy - thus solving the energy crisis. Snazz theorises that other races will want to harness this source of energy, and the Farbians can sell abundant supplies of Farbian Crottle to them - thus solving the economic crisis. As for the black hole, Snazz comes {{up with the idea of}} <b>stitching</b> up the <b>hole</b> with a thread-like stream of “cohesive neutrinos” from a faster-than-light spaceship, piloted by himself and powered by Farbian Crottle-Worms. This plan initially works, until the Farbians praise the worms. An enraged Snazz declares that all the thanks should go to him, and that the worms are merely a bunch of “do-gooder maggots” and “mindless invertebrates.” The worms are so insulted that they lose their good thoughts, and thus the ship loses power - and is sucked into the black hole.|$|R
40|$|Current {{methods for}} {{combining}} different images produce visible artifacts when the sources {{have very different}} textures and structures, come from far view points, or capture dynamic scenes with motions. In this thesis, we propose a patch-based synthesis algorithm to plausibly combine different images that have color, texture, structural, and geometric inconsistencies. For some applications such as cloning and stitching where a gradual blend is required, we present a new method for synthesizing a transition region between two source images, such that inconsistent properties change gradually from one source to the other. We call this process image melding. For gradual blending, we generalized patch-based optimization foundation with three key generalizations: First, we enrich the patch search space with additional geometric and photometric transformations. Second, we integrate image gradients into the patch representation and replace the usual color averaging with a screened Poisson equation solver. Third, we propose a new energy based on mixed L 2 /L 0 norms for colors and gradients that produces a gradual transition between sources without sacrificing texture sharpness. Together, all three generalizations enable patch-based solutions to a broad class of image melding problems involving inconsistent sources: object cloning, <b>stitching</b> challenging panoramas, <b>hole</b> filling from multiple photos, and image harmonization. We also demonstrate another application which requires us to address inconsistencies across the images: high dynamic range (HDR) reconstruction using sequential exposures. In this application, the results will suffer from objectionable artifacts for dynamic scenes if the inconsistencies caused by significant scene motions are not handled properly. In this thesis, we propose {{a new approach to}} HDR reconstruction that uses information in all exposures while being more robust to motion than previous techniques. Our algorithm is based on a novel patch-based energy-minimization formulation that integrates alignment and reconstruction in a joint optimization through an equation we call the HDR image synthesis equation. This allows us to produce an HDR result that is aligned to one of the exposures yet contains information from all of them. These two applications (image melding and high dynamic range reconstruction) show that patch based methods like the one proposed in this dissertation can address inconsistent images and could open the door to many new image editing applications in the future.
