40|$|This thesis {{evaluated}} hazards from subaerial (originating {{above sea}} level) landslide-induced tsunamis in Knight Inlet and Howe Sound. Field assessments were conducted at Adeane Point and Mount Gardner. GIS was used at site and inlet scales to compile existing map data, to map submarine slide deposits, to measure topographic parameters, and to integrate observations. Modelling at Adeane Point employed kinematic, limit equilibrium (<b>SWEDGE)</b> and discrete element (3 DEC) analyses {{in order to}} estimate the volume of a potential landslide. Results suggest that the hazard from subaerial slide-induced waves is high in Knight Inlet, particularly in the area between Adeane Point and Glacier Bay, whereas, when compared with Knight Inlet, the hazard in Howe Sound appears considerably less. Modelling results suggest that topography and discontinuity persistence are the leading controls on failure volume. A preliminary catalogue of techniques for assessing hazards from slide waves was created, and related issues were discussed...|$|E
40|$|Probabilistic {{analysis}} {{is widely used}} in slope stability assessment because of its capability {{to take into account}} uncertainties associated with geotechnical parameters. There are, however, still many unresolved practical issues to the application of the method. One of these issues is the integration of assessments when multiple sets of fractures are considered for the entire slope. In the present study, this issue is addressed within the framework of Monte Carlo simulation. Probability of failure for pairs of fracture sets are assessed independently and the final assessment of the probability of failure for the entire slope is done using conditional probabilities. Prominent Hill open pit, in particular, the problematic fresh Bulldog shale formation, was used as a case study to test the method proposed. The <b>SWEDGE</b> program of the RocScience software package was used for the analysis. C. Xu, M. Karakus, N. Melkoumian, C. Wang, Q. Sui, J. Wang, Q. Qian and D. Goodchild[URL]...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the engineering geological characteristics of rock {{mass in the}} headrace tunnel, powerhouse, and intake portal of the Kankai Hydroelectric Project. The project area lies in the Lower Siwaliks of east Nepal and consists of alternating sandstone and mudstone beds with frequent siltstone intercalations. The rock mass of the project area was classified according to rock mass rating (RMR) and rock mass quality index (Q) systems. It is of very poor, poor, to fair quality (categories V, IV, and III) in the headrace tunnel; of very poor quality (category V) in the powerhouse; and of fair quality (category III) in the intake portal. The stability analysis of irregularly jointed and fractured rocks of the area was carried out using <b>SWEDGE</b> and UNWEDGE. The analysis gave the safety factor of 0. 45, 0. 64, and 0. 45, respectively for the powerhouse, intake portal, and headrace tunnel. The final safety factors obtained after the installation of support for powerhouse, intake portal, and headrace tunnel were 1. 14, 3. 33, and 4. 53, respectively...|$|E
2500|$|In musical {{instrument}} repair the usual term {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic is <b>swedging,</b> not swaging, though it is generally acknowledged that the former derives from the latter. Keyed instruments such as the clarinet, bassoon, oboe and flute need <b>swedging</b> when years of key movement has worn or compressed the metal of the hinge tube they swivel on and made it slightly shorter, so that the key can travel along the rod it is mounted on instead of being held firmly between the posts attaching the rod to the body of the instrument. [...] This gives rise to floppy keys and a poor air-seal and needs to be corrected by lengthening (<b>swedging)</b> the hinge tube. This is a job that needs to be done by hand, and <b>swedging</b> pliers with highly polished oval holes in the jaws to fit common sizes of hinge tubes are often used to achieve this, though various proprietary designs of <b>swedging</b> tools are available to do the same job more efficiently.|$|R

Now how the deuce am I to tell Hurree Babu, and whatt the deuce am I to do? And {{my old man}} is sick. I must tie up the letters in oilskin. That is something to do first--else they will get all sweated ... And I am all alone!' He bound them into a neat packet, <b>swedging</b> down the stiff, sticky oilskin at the comers, for his roving life had made him as methodical as an old hunter in matters of the road.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{probabilistic}} approach for the slope safety factor calculation that uses kinematic and kinetic instability assessment of wedge failures affecting an unstable sea-cliff. The cliff, located at Agropoli (province of Salerno, Campania) along a coastal stretch of Southern Italy, is about 240 m long with height ranging between 10 and 55 m. Detailed geological, geo-structural and geo-mechanical surveys were performed in situ, whereas joint and rock strength parameters were measured in the laboratory. Wedge failures are the most frequent episodic phenomena favoured by the geo-structural and geomechanical layout of the rock mass, and subordinately the assailing force of waves. Based on {{the orientation of the}} discontinuities, with respect to the cliff face, the main joint set intersections which may cause potential unstable wedges have been identified. As during heavy sea storms, wave energy may contribute to cliff instability, and also an in-depth study regarding wave characteristics and direction affecting the coastal stretch where the sea-cliff is located was performed. The probabilistic stability analysis, performed using the <b>SWEDGE</b> software, allowed the identification of joint set intersections with high wedge failure probabilities. The failure probability is strongly affected by the geo-structural and geo-mechanical layout of the rock mass. In this respect, the random properties of orientation of joints which define the wedges and their shear strength have an important effect in the safety factor calculation. As the deterministic approach {{does not take into account}} the variability of these parameters and can provide simplified and misleading results, the simultaneous analysis of kinematic and kinetic conditions can provide a better evaluation of the overall stability. Finally, a wedge probability failure zonation of the whole sea-cliff was proposed...|$|E
40|$|The rock slope failure {{object of}} this study {{occurred}} on the 12 th of March, 2005, within the Scascoli Gorges in the Savena Valley, 25 km south of Bologna, in the Northern Apennines, Italy. The failure involved a volume of rock of nearly 30000 m 3 that detached from an 80 m high cliff and fell on the river bed and onto the adjacent road, denoted as “Strada Provinciale – Fondovalle Savena”, damming the first and destroying the latter. The conformation of the cliff, known as “Mammellone 1 ”, was rather convex, overhanging and undercut at the base where {{in contact with the}} river bed. The event is the last of a series of mass movements which occurred in a 15 -year span in the area. With integration of past analyses and surveys, possible causes and mechanism of failure have been investigated by means of two and three-dimensional kinematic analysis (using the software DIPS and <b>SWEDGE</b> by Rocscience, 2016), photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning comparison (Cloud Compare, Daniel Girardeau-Montaut, 2016; Autocad, Autodesk, 2016) and two-dimensional finite element numerical modelling (RS 2, Rocscience, 2016). The use of a finite element method to model a predominantly blocky structure has shown to be effective and to produce good results if data integration, boundary conditions and geometry of the site are well correlated between each other to best fit the resulting scenario. The design of the numerical model considered the relative position of crown and scarp to the discontinuity families and to the geometry of the cross section, to better costrain the failure surface. Furthermore, the process of formation of the valley was taken into account in order to consider also stress-strain conditions prior to the road construction and river erosion. This was carried out by multi-staging the modelling process considering the natural erosion and the advancement of the landslide on the hydrogeological left side of the Savena steam before the last rockfall event...|$|E
