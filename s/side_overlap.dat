In this paper, we address some of the communication progress shortcomings in the current polling and RDMA Read based Rendezvous protocol used for transferring large messages in MPI. We then propose a novel speculative Rendezvous protocol that uses RDMA Read and RDMA Write to effectively improve communication progress and consequently the overlap ability.

The main purpose of this thesis is to assess accuracy that can be acquired with low-cost, commercially available UAV.

Additionally, various configurations of number and distribution of Ground Control Points are tested. The acquired accuracy is discussed with time and effort spent on the mission.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the configuration and technical specifications of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a red–green–blue (RGB) sensor for the acquisition of images needed {{for the production of}} orthomosaics to be used in archaeological applications. Several flight missions were programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 m above ground level; two forward and <b>side</b> <b>overlap</b> settings (80 %– 50 % and 70 %– 40 %); and the use, or lack thereof, of ground control points. These settings were chosen to analyze their influence on the spatial quality of orthomosaicked images processed by Inpho UASMaster (Trimble, CA, USA). Changes in illumination over the study area, its impact on flight duration, and how it relates to these settings is also considered. The combined effect of these parameters on spatial quality is presented as well, defining a ratio between ground sample distance of UAV images and expected root mean square of a UAV orthomosaick. The results indicate that a balance between all the proposed parameters is useful for optimizing mission planning and image processing, altitude above ground level (AGL) being main parameter because of its influence on root mean square error (RMSE) ...|$|E

Yet it retains the advantages of a photograph-virtually displaying actual cultural and land features and the built environment rather than representing those features using symbols and lines. With the development of technology, Digital photogrammetry has started to be used widely in almost all areas about mapping. Especially digital orthophotos which are a photogrammetric products, are being used by lots of private sectors because of theirs easy interpretability. Several photogrammetric software which can be use to generate orthophotos are Leica Photogrammetric System (LPS), PCI Geomatica, Topcon pi 3000, Image Master, Erdas Imagine, VirtuoZo and others. In this study photogrammetric data from aerial photographs was used to generate orthophoto using erdas imagine software. The processing procedure {{of the system is}} described in detail. Sets of measurements (length and width) of selected buildings were obtained. The results obtained from this software are compared with ground survey measurement. The results showed that an accuracy of sub-meter of ± 0. 406 m could be obtained from orthophoto generated using erdas imagine software. Conclusion is drawn concerning the suitability of the software for use in orthophoto generation.

Yet applications {{of this technology}} have out-paced {{understanding of the relationship}} between collection method and data quality. Here, UAV-SFM remote sensing was used to produce 3 D multispectral point clouds of Temperate Deciduous forests at different levels of UAV altitude, image overlap, weather, and image processing. Error in canopy height estimates was explained by the alignment of the canopy height model to the digital terrain model (R 2 = 0. 81) due to differences in lighting and image overlap. Accounting for this, no significant differences were observed in height error at different levels of lighting, altitude, and <b>side</b> <b>overlap.</b> Overall, accurate estimates of canopy height compared to field measurements (R 2 = 0. 86, RMSE = 3. 6 m) and LIDAR (R 2 = 0. 99, RMSE = 3. 0 m) were obtained under optimal conditions of clear lighting and high image overlap (> 80 %). Variation in point cloud quality appeared related to the behavior of SFM ‘image features’.

Bundle adjustment {{is one of the}} useful methods to determine the EOPs of all the images in a block with relatively low number of control points. As finding the corresponding points in is difficult especially in automatic matching procedures, and depending on the ground topography, some points might be hidden or be in occluded areas in images, in recent years, lots of investigations in the field of using straight line segments and other feature primitives in aerial triangulation are provided by different researchers. In this paper, the standard point-based collinearity equations together with the modified line-based collinearity equations proposed by Schenk are implemented and evaluated on a small block of six overlapped (60 % <b>side</b> <b>overlap</b> and 25 % strip overlap) digital aerial images of DiMac sensor. In this method, the optimal parametric representations of object straight lines are used to model the relationship between image space and object space. Parametric representation of features in object space allows the specification of any point on the feature. The main advantage of block adjustment using linear features is its high reliability and its capability to cope with the problem of occluded areas and is more reliability for automation. The results of block adjustment using points and lines, confirm the capabilities of the utilized method. 1...|$|E
