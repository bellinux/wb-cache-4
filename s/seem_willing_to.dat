5|$|Having taken {{office in}} 1805, Shaw {{determined}} to re-establish the tradition whereby the Lord Mayor took precedence in public processions within the City of London over all except the reigning monarch, {{and took the}} opportunity of the funeral of Lord Nelson in 1806 to do so. According to one account, Shaw discussed the matter with the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, who was aware that the Prince Regent would be attending the funeral, but did not <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take action. Shaw then offered to visit the King himself at Windsor Castle to resolve the matter, and Liverpool {{said that he would}} see what could be done. By the following day, the Royal Warrant of Precedence had been granted, and Shaw duly led the procession.|$|E
25|$|Harsh {{critics of}} {{artificial}} intelligence on ethical grounds {{are likely to}} promote collective wisdom-building methods, {{such as the new}} tribalists and the Gaians. Whether these can be said to be collective intelligence systems is an open question. Some, e.g. Bill Joy, simply wish to avoid any form of autonomous artificial intelligence and <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> work on rigorous collective intelligence in order to remove any possible niche for AI.|$|E
25|$|The {{most potent}} {{offering}} was animal sacrifice, typically of domesticated {{animals such as}} cattle, sheep and pigs. Each was the best specimen of its kind, cleansed, clad in sacrificial regalia and garlanded; the horns of oxen might be gilded. Sacrifice sought the harmonisation of the earthly and divine, so the victim must <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> offer its own life {{on behalf of the}} community; it must remain calm and be quickly and cleanly dispatched.|$|E
5000|$|The {{son of an}} indentured laborer turned slave, Gortokai is {{accepted}} as a [...] "son" [...] by one freeborn family and as a [...] "stranger son" [...] by another. Jomo <b>seems</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> accept this slave's son as a potential son-in-law, and Kema <b>seems</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> accept him as a potential brother-in-law, provided the price is right, but Tene never fully accepts him.|$|R

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Rolling Stone, Christopher Connelly called Thriller [...] "a zesty LP" [...] with a [...] "harrowing, dark message". He compared {{the songs on}} the album with the life challenges that the 24-year-old Jackson had faced since Off the Wall, while observing that he [...] "dropped the boyish falsetto" [...] and was facing his [...] "challenges head-on" [...] with [...] "a feisty determination" [...] and [...] "a full, adult voice". John Rockwell wrote in The New York Times that perhaps Jackson was a [...] "sometimes too practiced ... performer", that at times Quincy Jones may [...] "depersonalize his individuality" [...] with his [...] "slightly anonymous production", and that Jackson may be hiding his true emotions behind [...] "layers of impenetrable, gauzy veils". He nonetheless deemed Thriller [...] "a wonderful pop record, the latest statement {{by one of the}} great singers in popular music today" [...] and that there are [...] "hits here, too, lots of them". Rockwell believed it helped breach [...] "the destructive barriers that spring up regularly between white and black music", especially as [...] "white publications and radio stations that normally avoid black music <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pretend he isn't black after all". In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said [...] "this is virtually a hits-plus-filler job, but at such a high level it's almost classic anyway". He later wrote in retrospect, [...] "what we couldn't know is how brilliantly every hit but 'P.Y.T.' would thrive on mass exposure and public pleasure." [...] A year after the album's release, Time summed up the three main singles from the album, saying, [...] "The pulse of America and {{much of the rest of}} the world moves irregularly, beating in time to the tough strut of 'Billie Jean', the asphalt aria of 'Beat It', the supremely cool chills of 'Thriller'." [...] In 1989, Toronto Star music critics reflected on the albums they had reviewed in the past ten years in order to create a list judging them on the basis of [...] "commercial impact to social import, to strictly musical merit." [...] Thriller was placed at number 1 on the list, where it was referred to as his [...] "master work" [...] and that [...] "commercial success has since overshadowed Jackson's artistic accomplishments on Thriller, and that's a pity. It was a record for the times, brimming with breathless anticipation and a dread fear of the adult world, a brilliant fantasy that pumped with sexual heat, yet made room for serious reflection".|$|E
2500|$|Glaeser, Gottlieb and Ziv suggest {{in their}} {{conclusion}} that the happiness trade-offs that individuals <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> make aligns with the tendency of parents to report less happiness, as they sacrifice their personal well-being for the [...] "price" [...] of having children.|$|E

6000|$|Ak smiled, but continued, in soft tones: [...] "It {{seems that}} the deer which are guarded by your people can be of great {{assistance}} to Claus, and as they <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> draw his sledge I beg that you will permit him to use their services whenever he pleases." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Macallister. [...] "The boat came round {{under our}} quarter, and we landed {{him through the}} lower gangway. He said he'd stay here and wait for ye. He's no sociable, anyway. I've offered him cigars and anisow, besides some of my special whisky, {{but he did not}} <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> talk to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{good many}} people have had to take me in that way, and they <b>seemed</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> do so--the thing's not {{uncommon}} in the West. Why should I be more particular than they were?" ...|$|R

[...] "After all, {{one has to}} admit that there is, perhaps, some foundation for the equality notion in a democratic country, but from what I know of yours, while you <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> act upon it in regard to Scandinavians, Teutons, Poles, and Englishmen, you make Indians and niggers an exception." ...|$|E
60|$|You say {{you will}} not fight to free negroes. Some of them <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> fight for you; but no matter. Fight you, then, {{exclusively}} to save the Union.

Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the Union, if I shall urge you to continue fighting, {{it will be an}} apt time then for you to declare you will not fight to free negroes.|$|E

Perhaps so, but I earn my money with {{considerably}} more effort than you <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> make. The cook will give you dinner with the other men to-day; then you can resume your search for an easy billet. We have no room in this camp for idlers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Home," [...] pursued Graham, undeterred by his mother's remonstrance, [...] "might I {{have the}} honour to {{introduce}} myself, {{since no one}} else <b>seems</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> render you and me that service? Your slave, John Graham Bretton." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I am not accustomed, sir,' {{said the}} father, {{in a very}} haughty tone, 'to have my word disputed. But,' he added, while the angry hue passed from his cheek, after a moment's reflection, 'you know me not, {{and ought to be}} excused. I will repose more {{confidence}} in your honour than you <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> rest upon mine; and, since we are so situated that one must rely upon the other's faith, I will cause you to be set presently at liberty, and furnished with the means of delivering your letter as addressed, provided that now, knowing the contents, you think it safe for yourself to execute the commission.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{let it go}} at that. The {{fact that}} Gregory sent me over for you implied a certain obligation. How far events have cleared me of it I don't know--and you don't <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> tell me. But I believe there is now less cause than there was for me to thrust my own wishes into the background, and, as I start in another week, the {{situation}} has forced my hand.

I will frankly admit that as yet we have not made up our minds how to act. Yet {{it seems to me that}} you go a little far. We have more faith in ourselves and in the destinies of our ancient kingdom than you <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> give us credit for. The end might be as you say supposing we found ourselves involved with one of the great Powers. But let me assure you, Baron Domiloff, that the contest would be no bloodless one. Theos has held her own, beset though she has been by powerful enemies, for many centuries." ...|$|E

60|$|October 5th.--Yesterday I {{was present}} at a dejeuner on board the James Barnes, on {{occasion}} of her coming under the British flag, having been built for the Messrs. Barnes by Donald McKay of Boston. She is a splendid vessel, and magnificently fitted up, though not with consummate taste. It would be worth while that ornamental architects and upholsterers should study this branch of art, since the ship-builders <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> expend {{a good deal of}} money on it. In fact, I do not see that there is anywhere else so much encouragement to the exercise of ornamental art. I saw nothing to criticise in the solid and useful details of the ship; the ventilation, in particular, being free and abundant, so that the hundreds of passengers who will have their berths between decks, and at a still lower depth, will have good air and enough of it.|$|E
60|$|In {{the evening}} Miss S------ and I {{drove to the}} railway, and on {{the arrival of the}} train from Florence we watched with much eagerness the {{unlading}} of the luggage-van. At last the whole of our ten trunks and tin bandbox were produced, and finally my leather bag, in which was my journal and a manuscript book containing my sketch of a romance. It gladdened my very heart to see it, and I shall think the better of Tuscan promptitude and accuracy for so quickly bringing it back to me. (It was left behind, under one of the rail-carriage seats.) We find all the public officials, whether of railway, police, or custom-house, extremely courteous and pleasant to encounter; they <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take trouble and reluctant to give it, and it is really a gratification to find that such civil people will sometimes oblige you by taking a paul or two aside.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I trust,' replied Darsie, at last, 'that I {{shall never}} be found {{indifferent}} to the call of either; but to answer them with effect--even were I convinced that they now sounded in my ear--I must see some reasonable hope of success in the desperate enterprise in which you would involve me. I look around me, and I see a settled government--an established authority--a born Briton on the throne--the very Highland mountaineers, upon whom alone {{the trust of the}} exiled family reposed, assembled into regiments which act under the orders of the existing dynasty. [The Highland regiments were first employed by the celebrated Earl of Chatham, who assumed to himself no small degree of praise for having called forth to the support of the country and the government, the valour which had been too often directed against both.] France has been utterly dismayed by the tremendous lessons of the last war, and will hardly provoke another. All without and within the kingdom is adverse to encountering a hopeless struggle, and you alone, sir, <b>seem</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> undertake a desperate enterprise.' ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the midst}} of these intense phrases he whistled gayly or broke off to attend to his cooking. He told of his hard experiences, with pride and joy, and said, [...] "Isn't it lucky I caught you just here?" [...] and <b>seemed</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> talk all night.|$|R
6000|$|Evelyn looked surprised, and {{he spread}} {{out his hands}} in a humorous manner.
