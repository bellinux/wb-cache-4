2500|$|In {{a search}} on 19 September, Spanish police seized {{significant}} election material {{which had been}} in store by referendum organizers at the offices of a private delivery company in Terrassa. These included voting cards contained in envelopes with the Catalan government's logo. The next day, the Civil Guard raided Generalitat offices and arrested fourteen senior officials from the Catalan government—most notably, these included , deputy to regional Vice-President Oriol Junqueras. This came after mayors from towns supporting the referendum were questioned in court by state prosecutors. Regional premier Carles Puigdemont condemned the actions as [...] "anti-democratic and totalitarian", accusing the Spanish government of 'de facto' imposing {{a state of emergency}} and of suspending Catalonia's autonomy after it took effective control over Catalan finances. Public protests occurred in Barcelona after news of the arrests emerged, with left-wing political party Podemos and Barcelona mayor Ada Colau joining the growing criticism of Mariano Rajoy's government crackdown on public servants, dubbing it as an [...] "authoritarian regression". The previous day, the Congress of Deputies had voted down a motion from Ciudadanos to support the Spanish government's response to the referendum, which was rejected by 166 votes to 158. Rajoy defended his government's actions in that [...] "What we're seeing in Catalonia is an attempt to eliminate the constitution and the autonomous <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catalonia...</b> Logically, the state has to react. There is no democratic state in the world that would accept what these people are trying to do. They've been warned and they know the referendum can't take place". Rajoy also called for the Catalonia government to give up its [...] "escalation of radicalism and disobedience", calling for them to [...] "Go back to the law and democracy" [...] and dubbing the referendum a [...] "chimera", as tens of thousands gathered in the streets of Barcelona and other Catalan cities to protest police actions. The Spanish government did not rule out invoking Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which would allow the central government to adopt [...] "the necessary measures to compel regional authorities to obey the law"—in practice, allowing for the autonomy's effective suspension and [...] of the region.|$|E

50|$|In 1931 the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed, but {{the lack}} of a strong leader and mature separatist party {{extinguished}} the aspirations to independence embodied in this text. Therefore, the constitution never came into effect, and instead the Catalan authorities presented the Draft <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catalonia</b> of 1932 to the Spanish Government. This statute (regional constitution), however, was also rejected, and finally the governments of Spain and Catalonia approved the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catalonia</b> of 1932.|$|E

5000|$|The PP under Mariano Rajoy {{has opposed}} the PSOE {{government}} since the PP lost {{the general election}} in 2004, arguing that this victory {{was influenced by the}} Madrid bombings of 11 March 2004. At a national level, its political strategy has followed two main axes, both linked to Spain's delicate regional politics: Firstly, opposing further administrative devolution to Catalonia by means of the newly approved [...] "Estatut" [...] or <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catalonia</b> that lays out the powers of the Catalan regional government. Secondly, opposition to political negotiations with the Basque separatist organization ETA.|$|E
50|$|In the {{elections}} for the Provincial Government of Catalonia, an organization was created to prepare and approve a draft statute for the autonomy of Catalonia.Irla and Lluís Companys were chosen vice presidents.Irla was involved in creating the draft statute of autonomy known as the Statute of Núria.

50|$|This first {{tripartite}} rule {{became an}} uneasy coalition due to {{tensions between the}} PSC and ERC and internal tensions between PSC and PSOE as well.

50|$|The {{coalition}} {{aimed at}} promoting {{a degree of}} autonomy and self-governance of Galicia from Spain equal to that <b>of</b> <b>Catalonia</b> and the Basque Country, other autonomous communities of Spain.

5000|$|The People's Party {{attempted}} {{to reject the}} admission into the Cortes of the 2005 reform of the Autonomy <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catalonia</b> {{on the grounds that}} it should be dealt with as a constitutional reform rather than a mere statute reform because it allegedly contradicts the spirit of the Constitution in many points, especially the Statute's alleged breaches of the [...] "solidarity between regions" [...] principle enshrined by the Constitution. After failing to assemble the required majority to dismiss the text, the People's Party filed a claim of unconstitutionality against several dozen articles of the text before the Spanish Constitutional Court for them to be struck down.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catalonia</b> of 1919 {{started in}} a pro-autonomist {{environment}} and {{was approved by}} the Assembly of the Commonwealth of Catalonia in Barcelona, on 24 January 1919 with the support of several Catalan parties: The Partit Català Republicà (Republican Catalan Party) took this Statute as its main concern, Alejandro Lerroux's radicals endorsed it, Francesc Cambó and his party (Lliga Regionalista) asked for a pragmatic vision. Liberals and Conservatives (who were in the Spanish government) went against central party policy, and the Traditionalists remembered his defense of autonomy with weapons. Francesc Macià -speaking as a supporter of independence- said that this was a short Statute, but the best one that could be achieved. Finally, Largo Caballero, speaking as a Socialist, stated that Spanish workers believed that Catalan Autonomy was {{the first step in the}} regeneration of Spain.|$|E
50|$|On 28 January 1939, Josep Irla, President of the Catalan Parliament, {{began his}} exile.

All their property in Sant Feliu de Guixols were confiscated by the fascist authorities.He lived {{for a time in}} Le Boulou (Roussillon) and later settled in Ceret (Vallespir), where he sought his livelihood dedicated to what he did best: the cork industry. In 1940, he was arrested by the Vichy French authorities and confined in Le Mans, where he could escape and return to Céret.With the execution of Lluis Companys, 15 October 1940, he refused to travel to America and became, automatically, President of the Generalitat of Catalonia according to the Interior <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catalonia.</b> He was the only modern president who would not set foot, as such, the Palace of the Generalitat. Then, he moved to Cogolin, where he resumed the manufacture of cork stoppers, an activity that provided the resources needed to survive.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyse the section <b>of</b> the 2006 <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy <b>of</b> <b>Catalonia</b> which {{attributes}} the Catalan Government with exclusive powers on the matter of protection of minors (Section 166. 3, a)). At a first sight, such section does not seem to contain many interpretative problems. However, there is a rich doctrinal debate on the extension and significance of the wording and concepts of this section. In this sense, the concept itself of “the protection of minors”, the meaning of the final clause of the section “in compliance with the criminal law”, and the disturbing reference to “young offenders”, all of them clearly show the need to have an in-depth reconsideration of the issue which, also in the light <b>of</b> the 1979 <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy <b>of</b> <b>Catalonia,</b> could solve most of the questions about the significance and meaning of this section...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this article analyses the perception of the new draft <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catalonia</b> in the Spanish written press. The study was performed by analysing the editorials and the front pages published in twelve newspapers all over Spain between the 1 st of October and the 15 th of December 2005. The new draft <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catalonia</b> triggered an oversized debate that converted the media into a true political arena, a public locus where the media and politicians displayed a host of cooperative or competitive ideological strategies. The article concludes that the new Statute was harshly rejected in the majority of newspapers, especially in some of the national broadsheets, and it tries to pinpoint the differences among these twelve newspapers. The research also dissects the strong and weak points of the draft Statute in the newspapers analysed...|$|E

Additionally, it deals with the presentation of the Generalitat as the ordinary governing body and the treatment of other institutions such as the Accounts Syndicate and the Audiovisual Council.

40|$|The diploma thesis Reform of the Autonomous <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catalonia</b> and its {{relation}} to the Reform of Spanish Constitution and territorial organization deals with the issue of Catalan autonomy and in particular with the recent reform of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia in 2006. It is a complete reform, which provoked a controversy leading even before the Constitutional Court and divided the political actors both on the Catalan and on the Spanish level. The extension of autonomy in the areas of competencies, financing, doctrinal aspects relating to the recognition of Catalan as an official language and especially to the denomination of Catalonia as a nation, has caused a growing divergence between autonomous communities and could lead to the aspirations of other to acquire the same status or privileges as Catalonia. The Spanish Constitution does not provide any specific definition of territorial organization, which gives the autonomous communities the possibility to specify the scope and extent of their autonomy. The debate concerning the Constitutional reform, which could make the system more clear and effective, started as a reaction to the statute reform in Catalonia. In the current political context, the reform of the Constitution seems to be unreal as the two main political parties - PP and PSOE - are [...] ...|$|E
