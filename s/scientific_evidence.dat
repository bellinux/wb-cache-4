5|$|Modern {{feminism}} {{challenges the}} essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths of Gender, explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In Delusions of Gender, Cordelia Fine disputes <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> {{that suggests that}} there is an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.|$|E

40|$|Assisted {{by gender}} and science studies, {{especially}} by Londa Schiebinger’s works, we aim to reflect upon the notions of nature and <b>scientific</b> <b>evidences</b> which emerge around giving birth and reastfeeding, based on the case study of a blog targeted by mothers who identify themselves as “mammalians”. We noticed that the analyzed narratives support themselves in <b>scientific</b> <b>evidences</b> in order to legitimate the ideal of humanization {{and the notion that}} women are an extension of nature. Paradoxically, the narratives show that the advocacy of childbirth humanization and breastfeeding is grounded in a biological determinism, which effects towards the perpetuation of unequal gender relations have been pointed out by feminist studies for decades. We have questioned the notion of nature, as portrayed in “mammalian networks”, to untie biologizing knots and expose the political power of activism in motherhood-oriented websites...|$|R

5|$|The {{name was}} coined by the {{historian}} Andrew Watson in an influential 1974 paper. He listed eighteen crops that were widely diffused during the Islamic period, including four staple crops, namely durum wheat, Asiatic rice, sorghum, and cotton.

The paper was not based on direct archaeological or <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence,</b> and its approach has been called old-fashioned and philological.|$|E
5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up {{on its hind legs}} to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, in a way it resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, older {{historical}} {{analyses were}} challenged by {{a range of}} neo-positivist, Marxist and econometric approaches, supported by a widening body of documentary, archaeological and <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence.</b> Marxist and Neo-Marxist analyses continued to be popular in the post-war years, producing seminal works on economic issues and social protests. Post-modern analysis became influential in the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on identity, gender, interpretation and culture. Many studies focused on particular regions or groups, drawing on new records and new scientific approaches, including landscape and environmental archaeology. Fresh archaeological finds, such as the Staffordshire Hoard, continue to challenge previous interpretations, and historical studies of England in the Middle Ages have never been so diverse as in the early 21st century.|$|E

5|$|Deep dives {{should be}} made only after a gradual {{training}} to test the individual diver's sensitivity to increasing depths, with careful supervision and logging of reactions.

40|$|Motivation: Identifying drug-drug {{interactions}} is {{a critical}} process in drug administration and drug development. Clinical support tools often provide comprehensive lists of drug-drug interactions, but they usually lack the supporting <b>scientific</b> <b>evidences</b> and different tools can return inconsistent results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates text mining and automated reasoning to derive drug-drug interactions. Through the extraction of various facts of drug metabolism, not only the drug-drug interactions that are explicitly mentioned in text can be extracted but also the potential interactions that can be inferred by reasoning. Results: Our approach {{was able to find}} several potential drug-drug interactions that are not present in DrugBank. We manually evaluated these interactions based on their supporting evidences, and our analysis revealed that 81. 3 % of these interactions are determined to be correct. This suggests that our approach can uncover potential drug-drug interactions with <b>scientific</b> <b>evidences</b> explaining the mechanism of the interactions. Contact: Luis Tar...|$|R
