500|$|The Act {{extends the}} reach of implied {{conditions}} first {{laid out in the}} Sale of Goods Act 1893. Section 1 replaced Section 12 of the 1893 Act, containing 3 types of implied undertakings to title; a condition that the seller has the right to sell, or will when the property has passed to him, a warranty that the goods have no additional costs that the buyer has not been informed of, and a warranty of quiet possession. These provisions cannot be excluded, although if there is, in the original contract, a provision that the seller can only transfer what title he has, there is no condition that the seller has the right to sell. The Act also regulated <b>sale</b> by <b>description,</b> where products are sold based on a description given of them. Section 2 provides that [...] "a sale of goods shall not be prevented from being a <b>sale</b> by <b>description</b> by reason only that, being exposed for sale or hire, they are selected by the buyer". This is to ensure that a sale in a self-service store is considered <b>sale</b> by <b>description,</b> and that the sale is therefore covered by other provisions.|$|R

40|$|The {{carnivorous}} Tyrannosauridae {{are among}} the most iconic dinosaurs: typified by large body size, tiny forelimbs, and massive robust skulls with laterally thickened teeth. The recently described small-bodied tyrannosaurid Raptorex kreigsteini is exceptional as its discovery proposes that many of the distinctive anatomical traits of derived tyrannosaurids were acquired in the Early Cretaceous, before the evolution of large body size. This inference depends on two core interpretations: that the holotype (LH PV 18) derives from the Lower Cretaceous of China, and that despite its small size, it is a subadult or young adult. Here we show that the published data is equivocal regarding stratigraphic position and that ontogenetic reanalysis shows {{there is no reason to}} conclude that LH PV 18 has reached this level of maturity. The probable juvenile status of LH PV 18 makes its use as a holotype unreliable, since diagnostic features of Raptorex may be symptomatic of its immature status, rather than its actual phylogenetic position. These findings are consistent with the original <b>sale</b> <b>description</b> of LH PV 18 as a juvenile Tarbosaurus from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia. Consequently, we suggest that there is currently no evidence to support the conclusion that tyrannosaurid skeletal design first evolved in the Earl...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{has been}} focused on sales representatives recruitment selection and their following adaptation. There are clear determined and linked activities which precede recruitment and adaptation process. Without these activities {{it is not possible to}} carry out complex recruitment process. Attention is paid to a job analysis process, which is followed by a job description forming. The chapter, which is aimed to the theory of competencies and competency model, is an important part of this thesis. If recruitment selection is well realized and the selected candidate accepts job offer and joins the position, adaptation process of a new employee will follow. Adaptation is an important period when manager of the new employee plays very significant role. Adaptation of the new employee, which is implemented in a high quality, can start his professional development and futher career growth. Special care is paid to sales representatives recruitment selection and adaptation process in Coca-Cola HBC. Sales representatives enter into very close relationship with customers and their success affects companie's performance on the market. Competencies and competency model penetrate the whole personnel policy of the company. There are the <b>sales</b> representative job <b>description</b> and the specific competency model.

40|$|Here, {{we study}} {{the case where}} the {{portfolio}} rebalancement involves the payment of taxes on benefits. Then, the purchasing time of the asset to be sold has to be recorded in order to compute the amount of tax to be paid. In addition to the no-short-selling constraint, our model assumes that sales {{are subject to the}} first-in-first-out priority rule on <b>sales.</b> A precise <b>description</b> of the model is given in Section 2. The agent problem {{turns out to be a}} nonclassical optimal control problem with endogeneous delay and with complex nonnegativity constraint on consumption. Section 3 is devoted to the proof of the following economic appealing result. An optimal strategy can always be chosen such that the agent never sells out of his portfolio and buy new Financial assets simultaneously. Using this property, the nonnegativity constraint on consumption is simplified and reduced to a classical constraint on the controls and the state variables. Namely, the nonnegativity constraint on consumption can be expressed simply in terms of the investment and the disinvestment functions. In Section 4, we assume some additional smoothness conditions on the optimal strategy in order to derive the first-order conditions associated to the control problem of interest. The usual variational methods are adapted to handle the endogeneous delay function...|$|R
40|$|Mat rush is an {{important}} crop for "Tatami" which is laid {{on the floor in}} a traditional Japanese room. Rush stems are woven into "Tatami-omote" which is used as the facing material of "Tatami". According to our life style, it is not too much to say that "Tatami" has built up Japanese people's character and has grown their culture. The materials of quality has been severely required, consequently the production has been specified into the limited places in Japan. The producing system, i. e. the cultivation and post-harvest processing of mat rush, has been established by farmers. However, the theoretical background of the producing system has not been clear, because it has been created by farmers' experiences based on a trial and error. It is urgently required to elucidate this point in order to improve yield in quality and quantity, and to hand down people's wisdom from generation to generation, especially in the present circumstances that well-experienced farmers are disappearing. 　From this viewpoint, the cultivation technique was analyzed {{on the basis of the}} locality of cultivation technique and growth type and the growih characteristics of mat rush in response to environmental conditions. And a principle of mat rush cultivation was extracted, then verified by an experimental cultivation. As to the post-harvest processing technique, the process of quality formation was studied, especially the effect of "Dorozome (procedure of soaking harvested stems in mud before drying them) " on the quality of "Tatami-omote" was analyzed. 　The analysis on the process of growth and production showed that the most important point in the cultivation was the growth regulation focusing on the developmental phase of individual plant in the middle part of May. The reason was because a state of growth in this season directly determined the number of stems for harvest, and affected their elongation in the following period through crop photosynthesis ruled by canopy structure, subsequently determined the long stem yield. Moreover, the analysis on the locality in cultivation management and growth type revealed that an ideal growth was easily created in the Setouchi area that was the most traditional area in mat rush production, and the locality in the cultivation managements resulted from intending to create the same ideal growth under different climatic conditions. 　On the other hand, "Dorozome" had an extremely useful effect on producing a specific Sense of touch and looks in "Tatami-omote". However, the characters of harvested stems, which were peculiar to the place of production in Japan, still appeared in "Tatami-omote", even after the stems were processed and woven. These might be a Scientific background supporting the "Tatami-omote" production and <b>sale</b> on <b>description.</b> These results show that the producing system of mat rush has established on the Scientific basis, even though it has created and integrated by farmers' experiences and Senses without any scientific detectors and apparatus. This fact may be very suggestive To us And the results obtained in this study are sure to be the foundations for the Improvement of mat rush production...|$|R
6000|$|If ever {{this nation}} {{stood in a}} {{situation}} of glory throughout Asia, it was in that moment. But, as I have said, some material errors and mistakes were committed. After the formation of this plan, Lord Clive unfortunately did not stay long enough in the country to give consistency to the measures of reformation he had undertaken, but rapidly returned to England; and after his departure, the government that continued had not vigor or authority to support the settlement then made, and considerable abuses began to prevail in every quarter. Another capital period in our history here commences. Those who succeeded (though I believe one of them was one of the honestest men that ever served the Company, I mean Governor Verelst) had not weight enough to poise the system of the service, and consequently many abuses and grievances again prevailed. Supervisors were appointed to every district, as a check on the native collectors, and to report every abuse as it should arise. But they who were appointed to redress grievances were themselves accused of being guilty of them. However, the disorders were not of that violent kind which preceded Mr. Hastings's departure, nor such as followed his return: no mercenary wars, no mercenary revolutions, no extirpation of nations, no violent convulsions in the revenue, no subversion of ancient houses, no general <b>sales</b> of any <b>descriptions</b> of men,--none of these, but certainly such grievances as made it necessary for the Company to send out another commission in 1769, with instructions pointing out the chief abuses. It was composed of Mr. Vansittart, Mr. Ford, and Mr. Scrafton. The unfortunate end of that commission is known to all the world; but I mention it in order to state that the receipt of presents was considered as one of the grievances which then prevailed in India, and that the supervisors under that commission were ordered upon no account whatever to take presents. Upon the unfortunate catastrophe which happened, the Company was preparing to send out another for the rectification of these grievances, when Parliament thought it necessary to supersede that commission, to take the matter into their own hands, and to appoint another commission in a Parliamentary way (of which Mr. Hastings was one) for the better government of that country. Mr. Hastings, as I must mention to your Lordships, soon after the deposition and restoration of Jaffier Ali Khân, and before Lord Clive arrived, quitted for a while the scene in which he had been so mischievously employed, and returned to England to strengthen himself by those cabals which again sent him out with new authority to pursue the courses which were the natural sequel to his former proceedings. He returned to India with great power, indeed,--first to a seat in Council at Fort St. George, and from thence to succeed to the Presidency of Fort William. On him the Company placed their chief reliance. Happy had it been for them, happy for India and for England, if his conduct had been such as to spare your Lordships and the Commons the exhibition of this day! ...|$|R
