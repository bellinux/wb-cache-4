5|$|In February 1846 Stone intimated to Abby Kelley Foster that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> {{becoming}} a public speaker, {{but not until}} the following summer did a storm of controversy over Foster’s speaking at Oberlin decide the matter for her. Faculty opposition to Foster ignited impassioned discussion of women’s rights among the students, especially of woman’s right to speak in public, which Stone vigorously defended in a joint meeting of the men’s and women’s literary societies. She followed that campus demonstration by making her first public speech at Oberlin’s August 1 commemoration of Emancipation in the West Indies.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé Knowles {{began working}} on her second solo album B'Day {{following}} the conclusion of filming for Dreamgirls. She revealed: [...] " [...] I had so many things bottled up, so many emotions, so many ideas". Beyoncé contacted American songwriter-producer Sean Garrett, and booked him at the Sony Music Studios in New York City, where [...] "Get Me Bodies" [...] was recorded. She also called American hip hop producer-rapper Kasseem [...] "Swizz Beatz" [...] Dean, her sister and singer, Solange, her cousin Angela Beyincé, and songwriter Makeba Riddick. Beyoncé took inspiration from Solange, who helped {{in the writing process}} of the song, and former Destiny's Child band-mates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. In [...] "Get Me Bodied", she mentioned [...] "three best friends" [...] because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> them while writing. While working on the lyrics, Swizz Beatz and the other producers in the team handled its production.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{aside from}} the three men, Carey worked with Carole King, a female singer-songwriter who had been {{predominantly}} popular in the 1970s. However, unlike with C+C Music Factory, King approached Carey, hoping {{to work with her}} after hearing her perform live on The Arsenio Hall Show. During a conversation with Carey, King suggested that she cover [...] "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman," [...] a song she had written with Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin. After giving it some thought, Carey declined the offer, feeling uncomfortable about recording a song she felt one of her musical influences performed so perfectly. Still determined on working with Carey, King flew to New York for one day, to try to create a ballad of some sort. The two ladies sat together by a piano {{over the course of the}} day, and by nightfall, had written and arranged a song titled [...] "If It's Over." [...] After working with Carey, King said in an interview [...] "I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings." [...] After recording [...] "If It's Over," [...] Carey expressed the musical connection she shared with Afanasieff, as well as the creative format in which she wrote and produced her music when with him, or working with C+C Music Factory. When working with Afanasieff, the duo would sit by a piano, and lead each other vocally and musically, until they would reach the right note and arrangement. During an interview in 1992, Afanasieff described how Carey would stand next to him, and begin singing different notes and tunes <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of,</b> while he would follow her with the piano. In doing so, he would help lead her to the right note and vice versa. Carey described their working relationship as [...] "very unique," [...] and felt it to be very similar to the form in which she had worked with Margulies. While similar, Carey's creative process with Cole and Clivillés proved different; they would bring her several different tapes and tunes, of which she would choose from. Afterwards, they would work on building the already created melody, and have Carey add and build onto it, as well as writing the lyrics and key.|$|E

60|$|This {{had been}} Bernard's own reflection, {{and it was}} no more {{agreeable}} as Mrs. Vivian presented it; though Angela herself seemed indifferent to it--seemed, indeed, not to hear it, as if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> something else.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Tremayne {{looked up}} with a rueful smile. [...] "I thought you boasted that you never forced a confidence." [...] And then he looked away. [...] "Sylvia Armytage tells me that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> {{returning}} to England." ...|$|R

Minaj told MTV News that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> collaborating with Eminem for a while and in the end simply asked him: ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1936, Faustina {{went to see}} Archbishop Jałbrzykowski {{to discuss}} a new {{congregation}} for Divine Mercy. But he reminded {{her that she was}} perpetually vowed to her current order. In March 1936, Faustina told her superiors that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> leaving the order to start a new one specifically devoted to Divine Mercy, but she was transferred to Walendów, southwest of Warsaw. She reported that Jesus had said to her: [...] "My Daughter, do whatever is within your power to spread devotion to My Divine Mercy, I will make up for what you lack." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{got started}} in the field when she met an agent while she was working at a cabaret club. She at first refused the offer but then decided to [...] "give it a shot". She began with {{magazine}} work and then went into videos. Ichigo's first video, I Love You Ichigo Milk, was released December 25, 2000 for the Kuki Tank label. She has {{said that she was}} nervous at her debut and had to take [...] "lots of breaks". The actors and director were angry with her, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> giving up and going home. She remembers that first director as being a [...] "really weird man by the name Happy Yamada", a unique person. She would go on to work with Yamada in numerous videos over the next two years.|$|E

5000|$|Invictus is {{a poem by}} William Ernest Henley. Liz {{recognizes the}} poem from the 2009 film Invictus and wonders aloud, [...] "Who was the white guy in that?"

60|$|Into her mind, {{never far}} distant from it, came {{the thought of}} Derek.
