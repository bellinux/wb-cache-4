5000|$|One of {{the largest}} and most {{controversial}} projects is the North Island Grid Upgrade (NIGU) between the southern Waikato and Central Auckland. The project involved a 220 kV switching station at Drury, upgrading the existing 220 kV Otahuhu to Whakamaru C line, new capacitors at Otahuhu, Penrose, and Hepburn Road substations, and the construction of a new 220/400 kV transmission line between Whakamaru and Pakuranga. Transpower submitted its initial investment proposal for the project in May 2005. The regulatory process for investment approval for the project created significant tension between Transpower and the Electricity Commission, and led to political pressure for progress, to ensure the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> supply to Auckland. There were strong protests against the proposed transmission line during the initial planning and regulatory approval process from those most directly affected. Many individuals and communities living near the proposed route expressed concerns about the visual impact of the line, possible health effects, and the devaluation of their properties. A particular point of concern was that the proposed transmission towers were to be up to 70 metres (230 ft) in height.Cabinet Minister Pete Hodgson used powers under the Resource Management Act to [...] "call in" [...] Transpower's proposal, because of its national significance. He established a Board of Inquiry to consider the designations and resource consents required for the project. The Board of Inquiry gave its final approval for the project in September 2009.|$|E

40|$|In Germany and beyond, various {{capacity}} {{mechanisms are}} currently being discussed {{with a view to}} improving the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> supply. One of these mechanisms is a strategic reserve that retains generation capacity for use in times of critical supply shortage.

To date, however, the debate on capacity mechanisms has largely been restricted to national contexts. Against this background, we discuss the feasibility and potential benefits of coordinated cross-border strategic reserves to safeguard electricity supply and aid the energy transition in Germany and neighboring countries at large. Setting aside strategic reserve capacity which is deployed only in the event of extreme supply shortages could improve the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> supply without distorting the EU's internal electricity market.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} and models {{the vulnerability of}} the electricity power supply under extreme weather conditions. The system under study is the electric supply system that includes major power plants to main load centers. Extreme weather conditions can cause common mode contingencies (CMCs) of overhead power lines, which endanger the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> supply. Planning and operation of transmission systems are subject to N- 1 criterion, which requires that all single failures of network elements do not cause a breach of safety limits. This criterion does not guarantee the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> supply at the time of extreme weather conditions. The objective of this research is to identify critical and plausible CMCs, taking into account space-time correlations of extreme weather conditions and possible states of the network. The most vulnerable zones are focused on to determine appropriate countermeasures for reducing vulnerability. In the past, extreme weather events have caused major disruptions. For example, the blackout in New York in 1977 was initiated by three impacts of lightning on high voltage lines.

40|$|This study investigates how demand-side changes, as {{a result}} of a {{large-scale}} transition to electric vehicles (EVs), is likely to affect the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> supply in Norway. The study is based on a survey that asked 398 EV-users when they charge their EV during the day and night. By looking at two scenarios for EV market penetration, consumption curves was estimated and analyzed based on power consumption data from 2012. The study finds that the prospected EV-transition is likely to worsen the security of supply, in that the variability in the consumption curve is likely to increase and the frequency balance will therefore be more difficult to maintain, all other factors held constant. The peak demand hours during the winter stand a higher chance of surpassing available installed capacity under the scenarios of EV penetration compared to the power consumption in 2012. The existing plans to improve the Norwegian power grid, increase installed capacity and expand power connections abroad, will likely be sufficient to tackle a large scale transition to EVs and to maintain the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> supply. The study also finds that the power demand from a large EV fleet can potentially improve the security of supply, if EV-users charge their EVs during the hours that are more convenient for the power system, during the night. nhhma...|$|E
