25|$|When {{power is}} first {{applied to the}} circuit, {{there will be a}} glow {{discharge}} across the electrodes in the starter lamp. This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by thermionic emission. In the starter, the touching contacts <b>short</b> <b>out</b> the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within a second or two. The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit.|$|E
500|$|The varying {{conditions}} in the magnetosphere, known as space weather, are largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the magnetosphere and more of it gets in. Periods of particularly intense activity, called geomagnetic storms, can occur when a coronal mass ejection erupts above the Sun and sends a shock wave through the Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the Earth. Geomagnetic storms can {{cause a lot of}} disruption; the [...] "Halloween" [...] storm of 2003 damaged {{more than a third of}} NASA's satellites. The largest documented storm occurred in 1859. It induced currents strong enough to <b>short</b> <b>out</b> telegraph lines, and aurorae were reported as far south as Hawaii.|$|E
500|$|The script of Quatermass and the Pit {{is largely}} {{faithful}} to the television original. The plot was heavily condensed to fit the shorter running time of the film, with the main casualty being the removal of a subplot involving the journalist James Fullalove, who {{does not appear in}} the film adaptation at all. The climax was altered slightly to make it more cinematic, with Roney using a crane to <b>short</b> <b>out</b> the Martian influence, whereas in the television version he merely throws a metal chain into the pit. The setting for the pit itself was changed from a building site to the London Underground. The closing scene of the television version, in which Quatermass pleads with humanity to prevent Earth's becoming the [...] "second dead planet", was also dropped, in favour of a shot of Quatermass and Judd sitting alone amid the devastation wrought by the Martian spacecraft. The script was sent to John Trevelyan of the British Board of Film Censors in December 1966. Trevelyan replied that the film would require an 'X'-Certificate and raised concerns regarding the sound of the vibrations from the alien ship, the scenes of the Martian massacre, the scenes of destruction and panic as the Martian influence takes hold and the image of the Devil.|$|E

2500|$|Appearances in Crookham's court were [...] "short and sweet," [...] {{according}} to a quotation in the press by Timothy Wood of the Oregon Department of Justice, who had argued at trial before the judge. [...] Crookham didn't cut the lawyers' arguments <b>short</b> <b>out</b> of impatience or rudeness, but because he had already studied the issues so thoroughly.

2500|$|Another {{problem to}} be solved for a safe return was {{accomplishing}} a complete power-up from scratch of the completely shut-down Command Module, something never intended to be done in-flight. Flight controller John Aaron, {{with the support of}} grounded astronaut Mattingly and many engineers and designers, had to invent a new procedure to do this with the ship's limited power supply and time factor. This was further {{complicated by the fact that}} the reduced power levels in the LM caused internal temperatures to drop to as low as [...] The unpowered CM got so cold that water began to condense on solid surfaces, causing concern that this might <b>short</b> <b>out</b> electrical systems when it was reactivated. This turned out not to be a problem, partly because of the extensive electrical insulation improvements instituted after the Apollo 1 fire.|$|E

6000|$|... 3. Rhythm of the Phrase.--Some way back, I used a word {{which still}} awaits an application. Each phrase, I said, {{was to be}} comely; but what is a comely phrase? In all ideal and {{material}} points, literature, being a representative art, must look for analogies to painting and the like; but in what is technical and executive, being a temporal art, it must seek for them in music. Each phrase of each sentence, like an air or a recitative in music, should be so artfully compounded out of long and <b>short,</b> <b>out</b> of accented and unaccented, as to gratify the sensual ear. And of this the ear is the sole judge. It is impossible to lay down laws. Even in our accentual and rhythmic language no analysis can find {{the secret of the}} beauty of a verse; how much less, then, of those phrases, such as prose is built of, which obey no law but to be lawless and yet to please? The little that we know of verse (and for my part I owe it all to my friend Professor Fleeming Jenkin) is, however, particularly interesting in the present connection. We have been accustomed to describe the heroic line as five iambic feet, and to be filled with pain and confusion whenever, as by the conscientious schoolboy, we have heard our own description put in practice.|$|E
