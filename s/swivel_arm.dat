500|$|The Royal Navy's {{airborne}} {{early warning}} (AEW) capability had been lost when the Fairey Gannet aeroplane was withdrawn after {{the last of the}} RN's fleet carriers was decommissioned in 1978. During the Falklands War, a number of warships were lost and casualties suffered {{due to the lack of}} an AEW platform. The proposed fleet cover by the RAF Shackleton AEW.2 was too unresponsive and at too great a distance to be practical. Consequently, two Sea King HAS2s were modified in 1982 with the addition of the Thorn-EMI ARI 5980/3 Searchwater LAST radar attached to the fuselage on a <b>swivel</b> <b>arm</b> and protected by an inflatable dome. This allowed the radar to be lowered below the fuselage during flight and for it to be raised for landing. These prototypes, designated HAS2(AEW), were both flying within 11 weeks and deployed with 824 [...] "D" [...] Flight on HMS Illustrious, serving in the Falklands after the cessation of hostilities. A further eight HAS2s were modified to a production standard, known as the AEW2. Two remained [...] "fitted for but not with". [...] These entered operational service in 1985, being deployed by 849 Naval Air Squadron. Three Sea King HAS5/6s were later converted as part of the ASaC Mk7 programme, bringing the Mk7 fleet to 13; still 3 below the requirement.|$|E
50|$|The {{retirement}} of the Royal Navy's fleet carriers in 1978 {{meant that the}} airborne early warning (AEW) capable Fairey Gannet was also withdrawn from service. During the Falklands War, a number of warships were lost {{due to the lack}} of an indigenous AEW presence. Consequently, a greatly accelerated project was started to equip Westland Sea King helicopters with a slightly modified version of the system known as Searchwater LAST (Low Altitude Surveillance Task). The radome was mounted in a distinctive inverted cupola on a <b>swivel</b> <b>arm</b> attached to the right side of the fuselage just aft of the main door. This arm allowed the helicopter to lower the radar below the fuselage in flight and to raise it for landing.|$|E
5000|$|The discs pass, {{one at a}} time, {{into the}} metaliser, a small chamber at {{approximately}} 10−3 Torr (130 mPa) vacuum. The process is called 'sputtering'. The metaliser contains a metal [...] "target" [...] — almost always an alloy of (mostly) aluminium and small amounts of other metals. There is a load-lock system (similar to an airlock) so the process chamber can be kept at high vacuum as the discs are exchanged. When the disc is rotated into the processing position by a <b>swivel</b> <b>arm</b> in the vacuum chamber, a small dose of argon gas is injected into the process chamber and a 700 volt DC electric current at up to 20 kW {{is applied to the}} target. This produces a plasma from the target, and the plasma vapor is deposited onto the disc; it is an anode - cathode transfer. The metal coats the data side of the disc (upper surface), covering the pit and lands. This metal layer is the reflective surface which can be seen on the reverse (non label side) of a CD. This thin layer of metal is subject to corrosion from various contaminants and so is protected by a thin layer of lacquer.|$|E

40|$|During eye surgery, {{the surgeon}} uses an {{illuminating}} instrument called an opthalmoscope for {{close examination of}} the retina or {{the interior of the}} eye. Ordinarily, electric power for the head-mounted light is supplied through a cord from an overhead <b>swivel</b> <b>arm</b> or a floor pedestal. Within limits of cord length and <b>swivel</b> <b>arm</b> movement, the surgeon has considerable freedom of motion. But when more than one opthalmoscope is involved, tangling and interference of the power cords becomes a problem. St. Luke's Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio asked Lewis Research Center for assistance in finding a solution. Lewis responded with a battery-powered system that totally frees the surgeon of attached cords and swivels. Borrowing from space technology, Lewis used small, lightweight nickel-cadmium batteries that can deliver high intensity light for an hour and can be recharged overnight. The Opthalmoscope Powerpack consists of eight batteries in three containers affixed to a webbed belt, and a novel on-off switch equipped with a springloaded plexiglass "flapper. " The belt pack is worn underneath the surgical gown and the flapper permits the doctor to activate the switch by elbow pressure. Lewis built five units and they have been in service at St. Luke's Hospital for a year. Used for routine examinations as well as for surgery, they have demonstrated excellent reliability...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} the basic characteristics of behavior of nanofiber strain gauges and on the basis of experimental measurements to confirm the suitability of the design of the length sensors. There was a product designed with a <b>swivel</b> <b>arm</b> whose rotation burdens the nanofiber strain gauge affixed to the flat side of the cut. Some measurements were carried out to find out a suitable direction of the loading pressure and to reveal the area showing the linear behavior. This linear area is approximately between 44 ÷ 92 % of the range of the nanostrain gauge (0 % maximum load tensile, 100 % maximum load pressure). Other measurements dealt with temporal stability of the output value at each point. The outcome of these experiments {{was to determine the}} methodology and to propose the design of sensors for further tests, the aim of which was to develop a sensor for measuring small diameters (from 1 to 5 mm). ...|$|E
40|$|The {{safety of}} the {{personnel}} in industrial automation, where {{the man and the}} machine share the workplace and cooperate, is a significant issue. In this paper we analyze some aspects of the personnel safety in the cooperation with a 4 -axis <b>swivel</b> <b>arm</b> robot based on a 2 D/ 3 D imaging system. The robot and it’s surrounding environment is monitored by two cameras: a 3 D range imaging camera to measure the distance at high frame rate and a novel monocular hybrid 2 D/ 3 D vision system which fuses the low resolution range data with the high resolution 2 D imaging. The 2 D/ 3 D images are first pre-processed. The pre-processing consists of noise filtering, registration, calibration and range gauging. The pre-processed image sequences are then plugged into a detection and tracking system to detect and track the moving objects in the robot workspace which is a dynamic pre-defined vision volume. The decision, if a person is endangered or not, is used to control the operation of the robot. 1...|$|E

At 10:00 am on 15 June 1745, Donahew raised the British flag on his ship and a fierce two-hour battle ensued. Donahew reported firing at the four vessels two hundred rounds from his four pounders; fifty-three rounds from his three pounders, and [...] "my <b>swivel</b> and small <b>Arms</b> continually playing on them.” [...] The British reported there was a [...] "considerable slaughter" [...] of the French and natives.|$|R
5000|$|The Royalist was a 142-ton topsail schooner, {{comparable}} with HMS Pickle, which {{had brought the}} news of the Battle of Trafalgar home. She was probably built in Cowes in 1834 as a gentleman's yacht for Rev T.L. Lane, but purchased by James Brooke in 1836 with money he had inherited from his father. He intended to use it for an expedition to the East Indies {{in the course of a}} circumnavigation of the globe, in preparation for which he cruised in the Mediterranean in 1837. As a vessel of the Royal Yacht Squadron it was permitted to fly the White Ensign and be accorded the same rights as ships of the Royal Navy. When armed, with [...] "6 six-pounders, a number of <b>swivels,</b> and small <b>arms</b> in abundance," [...] Royalist was effectively a private warship. Royalist played an instrumental role in establishing Brooke's foothold in Sarawak, from his first visit in 1839 until he became the first White Rajah of Sarawak in 1841. The Royalist was last heard of in Brunei in September 1843, and is said to have been sold early in 1844.|$|R
5000|$|Matchlocks {{were the}} first and {{simplest}} firearms firing mechanisms developed. Using the matchlock mechanism, the powder in the gun barrel was ignited by a piece of burning cord called a [...] "match". The match was wedged into one end of an S-shaped piece of steel. As the trigger (often actually a lever) was pulled, the match was brought into the open end of a [...] "touch hole" [...] {{at the base of}} the gun barrel, which contained a very small quantity of gunpowder, igniting the main charge of gunpowder in the gun barrel. The match usually had to be relit after each firing. The main parts to the matchlock firing mechanism are the pan, match, arm and trigger. A benefit of the pan and <b>arm</b> <b>swivel</b> being moved to the side of the gun was it gave a clear line of fire. An advantage to the matchlock firing mechanism is that it did not misfire. However, it also came with some disadvantages. One disadvantage was if it was raining the match could not be kept lit to fire the weapon. Another issue with the match was it could give away the position of soldiers because of the glow, sound, and smell.|$|R
