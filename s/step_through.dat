Reyes is able to {{retrieve}} the license plate number on the truck used to kidnap the abductee. It is later revealed that it belongs to Travis Clayton Moberly, better known as Absalom, {{the leader of a}} doomsday cult. The FBI storms the cult's compound, and arrests Absalom, but Smith is not found. Absalom tells Scully and Doggett that he has been saving abductees that had been left for dead by the aliens.

The Princess destroys the rest of the drawings in Helena's room, preventing Helena from returning, and Helena and Valentine disappear in the collapsed world.

25|$|In 1304, the Emperor Trần Anh Tông {{decided to}} {{standardize}} the examination by four different rounds in which candidates were eliminated step by <b>step</b> <b>through</b> tests of classical texts, Confucianist classics, royal document redaction, and finally argument and planning. This examining process was abandoned in 1396 by the Emperor Trần Thuận Tông {{under pressure from}} Hồ Quý Ly, who replaced the traditional examination with the new version {{as a part of}} his radical reforms of the social and administrative system. Hồ Quý Ly regulated the imperial examination by a prefectural examination (thi hương) and a metropolitan examination (thi hội) following in the next year. The second-degree examination included four rounds: literary dissertation, literary composition, royal document redaction, and eventually an essay which was evaluated by the Emperor in person. It should be noted that for the lower-ranking officials, the emperor had another examination which tested writing and calculating, such as the examination in the sixth lunar month of 1261 during the reign of Trần Thánh Tông.|$|E
25|$|The film {{begins with}} the {{unearthing}} of the Stargate in Giza in 1928. In a present day, i.e., 1994, military base in Creek Mountain, Colorado, discredited Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) enables use of the Stargate when he recognizes that symbols on the cover stones of the Stargate are asterisms used in a three dimensional coordinate system. A team led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) is ordered to <b>step</b> <b>through</b> the Stargate and identify potential military threats on the other side. Jackson accompanies them to operate the other Stargate with {{his knowledge of the}} coordinate system. The team discovers a slave civilization serving an alien who is posing as the Egyptian god Ra (Jaye Davidson). Ra and his minions have taken human form, dominating the slaves with brute force. With the help of the locals, O'Neil's team is eventually able to instigate a slave rebellion, overwhelming Ra's forces. Ra escapes in his mothership, but O'Neil is able to teleport a nuclear warhead on-board Ra's ship in orbit and detonate it. With Ra dead, the civilization can live in peace; O'Neil and his team return home through the Stargate, but Daniel Jackson stays on the planet with a young local woman named Sha'uri.|$|E

500|$|Following Metallica's {{mainstream}} {{breakthrough in}} 1991, Mustaine stripped down Megadeth's sound, though the music remained as technically perfectionist as their previous releases. Drummer Nick Menza explained: [...] "Metallica has definitely {{opened the doors}} for other bands to <b>step</b> <b>through.</b> We're obviously the next band to <b>step</b> <b>through</b> that doorway." [...] Musically, Countdown to Extinction saw Megadeth beginning to incorporate more melody and mid-tempos into its traditional sound. Bassist David Ellefson noted that the band's goal was to [...] "create music that had more of a groove to it," [...] capitalizing on the melodic playing style employed by Friedman, and further assisted by the input of producer Norman. Author Thomas Harrison wrote that with this album, Megadeth's music became [...] "more virtuosic than noisy and took {{the next step towards}} widespread acceptance".|$|E

Such systems work best when the technical and social systems are deliberately developed together.|$|E

500|$|Arthur Jennings, who {{portrayed the}} clown [...] "Happy Dayze" [...] {{in the park}} during the 1950s, was an {{accomplished}} engineer who approached park management about creating Story Book Forest, a theme park based on [...] "emotion rather than motion". Jennings did {{much of the work}} himself, including life-sized models of fairy tales. The park, originally separate from Idlewild, opened in 1956. Story Book Forest featured many attractions such as a pirate ship, a castle, and many live storybook characters.

2500|$|A {{key element}} of the Swift system {{is its ability to}} be cleanly {{debugged}} and run within the development environment, using a read–eval–print loop (REPL), giving it interactive properties more in common with the scripting abilities of Python than traditional system programming languages. The REPL is further enhanced with the new concept playgrounds. These are interactive views running within the Xcode environment that respond to code or debugger changes on-the-fly. Playgrounds allow programmers to add in Swift code along with markdown documentation. If some code changes over time or with regard to some other ranged input value, the view can be used with the Timeline Assistant to demonstrate the output in an animated way. In addition, Xcode has debugging features for Swift development including breakpoints, <b>step</b> <b>through</b> and step over statements, as well as UI element placement breakdowns for app developers.|$|E

2500|$|An {{arpeggiator}} (arp) is {{a feature}} available on several synthesizers that automatically steps through {{a sequence of}} notes based on an input chord, thus creating an arpeggio. [...] The notes can often be transmitted to a MIDI sequencer for recording and further editing. [...] An arpeggiator may have controls for speed, range, and order in which the notes play; upwards, downwards, or in a random order. [...] More advanced arpeggiators allow the user to <b>step</b> <b>through</b> a pre-programmed complex sequence of notes, or play several arpeggios at once. [...] Some allow a pattern sustained after releasing keys: in this way, a sequence of arpeggio patterns may be built up over time by pressing several keys one after the other. Arpeggiators are also commonly found in software sequencers. [...] Some arpeggiators/sequencers expand features into a full phrase sequencer, which allows the user to trigger complex, multi-track blocks of sequenced data from a keyboard or input device, typically synchronized with the tempo of the master clock.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the narrow victory in the referendum, Chrétien started in late 1995 a new policy of [...] "tough love", also known as [...] "Plan B", where the federal government sought to discredit Quebec separatism by making it clear to the people of Quebec how difficult it would be leave Canada. Through Chrétien had promised to enshrine recognition of Quebec as a [...] "distinct society" [...] in the constitution in order to win the referendum, this promise was quickly forgotten in {{the aftermath}} of victory with Chrétien arguing that the very vocal opposition of Ontario Premier Mike Harris to amending the constitution to recognize Quebec as a [...] "distinct society" [...] made that impossible.

2500|$|On November 29, 1944, the {{procedure}} was first tried on an eighteen-month-old infant named Eileen Saxon. [...] The blue baby syndrome had made her lips and fingers turn blue, {{with the rest of}} her skin having a very faint blue tinge. [...] She could only take a few steps before beginning to breathe heavily. Because no instruments for cardiac surgery then existed, Thomas adapted the needles and clamps for {{the procedure}} from those in use in the animal lab. During the surgery itself, at Blalock's request, Thomas stood on a step stool at Blalock's shoulder and coached him step by <b>step</b> <b>through</b> the procedure. Thomas performed the operation hundreds of times on a dog, whereas Blalock only once as Thomas' assistant. The surgery was not completely successful, though it did prolong the infant's life for several months. Blalock and his team operated again on an 11-year-old girl, this time with complete success, and the patient was able to leave the hospital three weeks after the surgery. Next, they operated upon a six-year-old boy, who dramatically regained his color {{at the end of the}} surgery. The three cases formed the basis for the article that was published in the May 1945 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, giving credit to Blalock and Taussig for the procedure.
