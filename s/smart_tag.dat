Touch 'n Go and <b>Smart</b> <b>TAG,</b> have been made compulsory in all expressways since 1 July 2004, following the instruction of the Works Minister, Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu. Other electronic payment systems that were previously used by other highway operators such as PLUS TAG for all PLUS expressways network, Express TAG for Shah Alam Expressway, FasTrak for Damansara–Puchong Expressway and Sprint Expressway and SagaTag in Cheras–Kajang Expressway, were abolished in a move to standardise the electronic payment method.|$|E

The motivation for the research was to avoid over-engineering of the quality of the joints where this would correlate with too high costs. For the system with an ACP, the matrix material was identified as the critical factor whereas for the soldered system, the quality of the backplane appeared more critical than the soldered joints themselves. Draft specifications that were considered in this work were not met for the system with ACP whereas they were easily met for all tested soldered system...|$|R

The Accelerators interface was open to developers, and the accelerators included by default, which use Microsoft's or its affiliates' products, could be replaced within each category with another provider if desired.|$|R
