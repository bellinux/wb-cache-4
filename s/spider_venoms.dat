Possible medical uses for <b>spider</b> <b>venoms</b> are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction.

Worldwide only two <b>spider</b> <b>venoms</b> have impact on humans—those of the widow and recluse spiders. Unlike snake and scorpion envenomation, widow and recluse species bites rarely have fatal consequences. However, isolated spider families have a lethal neurotoxic venom: the wandering spider in Brazil and the funnel web in Australia. However, due to limited contact between these spiders and humans, deaths {{have always been}} rare, and since the introduction of anti-venom in Australia, {{there have been no}} funnel web related deaths.|$|E

50|$|The {{toxicity}} of the <b>spider’s</b> <b>venom</b> {{is affected by}} the sex of the spider. The male funnel-web <b>spider’s</b> <b>venom</b> appears to be six times more powerful than that of the female spider, based on minimum lethal dose determinations. In addition, different species of animals tend to react to the venom in various ways. For example, rats, rabbits and cats are unaffected by the bite of a female funnel-web spider, whereas for 20 percent of mice and guinea pigs the bite of a female was fatal. A bite of a male funnel-web spider, though, led to the death of almost all mice and guinea pigs. Although the male <b>spider’s</b> <b>venom</b> seems to be more potent, male spider bites cause mild transient effects in dogs and cats. Most primates, including humans, appear to be extremely sensitive to the funnel-web <b>spider’s</b> <b>venom.</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Spider</b> <b>venoms</b> work {{on one of}} two {{fundamental}} principles; they are either neurotoxic (attacking the nervous system) or necrotic (attacking tissues surrounding the bite). In some cases, the venom affects vital organs and systems. The venoms of the widow spiders, Brazilian wandering spider and Australian funnel-web are neurotoxic. Heart muscle damage is an unusual complication of widow venom {{that may lead to}} death. Pulmonary edema, which is fluid accumulation in the lungs, is a feared and potentially serious but uncommon complication of funnel-web venom. Recluse and South African sand <b>spider</b> <b>venoms</b> are necrotic. Recluse venom may also cause severe hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells), though this is typically uncommon.|$|E

25|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} bites include {{clearing}} clutter {{and the use}} of pesticides. Most spider bites are managed with supportive care such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including ibuprofen) for pain and antihistamines for itchiness. Opioids may be used if the pain is severe. While an antivenom exists for black widow <b>spider</b> <b>venom,</b> it is associated with anaphylaxis and therefore not commonly used in the United States. Antivenom against funnel web <b>spider</b> <b>venom</b> improves outcomes. Surgery may be required to repair the area of injured skin from some recluse bites.|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objective}} The <b>spider</b> <b>venom</b> may inspire new drugs to treat cancer. The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate the effects and mechanisms of <b>spider</b> <b>venom</b> on lung adenocarcinoma cell A 549. Methods The proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma A 549 cells was detected by MTT. The apoptosis rate was observed with MTT assay and flow cytometer. The activity of catalase was detected by colorimetry. The malondialdehyde (MDA) content was determined by improved thiobarbituric acid fluorometric method. The expression of P 38 MAPK protein was analyzed with Western blot. Results Spider venom can remarkably inhibite the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma A 549 cells, increased activity of catalase and MDA content, down-regulated expression of P 38 MAPK compared with the control group. Conclusion The reduced proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma A 549 cells by <b>spider</b> <b>venom</b> is may be associated with the increased of activity of catalase and MDA content and decreased expression of P 38 MAPK...|$|R

Adsorption of the dermonecrotic activity occurred following incubation with isolated membranes from different cell types or different species in a dose-responsive fashion. Since injection of the complex in rabbits produced skin necrosis, a specific antibody that inhibits the dermonecrotic activity and sphingomyelinase activity was used to identify the venom fraction on the plasma membrane of erythrocytes with electron microscopy.

50|$|The size of Palystes spiders, {{combined}} with the banding {{on the underside of}} the legs exposed when the spider is in threat pose, give them a fearsome appearance. An experiment was done in 1959 where a P. superciliosus was allowed to bite an adult guinea pig on the nose. The guinea pig died within 7 minutes, leading to a belief that the <b>spider's</b> <b>venom</b> was dangerous. However, further research on anaesthetized guinea pigs showed that the original guinea pig had actually died of shock, rather than as a result of the <b>spider's</b> <b>venom.</b> In humans a Palystes bite is no more dangerous than a bee sting. It causes a burning sensation, and swelling which lasts for a few days. Recovery is spontaneous and complete.|$|R
