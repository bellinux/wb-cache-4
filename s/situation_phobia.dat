40|$|Events {{associated}} with the danger can cause fear in pets. Fear can soon become a phobia. Phobia is a disproportionate fear to {{the danger of the}} real <b>situation.</b> <b>Phobia</b> is defined as a persistence, excessive and irrational fear response to the situation. Causes of noise phobia Noise phobia in dogs can be caused by gunshots, firecrackers, thunderstorms and even the sound of birds. For example, the events {{associated with}} the thunderstorms such as a change in barometric pressure, lightning, electrostatic disturbances, and even smells {{associated with the}} storms can cause noise phobia in dogs. In almost all instances, the fear of noises and storms escalates, worsening with each exposure. Soon the pet may become fearful of similar sounds or events associated with the noise. A dog afraid of gunshots may show fear at the mere sight of a hunting rifle or a pet afraid of thunder may also become afraid of rain. Signs of noise phobia Dogs may display different signs of noise phobias which include: Hiding (most common sign in cats), urinating, defecating, chewing, panting, pacing, trying to escape (digging, jumping through windows or going through walls, running away), drooling, seeking the owner, expressing anal glands, off feed, not listening to commands, trembling or shaking, dilated pupils, vocalizing (barking or meowing). Dogs with mild noise phobia become anxious, trembles, hide during thunderstorms and be afraid of to go out of door for hours even after the storms has passed. The mild noise phobia needs a treatment because generally phobia becomes worst with repeated exposure. Fear of thunderstorms and other forms of noise phobia are common problems in dogs. Administering medications along with changing the pet’s environment, and using behavior modification techniques can help ease the fear. Above all, do not give your pet any attention or reward when he is showing signs of fear; this will only reinforce the fearful behavior...|$|E
50|$|Phobias can {{be divided}} into {{specific}} phobias, social phobia, and agoraphobia. Types of specific phobias include to certain animals, natural environment situations, blood or injury, and specific situations. The most common are fear of spiders, fear of snakes, and fear of heights. Occasionally they are triggered by a negative experience with the object or <b>situation.</b> Social <b>phobia</b> is when the situation is feared as the person is worried about others judging them. Agoraphobia is when fear of a situation occurs because it is felt that escape would not be possible.|$|R
50|$|A phobia {{is a type}} {{of anxiety}} disorder, defined by a {{persistent}} fear of an object or <b>situation.</b> The <b>phobia</b> typically results in a rapid onset of fear and is present for more than six months. The affected person will {{go to great lengths to}} avoid the situation or object, typically to a degree greater than the actual danger posed. If the feared object or situation cannot be avoided, the affected person will have significant distress. With blood or injury phobia, fainting may occur. Agoraphobia is often associated with panic attacks. Usually a person has phobias to a number of objects or situations.|$|R
50|$|The least common {{category}} {{is an extension}} of agoraphobia, the anxiety of having a panic attack while being in crowds or public places. One manifestation of agoraphobia is the inability to travel long distances away from home. When driving, an agoraphobe may feel that he is putting himself into a fearful <b>situation,</b> and driving <b>phobia</b> may develop.|$|R
50|$|A {{specific}} phobia is a marked and persistent fear {{of an object}} or situation which brings about an excessive or unreasonable fear when in the presence of, or anticipating, a specific object; the {{specific phobia}}s may also include concerns with losing control, panicking, and fainting which is {{the direct result of}} an encounter with the phobia. Specific phobias are defined in relation to objects or <b>situations</b> whereas social <b>phobias</b> emphasize social fear and the evaluations that might accompany them.|$|R
50|$|To assess social phobia, {{psychologists and}} clinicians need to {{distinguish}} between performance anxiety and social interaction anxiety {{in order to make}} an accurate diagnosis. Social phobia was included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition (DSM-III). In the DSM-III-R and DSM-IV revisions, further expansion of the social phobia definition were included to better assess fears in social-interaction <b>situations.</b> Social <b>phobia</b> is defined by a persistent fear of embarrassment or negative evaluation while engaged in social interaction or public performance. However, lack of empirical data made it difficult to differentiate and relate different types of feared situations and social interactions. The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) was the first clinician-administered scale developed for the assessment of fear and avoidance associated with social phobia. The LSAS has a broad scope in assessment of both social interactions and performance/observation situations. Since its invention, the LSAS has been used in many cognitive-behavioral treatments of social phobia. The LSAS is the most frequently used form of social anxiety assessment in research, clinical-based, and pharmacotherapy studies.|$|R
5000|$|Children {{during their}} {{developmental}} stages experience fears. Fear {{is a natural}} part of self-preservation. Fears allow children to act with the necessary cautions to stay safe. [...] According to Child and Adolescent Mental Health, “such fears vary in frequency, intensity, and duration; they tend to be mild, age-specific, and transitory.” Fears can be a result of misperceptions. When a child perceives a threatening situation, his or her body experiences a fight or flight reaction. [...] Children placed in new situations with unfamiliar objects are more likely to experience such reactions. These fears should be passing, a result of childhood development. A childhood fear develops into a childhood phobia when it begins to interfere with daily living. [...] “Acute states of fear can elicit counterproductive physiological reactions such as trembling, profuse perspiration, faint feelings, weakness in joints and muscles, nausea, diarrhea, and disturbances in motor coordination” [...] It is not uncommon for frightened or anxious children to regress in a phase of development. For example, a kindergartener might begin to baby talk or wet the bed when faced with a threatening or particularly frightening <b>situation.</b> Childhood <b>phobias</b> exist in many different varieties and intensities and have a wide range from tolerable to incapacitating.|$|R
40|$|For {{those who}} {{experience}} symptoms of Blood, Injection, Injury (BII) <b>phobia,</b> <b>situations</b> involving blood and needles elicit clinical {{levels of anxiety}} and subsequent avoidance. This avoidance increases their risk for suboptimal health outcomes. Current interventions {{take the form of}} general information campaigns; a tailored, one-on-one approach targeting individuals in distress may demonstrate greater efficacy. Motivational Interviewing (MI) has demonstrated effectiveness across multiple behavior change domains. The current project first conducted formative elicitation research to help develop a single session, peer-delivered, motivational interview; we then used a randomized, controlled trial to test whether the newly developed intervention would evince changes in attitude, motivation, and behavior related to mental health help-seeking. Sixty-one participants were randomized to receive either the newly developed intervention or an information only control condition. Both groups exhibited similar changes in attitude and motivation, however, a 2 (groups) by 3 (time points) ANCOVA test revealed an overall effect of time on average motivation scores (F= 4. 910, p=. 01) and a time by group interaction effect (F= 3. 881, p=. 03) indicating that the two groups exhibited different patterns of change. Secondary effect size analysis provided evidence for a more sustained effect in the intervention condition relative to control in both motivation and attitude measures. At one month follow up, participants in the intervention condition reported greater numbers of help seeking behavior (IR= 2. 46; 95 %CI= 1. 40, 4. 35; p=. 002). The intervention was considered acceptable by the participants and feasible to conduct using peer-facilitators. This preliminary pilot provides support for the use of MI in this context...|$|R
40|$|Virtual Reality and Video {{games are}} {{becoming}} a {{part of everyday life}} and culture. In addition to their entertainment value, modern computer games are provided with Game Level Editors (GLE) which allow the user to create customized Virtual Environments (VE). Although they are inexpensive, GLE’s graphic, animation and realistic features can match professional software and allow the user to be immersed into a 3 D environment. In a therapeutic framework, GLE’s VEs combined with virtual reality have been used in many fields including psychotherapy and more particularly exposure therapy, a procedure which aims to reduce phobic anxiety through confrontation with the feared situation. However, GLEs differ from each other in the possibilities of navigation, the number of options for creation, the power of the engine, and the flexibility of the Artificial Intelligence. In the present study, criteria for selecting the most relevant GLE for the construction of VEs related to Virtual Reality Exposure Based Therapy for one particular anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, are outlined. For agoraphobia, namely the fear of being in places where escape might be impossible or embarrassing, features the most various avoided <b>situations</b> among all <b>phobias,</b> it was selected to determine VEs requirements and to investigate different commercially available GLEs. Based on these criteria, the selected GLE Sandbox 2 (Crytek GmbH) was utilized to construct 9 distinct virtual situations in which samples of 18 agoraphobics were immersed. Within each VE, the participants contended with their least feared situation and their most feared one. Self report questionnaires as well as measures of heart rate and heart rate variability demonstrated increased fear levels within the feared virtual environments. Reported level of presence also indicated a patent involvement in the VEs and a clear immersive effect. There was a significant correlation between presence and anxiety. These data indicate that GLE’s artificial worlds combined with VR offers a viable possibility to establish a therapeutic environment at an affordable cost. 10 page(s...|$|R
