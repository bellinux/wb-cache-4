The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the changes in molecular weight and allergenicty of soybean grobogan variety and bambara groundnut proteins due to heat processing, i. e. boiling, <b>steaming,</b> <b>oven,</b> and roasting protein isolate was prepared by pH adjusting. SDS-PAGE method was used to determine the profile of protein molecular weight and the alergenicity was determined by ELISA method. Protein molecular weight profile of grobogan soybean and bambara groundnut that have been boiled, steamed, ovened, and roasted for 30 minutes showed variations when compared to the unheated soybean and bambara groundnut protein isolate. The amount of protein detected was reduced compared with unheated soybean and bambara groundnut. The protein allergens in grobogan soybean had molecular weight 110. 0, 98. 3, 84. 5, 67. 4, and 60. 2. The heat treatment for 30 minutes removed allergenicity as indicated by no detectable protein band in immunoblotting results and the smaller Optical Density value compared with unheated soybean. Thus, the allergenicity of soybean protein due to heat processing was minimized. Bambara groundnut had protein allergens with molecular weight 113. 1, 59. 8, and 25. 2 kDa. Protein allergen with molecular weight 25. 2 and 59. 8 kDa were detected in bambara groundnut processed through boiling and steaming for 30 minutes, respectively, but ELISA result showed there were still protein allergen of bambara groundnut after the heat treatment for 30 minutes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this study, the {{variations}} in fat, fatty acid composition, and lipid oxidation of chicken sausage during superheated steam and conventional drying oven (hot air oven) were investigated. Different superheated steam drying temperature (140 - 170 °C) was applied at various time domains (22 - 40) min. The hot air oven temperature was 105 °C, and the drying time was between 16 - 18 h. Statistical analysis was performed to precisely identify the efficacy in the fat, fatty acid, and lipid oxidation. The results revealed that at a temperature below 170 ° C, {{there was no significant}} difference in fat content when superheated steam was applied in drying. Applying the hot air drying was producing the highest amount of SFA as compared to their values in the superheated steam. While, the proportion of PUFA and MUFA values were maximized in superheated steam drying especially at temperatures between (160 - 170 ℃). Conventional drying oven significantly had higher value of lipid oxidation as indicated by peroxide value, p- anisidine value and Totox value than superheated <b>steam</b> <b>oven.</b> The results indicated superheated <b>steam</b> drying <b>oven</b> has efficiently improved the quality of the analysis as well as it decreased the drying time...|$|R

40|$|Many {{industrial}} processes require high amounts of steam. Design {{and operation of}} steam plants are particularly complex when the steam supply is required for short periods and with a varying time schedules. To fulfil the discontinuous needs of steam users, avoiding the steam boiler oversizing to the peak value of the steam request, a thermal energy storage (TES) system can be adopted. The proper sizing of TES systems, which, in this application, is constituted by a steam accumulator vessel installed between the steam generator and the consumer, cannot {{be based on the}} sole initial and final state conditions of the steam storage, since a performance prediction of the process time-evolution is also required. In this paper, a model of steam batch processes for industrial thermal treatments, able to describe unsteady operative conditions, is presented. More in detail, a three-stage steam plant, with a sequentially interconnected steam boiler, steam accumulator and processing tank, has been considered. The dynamic model of the charging and discharging processes of the steam accumulator has been applied to a real case study in the food industry: the batch debacterisation process of cocoa beans. Nevertheless, the obtained results can be profitably employed in the design and the performance assessments of a wide set of applications involving the steam processing fluid, such as desalination plants, solar thermal power plants, retorts, <b>steam</b> <b>ovens</b> and others...|$|R

Its design (based on life-cycle principles) brings the customer demand (number, type and timings of meals served) during typical, peak and special weeks together with the food storage, warewashing, ventilation, cooking and hot holding appliance capacities, carbon emissions and energy usage in various states. An assessment of separate and specific behavioural, equipment maintenance, preparation and cooking strategies are performed. The baseline energy use results were validated to within 0. 65 % of the findings from an extensive and detailed monitoring study of a leading operator of UK public houses and restaurants [1]. Seven energy reduction scenarios were then assessed using the developed calculator.

Limited studies reported the application of this process in aquacultural products (Espinosa et al., 2016; Shakila et al., 2009), such as trout fillets (Gonzalez-Fandos et al., 2004), 2009) and carp (Can, 2011) {{and there are no}} reports on the opportunities to apply such process to molluscs. The aim of the present research was to test the effect of the application of the SVCC technique on fresh mussel microbiological characteristics. Commercial Mediterranean mussels (M. galloprovincialis) were individually inoculated with 100 µl suspension of Pseudomonas spp. (107 UFC/mL), packaged in a Oriented Polyamide/Polypropylene (OPA/PP, Orved S. p. A., Musile di Piave, VE, Italy) pouch and heat-sealed before being submitted to heat treatment in a <b>steam</b> <b>oven</b> (Lanoix Ali S. p. A., Treviso, Italy). After treatment, mussel pouches were immediately chilled at 3 °C. Six different time temperature combinations (75 / 85 / 95 °C for 10 and 30 min), were tested in triplicate (3 specimens/group) and compared to raw and inoculated mussels. Total aerobic bacterial count (TBC), lactic acid bacteria (LAB), anaerobic sulphite-reducing clostridia, Pseudomonas spp. and pH were determined. All time/temperature combinations resulted in a substantial reduction of the Pseudomonas spp. population (< 1 log CFU/g) both in raw (4. 9 log CFU/g) and experimentally inoculated (5. 7 log CFU/g) mussels. The homogenate pH values (6. 22) resulted not affected by the heat treatment. Such results were confirmed on natural bacterial load of mussel. A TBC reduction (2. 4 log and 3, 5 log, respectively) was registered after treatment at 85 °C both for 10 and 30 min, while the highest reduction (4. 8 log) was observed at 95 °C for 10 min confirming the efficacy of sous vide cook treatments even for fresh mussels.

50|$|Food {{processing}} {{dates back}} to the prehistoric ages when crude processing incorporated fermenting, sun drying, preserving with salt, and various types of cooking (such as roasting, smoking, <b>steaming,</b> and <b>oven</b> baking), Such basic food processing involved chemical enzymatic changes to the basic structure of food in its natural form, as well served to build a barrier against surface microbial activity that caused rapid decay. Salt-preservation was especially common for foods that constituted warrior and sailors' diets until the introduction of canning methods.

50|$|Foods cook {{much faster}} with {{pressure}} cooking than with other methods (except for small quantities in microwave ovens). Pressure cooking requires much less water than conventional boiling, so food can be ready sooner. Less energy is required {{than that of}} boiling, <b>steaming,</b> or <b>oven</b> cooking. Since less water or liquid has to be heated, the food reaches its cooking temperature faster. Using more liquid than necessary wastes energy because it takes longer to heat up; the liquid quantity is stated in the recipe. Pressure cookers can use much less liquid than the amount required for boiling or steaming in an ordinary saucepan. It {{is not necessary to}} immerse food in water. The minimum quantity of water or liquid used in the recipe to keep the pressure cooker filled with steam is sufficient. Because of this, vitamins and minerals are not leached (dissolved) away by water, as they would be if food were boiled in large amounts of water. Due to the shorter cooking time, vitamins are preserved relatively well during pressure cooking.|$|R
