With the exception of <b>stress-relieving,</b> <b>tempering,</b> and aging, most heat treatments begin by heating an alloy beyond the upper transformation (A3) temperature. This temperature {{is referred to as}} an [...] "arrest" [...] because at the A3 temperature the metal experiences a period of hysteresis. At this point, all of the heat energy is used to cause the crystal change, so the temperature stops rising for a short time (arrests) and then continues climbing once the change is complete. Therefore, the alloy must be heated above the critical temperature for a transformation to occur. The alloy will usually be held at this temperature long enough for the heat to completely penetrate the alloy, thereby bringing it into a complete solid solution.|$|R

40|$|Robotic {{friction}} stir welding {{experiments were}} performed on AA 5754 aluminium alloy sheets, 2. 5 mm in thickness, in two different <b>temper</b> <b>states</b> (H 111 and O-annealed). A six axes robot with a hybrid structure, characterised by an arm with parallel kinematics and a roll-pitch-roll wrist with serial kinematics, was used. The effect of the process parameters on the macro- and micro-mechanical properties and microstructure of joints was widely analysed. It was shown that, under the same process condition, the mechanical properties of the joints are strongly influenced by the initial <b>temper</b> <b>state</b> of the alloy. In particular, as AA 5754 -H 111 is welded, the ultimate tensile strength is not significantly affected by the process parameters whilst the ultimate elongation significantly depends on the welding speed. In AA 5754 -O, both ultimate values of tensile strength and elongation {{are affected by the}} welding speed whilst a negligible effect of the rotational speed can be observed.

The main aim of the present work is therefore to investigate the effects of long time natural ageing on fatigue life under constant amplitude loading in ambient air, i. e. for alloys AA 6082 and AA 7108. The extruded AA 6082 and AA 7108 alloys have been investigated in four different <b>temper</b> <b>states,</b> T 1, T 4, T 5 and T 6. The T 1 and T 4 tempers represents naturally aged conditions at different storage times, i. e. more than 10 years and 3 weeks, respectively. The T 5 and T 6 tempers represents artificially aged conditions. The fatigue testing was performed as one-axial, high cycle fatigue, with the fatigue properties between 105 and 106 cycles to failure in focus. The relationship between fatigue strength and non-strength providing parameters such as the recrystallized layer, surface roughness, crystallographic texture and humidity have been accounted for. The different precipitated particles, providing strength, have also been considered, as they have a direct effect on the fatigue strength. To underline the fatigue properties, hardness change due to cyclic loading was measured and finally fractured surfaces were investigated. The results show that stored {{aluminium alloys}} can gain ultimate tensile strengths comparable to heat treated conditions. Never the less, it is not always a direct relation between high tensile properties and good fatigue properties. Further, the results reveal that the naturally aged <b>temper</b> <b>state</b> (T 4) and the stored <b>temper</b> <b>state</b> (T 1) have the best fatigue properties. In addition, for both alloys, the peak aged condition, T 6, has the poorest fatigue properties...|$|R

In this paper, we focus on the effect of different carbide morphologies in the initial microstructure on the fatigue behavior after high pressure torsion (HPT) treatment of SAE 1045 steels. The two initial carbide morphologies are spheroidized as well as <b>tempered</b> <b>states.</b> The HPT processing increased the hardness of the spheroidized and <b>tempered</b> <b>states</b> from 169 HV and 388 HV to a maximum of 511 HV and 758 HV, respectively. The endurance limit increased linearly with hardness up to about 500 HV independent of the carbide morphology. The fracture surfaces revealed mostly flat fatigue fracture surfaces with crack initiation at the surface or, more often, at non-metallic inclusions. Morphology and crack initiation mechanisms were changed by the severe plastic deformation. The residual fracture surface of specimens with spheroidal initial microstructures showed well-defined dimple structures also after HPT at high fatigue limits and high hardness values.

40|$|The {{approach}} {{based on}} the strain energy density (SED) averaged over a control volume is first used to summarise uniaxial and multi-axial fatigue strength data of welded joints made of structural steels and aluminium alloys. In all welded joints, the weld toe and weld root regions are modelled like sharp, zero radius. V-notches with different opening angles. The control volume radius is 0. 28 mm for structural steels, 0. 12 mm for aluminium alloys.

40|$|In {{order to}} keep the overall length of the compact linear {{collider}} (CLIC), currently being studied at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), within reasonable limits, i. e. less than 50 km, an accelerating gradient above 100 MV/m is required. This imposes considerable demands on the materials of the accelerating structures. The internal surfaces of these core components of a linear accelerator are exposed to pulsed radio frequency (RF) currents resulting in cyclic thermal stresses expected to cause surface damage by fatigue. The designed lifetime of CLIC is 20 years, which results in a number of thermal stress cycles of the order of 2. 33 · 1010. Since no fatigue data existed in the literature for CLIC parameter space, a set of three complementary experiments were initiated: ultra high cycle mechanical fatigue by ultrasound, low cycle fatigue by pulsed laser irradiation and low cycle thermal fatigue by high power microwaves, each test representing a subset of the original problem. High conductivity copper alloys in different <b>temper</b> <b>states</b> and several techniques to improve their fatigue life were investigated.

The objective in this work {{is to examine the}} microstructure and the mechanical properties, in order to further determine if the profiles behaves as expected. Both flat profiles and 2 -chamber box profiles are studied. Three Al-Mg-Si alloys: C 20 -Y 1, C 24 -X 1 and C 28 -C 2 are inspected in this study. These are evaluated in three different tempers states: T 4 /W, T 6 and T 7. The characterization of the microstructure by light optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy is completed. In addition, the mechanical properties of the materials are considered through tensile and bending tests. The characterization showed a fully recrystallized microstructure in the C 20 -Y 1 alloy, and fibrous microstructure in the C 24 -X 1 and C 28 -C 2 alloy. A typical deformation texture is observed in the two fibrous alloys. The recrystallized C 20 -Y 1 alloy displays a strong cube texture. Large primary particles are present in the C 28 -C 2 alloy, and the smallest particles are seen in the C 20 -Y 1 alloy. For all alloys the particles are elongated in the extrusion direction. C 28 -C 2 displayed a loss of strength in T 7 -state compared to the other materials, presumably the highly alloyed profile reaches peak strength earlier.

The material behaviour implemented in the model has been rationalised from experiments done on near pearlitic wheel steels, however the qualitative results are deemed applicable also for local thermal damage on pearlitic rail steels. The material is currently modelled as isotropic, with properties varying with phase, temperature and <b>tempering</b> <b>state.</b> The main contributions of this work is the modelling framework developed, specifically the careful modelling of martensite tempering combined with phase transformation. Different thermal sequences are examined to demonstrate the model´s capability. The computed strength and stress fields are used to discuss possible mechanisms of crack initiation...|$|R
