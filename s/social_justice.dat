5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise <b>social</b> <b>justice,</b> {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that <b>social</b> <b>justice</b> and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on <b>Social</b> <b>Justice,</b> set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of <b>social</b> <b>justice</b> were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed <b>social</b> <b>justice</b> primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E
