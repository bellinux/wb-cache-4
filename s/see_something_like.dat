500|$|Starting on September 29, 1983, a {{layer of}} {{concrete}} was poured {{on top of the}} crushed materials, a rare occurrence in waste disposal. An anonymous workman's stated reason for the concrete was: [...] "There are dead animals down there. We wouldn't want any children to get hurt digging in the dump." [...] Eventually, the city began to protest the large amount of dumping Atari was doing, with one commissioner stating that the area did not want to become [...] "an industrial waste dump for El Paso." [...] The local manager ordered the dumping to be ended shortly afterwards. Due to Atari's unpopular dumping, Alamogordo later passed an Emergency Management Act and created the Emergency Management Task Force to limit the future flexibility of the garbage contractor to secure outside business for the landfill for monetary purposes. Alamogordo's then mayor, Henry Pacelli, commented that, [...] "We do not want to <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this happen again." ...|$|E
500|$|The diverse {{sources of}} funding {{meant that the}} {{production}} team had to field opinions from various sources. Millesime was unhappy with {{certain aspects of the}} story, for instance wanting the entire Lyme sequence removed because they considered it [...] "too boring". WGBH gave the BBC detailed notes, which were then integrated into the script. One change concerned the ending. To display the climax when Anne and Wentworth finally approach each other with their feelings, two different scenes were shot, one in which they kiss and one in which they do not. Dear first wrote a scene closely modelled after Austen's ending: Anne reunites with Wentworth on the streets of Bath, and the two exchange words and hold hands. Eaton felt that after hours of waiting, audiences [...] "would go nuts with frustration and irritation" [...] if the two did not kiss. Eaton also thought [...] "a kiss would be an emotional pay-off", and WGBH believed it would give the film a wider appeal. Michell agreed to compromise, opting to shoot one British version and one American version—the latter included the kiss. The American ending is reflected on the international poster, which shows the two protagonists embracing. While the kiss attracted some criticism among fans, actress Amanda Root defended it. [...] "After the great suspense of the story, by the end you're desperate for Anne and Captain Wentworth to get together, desperate! Film is a visual medium, after all. You don't necessarily want to see them in bed together, but you do want to <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a kiss", she said.|$|E
500|$|The {{shooting}} script features {{a scene in}} Angela's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty; the scene differed from earlier versions, which set it as a [...] "big scene on a freeway" [...] in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body. The change was a practical decision, as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs. The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash, but only half a day was available. Ball agreed, {{but only if the}} scene could retain a line of Ricky's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman: [...] "When you <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can look right back." [...] Jane asks: [...] "And what do you see?" [...] Ricky: [...] "Beauty." [...] Ball said, [...] "They wanted to cut that scene. They said it's not important. I said, 'You're out of your fucking mind. It's {{one of the most important}} scenes in the movie!' If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie, that is the line." [...] Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence; set in a schoolyard, it presents a [...] "turning point" [...] for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela. By the end of filming, the script had been through 10 drafts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first game}} of the 2008 season saw Brady suffer a torn ACL in his left knee while {{attempting}} a pass to Randy Moss. The play occurred in the first half against the Kansas City Chiefs when safety Bernard Pollard dove at Brady's leg while in his throwing motion. Moss described what he saw on the play by saying [...] "any time you <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that, that looks foul, it looks dirty, it opens your eyes. So, me personally, it looked dirty." [...] Matt Cassel replaced Brady {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

'There is {{something}} in that boy's face,' said the old gentleman {{to himself as he}} walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of the book, in a thoughtful manner; 'something that touches and interests me.

The white thing came down lower and lower, {{and then all of a}} sudden it stood in the mud and said, [...] "Ow!" ...|$|E

I am not, indeed, {{under his}} command--being {{what you may}} call a sort of freelance--but I work with him chiefly, that is, under his directions, for he and I hold much the same ideas in regard to most things, and have a common desire to <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> solid peace in the land.

He ran between the trees towards the Observatory. “As fast as my legs would carry me,” he repeated twice.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Oberman became {{engaged to}} music {{producer}} Rob Cowan. The couple were honeymooning in Thailand when the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami struck.

It also showed me the incredible generosity people are capable of. When you have <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that, you also stop taking the trivia so seriously".|$|R
60|$|Paddy the Beaver kept {{right on}} working just as if he hadn't any visitors. You see, {{it is a big}} {{undertaking}} to build a dam. And when that was done there was a house to build and a supply of food for the winter to cut and store. Oh, Paddy the Beaver had no time for idle gossip, you may be sure! So he {{kept right on}} building his dam. It didn't look much like a dam at first, and some of Paddy's visitors turned up their noses when they first saw it. They had heard stories of what a wonderful dam-builder Paddy was, and they had expected to <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> the smooth, grass-covered bank with which Farmer Brown kept the Big River from running back on his low lands. Instead, all they saw was a great pile of poles and sticks which looked like anything but a dam.|$|E
6000|$|When {{they came}} to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman, at the same moment {{preparing}} to come down, politely drew back, and stopped to give them way. They ascended and passed him; and as they passed, Anne's face caught his eye, and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of. She was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye which it had also produced. It was evident that the gentleman, (completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly. Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it. He gave her a momentary glance, a glance of brightness, which seemed to say, [...] "That man is struck with you, and even I, at this moment, <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> Anne Elliot again." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{great man}} smiled. 'Thou art not {{altogether}} right, Macumazahn,' he said; 'I have plotted in my time, {{but it was}} not ambition that led me to my fall; but, shame on me that I should have to say it, a fair woman's face. Let it pass. So we are going to <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> the old times again, Macumazahn, when we fought and hunted in Zululand? Ay, I will come. Come life, come death, what care I, so that the blows fall fast and the blood runs red? I grow old, I grow old, and I have not fought enough! And yet am I a warrior among warriors; see my scars' -- and he pointed to countless cicatrices, stabs and cuts, that marked the skin of his chest and legs and arms. 'See the hole in my head; the brains gushed out therefrom, yet did I slay him who smote, and live. Knowest thou how many men I have slain, in fair hand-to-hand combat, Macumazahn? See, here is the tale of them' -- and he pointed to long rows of notches cut in the rhinoceros-horn handle of his axe. 'Number them, Macumazahn -- one hundred and three -- and I have never counted but those whom I have ripped open {Endnote 3}, nor have I reckoned those whom another man had struck.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, me!' {{said the}} lady, ''tis not the bright-faced prince whom I hold {{to be one}} of us. No, no, my Cypros. Think awhile, sweet girl. The visage, the head of the other, have you not seen them before? Have you not <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> them? That head so proudly placed upon the shoulders; that hair, that hyacinthine hair, that lofty forehead, that proud lip, that face so refined and yet so haughty, does it not recall anything? Think, Cypros; think!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Perkins {{seized the}} grant impatiently, {{and ran his}} eye quickly over the interlineations between the printed portions. [...] "Strange!" [...] he muttered. [...] "This is not my own nor Sanchez; nor Ruiz; {{it is a new}} hand. Ah! what have we here--a {{correction}} in the date--in still another hand? And this--surely I have <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> it in the office. But where?" [...] He stopped, ran his fingers through his hair, but after an effort at recollection abandoned the attempt. [...] "But why?" [...] he said, abruptly, [...] "why should this be forged?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The other {{picture was}} that of a man nailed to a cross, which {{surprised}} Tom much. He fancied that he had <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> it in a shop-window. But why was it there? [...] "Poor man," [...] thought Tom, [...] "and he looks so kind and quiet. But why should the lady have such a sad picture as that in her room? Perhaps it was some kinsman of hers, who had been murdered by the savages in foreign parts, and she kept it there for a remembrance." [...] And Tom felt sad, and awed, and turned to look at something else.|$|R
60|$|So the Lord sent {{to those}} Corinthians the {{very sort of}} proof which they wanted, by {{the hand of the}} learned apostle, St. Paul. They were great {{observers}} of the works of nature, of the strange movement and change, birth and death, which goes on in beasts, and in plants, and in the clouds, and the rivers, and the very stones under our feet. And they said, We cannot believe in the resurrection of the dead, because we see nothing like it in the world around us. And St. Paul was sent to tell them. No: you do <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> it. If you will look deeper into the working of the world around you, you will see that the rising again of the dead, instead of being an unnatural or an absurd thing, is the most reasonable and natural thing, the perfect fulfilment, and crowning wonder of wonderful laws which are working round you in every seed which you sow; in the flesh of beasts and fishes; in bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial: and so in that glorious chapter which we read in the Burial Service, St. Paul tells the Corinthians, who went altogether by sense, and reasoning about the things which they could see and handle, that sense and reasoning were on his side, on God's side; and that the mysteries of faith, like the resurrection of the body, were not contrary to reason, but agreed with it.|$|E
60|$|Silverado {{platform}} {{filled the}} whole {{width of the}} canyon. Above, as I have said, this was a wild, red, stony gully in the mountains; but below it was a wooded dingle. And through this, I was told, there had gone a path between the mine and the Toll House--our natural north-west passage to civilization. I found and followed it, clearing my way as I went through fallen branches and dead trees. It went straight down that steep canyon, till it brought you out abruptly over the roofs of the hotel. There was nowhere any break in the descent. It almost seemed as if, were you to drop a stone down the old iron chute at our platform, it would never rest until it hopped upon the Toll House shingles. Signs were not wanting of the ancient greatness of Silverado. The footpath was well marked, and had been well trodden in the old clays by thirsty miners. And far down, buried in foliage, deep {{out of sight of}} Silverado, I came on a last outpost of the mine--a mound of gravel, some wreck of wooden aqueduct, and the mouth of a tunnel, like a treasure grotto in a fairy story. A stream of water, fed by the invisible leakage from our shaft, and dyed red with cinnabar or iron, ran trippingly forth out of the bowels of the cave; and, looking far under the arch, I could <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> an iron lantern fastened on the rocky wall. It was a promising spot for the imagination. No boy could have left it unexplored.|$|E
60|$|But that Tom {{was a most}} {{wonderful}} person, she had no doubt. He had conquered her heart--so she informed herself passionately again and again; as was very necessary, seeing that the passion, having no real life of its own, required {{a good deal of}} blowing to keep it alight. Yes, he had conquered her heart, and he was conquering all hearts likewise. There must be some mystery about him--there should be. And she settled in her novel-bewildered brain, that Tom must be a nobleman in disguise--probably a foreign prince exiled for political offences. Bah! perhaps too many lines have been spent on the poor little fool; but as such fools exist, and people must be as they are, there is no harm in drawing her; and in asking, too--Who will help those young girls of the middle class who, like Miss Heale, are often really less educated than the children of their parents' workmen; sedentary, luxurious, full of petty vanity, gossip, and intrigue, without work, without purpose, except that of getting married to any one who will ask them--bewildering brain and heart with novels, which, after all, one hardly grudges them; for what other means have they of learning that there is any fairer, nobler life possible, at least on earth, than that of the sordid money-getting, often the sordid puffery and adulteration, which is the atmosphere of their home? Exceptions there are, in thousands, doubtless; and the families of the great city tradesmen, stand, of course, on far higher ground, and are often far better educated, and more high-minded, than the fine ladies, their parents' customers. But, till some better plan of education than the boarding-school is devised for them; till our towns shall <b>see</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> in kind to, though sounder and soberer in quality than, the high schools of America; till in country villages the ladies who interest themselves about the poor will recollect that the farmers' and tradesmen's daughters are just as much in want of their influence as the charity children, and will yield a far richer return for their labour, though the one need not interfere with the other; so long will England be full of Miss Heales; fated, when they marry, to bring up sons and daughters as sordid and unwholesome as their mothers.|$|E
60|$|Perplexities {{were also}} among the {{variations}} of entertainment {{to which they were}} frequently treated. Sometimes these were more or less cleared up after the assembled wit and wisdom of the community had frowned and bitten their nails over them for several hours. Others were of a nature which it passed the wit of man--Eskimo man at least--to unravel. A few of these, like the watch, had some light thrown on them by Nazinred, who had either <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> them in use among the fur-traders, or whose sagacity led him to make a shrewd occasional guess.|$|R

No doubt they are pleased to oblige the Duke of Burgundy, but, beyond that, their welcome seemed really sincere. Now let us see our bedroom. I suppose that is yours, Charlie, through the door in the corner." ...|$|R
