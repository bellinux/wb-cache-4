The place was so plain after the {{comparative}} luxury of Elmhurst, and {{especially of the}} rose chamber Patsy had occupied, {{that the old man}} could not fail to marvel at the girl's ecstatic joy to find herself in the old tenement again. There was one good sized living-room, with an ancient rag-carpet partially covering the floor, a sheet-iron stove, a sofa, a table and three or four old-fashioned chairs that had probably come from a <b>second-hand</b> <b>dealer.</b>|$|E

60|$|On the self-same evening Jude {{sat in his}} lodgings by the Close Gate. Often at {{this hour}} after dusk he would enter the silent Close, and stand {{opposite}} the house that contained Sue, and watch {{the shadows of the}} girls' heads passing to and fro upon the blinds, and wish he had nothing else to do but to sit reading and learning all day what many of the thoughtless inmates despised. But to-night, having finished tea and brushed himself up, he was deep in the perusal of the Twenty-ninth Volume of Pusey's Library of the Fathers, a set of books which he had purchased of a <b>second-hand</b> <b>dealer</b> at a price that seemed to him to be one of miraculous cheapness for that invaluable work. He fancied he heard something rattle lightly against his window; then he heard it again. Certainly somebody had thrown gravel. He rose and gently lifted the sash.|$|E
6000|$|His clothes wasn't bad, {{what there}} was of 'em. His dressing-case was poor,--not a {{particle}} of silver stopper,--bottle apertures with nothing in 'em, like empty little dog-kennels,--and a most searching description of tooth-powder diffusing itself around, as under a deluded mistake that all the chinks in the fittings was divisions in teeth. His clothes I parted with, well enough, to a <b>second-hand</b> <b>dealer</b> not far from St. Clement's Danes, in the Strand,--him as the officers in the Army mostly dispose of their uniforms to, when hard pressed with debts of honour, if I may judge from their coats and epaulets diversifying the window with their backs towards the public. The same party bought in one lot the portmanteau, the bag, the desk, the dressing-case, the hat-box, the umbrella, strap, and walking-stick. On my remarking that I should have thought those articles not quite in his line, he said: [...] "No more ith a man'th grandmother, Mithter Chrithtopher; but if any man will bring hith grandmother here, and offer her at a fair trifle below what the'll feth with good luck when the'th thcoured and turned--I'll buy her!" ...|$|E

40|$|Defence date: 7 June 1996 Examining board: Prof. Franco Angiolini, Università degli Studi di Pisa (supervisor); Prof. Laurence Fontaine, European University Institute and CNRS, Paris; Dr. Richard Mackenney, University of Edinburgh (external supervisor); Prof. Paolo Malanima, Università degli Studi di Pisa; Prof. Daniel Roche, Institut d'Histoire Moderne et Contemporaine, CNRS, ParisFirst made {{available}} online on 10 September 2013. The object {{of this study}} is to reinstate the market in second-hand clothes and furnishings within the hi story of Venice from c. 1500 to c. 1650. The discussion focuses on the Venetian guild of <b>second-hand</b> <b>dealers,</b> a number of 'alternative' exchanges of used goods, and a group of Jewish <b>second-hand</b> <b>dealers</b> who became established in Venice in the early sixteenth century. Particular attention is paid to the issues of guild exclusivism and the inelasticity of craft structures within the market for used goods. There are seven chapters. Chapter 1 explores the notion that the guild of <b>second-hand</b> <b>dealers</b> was traditional 1 y important in the market but did not have complete control, and Chapter 2 investigates various 'alternative' exchanges coexisting with the guild. In the next three chapters, these basic structures are examined in detail and their development is charted over the period as a whole. In Chapter 3, traders within the second-hand market are considered and the new group of Jewish competitors is introduced. The craft activities of the guild members and the Jewish dealers are analysed in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, a study is made of outlets for used goods and of their distribution within the city. The last two chapters assess the impact of two types of setbacks: outbreaks of plague, and a seventeenth-century recession in the used-goods market...|$|R

In 1949, he discovered painting and handicrafts, and began his first works.In 1969 Feješ died in Novi Sad, leaving behind many buttons and combs, and hundreds of pictures that are much admired for their lack of inhibition and universal appeal.|$|E
40|$|This modest book {{examines}} {{the world of}} petty entrepreneurs in a late medieval Italian town. It {{is based on a}} rare collection of 46 account books from small tradesmen in the archives of Prato, a town better known for the extraordinarily rich archive of business and personal records left by the wealthy merchant Francesco Datini. The author was guided in his study by Richard Goldthwaite, a leading expert on late medieval account books. The ledgers provide a look at a little-studied social and economic group. They are especially revealing because they were used not only for business entries but also to record family events, including births, deaths, and marriages. As Marco Spallanzani points out in a preface to the book, most scholarship on medieval tradesmen centers on guilds and guild members. The people represented in these ledgers operated outside of economic corporations. They were not a homogeneous group but included a thirteenth-century moneylender, fourteenth-century druggists, cheese sellers, cloth sellers, a tailor, a doublet maker, a grain seller, a secondhand dealer, a broker, a cloth shearer, butchers, wallers, paper makers, and a family of innkeepers who were responsible for seventeen account books. As Marshall notes, the business atmosphere was casual, and this list is a bit deceptive because people s stated occupations were not always how they made their money. One man named as a <b>second-hand</b> <b>dealer</b> in fact used a broker to trade commodities, including 318 pounds of Sardinian cheese, bought one day and sold at a profit the next. ...|$|E

While the literature review suggests using the signaling theory’s framework to study the reduction of perceived risk for a second-hand online purchase, an exploratory qualitative study leads us to consider a new theoretical framework that combines signaling theory with the “laws of sympathetic magic” and thus takes into account the specificities of a second-hand purchase...|$|R

60|$|That the {{portmanteau}} {{was taken}} from his room during his absence with Miss Avondale that afternoon was evident.

If mere booty had been his object, the purse would have satisfied him without his burdening himself with a portmanteau which might be identified. Nothing else in the room had been disturbed. The thief must have had some cognizance of its location, and have kept some espionage over Randolph's movements--a circumstance which added to the mystery and his disquiet. He placed a description of his loss with the police authorities, but their only idea of recovering it was by leaving that description with pawnbrokers and <b>second-hand</b> <b>dealers,</b> a proceeding that Randolph instinctively felt was in vain.|$|R
