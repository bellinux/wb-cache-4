5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% <b>strontium</b> <b>oxide</b> and 10% barium oxide.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{electrode potential}} for the Sr2+/Sr couple is −2.89V, approximately midway between those of the Ca2+/Ca (−2.84V) and Ba2+/Ba (−2.92V) couples, and close {{to those of the}} neighboring alkali metals. Strontium is intermediate between calcium and barium in its reactivity toward water, with which it reacts on contact to produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Strontium metal burns in air to produce both <b>strontium</b> <b>oxide</b> and strontium nitride, but since it does not react with nitrogen below 380°C, at room temperature, it forms only the oxide spontaneously. Besides the simple oxide SrO, the peroxide SrO2 can be made by direct oxidation of strontium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Sr(O2)2. Strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of strontium are known.|$|E

40|$|Oxidation {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} on six different aluminum alloy compositions {{in order to determine}} the effects that silicon, strontium, and magnesium have on the oxidation behavior at temperatures between 700 and 800 °C. This was determined through weight gain studies using a thermogravimetric balance, microscopic examination of sample surfaces and cross-sections, and chemical analysis of the phases formed during oxidation. The addition of 12 % silicon to aluminum promoted the formation of alpha-alumina nodules on the sample surface at 800 °C by reducing the viscosity of the molten metal to allow for better feeding of fresh metal through cracks in the top <b>oxide.</b> <b>Strontium</b> was found to prevent the formation of oxide nodules in an Al- 12 %Si alloy through the formation of a <b>strontium</b> containing <b>oxide.</b> Similarly, in a commercial 356 alloy, strontium greatly reduced the extent of oxidation by preventing the preferential oxidation of magnesium. It is believed that the mechanism responsible for this is also through the formation of a <b>strontium</b> containing <b>oxide.</b> Oxidation experiments conducted on an Al- 3 %Mg alloy revealed that magnesium preferentially oxidizes to form two oxides, firstly MgO, and secondly MgAl 2 O 4, which forms only from the reaction of MgO and aluminum. Weight gains for this alloy were greatly affected by the oxidizing temperature. Higher temperatures shortened the incubation time to breakaway oxidation and decreased the time required to oxidize all the magnesium from the alloy...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{alkaline}} {{alcohol fuel}} cells (DAAFCs) have attracted increasing interest {{over the past}} decade because of their favourable reaction kinetics in alkaline media, higher energy densities achievable and the easy handling of the liquid fuels. In this review, principles and mechanisms of DAAFCs in alcohol oxidation and oxygen reduction are discussed. Despite the high energy densities available during the oxidation of polycarbon alcohols they are difficult to oxidise. Apart from methanol, the complete oxidation of other polycarbon alcohols to CO 2 has not been achieved with current catalysts. Different types of catalysts, from conventional precious metal catalyst of Pt and Pt alloys to other lower cost Pd, Au and Ag metal catalysts are compared. Non precious metal catalysts, and lanthanum, <b>strontium</b> <b>oxides</b> and perovskite-type oxides are also discussed. Membranes like the ones used as polymer electrolytes and developed for DAAFCs are reviewed. Unlike conventional proton exchange membrane fuel cells, anion exchange membranes are used in present DAAFCs. Fuel cell performance with DAAFCs using different alcohols, catalysts and membranes, as well as operating parameters are summarised. In order to improve the power output of the DAAFCs, further developments in catalysts, membrane materials and fuel cell systems are essential...|$|R

The co-precipitate samples were obtained in alkaline pH and had a mixture of the perovskite and pure <b>strontium</b> and zirconium <b>oxide</b> phases. Ester conversion using these samples was approximately 1. 6 %, indicating no catalytic activity.
