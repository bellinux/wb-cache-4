5|$|Unable to {{maneuver}} the Soyuz to dock with the station, Stone ejects herself via explosive decompression {{and uses a}} fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to travel the final metres to Tiangong, which is rapidly deorbiting. Stone then enters the <b>Shenzhou</b> capsule just as Tiangong starts to break up on the upper edge of the atmosphere. Stone radios that she is ready {{to head back to}} Earth. After re-entering the atmosphere, Stone hears Mission Control, which is tracking the capsule and sending a rescue. But due to a harsh reentry and the premature jettison of the heat shield, a fire starts inside the capsule.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, {{authorization}} {{and funding}} was {{given for the}} first phase of Project 921, which was a plan to launch a crewed spacecraft. The <b>Shenzhou</b> program had four uncrewed test flights and two crewed missions. The first one was <b>Shenzhou</b> 1 on November 20, 1999. On January 9, 2001 <b>Shenzhou</b> 2 launched carrying test animals. <b>Shenzhou</b> 3 and <b>Shenzhou</b> 4 were launched in 2002, carrying test dummies. Following these was the successful <b>Shenzhou</b> 5, China's first crewed mission in space on October 15, 2003, which carried Yang Liwei in orbit for 21 hours and made China the third nation to launch a human into orbit. <b>Shenzhou</b> 6 followed two years later ending {{the first phase of}} the Project 921. Missions are launched on the Long March 2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The China Crewed Space Engineering Office provides engineering and administrative support for the crewed <b>Shenzhou</b> missions.|$|E
25|$|The manned <b>Shenzhou</b> 10 spacecraft, {{the final}} <b>Shenzhou</b> mission to {{rendezvous}} with Tiangong-1 before its deorbit, was launched on 11 June 2013. The launch of <b>Shenzhou</b> 10 was originally planned for {{earlier in the}} year, but was delayed to allow the mission to incorporate more complex scientific experiments. The mission's crew included China's second female astronaut, Wang Yaping. <b>Shenzhou</b> 10 docked successfully with Tiangong-1 on 13 June.|$|E
25|$|Tiangong-1 {{was visited}} {{by a series}} of <b>Shenzhou</b> {{spacecraft}} during its two-year operational lifetime. The first of these, the unmanned <b>Shenzhou</b> 8, successfully docked with the module in November 2011, while the manned <b>Shenzhou</b> 9 mission docked in June 2012. A third and final mission to Tiangong-1, the manned <b>Shenzhou</b> 10, docked in June 2013. The manned missions to Tiangong-1 were notable for including China's first female astronauts, Liu Yang and Wang Yaping.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, it was {{reported}} that China had finished the initial crew selection for the <b>Shenzhou</b> 9 mission. Niu Hongguang, the deputy chief commander of the China Manned Space Engineering Project, stated that <b>Shenzhou</b> 9 would dock with Tiangong-1 before August 2012. The <b>Shenzhou</b> 9 spacecraft was delivered to Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center for launch preparations on 9 April 2012, while its Long March 2F carrier rocket arrived a month later on 9 May.|$|E
25|$|The {{unmanned}} <b>Shenzhou</b> 8 mission successfully docked with Tiangong-1 on 2 November 2011 GMT, marking China's first orbital docking. <b>Shenzhou</b> 8 undocked from Tiangong-1 on 14 November, before successfully {{completing a}} second rendezvous and docking, thus testing the reusability of the docking system. <b>Shenzhou</b> 8 deorbited on 17 November 2011, and landed intact in Siziwang Banner in Inner Mongolia. After the mission, the CNSA reported that Tiangong-1's systems were in optimal condition.|$|E
25|$|On 15 June 2013, the <b>Shenzhou</b> 10 crew {{completed}} China's first orbital maintenance operation, replacing Tiangong-1's interior cladding. Additional {{maintenance work}} {{was conducted on}} the space station's seal rings. On 20 June, Wang Yaping delivered a remote video lecture from orbit to students across China, demonstrating physics in microgravity with her colleagues. On 24 June, CPC General Secretary Xi Jinping contacted the astronauts via remote video link to congratulate them. After a series of successful docking tests, <b>Shenzhou</b> 10 undocked and returned safely to Earth on 26 June 2013. With a duration of 15 days, <b>Shenzhou</b> 10 was China's longest manned space mission, until <b>Shenzhou</b> 11's 30 day mission to Tiangong-2 in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The first docking {{was entirely}} computer-controlled, without {{input from the}} three astronauts; a second, crew-guided docking was {{successfully}} conducted on 24 June 2012 at 12:42 Beijing time. <b>Shenzhou</b> 9 landed safely in Inner Mongolia on 29 June 2012. In August 2012, <b>Shenzhou</b> 9's crew travelled to Hong Kong to discuss their mission with university students.|$|E
25|$|On the 50th {{anniversary of}} the PRC's founding, China {{launched}} the <b>Shenzhou</b> 1 spacecraft on November 20, 1999 and recovered it after a flight of 21 hours. The country became the third country with a successful crewed space program by sending an astronaut into space aboard <b>Shenzhou</b> 5 on October 15, 2003 for more than 21 hours.|$|E
25|$|China's <b>Shenzhou</b> 10 manned {{spacecraft}} returns safely to Earth, having conducted China's longest manned space mission to date.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>Shenzhou</b> 10 mission, Chinese astronauts {{deliver the}} country's first public video {{broadcast}} from the orbiting Tiangong-1 space laboratory.|$|E
25|$|The {{second phase}} of the Project 921 started with <b>Shenzhou</b> 7, China's first spacewalk mission. Then, two crewed {{missions}} were planned to the first Chinese space laboratory. The PRC initially designed the <b>Shenzhou</b> spacecraft with docking technologies imported from Russia, therefore compatible with the International Space Station (ISS). On September 29, 2011, China launched Tiangong 1. This target module is intended to be the first step to testing the technology required for a planned space station.|$|E
25|$|This {{could also}} be the {{beginning}} of China's crewed international cooperation, the existence of which was officially disclosed for the first time after the launch of <b>Shenzhou</b> 7.|$|E
25|$|Li began two megaprojects {{when he was}} the Premier. He {{initiated}} the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on 14 December 1994, and later began preparations for the <b>Shenzhou</b> Manned Space Program. Both programs were subject to much controversy within China and abroad. The <b>Shenzhou</b> program was especially criticized due to its extraordinary cost (tens of billions of dollars) in a country that sometimes referred to itself as a Third World nation. Many economists and humanitarians suggested that those billions in capital might be better invested in helping the Chinese population deal with economic hardships and improvement in the China's education, health services, and legal system.|$|E
25|$|Tiangong-1's {{experimental}} module {{is equipped}} with exercise gear and two sleep stations. The interior walls of the spacecraft have a two-color paint scheme – one color representative of the ground, and the other representative of the sky. This is intended to help the astronauts maintain their orientation in zero gravity. High-resolution interior cameras allow manned missions to be closely monitored from the ground, and the two sleep stations have individual lighting controls. Toilet facilities and cooking equipment for the manned missions are provided by the docked <b>Shenzhou</b> spacecraft, rather than being integrated into the Tiangong module itself. Similarly, {{one member of the}} module's three-person crew sleeps in the <b>Shenzhou</b> spacecraft, preventing overcrowding.|$|E
25|$|Data relay {{satellite}} (数据中继卫星) Tianlian I (天链一号), specially {{developed to}} decrease the communication time between the <b>Shenzhou</b> 7 spaceship and the ground; it will also improve the amount of data that can be transferred. The current orbit coverage of 12 percent will thus be increased {{to a total of}} about 60 percent.|$|E
25|$|China's {{advanced}} {{technology is the}} result of the integration of various related technological experiences. Early Chinese satellites, such as the FSW series, have undergone many atmospheric reentry tests. In the 1990s China had commercial launches, resulting in more launch experiences and a high success rate after the 1990s. China has aimed to undertake scientific development in fields like Solar System exploration. China's <b>Shenzhou</b> 7 spacecraft successfully performed an EVA in September 2008. China's <b>Shenzhou</b> 9 spacecraft successfully performed a manned docking in June 2012. Furthermore, China's Chang'e 2 explorer became the first object to reach Sun-Earth Lagrangian point in August 2011 and also the first probe to explore both Moon and asteroid by making a flyby of the asteroid 4179 Toutatis. China has launched DAMPE, the most capable dark matter explorer to date in 2015, and world's first quantum communication satellite QUESS in 2016.|$|E

25|$|<b>Shenzhou</b> 9 {{launched}} successfully on 16 June 2012, carrying with it China's {{first female}} astronaut, Liu Yang. The spacecraft docked with Tiangong-1 on 18 June 2012 at 14:07 Beijing time (06:07 GMT; 07:07 BST). After about three hours, {{when the air}} pressures inside the two vessels were equalized, mission commander Jing Haipeng entered Tiangong-1.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{government}} {{launched its}} manned space program in 1992, reportedly with {{some help from}} Russia due to their extended history in space. Qian's research {{was used as the}} basis for the Long March rocket, which successfully launched the <b>Shenzhou</b> V mission in October 2003. The elderly Qian was able to watch China's first manned space mission on television from his hospital bed.|$|E
25|$|Behind the scenes, China's {{media was}} ordered to tone down {{coverage}} of the unfolding scandal to prevent unrest. News editors were ordered {{to adhere to the}} official copy of Xinhua. Traditionally, media knows to avoid negative news coverage, and CCTV shifted reporting emphasis on the forthcoming launch of <b>Shenzhou</b> VII. The announcement of the AQSIQ test results was relegated to the final item on the CCTV evening news.|$|E
25|$|The {{first human}} spaceflight was Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961, on which {{cosmonaut}} Yuri Gagarin of the USSR made one {{orbit around the}} Earth. In official Soviet documents, {{there is no mention}} of the fact that Gagarin parachuted the final seven miles. Currently, the only spacecraft regularly used for human spaceflight are the Russian Soyuz spacecraft and the Chinese <b>Shenzhou</b> spacecraft. The U.S. Space Shuttle fleet operated from April 1981 until July 2011. SpaceShipOne has conducted two human suborbital spaceflights.|$|E
500|$|This {{arrangement}} of allowing competitive industry to flourish {{in some regions}} while setting up its opposite of strict government-regulated and monopolized production and trade in others was not exclusive to iron manufacturing. In {{the beginning of the}} Song, the government supported competitive silk mills and brocade workshops in the eastern provinces and in the capital city of Kaifeng. However, {{at the same time the}} government established strict legal prohibition on the merchant trade of privately produced silk in Sichuan province. This prohibition dealt an economic blow to Sichuan that caused a small rebellion (which was subdued), yet Song Sichuan was well known for its independent industries producing timber and cultivated oranges. [...] The reforms of the Chancellor Wang Anshi (10211086) sparked heated debate amongst ministers of court when he nationalised the industries manufacturing, processing, and distributing tea, salt, and wine. [...] The state monopoly on Sichuan tea was the prime source of revenue for the state's purchase of horses in Qinghai for the Song army's cavalry forces. Wang's restrictions on the private manufacture and trade of salt were even criticized in a famous poem by Su Shi, and while the opposing politically charged faction at court gained advantage and lost favor, Wang Anshi's reforms were continually abandoned and reinstated. Despite this political quarrel, the Song Empire's main source of revenue continued to come from state-managed monopolies and indirect taxes. As for private entrepreneurship, great profits could still be pursued by the merchants in the luxury item trades and specialized regional production. For example, the silk producers of Raoyang County, <b>Shenzhou</b> Prefecture, southern Hebei province were especially known for producing silken headwear for the Song emperor and high court officials in the capital.|$|E
