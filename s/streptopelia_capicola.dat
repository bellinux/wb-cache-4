50|$|The {{ring-necked dove}} (<b>Streptopelia</b> <b>capicola),</b> {{also known as}} the Cape turtle dove or half-collared dove, is a {{widespread}} and often abundant dove species in East and southern Africa. It is a mostly sedentary bird, found in a catholic variety of open habitats. Within range, its penetrating and rhythmic, three-syllabled crooning is a familiar sound at any time of the year. Its name is derived from the semi-collar of black feathers on the lower nape, a feature shared with a number of Streptopelia species. Like all doves they depend on surface water. They congregate in large flocks at waterholes in dry regions to drink and bathe.|$|E
40|$|In 2011 - 2012, {{the line}} {{transect}} method {{was employed to}} study avian assemblages in the Koakoland (Mopane) Savanna around the Ruacana waterfall in the Kunene Region, north-western Namibia. In total 64 resident species were recorded, a number which was high in comparison with other bushy habitats. Simpson’s Diversity Index was also high (S = 0. 96). Group of dominant species (32. 4 %) comprised <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>capicola,</b> Tockus erythrorhynchus, Plocepasser mahali, Pycnonotis nigricans and Lanioturdus torquatus. The following species recorded as resident around Ruacana Waterfall were endemic to Namibia: Poicephalus rueppellii, Phoeniculus damarensis, Lanioturdus torquatus, Tockus damarensis and Parus carpi. Although {{the difference between the}} riparian and dry variety of the Mopane Savanna was insignificant in terms of biodiversity (S = 0. 97 and S = 0. 92 respectively), the number of species in dry bush was much lower than in the riparian bush (χ 2 -test = 4. 76; p < 0. 05). Also the Sörensen similarity coefficient was unexpectedly low between the two habitat varieties (I = 0. 48) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{core area}} of {{speciation}} research concerns the coevolution of species-specific signals and the selective sensitivity to such signals. Signals {{and responses to}} them should be tuned to each other, {{to be effective in}} intraspecific communication. Hybrid zones are ideal to study the presence of such ‘behavioural coupling’ and the mechanisms governing it, and this has rarely been done. Our study examines acoustic signals of males and their response to them in the context of territorial interactions in a natural hybrid zone between two dove species, Streptopelia vinacea and <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>capicola.</b> Male signals are important in hybrid zone dynamics as they are essential for territory establishment, which is crucial for successful reproduction. We tested whether the response of individual male hybrids is linked to how similar their own signal is to the playback signal. We did not find evidence for behavioural coupling. The combined evidence from the low level of response to hybrid and heterospecific signals outside the hybrid zone and a lack of coupling within the hybrid zone suggests that perceptual learning may explain our results. Learning to respond to locally abundant signals may be the best individual strategy and is likely to contribute to the maintenance of a hybrid zone...|$|E
40|$|Linear {{measurements}} and derived indices from striated trypanosomas in nine species of sub-Saharan birds representing seven {{families of the}} Passeriformes, were compared. The dimensions of the striated trypomastigotes from the Carduelinae, Estrildidae, Nectarinidae, Passeridae, Pycnonotidae, Turdinae and Zosteropidae were similar {{to each other as}} well as to those of the striated trypanosomes from the boreal owl (Strigidae). All these trypanosomes were considered to be Trypanosoma avium Danilewsky, 1885. A further 20 avian species were considered to harbour T. avium, thus greatly extending the reported host range of this trypanosome. Non-striated trypanosomes from the estrildid Uraeginthus angolensis closely resembled Trypanosoma bouffardi Leger & Blanchard, 1911 in appearance and dimensions, and were considered to be of this species. Additional host records for T. bouffardi from an additional nine avian species have been reported. The uniquely small and stumpy Trypanosoma everetti Molyneux, 1973 was reported from an additional 18 avian species. A large non-striated trypanosome from the laughing dove, Streptopelia senegalensis, was identified as Trypanosoma hannae Pittaluga, 1905 and this species was re-described. An infection of this parasite was also found in a single <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>capicola</b> and a single Streptopelia semitorquata. Two trypanosomes seen in the francolin, Francolinus natalensis, were identified as Trypanosoma calmettei Mathis & Leger, 1909...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBiological control {{programmes}} have been mounted against all invasive Australian acacias with two agent species, Melanterius servulus (seed feeding weevil), and Dasineura dielsi (flower galling midge), being released on Acacia cyclops (rooikrans) in 1991 and 2002 respectively. Both of these agents are prolific and are causing {{high levels of}} damage, resulting in reduced seeding capacity of A. cyclops {{which in turn is}} expected to limit the invasiveness of the species. As part of an ongoing study to determine the long-term effectiveness of the biological control programme, we measured seed removal rates of A. cyclops by invertebrates and vertebrates, and the composition of granivorous species, to determine how these compare with earlier studies when there was no biological control. Results show that in A. cyclops thickets under biological control, 13 % of seeds were removed by invertebrates 59 % by rodents and 15 % by ground-foraging birds and large mammals within 24 h. The removal rates of seeds with arils intact were double than those of seeds without arils. Camera traps captured 10 vertebrate species comprising six birds and four mammals including Mellivora capensis Storr (Cape ratel) and Raphicerus melanotis Thunberg (Cape grysbok) consuming seeds from stashes. The most frequent visitors were Rhabdomys pumilio (striped mouse), <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>capicola</b> (Cape turtledove) and Cossypha caffra (Cape robin-chat) (33 %, 27 % and 20 % of visits respectively). We conclude that levels of granivory and the composition have not changed substantially with biological agents in the system...|$|E
40|$|Secondary {{contact between}} {{closely related species}} can lead to hybridization. The fitness of hybrid {{individuals}} {{within and outside the}} hybrid zone determines whether the hybrid zone expands into the ranges of the 2 parental species or remains a stable, geographically narrow area in between the allopatric ranges of the parental species. In birds, vocalizations {{play an important role in}} male [...] male competition and female mate choice and are often affected by hybridization. One of the factors that will influence male hybrid fitness is the ability to defend a territory against competitors by vocalizing. We tested the efficacy of territorial signals of hybrids of 2 dove species, Streptopelia vinacea and <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>capicola,</b> compared with the vocalizations of the parental species. With playback experiments, we assessed the response to hybrid and the 2 parental species vocalizations in the hybrid zone and adjacent allopatric populations of each species. In the hybrid zone, males did not respond differently to the 3 vocalization types. In both allopatric populations, however, males responded more to conspecific than to heterospecific signals and the response strength to hybrid signals was intermediate. Therefore, in the allopatric populations, hybrid males may have a reduced success in defending territories. In male [...] male interactions in the hybrid zone, hybrids may not have a disadvantage compared with males of the parental species. The ability to defend a territory against competitors may thus help maintain a stable hybrid zone in the area of overlap. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|Birds show phylogenetic {{variation}} in {{the relative importance of}} respiratory versus cutaneous evaporation, but the consequences for heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity remain unclear. We measured evaporative water loss (EWL), resting metabolic rate (RMR) and body temperature (Tb) in four arid-zone columbids from southern Africa [Namaqua dove (Oena capensis, ∼ 37  g), laughing dove (Spilopelia senegalensis, ∼ 89  g) and Cape turtle dove (<b>Streptopelia</b> <b>capicola,</b> ∼ 148  g) ] and Australia [crested pigeon (Ocyphaps lophotes), ∼ 186  g] at air temperatures (Ta) of up to 62 °C. There was no clear relationship between body mass and maximum Ta tolerated during acute heat exposure. Maximum Tb at very high Ta was 43. 1 ± 1. 0, 43. 7 ± 0. 8, 44. 7 ± 0. 3 and 44. 3 ± 0. 8 °C in Namaqua doves, laughing doves, Cape turtle doves and crested pigeons, respectively. In all four species, RMR increased significantly at Ta above thermoneutrality, but the increases were relatively modest with RMR at Ta= 56 °C being 32, 60, 99 and 11 % higher, respectively, than at Ta= 35 °C. At the highest Ta values reached, evaporative heat loss was equivalent to 466, 227, 230 and 275 % of metabolic heat production. The maximum ratio of evaporative heat loss to metabolic production observed in Namaqua doves, 4. 66, exceeds by a substantial margin previous values reported for birds. Our results support the notion that cutaneous evaporation provides a highly efficient mechanism of heat dissipation and an enhanced ability to tolerate extremely high Ta.

40|$|Temperature and {{rainfall}} {{related to}} altitudinal gradients influence ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms to physical factors. In this study, the line transect method was {{used during the}} years 1996 – 2001 to compare resident (potentially breeding) bird communities in three altitudinal divisions in Highveld/Drakensberg grasslands in Lesotho: lowlands (2200 m a. s. l.). In total, 105 resident species were recorded. The total number of species recorded in lowlands was higher than that in highlands and foothills, but this difference was not statistically significant. The highland and foothill {{did not differ in}} numbers of species. A group of five species dominated at all three sites, and the proportion of dominant species in relation to the whole assemblage was very similar. The composition of the dominant group (species with more than 5 % of pairs) and the group of species most often encountered (in more than 80 % of transects) was, however, different. Only two species, Cape Canary Serinuscanicollis and Karoo Prinia Priniamaculosa were dominant in all three study areas, and just one species, the Cape Bunting Emberizacapensis, was dominant in two plots. Similarly, only two species, the Cape Turtle-Dove <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>capicola</b> and Cape Canary had a high frequency of occurrence in all three study areas, and two otherspecies, theKaroo Prinia and Cape Bunting — in two study areas. Simpson’s Diversity Index was strikingly the same (S = 0. 96) for all three avian assemblages (lowland, foothill and highland) investigated. However, proportions of breeding pairs of some congeneric species were found to change with the altitude. The granivores were more common (44 – 45 %) in the foothills and highlands than in lowlands (36 %), while insectivores were more common in the highlands (50 %) than in foothills and lowlands (36 – 37 %). In general, avifauna is relatively diverse and unique in the Highveld/Drakensberg grasslands. Results presented here provide data for further investigation of the effect of the supposed climate warming on the diversity and structure of avian communities...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesClimate change poses a {{major threat}} to living organisms, with maximum {{temperatures}} expected to continue to rise over the next few decades. Hot desert environments are particularly at risk because they experience high environmental temperatures, scarce vegetation, low productivity and unpredictable water sources. Endotherms such as birds face the challenge of maintaining a stable body temperature while avoiding dehydration. This study was carried out in the southern Kalahari, in South Africa's Northern Cape, where about 50 % of bird species (36 species) depend on free-standing drinking water. Livestock farms within this area provide artificial water points, which benefit birds as well as livestock. This study determined the role of shade and cover in the use of these artificial water points by birds. An experiment was conducted at six waterholes using the Before-After, Control-Impact (BACI) design. After an initial baseline was established, three waterholes were shaded while the other three were left unshaded. Camera traps were used to record the pattern and intensity of water use by bird species at different times of the day and at varying air temperatures. A total of 36 bird species drank at the water holes, but data analysis was confined to the ten most abundant species. Of the ten, six species responded to the presence of shade/cover, with four species reacting positively (Cape Glossy Starling Lamprotornis nitens, Red - headed Finch Amadina erythrocephala, Black - throated Canary Serinus atrogularis, and Laughing Dove Spilopelia senegalensis), four showing no significant change in drinking patterns, and two showing a decrease in visitor numbers when the site was shaded (Cape Turtle - Dove <b>Streptopelia</b> <b>capicola,</b> Namaqua Dove Oena capensis). This suggests that providing shade at waterholes is not a universal {{solution to the problem of}} increasing heat stress experienced by birds coming to drink. Certain species such as the Laughing Doves and Cape Turtle-Doves avoided waterholes during the warmest time of the day while the Namaqua Doves were frequent visitors at this time. However, the Laughing Dove took advantage of the shade provided at midday (warmest temperatures) as their numbers increased. The Red-headed Finch and Black-throated Canary also increased at water holes with temperature irrespective of the time of day. These patterns imply that the provision of shade modifies the behavior of some bird species in response to predation risk or heat stress. These species utilized shade at different times of day and with varying intensities as temperatures rose...|$|E
