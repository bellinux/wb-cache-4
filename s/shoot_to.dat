The title was later confirmed as <b>Shoot</b> <b>to</b> Kill with a release date of 6 November 2014, and it was further confirmed that Cole would be credited as Steve Cole for the release.|$|E
5|$|In films, the gunslinger often {{possesses}} a nearly superhuman speed and skill with the revolver. Twirling pistols, lightning draws, and trick shots are standard fare for the gunmen {{of the big}} screen. In the real world, however, gunmen who relied on flashy tricks and theatrics died quickly, and most gunslingers took a much more practical approach to their weapons. Real gunslingers did not <b>shoot</b> <b>to</b> disarm or to impress, but to kill.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Anbe Sivam commenced in July 2002. The {{first scene}} featuring the lead actors {{was shot at}} Pollachi Junction railway station. Kamal and Madhavan interacted closely during {{the initial stages of}} the <b>shoot</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the on-screen chemistry between the pair was apparent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shooting</b> <b>to</b> wound {{refers to}} {{attempts}} {{to use a}} firearm to harm someone without killing them. It is controversial, since the unpredictable nature of firearm wounds {{could result in the}} wound failing to incapacitate, accidentally killing or missing the target, the latter presenting a risk of unintended casualties. Limbs are one main area often targeted when <b>shooting</b> <b>to</b> wound, however limbs can be moved faster and more radically than the torso, and so the option of <b>shooting</b> <b>to</b> wound is generally viewed with skepticism by law enforcement.|$|R

5|$|Three {{attempts}} to sabotage the ship {{were discovered in}} 1904. On 31 March, rivets on the keel plates were found bored through. On 14 September, a 1⅜in (3.5cm) bolt was found driven into the launching way, where it protruded some 5in (11cm). Shortly after the Connecticut was launched on 29 September, a hole 1in (2.5cm) in diameter was discovered drilled through a ⅝in (1.6cm) steel keel plate. The ship's watertight compartments and pumps prevented her from sinking, and all damage was repaired. The incidents prompted the Navy to post armed guards at the shipyard, and an overnight watch was kept by a Navy tug manned by Marines who had orders to <b>shoot</b> <b>to</b> kill any unauthorized person attempting to approach the ship.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on 28 November 2013 at Hyderabad. Tamannaah {{joined the}} film's sets on 12 December 2013. A village set resembling Tadipatri was erected in Gujarat for the film's <b>shoot</b> <b>to</b> avoid local interference from crowds that would ensue if shot in Andhra Pradesh, where Mahesh is a star. Few key scenes including a fight sequence were shot at Nanakramguda {{in a large}} set. The next schedule stated at Bellary from 23 February 2014. Mahesh did not suffer any injuries during the film's shoot at Bellary, but took rest due to the stress he underwent. Filming continued at Hyderabad from 10 March 2014. Some comedy scenes were filmed on the principal cast. Few scenes were filmed at the Mount Opera in Hyderabad. Scenes featuring Mahesh, Prasad and Sood were filmed in early April 2014.|$|E
5|$|The scenes set in Egypt were {{filmed in}} Tunisia, and the canyon where Indiana threatens {{to blow up}} the Ark was shot in Sidi Bouhlel, just outside Tozeur. The canyon {{location}} had been used for the Tatooine scenes from 1977's Star Wars (many of the location crew members were the same for both films) where R2-D2 was attacked by Jawas. The Tanis scenes were filmed in nearby Sedala, a harsh place due to heat and disease. Several cast and crew members fell ill and Rhys-Davies defecated in his costume during one shot. Spielberg averted disease by eating only canned foods from England, but did not like the area and quickly condensed the scheduled six-week <b>shoot</b> <b>to</b> four-and-a-half weeks. Much was improvised: the scene where Marion puts on her dress and attempts to leave Belloq's tent was improvised as was the entire plane fight. During that scene's shooting, a wheel went over Ford's knee and tore his left leg's cruciate ligament, but he refused local medical help and simply put ice on it.|$|E

5|$|Glasgow based {{animation}} studio, Axis Animation, assisted 343 Industries on {{the creation}} of CGI cinematics for the Spartan Ops game mode. Axis have produced animations for numerous video games, including the award-winning announcement trailer for Dead Island. To make each Spartan Ops episode as engaging as possible the team at Axis shot and edited episodes in live action using performance capture. The team then used the reference cameras at the live action <b>shoot</b> <b>to</b> create a performance edit, before shooting with CG cameras to provide more coverage of all scenes and a greater selection of shots for the editorial team. The shading team at Axis made use of the 3D animation package, Houdini, to procedurally generate the environment in the cinematics. Axis worked with Glasgow-based audio post production company Savalas on sound design and the final mix for the Spartan Ops cinematics. Facial motion capture was also utilized to take the movements and facial expressions from actors and apply them to the in-game cinematics for both Spartan Ops and campaign. Performance capture for both campaign and Spartan Ops cutscenes was directed and recorded at Giant Studios. Axis worked in conjunction with Giant Studios and Cubic Motion to develop a special facial motion capture solution that would retain facial expressions from the actors when creating the animation.|$|E

January 2006 saw Elie Wiesel's Night selected; Winfrey even traveled to Auschwitz with Wiesel. In 2008, Eckhart Tolle's A New Earth was selected.
