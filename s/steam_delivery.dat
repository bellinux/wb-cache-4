5000|$|The PRR {{began to}} develop steam {{locomotives}} again in the mid-to-late 1930s, but with a difference. Where previous PRR locomotive policy had been conservative, new radical designs took hold. Designers from the Baldwin Locomotive Works, the PRR's longtime development partner, were eager to prove the viability of steam {{in the face of}} new competition from Diesel-electric locomotives, and persuaded the railroad to adopt Baldwin's latest idea: the duplex locomotive. This split the locomotive's driving wheels into two sets, each with its own pair of cylinders and rods. Previously, the only locomotives with two sets of drivers were articulated locomotives, but the duplex used one rigid frame. In a duplex design, cylinders could be smaller and the weight of side and main rods could be drastically reduced. Given that the movement of the main rod could not be fully balanced, the duplex design would reduce [...] "hammer blow" [...] on the track. The lower reciprocating mass meant that higher speeds could be achieved. Use of poppet valves also increased the speed because they gave very accurately-timed <b>steam</b> <b>delivery</b> to the cylinders. However, there was a drawback of the metallurgy used; the poppet valve could not take the stress of sustained high speed operation (meaning over 100 mi/h km/h on production T1s).|$|E
40|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>delivery</b> {{networks}} are large energy consuming processes {{and an important}} source of energy in many processing plants. These {{networks are}} often subject to large disturbances, which can lead to costly operating periods due to lack of steam and heavily loaded boilers. Thus, there is a potential for stabilization and reduction of the energy consumption. The objective of this thesis is to stabilize a <b>steam</b> <b>delivery</b> network using a model predictive controller, and further minimize the energy consumption by incorporating an overlying optimization problem, that is an optimizer, on top of the model predictive controller. The controller and the optimizer developed in this thesis are applied to the <b>steam</b> <b>delivery</b> network at Statoil K&# 229;rst&# 248;, but the principles are applicable for any <b>steam</b> <b>delivery</b> network. A study of the <b>steam</b> <b>delivery</b> networks including its main components and control structure are performed. The study is based on real plant data and a dynamic simulator model. The network consists of eight boilers, in which all deliver high pressure steam into a common header. Steam is continuously drawn from the common header by various steam consumers before it is returned to the boilers as condensate. This behavior makes it easy to obtain step response models of the boilers by performing a step in their inputs, that is increase their combustion. These models are incorporated into the controller which is implemented using the SEPTIC application developed by Statoil. This controller optimizes the future response by solving a quadratic optimization problem, consisting of various weights and constraints on the considered variables in combination with the models of the system, at each control sample. The ideal values of this controller is calculated the optimizer, derived from the mass and energy balances of the <b>steam</b> <b>delivery</b> network. Two different optimizers are derived and considered, one which does not allow for a boiler shutdown, and the second which allows for a boiler shutdown. These are named conservative and strictly economical optimization, respectively. Three different case studies, with increasingly degrees of disturbances, are carried out to study the performance of the model predictive controller compared to the currently used PI control structure. Five additional case studies are performed to illustrate the potential and issues occurring by incorporating an optimizer. The results show improved performance and stability by including a model predictive controller and indicate a significant potential for reduction in both fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions by incorporating an optimizer. However, only the conservative optimizer proved to be robust against model errors and large disturbances. </p...|$|E

It helps to check the disadvantage of using seed scorchers which produces burnt or unevenly heated seeds which results in black oil formation. The equipment consists of an insulated heating unit, roaster, seed inlet unit, seed discharge outlet, power transmission unit and the frame work. A gear motor of 0. 25 kW was selected to supply power to the shaft whose end was welded to the stirrer. The roasting unit consists of three compartments: roasting chamber, steam chamber and insulator chamber. The insulated heating unit has two pipes: water inlet pipe and <b>steam</b> <b>delivery</b> pipe. Also, two electric heating elements of 2. 75 kW each were installed in the heating unit to help boil the water for steam to form; this steam will then be transported by the <b>steam</b> <b>delivery</b> pipe to the steam chamber which in turn heats up the outer surface of the roasting chamber and thus the seeds inside are roasted through the heat being supplied.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} on the GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions of the raw material supply chain, the utilisation of excess heat and CO 2 storage for a bio-SNG (biomass gasification-based synthetic natural gas) system by applying a consequential life cycle assessment approach. The impact of the biomass supply chain is analysed by assessing GHG emissions of locally produced woodchips and pellets with regional or transatlantic origin. Results show that the supply area for the gasification plant can be substantially increased with only modest increases in overall GHG emissions (3 - 5 %) by using regionally produced pellets. The transatlantic pellet chains contribute to significantly higher GHG emissions. Utilising excess heat for power generation or <b>steam</b> <b>delivery</b> for industrial use contributes to lower emissions from the system, whereas delivery of district heating can contribute to either increased or decreased emissions. The production technology of the replaced heat and the carbon intensity of the reference power production were decisive for the benefits of the heat deliveries. Finally, the storage of CO 2 separated from the syngas upgrading and from the flue gases of the gasifier can nearly double the GHG emission reduction potential of the bio-SNG system.

40|$|Nuclear Renewable Oil Shale Systems (NROSS) are a {{class of}} large Hybrid Energy Systems in which nuclear {{reactors}} provide the primary energy used to produce shale oil from kerogen deposits and also provide flexible, dispatchable electricity to the grid. Kerogen is solid organic matter trapped in sedimentary shale, and the formations of kerogen oil shale in the western United States are the largest and densest hydrocarbon resource on the planet. When heated above 300 °C, kerogen decomposes into oil, gas, and char. NROSS couples electricity and transportation fuel production in a single operation, reduces lifecycle carbon emissions from the fuel produced, improves economics for the nuclear plant, and enables a major shift toward a very-low-carbon electricity grid. The nuclear reactor driving an NROSS system would operate steadily at full power, providing steam for shale heating in closed steam lines {{when the price of}} electricity is low and electricity to the grid when the price of electricity is high. Because oil shale has low thermal conductivity, heat input to the shale can be cycled as needed without disrupting the steady increase in average temperature. The target average shale temperature of 350 °C would be reached over 2 years using two heating stages in the baseline configuration driven by light water reactors. First stage heating brings the shale to an intermediate temperature, assumed to be 210 °C in this study. The second heating stage isolates the <b>steam</b> <b>delivery</b> line from the reactor and uses electricity, purchased when prices are low, to increase steam temperature and bring the shale to 350 °C. This capacity to absorb low price electricity mitigates the tendency for electricity prices to collapse to zero, or potentially negative values, during periods of peak wind and solar output. The analysis herein shows that liquid fuels produced by a baseline NROSS would have the lowest life cycle greenhouse gas impact of any presently available fossil liquid fuels and that operation as part of an NROSS complex would increase reactor revenues by 41 % over a stand-alone baseload reactor. The flexible, dispatchable electricity provided by NROSS could also enable the transition to a very-low-carbon grid in which renewables are widely deployed and the NROSS provides variable output to balance their uncontrolled output to meet demand. Fully deployed, NROSS could require tens or hundreds of reactors. Large fleet operations and local mass production of the necessary hardware could bring about substantial reductions in system cost as development proceeds, potentially offering a pathway to jump start and maximize the realization of the mass production cost savings envisioned for small modular reactors. The development pathway to achieve large scale NROSS deployment will be complicated, however, requiring involvement from many government agencies, a demonstration system, and a complex commercialization effort with partnered nuclear vendors, utilities, and petroleum system developers. by Daniel Joseph Curtis.
