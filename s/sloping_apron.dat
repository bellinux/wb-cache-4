40|$|Sod tables {{throughout}} the White River Badlands are vestigial remnants of pediments, {{which have been}} subsequently dissected by streams. The pediments formed as detritus from the eroding highlands washed and tumbled upon the bedrock remnants, forming a <b>sloping</b> <b>apron</b> along the base of cliffs. As a result, sod tables have planar, gently dipping, turf covered surfaces that stand a part to many meters above the surrounding washes, with their greenery contrasting vividly against surrounding bedrock. The stratigraphy of colluvial/alluvial silts within the sod tables often contains one to six paleosols. We have studied these exposures at localities on the upper prairie, Badlands National Park. Radiocarbon ages of the paleosols reveal that intervals of soil formation occurred at approximately ca. 3600, 2400, 1800, 1200, and 900 RCYBP, several of which have also been reported by other investigators for ages of paleosols within proximal eolian deposits. We take the uppermost paleosol (youngest age) to be the oldest date for the onset of incision that dissected the pediments into sod tables. This constraint exists because for a soil on a pediment to become a paleosol by burial under subsequent alluvium, the pediment surface must remain connected to the bluff. The incision that forms a sod table separates the sod table from the retreating cliff, precluding further alluvial burial of its surface. The timing of this incision is provocative. In addition to disclosing rapid vertical incision of 2 - 4 cm and lateral retreat of 1 - 2 cm annually, we now suspect that the causality of incision is the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA). A growing body of literature is linking various proxy records, including dune activation and lake sediments within the Great Plains, to the MCA. We intend to test our proposed linkage of the incision to the droughts associated with the MCA, and hope to further constrain its timing, by dating the uppermost paleosol at localities along a regional transect...|$|E
40|$|Dams and weirs {{have altered}} river {{conditions}} {{and contributed to}} declines in freshwater fish populations. One factor responsible for this is exposure to extreme hydraulic conditions as they pass downstream. These conditions create stressors including mechanical strike, shear forces, and rapid decompression. Currently, {{focus has been on}} reducing stressors at large hydropower facilities, but there is an increasing need to expand this focus to low head hydropower and weirs. This research investigated hydraulic stressors fish encounter when migrating downstream past low head dams and weirs, further examined how operations of a sluice gate may improve fish welfare, developed decompression dose-response relationships for a selection of fish species, and predicted rates of injury/mortality for four species of fish at four dams/weirs. Autonomous sensors were deployed to quantify hydraulic stressors at a selection of low head dams and weirs where strike, shear, and rapid decompression were recorded. A sluice gate was constructed and installed into a 90 cm laboratory flume and examined using sensors under various gate openings and flow rates, which determined that increasing the gate opening can reduce the occurrence and magnitude of strike. Fish were exposed in the laboratory to rapid decompression to develop predictive models for injury and mortality in four fish species. Decompression testing also revealed that swimming activity alters barotrauma susceptibility in fish. Additionally, Sensor Fish and decompression results were then used to model fish injury and mortality when passing the dams and weirs. The model suggested that injury could occur in as many as 96 % and mortality in as many as 60 % of passing fish. However, injury and mortality varied between structures and species. This research advances our understanding of how low head dams and weirs affect downstream migrating fish and provides recommendations for design and operation of low head facilities. It was concluded that sluice gates should be designed with a submerged <b>sloping</b> <b>apron</b> and operated at the greatest opening possible; plunge pools need to be sufficiently deep for sharp crested gates; and barotrauma may be reduced in fish passing turbines by adjusting the intake to take water from the surface...|$|E
40|$|The Northwest African <b>slope</b> <b>apron</b> is an {{interesting}} modern analogue for deep-water systems with complex seafloor topography. A sediment process map of the Northwest African continental margin illustrates the relative roles of different sedimentary processes acting across the entire margin. Fine-grained pelagic and hemipelagic sedimentation is dominant across a large area of the margin, and is considered to result from background sedimentary processes. Alongslope bottom currents smooth and mould the seafloor sediments, and produce bedforms such as erosional furrows, sediment waves and contourite drifts. Downslope gravity flows (debris avalanches, debris flows and turbidity currents) are infrequent but important events on the margin, and are the dominant processes shaping the morphology of the slope and rise. The overall distribution of sedimentary facies and morphological elements on the Northwest African margin is characteristic of a fine-grained clastic <b>slope</b> <b>apron.</b> However, the presence of numerous volcanic islands and seamounts along the margin leads to a more complex distribution of sedimentary facies than is accounted for by <b>slope</b> <b>apron</b> models.

Geological mapping coupled with detailed biostratigraphy enable the depositional influence of sea-floor topography, an active Llyn Brianne Fault and eustatic sea-level changes to be tracked. The latter may represent ?far field? effects relating to the retreat and advance of contemporary Gondwanan ice sheets. <b>Slope</b> <b>apron</b> mudstone facies reveal a strong response to high order eustatic events; however, the response of contemporary, easterly sourced, coarse-grade turbidite systems was more complex, with some periods of increased sand and gravel input coinciding with times of rising global sea level.

It was the interaction of these lower order events with the main eustatic cycles {{that appears to have}} been the primary control on sand and gravel input to the Welsh Basin. An early Telychian expansion of the Nant Brianne turbidite system records a marked increase in tectonically generated sediment at a time of palaeo-plate collision between Baltica/Avalonia and Laurentia before intra- and peri-basinal faulting led to its abandonment as a supply path to the basin centre.

40|$|The early Cretaceous fill of the forearc/intra-arc Byers Basin {{includes}} a 600 - to 900 -m-thick interval of marine <b>slope</b> <b>apron</b> deposits, the President Beaches Formation. This is a predominantly argillaceous succession within which coarser-grained deposits are largely confined to lenticular packages of low width–thickness ratios. The entire formation was deposited in mid- to late-Berriasian times, coincident with a pulse of regional arc expansion, at minimum mean accumulation rates of 120 – 225 mm 1000 years– 1. The mudstones are finely laminated, with a restricted benthic macrofauna and minimal bioturbation, indicating relatively inhospitable sea-floor environments. Sand-rich packages occur as 7 - to 30 -m-thick channel-fill units composed chiefly of classical medium-grained turbidites, {{in some cases}} associated with complex high-concentration turbidity current deposits and minor mud-rich debrites. These sand-bodies are apparently elongate along (normal to) the NW-facing palaeoslope implied by slump-fold axes (and the strike of the volcanic arc). Similarly, palaeocurrent indices show a consistent arc-parallel, NE-directed trend, suggesting that transport processes were strongly influenced by the structural ‘grain’ of the irregular slope morphology. Slope instability is recorded by widespread slump and soft-sediment collapse features promoted {{by a combination of}} steep sea-floor gradients and relatively high rates of sedimentation. A lack of systematic vertical facies trends indicates {{that this was not a}} progradational or well-organized system, despite high rates of sediment supply.

40|$|The Northwest African margin is {{affected}} by {{a wide variety of}} sedimentary processes, including pelagic/hemipelagic background sedimentation, alongslope bottom currents, and downslope gravity flows. A large section of the margin can be classified as a fine-grained clastic <b>slope</b> <b>apron,</b> although the presence of numerous volcanic islands and seamounts leads to a more complex distribution of sedimentary processes than is accounted for by existing <b>slope</b> <b>apron</b> models. The Moroccan Turbidite System (MTS) is the largest turbidite system on the margin, with a total length of 1500 km. Individual turbidites can be correlated across three interconnected deep-water basins, giving an unprecedented insight into the turbidite depositional architecture of a system with complex seafioor topography and multiple sources. A detailed, core-based study of the turbidite fill in an intraslope basin within the MTS has revealed that sand body architecture is largely controlled by turbidity current volume. Small-volume turbidity currents deposit all of their sand around the mouth of the feeder canyon, whereas large-volume turbidity currents deposit extensive sheet sands across the basin floor. The large-volume, high efficiency flows excavate giant erosional scours at the canyon mouth, leading to development of a channel-lobe transition zone (CLTZ). Comparison with other CLTZ's has revealed that these zones form in association with flow expansion at a canyon/channel mouth, and may also be linked to major breaks in slope. Deep-water sediment waves are widespread on the margin, and display wave heights up to 70 m, and wavelengths up to 2. 4 km. The largest sediment-wave fields are found on the continental slope and rise bordering the volcanic Canary Islands. Analysis of an integrated dataset, combined with simple numerical modelling, reveals that the sediment waves are deposited as antidunes beneath unconfined, low-velocity, low concentration turbidity currents...|$|R

The turbidite-dominated Pul'gon Formation (Silurian) accumulated in sea-floor depressions and within the inferred basin axis.

The borehole was drilled {{close to the}} crest of the Judd Anticline and penetrated 110. 5 m into the post-breakup Stronsay Group. The borehole proved 23. 8 m of Ypresian–earliest Lutetian paralic to shallow-marine deposits, unconformably overlain by 43. 85 m of mid-Lutetian lower shoreface to shallow-marine shelf deposits, in turn unconformably overlain by 42. 85 m of late Bartonian–Priabonian mass-flow (<b>slope</b> <b>apron)</b> and basinal deposits. At the borehole site, the Ypresian–earliest Lutetian sediments were subaerially exposed in early Lutetian times; these deposits were subsequently transgressed by the mid-Lutetian shelf – itself eroded in the late Lutetian with reworked material transported northwards and redeposited in the Mid-Eocene basin-floor fan complex in Quadrants 213 and 214. The eroded mid-Lutetian shelf was subsequently downlapped and buried beneath prograding late Bartonian–Priabonian slope apron-to-basinal sediments as the borehole site subsided. Integrating the borehole data with the regional seismic-stratigraphy indicates three major intervals of regression – early/mid-Lutetian, late Lutetian and late Bartonian – which, it is suggested, coincide predominantly with tectonic activity, particularly compressional deformation, possibly linking the early post- breakup development of the Faroe-Shetland Basin to the evolution of the adjacent Norwegian Basin...|$|R

Slope development is shown to be complex be-cause of the interaction of slope accretion, sediment bypassing, and submarine erosion to produce a single open-ocean carbonate slope. The present slope north of LBB did not develop until after the complete drowning of the southern Blake Plateau {{near the end of}} the Cretaceous. Beginning in the early Tertiary and continuing through the present, this slope has accreted laterally by the accumulation of periplatform oozes along its upper slope, whereas submarine slides and sediment gravity flows have bypassed the upper slope, resulting in a lower <b>slope</b> <b>apron</b> of slide blocks, turbidites, and debris flows. Slope sedimentation north of LBB was more or less continuous, with the exception of a late Oligocene erosional event that may be correlative with the "Au " unconformity in the western North Atlantic.

Bedding fabrics, largely because of gravitational consolidation, perhaps with some tectonic contribution, increase in intensity with burial depth, but this is irregular, partly because of the effects of bioturbation. Small folds in the <b>slope</b> <b>apron</b> sediments are thought to represent gravitational mass movement, but rare similar structures now deeply buried in the prism may have the same origin. The most common structures are grouped into a family termed deformation bands.

Despite this gradational aspect, the main types of deformation bands are thought to originate independently, according to the mechanical conditions operative at the time, rather than by a progressive evolution. The shear zones and faults show complex substructures and interrelationships and are dominant in the Nankai prism at depths not previously drilled. Whereas features such as the vein structures occurring at 640 mbsf, a hydraulic breccia at 800 mbsf, and subtle textures in the décollement zone owe their origin primarily to overpressuring, the deformation bands reflect focused tectonic deformation in the prism, a direct result of plate convergence...|$|R

The formation was deposited in the Tuscan Domain of the Adria Microplate. This research aims at depicting its depositional architecture and evolution in the type area. Stratigraphic and sedimentologic analyses were performed on a ca. 25 km-long transect that includes depositional systems sectioned both in the down- and along-dip directions.

Calcareous exotics of the Oxfordian- Kimmeridgian age prevail, representing a type of sedimentation comparable to that one documented for the northern Tethyan margin. The Tithonian exotic clasts (Štramberk-type limestones), which are much less common, were formed on a carbonate platform and related slope. The sedimentary paleotransport directions indicate the Silesian Ridge as a main source area for all exotics, which were emplaced in the depositional setting of the flysch deposits.

In this work we investigate the effects of the transition from frontal accretion to frontal erosion on the stability of a subduction complex through the study of a fossil example from the Northern Apennines. New structural data suggest that in the Aquitanian the removal and underthrusting of the toe of the wedge, formed by both the accreted sediments of oceanic affinity and the overlying wedge-top basin fill (i. e., the Subligurian Units), implied a process of frontal tectonic erosion.

Samples used in this study were collected from the <b>slope</b> <b>apron</b> sediment overlying the accretionary prism at Site C 0004 during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 316. The sediments represented microbial habitats above, within, and below the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ), which was observed approximately 20 meters below the seafloor (mbsf). Small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) were extracted, quantified, amplified and sequenced using high-throughput 454 -pyrosequencing, indicating the occurrence of metabolically active bacterial populations to a depth of 57 mbsf. Transcript abundance and bacterial diversity decreased with increasing depth. The two communities below the SMTZ were similar at the phylum level, however only a 24 % overlap was observed at the genus level. Active bacterial community composition was not confined to geochemically predicted redox stratification despite the deepest sample being more than 50 meters below the oxic/anoxic interface. Genus-level classification suggested that the metabolically active subseafloor bacterial populations had similarities to previously cultured organisms. This allowed predictions of physiological potential, expanding understanding of the subseafloor microbial ecosystem. Unique community structures suggest very diverse active populations compared to previous DNA-based diversity estimates, providing more support for enhancing community characterizations using more advanced sequencing techniques...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of study: Sedimentological {{description}} of outcropping deep-water clastics within Mount Messenger Formation. Study area: North-Taranaki coastal region, North Island, New Zealand. Methodology: Mapping on foot and sedimentary logging. Geological setting: The basin-floor fans and channel levee complexes of Miocene Mount Messenger Formation were deposited in fore-deep, intra (sub) continental Taranaki Basin. The basin is mainly submarine, but Mount Messenger Formation crops {{out in the}} study area with a thickness of approximately 700 m. The lower part is dominated by mid fan deposits, the middle part by lower fan deposits, and the upper part by channel-levee deposits. Lithofacies and lithofacies associations: 4 lithofacies associations have been recognized in the lower and middle part of Mount Messenger Formation; 1) massive sandstone association consist of thick beds of massive very fine to fine grained sandstone interbedded with very thin beds of mudstone interpreted as deposits from gravity-flows with laminar flow component interbedded with hemipelagic mud; 2) heterolithic association consist of interbedded thin beds of very fine to fine grained sandstone and mudstone interpreted as high-density turbidity current or sandy debris-flow deposits interbedded with hemipelagic mud; 3) finely-laminated association consist of thick beds of finely-laminated very fine to fine grained sandstone interpreted as turbidity current deposits; 4) deformed association consist of very thick-bedded, heavily deformed interval interpreted as slump-flow deposits. Architectural elements: 3 types of architectural elements are recognized; 1) massive sandstone association or finely-laminated sandstone association dominated sandstone elements interpreted as mid fan deposits; 2) heterolithic association dominated heterolithic elements interpreted as lower fan deposits; and 3) deformed association dominated deformed elements interpreted as deposits from slope failure. Allostratigraphic units: The architectural elements are stacked in successions of sandstone element ― heterolithic element ― deformed element which each define an allostratigraphic unit bounded by the lower erosive surface of sandstone elements (cycle boundaries). A total of 4 units are recognized. Allostratigraphic architecture: The sandstone elements at the base of each allostratigraphic unit are interpreted to represent different depositional environments within the mid fan setting. The depositional environment changes with time from outer mid fan to middle mid fan to inner mid fan, reflecting the overall progradation of the depositional system into the study area. Paleocurrent measurements indicate the direction of progradation was towards the north-west. Paleogeography: Mount Messenger Formation is interpreted as multiple sourced, moderately efficient, shallow incised, channel attached depositional system. Paleocurrent measurements indicate that Allostratigraphic Unit 1 and 2 were fed from 2 sources; slump-flows from the north and sandy gravity-flows from the south-east. Allostratigraphic Unit 3 and 4 were fed from a source located to the south. The formation can be classified as a hybrid between a sand-rich <b>slope</b> <b>apron</b> and a mixed sand-mud <b>slope</b> <b>apron</b> depositional system in the classification introduced by Reading & Richards (1994). Controls on stratigraphic architecture: 3 stratigraphic time hierarchies are recognized within the studied deposits; 1) onset of Mount Messenger deposition representing a low-frequency hierarchy with several million years or more duration interpreted to result from interacting factors of sediment supply, subsidence and eustasy, but ultimately controlled by the uplift in the south-east; 2) rhythmic stacking of architectural elements representing a medium-frequency hierarchy with 100 - 200 thousand years duration interpreted to result from tectonic processes; and 3) thinning-up successions within architectural elements representing a high-frequency hierarchy with 10 ’s of thousands years duration interpreted to result from autogenic processes. </p...|$|R
40|$|In the landslide-prone {{area near}} the Nice {{international}} airport, southeastern France, an interdisciplinary approach is applied to develop realistic lithological/geometrical profiles and geotechnical/strength sub-seafloor models. Such models are indispensable for slope stability assessments using limit equilibrium or finite element methods. Regression analyses, based on the undrained shear strength (su) of intact gassy sediments are used to generate a sub-seafloor strength model based on 37 short dynamic and eight long static piezocone penetration tests, and laboratory experiments on one Calypso piston and 10 gravity cores. Significant strength variations were detected when comparing measurements from the shelf and the shelf break, with a significant drop in su to 5. 5 kPa being interpreted as a weak zone at a depth between 6. 5 and 8. 5 m below seafloor (mbsf). Here, a 10 % reduction of the in situ total unit weight compared to the surrounding sediments is found to coincide with coarse-grained layers that turn into a weak zone and detachment plane for former and present-day gravitational, retrogressive slide events, as seen in 2 D chirp profiles. The combination of high-resolution chirp profiles and comprehensive geotechnical information allows us to compute enhanced 2 D finite element slope stability analysis with undrained sediment response compared to previous 2 D numerical and 3 D limit equilibrium assessments. Those models suggest that significant portions (detachment planes at 20 m or even 55 mbsf) of the Quaternary delta and <b>slope</b> <b>apron</b> deposits may be mobilized. Given that factors of safety are equal or less than 1 when further considering the effect of free gas, a high risk for a landslide event of considerable size off Nice international airport is identifie...|$|R
40|$|Sequence stratigraphical {{concepts}} {{are applied to}} a 55 km long transect through the uppermost Ordovician and lower Silurian rocks of the Welsh Basin and the adjoining Midland Platform. The study focuses on sedimentary rocks deposited during the Llandovery epoch (about 439 ? 430 Ma). An early Llandovery <b>slope</b> <b>apron</b> of hemipelagite and laterally supplied mudstone turbidites shows the influence of eustatic sea-level changes. Two complete depositional sequences are recognized. Transgressions and highstands on the platform were accompanied by laminated hemipelagite deposition in the basin, recording anoxic bottom waters in a stratified watermass. The intervening regressions generated unconformities on the platform and produced bioturbated basinal sediments in a more oxic environment. By contrast, the extent and timing of sandstone-turbidite and debrite systems in the basin are strongly affected by tectonic activity. Easterly derived late Llandovery facies relate directly to faulting and submarine mass wasting along the basin margin. Southerly derived late Llandovery to mid-Wenlock sandstone-lobe systems were the products of tectonic uplift in extrabasinal source areas and were partially confined within intrabasinal tilted fault blocks. Subsidence analysis confirms a basinal stretching event in late Llandovery (Telychian) time and shows that it also affected the adjacent Midland Platform. The depositional systems of this period constitute elements of a dual-sourced depositional sequence, within which eustatic effects are masked by the strong influence of relative base-level changes attendant to tectonism. The architecture of the early Silurian Welsh Basin illustrates the complexities of applying sequence stratigraphical models where there is an interleaving of several depositional systems, each modulated by a different mix of eustatic, tectonic and input controls.

40|$|Modeling aims to {{characterize}} system behavior and achieve simulation {{close as possible}} of the reality. The rapid energy exchange in supercritical flow to generate quiet or subcritical flow in hydraulic jump phenomenon is important in design of hydraulic structures. Experimental and numerical modeling is done on type B hydraulic jump which starts first on sloping bed and its end on horizontal bed.   Four different <b>apron</b> <b>slopes</b> are used, for {{each one of these}} slopes the jump is generated on different locations by controlling the tail water depth.   Modelling validation is based on 120 experimental runs which they show that there is reliability. The air volume fraction which creates in through hydraulic jump varied between 0. 18 and 0. 28. While the energy exchanges process take place within 6. 6, 6. 1, 5. 8, 5. 5 of the average relative jump height for <b>apron</b> <b>slopes</b> of 0. 18, 0. 14, 0. 10, 0. 07 respectively.

40|$|Leg 170 {{investigated}} {{mass and}} fluid flux through a subduction complex unencumbered by fluctuations of turbidite deposition in the trench axis. The {{strategy was to}} drill a complete reference site through the sediments and into the basement in the trench (CR- 1, Site 1039), a site in the lower, deformed wedge through the dcollement and into basement (CR- 2, Site 1040), and a site higher up on the continental slope to determine the composition and age of material making up a highamplitude, high-velocity reflector at about 500 m beneath a sedimentary <b>slope</b> <b>apron</b> (CR- 3, Site 1041). Additional sites CR- 6 (Site 1043) and CR- 7 (Site 1042) were defined on board and drilled based on operational developments and scientific needs. Material drilled beneath the continental slope could then be examined for any signs of offscraped oceanic crust material by comparison with the reference section. Further objectives included {{an understanding of the}} cause of regionally very low heat flow through the Cocos Plate and continental slope, and the nature of gas hydrate known to occur within the slope sediments. Site 1039 provided an excellent reference site, recovering a complete, 378 -m thick sedimentary section that bottomed in gabbroic sills, as well as a complete section of high-quality logging-whiledrilling (LWD) data. Geochemical data at this site showed evidence of a seawater source deep in the section, implying flow of water through seafloor conduits (faults?) into {{the upper part of the}} crust and possibly explaining the low heat flow. Sites 1040 and 1043 were drilled through the lowermost slope, penetrating the dcollement at 371 mbsf and 151 mbsf, respectively, and recovering the underthrust sedimentary section to total depths of 661 mbsf and 282 mbsf, respectively. Site 1040 also bottomed [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Submarine canyons in the Bellingshausen and Riiser-Larsen Seas are compared. It {{is pointed}} out that the canyons in the Bellingshausen Sea are so {{incorporated}} to build up a deep-sea fan or an <b>apron</b> <b>slope,</b> that they develop dominantly on an upper fan at the upper continental rise and disappear apparently on a lower fan at the lower continental rise. The deep-sea fan or the <b>apron</b> <b>slope</b> was formed by supply of the great amount of sediments from the shelf area due probably to grounded ice sheets on the continental margin. On the contrary, the canyons in the Riiser-Larsen Sea have a large-scale entrenching throughout their course and construct a canyon-deep sea channel complex. This is caused by thermal cooling effect of lithosphere to deepen the old ocean basin. Buried canyons observed on the seismic profiles indicate that activation of the canyon formation was triggered by advancement of the Antarctic ice sheet toward {{the outer edge of the}} continental shelf sometime between 4 and 7 Ma BP. The meltwater and eroded sediments by the extended grounded ice sheet provided a potential source for turbidity currents and debris flows into the canyons, thus causing rigorous development of the canyon...|$|R
