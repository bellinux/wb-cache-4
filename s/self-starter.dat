25|$|An {{automobile}} <b>self-starter</b> is {{an electric}} motor that initiates rotational motion in an internal combustion engine before it can power itself, therefore eliminating the hand crank used to start engines. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering invented the automobile <b>self-starter</b> while working at National Cash Register and then sold them for installation on cars at the Cadillac company. There had been many attempts at producing an electric starter before, {{but none of them}} were successful. Most designs at that time called for the use of {{an electric motor}} attached to the engine's flywheel. However, in order to fit in the car's engine compartment, the device would have to be small, and therefore it would be unable to produce a sufficient enough amount of torque.|$|E
25|$|Development of {{automotive}} technology was rapid, {{due in part}} to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric <b>self-starter</b> (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910–1911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.|$|E

25|$|Eastern {{hemisphere}} The 10th, 11th, 12th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd houses. A subject who {{has most}} {{of his or her}} planets in this hemisphere will be a <b>self-starter</b> who chooses their own path through life and sets their own boundaries. They are not happy being a burden to other people, or being kept by someone else. They also have the burden themselves of being an initiator at work and in their personal life, as little is likely to be done for them by others. When the planets are in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd houses, the subject is likely to be very self-absorbed and convinced that his or her own opinions are the only ones that matter.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{released}} {{their debut}} album Sing the Greys in May 2006 on local label, Hits The Fan. The band {{was offered a}} deal from Fiction Records but ultimately the label withdrew their offer. In January 2007, The <b>Self-Starter</b> Foundation brought the band to the East Coast of the United States for a short tour. The band returned to the United States in March to play SXSW. [...] Brighton indie label Fat Cat Records released a remixed/remastered version of the album in the USA in October 2007, distributed by Caroline Distribution. The band then embarked on a full American tour. The album was released in the UK in November 2007.|$|E

50|$|Kettering's key insight lay in devising an {{electrical}} system that performed the three purposes {{it continues to}} serve in modern cars: starter and, as generator, producer of spark for ignition as well as current for lighting. Leland approved their product for his 1912 model and placed an order for 12,000 <b>self-starters.</b> Delco, {{the research and development}} outfit, had to quickly learn the business of production.|$|R

50|$|The Ford Model T {{relied on}} hand cranks until 1919; by 1920 most {{manufacturers}} included <b>self-starters,</b> thus ensuring that anyone, regardless of strength or physical handicap, could easily start {{a car with}} an internal combustion engine. It was still common for cars to be supplied with starter handles into the 1960s, and this continued much later for some makes (e.g. Citroën 2CV until end of production in 1990).|$|R

The educational startup now counts over 2,600 videos in its library, with sessions or classes on everything from arithmetic to physics, including 211 practice exercises, to let students watch videos and learn at their leisure.|$|R
50|$|The Startix {{automatic}} {{engine starting}} mechanism was a relay {{in a small}} box added to the vehicle's electrical system. It automatically started an engine from cold or if stalled. It was supplied to vehicle manufacturers in the mid 1930s and later as an aftermarket accessory — in the USA by Bendix Aviation Corporation Eclipse Machine Division and in UK by Joseph Lucas & Son both of which businesses made electric <b>self-starters.</b> Such devices {{are now part of}} the engine management systems which switch off and on to conserve fuel.|$|R
60|$|Billie meanwhile, with Bream {{trotting}} docilely at her heels, {{had reached}} the garage and started the car. Like all cars which have been spending a considerable time in secluded inaction, it did not start readily. At each application of Billie's foot on the <b>self-starter,</b> it emitted a tinny and reproachful sound and then seemed {{to go to sleep}} again. Eventually, however, the engines began to revolve and the machine moved reluctantly out into the drive.|$|E

The “lunch” {{turned out to be}} a seven course dinner and each course introduced such an enticing and unusual dish that every member of the party became an audacious gormandizer. None of the girls—except Louise—had ever tasted such concoctions before, or might even guess what many of them were composed of; but all agreed with Patsy when she energetically asserted that “Castro out-cheffed both Rector and Sherry.” ...|$|E
60|$|Collins {{was already}} on his feet. He had {{straightened}} himself wonderfully, {{and there was a}} new alertness in his manner. He, too, wore rubber shoes and his movements were absolutely noiseless. He carried a little electric torch in his hand, which he flashed around the room while he placed several small articles in his pocket. Then he pushed open the door and listened. He turned back, held up his finger and nodded. The two men passed down the stairs, through the sitting-room, out on to the lawn by a door left unfastened, and round the house to the shed. Together they pushed the car down the slight incline of the drive. Granet mounted into the driving-seat and pressed the <b>self-starter.</b> Collins took the place by his side.|$|E

I’ll certainly be conscious of those things but we’re all professionals, we all understand what we need to do, and we’re all kind of <b>self-starters</b> and kind of take care of ourselves very well so it shouldn’t be much different than when Doug Wheelock, the previous commander, was in charge." ...|$|R
60|$|Milt {{left the}} Old Home rather aimlessly. He {{told himself that}} he {{positively}} would not go back and help Ben Sittka get out the prof's car. So he went back and helped Ben get out the prof's car, and drove the same to the prof's. The prof, otherwise professor, otherwise mister, James Martin Jones, B.A., and Mrs. James Martin Jones welcomed him almost as noisily as had Mac. They begged him to come in. With Mr. Jones he discussed--no, ye Claires of Brooklyn Heights, this garage man and this threadbare young superintendent of a paintbare school, talking {{in a town that}} was only a comma on the line, did not discuss corn-growing, nor did they reckon to guess that by heck the constabule was carryin' on with the Widdy Perkins. They spoke of fish-culture, Elihu Root, the spiritualistic evidences of immortality, government ownership, <b>self-starters</b> for flivvers, and the stories of Irvin Cobb.|$|R
50|$|Deeds and Kettering had {{previously}} worked together in several ventures. Deeds' DELCO produced automobile <b>self-starters</b> developed by Kettering. The two used DELCO's profits {{to form the}} Dayton Metal Products Company. Then they formed the Dayton Airplane Company in 1917, which was soon reorganized as the Dayton-Wright Company. When the war began, Deeds was commissioned and {{put in charge of}} procurement for the Aircraft Production Board. He divested himself of his financial interest in Dayton-Wright but awarded the company two contracts to produce more than 4,000 DH-4 and Standard SJ-1 aircraft. Given the company's inexperience, the size of its contract led to charges of favoritism. A United States Senate committee corroborated these allegations, and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson appointed a commission headed by future Supreme Court of the United States Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes to investigate. Although mismanagement and favoritism were documented, charges were not brought, and the company survived the scandal. It went on to produce the XPS-1, the first airplane held by the U.S. Army with retractable landing gear.|$|R
60|$|Dudley Pickering {{was not a}} <b>self-starter</b> in the motordrome of love. He needed cranking. He {{was that}} most unpromising of matrimonial material, a shy man with a {{cautious}} disposition. If he overcame his shyness, caution applied the foot-brake. If he succeeded in forgetting caution, shyness shut off the gas. At Reigelheimer's some miracle had made him not only reckless but un-self-conscious. Possibly the Dream of Psyche had gone to his head. At any rate, {{he had been on}} the very verge of proposing to Claire when the interruption had occurred, and in bed that night, reviewing the affair, he had been appalled at the narrowness of his escape from taking a definite step. Except in the way of business, {{he was a man who}} hated definite steps. He never accepted even a dinner invitation without subsequent doubts and remorse. The consequence was that, in the days that followed the Reigelheimer episode, what Lord Wetherby would have called the lamp of love burned rather low in Mr Pickering, as if the acetylene were running out. He still admired Claire intensely and experienced disturbing emotions when he beheld her perfect tonneau and wonderful headlights; but he regarded her with a cautious fear. Although he sometimes dreamed sentimentally of marriage in the abstract, of actual marriage, of marriage with a flesh-and-blood individual, of marriage that involved clergymen and 'Voices that Breathe o'er Eden,' and giggling bridesmaids and cake, Dudley Pickering was afraid with a terror that woke him sweating in the night. His shyness shrank from the ceremony, his caution jibbed at the mysteries of married life. So his attitude toward Claire, the only girl who had succeeded in bewitching him into the opening words of an actual proposal, was a little less cordial and affectionate than if she had been a rival automobile manufacturer.|$|E

50|$|The Loden Foundation {{is one of}} {{the pioneers}} in {{promoting}} entrepreneurship in Bhutan. Aimed at benefitting young graduates from schools and colleges, the foundation runs business training programmes, gives interest-free capital funds up to $30,000 to start businesses and provides support through its mentorship programme, monitoring scheme and resource centre. The programme was launched in 2008 in order to help promote entrepreneurship in Bhutan through the inspiration and support from Loden's longstanding friends Gerard Tardy and Anne Tardy. As thousands of young people leave schools and colleges, unemployment started to grow. Civil service which was the main employer in the past is now saturated and private sector is still only beginning. The programme aims to help <b>self-starters</b> in business. It also aims to help develop a responsible and sustainable entrepreneurial culture in Bhutan, inspired by the visionary and altruistic Bodhisattva ideals. The foundation has trained over 1500 entrepreneurs from 2008-2014 and provided interest-free capital seed money to 77 entrepreneurial ventures which are spread across 18 districts in Bhutan.|$|R
50|$|Wurtsmith got {{its start}} in 1923 as Loud-Reames Aviation Field, a soft-surface landing site for Army Air Corps {{aircraft}} from Selfridge Field. It was renamed Camp Skeel in 1924, for World War I pilot Captain Burt E. Skeel, and {{was used as an}} aerial gunnery range and for winter maneuvers 1924 through 1944 by the 1st Pursuit Group at Selfridge Army Air Base near Detroit. During those winter maneuvers the army pilots and mechanics battled snow squalls and bitter cold temperatures to get the engines of the planes started. Oil was heated in drums over open fires of pitchpine and then poured into the engines. Crews then worked fast to get the engines running before the oil congealed. No <b>self-starters</b> were available on those early planes so engines were cranked by hand by swinging the propellers. Aviation gasoline to refuel the planes was hauled across the ice-covered lake on a six-foot hand sled which held two barrels. After 1927 the field was also used for aerial gunnery practice.|$|R

3000|$|Another {{organizational}} form, {{relatively new}} {{in terms of}} its pervasiveness, is a platform facilitated enterprise, often designed to maximize the speed of customer service and/or to minimize labor costs. In America, Uber is currently the most conspicuous example of a platform-facilitated company. A platform is a specific combination of information and communication technology that connects different groups of people and allows them to engage in mutually beneficial exchanges (such as do Uber’s drive-partners and their customers). Uber’s “drive-partners are not employees (absolutely not!) but independent micro-entrepreneurs. They do not work for Uber: They work for themselves. [...]. [...]. [...]. Such organizations provide the platform for a market that matches those who have tasks to do with <b>self-starters</b> willing to do them” (Davis 2016 a, p. 124, see also Davis 2016 a, p. 145) (parentheses enclosed phrase in this quotation is Davis’). “Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is another platform that offers ‘Turkers’ the chance to engage in ‘Human Intelligence Tasks’ (HITS) for a piece rate determined by how much they bid” (Davis, 2016 a, p. 124). It {{is important to note that}} not only do these platform structures reduce labor costs; they also exploit the capabilities of modern information and communication technologies to maximize the speed of customer service.|$|R
40|$|A {{recent report}} from Research Perspectives on Migration {{points out that}} {{immigrants}} often have the same personal characteristics as entrepreneurs. They are risk-takers, <b>self-starters</b> and optimistic by nature. This is borne out, they say, {{by the fact that}} immigrants {{are more likely to be}} self-employed than natives in every census from 1880 to 1990. While many immigrant storefront businesses are small and tend to employ co-ethnics and family, they are powerful in their aggregate and credited with revitalizing declining neighborhoods. Other faces of immigrant entrepreneurship have also emerged. Fast growing companies started by immigrants with annual revenues in the millions are coming to light in such industries as food distribution, transportation and building services. Both small and large engineering, technology, and science firms are leading innovation and new product development to keep the U. S. globally competitive. All of these immigrant businesses are creating jobs and strengthening the economy across America. The actual and potential of immigrant entrepreneurs as engines for economic growth in urban areas, local economies and centers of innovation to keep the U. S. globally competitive are beginning to be recognized in economic circles. In Massachusetts, immigrant storefront entrepreneurs continue to revitalize economically depressed neighborhoods. (1) Immigrants also co- founded 25. 7 percent of the biotechnology companies in the state, helping to keep Massachusetts a vital center for innovation.
