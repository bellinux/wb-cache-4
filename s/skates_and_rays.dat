5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} {{different}} from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (<b>skates</b> <b>and</b> <b>rays)</b> have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.|$|E

40|$|The {{elasmobranchs}} {{represented by}} sharks, <b>skates</b> (sawfishes,guitar fishes) <b>and</b> <b>rays</b> {{are an important}} group of demersal fishes which are exploited for multifarious uses of their various body parts such as the meat, fins, liver, teeth and the hide. While shark fins are considered as a delicacy fetching increased export market, their liver oil is utilized in pharmaceutical industry. Shark teeth is used for ornamental purposes and their hide {{for a variety of}} leather products. This increased commercial demand coupled with their characteristic life history pattern including slow growth rate, delayed maturation, long reproductive cycle, low fecundity and long life span and their trans-boundary migration pattern make them susceptible to over fishing. Because of this background, of late there had been a growing international awareness over the conservation and management of the elasmobranch stocks. This in turn necessitates an understanding of resource characteristics and eco-biological features of different species of sharks, <b>skates</b> <b>and</b> <b>ray...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Hybodontiformes, {{also called}} hybodonts, are an extinct subset of Elasmobranchii (sharks, <b>skates</b> <b>and</b> <b>rays)</b> which existed from the Devonian to the Miocene. They form {{the group of}} sharks closest to neoselachians, the clade of modern sharks and rays. Hybodonts were named and are {{distinguished}} based on their conical tooth shape. They comprised the main group of Jurassic sharks in Europe and North America. [...] They survived into the Late Cretaceous before going extinct, possibly due to competition from other sharks, though forms like Miosynechodus endured {{as recently as the}} Miocene. Lonchidion {{was one of the last}} hybodonts— its distinctive serrated fine spines occur in freshwater deposits from Wyoming alongside the fossils of the last dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops.Hybodontiformes are identified in the fossil record predominantly based on distinct teeth and fin spines. They were known to live in both fresh and salt water environments.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{have shown}} that some chondrichthyans can {{regenerate}} rhodopsin by cellular regeneration, micro RNA organ regeneration, teeth physiological teeth regeneration, and reparative skin regeneration. Rhodopsin regeneration has been studied in <b>skates</b> <b>and</b> <b>rays.</b> After complete photo-bleaching, rhodopsin can completely regenerate within 2 hours in the retina. [...] White bamboo sharks can regenerate at least two-thirds of their liver {{and this has been}} linked to three micro RNAs, xtr-miR-125b, fru-miR-204, and has-miR-142-3p_R-. In one study two thirds of the liver was removed and within 24 hours {{more than half of the}} liver had undergone hypertrophy. [...] Leopard sharks routinely replace their teeth every 9–12 days [...] and this is an example of physiological regeneration. This can occur because shark teeth are not attached to a bone, but instead are developed within a bony cavity. [...] It has been estimated that the average shark loses about 30,000 to 40,000 teeth in a lifetime. [...] Some sharks can regenerate scales and even skin following damage. Within two weeks of skin wounding the mucus is secreted into the wound and this initiates the healing process. One study showed that the majority of the wounded area was regenerated within 4 months, but the regenerated area also showed a high degree of variability.|$|E

5000|$|Big skates are {{frequently}} caught by recreational anglers, who usually release or discard them. They adapt well to captivity {{and are often}} displayed in public aquaria. This species {{is one of the}} three most important skates fished off the coast of California, though compared to other commercial fisheries, it is of only minor importance. This species is usually taken as bycatch in bottom trawls; the pectoral fins are sold as [...] "skate wings" [...] and are eaten baked or fried, often being labeled as imitation scallops. In the 1990s, the market value of skate wings rose to US$0.40-$1.00 per pound, and catches of the big skate off California increased tenfold as the trawl fishery began marketing its <b>skate</b> <b>and</b> <b>ray</b> bycatch. In 2003, a targeted fishery for the big <b>skate</b> <b>and</b> the longnose <b>skate</b> (Raja rhina) commenced in the Gulf of Alaska.

40|$|Landings of seafish are {{recorded}} under three broad headings, namely, demersal fish, pelagic fish and shellfish. The term demersal {{is applied to}} fish which live {{the greater part of}} their lives at or relatively near the sea bed. Demersal fish include roundfish such as whiting, cod, haddock, pollock and hake; flatfish such as plaice, sole, dabs, flounder, and also commercially valuable shark type fish such as <b>skate</b> <b>and</b> <b>ray.</b> The term pelagic is applied to fish which live the greater part of their lives in the upper layers of water and includes herrings, sprats, pilchards and mackerel. Shellfish include crawfish, lobsters, Nephrops (Dublin Bay prawns), crabs, shrimps and prawns all of which are known collectively as cruatacea; and escallops, mussels, oysters, periwinkles and various clams, which are known collectively as molluscs.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 In the past, sharks, <b>skates</b> <b>and</b> <b>ray</b> {{species have}} mainly {{occurred}} in incidental fisheries. Now they {{are increasingly being}} directly targeted due to the depleted status of traditionally targeted species. The life history characteristics of many elasmobranch species make them more sensitive to high rates of fishing mortality. The combination of these factors {{has resulted in the}} known local depletion of several elasmobranch species; including the barndoor skate, Raja laevis, of the Northwest Atlantic <b>and</b> the common <b>skate,</b> Raja batis, of Irish Sea. The longnose skate, Raja rhina, occurs commonly as incidental catch in trawl fisheries off the coast of California, Oregon and Washington. Commercial landings of skates, including R. rhina, have increased dramatically along the U. S. West coast. The objectives of this study have been to calculate accurate growth and maturity parameters for Raja rhina in order that the vulnerability of this species to fishing mortality can be assessed.

5000|$|Batoids {{reproduce}} in {{a number}} of ways. As is characteristic of elasmobranchs, batoids undergo internal fertilisation. Internal fertilisation is advantageous to batoids as it conserves sperm, does not expose eggs to consumption by predators, and ensures that all the energy involved in reproduction is retained and not lost to the environment. [...] All <b>skates</b> <b>and</b> some <b>rays</b> are oviparous (egg laying) while other rays are ovoviviparous, meaning that they give birth to young which develop in a womb but without involvement of a placenta.|$|R

40|$|This Fisheries Science Partnership {{project was}} {{developed}} to estimate the longer-term survivorship and movements of thornback ray Raja clavata in the southern North Sea, using traditional tagging methods. Thornback ray is the dominant skate species taken in targeted and mixed fisheries in this area, and is taken in various trawl, line and gillnet fisheries. Five inshore vessels {{were used in the}} study, with seven trips planned in order to examine the catches and survivorship following capture by small otter trawlers, gillnetters and longline vessels.
