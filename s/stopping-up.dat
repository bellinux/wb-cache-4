50|$|A {{right-of-way}} may {{be created}} by custom (by the way being used {{for a long period}} of time) or under the relevant Sections of the Highways Act of 1980. A right-of-way may be extinguished or diverted in a number of ways, such as by an Act of Parliament, by a magistrates' <b>stopping-up</b> or diversion order, or by powers given to principal local authorities. For instance, under the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act of 1996, authority was given for the builder of this railway link to stop up certain highways that are mentioned in Schedule 3 of the act.|$|E
50|$|In October 2005, Leicester City Council {{released}} an engineer's report {{indicating that the}} bridge could only support its own weight and would need £775,000 to keep it intact {{over the next three}} years. Full restoration would cost £2.5 million according to the report. The Council planned to demolish the bridge by Summer 2006 but had to revise its plans once it was discovered that, as the bridge was still classed as a public highway which used to carry the Great Central Way footpath, a formal <b>stopping-up</b> order extinguishing the highway would have to be obtained. This process would take up to a year. By March 2008 the order had still not yet been granted and considerable local opposition against the plans was manifesting itself on the internet with more than 2,500 people joining a campaign on the Facebook website, and a further 1,200 signing a petition on the 10 Downing Street website.|$|E
50|$|The {{court hearing}} for the <b>stopping-up</b> order took place 4 June 2008 at Leicester Magistrates' Court. Representatives from the Ramblers Association, the Victorian Society, the Footpath Association, Leicester Civic Society and Leicestershire Industrial History Society were present. The Council {{applied for the}} order under Section 116 of the Highways Act 1980 to have 410 m of the bridge and viaduct closed, thereby {{avoiding}} the public enquiry {{that would have been}} necessary if Section 118 (also concerned with closure) had been used. The hearing was adjourned until 17 June when the application was due to be heard by a district judge and a date set for a full hearing of the case. Following a three-day hearing, District Judge John Stobart granted the Council's application on 9 October 2008. Six local organisations and 6,000 petitioners had challenged the Council's decision. A local woman was subsequently arrested after staging a 12-hour occupation protest on the bridge.|$|E
