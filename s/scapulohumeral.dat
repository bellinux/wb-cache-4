50|$|The <b>scapulohumeral</b> {{muscles are}} {{a group of}} seven muscles that connect the humerus to the scapula. They are amongst the muscles that act on and {{stabilise}} the glenohumeral joint in the human body.|$|E
5000|$|Shoulder joint (<b>scapulohumeral</b> joint): {{usually has}} an angle of 120-130 degrees when {{the horse is}} standing, which can {{extended}} to 145 degrees, and flexed to 80 degrees (such as when the horse is jumping and obstacle).|$|E
50|$|The teres major muscle (Latin teres meaning 'rounded') is {{a muscle}} {{of the upper}} limb. It {{attaches}} to the scapula and the humerus {{and is one of}} the seven <b>scapulohumeral</b> muscles. It is a thick but somewhat flattened muscle.|$|E
5000|$|Latissimus dorsi: {{originates}} at the supraspinous ligament & thoracolumbar fascia, inserts in the humerus. Antagonist to brachiocephalicus. Supports the back, {{helps to}} pull {{the body of the}} horse forward when a limb is extended and placed on the ground, also helps to flex the <b>scapulohumeral</b> joint.|$|E
50|$|By {{being so}} shallow the glenoid cavity allows the {{shoulder}} joint {{to have the}} greatest mobility of all joints in the body, allowing 120 degrees of unassisted flexion. Additional range of motion in shoulder flexion (typically up to 180 degrees in humans) is also accomplished by the great mobility of the scapula (shoulder blade) through {{a process known as}} <b>scapulohumeral</b> rhythm.|$|E

Includes the trapezius cervicalis (originates along the cervical vertebrae) and trapezius thoracis (originates along the thoracic vertebrae). Helps to raise the shoulder, also involved in moving the <b>scapulohumeral</b> joint. Well-developed if horse is worked round and [...] "up through the back." ...|$|E
5000|$|In anatomy, the {{rotator cuff}} (sometimes called a [...] "rotator cup", [...] "rotor cuff", or [...] "rotary cup") {{is a group}} of muscles and their tendons that act to {{stabilize}} the shoulder. The four muscles of the rotator cuff are over half of the seven <b>scapulohumeral</b> muscles. The four muscles are the supraspinatus muscle, the infraspinatus muscle, teres minor muscle, and the subscapularis muscle.|$|E
50|$|The {{muscles of}} the {{shoulder}} can be categorized into three topographic units: the <b>scapulohumeral,</b> axiohumeral, and axioscapular groups. Serratus anterior forms part of the latter group together with rhomboid major, rhomboid minor, levator scapulae, and trapezius. The trapezius evolved separately, but the other three muscles in this group evolved from the first eight or ten ribs and the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae (homologous to the ribs).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} group, the <b>scapulohumeral</b> or {{glenohumeral}} joint is the anatomical joint mechanically {{linked to the}} physiological subdeltoid or suprahumeral joint (the [...] "second shoulder joint") so that movements in the latter results in movements in the former. In the second group, the scapulocostal or scapulothoracic joint is the important physiological joint that can not function without the two anatomical joints in the group, the acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joints, i.e. they join {{both ends of the}} clavicle.|$|E
50|$|The {{movement}} of the scapula across the rib cage {{in relation to the}} humerus is known as the <b>scapulohumeral</b> rhythm, and this helps to achieve a further range of movement. This range can be compromised by anything that changes the position of the scapula. This could be an imbalance in parts of the large trapezius muscles that hold the scapula in place. Such an imbalance could cause a forward head carriage which in turn can affect the range of movements of the shoulder.|$|E
50|$|The {{muscles of}} the {{shoulder}} can be categorized into three topographic units: the <b>scapulohumeral,</b> axiohumeral, and axioscapular groups. Levator scapulae forms part of the latter group together with rhomboid major, rhomboid minor, serratus anterior, and trapezius. The trapezius evolved separately, but the other three muscles in this group evolved from the first eight or ten ribs and the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae (homologous to the ribs). The serratus anterior formed the basal unit for these three muscles. In higher primates it has evolved into two separate muscles — serratus anterior and levator scapulae — by concentration of the proximal and distal fibers and progressive reduction of the intermediate fibers. The fibers concerned with the cranial displacement of the scapula became the levator scapulae.|$|E
50|$|The {{muscles of}} the {{shoulder}} can be categorized into three topographic units: the <b>scapulohumeral,</b> axiohumeral, and axioscapular groups. Stretching from the spine to the scapula, rhomboid major forms part of the latter group together with rhomboid minor, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and trapezius. The trapezius has evolved separately, but the other muscles in this group evolved from the first eight or ten ribs and the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae (homologous to the ribs). Functional demands {{has resulted in the}} evolution of individual muscles from the basal unit formed by the serratus anterior. In primitive life forms, the main function of the axioscapular group is to control the movements of the vertebral border of the scapula: fibers concerned with the dorsal movement of scapula evolved into the rhomboids, those with ventral motion into serratus anterior, and those with cranial movements into levator scapulae.|$|E
50|$|A {{winged scapula}} (scapula alata) is a {{skeletal}} medical {{condition in which}} the shoulder blade, or shoulder bone, protrudes from a person’s back in an abnormal position. In rare conditions {{it has the potential}} to lead to limited functional activity in the upper extremity to which it is adjacent. It can affect a person’s ability to lift, pull, and push weighty objects. In some serious cases, the ability to perform activities of daily living such as changing one’s clothes and washing one’s hair may be hindered. The name of this condition comes from its appearance, a wing-like resemblance, due to the medial border of the scapula sticking straight out from the back. Scapular winging has been observed to disrupt <b>scapulohumeral</b> rhythm, contributing to decreased flexion and abduction of the upper extremity, as well as a loss in power and the source of considerable pain. A winged scapula is considered normal posture in young children, but not older children and adults.|$|E

40|$|Overhead athletes {{including}} those in racket sports, throwers, volleyball players, and swim-mers require full, unrestricted use of their upper extremity to compete at optimal levels. Scapulothoracic and <b>scapulohumeral</b> (rotator-cuff) muscle function are critical for normal overhead activities of the shoulder and {{play an important role}} in normal shoulder function. Furthermore, weakness of scapulothoracic and <b>scapulohumeral</b> muscles is a common cause of shoulder pathology. The primary purpose of this article is to describe therapeutic exercises that activate scapulothoracic and <b>scapulohumeral</b> muscles that are derived from literature examining the electromyographical (EMG) activation of the scapular muscles. Thera-peutic exercises have been investigated using surface and indwelling EMG in order to determine to what level specific scapulothoracic and <b>scapulohumeral</b> muscles are activated. Electromyographic studies will be used in this article to provide a rationale for exercise recommendations to strengthen scapulothoracic and scapulo-humeral muscles...|$|E
40|$|Osteochondrosis is {{a common}} {{developmental}} abnormality affecting the subchondral bone of immature, large breed dogs. The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe CT lesions detected in <b>scapulohumeral</b> joints of 32 immature dogs undergoing CT for thoracic limb lameness. Eight dogs (14 <b>scapulohumeral</b> joints) had arthroscopy following imaging. Thirteen dogs (19 <b>scapulohumeral</b> joints) {{were found to have}} CT lesions, including 10 dogs (16 <b>scapulohumeral</b> joints) with subchondral bone lesions and 3 dogs with enthesopathy of the supraspinatus tendon. In one dog, subchondral bone lesions appeared as large oval defects within the mid-aspect of the glenoid cavities, bilaterally. These lesions resembled osseous cyst-like lesions commonly identified in the horse. This is the first report of such a presentation of a subchondral bone lesion in the glenoid cavity of a dog. In all dogs, small, focal, round or linear lucent defects were visible within the cortical bone at the junction of the greater tubercle and intertubercular groove. These structures were thought to represent vascular channels. Findings from this study support the use of CT as an adjunct modality for the identification and characterization of <b>scapulohumeral</b> subchondral bone lesions in immature dogs with thoracic limb lameness...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{collection}} of studies was to further develop the knowledge of shoulder motion {{in order to better}} understand joint function through direct measurement of 3 D <b>scapulohumeral</b> joint kinematics using a technique of high accuracy. Markerless, bi-planar fluoroscopic radiostereometric analysis using a generic shoulder model was developed in this thesis, reducing the amount of radiation exposure to subjects. The studies compared kinematic data of the <b>scapulohumeral</b> joint in six degrees of freedom with a precise, in-vivo measuring technique. Data were collected on young and older healthy individuals, individuals with a torn supraspinatus and post-surgical intervention. Although this generic model method has higher error than other biplanar fluoroscopic techniques, it is still more accurate than skin-based motion capture techniques. Younger and older healthy groups have similar <b>scapulohumeral</b> motion patterns for abduction, forward flexion and a more complex motion of arm across the chest. Major differences were noted during humeral abduction when comparing an age-matched controlled group to groups with injured supraspinatus muscles and post-surgical repair of the supraspinatus muscles. In the injured group, there is significantly higher <b>scapulohumeral</b> rhythm which is significantly lowered post-surgery. These are the first studies of this nature using generic models to analyze <b>scapulohumeral</b> kinematics. Future research could include the evaluation of muscle function before and after repair in tandem with kinematic results and comparisons of the <b>scapulohumeral</b> kinematics between different surgical repair techniques. This information will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment plans based on the needs of each individual patient...|$|E

40|$|Rotator cuff muscle {{degeneration}} is {{an important}} parameter to consider when planning shoulder arthroplasty. We hypothesized that rotator cuff muscle degeneration is correlated with <b>scapulohumeral</b> subluxation in patients planned for anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). We developed a semi-automated quantitative CT method to measure rotator cuff muscle degeneration, and retrospectively analyzed 107 preoperative shoulder CT scans of patients with primary osteoarthritis. On a standardized sagittal-oblique CT slice perpendicular to the scapular axis, two observers measured the cross-sectional areas of residual rotator cuff muscle tissues, normalized by the estimated area of healthy muscles. Muscle degeneration was quantified in a semi-automated manner, and divided into atrophy and fatty infiltration. <b>Scapulohumeral</b> subluxation was determined in 3 D as {{the distance between the}} humeral head center and the glenoid surface center, projected on the same CT slice, and normalized by the humeral head radius. We tested all potential correlations between muscle degeneration and <b>scapulohumeral</b> subluxation. Muscle degeneration, primarily due to atrophy, predominated in the supraspinatus; it varied from 0. 8 % to 88. 8 %. <b>Scapulohumeral</b> subluxation varied from 2. 5 % to 72. 9 %, and was mainly in a posterior and postero-superior orientation. There was a significant but weak correlation between the amount of subluxation and both supraspinatus (R= 0. 207, P= 0. 032) and infraspinatus (R= 0. 225, P= 0. 020) degeneration. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of muscle degeneration measurements were both excellent (ICCs range= 0. 955 - 0. 987 and 0. 971 - 0. 988, respectively). This new semi-automated CT method allows to quantitatively and reproducibly measure rotator cuff muscle degeneration in shoulders with primary osteoarthritis. Muscle degeneration is weakly correlated with <b>scapulohumeral</b> subluxation in patients planned for anatomical TSA. Level IV. Diagnostic retrospective study...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{develop a}} better {{understanding}} of <b>scapulohumeral</b> rhythm during scapular plane shoulder elevation. METHODS: Thirteen healthy, college-aged subjects participated in this study. Subjects were free from any upper extremity, neck or back pathology. A modified digital inclinometer was utilized to measure scapular upward rotation of the subject&#x 2019;s dominant shoulder. Upward rotation was measured statically as subjects performed clinically relevant amounts of shoulder elevation in the scapular plane. Testing order was randomized by arm position. Scapular upward rotation was assessed over the entire arc of motion and over a series of increments. The percent contributions to shoulder elevation for the scapula and glenohumeral joint were calculated. <b>Scapulohumeral</b> rhythm was assessed and represented the ratio of glenohumeral motion to scapulothoracic motion (glenohumeral elevation: scapular upward rotation). A one-way ANOVA was used to compare scapular upward rotation between elevation increments. RESULTS: <b>Scapulohumeral</b> rhythm for the entire arc of shoulder elevation was equal to a ratio of 2. 34 : 1 and ranged from 40. 01 : 1 to 0. 90 : 1 when assessed across the different increments of humeral elevation. Total scapular motion increased over the arc of shoulder elevation. The scapula contributed 2. 53 % of total motion for the first 30 degrees of shoulder elevation, between 20. 87 % and 37. 53 % for 30 o- 90 o of shoulder elevation, and 52. 73 % for 90 o- 120 o of shoulder elevation. Statistically significant differences in scapular upward rotation were identified across the shoulder elevation increments [F(3, 48) = 12. 63, P = 0. 0001]. CONCLUSION: Clinically, we must recognize the usefulness of the inclinometer in documenting the variable nature of <b>scapulohumeral</b> rhythm in healthy and injured shoulders...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} effect of digital acupoint pressure combined with hot ironing of Zhuang {{medicine in the}} therapy of <b>scapulohumeral</b> periarthritis. Methods: 160 patients with <b>scapulohumeral</b> periarthritis were randomly divided into the treatment group and control group with 80 patients in each group. The treatment group was treated with digital acupoint pressure combined with hot ironing of Zhuang medicine. The control group was treated with intermediate frequency therapy apparatus. All the treatments were given once a day for 4 weeks, Then the effective rate {{as well as the}} scores of shoulder pain and joint inflammation,were calculated. Results: The shoulder pain score of the treatment group was 3. 49 ± 0. 98, while that of control group was 5. 33 ± 1. 26 (P < 0. 05). The shoulder joint inflammation score in the treatment group was higher than that of the control group (73. 24 ± 7. 20 vs 60. 71 ± 10. 46, P < 0. 05). these results suggested that 4 weeks of treatments improved the shoulder function. Moreover, the effective rate of the treatment group was higher than that of the control group (86. 25 % vs 63. 75 %). Conclusion: Digital acupoint pressure combined with hot ironing in Zhuang medicine could relieve joint pain of patients with <b>scapulohumeral</b> periarthritis and improve their shoulder mobility...|$|E
40|$|Three {{horses that}} were {{presented}} with supraglenoid tubercle fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation using distal femoral locking plates (DFLP). Placing the DFLP caudal to the scapular spine {{in order to preserve}} the suprascapular nerve led to a stable fixation, however, it resulted in infraspinatus muscle atrophy and mild <b>scapulohumeral</b> joint instability (case 1). Placing the DFLP cranial to the scapular spine and under the suprascapular nerve resulted in a stable fixation, however, it resulted in severe atrophy of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles and <b>scapulohumeral</b> joint instability (case 2). Placing the DFLP cranial to the scapular spine and slightly overbending it at the suprascapular nerve passage site resulted in the best outcome (case 3). Only a mild degree of supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle atrophy was apparent, which resolved quickly and with no effect on <b>scapulohumeral</b> joint stability. In all cases, fixation of supraglenoid tubercle fractures using DFLP in slightly different techniques led to stable fixations with good long-term outcome. One case suffered from a mild incisional infection and plates were removed in two horses. Placement of the DFLP cranial to the scapular spine and slightly overbending it at the suprascapular nerve passage prevented major nerve damage. Further cases investigating the degree of muscle atrophy following the use of the DFLP placed in the above-described technique are justified to improve patient outcom...|$|E

30|$|Overhead {{translation}} of the glenohumeral joint requires a balance activity of scapular-stabilizing muscle to maintain the so-called <b>scapulohumeral</b> rhythm, that is, the gliding motion of the anterior surface of the scapula on the posterolateral surface of the thoracic cage [1]. The fatigue of the scapular stabilizer muscles alters <b>scapulohumeral</b> rhythm and induces a decrease of the rotator cuff (RC) strength. Kibler et al. [2] explored the relationship between apparent supraspinatus weakness and scapular dyskinesis, while Smith et al. [3] reported {{the effect of the}} scapula repositioning on isometric shoulder elevation strength. In our previous paper [4] we described a practical test to assess infraspinatus strength with the scapula retracted (infraspinatus scapula retraction test, ISRT) versus infraspinatus strength with the scapula free (infraspinatus strength test, IST) in professional volleyball players with scapular dyskinesis. In the current study we analyzed the interobserver and intraobserver realibility of IST and ISRT in 29 overhead athletes with altered scapular kinesis, before and after 6  months of rehabilitation.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} shoulder complex kinematics {{in persons}} with chronic upper extremity (UE) impairments due to stroke and determine if kinematics predicts motor function {{based on the}} Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA). Method: Sixteen stroke survivors with chronic UE impairments (age range = 46 – 80 years, male = 8, female = 8, mean (SD) 66 (40) months post-stroke) performed the UE portion of the FMA with the shoulder/ elbow subscale (FM_se) documented. Three-dimensional kinematics of the shoulder complex was collected with the Motion Monitor ™ (Innsport, Chicago, IL, USA). Participants performed three repetitions of arm elevation in the frontal, sagittal and self-selected planes. The third repetition was analyzed. Scapular and humeral kinematics were calculated in the self-selected plane. <b>Scapulohumeral</b> rhythm was analyzed at peak elevation. Backward stepwise regression analysis predicted kinematic contributions to the FM_se. Results: Mean (SD) FM_se score was 25. 3 1 (10. 9). Peak humeral elevation ranged from 45. 6 ° to 129. 2 ° (median 106. 7 °). <b>Scapulohumeral</b> rhythm was 4. 1 : 1 when humeral elevation ranged from 45 ° to 50 °, 1. 5 : 1 from 80 ° to 95 ° and 2. 1 : 1 from 105 ° to 130 °. Humeral elevation, scapular upward rotation and scapular internal rotation predicted 65. 4 % of FM_se score variability. Conclusion: Persons with chronic UE impairments from stroke demonstrated reduced peak elevation and altered <b>scapulohumeral</b> rhythm. Three predictors of the FM_se were humeral elevation, scapular upward rotation and scapular internal rotation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Eccentric loading due to humeral {{translation}} {{is associated with}} worse clinical outcomes in hemiarthroplasty and total shoulder arthroplasty. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the 3 -dimensional relationship of the humeral head to the scapula (<b>scapulohumeral</b> relationship) in nonpathologic shoulders and in shoulders with primary osteoarthritis. Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional reconstructions of computed tomography scans of 151 nonpathologic shoulders (control group) and 110 shoulders with primary glenohumeral arthritis (OA group) were analyzed by measuring the anterior-posterior, inferior-superior, and medial-lateral position of the humeral head in relation to the scapula. Shoulders were classified as centered (type A) or posteriorly subluxed (type B) according to the Walch classification of glenoid morphology. Reproducibility and differences in <b>scapulohumeral</b> relationship were statistically analyzed. Results: The <b>scapulohumeral</b> relationship could be determined reliably: the intraclass correlation coefficient ranged between 0. 780 and 0. 978; the typical error of measurement ranged between 2. 4 % and 5. 0 %. Both type A and type B shoulders showed significant posterior translation of the humeral head (P <. 001). Type B shoulders had significantly more posterior translation than type A shoulders (P <. 001). A tendency of inferior translation was noted, although with only marginal statistical significance (P =. 051). In each morphology class, a medial deviation of the humeral head, representing a reduced glenohumeral distance, was measured (P <. 001). Conclusions: The main characteristics of primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis are posterior humeral head translation relative to the scapula, reduced glenohumeral distance, and a tendency toward inferior humeral head translation in both type A and type B shoulders...|$|E
40|$|Background In recent years, {{there has}} been a great {{interest}} in analyzing upper-limb kinematics in order to investigate <b>scapulohumeral</b> rhythm, as its alteration has been associated with shoulder joint complex injuries. The use of inertial sensors is presented as a convenient and portable analysis method for studying kinematics in terms of angular mobility and linear acceleration. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze upper-limbs kinematics in the three anatomical axes, obtained by inertial sensors. Results Descriptive graphics of analytical tasks performed were obtained. The main difference in mobility between the scapula and humerus was found in pitch axis for abduction (X &#x 00 AF; = 107. 6 °, SD = 9. 3 °) and flexion (X &#x 00 AF; = 113. 1 °, SD = 9. 3 °). Conclusion The use of inertial sensors for human kinematics analysis is favorable. Although this study identified movement patterns, and supports inertial sensors as a useful device to analyze upper-limb kinematics, further studies with subjects with shoulder pathology to establish differences in movement patterns and <b>scapulohumeral</b> rhythm between healthy and pathological shoulders should be carried out...|$|E

The participants performed isometric shoulder elevation from a neutral position to approximately 150 degrees of elevation in the scapular plane in intervals of approximately 30 degrees during unloaded and loaded conditions. Shoulder kinematic data were obtained with videogrammetry. During shoulder elevation, the scapula rotated upwardly and externally, and tilted posteriorly. The addition of an external load did not affect 3 D scapular orientation, scapular angular displacement, or <b>scapulohumeral</b> rhythm throughout shoulder elevation (P >. 05). In clinical practice, clinicians should expect to observe upward and external rotation and posterior tilt of the scapula during their assessments of shoulder elevation.
