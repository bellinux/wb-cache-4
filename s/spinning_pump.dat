This evaluation shows that the steady-state population of the quantum dot remains unchanged by the precession owing to the rotational symmetry about the axis of precession.

This phenomenon, known as <b>spin</b> <b>pumping,</b> is manifested {{by an increase in}} the resonance linewidth (Δ H), and the closely related Gilbert damping. Another effect of this transfer of spin currents is a dynamical and long-range coupling that can drive two magnetic layers into a collective precession when their FMR frequencies coincide. A collective behavior is also found in magnetic trilayers with interlayer exchange coupling (IEC). In this study we investigate the interplay between IEC and <b>spin</b> <b>pumping,</b> using Co/Cu/Py pseudo-spin values.
