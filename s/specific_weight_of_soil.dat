A research on napier grass in agroforestry system conducted {{to find out}} soil fertility, growth, production, and quality of forage in agroforestry system in headwaters of Tuntang watershed. This research used factorial plan 2 x 2 which was repeated five times. The first factor was agroforestry system (AFS- 1 and AFS- 2) and the second factor was defoliation in wet and dry season.

In order to study the effect of the tea bushes on soil physics in forest areas turned in low land Siahkal Forests, Series 3 Toshi in the Siahkal forests area in Gilan. Soil sampling is done by using systematic sampling method, and the depth of 0 to 30 cm. In total, 40 soil samples (20 samples for each region), to measure parameters of the soil were sampled and were transported to the laboratory. After normalization of the data, by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, using the software SPSS 18, to study and compare data related to the parameters studied of soil in two areas of degraded forest and tea garden, Non-paired t-test was used. The results showed that, in both two areas of degraded forest and tea garden, soil type was clay loam, and the percentage of clay and sand in the forest is more than tea gardens and the percentage of silt in the forest is less than tea gardens. Apparent <b>specific</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> in forest areas is more than tea garden areas and, conversely, the average actual specific weight, porosity in the tea gardens is more than the forest area, which represents an increase in soil quality due to conversion of forest land to the tea garden in the forest areas destroyed in downstream areas of forests in this region...|$|E
40|$|The diverse {{character}} of fluvial sediments makes {{the choice of}} laboratory analysis somewhat arbitrary and the processing of sediment samples difficult. This report presents some theories and methods used by the Water Resources Division for analysis of fluvial sediments to determine the concentration of suspended sediments samples and the particle-size distribution of both suspended-sediment and bed-material samples. Other analyses related to these determinations may include particle shape, mineral content, and specific gravity, the organic matter and dissolved solids of samples, and the <b>specific</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils.</b> The merits and techniques of both the evaporation and filtration methods for concentration analysis are discussed. Methods used for particle-size analysis of suspended-sediment samples may include the sievepipet, the VA tube-pipet, or the BW tube-VA imbe depending on the equipment available, the concentration and approximate size of sediment in the sample, and the settling medium used. The choice of method for most bed-material samples is usually limited to procedures suitable for sand or to some type of visual analysis for large sizes. Several tested forms are presented to help insure a well-ordered system in the laboratory to handle the samples, to help determine the kind of analysis required for each, to conduct the required processes, and {{to assist in the}} required computations.

50|$|The {{buoyancy}} {{effects of}} water {{have a large}} impact on certain soil properties, such as the effective stress present {{at any point in}} a soil medium. Consider an arbitrary point five meters below the ground surface. In dry soil, particles at this point experience a total overhead stress equal to the depth underground (5 meters), multiplied by the <b>specific</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the <b>soil.</b> However, when the local water table height is within said five meters, the total stress felt five meters below surface is decreased by the product of the height of the water table in to the five meter area, and the <b>specific</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> water, 9.81 kN/m^3.
