2500|$|... at 2700rpm, Minimum {{fuel grade}} 91/96 or 100LL avgas, {{compression}} ratio 8.50:1. Same as B1A except with counter-clockwise engine rotation and reverse rotation of accessories. It uses a modified <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> gear, crankshaft, cam shaft, accessory housing and oil pump body. This engine is usually paired with an IO-320-B1A on a twin-engined aircraft.|$|E
50|$|A <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> gear, {{sometimes}} called a <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> or ring gear, is a {{medium carbon steel}} ring with teeth that is fitted {{on the periphery of}} a flexplate or flywheel of an internal combustion engine, mostly for automotive or aircraft applications. The teeth of the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> are driven by the smaller gear (the pinion) of the starter motor. The primary function of the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> is to transfer torque from the starter motor pinion to the flywheel or flexplate to rotate the engine to begin the cycle.|$|E
50|$|Engines with manual {{transmission}} {{usually have a}} heavy flywheel, typically 5 to 10 kg of cast iron, with the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> gear shrunk onto the outside. This is done by heating the ring to around 200 Â°C to expand the ring which is then placed onto the flywheel, often held in firmly against a location shoulder until cool. The interference fit renders the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> firmly attached to the flywheel. Engines with automatic transmissions instead have a pressed steel plate with the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> gear usually welded onto {{the outside of the}} plate.|$|E
50|$|The {{day before}} the race, a {{ceremonial}} drivers meeting is held at the track, which {{is open to the}} public, and is popularly attended. This tradition dates back many decades. During the meeting, the 33 starting drivers are presented with their <b>starter's</b> <b>ring</b> and various awards and trophies are handed out (such as trophies from the previous year's race, qualifying awards, lifetime achievement awards, etc.) The drivers are usually seated on a platform situated in the eleven rows of three, and numerous other celebrities and special guests may be honored or give remarks. Rules clarifications, instructions for the race, and other pertinent information is also discussed in the open forum. Drivers who can not attend due to scheduling conflicts (e.g., participating in another race) will usually have another team member or family member participate on their behalf.|$|R
25|$|The WRIM is used {{primarily}} {{to start a}} high inertia load or a load that requires a very high starting torque across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip <b>ring</b> <b>starter,</b> the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current from zero speed to full speed. This type of motor also offers controllable speed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> gear is most {{commonly}} made by forming {{a length of}} square or rectangular steel bar into a circle and welding the ends together. There then follow various operations such as normalising (to remove stresses and improve the properties in the weld area), turning, generating the teeth by gear hobbing and finally a heat-treatment operation(s). The teeth of the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> need to be hardened {{in order to increase}} their strength and resist wear. The normal hardness at pitch circle diameter is 45-55 HRC. The body of the ring is generally left untreated which gives some ductility for shrinking onto a flywheel or welding to a flexplate.|$|E
50|$|Hay Automobiltechnik {{based in}} Bockenau, Germany, is an {{automotive}} corporation from Germany {{which is the}} largest European producer of flywheels, hot rolled seamless rings and final drive gears and crown wheels for differential gears. The company is also the second largest European producer of <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> gears with 6 million parts per year.|$|E
5000|$|... at 2700 rpm, Minimum {{fuel grade}} 91/96 or 100LL avgas, {{compression}} ratio 8.50:1. Same as B1A except with counter-clockwise engine rotation and reverse rotation of accessories. It uses a modified <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> gear, crankshaft, cam shaft, accessory housing and oil pump body. This engine is usually paired with an IO-320-B1A on a twin-engined aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Shotgun {{starters}} {{are composed}} of a breech, into which the cartridge is inserted, which {{is connected to the}} motor by a short steel pipe, which acts like a gun barrel. The blank cartridge fits into the breech, and is triggered either electrically or mechanically. When the aircraft's ignition is turned on and the cartridge is fired, high-velocity, high-pressure gas (~ at ~600 ft/s) shoots down the pipe, forcing the motor to spin and engage the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> gear on the engine, which is attached to the crankshaft.|$|E
5000|$|The {{electric}} starter motor or cranking motor {{is the most}} common type used on gasoline engines and small diesel engines. The modern starter motor is either a permanent-magnet or a series-parallel wound direct current electric motor with a starter solenoid (similar to a relay) mounted on it. When DC power from the starting battery is applied to the solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch (the [...] "ignition switch"), the solenoid engages a lever that pushes out the drive pinion on the starter driveshaft and meshes the pinion with the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> gear on the flywheel of the engine.|$|E
50|$|Shotgun {{starters}} {{had several}} advantages over other starting systems in {{use at the}} time. Electric starters required large, heavy, and often troublesome batteries to be carried on board, or external charging equipment had to be located at every place where the vehicle was anticipated to operate. Inertia starters used a heavy wheel, usually made of brass, which was spun by a hand crank or electric motor, causing the spinning wheel to engage the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> gear. The Coffman system was more lightweight and compact than inertial starters or internal batteries, {{and it did not}} require any special auxiliary equipment, an important feature when operating in remote areas.|$|E
5000|$|Corvair Powerglide is a fully {{automatic}}, two-speed, rwd aluminum-cased {{automatic transmission}} mounted {{directly to the}} forward face of the cast iron differential housing. It uses a three-element, welded assembly 10 in diameter torque converter mounted remotely on the rear face of the differential, (that also incorporates the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> gear, and a centrifugal fan baffle for cooling, via slots in the engine bellhousing) and is driven directly from the engine crankshaft by a flexplate inside the engine bellhousing. The selector quadrant is arranged R-N-D-L, or Reverse, Neutral, Drive and Low, with no [...] "Park" [...] (except in Pontiac's 1963 version, redesigned to handle the increased torque of a new V8 engine in Tempest and LeMans, added {{by means of a}} separate lever). Range selection is via dash-mounted selector lever operating a sheathed cable that moves a spool valve range selector in the transmission valve body.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn general {{technical}} applications, truck {{heavy duty}} engine flywheel <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> gears teeth is conventionally induction {{hardened and tempered}} {{in order to meet}} metallurgical aspects on specification. Especially for large sectioned <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> gears (in this case diameter of the gear is 470 mm) the critical issue is to maintain a stable hardness distribution on gear cross sections. These hardness variations in process could yield to: 1. High scrap costs due to out of specification parts. 2. Increase in tact time in process, decrease in labor efficiency due to scrap rate and excessive hardness measurements. 3. Potential risk of failure on engine in low mileages. 4. 100 % hardness measurements in ongoing process which leads to time and cost waste. This technical paper summarizes the case study conducted for truck flywheel <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> gears with diameter of 470 mm in order to reduce hardness variation by optimization of induction hardening and tempering processes...|$|E
