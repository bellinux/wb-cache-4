Comparing the value added of spillover effects, however, showed that the spillover effect of the eastern provinces was insignificant. The primary reason for this effect is that although the value added of other provinces contributed by the <b>export</b> <b>spillover</b> effects of the eastern provinces was greater, China’s economy, especially the manufacturing industry, is concentrated in eastern provinces with strong agglomeration effects and supporting capacity. Therefore, the production of the products exported from eastern provinces is mainly completed in the local region, which contributes greatly to the eastern provinces’ economies but has a smaller spillover effect on other provinces.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{propose a}} {{theoretical}} model analyzing {{the impact of}} FDI on exports from the host country. Using the framework of monopolistic competition with heterogenous firms, I show that the entry of highly efficient MNEs increases competition in the export market, which leads to crowding-out of domestic exporters. As a result, even though overall efficiency of the industry increases, exports by this industry may decrease. Further on, I add into my model a potential spillover effect that FDI can induce by lowering costs associated to export activities for all firms. I show that in such situation, the increased efficiency {{is more likely to}} outweigh the negative competition effect, resulting in larger exports from the host country.
