The first chapter describes solidification of cast alloys. The second chapter {{deals with the}} designing of risers. The third chapter is focused on the types of risers. The fourth chapter describes ways of intensification of risers and chemical composition of exothermic and <b>insulating</b> <b>mixtures</b> for production of riser sleeves.

40|$|With local density {{approximation}} + Hubbard U (LDA+U) calculations, we {{show that}} the ferromagnetic (FM) insulating state observed in tensile-strained LaCoO_ 3 epitaxial thin films is most likely a mixture of low-spin (LS) and high-spin (HS) Co, namely, a HS/LS mixture state. Compared with other FM states, including the intermediate-spin (IS) state (metallic within LDA+U), which consists of IS Co only, and the <b>insulating</b> IS/LS <b>mixture</b> state, the HS/LS state is the most favorable one. The FM order in HS/LS state is stabilized via the superexchange interactions between adjacent LS and HS Co. We also show that Co spin state can be identified by measuring the electric field gradient (EFG) at Co nucleus via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy...|$|R
50|$|Batt fiberglass, {{blown in}} cellulose, or an <b>insulated</b> sawdust <b>mixture</b> are also {{insulators}} in cordwood walls. Rob Roy {{has found that}} a mixture of only vermiculite and sawdust, soaked in water overnight, results in an R value of 2.1- 2.5 per in. In a 16” wall this translates to an R value of 11-16. The use of cellulose (with an R value up to 3.7 per in.) can equalize the overall R value {{to that of a}} 2 x 6 stud frame with fiberglas insulation. Other materials like polystyrene or packaging peanuts have been economically used, and provide a purposeful use of recycled materials. A wall consisting of merely cordwood and mortar does not usually provide sufficient insulation for comfortable living in snowy regions, unless it is of the highly insulative Throughwall type.|$|R
40|$|A {{direct route}} to silica-polypyrrole {{core-shell}} nanoparticles {{has been used}} to design new nanocomposites, in which the conducting part is then wrapped by an external silica shell in order to have finally neutral nanoparticles. The nanocomposites are characterized by TEM, spectroscopy, electrochemistry and thermal gravimetric analysis, demonstrating that the external <b>silica</b> shell actually <b>insulates</b> the conjugated polymer from the outer medium. Finally the electrorheological properties of these nanocomposites are checked in a dielectrophoretic device in which the motion of the particles induced by an external electric field can be used to monitor a switch of the light transmission properties...|$|R

40|$|The {{inner surface}} of fused silica {{capillaries}} has been {{coated with a}} dense/homogeneous coating of commercial multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) using a stable ink as deposit precursor. Solubilization of the MWCNTs was achieved in water/ethanol/dimethylformamide {{by the action of}} a surfactant which can switch between a neutral or an ionic form depending on the pH of the medium, which thus becomes the driving force for the entire deposition process. Careful control of the experimental conditions have allowed us to selectively deposit CNTs on the inner surface of <b>insulating</b> <b>silica</b> capillaries by a simple, reproducible, and easily adaptable method...|$|R
40|$|A thin, {{insulating}} layer with high electrical resistivity {{is vital to}} achieving high performance of powder magnetic cores. Using layer-by-layer deposition of silica nanosheets or colloidal <b>silica</b> over <b>insulating</b> layers composed of strontium phosphate and boron oxide, we succeeded in fabricating {{insulating layer}}s with high electrical resistivity on iron powder particles, which were subsequently used to prepare toroidal cores. The compact density of these cores decreased after coating with colloidal silica due to the substantial increase in the volume, causing the magnetic flux density to deteriorate. Coating with silica nanosheets, on the other hand, resulted in a higher electrical resistivity and a good balance between high magnetic flux density and low iron loss due to the thinner silica layers. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that {{the thickness of the}} colloidal silica coating was about 700 nm, while that of the silica nanosheet coating was 30 nm. There was one drawback to using silica nanosheets, namely a deterioration in the core mechanical strength. Nevertheless, the silica nanosheet coating resulted in nanoscale-thick silica layers that are favorable for enhancing the electrical resistivity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBroadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS) and Ellipsometry are {{combined}} {{to study the}} glassy dynamics of nanometric layers (>= 5 nm) of polystyrene. For the former, two types of sample arrangement are applied, that is, the conventional method where evaporated metal electrodes are used and a novel technique in which <b>insulating</b> <b>silica</b> nanostructures serve as spacers between highly conducting doped silicon counter electrodes. Within {{the limits of the}} experimental accuracy (+/- 2 K) both approaches, BDS and Ellipsometry, deliver the coinciding result that - compared to the bulk - the glassy dynamics is not shifted. Furthermore the dielectric measurements do not indicate any broadening of the relaxation time distribution function, independent of the sample geometry employed...|$|R
40|$|The {{electromechanical}} {{behavior of}} a gas-fluidized bed of <b>insulating</b> <b>silica</b> nanoparticles is investigated. When fluidized by gas, these nanoparticles form highly porous agglomerates of size {{of the order of}} hundreds of microns, which gives rise to a nonbubbling fluidization regime. Bed expansion is enhanced by an imposed alternating electric field for oscillation frequencies in the range between tens and hundreds of hertzs and field strengths of about 1 kVcm. Nanoparticle agglomerates are naturally charged and experience forced oscillations that cause an increase of the gas flow shear on their surface. As a consequence, the agglomerate size is expected to decrease, which can explain the observed behavior. A model based on the balance between attractive and flow shear forces is presented that accounts for agglomerate size reduction as the strength of the field is increased...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} aerogel–aerogel composites {{to develop}} new materials for thermal insulation applications with reduced fragility and without release of dust. Two different kinds of highly <b>insulating</b> <b>silica</b> aerogels (SiO 2) were embedded into a cellulosic aerogel: a high-density (0. 25 g/cm 3) tetramethylorthosilicate (TMOS) based and a low-density (0. 15 g/cm 3) waterglass based hydrophilic granular silica aerogel which {{are added to the}} salt hydrate melt of 59 wt. % calcium thiocyanate and 2 or 3 wt. % of cellulose during the synthesis of a cellulosic aerogel. The silica aerogel species show a different behavior regarding the interaction with the cellulose network in the composite examined by scanning electron microscopy. With the synthesis method we were able to produce non-fragile aerogel–aerogel composites and a strong stiffening effect regarding Young’s modulus was achieved compared to pure aerogels.

40|$|Granulated {{foam glass}} is an {{effective}} insulation material based on natural raw and technogenic materials. Its manufacture on the technology of low temperature foaming, excluding premelting of glass {{or the use of}} scrap and waste glass, comprises the steps of drying and grinding of tripoli of Potaninsk deposit (Chelyabinsk region). After that, we should to mix the crushing product with a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution in the intensive mixer granulator for forming of granulated material, its drying at temperature of 200 ºC and foaming at temperature of 830 - 850 ºC. The choice of tripoli as a <b>silica</b> component for <b>insulating</b> filling agents on the technology of low temperature foaming is caused by a high content of active silica in the rock, the constancy of the composition and porous structure. The quality (density, strength and thermal conductivity characteristics) of the developed heat insulating crystalline granulated material is comparable to the best foreign models...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOrdered {{mesoporous}} materials {{prepared by}} the template route have attracted increasing interest from the electrochemists community due to their plenty of unique properties and functionalities that can be effectively exploited in electrochemical devices. This review will cover the whole field of the intersection between electrochemistry and ordered mesoporous materials. The latter are either electronically <b>insulating</b> (<b>silica</b> and some other metal oxides, as well as silica-based organic-inorganic hybrid materials), semiconducting (metal oxides), or conducting (metals, carbons). The three main intersection areas are: (1) the development/use of electrochemical methods to characterize the properties of mesoporous materials (i. e., charge and mass transfer processes); (2) the generation of mesostructured solids by electro-assisted deposition using appropriate templates; and (3) the application of these novel materials for electrochemical purposes.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{successfully}} integrated a thermally <b>insulating</b> <b>silica</b> aerogel thin film {{into a new}} uncooled monolithic thin film infrared (IR) imaging device. Compared to other technologies (bulk ceramic and microbridge), use of an aerogel layer provides superior thermal isolation of the pyroelectric imaging element from the relatively massive heat sinking integrated circuit. This results in significantly higher thermal and temporal resolutions. They have calculated noise equivalent temperature differences of 0. 04 [...] 0. 10 C {{from a variety of}} Pb{sub x}Zr{sub y}Ti{sub 1 {minus}y}O{sub 3 } (PZT) and Pb{sub x}La{sub 1 {minus}x}Zr{sub y}Ti{sub 1 {minus}y}O{sub 3 } (PLZT) pyroelectric imaging elements in monolithic structures. In addition, use of aerogels results in an easier, less expensive fabrication process and a more robust device. Fabrication of these monolithic devices entails sol-gel deposition of the aerogel, sputter deposition of the electrodes, and solution chemistry deposition of the pyroelectric imaging elements. Uniform pyroelectric response is achieved across the device by use of appropriate planarization techniques. These deposition and planarization techniques are described. Characterization of the individual layers and monolithic structure using scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and Byer-Roundy techniques also is discussed...|$|R

Suitability of alkali-containing-clay, low-alkali fireclay, pore-making paper waste and sawdust in the products was evaluated. Prepared slurry mixtures were shaped, dried and fired. Highly porous anorthite ceramics from the mixtures with up to 30 % sawdust addition were successfully produced. Physical properties such as bulk density, apparent porosity, percent linear change were investigated {{as well as the}} mechanical strengths and thermal conductivity values of the samples. Thermal conductivities of the samples produced from fireclay and recycled paper waste decreased from 0. 25 W/mK (1. 12 g/cm 3) to 0. 13 W/mK (0. 64 g/cm 3) with decreasing density. Samples were stable at high temperatures up to 1100 °C, and their cold strength was sufficiently high.

40|$|Attempts {{were made}} to produce directionally solidified, {{specifically}} grain aligned Al- 6 wt pct Ni eutectic alloy using a laboratory scale ESR unit. For this purpose sand cast alloy electrodes were electroslag remelted under different mold conditions. The grain structure of the ingots obtained from these meltings showed that <b>insulated</b> <b>silica</b> molds gave the best vertical alignment of grains {{along the length of}} the ingot. The NiAl 3 fibers within the grains tended to fan out and there was only a preferred alignment of fibers along the growth direction under the conditions of our experiments. The ESR parameters most suitable for vertical alignment of eutectic grains have been identified. In some electroslag remelting trials ingots were grown on a seed ingot. This resulted in a fewer vertical grains compared to the case when no seed ingot was used. The sand cast specimen of the eutectic exhibited a maximum tensile strength of around 88. 2 MN/m 2 (9. 0 kg/mm 2) whereas conventional ESR using water cooled mold gave strength value of 98. 0 MN/m 2 (10 kg/mm 2). The directionally solidified ESR material showed longitudinal tensile strength as high as 213. 7 MN/m 2 (21. 8 kg/mm 2) which could be further increased to 220. 6 MN/m 2 (22. 5 kg/mm 2) by using the seed ingot. The average growth rate was varied between 5 to 25 mm/min during electroslag remelting in this study. The flow stresses, tangent modulus and ultimate tensile strength of directionally solidified eutectic increased with increasing growth rates...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{an effort}} to develop {{cost-effective}} ferritic stainless steel-based interconnects for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks, both bare and spinel coated AISI 441 were studied in terms of metallurgical characteristics, oxidation behavior, and electrical performance. The conventional melt metallurgy used for the bulk alloy fabrication leads to significant processing cost reduction and the alloy chemistry with the presence of minor alloying additions of Nb and Ti facilitate the strengthening by precipitation and formation of Laves phase both inside grains and along grain boundaries during exposure in the intermediate SOFC operating temperature range. The Laves phase formed along the grain boundaries also ties up Si and prevents the formation of an <b>insulating</b> <b>silica</b> layer at the scale/metal interface during prolonged exposure. The substantial increase in ASR during long term oxidation due to oxide scale growth suggested the need for a conductive protection layer, which could also minimize Cr evaporation. In particular, Mn 1. 5 Co 1. 5 O 4 based surface coatings on planar coupons drastically improved the electrical performance of the 441, yielding stable ASR values at 800 ºC for over 5, 000 hours. Ce-modified spinel coatings retained the advantages of the unmodified spinel coatings, and also appeared to alter the scale growth behavior beneath the coating, leading to a more adherent scale. The spinel protection layers appeared also to improve the surface stability of 441 against the anomalous oxidation that has been observed for ferritic stainless steels exposed to dual atmosphere conditions similar to SOFC interconnect environments. Hence, it is anticipated that, compared to unmodified spinel coatings, the Ce-modified coatings may lead to superior structural stability and electrical performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} conduction {{properties of}} ruthenium oxide nanocables are of high interest. These cables {{can be built}} as thin shells of RuO 2 surrounding an inner solid nanowire of a dielectric <b>insulating</b> <b>silica</b> material. With this motivation we have investigated the structural, electronic and transport properties of RuO 2 nanotubes using the density functional formalism, and applying many-body corrections to the electronic band structure. The structures obtained for the thinnest nanotubes are of the rutile type. The structures of nanotubes with larger diameters deviate from the rutile structure and have in common the formation of dimerized Ru-Ru rows along the axial direction. The cohesive energy shows an oscillating behavior {{as a function of}} the tube diameter. With the exception of the thinnest nanotubes, there is a correlation such that the electronic band structures of tubes with high cohesive energies show small gaps at the Fermi energy, whereas the less stable nanotubes exhibit metallic behavior, with bands crossing the Fermi surface. The electronic conductance of nanotubes of finite length connected to gold electrodes has been calculated using a Green-function formalism, and correlations have been established between the electronic band structure and the conductance at zero bias.

40|$|During {{the past}} 50 years, {{technological}} innovation {{has changed the}} design approach to the infinitesimal dimensions of the matter. An unprecedented revolution has already taken place and rewrote some of {{the pages of the}} building history. The materials and technologies are invisible to eye but allow to design exceptional levels of performance of many building components. In this way manifests itself a new level of design. The real change modifies the physical and chemical structure of materials and building components. As result we obtain a higher degree of functionalization that responds to outstanding performances. Materials are used at the micrometer and nanometer scale. The new materials can modify their status when the external stimuli from environment or human will change. So materials are defined active and technologies smart, because their performance are changing and interactive. Even the concrete meets innovation hidden in relation to project performance. This report relates to a number of new concretes, starting with the so-called ecological, since adding fly ash and silica fume. The micrometric particles these wastes from industry and the chemical nanometer action of the superplasticizer make self-compacting concrete. After advances in study of polymer chains (1976), synthetic fibers make a micrometer reinforcement so widespread as to contain the shrinkage, in the fiber-reinforced concretes. With the discovery of carbon nanotubes (1991) concretes are armed to the nanometer scale. Are more resistant to traction and have a higher ductility. In particular self-compacting concretes with carbon nanotubes have higher performances and ductile-brittle behavior {{in the early days of}} curing. Then there are the concrete with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide, with self-cleaning effect and antipollution, that are smart materials. Titanium dioxide (1967) is made active by light that determines the photocatalysis. It is also used in plasters and paints cement. It is also analyzed the <b>silica</b> airgel, lightweight <b>insulating</b> material (1931). It has a nanoporosity and is also translucent, so it takes in the cavity of windows panes. Last there are phase change materials, nanometric particles in capsules micrometer that enhance the inertia of lightweight components. They are smart materials because when it's hot the heat is absorbed and when it's cold is released. Mutable and interactive performances of these materials allow for life quality and environment respect, pursuing higher comfort level and savings and efficiency energy...|$|R
40|$|Core/shell {{nanorods}} {{based on}} a plasmonic gold nanorod core with a thin dielectric shell were designed, synthesized and characterized to demonstrate their potential in photovoltaics and cancer therapy applications. For solar cell applications, the light scattering properties of Au nanorods were combined with an electrically <b>insulating</b> <b>silica</b> (SiO 2) layer to form a core/shell architecture. The Au nanorod core was coated with a SiO 2 shell in order to isolate the conductive metal surface of the gold from the conductive photo-polymers in the active layers of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The aspect ratio of the Au nanorod core was spectrally tailored so that the peak extinction wavelength of the Au/SiO 2 core/shell nanorod coincided with wavelength regions in which the photovoltaic material absorbed poorly. Specifically, octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS) -functionalized Au/SiO 2 core/shell nanorods were spectrally tailored and incorporated into two OPV polymer systems: poly(3 -hexylthiophene) :[6, 6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (P 3 HT:PCB 60 M) and poly[2, 6 - 4, 8 -di(5 -ethylhexylthienyl) benzo[1, 2 -b; 3, 4 -b]dithiophene-alt- 5 -dibutyloctyl- 3, 6 -bis(5 -bromothiophen- 2 -yl) pyrrolo[3, 4 -c]pyrrole- 1, 4 -dione] (PBDTT-DPP:PC 60 BM). For the P 3 HT:PC 60 BM polymer with a band edge at ~ 670 nm, the incorporation of Au/SiO 2 core/shell nanospheres (radius = 20 nm) resulted in a 2. 7 % improvement in photon conversion efficiency (PCE). The incorporation of the core/shell nanorods (radius = 10 nm) with an aspect ratio (AR) ~ 2. 5 (extinction peak, ëpeak = 670 nm) resulted in a 7. 1 % improvement in PCE. For the PBDTT-DPP:PC 60 BM polymer with a band edge at ~ 830 nm, the incorporation of Au/SiO 2 core/shell nanospheres resulted in a 9. 2 % improvement, while that of core/shell nanorods (radius = 8 nm) of AR ~ 4 (extinction peak, ëpeak = 830 nm) resulted in a 14. 4 % improvement in PCE. The performance enhancements were corroborated by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. For cancer therapy applications, the strong light absorption properties of Au nanorods were combined with the upconverting light emission properties of rare earth doped-yttria (RE:Y 2 O 3) {{in order to create}} hybrid plasmonic/fluorescent core/shell nanorods for dual bio-imaging and photo-thermal therapy applications. Specifically, Au/SiO 2 /Yb:Er:Y 2 O 3 core/shell nanorods were synthesized, optically characterized and tested for photo-thermal therapy both in-vitro and in-vivo. The plasmonic/fluorescent Au/SiO 2 /Yb:Er:Y 2 O 3 core/shell nanorods have a unique optical signature when excited with 980 nm laser irradiation, exhibiting both the broadband photoluminescence characteristic of Au interband transitions and the sharp emission lines characteristic of the Er 3 + 4 F 9 / 2 -> 4 I 15 / 2 energy transition. The Au/SiO 2 /Yb:Er:Y 2 O 3 showed a nearly two fold increase in emission compared to SiO 2 /Yb:Er:Y 2 O 3 nanospheres at a wavelength of 655 nm (Er 3 + 4 F 9 / 2 -> 4 I 15 / 2 energy transition). Au/SiO 2 /Yb:Er:Y 2 O 3 core/shell nanorods were shown to exhibit photothermal properties upon 980 nm laser irradiation which reduced cell viability in cyto-toxicity assays and induced selective hyperthermia in breast cancer cells both in-vitro and in-vivo...|$|R
40|$|In many {{applications}} of high voltage engineering, electrical and thermal stresses increase {{due to an}} ongoing decrease of product dimensions. In particular, the electrical industry is interested in applying nanofluids in transformers {{to be able to}} decrease transformer size and weight. The requirement for nanofluids is to enhance the electrical insulation as well as the thermal conductivity of transformer oil. The focus of this thesis is to investigate how to improve the dielectric strength and thermal conductivity of mineral oil by introducing a low concentration of nanoparticles as well as to understand the possible mechanism behind the property changes. Stable dispersed nanoparticles are vital for the investigation of the properties of nanofluids. However, it can be a challenge to maintain the nano-meter size of nanoparticles due to the attractive force between nanoparticles, which can lead to the formation of agglomerations which eventually settle out of suspension. In this thesis, good and stable dispersed nanoparticles in mineral oil have been achieved by magnetic stirring and ultrasonic vibration at a relatively low concentration. The two types of nanofillers which were used to achieve stable dispersed nanofluids are silica and fullerene nanoparticles. The results of AC breakdown test results on nanofluids with up to 0. 02 wt. % silica and nanofluids with up to 0. 1 wt. % fullerene showed that both types of nanofluids exhibited enhanced breakdown strength compared with mineral oil. The enhancement increases with an increase of mass fraction. The effect is more significant at higher moisture content. The enhancement of the AC breakdown voltage due to silica nanoparticles is larger than for fullerene nanoparticles. Since <b>silica</b> is an <b>insulating</b> material and fullerene is a semi conductive material, the phenomena can't be explained by the theory of conductive nanoparticles acting as electron traps. Besides, moisture content {{plays an important role in}} the breakdown behaviour of mineral oil. So one possible explanation behind the enhanced AC breakdown voltage of silica nanofluids is that moisture is adsorbed on the surface of silica nanoparticles. However, fullerene is hydrophobic, therefore moisture adsorption can't be the reason for the enhanced breakdown strength of fullerene nanofluids. Partial discharge (PD) measurements gave more detailed information on the pre-breakdown phenomenon of dielectric nanofluids by recording the discharge pulse shape, inception voltage, total discharge magnitude and single discharge pulse amplitude. The PD results of mineral oil, 0. 01 wt. % silica and fullerene nanofluids showed that silica nanoparticles increase the inception voltage, and decrease both the total discharge magnitude and the pulse amplitude of mineral oil significantly. The effect due to fullerene nanoparticles is similar but less than the effect of silica nanoparticles. The possible explanation of this phenomenon is that organic acid is adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles. The increased inception voltage and decreased PD discharge magnitudes of silica and fullerene nanofluids can be due to the decreased acidity in the nanofluids. The larger effect of silica nanoparticles on the dielectric strength of mineral oil compared with fullerene nanoparticles can be a result of the combination of acid and moisture adsorption on the surface of the nanoparticles. The effect of silica and fullerene nanoparticles up to 0. 1 % mass fraction on the thermal conductivity and viscosity of mineral oil is negligible. This is mainly due to the low concentration and limitation of stability of nanofluids. The stability and possible harmful effects of nanoparticles on health and environment are also discussed in this thesis. Finally, it was concluded that the dielectric strength of mineral oil is improved by adding a low concentration of nanoparticles. The possible explanation for this achievement and recommendations for further research are also described. Electrical Power EngineeringElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
