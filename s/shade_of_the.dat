5|$|The two {{subspecies}} {{are similar}} in coloration, but differ in the <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap. The northern subspecies, living in Central Pacific Costa Rica, has a lighter cap than the southern subspecies, which lives in Panama and in parts of Costa Rica near Panama. The southern subspecies also has more yellowish limbs and underparts.|$|E
5|$|S.e.caesia, {{the most}} {{widespread}} of the western subspecies, has orange-buff underparts except for a white throat and cheeks. The other western forms mainly differ in the exact <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underparts, although some southeastern forms also show a white forehead and supercilium. S.e.sinensis and S.e.formosana, of China and Taiwan respectively, have buff underparts like the western races, but have buff, instead of white, throats.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} {{geographic}} variation in size. The main differences are {{the presence or absence}} of a whitish partial collar at the base of the nape, the variations in the <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nape and the tone of the underparts. Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions and humid climates, and paler elsewhere. However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also during the months before moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.|$|E

5|$|The crag martins {{are four}} species of small {{passerine}} {{birds in the}} genus Ptyonoprogne of the swallow family. They are the Eurasian crag martin (P.rupestris), the pale crag martin (P.obsoleta), the rock martin (P.fuligula) and the dusky crag martin (P.concolor). They {{are closely related to}} each other, and have formerly sometimes been considered to be one species. They are closely related to the Hirundo barn swallows and are placed in that genus by some authorities. These are small swallows with brown upperparts, paler underparts without a breast band, and a square tail with white patches. They can be distinguished from each other on size, the colour <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upperparts and underparts, and minor plumage details like throat colour. They resemble the sand martin, but are darker below, and lack a breast band.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{also used}} for tooth whitening. It {{can be found in}} most whitening toothpastes. Hydrogen peroxide has shown positive results involving teeth lightness and chroma shade parameters. It works by oxidizing colored pigments onto the enamel where the <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth can indeed become lighter. Hydrogen peroxide can be mixed with baking soda and salt to make a home-made toothpaste.|$|E
25|$|Qutb's written {{works are}} still widely {{available}} {{and have been}} translated into many Western languages. His best known work is Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq (Milestones), {{but the majority of}} Qutb's theory can be found in his Qur'anic commentary Fi zilal al-Qur'an (In the <b>Shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quran). This 30-volume work is noteworthy for its innovative method of interpretation, borrowing heavily from the literary analysis of Amin al-Khuli, while retaining some structural features of classical commentaries (for example, the practice of progressing from the first sura to the last). For Qutb, the Qur'an was seen as the final arbiter in all matters relating to faith, while his main goal in writing the book, In the <b>Shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur’an, was to restore the centrality of faith in the consciousness and imagination of Muslims, and to kindle a cognitive revolution that would bring about a political and social process that will lead to the renewal of the Islamic tradition.|$|E

25|$|Cultivation {{and fruit}} picking by hand is {{labour-intensive}} and needs around one person per hectare.

Their communities will avoid importing expensive diesel {{and there will be}} some for export too.|$|E
25|$|Qutb's {{career as}} a writer also heavily {{influenced}} his philosophy. In al-Taswiir al-Fanni fil-Quran (Artistic Representation in the Qur'an), Qutb developed a literary appreciation of the Qur'an and a complementary methodology for interpreting the text. His hermeneutics were applied in his extensive commentary on the Qur'an, Fi zilal al-Qur'an (In the <b>Shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quran), which served {{as the foundation for}} the declarations of Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. When {{a person}} watches {{different}} marrow-cell images {{he or she}} can identify every type of cells easily. In this process, human’s visual system has ability to adapt <b>the</b> different <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> color marrow cells images. We propose a segmentation method for marrow-cell images based on fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM). Firstly, <b>the</b> count <b>of</b> cluster is calculated out using <b>the</b> <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> R-matrix <b>of</b> a RGB formatted marrow cells image. Secondly, the fuzzy c-means clustering method is done on the R-matrix. Finally, <b>the</b> pixel <b>of</b> G-matrix and B-matrix are divided into some clusters by “one to one correspondence ” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> pixels that belong to R-matrix, G-matrix or B-matrix. This paper’s contribution could be summarized into three points: 1) a frame work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuzzy c-means clustering for marrow-cell images segmentation is proposed. 2) Using FCM and <b>the</b> R-matrix component <b>of</b> a RGB formatted marrow-cell images to generate <b>the</b> count <b>of</b> clustering. 3) This method could adaption different <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> different marrow-cell images...|$|R

25|$|This period saw the {{composition}} of his two most important works: a commentary of the Qur'an Fi Zilal al-Qur'an (In the <b>Shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an), and a manifesto of political Islam called Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq (Milestones). These works represent the final form of Qutb's thought, encompassing his radically anti-secular and anti-Western claims based on his interpretations of the Qur'an, Islamic history, and {{the social and political}} problems of Egypt. The school of thought he inspired has become known as Qutbism.|$|E
25|$|Rosso Corsa is the red {{international}} motor racing {{color of}} cars entered by teams from Italy. Since the 1920s Italian race cars of Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Lancia, and later Ferrari and Abarth have been painted with a color known as rosso corsa ("racing red"). National colors were mostly replaced in Formula One by commercial sponsor liveries in 1968, but unlike most other teams, Ferrari always kept the traditional red, although the <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> color varies.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds of {{peach and}} {{nectarine}} cultivars are known. These are classified into two categories—the freestones and the clingstones. Freestones are those whose flesh separates readily from the pit. Clingstones are those whose flesh clings tightly to the pit. Some cultivars are partially freestone and clingstone, so are called semifree. Freestone types are preferred for eating fresh, while clingstone types are for canning. The fruit flesh may be creamy white to deep yellow; the hue and <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> color {{depends on the}} cultivar.|$|E

25|$|A forest butterfly, {{the brown}} awl favours {{openings}} and edges of deciduous and evergreen forests while its caterpillars {{are to be}} found in moist deciduous and semi-evergreen forests.

It can be sometimes seen in bright sunlight visiting flowers, such as Glycosmis, Buddleia, Chromolaena and Lantana, but is very wary and energetic at such times, moving jerkily and rapidly between flowers or across inflorescences. It can also be seen mud-puddling or at bird droppings.|$|E

The newspapers reported 130 Dungarees arriving in Goodna, but as Lieutenant Binnie pointed out, there were often discrepancies in the numbers. This was because not all men nominating passed the medical test, while others nominated, but deferred their enlistment until arrangements were made with their employers.|$|E

While clear colors are preferred by registries, such natural variation in <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coat {{is not to be}} considered a fault. Brown and cafe-au-lait poodles have liver-colored noses, eye rims and lips, dark toenails and dark amber eyes. Black, blue, gray, silver, cream and white poodles have black noses, eye rims and lips, black or self-colored toenails and very dark eyes. In the apricots, while the foregoing coloring is preferred, liver-colored noses, eye rims and lips, and amber eyes are permitted, but are not desirable. Incomplete color of nose, lips and eye rims, or a [...] "mismatched" [...] color are considered faults by registries.|$|R
