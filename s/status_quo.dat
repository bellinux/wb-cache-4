5|$|As Ottoman {{rule in the}} Balkans expanded, Albanian timar holders and {{officials}} were once again replaced with Anatolian ones.

5|$|A call {{like this}} might be a bit ambiguous, but it was unsettling to those who were {{on the side of the}} <b>status</b> <b>quo.</b> Yiddish theater was banned in Russia {{starting}} September 14, 1883, as part of the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Czar Alexander II. Goldfaden and his troupe were left adrift in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.|$|E
5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the life and career of Nerva before his {{accession}} as Emperor in 96, he appears to have been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors. His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to expectations, the American bombing effort had not {{pulverized}} the Base Areas and {{had only}} tended to drive PAVN and the NLF deeper into the Cambodian countryside. This series of events began to pose questions for Hanoi. The North Vietnamese {{had been willing to}} maintain the <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> in Cambodia as long as their supply lines and sanctuaries were secure. But with the expansion of the war across the border they might have to take further steps to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, the Greeks revolted against centuries-long Ottoman rule. They won {{numerous}} victories {{early on}} and declared independence.

In contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe, the Holy Alliance did not intervene to stop the liberal Greek insurgents.|$|E

5|$|The <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> is {{no longer}} an option and there is an unquenchable desire for greater devolution. Quite simply, the Scottish people want to be more {{directly}} and deeply involved in the decisions that affect them and the generations to come.

5|$|The terms First World, Second World, and Third World were {{originally}} used {{to divide the}} world's nations into three categories. The model did not emerge to its end state all at once.

5|$|After Germany surrendered, the Allies {{partitioned}} Berlin and Germany's remaining territory {{into four}} military occupation zones.

The treaty confirmed the right of John Zápolya as a king of all Hungary, but recognised Ferdinand's possession of {{that part of the}} country that enjoyed the <b>status</b> <b>quo.</b>|$|E
