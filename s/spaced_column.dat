40|$|Abstract—Flat {{plate is}} the term used for a slab system without any column flares or drop panels. Although column {{patterns}} are usually on a rectangular grid, flat plates {{can be used with}} irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>column</b> layouts. In flat plate loads directly to supporting columns, which is different from other two way systems by the lack of beams, column capitals, and drop panels. In tall multistoried structures the flat plate floor system has week resistance to lateral loads like wind, hence special features like shear walls, structural Walls are to be provided {{if they are to be}} used in High rise constructions. In the present investigation numerical studies for 20, 40, 60, 80 storied for frames with normal conventional beam supported slab system, flat plate floor system, flat plate floor system with Shear walls has been conducted.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} numerical simulations {{investigating the}} settlement reduction caused by stone columns {{in a natural}} soft clay. The {{focus is on the}} influence of the soft soil alteration caused by column installation. A uniform mesh of end-bearing columns under a distributed load was considered. Therefore, the columns were modelled using the "unit cell" concept, i. e. only one column and the corresponding surrounding soil in axial symmetry. The properties of the soft clay correspond to Bothkennar clay, which is modelled using S-CLAY 1 and S-CLAY 1 S, which are Cam clay type models that account for anisotropy and destructuration. The Modified Cam clay model is also used for comparison. Column installation was modelled independently to avoid mesh distortions, and soft soil alteration was directly considered in the initial input values. The results show that the changes in the stress field, such as the increase of radial stresses and mean stresses and the loss of overconsolidation, are beneficial for high loads and closely <b>spaced</b> <b>columns</b> but, on the contrary, may be negative for low loads, widely <b>spaced</b> <b>columns</b> and overconsolidated soils. Moreover, whilst the rotation of the soil fabric reduces the settlement, in contrast the soil destructuration during column installation reduces the improvement...|$|R
