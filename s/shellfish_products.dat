40|$|Abstract OnlyThe western Indian Ocean {{coastal regions}} {{are poised to}} develop the great potential, largely {{untapped}} to date, for increased seafood production from marine aquaculture. The scales at which aquaculture development in the region proceeds will determine how the benefits from this economic activity are distributed. Finfish and shellfish farming can be pursued {{at a variety of}} scales. Some forms of aquaculture, including tilapia farming in ponds, can be conducted effectively at the small (family) scale, while others (shrimp farming, ocean cage farming) are most efficient at larger (corporate) scales. Marine shellfish farming in particular can be very efficient at the family scale, with adequate infrastructure support. In coastal villages in Tanzania and other parts of East Africa, local species of clams and oysters can be farmed by individuals or small cooperatives in ways that are ecologically and economically sound. Shellfish farming can generate revenues of several hundred dollars/year/person at this scale, and can provide economic opportunity for women as well as men. Significant markets for additional <b>shellfish</b> <b>product</b> exist in local communities, in tourist restaurants, and in international export markets. Infrastructure requirements to support such farming include hatcheries and training in shellfish grow out and business skills.

Three doses of <b>shellfish</b> <b>products</b> (500, 1000 and 1500 kg. ha- 1) and NPK fertilizer were tested in a split-plot design with three repetitions.

40|$|This {{multidisciplinary}} {{analysis of}} Namibia marine aquaculture developments {{has found it}} {{to have a good}} potential. Existing Namibian aquaculture laws are comprehensive in nature controlling aspects such as water, land, public health, sanitation and disease, however they ignore fish welfare. Mean temperature of Namibian marine coastal waters in the 150 m water depth strata has averaged at 14. 07 oC for the last eleven years (1993 - 2003). The marine waters in the central area of Namibian coastline are colder than the waters both northward and southward. Temperature decreased with water depth at a gradient of about 0. 1 oC/m in the 100 m water depth strata. Mean salinity averaged at 34. 89 ‰ with low variation in the 100 m water depth column. Species which are considered for aquaculture are ranked on the scale of one to ten according to their respective potentials based on both environmental and economic issues: Oysters (Crassostrea gigas and Ostrea edulis) are ranked at 9 / 10, Abalone (Haliotis midae) 8 / 10, Mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) 8 / 10, Rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) 7 / 10, Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) 6 / 10, Hake (Merluccius capensis) with 5 / 10 and Cobia (Rachycentron canadum) 3 / 10. Despite {{the fact that most of}} the species considered can live within temperature and salinity ranges of Namibian marine coastal waters at different latitudes and depths, their respective farming successes can be enhanced by research to investigate specie-specific conditions that promote their yields. Economically farming of shellfish has better potential than finfish due its low production costs which is partly a result of adjacent nutrient rich Benguela ecosystem and promising investment returns as a result increasing <b>shellfish</b> <b>product</b> demands and prices...|$|R

Using Rhode Island data, this study aims to understand and quantify the market interactions of wild harvested <b>shellfish</b> <b>products</b> in Rhode Island. Specifically, we estimated how sensitive are the exvessel prices of <b>shellfish</b> <b>products</b> (three market categories for quahog, scallop, and whelk) with respect to the quantity landed, both of its own and other products. The data were obtained from Statistical Atlantic Fisheries Information System (SAFIS) and analyzed using Nonlinear Inverse Almost Ideal Demand System (NL-IAIDS) to estimate the price sensitivity of shellfish. We found that exvessel prices were inflexible to the variation in quantity landed, however the magnitude of sensitivity varied across products: most sensitive was necks and least sensitive was cherrystone. The study also found that <b>shellfish</b> <b>products</b> included in this study were all substitutes to each other which have a policy implication. The substitutive relationship between the shellfish species would help fishermen to maintain their profit by switching to catch other species/products if catch of one of the species/products is predominant.

40|$|Cyclic imines (CIs) are a {{group of}} {{phytoplankton}} produced toxins related to <b>shellfish</b> food <b>products,</b> {{some of which are}} already present in UK and European waters. Their risk to shellfish consumers is poorly understood, as while no human intoxication has been definitively related to this group, their fast acting toxicity following intraperitoneal injection in mice has led to concern over their human health implications. A request was therefore made by UK food safety authorities to examine these toxins more closely to aid possible management strategies. Of the CI producers only the spirolide producer Alexandrium ostenfeldii is known to exist in UK waters at present but trends in climate change may lead to increased risk from other organisms/CI toxins currently present elsewhere in Europe and in similar environments worldwide. This paper reviews evidence concerning the prevalence of CIs and CI-producing phytoplankton, together with testing methodologies. Chemical, biological and biomolecular methods are reviewed, including recommendations for further work to enable effective testing. Although the focus here is on the UK, from a strategic standpoint many of the topics discussed will also be of interest {{in other parts of the}} world since new and emerging marine biotoxins are of global concern...|$|R

Analyses of the protein content and metabolism of shellfish are therefore of utmost importance to monitor the presence and effects of environmental contaminants in these organisms and also to assess food quality and authenticity. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare different protein extraction protocols commonly used in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 DE) research and select the most suitable for the analysis of gill and digestive gland proteomes from the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. RESULTS: High-resolution protein separation was achieved by direct solubilisation of proteins from M. galloprovincialis tissues with urea (7 mol L− 1), thiourea (2 mol L− 1), CHAPS (40 g L− 1), DTT (65 mmol L− 1) and ampholytes (pH 4 – 7, 8 mLL− 1). Subsequent protein identification from 2 DEgels by MALDI-TOF/TOFmass spectrometry revealed a high number of proteinswith functions in cytoskeleton structure, dynamics andmaintenance. Other proteins identified in the 2 DE gels are involved in energy production and carbohydratemetabolism, metal transport, chaperones and stress response, cell signalling and regulation, proteolysis and protein transduction. CONCLUSION: Important protein markers for contaminant and quality assessment of <b>shellfish</b> food <b>products</b> can be analysed using 2 DE...|$|R
