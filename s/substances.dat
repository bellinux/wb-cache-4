5|$|Track {{and field}} athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain <b>substances</b> by {{governing}} bodies for the sport, {{from the national}} to the international level. The IAAF's constitution incorporates the World Anti-Doping Code among other anti-doping measures. Practices such as blood doping {{and the use of}} anabolic steroids, peptide hormones, stimulants, or diuretics can give athletes a physical competitive advantage in track and field. The use of such <b>substances</b> in track and field is opposed on both ethical and medical grounds. Given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes' performances, performance-enhancing <b>substances</b> create an uneven playing field — athletes who do not use doping <b>substances</b> have a disadvantage over rivals who do. Medically, the use of banned <b>substances</b> may have an adverse effect upon athletes' health. However, some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned <b>substances</b> for therapeutic use, and athletes are not sanctioned for usage in these cases, such as Kim Collins' failed drug test due to asthma medication.|$|E

50|$|There are {{on-going}} debates as to {{the exact}} distinctions between <b>substance</b> abuse and <b>substance</b> dependence, but current practice standard distinguishes between the two by defining <b>substance</b> dependence in terms of physiological and behavioral symptoms of <b>substance</b> use, and <b>substance</b> abuse {{in terms of the}} social consequences of <b>substance</b> use.

40|$|The COOH-terminal arnide of <b>substance</b> P was {{replaced}} with a methyl ester, and the potency of this <b>substance</b> P methyl ester was {{compared with that of}} <b>substance</b> P and <b>substance</b> P free acid in stimulating salivation in rats and in stimulating guinea pig ileum contraction in vitro.

The results suggest that the hydrophobicity of the COOH-terminal portion of <b>substance</b> P may be important for the molecule in its interaction with the <b>substance</b> P receptor. The <b>substance</b> P molecule (Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Gln-Phe-Phe-Gly-Leu-Met-NH 2) can be divided into two do-mains according to physical and chemical properties and biological activities.

40|$|This {{current study}} {{describes}} alcoholism, drug abuse, {{and mental illness}} as risk factors among adults whose parents were <b>substance</b> abusers.

The study suggests having a <b>substance</b> abusive parent increases the risk of the child to develop <b>substance</b> dependencies as well as mental illness in their adulthood. Through parental modeling children witness <b>substance</b> abuse and dependency. As a result, the behavior becomes innate. The results depict a significant statistical relationship at the. 05 level of probability between parental <b>substance</b> abuse influencers and <b>substance</b> dependencies as well as mental illness amongst the persons that have been exposed to parental <b>substance</b> abuse influencers during their childhood. Alcoholism, drug abuse, and mental illness are risk factors among adults whose parents were <b>substance</b> abusers.

40|$|Social {{capital is}} {{described}} as a protective factor against youth <b>substance</b> use, but it may also be associated with behaviours that do not enhance health. The present study hypothesized that 'substance use capital', i. e. resources favourable to <b>substance</b> use, is a risk factor for <b>substance</b> use and misuse. We used baseline data from the ongoing Cohort Study on <b>Substance</b> Use Risk Factors (C-SURF) that included a representative sample of young Swiss men (n= 5623). <b>Substance</b> use (alcohol, cannabis, 15  illicit drugs, lifetime use, hazardous use and dependence), <b>substance</b> use capital (parental and peer attitudes towards <b>substance</b> use, parental and peer drug use, perceived norms of <b>substance</b> use) and aspects of social capital (relationships with parents and peers) were assessed. Logistic regressions were used to examine the associations between substance-related resources and social resources, and <b>substance</b> use. Results showed that substance-related resources were associated with an increased risk of <b>substance</b> use (OR between 1. 25 and 4. 67), whereas social resources' associations with <b>substance</b> use were commonly protective but weaker than substance-related resources. Thus, a drug-friendly environment facilitated <b>substance</b> use and misuse. Moreover, the results showed that peer environments were more drug-friendly than familial environments. In conclusion, this study highlighted a concept of 'substance use capital', which may be useful for advancing both theoretical and applied knowledge of <b>substance</b> use. Indeed, <b>substance</b> use is not only associated with a lack of social resources, but also with specific drug-friendly social resources coming from environment and background...|$|R
40|$|The {{harmful effects}} of <b>substance</b> abuse among {{adolescents}} and its close association with juvenile crime and recidivism have been well documented. While a legal referral to the juvenile court may prompt an assessment of <b>substance</b> abuse or dependence, juvenile court diversion personnel must often rely only on an informal interview to determine the presence or severity of a juvenile's <b>substance</b> abuse problem. This {{may result in a}} failure to detect underlying <b>substance</b> abuse problems and to initiate appropriate treatment. The present study explored whether or not a standardized instrument, the Adolescent <b>Substance</b> Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI-A 2) might improve identification of <b>substance</b> abuse problems in juvenile offenders who had been referred to one of two early intervention classes (a Misdemeanor class or a <b>Substance</b> Abuse class). Fifty-four percent of the sample met the criteria for a high probability of either a <b>Substance</b> Abuse Disorder or a <b>Substance</b> Dependence Disorder as measured by the SASSI-A 2. Nearly twenty-six percent (25. 9 %) of juveniles in the Misdemeanor class and 35. 7 % of the juveniles in the <b>Substance</b> Abuse class met the criteria for a <b>substance</b> abuse disorder. Nearly fifteen percent (14. 7 %) of juveniles in the Misdemeanor class and 33. 3 % in the <b>Substance</b> Abuse class met criteria for a <b>Substance</b> Dependence Disorder.
