50|$|<b>Saturation</b> <b>attack</b> is a {{military}} tactic in which the attacking side hopes to gain an advantage by overwhelming the defending side's technological, physical and mental ability to respond effectively. During the Cold War and after, the conventional saturation missile attack against naval and land targets was and is a much feared eventuality.|$|E
50|$|The only surefire way of {{countering}} a <b>saturation</b> <b>attack</b> is {{to destroy}} launch vehicles {{before they can}} begin their attack. For example, during the Cold War, the primary target of saturation attacks from the Soviet Naval Aviation, were the United States Navy aircraft carriers. In response the United States adopted the doctrine of attempting to destroy the Soviet missile aircraft before they could launch their missiles, {{this led to the}} Douglas F6D Missileer, which would give rise to the Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye and Grumman F-14 Tomcat/AIM-54 Phoenix pairing.|$|E
5000|$|In the Soviet Navy, cruisers {{formed the}} basis of combat groups. In the {{immediate}} post-war era it built a fleet of gun-armed light cruisers, but replaced these beginning in the early 1960s with large ships called [...] "rocket cruisers", carrying large numbers of anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) and anti-aircraft missiles. The Soviet combat doctrine of <b>saturation</b> <b>attack</b> meant that their cruisers (as well as destroyers and even missile boats) mounted multiple missiles in large container/launch tube housings and carried far more ASCMs than their NATO counterparts, while NATO combatants instead used individually smaller and lighter missiles (while appearing under-armed when compared to Soviet ships).|$|E

50|$|In cryptography, {{integral}} cryptanalysis is a cryptanalytic {{attack that}} is particularly applicable to block ciphers based on substitution-permutation networks. It was originally designed by Lars Knudsen as a dedicated attack against Square, so it {{is commonly known as}} the Square attack. It was also extended to a few other ciphers related to Square: CRYPTON, Rijndael, and SHARK. Stefan Lucks generalized the attack to what he called a <b>saturation</b> <b>attack</b> and used it to attack Twofish, which is not at all similar to Square, having a radically different Feistel network structure. Forms of integral cryptanalysis have since been applied to a variety of ciphers, including Hierocrypt, IDEA, Camellia, Skipjack, MISTY1, MISTY2, SAFER++, KHAZAD, and FOX (now called IDEA NXT).|$|E
50|$|A <b>saturation</b> <b>attack</b> by YJ-12's {{fired at}} long range would pose a grave threat to American carrier strike groups; once {{the wave of}} sea-skimming {{missiles}} appeared over the horizon and was detected by ships' own sensors, they would only have some 45 seconds to engage before impact {{and if there were}} enough, short range defenses would be overwhelmed. Given that fighters such as the Su-30MKK and J-11B have a combat radius of about 1,500 km, equipping them with the YJ-12 gives them a potential strike range out to 1,900 km. The U.S. Navy's counter is to use the Cooperative Engagement Capability to detect and destroy the YJ-12's launch aircraft with SM-6 missiles and fighters at long range before they can be fired.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the later}} 20th century, the {{obsolescence}} of the battleship left the cruiser {{as the largest}} and most powerful surface combatant after the aircraft carrier. The role of the cruiser varied according to ship and navy, often including air defense and shore bombardment. During the Cold War, the Soviet Navy's cruisers had heavy anti-ship missile armament designed to sink NATO carrier task forces via <b>saturation</b> <b>attack.</b> The U.S. Navy built guided-missile cruisers upon destroyer-style hulls (some called [...] "destroyer leaders" [...] or [...] "frigates" [...] prior to the 1975 reclassification) primarily designed to provide air defense while often adding anti-submarine capabilities, being larger and having longer-range surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) than early Charles F.

5000|$|The Type 45 destroyers are {{primarily}} designed for anti-air warfare with {{the capability to}} defend against targets such as fighter aircraft, drones as well as highly maneuverable sea skimming anti-ship missiles travelling at supersonic speeds. The Royal Navy describes the destroyers' mission as being [...] "to shield the Fleet from air attack".The Type 45 destroyer is equipped with the Sea Viper (PAAMS) air-defence system utilizing the SAMPSON {{active electronically scanned array}} multi-function radar and the S1850M long-range radar. PAAMS is able to track over 2,000 targets and simultaneously control and coordinate multiple missiles in the air at once, allowing a large number of tracks to be intercepted and destroyed at any given time. This makes it particularly difficult to swamp PAAMS during a <b>saturation</b> <b>attack,</b> even against supersonic targets. The US Naval War College has suggested that the SAMPSON radar is capable of tracking 1,000 objects the size of a cricket ball travelling at three times the speed of sound (Mach 3), emphasising the system's capabilities against high performance stealth targets.A core component of PAAMS is the Aster missile, comprising Aster 15 and Aster 30. MBDA describe Aster as a [...] "hit-to-kill" [...] anti-missile missile capable of intercepting all types of high performance air threats at a maximum range of 120 km. The Aster missile is autonomously guided and equipped with an active RF seeker enabling it to cope with [...] "saturated attacks" [...] thanks to a [...] "multiple engagement capability" [...] and a [...] "high rate of fire". Presently the Daring-class destroyers are equipped with a 48-cell A50 Sylver Vertical Launching System allowing for a mix of up to 48 Aster 15 and 30 missiles.|$|E

50|$|The same {{advantages}} that made planes so successful against surface ships in World War II are largely still existent today. Aircraft can attack {{in large numbers}} with little warning and can carry multiple weapons that are each capable of disabling a ship. While warships are able to carry powerful defensive technologies the need to destroy every incoming missile leaves them at a disadvantage. Missiles and supersonic aircraft are very difficult targets to hit {{and even the most}} advanced systems cannot provide certainty of interception. During the Cold War the gulf was at its most pronounced, with saturation missile attacks a major concern but the gulf has closed a little in recent time. The advent of phased array radar on ships allow them to track and target a far larger number of targets at one time, increasing the number of missiles needed to saturate defences. The arrival of vertical launching systems allow for dozens of SAMs to be launched almost simultaneously from each ship, a substantial advance over older missile launchers that could only fire one or two missiles before reloading. Should salvoes of SAMs fail to destroy a <b>saturation</b> <b>attack,</b> 'soft kill' countermeasures are complemented by the invention of the point-defence Close in Weapons System, 'CIWS', usually a rapid-fire autocannon sometimes paired with a missile system as a last line of defence. Finally the arrival of networked fleet level defence direction using many radars and many launch platforms together to intercept a cloud of missiles allows for better use of defence resources. Previously each ship would have to act individually against a coordinated attack which leads to defensive fire being wasted on the same targets. Networking also brings information from airborne radar, giving vastly longer range than any ship board radar could achieve due to the radar horizon.|$|E

By exploiting this loophole, we propose an active side-channel attack on the Gaussian-modulated coherent state CV-QKD protocol combining an intercept-resend attack with an induced saturation of the homodyne detection on the receiver side (Bob). We show that an attacker can bias the excess noise estimation by displacing the quadratures of the coherent states received by Bob.

Abstract Software defined networking (SDN) is a new networking paradigm {{that in recent years}} has revolutionized network architectures. At its core, SDN separates the data plane, which provides data forwarding functionalities, and the control plane, which implements the network control logic. The separation of these two components provides a virtually centralized point of control in the network, {{and at the same time}} abstracts the complexity of the underlying physical infrastructure. Unfortunately, while promising, the SDN approach also introduces new attacks and vulnerabilities. Indeed, previous research shows that, under certain traffic conditions, the required communication between the control and data plane can result in a bottleneck. An attacker can exploit this limitation to mount a new, network-wide, type of denial of service attack, known as the control plane <b>saturation</b> <b>attack.</b> This paper presents LineSwitch, an efficient and effective data plane solution to tackle the control plane <b>saturation</b> <b>attack.</b> LineSwitch employs probabilistic proxying and blacklisting of network traffic to prevent the attack from reaching the control plane, and thus preserve network functionality. We implemented LineSwitch as an extension of the reference SDN implementation, OpenFlow, and run a thorough set of experiments under different traffic and attack scenarios. We compared LineSwitch to the state of the art, and we show that it provides at the same time, the same level of protection against the control plane <b>saturation</b> <b>attack,</b> and a reduced time overhead by up to 30...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedNearly {{a decade after}} the small boat attacks against the USS Cole (in 2000) and M/V Limburg (in 2002) in Yemen, small vessels continue to pose a security threat. In part, {{this is due to the}} ease of camouflage and the high frequency of small vessels operating in proximity to important maritime infrastructure, such as bridges and petrochemical plants, and to passenger and military ships. In this study, small boat effectiveness in the interception of attacking speedboats is analyzed using the stochastic, time-stepped, agent-based simulation tool MANA. Three alternative defender tactics of scramble from base, barrier patrol, and random patrol are explored against two possible attacker modus operandi of <b>saturation</b> <b>attack</b> and diversionary attack. The probability of at least one attacker reaching the defended asset is the primary measure of effectiveness. A full factorial experiment was designed and executed for defenders tasked to protect the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Hong Kong. The findings indicate that the defenders are highly susceptible to diversionary attacks regardless of tactics employed, but their effectiveness can be improved by retaining sufficient defensive assets in preparation for a potential follow on attack. The study highlights the limits on patrol boat effectiveness to intercept small high speed vessels which lead to the nullification of any numerical advantage the defender may have when faced with a <b>saturation</b> <b>attack.</b> Anticipating the heading of the attacker is a critical factor for a successful engagement.

40|$|Abstract. The mere {{number of}} various {{apparently}} different statistical attacks on block ciphers {{has raised the}} question about their relation-ships which would allow to classify them and determine those that give essentially complementary information about the security of block ci-phers. While mathematical links between some statistical attacks have been derived {{in the last couple}} of years, the important link between gen-eral truncated differential and multidimensional linear attacks has been missing. In this work we close this gap. The new link is then exploited to relate the complexities of chosen-plaintext and known-plaintext distin-guishing attacks of differential and linear types, and further, to explore the relations between the key-recovery attacks. Our analysis shows that a statistical <b>saturation</b> <b>attack</b> is the same as a truncated differential attack, which allows us, for the first time, to provide a justifiable analy-sis of the complexity of the statistical <b>saturation</b> <b>attack</b> and discuss its validity on 24 rounds of the PRESENT block cipher. By studying the data, time and memory complexities of a multidimensional linear key-recovery attack and its relation with a truncated differential one, we also show that in most cases a known-plaintext attack can be transformed into a less costly chosen-plaintext attack. In particular, we show that there is a differential attack in the chosen-plaintext model on 26 rounds of PRESENT with less memory complexity than the best previous at-tack, which assumes known plaintext. The links between the statistical attacks discussed in this paper give further examples of attacks where the method used to sample the data required by the statistical test is more differentiating than the method used for finding the distinguishing property...|$|E

First, we investigate the existence of better trails than the one used in the former attack. For this purpose, we provide a theoretical evaluation of the trail distributions using proba-bility transition matrices. Since the exhaustive evaluation of all possible distributions {{turned out to be}} computationally hard, we additionally pro-vide a heuristic branch-and-bound algorithm that allows us to generate a large number of good trails. These tools confirm that the trail of CT-RSA 2009 was among the best possible ones, but also suggest that numerous other trails have similar properties. As a consequence, we investigate the use of multiple trails and show that it allows significant improvements of the previous cryptanalysis attempts against PRESENT. Estimated complexities indicate that PRESENT- 80 is safe against key recovery, by a small security margin. We also discuss the impact of multiple trails for the security of the full PRESENT- 128. We finally put forward a “statis-tical hull ” effect that makes the precise theoretical analysis of our results difficult, when the number of block cipher rounds increases...|$|R

CAMM is 99 kg in weight, 3.2 m in length, 166 mm diameter and reaches generous supersonic speeds of Mach 3 (or 1,020 meters per second). CAMM is a ship point defence and local area defence missile designed to respond to sophisticated missile attacks and has the capability to defend against <b>saturation</b> <b>attacks</b> of supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles, aircraft and other high-performance targets. It does this via multiple channels of fire, providing 360-degree coverage and high degrees of manoeuvrability. MBDA state that CAMM has a [...] "high rate of fire against multiple simultaneous targets", providing capabilities comparable to the Aster 15 missile. In flight, the missile can receive mid-course guidance via a datalink before the active homing radar seeker takes over for the final approach to target. This does away {{with the need for}} separate tracking radars, making CAMM compatible with any 2D or 3D surveillance radars and allows targets to be hit that are not in line-of-sight.|$|R
