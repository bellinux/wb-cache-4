40|$|This study {{fills in}} {{knowledge}} gaps for the European air-conditioning (AC) market, which is fundamentally important to raising awareness about primary energy utilization. In contrast to space heating (SH) and {{domestic hot water}} (DHW) preparation, the European Union (EU) AC market is barely explored in scientific literature. While the focus of previous research {{has been on the}} residential sector, a shortfall of data for the services (wholesale and retail, offices, education, health, hotels and bars) exists. In this paper, data describing the actual space cooling (<b>SC)</b> <b>market</b> in Europe (quantity of SC units, equivalent full-load hours, installed capacities, seasonal energy efficiency values as well as cooled floor area per AC type and/or sector) is collected and explored using a bottom-up approach. Results indicate that SC is responsible for a significant portion of EU electricity consumption in households (nearly 5 %) and even more in the service sector (~ 13 %). Energy consumption for SC in the EU 28 appears to be more than 140 TWh/y. The quantification of the European AC consumption shows {{a significant difference between the}} service and residential sectors: about 115 versus 25 TWh/y respectively. The <b>SC</b> <b>market</b> in Europe is characterized by a high potential for growth, especially in households.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{flexible}} service provision in electric power systems has dramatically increased {{due to the}} growing penetration of variable energy resources, as has the need to ensure fair access and compensation for this provision. A swing contract (SC) facilitates flexible service provision because it permits multiple service attributes to be offered together in bundled form with each attribute expressed as a range of possible values {{rather than as a}} single point value. This paper discusses a new <b>SC</b> <b>Market</b> Design for electric power systems that permits SCs to be offered by any dispatchable resource. An analytical optimization formulation is developed for the clearing of an SC day-ahead market that can be implemented using any standard mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver. The practical feasibility of the optimization formulation is demonstrated by means of a numerical example...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we design {{contract}} mechanisms {{to increase the}} efficiency of product line decisions in a Supply Chain (SC). A two stage SC with a buyer and the supplier is considered. The end consumers are comprised of two segments with different willingness to pay. The final demand and the segments’ willingness to pay are assumed to be deterministic. Two different settings are analyzed: A generalized setting where the end consumer’s willingness to pay is proportional {{to the quality of the}} product and the second is a specialized case where the consumer’s willingness to pay is independent of the quality of the product. It is demonstrated that in both the settings a decentralized SC stocks less number of product variants when compared to centralized <b>SC.</b> <b>Marketing</b> literature suggests that the so-called “slotting allowance” is a mechanism {{to increase the efficiency}} of product line decisions. However, the literature on slotting allowance does not address the issue of coordination and win-win. In this paper we discuss the revenue and profit sharing mechanisms. It is shown that not only these mechanisms coordinate the SC but that they also provide win-win to both players...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} concerns about privacy and data control {{as one of}} the factors, many small clouds (SCs) established by different providers are emerging in an attempt to meet demand locally. The flip-side of this approach is the problem of resource inelasticity faced by the SCs due to their relatively scarce resources (e. g., virtual machines), thereby leading to potential degradation of customer QoS and loss of revenue. A proposed solution to this problem recommends the sharing of resources between SCs to alleviate the resource inelasticity issues that might arise. However, effective borrowing of resources by an SC from its peers involves mutually satisfying the interests of the stakeholders in question, i. e., the SC customers, the SCs, and a regulatory agency (e. g., the federal government) overseeing the functioning of the SCs. In this paper, we model the 'stakeholder satisfaction problem' in SCs as a socially efficient dynamic market/ecosystem design task, where the market elements comprise the stakeholders, and the term 'social efficiency' implying the market reaching a utilitarian maximum social welfare state when in equilibrium. Our market design approach is based on Arrow and Hurwicz's disequilibrium process and uses the gradient play technique in game theory to iteratively converge upon efficient and stable market equilibria. We illustrate the stability and sustainability of <b>SC</b> <b>markets</b> via both theory and experiments. Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computin...|$|R

40|$|Many European and North American Supercalendered (SC) paper {{manufacturers}} have begun using precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) fillers or are running trials to evaluate PCC. The drivers for this interest are the optical and bulk advantages that PCC {{can bring to}} this grade as well as overall cost savings. These drivers give the SC producer some key advantages in the increasingly competitive publication papers market. To most effectively use PCC fillers, {{it is best to}} take a “holistic “ approach to the conversion. This requires that all aspects of the paper production process are examined including the pulp/bleach plant, the paper machine, the supercalenders, and the printing processes used to print the paper. When this planning is properly done, low risk trials can be run and conversions can be completed rapidly with a relatively short “learning curve”. PCC and the <b>SC</b> Paper <b>Market</b> As shown in Table 1 below, a number of mills producing SC and soft-nip calendered (SNC) grades have either converted to alkaline or have recently run trials with calcium carbonate fillers.

40|$|Transit {{passenger}} {{market segmentation}} enables transit operators to target different classes of transit users to provide customized information and services. The Smart Card (SC) data, from Automated Fare Collection system, facilitates {{the understanding of}} multiday travel regularity of transit passengers, {{and can be used}} to segment them into identifiable classes of similar behaviors and needs. However, the use of <b>SC</b> data for <b>market</b> segmentation has attracted very limited attention in the literature. This paper proposes a novel methodology for mining spatial and temporal travel regularity from each individual passenger’s historical SC transactions and segments them into four segments of transit users. After reconstructing the travel itineraries from historical SC transactions, the paper adopts the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to mine travel regularity of each SC user. The travel regularity is then used to segment SC users by an a priori market segmentation approach. The methodology proposed in this paper assists transit operators to understand their passengers and provide them oriented information and services...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} and describe the conditions that compel and underscore global supply chain (SC) adaptations. Design/methodology/approach – Insights from contingency theory, Porter’s economic cluster theory and international factory mapping are used to analyze the SC adaptations that follow when an automotive firm moves from a domestic to a global SC. Findings – An automotive global <b>SC</b> adaptation includes <b>market</b> entry considerations, the establishment of a three-stage flexible time- and production-based supplier network plan, and the integration of logistics partners. Research limitations/implications – SC adaptations are an important consideration for any manufacturing expansion effort, especially international ones. Varying production levels impact supplier relationships and decisions and may result in varied supplier perspectives. Government regulations influence entry and routine decisions, while logistics issues and costs play an integral role in supplier perceptions and reactions. Practical implications – With the rapid expansion of the Chinese auto market, entering manufacturing firms need more information about how to strategically locate, and develop and support supplier networks. A stepped supplier network establishment approach optimizes benefits for both manufacturing firmand suppliers. Evaluating and integrating logistics issues also sets the stage for future expansion efforts at optimal cost and supplier support. Originality/value – The internationalization of the automotive SC involves adaptations that can only be successful through advance planning, strategic supplier networking, and systematic logistics integration...|$|R
40|$|M. <b>Sc.</b> (Botany) The <b>market</b> {{and public}} demand for {{medicinal}} plants {{over the past}} few decades has increased dramatically with more than 1 000 plant species actively traded for medicinal purposes throughout South Africa. Intensive harvesting of wild material is now acknowledged as a serious threat to biodiversity in this country. Also the substitution of a valuable commodity (medicinal plant) by a cheaper alternative (other plant species), either inadvertently due to misidentification, or deliberately to cheat consumers, raises some serious concerns as these adulterants may not be as effective or may even be toxic and cause harm to consumers. To add to the problem many species are either traded as dried leaf, root, bark products, or extracts and their identification becomes problematic. Therefore, DNA barcoding can help to provide a rapid and accurate identification tool for medicinal plants. In the current study I targeted the most commonly used medicinal plants in South Africa and produced a set of barcodes for fast and easy DNA-based species identification (rbcLa & matK). I tested the efficiency of core barcodes in the identification of medicinal plants using four main analyses, in the R package Spider 1. 1 - 1. Here the extent of specific genetic divergence, DNA barcoding gap, BLAST test, and the ability to discriminate between species were assessed. Overall, the matK region was found to be a more useful tool for the species identification of medicinal plants in South Africa...|$|R
