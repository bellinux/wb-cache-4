5|$|Over time, Vrataski trains Cage {{to excel}} in combat training. Frustrated by his {{continued}} failures to excel, he retreats to London to spare his own life, but discovers that the Mimics will attack there after defeating the UDF in France. Eventually receiving {{a vision of a}} dam in Germany, indicating that the Omega is hiding there, Cage and Vrataski spend many loops figuring out how to escape the invasion and reach the dam. Cage comes to know Vrataski and falls in love with her, but Vrataski, who lost a loved one to the Mimics, is only interested in the mission. Upon reaching a point where she is killed whatever they do, Cage decides to fly to the dam on his own. Inside the dam, he is ambushed by an Alpha and Mimic struggling to bleed him out and <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> his ability to reset time. Before they can slowly bleed him to death, Cage deliberately drowns himself to avoid the process.|$|E

25|$|Sébastien Bourdais's first Formula One race {{ended on}} lap 56 after {{suffering}} an engine failure (Ferrari's {{third of the}} race). He was running 4th place in the Scuderia Toro Rosso {{at the time and}} had completed his final pit stop. At the end of the penultimate lap, Kovalainen finally passed Alonso coming out of turn 13, to take fourth place. But moments later on the pit straight, he went to tear a <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> his visor, and accidentally hit the pit lane speed limiter, allowing Alonso back through.|$|E
25|$|Sumatran orangutans use {{sticks to}} acquire seeds from a {{particular}} fruit. When {{the fruit of the}} Neesia tree ripens, its hard, ridged husk softens until it falls open. Inside are seeds that are highly desirable to the orangutans, but they are surrounded by fibreglass-like hairs that are painful if eaten. A Neesia-eating orangutan will select a 12cm stick, <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> the bark, and then carefully collect the hairs with it. Once the fruit is safe, the ape will eat the seeds using the stick or its fingers. Sumatran orangutans will use a stick to poke a bees' nest wall, move it around and catch the honey.|$|E
25|$|Three {{very special}} {{conditions}} {{are required for}} a star to evolve {{all the way to}} a gamma-ray burst under this theory: the star must be very massive (probably at least 40 Solar masses on the main sequence) to form a central black hole in the first place, the star must be rapidly rotating to develop an accretion torus capable of launching jets, and the star must have low metallicity in order to <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> its hydrogen envelope so the jets can reach the surface. As a result, gamma-ray bursts are far rarer than ordinary core-collapse supernovae, which only require that the star be massive enough to fuse all the way to iron.|$|E

25|$|The larvae of {{this species}} are notorious tent {{caterpillars}}. Tent caterpillars do not make tents, but rather, weave a silky sheet where they lie together during molting. They lay down strands of silk as they move over branches and then travel along them like tightrope walkers. They follow pheromones secreted by other larvae rather than following the silk lines themselves. The caterpillars are social, traveling together to feed. The caterpillars live in deciduous trees, which they <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> leaves after emerging from their eggs. The adult moth {{of this species}} favors oak, sweetgum, tupelo, aspen, and sugar maple for oviposition, but the larvae can be found feeding on many other species of woody trees or shrubs. The females lay eggs in masses of up to 300, which are stuck to twigs {{and covered with a}} gluey cement called spumaline, which prevents them from desiccating and freezing. The eggs hatch the following winter.|$|E
500|$|Tidal {{interactions}} add {{kinetic energy}} into a globular cluster, dramatically increasing the evaporation rate and shrinking {{the size of}} the cluster. Not only does tidal shock <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> the outer stars from a globular cluster, but the increased evaporation accelerates the process of core collapse. [...] The same physical mechanism may be at work in dwarf spheroidal galaxies such as the Sagittarius Dwarf, which appears to be undergoing tidal disruption due to its proximity to the Milky Way.|$|E
500|$|... "Material Girl" [...] was {{performed}} by Madonna on five of her world tours. She ended The Virgin Tour (1985) with a self-parodying performance of the song. She wore a white tube top and a tight white skirt and carried a bunch of notes in her left hand. At {{the end of the}} performance she asked the audience [...] "Do you really think I'm a material girl?...I'm not...Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] As she began to <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> more clothes, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, Tony Ciccone himself did the honors.

500|$|The video {{opens with}} the view of a city {{populated}} with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears {{on the back of}} a statue of an angry looking swan, and utters the line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love?" [...] This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pour incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, looking across the factory from her sitting room of her penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the workers staring up and looking for the source of the voice.|$|E
500|$|Ian Berriman of SFX {{rated the}} episode {{four and a}} half stars out of five and felt that it showed [...] "how every SF-related {{casualty}} {{is more than just a}} statistic– it’s also someone’s life-destroying tragedy". He thought the episode had a few logic gaps but that the emotional focus was enough to distract the audience from this. He felt that the sequence where Gwen's husband Rhys [...] "tears a <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> Gwen, then reminds her what Torchwood is fighting for" [...] was the episode's highlight. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy stated that the script [...] "neatly brings out the conflicting components within Gwen's character" [...] and praised the episode for raising the moral dilemma of whether to reveal the truth or not. He gave the episode four stars, feeling it to highlight the versatility of Torchwood as a series and to show [...] "how badly science-fiction is overlooked as serious, well-crafted drama". IGN's Travis Fickett rated the episode 9.5 out of ten ("Amazing") and stated it to be [...] "the kind of science fiction that every series should aspire to create." [...] He felt that the episode worked for viewers unfamiliar with the show whilst managing to progress [...] "every regular character in the series". He felt that the episode handled the subject matter of missing people thoughtfully and sensitively whilst furthering the relationship between Rhys and Gwen, stating that it was the [...] "best episode Gwen has had to date" [...] which showcased [...] "Eve Myles range" [...] and Kai Owen's [...] "tremendous power as an actor." [...] Fickett concluded his review by stating that [...] "this is very nearly a perfect episode of not just Torchwood, but the genre of science fiction and the medium of television".|$|E
500|$|As {{the guitar}} intro of [...] "Gambler" [...] started, Madonna {{stood on the}} side-stage and started dancing energetically, as {{flashlights}} fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled a steel structure present {{on the side of}} the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main one. She then performed [...] "Borderline", [...] "Lucky Star" [...] and [...] "Crazy for You"—while touching the hands of the audience members. Madonna then returned to the microphone and started singing [...] "Over and Over" [...] from Like a Virgin. It was followed by [...] "Burning Up" [...] during which she caressed one of the guitarist, ultimately disappearing for another constume change. As the music of the song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] started, Madonna returned on the stage, wearing a wedding dress, holding a bouquet in her hand and a long white veil behind her. Accessorized by a white bow atop her head and lacy, three-quarter length gloves, she also had a crucifix on her waistband and another hanging from a long chain around her neck. Madonna asked the audience [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] When the audience answered affirmatively, she threw the bouquet towards them and started singing the song. Madonna continued singing the song while rolling around the floor, and added a snippet of Michael Jackson's Motown-style single, [...] "Billie Jean". Balloons floated out towards the audience again as she pulled apart her veil and threw it towards the audience. She returned to the stage in the arms of one of the backup dancers, wearing a boob tube and a tight white skirt, carrying a bunch of notes in her left hand, and a number of garlands around her neck. In a self-parodying performance of the song [...] "Material Girl", at the end of the performance Madonna asked the audience [...] "Do you really think I'm a material girl?... I'm not... Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] As she began to <b>strip</b> <b>off</b> more clothes and jewelry, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, her father Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The show ended with Madonna returning onstage once more to take her fur coat and doing a curtsey.|$|E
