In experiment 1 we examine whether a favorable outcome bias, together with insensitivity to factors relating {{to the strength of}} evidence, could lead to over-reliance on weak substantive procedures. In experiment 2 we examine whether an explicit ex ante cue can sensitize auditors to the weaknesses of an unreliable <b>substantive</b> <b>procedure.</b> Our examination is conducted in the context of substantive analytical procedures that are performed to provide evidence during the substantive testing phase of an audit. The first experiment provides evidence that auditors attribute more strength to a weak, aggregate-level analytical procedure that produces an expectation that is not significantly different from the unaudited numbers (i. e., a “favorable ” outcome), than to the same analytical procedure that produces an expectation that is significantly different from the unaudited numbers. Further, auditors in the “favorable outcome ” conditio...|$|E

Thus, to preserve the maturity and skill expected of the respondents of the research we restricted a minimum of one year of auditing experience for the auditor that might have served in one of the Big Four Auditing firm.

Our analysis was based on absolute frequency analysis of the use of the <b>substantive</b> <b>procedures.</b> In this respect, our results revealed that auditor’s satisfaction is anchored on the materiality of the accounts or group of accounts to be audited.

This study investigates the effects of CAS competence and auditor AIS expertise on auditor planning judgments in a complex AIS environment. The audit literature has typically examined auditorsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 evaluations of evidence provided by sources with expertise structures similar to their own. However, the natural variation in knowledge structures that occurs between CAS and auditors likely results in a more complex relationship than those previously examined. Auditors were given a quasi-experimental case where the competence of the CAS was manipulated as high and low between auditors and auditor AIS expertise was measured. The case required auditors to evaluate evidence related to the audit of a complex AIS client to which a CAS had been assigned, assess current year inherent and control risks, and plan the nature, timing, and extent of <b>substantive</b> <b>procedures</b> for a transaction cycle. Results indicate that auditors possessing higher AIS expertise assessed both inherent and controls risks at higher levels and designed corresponding substantive tests that were greater in scope to mitigate those risks. For high AIS expertise auditors, both the quality of their risk assessments and the effectiveness of their scope of tests exceeded those of low AIS expertise auditors. Auditors were also sensitive to the reliability of CAS as an evidence source and assessed control risk higher when provided with control testing evidence from a CAS with low competence. When planning <b>substantive</b> <b>procedures,</b> auditorsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 AIS expertise levels moderated their reaction to CAS competence. Specifically, under conditions of low CAS competence, auditors with higher AIS expertise expanded the scope of their audit testing beyond the scope designed by auditors possessing lower AIS expertise. No such AIS expertise effect occurred under conditions of high CAS competence. These results suggest that auditor AIS expertise can play a significant role in complex AIS environments and in their ability to compensate for potential CAS competence deficiencies by increasing the scope of substantive tests. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the context}} of Romania's {{accession}} to the European Union, there was implied responsibility to adapt the country's legislative and judicial system to European system in order to implement the legal standards created and adopted by the European Union. This was transplanted adaptation which aimed, more clearly, for a potential unification and standardization of the Member States’ legal systems. Against the background of this transplantation and adaptation, legislative and judicial national systems encountered a series of practical difficulties. In considering the diversity and particularity of a new European legal system, there were, even, reactions of rejecting some of the European legal norms of transplantation. Extending the law's area of <b>substantive</b> <b>procedures</b> {{was a result of}} mutations of the Members States’ legal systems by creating a new European legal order. Identifying and eliminating the negative effects of defective transplantation of European legal standards might lead to prevention of the national legal system's possible legislative and legal vulnerability.

40|$|Auditors use <b>substantive</b> {{analytical}} <b>procedures</b> to make assertions {{about the}} adequacy and appropriateness of client balances. The analytical procedure process consists of auditors creating independent account expectations and corroborating unusual fluctuations through obtaining and evaluating additional audit evidence. Prior analytical procedure {{research has found}} that knowledge of clients' unaudited account balances biases auditors' expectations towards the current year figures. However, this research has failed to examine the impact of biased expectations on the subsequent stages of analytical procedures. This dissertation assesses the full impact of biased account expectations on auditors' use of analytical procedures. I experimentally test the hypotheses of my dissertation through administering an experiment to senior level auditors. After inducing an account expectation bias that favors the client account balance in half the participants, I examine the auditors' cognitive investigation into an unusual account fluctuation. The results indicate that a biased account expectation negatively affects auditors' judgment quality. In particular, a biased expectation leads auditors to favor hypotheses and additional information that supports the proposition that the client's balance is reasonably stated. Alternatively, auditors with unbiased account expectations are more willing to consider all hypotheses and are able to identify the most pertinent additional information to the decision task. As a result of the different decision strategies employed, auditors who form unbiased account expectations are significantly more likely than auditors with biased account expectations to identify the correct relationship among the underlying data and the proposed hypotheses during a <b>substantive</b> analytical <b>procedure...</b>|$|R

40|$|Designing and {{carrying}} out effective and valid research are the desired goals of all research-ers, and demonstrating the trustworthiness of one’s dissertation research {{is a requirement}} for all doctoral candidates. For qualitative researchers, reaching the desired goal and meeting the requirement of trustworthiness become particularly problematic due to the considerable debate {{about what it means}} to do valid research in the field of qualitative inquiry. This article reviews the various approaches to the validity problem in the hope of turning this debate into a dialogue. Validity is traced from its origins in the realist ontology and foundational episte-mology of quantitative inquiry to its reformulations within the lifeworld ontology and non-foundationalism of interpretive human inquiry. Various recent qualitative approaches to validity are considered, and interpretive reconfigurations of validity are reviewed. Interpre-tive approaches to validity are synthesized as ethical and <b>substantive</b> <b>procedures</b> of validation. Until recently in the social sciences, the issue of how we arrive at valid knowl-edge has involved a debate between the proponents of quantitative proce-dures and those who preferred a qualitative approach. For a time, qualitative meth-ods were accepted only as an exploratory approach to inquiry that required further validation by quantitative methods (Leininger, 1992). Presently, there seems to be at least tacit agreement that some aspects of human experience cannot be understood through reductionistic measures (Giorgio, 1992; Mishler, 1990). The major debate now hinges on the issue of validity. Proponents of positivist quantitative research regularly imply that qualitative, especially interpretivist, approaches to human inquiry are so rife with threats to validity that they are of no scientific value. In the debate over legitimacy, the validity of qualitative research findings has become “the most controversial issue ” (Bailey, 1997, p. 21).

40|$|Audit {{evidence}} {{enables the}} auditor to express {{an opinion on}} the financial statements. To address {{the risk that the}} auditor may express an inappropriate opinion, the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures must be responsive to the assessed risks of material misstatement. The auditor must aggregate the levels of assurance obtained from different combinations of tests of controls, <b>substantive</b> analytical <b>procedures</b> and tests of details to respond to the assessed risks. These evidence planning decisions are complex and require professional judgement. Research has found that the extent of audit procedures is not linked to the assessed risks and that auditors may not know to aggregate evidence from different types of audit procedures. Research also supports the use of a structured audit methodology that includes decision models, to guide the application of professional judgement. This leads to the overall objective of this study: the development of an integrated audit evidence planning model to quantify the extent of audit evidence. The study employs a grounded theory model building approach, interpreting the relevant concepts and principles from the literature review into the development of the model. The integrated audit evidence planning model quantitatively relates the extent of audit evidence in a logical and structured manner with the risk assessment and three distinct overall levels of assurance needed to support the audit opinion. It uses the cumulative nature of audit evidence and the compensatory inter-relationship between tests of controls, <b>substantive</b> analytical <b>procedures</b> and tests of details to quantitatively aggregate the extent and levels of assurance from the different combinations of procedures to obtain reasonable assurance at the required overall level of assurance. The model provides a framework for influencing and guiding the exercise of professional judgement and is a practical and effective tool to benefit the users thereof when conducting an audit. Thus, the study models the extent of audit evidence with reference to the aggregation of different types and combinations of evidence and the linkage between the risk assessment and the extent of evidence that provides a flexible framework for the application of professional judgement regarding the gathering of audit evidence.

Further, this research uses the heuristic systematic model to hypothesize that auditors who disaggregate will remain more likely to obtain evidence even when the client is credible.
