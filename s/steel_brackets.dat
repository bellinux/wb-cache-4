40|$|Abstract: This paper {{synthetically}} analyzed essential {{features of}} various support methods in engineering geological soft rock, proposed a scheme that organically combines active support(like anchor bolt support) with passive support (like U-shaped <b>steel</b> <b>bracket</b> support), analyzed fundamentals of this combined support scheme, and forecasted support {{effect of this}} support scheme. It provides roadway support design with fresh ideas. U-shaped <b>steel</b> <b>bracket</b> can be translated into special anchor plate {{with the help of}} a section of simple steel channel beam, so effect of anchor bolt can be ensured; U-shaped <b>steel</b> <b>bracket,</b> this extremely long curved beam,will be divided into several sections of short beams, so its bearing ability will be several times improved. Cost of this combined support scheme is low, its process is simple and its application prospect is wide. 1 Engineering geological features of soft rock At present, soft rock that scholars are talking about is the “engineering soft rock”, that is, the engineering rock which will have a significant plastic deformation under the actions of engineering forces. Engineering soft rock is divided into four categories: expansive soft rock (or low-pressure soft rock), high-stress soft rock, fractured soft rock and composite soft rock...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the frictional resistance generated by conventional stainless <b>steel,</b> radiance ceramic <b>bracket,</b> self-ligating and composite brackets using a 0. 019 × 0. 025 stainless steel straight length wires in a 022 slot and to select brackets based on their frictional characteristic. Methodology: In order to conduct this study, four different types of bracket system were selected of the mclaughlin-bennet-trevesi (MBT) discipline. They are Group 1 - stainless steel, Group 2 - composite bracket Group 3 - (American Orthodontics) radiance ceramic bracket Group 4 - self-ligating bracket (SLB) (Empower). In this study, five maxillary brackets of an arch of each type were used. All brackets are 0. 022 × 0. 028 " in preadjusted edgewise appliance which simulates the dental arch. Five brackets were bonded to a stainless steel bar of dimension 150 mm × 25 mm × 3 mm. The bracket-arch wire units were submitted to mechanical test with an Instron universal testing machine 3365. A testing apparatus or holding jig was designed to hold the bracket during the mechanical test. Each sample was pulled at a speed of 6 mm for 1 min. Descriptive statistical information including mean and standard deviation of maximum friction force was calculated for each bracket wire combination.

30|$|Rockburst {{ultimately}} {{leads to}} the sudden violent dynamic failures of roadway or coalface, of which 87  % (Pan et al. 2013) occurs in the roadway. Therefore, it is of direct significance for the control of rockburst by inhibiting the failure of roadway and coalface through support means. As for rockburst-resisting roadways, the support system should be capable of resisting high burst dynamics, providing appropriate pressure yielding deformation, and owning a flexibility that can play a buffering and energy-absorbing role (Gao et al. 2009). Bolt has become a reasonable supporting mean due to its initiative, pressure yielding ability, energy absorbing ability, and the capability in utilizing the bearing capacity of surrounding rocks (Gao et al. 2009; He et al. 2010). However, bolt support technology can only resist the rockburst under certain intensity. As for high-energy rockburst, energy absorbing materials are needed to consume part of the tremor energy to stabilize the support system (Lv et al. 2011). On this basis, Pan and Lv et al. (Pan et al. 2011; Lv and Pan 2012) proposed a structure model of rigid-flexible energy-absorbing support which was composed of surrounding rocks, energy absorbing materials, and <b>steel</b> <b>bracket</b> (rigid-flexible-rigid). In essence, the model {{is similar to the}} strong–soft–strong structure model (Gao et al. 2008). The surrounding rocks, energy absorbing materials, and <b>steel</b> <b>bracket</b> are equivalent to the externally strong large structure, middle soft structure, internally strong small structure respectively. Theoretically basing on the model above, the rigid-flexible energy-absorbing support system (Liu et al. 2013) was developed. It is a three-level support system composed of three parts, namely, the bolt-mesh-cable support, the O-type roof support made of energy absorbing materials and U-type steels (simply called as O-type roof support), and the rigid burst-resisting bracket. The energy absorbing materials lay between the bolt-mesh-cable support and O-type roof support. This support system was implemented in Yuejin Coal Mine of Henan Dayou Energy Co., Ltd., China, and effectively avoided roadway damages, equipment damages, and casualties when high-energy rockburst occurred.|$|R

50|$|To avoid {{weakening}} the frame by {{mortise and tenon}} joints between the longitudinal members and the struts, the latter abutted against the former and were {{held in place by}} right-angled <b>steel</b> <b>brackets,</b> which were bound to the wooden members by strips of Irish linen tape soaked in glue, the glue still being wet when the tape was bound, setting in situ. The corners of the angle brackets were indented at the apex to provide room for a steel pin and also provided with a horizontal slot across the corner, so that a bracing wire could pass through the slot and around the pin, enabling a simple, secure and easily replaceable mounting for the bracing wires which kept the frame in shape. Each of the corners of each triangular set of struts was braced to the diagonally opposite corner of the adjacent set. This method of construction avoided the use of wood-screws, which could eventually become difficult to fix and were often found in other aircraft to damage the members they were intended to strengthen.|$|E

50|$|The bolster springs are {{supported}} on a lower spring beam. The lower spring beam is a fabricated structure {{made of steel}} plates. It is trapezoidal in shape with small steel tubes on each end. The location of the bolster spring seating is marked by two circular grooves in the center. A rubber washer is placed at the grooved section. The bolster spring sits on the rubber washer. The lower spring beam is also a free-floating structure. It is not bolted or welded either to the bogie frame or the bogie bolster. It {{is attached to the}} bogie frame on the outside {{with the help of a}} steel hanger. They are traditionally called the BSS Hangers (Bogie Secondary Suspension Hangers). A BSS pin is placed in the tubular section in the end portion of the lower spring beam. A hanger block is placed below the BSS pin. The BSS hanger in turn supports the hanger. This arrangement is done on all the four corners of the lower spring beam. The top end of the hanger also has a similar arrangement. However, instead of the BSS pin, <b>steel</b> <b>brackets</b> are welded on the lower side of the bogie frame of which the BSS hanger hangs with the help of hanger block. This arrangement is same for all the four top corners of the hangers. Hence, the lower spring beam also become a floating member hinged to the bogie frame with the help of hangers on the top and the bottom. This allows for the longitudinal movement of the lower spring beam.|$|E

A small number of timber components were replaced after the 1999 move when the tower was damaged, and some <b>steel</b> <b>bracket</b> work was installed.

30|$|The bond {{strength}} between an orthodontic bracket and a laminate veneer should {{be sufficient to}} withstand the forces generated by mastication, last the duration of orthodontic treatment but allow straightforward removal {{at the end of}} treatment without damage to the underlying restoration. The minimum {{bond strength}} for orthodontic purposes falls within the range of 6 to 8 MPa [19]. It has also been reported that the minimum bond strength needed by a stainless <b>steel</b> <b>bracket</b> to be clinically acceptable is 2.86 MPa [32]. In the present study, bond strengths for brackets bonded to composite laminate surfaces pre-treated with both diamond bur and microetcher lie approximately within this acceptable range, being higher than the former. However, significantly high bond strength between the adhesive resin and a restoration has disadvantages. Fracture or loss of the underlying restoration during debonding can occur. Additionally, sandblasting with aluminum oxide particles (microetcher) may be safer than utilizing burs or stones, since the procedure is more uniform and less aggressive [33].|$|R
