5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three <b>staging</b> <b>systems</b> for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{clinical}} <b>staging</b> <b>systems</b> {{are used}} to classify HIV and HIV-related disease for surveillance purposes: the WHO disease staging system for HIV infection and disease, and the CDC classification system for HIV infection.

40|$|AbstractStaging {{systems for}} {{multiple}} myeloma (MM) include the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) <b>staging</b> <b>system,</b> the International <b>Staging</b> <b>System</b> (ISS), and the Durie-Salmon (DS) <b>staging</b> <b>system.</b> We evaluated whether staging {{at the time}} of diagnosis could predict survival in MM patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT) as first-line treatment. Between November 1996 and June 2005, 152 MM patients were treated with induction VAD (vincristine, adriamycin, dexamethasone) chemotherapy, followed by APBSCT at 6 institutions in Korea. Median follow-up times were 22. 6 months (range, 5. 4 - 101. 9 months) from the day of diagnosis and 14. 1 months (range, 0. 4 - 96. 1 months) from the day of APBSCT. Progression-free survival (PFS) from the day of diagnosis was predicted by the SWOG <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> (P =. 0129) and ISS (P =. 0299), but not by the DS <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> at diagnosis (P =. 1074). In addition, overall survival (OS) from the day of diagnosis could be predicted by the SWOG <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> (P =. 0207) and ISS (P =. 0105), but not by the DS <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> (P =. 2542). PFS from day of APBSCT was not predicted by the DS <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> (P =. 5731), SWOG <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> (P =. 2817), or ISS (P =. 1167). OS from day of APBSCT could be predicted by the SWOG <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> (P =. 0392) and ISS (P =. 0198), but not by the DS <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> (P =. 5426). Our findings indicate that PFS and OS in association with APBSCT can be predicted by stages assessed by the SWOG and ISS systems, but not by the DS <b>system.</b> Moreover, <b>staging</b> by the SWOG and ISS systems {{at the time of}} diagnosis was better correlated with survival than was staging at the time of APBSCT...|$|R

2500|$|When {{tumor cells}} metastasize, the new tumor {{is called a}} {{secondary}} or metastatic tumor, and its cells {{are similar to those}} in the original or primary tumor. This means that if breast cancer metastasizes to the lungs, the secondary tumor is made up of abnormal breast cells, not of abnormal lung cells. The tumor in the lung is then called metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer. [...] Metastasis is a key element in cancer <b>staging</b> <b>systems</b> such as the TNM staging system, where it represents the [...] "M". [...] In overall stage grouping, metastasis places a cancer in Stage IV. [...] The possibilities of curative treatment are greatly reduced, or often entirely removed, when a cancer has metastasized.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Over {{the past}} decades, {{many studies have}} used data mining {{technology}} to predict the 5 -year survival rate of colorectal cancer, {{but there have been}} few reports that compared multiple data mining algorithms to the TNM classification of malignant tumors (TNM) <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> using a dataset in which the training and testing data were from different sources. Here we compared nine data mining algorithms to the TNM <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> for colorectal survival analysis. Methods: Two different datasets were used: 1) the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results dataset; and 2) the dataset from a single Chinese institution. An optimization and prediction system based on nine data mining algorithms as well as two variable selection methods was implemented. The TNM <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> was based on the 7 th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM <b>staging</b> <b>system.</b> Results: When the training and testing data were from the same sources, all algorithms had slight advantages over the TNM <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> in predictive accuracy. When the data were from different sources, only four algorithms (logistic regression, general regression neural network, Bayesian networks, and Naı̈ve Bayes) had slight advantages over the TNM <b>staging</b> <b>system.</b> Also, there was no significant differences among all the algorithms (p. 0. 05). Conclusions: The TNM <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> is simple and practical at present, and data mining methods are not accurate enough to replace the TNM <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> for colorectal cancer survival prediction.

40|$|Introduction:Thirty {{years have}} gone by since the Masaoka <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> of thymoma was {{proposed}} in 1981. Although the Masaoka <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> has been accepted by many surgeons and pathologists, some proposals of revision and improvements have been suggested. At this time, I reinvestigated the Masaoka <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> based on the recent follow-up study of the thymomas resected at Nagoya City University. Methods:Using the follow-up results of 211 thymomas in Nagoya, I analyzed the following aspects: (1) evaluation of the Masaoka <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> as a prognostic factor in the Nagoya series and (2) critical assessment of the proposals of revision to the Masaoka <b>staging</b> <b>system.</b> Results:(1) Univariate analysis showed that Masaoka stages were significantly prognostic for overall survival (p < 0. 0001). (2) The difference of survivals between stage I and II was not significant, but progression-free survival of stage I was 100 % for up to 20 years, whereas one tumor death case in stage II was found. (3) Differences of survival between the cases with and without great vessel invasion in stage III were not significant. (4) Prognosis of N+ tumors was yet better defined. Conclusion:(1) The Masaoka <b>staging</b> <b>system</b> remains a valuable prognostic factor. (2) Combination of stage I with II and separation of stage III into subgroups are not recommended.
