5|$|On June 22, 2010, {{the town}} of Lyndhurst put forward a {{proposal}} to buy the station depots at both Kingsland and Lyndhurst stations. The mayor of Lyndhurst, Richard DiLascio, said that the stations have <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> days and New Jersey Transit {{has no interest in}} renovating both buildings. Design plans for Kingsland station look towards a new coffee shop, after repairing and renovating the building. The station would also be converted from its old subway tile to a newer retro look for the building, paid for by leasing the building. Because an average of 440 to over 1,000 people use the Kingsland station daily, it would look better for {{the town of}} Lyndhurst to make a good impression on the riders. Asof 2012, the station house was unoccupied. The town of Lyndhurst has requested that NJT lease the building to the municipality so that it might be renovated and brought into use as a way to revitalize the immediate vicinity.|$|E
25|$|Federal Actions {{to address}} the disproportionate health and {{environmental}} disparities that minority and low-income populations face through Executive Order (E.O) 12898, required federal agencies to make environmental justice central to their programs and policies. Superfund sites {{have been shown to}} impact minority communities the most. Despite legislation specifically designed to ensure equity in Superfund listing, marginalized populations still experience a lesser chance of successful listing and cleanup than areas with higher income levels. After the executive order had been put in place, there persisted a discrepancy between the demographics of the communities living near toxic waste sites and their listing as Superfund sites, which would otherwise grant them federally funded cleanup projects. Communities with both increased minority and low-income populations were found to have lowered their chances of site listing after the executive order, while on the other hand, increases in income led to greater chances of site listing. Of the populations living within 1 mile radius of a Superfund site, 44% of those are minorities despite only being around 37% of the nation's population. It has also been shown that the government responds slower to community demands from minority communities than from white communities. Superfund sites near white communities have <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> clean up and harsher penalties for the polluters than minority communities.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the episode was pitched by Simpsons writer Ron Hauge, who {{thought it would be}} {{interesting}} to see an episode in which Bart would run into a retired Western film star in the neighborhood and [...] "think he was the coolest guy in the world", although the actor had <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> days. Hauge suggested that Swartzwelder, who is an avid Western fan, would be the appropriate writer for the episode. Swartzwelder also pitched the plot idea about the angry dog who chases Bart in the episode.|$|E

500|$|There is a sharp {{contrast}} between Fink's living quarters and the polished, pristine environs of Hollywood, especially the home of Jack Lipnick. The spooky, inexplicably empty feel of the Hotel Earle was central to the Coens' conception of the movie. [...] "We wanted an art deco stylization", Joel explained in a 1991 interview, [...] "and {{a place that was}} falling into ruin after having <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> days". Barton's room is sparsely furnished with two large windows facing another building. The Coens later described the hotel as a [...] "ghost ship floating adrift, where you notice signs of the presence of other passengers, without ever laying eyes on any". In the movie, residents' shoes are an indication of this unseen presence; another rare sign of other inhabitants is the sound from adjacent rooms. Joel said: [...] "You can imagine it peopled by failed commercial travelers, with pathetic sex lives, who cry alone in their rooms".|$|E
2500|$|The Muppet Theater is {{the setting}} for The Muppet Show, a grand old {{vaudeville}} house that has <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> days. In episode 106, Kermit identifies {{the name of the}} theatre as The Benny Vandergast Memorial Theater, although by the time of It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie, it is simply called [...] "The Muppet Theater." [...] It is then that the theatre becomes registered as a historical landmark.|$|E
2500|$|As was {{the case}} with the 93rd Division, the 92nd fought {{primarily}} in French sectors, since American and British senior commanders did not want these segregated units fighting in proximity to organizations composed of white soldiers. [...] Despite his success at leading black troops in combat, Hay expressed a low opinion of African-American soldiers, and argued against allowing them to attend officer training or serve in leadership roles. [...] In contrast to this opinion, Hay also praised African-American soldiers on other occasions, once writing [...] "I have been with colored troops for 25 years, and I have never <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> soldiers than the drafted men who composed this division (The 92nd)." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{television}} series Green Acres episode “Lisa's Mudder Comes for a Visit” (season 5 episode 1), Lisa {{and her mother}} converse in Hungarian, with English Subtitles. [...] First, Lisa looks down and corrects the subtitles, “No no no, I said you hadn't changed a bit! We {{have a lot of}} trouble here with subtitles.”, and they change. [...] Mother's Japanese chauffeur asks “I begga pardon – I bringa bags inna house?” that elicits a gong sound and Japanese subtitles. This is followed by Mother’s great Dane barking with the subtitles “I've <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> doghouses than this” with Lisa responding “We're not interested in what the dog says”, and the subtitles disappear. Later, the subtitles ask farmhand Eb if they will be needing any more subtitles for the episode.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{pairing of}} Neagle and Wilding in the [...] "London Films", as {{the series of}} films came to be called, was in Spring in Park Lane (1948). A drama, this {{depicted}} the romance between a millionaire's niece and a footman (actually a nobleman who has <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> days). The script was written by Nicholas Phipps, who also played Wilding's brother. Although not a musical, it contains a dream sequence featuring the song [...] "The Moment I Saw You". Spring in Park Lane was the 1949 Picturegoer winner for Best Film, Actor and Actress. Neagle and Wilding were together for a fourth time in the Technicolor romance Maytime in Mayfair (1949). The plot is reminiscent of Roberta, as it had Wilding inheriting a dress shop owned by Neagle.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the surface}} of Bornholm older [...] {{formations}} can be <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> than {{in the rest of}} Denmark. Stubbeløkken - which is still operating (Danish i drift) - and Klippeløkken granite quarries in [...] just east of central Rønne - and statistically a part of the town - are among the few remaining quarries of what was once many active quarries on the island. The island's varied geography and seascapes attract visitors to its many beauty spots from the Hammeren promontory in the northwest to the Almindingen forest in the centre and the Dueodde beaches in the southeast. Of special interest are the rocky sea cliffs at Jons Kapel and Helligdomsklipperne, the varied topography of Paradisbakkerne and rift valleys such as Ekkodalen and Døndalen. Bornholm's numerous windmills include the post mill of Egeby and the well-kept Dutch mill at Aarsdale. The lighthouse at Dueodde is Denmark's tallest, while Hammeren Lighthouse stands at a height of [...] above sea level and Rønne Lighthouse rises over the waterfront.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in the principality, Maroto took charge of an army of less than 11,000 men, whose instruction, if one may call it that, left much to be desired. On September 7, Maroto began the siege of Prats de Lluçanès, which {{he was forced to}} abandon owing to the defeat of the forces that tried to prevent the arrival of a column of assistance. He did not allow himself to be discouraged by this and dedicated the following days to instructing the battalions under his orders, [...] "and established in them such rigorous discipline in eight days… that one would not have <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> in the vanguard division formed later by the Count of Spain'". However, on October 4 his second in command, the Baron of Ortafá was defeated and he died in San Quirico in an action whose result was attributed by the Catalans to his not having been assisted in a timely manner by Maroto.|$|E
2500|$|Sackville Street prospered in the 1800s, {{though an}} {{invisible}} boundary {{seems to have}} been maintained for some time between the Upper and Lower street. As planned, Lower Sackville Street became highly successful as a commercial location; its terraces ambitiously lined with purpose-designed retail units, one of the first schemes of its kind in Europe. By contrast the northern end proved not to be as successful initially; being exposed to the commercial activity of the lower street, it lost its fashionability as a quiet enclave of grand townhouses, whilst also being too far away from the commercial core of the city to stand as a strong retail location. As a result, a difference between the two ends of the street developed: the planned lower end successful and bustling next to the river, and the upper end featuring a mixture of less prominent businesses and old townhouses, some converted for commercial use and growing somewhat decrepit. Upon his visit to Dublin in 1845, William Makepeace Thackeray observed: [...] "The street is exceedingly broad and handsome; the shops at the commencement, rich and spacious; but in Upper Sackville Street, which closes with the pretty building and gardens of the Rotunda, the appearance of wealth begins to fade somewhat, and the houses look as if they had <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> days. Even in this, the great street of the town, there is scarcely any one, and it is as vacant and listless as Pall Mall in October." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hancock {{spent the}} 1995 summer {{off-season}} working on expanding his offensive prowess, {{which appeared to}} have some effect on his game during a surprising pre-season start where he averaged 15.5 points over six exhibition games. [...] Starter Scott Burrell entered the season {{on the injured list}} nursing a torn Achilles tendon, forcing the newly acquired shooting guard Glen Rice to switch positions and replace Burrell as the squad's starting small forward. Charlotte took a chance with tapping Hancock to temporarily fill the void at the starting shooting guard position in the meantime. He appeared in four starts during the middle of November, averaging five points and two rebounds. However Burrell returned to the starting lineup later in the month, relegating Hancock back to the bench. [...] Darrin Hancock saw limited playing time in about half of all regular season games through the end of December [...] but recorded an NBA career high of 16 points during an away game against the Utah Jazz. The now second-year NBA swingman began to see a dramatic increase in playing time after Burrell suffered a season-ending dislocated shoulder on New Year's Eve. This time around Charlotte went with Dell Curry as the team's new replacement starting shooting guard, designating Hancock as the Hornets' primary guard-forward swingman reserve. Hancock finished the season with a total average of 13.3 minutes per game in 63 games. Despite seeing more time on the court, Hancock was unable to carry over his pre-season offensive exploits into the regular season and settled instead for a 4.3 points per game average. The Charlotte Hornets, playing their first year without star Alonzo Mourning, had also <b>seen</b> <b>better</b> times after failing to make the playoffs with a 41-41 record. [...] The Hornets decided not to re-sign Hancock {{at the end of his}} two-year contract, making the former Hornet a marketable free agent soon thereafter.|$|E
