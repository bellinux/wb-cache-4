5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the EU {{directive}} 80/181/EEC had required that dual unit labelling of goods sold within the EU cease by the end of 2009. This was backed up by requests from other nations including Japan and New Zealand to permit metric-only labelling as an aid to trade with those countries. Opinion in the United States was split – a bill to permit metric-only labelling at the federal level was to have been introduced in 2005 but significant opposition from the Food Marketing Institute, representing US grocers, has delayed the introduction of the bill. During a routine decennial review of the directive in 2008, the EU postponed the <b>sunset</b> <b>clause</b> for dual units indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sunset</b> <b>clauses</b> are a {{commonly}} used statutory provision {{related to the}} temporary duration of various laws. Such clauses are scattered throughout the statute books. This thesis aims {{to shed light on}} the constitutional value of such clauses, in order to value them {{from the perspective of the}} separation of powers and the rule of law. We have an extant amount of literature on <b>sunset</b> <b>clauses,</b> especially regarding their utility in the United States. In the United Kingdom, we have a limited analysis with respect to specific fields, including emergency legislation. However, we lack a comprehensive analysis with regard to their constitutional value. This thesis’s analysis is conducted in three parts, separated into the historical, the positive, and the normative. All three parts of this thesis are interdependent, and the analysis of each subsequent part builds on the conclusion of its antecedent. The first part investigates the historical development of <b>sunset</b> <b>clauses</b> since the first Parliament in England. The positive analysis examines the contemporary utility of <b>sunset</b> <b>clauses.</b> Finally, the normative evaluation examines their interaction with several models of separation of powers as it values their impact on the rule of law. Depending on the separation of power model, such clauses play a role in the system of checks and balances. On the one hand, they impact the institutional relationship between the executive and legislative branches. On the other hand, they influence the interaction between the legislature and the courts. Although I acknowledge that their legislative use in limiting human rights diminishes the rule of law, they might have the exact opposite effect: on several occasions in the past, they were used to advance the rule of law, including the adoption of innovative legislation and the annulment of the death penalty. Indeed, this thesis attests to the constitutional value of <b>sunset</b> <b>clauses.</b> This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|R

500|$|In 1991, Congress {{enacted the}} Agent Orange Act, giving the Department of Veterans Affairs the {{authority}} to declare certain conditions 'presumptive' to exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin, making these veterans who served in Vietnam eligible to receive treatment and compensation for these conditions. The same law required the National Academy of Sciences to periodically review the science on dioxin and herbicides used in Vietnam to inform the Secretary of Veterans Affairs about {{the strength of the}} scientific evidence showing association between exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin and certain conditions. The authority for the National Academy of Sciences reviews and addition of any new diseases to the presumptive list by the VA is expiring in 2015 under the <b>sunset</b> <b>clause</b> of the Agent Orange Act of 1991. [...] Through this process, the list of 'presumptive' conditions has grown since 1991, and currently the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has listed prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, multiple myeloma, type II diabetes mellitus, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma, chloracne, porphyria cutanea tarda, peripheral neuropathy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange as conditions associated with exposure to the herbicide. This list now includes B cell leukemias, such as hairy cell leukemia, Parkinson's disease and ischemic heart disease, these last three having been added on August 31, 2010.

2500|$|Between 2001 and 2003, the Bush {{administration}} {{instituted a}} federal {{tax cut for}} all taxpayers.

2500|$|Paul was {{the only}} 2008 Republican presidential {{candidate}} {{who voted against the}} Iraq War Resolution in 2002, and he opposed the U.S. presence in Iraq, charging the government with using the War on Terror to curtail civil liberties. He believes a just declaration of war after the September 11, 2001, attacks should have been directed against the actual terrorists, Al-Qaeda, rather than against Iraq, which has not been linked to the attacks. In 2003, Paul said that when America seeks war, it must be sought only to protect citizens, it must be declared by the U.S. Congress, and it must be concluded when the victory is complete as previously planned, which would allow all resources to be dedicated to victory; he added, [...] "The American public deserves clear goals and a definite exit strategy in Iraq." [...] However, the original authorization to invade Iraq (Public Law 107-243), passed in late 2002, authorized the president to use military force against Iraq to achieve only the following two specific objectives: [...] "(1) defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and (2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq". Accordingly, Paul introduced legislation to add a <b>sunset</b> <b>clause</b> to the original authorization.|$|E

After covering the main forms that such provisions can adopt, it first considers three legitimacy gains of constitutionalising them. It then explores two legitimacy concerns that so doing raises. Given that constitutions are difficult to amend, constitutionalisation may threaten future generations' sovereignty. And it may also make the constitution's content impossible to adapt to changing circumstances and interests. Finally, the paper {{examines the}} ways in which such concerns may be addressed at the adoption, formulation, and amendment stages. In particular, it discusses if the use of <b>sunset</b> <b>clauses</b> and regular constitutional conventions may, and under what conditions, successfully address such concerns...|$|R

Even though the rhetoric towards the 'war on terror' may have changed under the Brown administration, attempts to extend {{the powers of the}} state in the security domain have persisted, for example, by the proposed introduction of ID cards and extensions of detention without charge. Despite rebellions, the executive invariably benefits from majority control in the House of Commons, control over business, time, information, and a sometimes compliant Conservative opposition. However, there have been both procedural concessions (for example, committee scrutiny of the PM, and rights to debate and vote on war) and policy concessions (<b>sunset</b> <b>clauses,</b> and reduced days' detention without charge). While the House of Lords has arguably been more successful in gaining policy concessions, analysis over time reveals that concessions are temporary and if the executive wants its way it will use its advantages to try again...|$|R
40|$|The "ladder of investment" is a {{regulatory}} approach proposed by Cave (2006), {{which has been}} widely embraced by national regulatory authorities in the European telecommunications sector.

2500|$|According to a 2003 Treasury study, the {{tax cuts}} in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 {{resulted}} in a significant decline in revenue relative to a baseline without the cuts, approximately $111 billion (in 1992 dollars) on average during {{the first four years}} after implementation or nearly 3% GDP annually.

[...] The fact that tax receipts as a percentage of GDP fell following the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 shows a decrease in tax burden as share of GDP and a commensurate increase in the deficit, as spending did not fall relative to GDP.

It contains a provision that allows any one of seven countries to terminate its key components. This provision – which this Comment terms a trigger termination – is both unusual and important. It is unusual because, up to now, the Security Council has almost always either not specified {{the conditions under which}} resolutions terminate or used time-based <b>sunset</b> <b>clauses.</b> It is important not only for the Iran deal, but also as a precedent and a model for the use of trigger terminations in the future. The political and legal dimensions of trigger terminations are striking. As to political dimensions, this Comment shows that by providing for the termination of resolutions, trigger terminations can influence the bargaining surrounding the creation and implementation of resolutions. As to legal dimensions, this Comment analyzes trigger terminations in light of the broader literature on the Security Council’s power to delegate authority and defends their legality within wide boundaries. Overall, this Comment argues that trigger terminations hold considerable promise but also some peril for the future...|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{reconciliation}} bill may cover {{as many as}} ten years, the fifth provision can {{have the effect of}} requiring that any tax cut or spending increase be approved by a three-fifths majority, or else the law must return to its previous state after ten years. This is responsible for the use of <b>sunset</b> <b>clauses</b> in several recent budget acts, when proposed tax cuts commanded majority support but not the necessary three-fifths majority to suspend the Byrd Rule. For example, many of the provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 would have expired as soon as fiscal year 2010 if not extended. The provisions that were to expire included the $1000 per child tax credit, the 10% income tax bracket for low-income workers, and the deduction for state and local sales taxes paid. The expiration dates in those Acts were inserted in order to avoid Byrd Rule points of order.

30|$|The {{tendency}} {{for the public}} sector to be somewhat “flat-footed” in regulation has several causes but a major factor is its tendency to be risk-averse. Because regulation takes time to develop and implement, let alone revise, legislators often lag behind the events they are attempting to manage and resist pressure to “hurry legislation through”. This norm is being resisted by some who advocate <b>sunset</b> <b>clauses</b> and, more generally, “experimental legislation” [41]. In summary, there are various ways in which law can be enacted relatively quickly and with an in-built ability to revise or withdraw it if it is found not to be delivering the desired outcome. In the context of Uber-like phenomena, unforeseen external developments may provide legislators with a justification for making such revisions. Posen proposes the use of time-limited experimental regulation to support user safety in particular: “the regulations should take on a flexible, experimental nature until {{the contours of the}} market are more fully developed” ([38], p. 329). The thinking is that this approach will allow all parties to learn what does and does not work on the way to setting permanent regulations at a future stage. Of course, this is easily said but may be difficult to realise. Uber, however, may have resisted somewhat less fiercely certain measures taken against it had they been explicitly experimental.|$|R

40|$|Rarely has {{a country}} so divided {{political}} analysts as contemporary South Africa. Ever since R. W. Johnson famously enquired ‘How long will South Africa survive?’ 1, {{a procession of}} doom-mongers has viewed its political trajectory through the lenses of post-colonial African decline, seeing its carefully managed ‘transition to democracy’ as just one more step {{along the road to}} civil war, rampant tribalism, and a one-party state. Well-wishers saw the new South Africa through quite different eyes, as a rainbow-coloured adventure bus unshackled by the ‘miracle’ of transition from the economic and social chains of apartheid. Many of its supporters even saw the African National Congress (ANC) as the glorious locomotive of continental renaissance, pulling its peoples into the African century. The calm Mandela presidency exposed 1994 ’s spectres of tribalism, ungovernability, and civil war as the creations of political leaders striving, in the heat of negotiation, to represent their constituents as inconsolable. The mobilisation of Zulu ethnicity proved to be an epiphenomenon of transition, and new stereotypes of the patient masses supplanted whites’ lurid fantasies of the ungovernable youth. The ANC’s qualified alliance with de Klerk’s National Party rapidly proved a luxury, as the great Afrikaner institutions - the defence force, state bureaucracies, parastatals, and Afrikaans-medium universities - were neutralised cheaply and easily through pension guarantees, <b>sunset</b> <b>clauses,</b> and endlessly deferred rationalisation...|$|R
40|$|Like many, Michael Ignatieff and Smaw {{recognize}} that balancing {{civil liberties and}} national security in times of emergency is a necessity {{if we are to}} survive onslaughts from terrorist organizations. Ignatieff, however, argues for infringing upon the liberties of some in order to preserve the liberties of others. In such cases, he concludes we ought only to infringe upon civil liberties in light of adversarial review, placing strict limitations on our actions, using <b>sunset</b> <b>clauses,</b> and fully accepting that our actions will sometimes result in immoral behavior. By contrast, Smaw finds Ignatieff’s approach to be problematic because it fails to take seriously important substantive measures for achieving justice in times of emergency. Smaw concludes that Ignatieff’s procedural measures coupled with the substantive measures of truthfulness, faithfulness, and solidarity result in a superior policy for balancing civil liberties and national security in times of emergency because they ensure the cases of those accused of wrongdoing meet the pedigree tests for procedural and substantive justice, even in times of emergency. In response to Ignatieff and Smaw, I show that it is crucial to understand the differences between past and present terrorist organizations. Otherwise we cannot effectively institute counter-terror procedures. Moreover, I conclude that any effective counter-terror method must entail a proper balance between national security and civil liberties.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the difficulties {{associated with the}} implementation of the regulatory goal of promoting investment and innovation within the area of sector specific regulation in telecoms. The encouragement of efficient investment {{is one of the major}} goals reflected in the EC and domestic legal rules on telecoms access as well as price- and rate of return regulation. The law and the interplay of the interests of incumbents and alternative operators create a fertile soil for the emergence of various regulatory concepts of stimulating investment and facility-based competition. Considered here are the concepts most frequently referred to in this context including: the notion of new and emerging markets, the ladder of investment theory, <b>sunset</b> <b>clauses</b> and dynamic pricing policies. However, most of these concepts had little influence on regulatory practice so far, seeing as telecoms regulation is mostly directed at service competition and effective utilisation of existing infrastructures. This fact is the result of national regulators balancing their various regulatory goals in the existing technical and economic environment of the sector. The approach of the Polish regulatory authority towards these concepts constitutes an example of this reality. The urgent need to establish a new policy for next generation networks and access, bringing new technologies and business models to the sector, will have to induce more recognition for some concepts presented in this article. ...|$|R
