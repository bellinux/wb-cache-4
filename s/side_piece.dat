The {{reader will}} observe that I call the arch mid-cusped, {{not when the}} cusped point {{is in the middle}} of the curve of the arch, but when it {{is in the middle of}} the <b>side</b> <b>piece,</b> and also that where the side pieces join the {{keystone}} there will be a change, perhaps somewhat abrupt, in the curvature.|$|E

60|$|I have {{preferred}} to call the arch mid-cusped with respect to its <b>side</b> <b>piece</b> than with respect to its own curve, because the most beautiful Gothic arches in the world, those of the Lombard Gothic, have, in all the instances I have examined, a form more or less approximating to this mid-cusped one at i (Plate III.), but having the curvature of the cusp carried up into the keystone, {{as we shall see}} presently: where, however, the arch is built of many voussoirs, a mid-cusped arch will mean one which has the point of the cusp midway between its own base and apex.|$|E
60|$|I have no doubt, from {{observation}} {{of the way the}} windows are set together, that the <b>side</b> <b>pieces</b> were carved in pairs, like hooks, of which the keystones were to be the eyes; that these <b>side</b> <b>pieces</b> were ordered by the architect in the gross, and were used by him sometimes for wider, sometimes for narrower windows; bevelling the two ends as required, fitting in keystones as he best could, and now and then varying the arrangement by turning the <b>side</b> <b>pieces</b> upside down.|$|R

Intermediate layers made of electrically non-conductive material are arranged between the <b>side</b> <b>pieces,</b> where the non-conductive material consists of ceramic, glass, quartz, porcelain, plastic, synthetic resin, mortar, enamel, aerosol or mica. The <b>side</b> <b>pieces</b> are thermally parallel and electrically connected in series by the contact layer using galvanotechnic. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for manufacturing a thermoelectric component. USE - Used for cooling and/or heating interior and/or exterior of a pipe, and for measuring a direct measured variable e. g. temperature, and indirect measured variable e. g. specific heat, heat conductivity, heat capacity, pressure, flow rate and reaction energy. Can also be utilized directly or indirectly for storage of data. ADVANTAGE - The individual n and p conductor <b>side</b> <b>pieces</b> are electrically connected by galvanotechnic, thus allowing the contact material to be directly attached on the <b>side</b> <b>pieces,</b> which are provided with detention layers and diffusion barriers, and hence enabling a contact between the pieces without a soldering process...|$|R

6000|$|... § XXI. One step more: I take a mid-cusped <b>side</b> <b>piece</b> in its {{block form}} at t, with the bricks which load {{the back of}} it. Now, as these bricks support it behind, and since, {{as far as the}} use of the cusp is concerned, it matters not whether its weight be in marble or bricks, there is nothing to hinder us from cutting out some of the marble, as at u, and filling up the space with bricks. (Why we should take a fancy to do this, I do not pretend to guess at present; all I have to assert is, that, if the fancy should strike us, there would be no harm in it). Substituting this <b>side</b> <b>piece</b> for the other in the window n, we have that at w, which may, perhaps, be of some service to us afterwards; here we have nothing more to do with it than to note that, thus built, and {{properly}} backed by brickwork, it is just as strong and safe a form as that at n; but that this, as well as every variety of ogee arch, depends entirely for its safety, fitness, and beauty, on the masonry which we have just analysed; and that, built on a large scale, and with many voussoirs, all such arches would be unsafe and absurd in general architecture. Yet they may be used occasionally {{for the sake of the}} exquisite beauty of which their rich and fantastic varieties admit, and sometimes for the sake of another merit, exactly the opposite of the constructional ones we are at present examining, that they seem to stand by enchantment.|$|E

After the shell has rested for a week in the block, the block is removed and the brim (made of several layers of goss to give it strength) is attached to the crown. The shell is coated with a layer of shellac varnish and also left for a further week. The silk plush is then cut to the correct pattern. The top and side pieces are sewn together; the <b>side</b> <b>piece</b> having an open diagonal seam. It is then eased over the shell carefully and then ironed (the heat of the iron melting the shellac for the plush to stick to it). The upper brim is also covered with a piece of silk plush or with silk petersham (a ribbed silk). The underbrim is covered with merino cloth. After the hat has fully rested, the brim is curled and bound with silk grosgrain ribbon, and a hat band (either silk grosgrain with or without a bow, or a black wool mourning band without a bow) is installed. Finally, the lining and the leather sweatband are carefully hand-stitched in.|$|E

40|$|Rotary engines offer {{higher power}} density, fewer parts and lower {{vibrations}} than conventional reciprocating piston engines. However, rotary engines {{are more difficult}} to seal because of the rotor shape which leads to higher gas leakage and oil consumption resulting in lower efficiency and higher emissions. In order to address this problem, this thesis presents a set of multiscale models to assess rotary engine performances by estimating gas leakage, oil consumption, wear and friction. An oil seal multiscale model is developed to estimate internal oil consumption guided by oil transport visualization experiments carried using a laser-induced fluorescence technique. A finite element beam model is used to predict the clearance between the oil seals and the side housing for each crank angle in the cycle. From seal-housing clearance, oil transport through the oil seals is calculated using a control volume approach. The main mechanism leading to internal oil consumption is outward scraping of the oil seals due to a lack in conformability of the seals to the distorted side housing, especially next to the intake and exhaust ports. A set of multiscale models are developed for the performance of the apex and side seals. The models are formulated to couple gas flow to the dynamics and deformation of the seals while accurately describing the interfaces between the seals and their profile and groove. The models are used to predict apex and side seal behavior and understand the mechanisms leading to gas leakage. The main leakage mechanisms identified are leakage through (1) the corner seal clearance, (2) the spark plug holes, (3) the flanks of the seals at high speed, and (4) the <b>side</b> <b>piece</b> corner for the apex seals and at the ends of the side seals. The apex seal model shows good agreement with experiments, especially for the pressure in the apex seal groove. It is the first time such comprehensive models are developed for rotary engines and they will be valuable tools to help design more efficient and environment-friendly rotary engines. by Mathieu Picard.
