Sulfur mustard is not very <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> water but is very <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat,</b> contributing to its rapid absorption into the skin.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1800 s {{the range of}} {{synthesized}} chemicals has increased dramatically to include pesticides, plastics, hydrocarbon fuels, soaps, detergents and other useful substances. The effects in the environment are result of a sequence of processes that depend on the properties of individual chemical. DDT {{has been the focus}} of a large amount of early research due to its effects on the endocrine system leading to egg shell thinning and reduced breeding in birds. DDT is a member of chlorohydrocarbons, a family of chemically related insecticides. Chlorohydrocarbons are highly toxic to aquatic organisms, persistent, <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and have very low solubility in water. They move from water to animals with a large increase in concentration by a process described as bioaccumulation. This group, banned from use in many countries, includes industrial chemicals such as PCBs and combustion products like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and furans. In terms of used quantities herbicides are of major importance but their properties differ significantly from chlorohydrocarbons. Herbicides are relatively water soluble but less <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> and less persistent. Thus they don't bioaccumulate and are less toxic having a much lower impact in the environment. Organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethrins and pyrethroids also have, in general, low solubility <b>in</b> <b>fat,</b> relatively high solubility in water but low persistence and are not bioaccumulative. Members of this group can be highly toxic to biota including mammals and aquatic organisms but overall their environmental effects are usually low. Soaps and detergents, containing surfactants, have relatively low toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation. Although discharged to environment in large quantities their effects are generally low. Plastics differ from other contaminants since these substances enter environment as solid wastes with little toxicity but have other adverse environmental effects. The management of these effects relates to their degradation and removal from the system. No Full Tex...|$|R

50|$|Because cannabinoids are <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>fats</b> and alcohols, {{cannabis}} must {{be cooked}} {{with one of}} these two substances in order to infuse the cannabinoids into the food and activate their psychoactive effects.

30|$|Essential oils, {{which are}} known to be mixture of {{volatile}} lipophilic (<b>fat</b> loving, i.e., <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat)</b> and fatty acid present in those extracts, might pass through the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane, disrupting the structural arrangement of different polysaccharides, fatty acids and phospholipids layers and this may affect others cellular structure leading to the death of the bacterial (Carson et al. 2002; Burt 2004; Longbottom et al. 2004). The destruction of the cell wall membrane of bacterial by the essential oil and the fatty acid could make the organism vulnerable to other phytochemicals such as flavonoids, saponins, tannins and alkaloid which been reported as antibacterial agents. According to Aliyu et al. (2012), saponin mode of antibacterial involves membranolytic properties rather than simply altering the surface tension of the extracellular medium. Thus, opening up of the membrane could activate the saponins antibacterial activity.|$|R
50|$|A {{membrane}} lipid is a compound which {{belongs to a}} group of (structurally similar to fats and oils) which form the double-layered surface of all cells (lipid bilayer). The three major classes of {{membrane lipid}}s are phospholipids, glycolipids, and cholesterol. Lipids are amphiphilic: they have one end that is <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> water ('polar') and an ending that is <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> ('nonpolar'). By forming a double layer with the polar ends pointing outwards and the nonpolar ends pointing inwards membrane lipids can form a 'lipid bilayer' which keeps the watery interior of the cell separate from the watery exterior. The arrangements of lipids and various proteins, acting as receptors and channel pores in the membrane, control the entry and exit of other molecules and ions as part of the cell's metabolism. In order to perform physiological functions, membrane proteins are facilitated to rotate and diffuse laterally in two dimensional expanse of lipid bilayer by the presence of a shell of lipids closely attached to protein surface, called annular lipid shell.|$|R
50|$|Some flavor {{elements}} <b>in</b> spices are <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> water; {{many are}} <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> oil or <b>fat.</b> As a general rule, the flavors from a spice {{take time to}} infuse into the food so spices are added early in preparation.

It is a clear, yellowish liquid which boils at 138-139 °C (for the typical 80% purity) and has its flash point at 50 °C, a density of about 1.0 g/mL and a vapor pressure of 1 mmHg at 20 °C. It is non-polar; therefore, diallyl disulfide is insoluble in water and is <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>fats,</b> oils, lipids, and non-polar solvents such as hexane or toluene.|$|E
50|$|Sudan Red G is a {{yellowish}} red lysochrome azo dye. It has {{the appearance}} of an odorless reddish-orange powder with melting point 225 °C.

For the transdermal patch, an initial dose of 4.6 mg per day increases to 9.5 mg per day after four weeks if the patient is not experiencing any intolerable side effects. Patients or caregivers should be reminded to remove the old patch every day, rotate sites and place a new one. It is recommended that the patch be applied to the upper back or torso.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of an experimental uremia in the albino rat by removal of both kidneys {{is followed by}} hypertrophy of the adrenal glands. In the case of male rats 90 days of age this adrenal enlargement amounted to 65 per cent {{and in the case}} of female rats 180 days of age 47 per cent. The increase in the size of the whole gland is due entirely to hypertrophy of the cortex. This increase in the volume of cortical tissue amounted to approximately 40 per cent for males and 61 per cent for females and was due in large part to an increase in the size of the cells. The content of water and material <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> solvents was higher in the uremic than the control glands. However after subtraction of such storage materials a true hypertrophy of the cortex still remained. It amounted to 21 per cent.

Mercury is easily <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>fats,</b> so it penetrates through biological membranes. Both - acute and chronic mercury poisoning causes characteristic clinical symptoms.

40|$|Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH’s) are a {{group of}} fused C 6 -aromatic {{compounds}} present in tar, asphalt, some pesticides and exhaust fumes. They are widespread in the environment (air, water, soil, foods) and are very <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>fats</b> and oils (like cocoa butter). Current cocoa post-harvest practices in some countries supposedly lead {{to high levels of}} PAH contamination in cocoa beans. The EU is currently considering a 2 ppb Benzo(a) pyrene limit on cocoa butter. To improve post-harvest practices in order to reduce PAH contamination, this study was carried out to identify the main sources of PAH contamination of cocoa beans through intentional contamination experiments, involving artificial drying using fire, drying by roadside and storage in diesel contaminated jute sacks. Results indicated that the main cause of PAH in cocoa was through smoke contamination of the beans during drying or storage when the beans came into direct contact with hydrocarbons. This led to heavy contamination, but most of the contamination resided on the shell. Some contamination of the cocoa nibs/cocoa butter however occurred through limited migration of the PAH to the nibs. Broad range recommendations to the cocoa industry are discussed. Briefly, farmer education is needed to warn farmers against the use of fires to dry cocoa beans and storage of cocoa beans together with common hydrocarbon sources such as kerosene, diesel or petrol...|$|E
40|$|Harmful algal blooms {{are natural}} {{phenomena}} {{caused by the}} massive growth of phytoplankton that may contain highly toxic chemicals, the so-called marine biotoxins causing illness and even death to both aquatic organisms and humans. Their occurrence has been increased in frequency and severity, suggesting a worldwide public health risk. Marine biotoxins can accumulate in bivalve molluscs and regulatory limits have been set for some classes according to European Union legislation. These compounds can be distinguished in water- and fat-soluble molecules. The first group involves those of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning and Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning, whereas the toxins <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> can cause Diarrheic Shellfish Poisoning and Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning. Due {{to the lack of}} long-term toxicity studies, establishing tolerable daily intakes for any of these marine biotoxins was not possible, but an acute reference dose can be considered more appropriate, because these molecules show an acute toxicity. Dietary exposure assessment is linked both to the levels of marine biotoxins present in bivalve molluscs and the portion that could be eaten by consumers. Symptoms may vary from a severe gastrointestinal intoxication with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps to neurological disorders such as ataxia, dizziness, partial paralysis, and respiratory distress. The official method for the detection of marine biotoxins is the mouse bioassay (MBA) showing some limits due to ethical restrictions and insufficient specificity. For this reason, the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method has replaced MBA as the reference technique. However, the monitoring of algal blooms producing marine biotoxins should be regularly assessed in order to obtain more reliable, accurate estimates of bloom toxicity and their potential impacts...|$|R
40|$|Since Laug et al. (1) first {{reported}} {{the findings of}} DDT in 30 to 32 human milk samples collected in Washington, D. C. area in 1951, numerous investigators (2 - 25) {{in various parts of}} the United States and other areas of the world have reported finding chlorohydrocarbon pesticide residues in in-dividual and pooled human milk samples. Pesticide body burden in the general popu-lation can be augmented by water, food (26), household dust, air (27), and the na-ture of the home and working environ-ments. Residue levels vary with the type of exposure to which the individual is sub-jected and the individual’s daily intake of residues in food-stuffs. This accounts for the variations in levels observed in different oc-cupations, between rural and urban zones and even between countries. In this respect, it is not surprising to know that in the most remote areas not previously exposed to Western civilization contact, the body bur-den for chiorohydrocarbon pesticide resi-dues was found to be almost nil (28). Stull et al. (29) first noted that there is a rather close correlation between the concen-tration of chlorohydrocarbon pesticide resi-dues <b>in</b> milk <b>fat</b> and that <b>in</b> the adipose tissue of the lactating cow. This finding sim-ply agrees with the fact that all the known chlorohydrocarbon pesticides are readily <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>fat</b> that is rich in the milk and adipose tissue. Therefore, these investiga-tors concluded that the pesticide residue concentration in milk is a good indicator of the body burden of fat-soluble chlorohydro-carbon pesticides. Furthermore, milk is the primary excretory route for these pesticides and their metabolites. The current study reports levels of chlo-rohydrocarbon pesticide residues. Aldrin, a- and y-BHC (lindane), dieldrin, o,p’-DDE, p,p ‘-DDE, o,p ‘-DDT, p,p ‘-DDT, endrin, heptachlor, and heptachlor epoxide were found in human milk entailing analysis of 5 1 subjects.

40|$|PUBLISHED {{information}} on the prop-erties and identity of compounds which impart flavor to poultry is not extensive. Bouthilet (1949, 1950, 1951) observed that the meaty flavor in chicken meat was due to a compound associated with the meat fibers rather than the fat.

Natural products are beginning to dominate the cosmetics market, as are considered to be more environmentally friendly and safe.
