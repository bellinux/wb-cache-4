5000|$|Cost - Private jet {{travel is}} very expensive, and the {{fractional}} {{model can be}} the most costly option (when compared to memberships, charter, etc.). The plans are also complex, with multiple layers of cost that make it nearly impossible to calculate a realistic fully loaded bottom-line per-flight cost. Owners are charged a monthly fee whether or not they fly, and the often-overlooked fuel surcharges can add up to over $1,000 per flight-hour. When owners sell their share back to the provider, the [...] "residual value" [...] calculation can vary substantially, depending on market conditions for used aircraft. Additionally, planes in fractional fleets tend to be flown harder, with more hours and takeoff/landing cycles than the average. This negatively affects residual value. The initial purchase price for a 1/16 share of a light jet starts at over $300,000. Monthly management fees <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>about</b> $9,000 per month.
