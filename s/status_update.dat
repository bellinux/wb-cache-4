25|$|Hashtags (#topic) and user tags (@username) {{make use}} of {{metadata}} in order to track “trending” topics and to alert users of their name’s use within a post on a social media site. Used by various social media websites (most notably Twitter and Facebook), these features add internal linkage between users and themes. Characteristics of a multimodal feature can be seen through the <b>status</b> <b>update</b> option on Facebook. Status updates combine the affordances of personal blogs, Twitter, instant messaging, and texting in a single feature. The 2013 <b>status</b> <b>update</b> button currently prompts a user, “What’s on your mind?” a change from the 2007, “What are you doing right now?” This change was added by Facebook to promote greater flexibility for the user. This multimodal feature allows a user to add text, video, image, links, and tag other users. Twitter's 140 character in a single message microblogging platform allows users the ability to link to other users, websites, and attach pictures. This new media is a platform that is affecting the literacy practice of the current generation by condensing the conversational context of the internet into fewer characters but encapsulating several media.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, {{shortly before}} the release of Evil Dead, a reboot and loose {{continuation}} of the franchise, Raimi confirmed that the next Evil Dead film will be Army of Darkness 2. Campbell confirmed that he would star as an older, but not necessarily wiser, Ash. At a WonderCon panel in March 2013, Campbell and Fede Alvarez, director of the reboot, stated that their ultimate plan was for Alvarez's Evil Dead 2 and Raimi's Army of Darkness 2 {{to be followed by}} a seventh film which would merge the narratives of Ash and Mia. On October 18, 2013, Campbell once again confirmed in an interview with ComicBook.com that he will be reprising his role as Ash in the sequel. Fede Alvarez posted a <b>status</b> <b>update</b> on his Twitter account that Raimi will direct the sequel. Campbell later commented that the rumor about him returning is false.|$|E
25|$|During {{an event}} on March 21, 2016, Apple {{provided}} a <b>status</b> <b>update</b> on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable {{in all of}} its worldwide operations. Lisa P. Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016, 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from post-consumer recycled paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products. Apple working in partnership with Conservation Fund, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in Maine and North Carolina. Another partnership announced is with the World Wildlife Fund to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 MW solar power plant in the Sichuan province of China that was tailor made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In Singapore, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones. Reuses and recycles parts from traded in products.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} an energy harvesting transmitter sending <b>status</b> <b>updates</b> regarding a physical phenomenon it observes to a receiver. Different {{from the existing}} literature, we consider a scenario where the <b>status</b> <b>updates</b> carry information about an independent message. The transmitter encodes this message into the timings of the <b>status</b> <b>updates.</b> The receiver needs to extract this encoded information, as well as <b>update</b> the <b>status</b> of the observed phenomenon. The timings of the <b>status</b> <b>updates,</b> therefore, determine both the age of information (AoI) and the message rate (rate). We study the tradeoff between the achievable message rate and the achievable average AoI. We propose several achievable schemes and compare their rate-AoI performances...|$|R

40|$|When {{creativity}} {{is taken as}} a long-term, complex, and collaborative activity, support for awareness is required for group members to monitor the development of ideas, track how these ideas became narrowed, and understand how alternatives are being implemented and integrated by colleagues. In this paper, we investigate the effects of exposing design rationale to convey awareness, specifically activity awareness, in group creativity. Through evaluating a prototype, we investigate <b>status</b> <b>updates</b> that convey design rationale, and to what consequences, in small groups in fully distributed collaboration. We found that <b>status</b> <b>updates</b> are used {{for a variety of}} purposes and that participants’ comments on their collaborators’ <b>status</b> <b>updates</b> provided feedback. Overall, results suggest that participants’ awareness about their collaborators’ future plans increased over time. Majority of participants found the <b>status</b> <b>updates</b> useful, particularly those with higher metacognitive knowledge.

40|$|The <b>status</b> <b>updates</b> {{posted to}} social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook, contain {{a myriad of}} {{information}} about what people are doing and watching. During events, such as sports games, many updates are sent describing and expressing opinions about the event. In this paper, we describe an algorithm that generates a journalistic summary of an event using only <b>status</b> <b>updates</b> from Twitter as a source. Temporal cues, such as spikes in the volume of <b>status</b> <b>updates,</b> are used to identify the important moments within an event, and a sentence ranking method is used to extract relevant sentences from the corpus of <b>status</b> <b>updates</b> describing each important moment within an event. We evaluate our algorithm compared to human-generated summaries and the previous best summarization algorithm, and find {{that the results of}} our method are superior to the previous algorithm and approach the readability and grammaticality of the human-generated summaries...|$|R

The UK-based focus group primarily draws on English, while the Swiss-based focus group makes use {{of a number of}} different languages and thus displays a more multilingual identity. While in the Swiss focus group <b>status</b> <b>updates</b> are predominantly written in lingua franca English (targeting the wider Facebook group), when engaging in exchanges catering to a smaller group of addressees interlocutors often draw on the language code established offline. Code-switches often function as sources for the enactment of culturally-specific genres, to index a particular addressee and connected with this one’s alignment towards him/her, for formulaic discourse purposes, and to mark that the SU or RSU is humorous (cf. Androutsopoulos 2013). By serving these functions, the display of multilingualism can be linked to identity construction in the highly performative practice of writing <b>status</b> <b>updates</b> and responses to them...|$|R
