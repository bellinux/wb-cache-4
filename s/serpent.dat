5|$|The stoor worm, or Mester Stoor Worm, was a {{gigantic}} evil sea <b>serpent</b> of Orcadian folklore, capable of contaminating plants and destroying {{animals and humans}} with its putrid breath. It is probably an Orkney variant of the Norse Jörmungandr, {{also known as the}} Midgard <b>Serpent,</b> or world <b>serpent,</b> and {{has been described as a}} sea dragon.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya worshipped {{feathered}} <b>serpent</b> deities. Such worship was rare during the Classic period, {{but by the}} Postclassic the feathered <b>serpent</b> had spread to both the Yucatán Peninsula and the Guatemalan Highlands. In Yucatán, the feathered <b>serpent</b> deity was Kukulkan, among the K'iche' it was Q'uq'umatz. Kukulkan had his origins in the Classic period War <b>Serpent,</b> Waxaklahun Ubah Kan, and has also been identified as the Postclassic version of the Vision <b>Serpent</b> of Classic Maya art. Although the cult of Kukulkan had its origins in these earlier Maya traditions, the worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the Quetzalcoatl cult of central Mexico. Likewise, Q'uq'umatz had a composite origin, combining the attributes of Mexican Quetzalcoatl with aspects of the Classic period Itzamna.|$|E

5|$|The Congo <b>serpent</b> eagle is superficially {{similar in}} plumage and size to Cassin's hawk-eagle, {{which has an}} {{overlapping}} range with the <b>serpent</b> eagle. It {{has been suggested that}} the Congo <b>serpent</b> eagle evolved to mimic the Cassin's hawk-eagle, which could give the <b>serpent</b> eagle several advantages, possibly including the ability to trick its reptilian prey into not fleeing, lowering its own predation, and/or minimizing mobbing by birds through its resemblance to a predator of birds. D. s. spectabilis more closely resembles the immature Cassin's hawk-eagle, while D. s. batesi resembles the adult. This is one of very few suspected examples of avian mimicry.|$|E

Thor pulls the <b>serpent</b> on board, and violently slams him in the head with his hammer. Jörmungandr shrieks, and a noisy commotion is heard from underwater before another lacuna appears in {{the manuscript}}.|$|E

5|$|Agitated by this reversal, {{the eldest}} Kaurava, Duryodhana, orders the rakshasa (giant) Alamvusha (or Alambusha), son of Rishyasringa, to kill Iravan. This time Alambusha, {{as well as}} Iravan, uses {{illusion}} in combat. Alambusha attacks Iravan with a bow, but Iravan counters, breaking Alambusha's bow and slicing the giant into several pieces. Alambusha's body, however, reconstitutes itself. Then Iravan assumes {{the form of the}} <b>serpent</b> Shesha (Ananta), and his <b>serpent</b> army surrounds him to protect him. Alambusha counters this by assuming the form of Garuda (the eagle-man), the eternal foe of the serpents, and devours the <b>serpent</b> army. Ultimately, Alambusha kills Iravan by cutting off his head, though Iravan is later avenged when Ghatotkacha, his cousin, finally kills Alambusha.|$|E

Some Romans kept live, harmless snakes as household pets, and credited them with similarly beneficial functions.|$|R

5|$|This <b>serpent</b> eagle {{feeds on}} snakes, chameleons, and toads, and hunts these species by {{dropping}} onto {{them from a}} perch in the understory. Its excellent eyesight enables it to hunt in the dark forest. Very {{little is known about}} its breeding habits, though it is suspected to breed from June to December. The Congo <b>serpent</b> eagle is listed as a species of Least Concern due to its large range and population. This species has been kept as a pet.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about this species' behavior. The Congo <b>serpent</b> eagle lives in the {{understory}} of its habitat and occasionally perches on lower boughs in tall trees. It lives either alone or in pairs. This species is known to hunt snakes, lizards, especially chameleons, toads, and potentially small mammals. It hunts by dropping to the ground from its perch in the understory, where it may strike its prey repeatedly with its feet; this <b>serpent</b> eagle may also grab prey from the foliage while hunting. Its large eyes enable this species to hunt in low light, though it is diurnal. Studies on the species' eyes have shown that they have about two times the visual resolution of a human's. It may breed from October to December in Gabon and from June to November in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E
