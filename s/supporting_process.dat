While process enactment enables a project manager to plan and monitor a process and guides the participating developers, process modeling aims at understanding, communicating and reusing process descriptions. Thus, requirements for languages <b>supporting</b> <b>process</b> enactment are quite different from those for languages <b>supporting</b> <b>process</b> modeling. In this paper we demonstrate how the task of process modeling can be tackled using a standard object-oriented modeling notation, the Unified Modeling Language.
