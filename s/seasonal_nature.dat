5|$|The {{availability}} of food reflects the <b>seasonal</b> <b>nature</b> {{of the forests}} in which they live. During the hot season, fruit, flowers, and young leaves are more abundant, whereas the cold, wet season offers more young leaves and flowers. Despite this, the diet changes little between seasons, except that females will consume more high-protein, low-fiber items, such as young leaves and flowers, during pregnancy and lactation in order to offset the energy costs of reproduction. Nectar is only available sporadically, yet constitutes a major food source when the flowers bloom. The nectar of the traveller's palm (Ravenala madagascariensis) is a favorite among ruffed lemurs.|$|E
5|$|There were problems. Inflated bomb damage {{assessment}} reports during operations in northeastern Laos were common, but {{the cause was}} not difficult to discern. Mountainous terrain, poor weather, ground cover, the lack of ground forces for confirmation, and the language barrier all contributed to overestimation of the damage inflicted on communist forces by the bombing effort. The result was a skewed sense of the effectiveness and {{the capabilities of the}} campaign. The results of the campaign (which were made obvious by the repeating <b>seasonal</b> <b>nature</b> of PAVN and Pathet Lao offensives), however, indicated that American airpower was quite effective.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} {{irrigation}} {{water in the}} Sacramento area {{and other parts of}} the Central Valley were also growing. In 1854, a diversion dam was constructed on the North Fork American River at the site of Auburn Dam, to divert water into ditches that supplied downstream farms. Irrigation with dam and canal systems was favored because the <b>seasonal</b> <b>nature</b> of the American River caused floods in some years and droughts in others. A large dam at the Auburn site was thus considered for both flood control and water supply. In the 1950s, the Bureau of Reclamation created the first plans for a high dam at Auburn. Several designs, ranging from earth-fill to concrete gravity dams, were considered. Before the dam could be built, the Auburn-Foresthill Road – which crosses the river just upstream of the dam site – had to be relocated. Even before the project was authorized, contracts were let for the construction of a high bridge to carry the road over the proposed reservoir, as well as preliminary excavations at the dam site.|$|E

25|$|The mid-1980s brought {{difficult}} times for Plaxton. A decline in orders {{due to the}} economic climate was compounded by management and production problems.

25|$|Wastewater {{generated}} from agricultural and food operations has distinctive characteristics that set it {{apart from common}} municipal wastewater managed by public or private sewage treatment plants throughout the world: it is biodegradable and non-toxic, but has high concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS). The constituents of food and agriculture wastewater are often complex to predict, due to the differences in BOD and pH in effluents from vegetable, fruit, and meat products and due to the <b>seasonal</b> <b>nature</b> of food processing and post-harvesting.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} Leslie matrix {{model for the}} {{population}} dynamics of S. lagocephalus in La Reunion. In order to capture both the amphidromous and the <b>seasonal</b> <b>natures</b> of the species' life history the model has four stages (sea + three river sites) and is periodic. Baseline parameters (age-specific fecundity, spatial dispersion patterns and survival rates) were chosen {{in such a way}} that the dominant eigenvalue of the year-on-year projection matrix is 1. Large uncertainties on the parameter values preclude the use of the model for management purpose. A sensitivity/uncertainty analysis sheds light on the parameters that cause much of the output to vary and that are poorly known: the life expectancy in rivers and the mortality both at river mouths and during the drift of larvae to sea. This work should help researchers understand which factors and parameters need to be better known and estimated before the model can be developed as an accurate management tool...|$|R
