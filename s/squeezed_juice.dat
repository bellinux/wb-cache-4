5000|$|After {{three years}} of hiatus, on January 29, 2010, the band {{launched}} an official Facebook page. Later they announced new members: Bassist Thor Georg Buer (Grave Declaration), guitarist Robert Bordevik (Grievance, Vardøger), drummer Jo Henning Børven (Grave Declaration, Morgenroede) and keyboardist Nickolas Main Henriksen (Aspera, Desdemon). With this line-up, the band played a stage show at Nordic Fest 2010 in Oslo. On November 4, 2010 they announced signing to Bombworks Records to record a new album and an EP. After some line-up changes in mid-2011, Erik Normann Aanonsen (Moddi) joined on bass while Thor Georg switched to guitar, and the show at the Norwegian Seaside Festival was with that line-up. The album has been recorded and will be mixed and mastered in Sweden. Guitarist Thor also left the band to focus on his college education, but stated he may return if the opportunity arises. The fourth album, Omen, was released on November 30, 2012. A Brazilian tour was announced for early 2013. During the Belo Horizonte leg of this tour, the band faced a protest organized by Black Metal/Anti-Christianity radicals who rejected {{the possibility of a}} Christian black metal band to perform in the city. Since the radicals were already announcing their intentions via Internet, the local police had assigned one private policeman in addition to the 30 security guards present to help guaranteeing the security of the show. At one point, the officer had to fire some shots towards the sky to control the rioters. A video posted on YouTube shows a group of radicals screaming [...] "Fuck You Antestor!" [...] outside the venue and the local police escorting the band members.After the show, the band posted a public statement about the incident, thanking their fans for coming despite of the risks involved, and blessing the radicals: [...] "We are proud to call you our brothers and sisters in Christ.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the microbiological safety of Kinnow-mandarins (Citrus nobilis X Citrus deliciosa) used for preparation of fresh <b>squeezed</b> <b>juices</b> by street vendors. One hundred and fifty Kinnow mandarin samples were collected from different points in the distribution chain from the same lot, washed and aliquots of the wash samples were analyzed for total aerobes, Staphylococcus, total and fecal coliforms, Salmonella and Shigella. Although, there was no notable increase in the total aerobic, total or fecal coliform counts, total staphylococcal counts increased significantly (P< 0. 05) during distribution to street vendors; seventy-two samples from the street vendors showed the presence of coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, twenty-three of these produced enterotoxins B and C. Salmonella and Shigella were not detected in any of the samples. Sources of high numbers of enterotoxigenic S. aureus were traced to unhygienic manual handling by middle level buyers and by street vendors. The results of our study demonstrate the poor microbiological quality of Kinnow-mandarins, the possible entry points of contaminants in the distribution chain of these fruits and unhygienic vending practices.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the search}} for {{healthier}} dietary food choices has increased the demand for fresh and nutritive products. Several epidemiological studies indicate that fruits, vegetables and less processed food ensure a higher protection against diseases caused by oxidative stress. Citrus juices attract attention {{as a result of}} their health-related properties, due to the presence of natural antioxidants. Orange juice, in particular, is one of the most consumed juices worldwide and it is an important source of flavonoids and phenolic compounds. As a result of the development of new technologies and the improvement of traditional industrial processing, there is a wide range of new commercial juices promoted by strong marketing strategies. In fact, it is important to evaluate whether these processed products maintain similar properties to a freshly <b>squeezed</b> <b>juice.</b> The main objective of the present work was to evaluate the antioxidant activity of six samples of orange juice: one nectar, three concentrated juices, and two freshly squeezed juices (filtrated and non-filtrated). The oranges and orange juices were acquired in local supermarkets, and the antioxidant activity was determined comparing three different methods: 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH●), Folin-Ciocalteu method (applied to determine total phenolics, using gallic acid as standard) and total flavonoids assay (using epicatechin as standard). All the analyses were performed at least in duplicate. For DDPH● assay, the EC 50 value (inversely proportional to antioxidant activity) was higher for the nectar (13. 8 ± 0. 33 mg/mL), followed by freshly squeezed juices (12. 6 ± 0. 59 and 12. 3 ± 0. 22 mg/mL, filtrated and non-filtrated, respectively) and concentrated juice (9. 01 ± 0. 03 mg/mL). The highest value for total phenolics was found in concentrated juices (0. 208 ± 0. 04 mg/mL), whereas the lowest corresponds to the orange nectar (0. 134 ± 0. 00 mg/mL). With respect to total flavonoids content, the values varied between 0. 099 ± 0. 00 and 0. 158 ± 0. 01 mg/mL, for nectar and concentrated juices, respectively. Our results indicated that orange juice can be considered a good source of natural antioxidants, including flavonoids and phenolic compounds. The methods for antioxidant activity evaluation showed that orange nectar had the lowest antioxidant capacity, whereas the concentrated juices presented the highest. There is no evidence that filtration of the freshly <b>squeezed</b> <b>juice</b> produced considerable variations. Although the industrial processing of orange juice may cause losses of vitamin C, it is a common practice of food industry to add L-ascorbic acid at the end of the processing. In fact, commercial concentrated juices revealed higher values of antioxidant activity, flavonoids and phenolic compounds, than the freshly squeezed juices.

40|$|Introduction: Citrus juices are {{important}} sources of health-promoting compounds. Orange juice, in particular, {{is rich in}} natural antioxidants, such as vitamin C. Human plasma levels of L-ascorbic acid are entirely dependent on dietary sources, such as fruits and vegetables, since {{we are unable to}} synthesize this vitamin. Moreover, evidence shows that in a great percentage of the population, plasma levels of this vitamin are suboptimal for the beneficial health effects of vitamin C. This important compound acts as an antioxidant, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, arteriosclerosis and some forms of cancer. Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for vitamin C was established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences. Values given for healthy males and females, > 19 years, are 90 mg/day and 75 mg/day, respectively. Objectives: To determine total vitamin C content, L-ascorbic acid and L-dehydroascorbic acid in six samples of orange juice (one nectar, three concentrated juices, one filtrated freshly <b>squeezed</b> <b>juice</b> and one non-filtrated freshly <b>squeezed</b> <b>juice)</b> and to evaluate the nutritional value of these juices as a source of vitamin C. Materials and methods: The oranges and orange juices were acquired in local supermarkets, and only the edible portion was analyzed. Vitamin C content was determined by a highly precise and accurate High Performance Liquid Chromatography method coupled with a photodiode array detector, previously validated. The total vitamin C content was determined by reducing dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbic acid (adding a reducing agent tris(2 -carboxyethyl) phosphine). Results and discussion: Total vitamin C content in the analysed samples varied between 42. 5 ± 0. 7 and 66. 4 ± 0. 2 mg/ 100 g of edible portion, for nectar and concentrated juice, respectively. The highest ascorbic acid value and the lowest dehydroascorbic acid content (60. 9 ± 0. 3 and 1. 3 ± 0. 6 mg/ 100 g of edible portion, respectively) were observed in the concentrated juice. The freshly squeezed juices presented higher vitamin C and ascorbic acid contents than the nectar. Considering an intake of 100 mL of juice, the commercial juices can supply 57 % to 88 % of DRI for females and 36 % to 61 % of DRI for males. With respect to freshly squeezed orange juice, 100 mL can contribute with 66 % and 51 % of DRI, for females and males, respectively. Conclusions: Taking into account the established DRI, orange juices can be considered a good source of vitamin C. Most of the vitamin C content in the analysed orange juices is due to the presence of L-ascorbic acid, which is the main biologically active form of this vitamin and it is an effective antioxidant. Since orange juice is an important and highly consumed source of vitamin C, and due to the wide range of different types of orange juices available in the market, it is essential to analyse total vitamin C content (L-ascorbic and L-dehydroascorbic).
