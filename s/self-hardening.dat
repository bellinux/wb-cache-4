In recent studies, CPC-chitosan composites are developed with {{high mechanical strength}} and washout resistance. The objectives {{of the present study}} are to optimize the setting time and mechanical properties of a CPC-chitosan composite by tailoring the chitosan content, and to evaluate the bioresorbability by using an dissolution model. Six chitosan mass fractions are tested: 0, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 %. Specimens are immersed in solutions with pH ranging from 3. 5 to 5 to simulate the acidic environments produced by osteoclasts in. Dissolution is measured as the fraction of mass loss versus immersion time from 7 d to 28 d. The CPC-chitosan composite with 20 % by mass chitosan has a setting time (mean±SD; n= 4) of 13 1 min, significantly less than 87 7 min for CPC control without chitosan (p 0. 1). The dissolution rates (fraction of mass loss per day,%/d) were 1. 05 for CPC control and 1. 08 for CPC-chitosan. In summary, a CPC-chitosan composite is developed with fast-setting and a flexural strength three-fold of that of CPC control without chitosan. Both materials are soluble in acidic environments, indicating that adding chitosan did not compromise the bioresorbability of CPC. The strong and resorbable CPC–chitosan composite may be useful in moderate stress-bearing craniofacial and orthopedic repairs...|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cements are hydraulic cements. These {{are formed}} {{by a combination}} of one or more calcium orthophosphate powders. Calcium orthophosphates have been studied as bone re-pair materials for the last 80 years. CPC <b>self-hardens</b> to form hydroxyapatite, having excellent osteoconductivity and bone-replacement capability. The present study was aimed at preparation of alpha tricalcium phosphate and Si doped alpha tricalcium phosphate and studying the effect of addition of glass fibers into them. The physicochemical and mechanical properties of á-tricalcium phosphate (á-TCP) cement and Si doped á-TCP were studied. á-TCP was prepared by solid state sintering of CaCO 3, CaHPO 4 and Si doped á-TCP powders were synthesized by reacting mixtures of CaCO 3, CaHPO 4, and SiO 2 (TEOS). Setting time, phase composition, hydrolysis conversion rate, microstructure, and diametral tensile strength (DTS) of undoped CPC and Si-doped CPC were studied and compared. Both initial and final setting time of the developed cement was delayed because of Si addition. Crystalline phases of HA (JCPDS 9 - 432), á-TCP (JCPDS 29 - 359) and â-TCP (JCPDS 9 - 169) were detected in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern after setting and immersion in SBF for 0 hours to 10 days. The intensities of the á-TCP peaks at 22. 2 ° (201) and 24. 1 ° (161,- 331) decreased when the time of immersion in SBF increased from 0 hours to 10 days, due to its transformation into HA. Si doped CPC showed little slower rate of conversion into HA phase as compared to undoped CPC. The SEM image of the microstructure of cement showed better compactness and greater crystal entanglement in undoped CPC as compared to Si-doped CPC. This lower porosity and greater compactness in the microstructure attributes to greater DTS values observed in undoped CPC. Addition of 10 wt % of e-glass fiber into Si-doped á-TCP increased the mechanical strength of CPC as the fibers could make the structure compact and provide reinforcement...|$|R

40|$|A {{single crystal}} {{plasticity}} theory for insertion into finite element simulation is formulated using sequential laminates to model subgrain dislocation structures. It {{is known that}} local models do not adequately account for latent hardening, as latent hardening {{is not only a}} material property, but a nonlocal property (e. g. grain size and shape). The addition of the nonlocal energy from the formation of subgrain structure dislocation walls and the boundary layer misfits provide both latent and <b>self-hardening</b> of a crystal slip. Latent hardening occurs as the formation of new dislocation walls limits motion of new mobile dislocations, thus hardening future slip systems. <b>Self-hardening</b> is accomplished by an evolution of the subgrain structure length scale. The substructure length scale is computed by minimizing the nonlocal energy. The minimization of the nonlocal energy is a competition between the dislocation wall energy and the boundary layer energies. The nonlocal terms are also directly minimized within the subgrain model as they affect deformation response. The geometrical relationship between the dislocation walls and slip planes affecting the dislocation mean free path is taken into account, giving a first-order approximation to shape effects. A coplanar slip model is developed due to requirements while modeling the subgrain structure. This subgrain structure plasticity model is noteworthy as all material parameters are experimentally determined rather than fit.

The waste samples ranged from coarse materials, such as bottom ashes and spent bed materials, to fine {{materials such as}} fly ashes and cyclone ashes. Based {{on the results of}} the waste characterizations, an analysis of appropriate waste management practices for the advanced process wastes was done. The analysis indicated that using conventional waste management technology should be possible for disposal of all the advanced process wastes studied for task three. However, some wastes did possess properties that could present special problems for conventional waste management systems. Several task three wastes were <b>self-hardening</b> materials and one was self-heating. <b>Self-hardening</b> is caused by cementitious and pozzolanic reactions that occur when water is added to the waste. All of the <b>self-hardening</b> wastes setup slowly (in a matter of hours or days rather than minutes). Thus these wastes can still be handled with conventional management systems if care is taken not to allow them to setup in storage bins or transport vehicles. Waste self-heating is caused by the exothermic hydration of lime when the waste is mixed with conditioning water. If enough lime is present, the temperature of the waste will rise until steam is produced. It is recommended that self-heating wastes be conditioned in a controlled manner so that the heat will be safely dissipated before the material is transported to an ultimate disposal site. Waste utilization is important because an advanced process waste will not require ultimate disposal when it is put to use. Each task three waste was evaluated for utilization potential based on its physical properties, bulk chemical composition, and mineral composition. Only one of the thirteen materials studied might be suitable for use as a pozzolanic concrete additive.

40|$|Burnishing is a {{mechanical}} finishing operation performed on workpieces {{to enhance their}} surface quality through plastic deformation. One of the main issues to understand the overall process is {{the behavior of the}} elastoplastic deformations caused by the burnishing ball on the workpiece. The first burnishing passes performed on the workpiece surface lead to its plastic strain and <b>self-hardening,</b> thus influencing the results of consecutive passes. Some references have studied the phenomenon of indentation, finding that there is a certain <b>self-hardening</b> coefficient threshold which allows to predict the presence of pile-ups {{at the edges of the}} indentation path. Nevertheless, burnishing is not a single-pass operation. On the contrary, burnishing a whole surface requires successive adjacent and/or overlapping passes, i. e., parallel passes separated consecutively a certain lateral pass width. No reference has been found in the literature defining the adequate values of the lateral pass width with regards to the pile-up effect to enhance the final topology of the burnished surface. This paper explores that influence by studying the presence of the pile-up effect after burnishing a single or several overlapping passes on two materials (aluminum and steel), by characterizing the topology of the generated path. Afterwards, two adjacent passes are performed, varying the lateral pass width, to compare the final surface roughness derived from each operation. An optimum value for the lateral pass width was found, to improve the final roughness after burnishing in different conditions and to increase the productivity of the process.

We have devised a method of measuring desquamation wherein the desquamating cells are determined as the total alkali-soluble protein after they are removed from the skin surface with an inert, <b>self-hardening</b> gel. Highly reproducible desquamation rates are obtained, characteristic of the individual subject. Using some common exfoliants, we show that pharmacologic response, observed as an increase in desquamation rate, is also an individual characteristic...|$|E
40|$|Grain {{refinement}} {{offers several}} benefits in aluminum casting applications. It {{can be performed}} by inoculation, representing one of the mostly used method at industrial level {{and is based on}} the addition of nucleating agents. By using grain refinement method important benefits can be reached, for both cast and wrought aluminum alloys: a fine distribution of the secondphases, improved castability, reduction of shrinkage porosity, higher mechanical properties, as well superior fatigue life. In the present paper investigation of the effect of Al- 5 Ti- 1 B grain refiner on the microstructure and on the mechanical properties of <b>self-hardening</b> aluminum alloy will be presented and discussed. The appropriate use of grain refiner contributes to improve the mechanical properties, particularly the strength and the ductility of the alloy...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} well-bonded pipe {{coupling}} space filling control {{by means of}} ultrasonic NDT methods has been proposed. Use of ultrasonic NDT method for coupling space filling with <b>self-hardening</b> substance (both compound and molten metal coupling space filling) has been analyzed. Taking into consideration the high temperature of the repair structure during repair works performance when using a molten metal, which is determined by high temperature, the application of piezo-electric transducers is ineffective. Therefore, it is offered to use electromagnetic (EMA) transducer as the emitter and receiver of ultrasonic oscillations. Theoretical and experimental research results of weld bonded coupling space filling with molten metal control have confirmed the efficiency of EMA method use. The proposed control method allows to reach the maximum efficiency {{in the use of}} coupling space filling with molten metal. ????????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ????? ? ??????? ?????????????? ??????? ?????????????? ????????. ???????? ?????? ????????????? ??????????????? ?????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ????????? ??? ? ??????????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????????, ??? ? ? ??????????? ????????????? ????????. ? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ??????????? ?? ????? ?????????? ????? ??? ????????????? ?????????????? ???????, ???????????? ???????????? ??? ?????????, ?????????? ???????? ???????????????? ?????????????????? ???????????????? ??????????????. ??????? ? ???????? ?????????? ? ????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ???? ?????? ???????????? ????????? ????????????????

40|$|The metric {{characters}} {{of the head and}} hard palate of 138 black males from Kenya and 110 male !Kung San from Namibia have for the first time been compared to describe the black and Khoisan variation with respect to these special trait systems. The palate measurements were taken from prints of <b>self-hardening</b> plastic. Nearly all metric characters show {{significant differences between the two}} populations, which are reflected in a relevant discriminant function. The analyses of correlations between the individual head and palate measurements yield different correlation patterns in the two samples also with regard to their significance and direction. These results and the generally low correlation coefficients can be explained by the complex processes of allometric head growth, resulting in the Sans’ pedomorphous and the blacks’ more adultiform head and palate trait combinations...|$|E
