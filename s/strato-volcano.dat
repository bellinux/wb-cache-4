40|$|Boron and {{beryllium}} {{concentrations were}} measured in a diverse suite of well-characterized rocks from the Mexican Volcanic Belt (MVB). Low B and high Be result in relatively low B/Be ratios in the MVB, {{compared to other}} arcs. Nevertheless, B systematics resemble those of other arcs and provide insights into mantle processes. In the MVB, B enrichment depends first on magma type, and second on edifice type and location. B/Be values are highest (5 – 15) in andesites and dacites erupted from calcalkaline <b>strato-volcanoes</b> located along the volcanic front, such as Volcan Colima and V. San Juan. Rocks from <b>strato-volcanoes</b> located behind the volcanic front generally have lower values (1 – 5). B/Be values are also elevated in differentiated members of rock suites that show evidence for significant crustal assimilation. In the westernmost MVB, west of the Michoacán-Guanajuato Volcanic Field (MGVF), cindercone ejecta, including basalts, lamprophyres, and basanites, contain low B/Be values (3 ̆c 5). The lamprophyres and basanites have very low B/Be, despite high Ba/Ce and other common measures of subduction signature. In the MGVF, where cinder cones occur exclusively, B/Be values in primitive calc-alkaline basalts are distinctly higher than those from alkaline basalts (3 – 8 vs. 1 – 3), indicating that high B/Be is a mantle-derived feature and not an artifact of crustal assimilation. Comparison among various elemental ratios indicates that Cs and U show enrichment patterns similar to B; all are enriched in calc-alkaline rocks, but not in lamprophyres or basanites. In contrast, Ba, K, and Sr, are enriched in both calc-alkaline rocks and the lamprophyres and basanites. Multi-stage processes and differing melting mechanisms are inferred to explain the variable characteristics of MVB volcanic rocks. First, slab-derived fluids, rich in fluid-mobile elements including B and Ba, infiltrate the mantle wedge. These fluids cause fluid-fluxed melting that produces calc-alkaline magmas enriched in all fluid-mobile elements. These lavas erupt from large, volcanic-front <b>strato-volcanoes.</b> The slab-derived fluids also metasomatize portions of the mantle wedge, producing phlogopite and/or amphibole. These phases have high partition coefficients for Ba-Sr-K, but may have low partition coefficients for B-Cs-U. Accordingly, subduction-zone metasomatism produces a mantle wedge enriched in Ba-Sr-K, but not necessarily in B-Cs-U. Decompression melting {{of this type of}} metasomatized mantle will consume the hydrous phases and produce magmas such as lamprophyres or basanites with high Ba/Ce, Sr/La, and K/La, but low B/Be, Cs/La, and U/La. This interpretation implies two types of subduction-zone signatures: one involving enriched Ba-Sr-K, elements that have longer residence times in the mantle wedge, and another involving enriched B-Cs-U, which all partition so strongly into fluids or melts that they have short residence times in the mantle, and are only enriched in magmas generated by fluid-fluxed melting or that have assimilated crustal material. Assimilation of granites and crustal rocks can also enrich differentiated lavas in B...|$|R

30|$|The {{persistent}} eruptive {{activity and}} edifice morphology makes of “strombolian” volcanoes the ideal laboratory to exploit muon radiography techniques. The Stromboli volcano of the Aeolian Islands in southern Italy {{is considered one}} of the most active volcanoes in the world. Its persistent but moderate explosive activity is only interrupted by rare episodes of more vigorous activity accompanied by lava flows. This volcano is particularly suited for the application of muon radiography technique, since it is an open conduit volcano characterized by persistent conduit degassing and explosive dynamics. A detailed image of the volcanic edifice can help to map the conduit network path and monitor the eruption processes by surveying the magma emplacement at shallow depths close to the vents (Acocella et al., 2006; Chouet et al., 2008). Stromboli is a composite <b>strato-volcano</b> that steeply reaches ∼ 900 m above sea level, thus allowing to image a large portion of the volcano edifice by muon radiography.|$|E
40|$|We {{show the}} results of {{simulations}} of basaltic <b>strato-volcano</b> activity by using a cellular automaton model where magma is allowed to rise through self-organized crack networks.

Magma degassing is also taken into account by means {{of the relationship between the}} pressure-controlled water solubility and the lithostatic pressure. We study the statistical properties of the automaton by varying the model parameters and, in particular, the thickness of the uppermost rock layer, which controls the buoyancy rate of magma rise because of its low value of density.

We propose that early cotectic crystallization of amphibole and Caplagioclase may reflect H 2 O-rich melts. Variations in major and trace elements among lavas erupted from coeval centres, suggest that fractional crystallization was the principal evolutionary process {{but at the same time}} magmas feeding the various volcanoes belonging to the Rocche Unit were more heterogeneous with respect to the younger Units studied here...|$|E
50|$|In Ecuador, the Andes {{are divided}} into two {{parallel}} Cordilleras - ranges of lofty mountains hyphenated only by occasional passes and massive, glacier-domed <b>strato-volcanoes.</b> Between these two great ranges lies the Central Valley, whose rich soils and temperate climes support much of the country’s modern population.

Pre-Columbian civilizations have long toiled the rich volcanic soils found here for crops such as corn, legumes, potatoes and other indigenous tubers as well as to produce textiles derived from the wool of alpacas and llamas, native camelids domesticated by these peoples. Just prior to European contact, Guandera lay in the northernmost reaches of the Incan Empire and to this day is perched above one of Ecuador’s richest agricultural zones. The valley below is intensively cultivated by mestizo farmers - descendents of the Incas whose blood is mixed with that of their European conquerors. As populations and the demand for industrialized crops continue to expand, the cultivated zone of the valley continues to encroach on the remnant forest surrounding the privately protected Guandera Biological Station.|$|R
40|$|In Early Miocene {{times the}} Cordillera {{did not exist}} and the Pacific Ocean reached the Oriente. In the Middle Miocene, the uplift of an {{elongated}} swell, consisting of Palaeozoic and older rocks, created the Eastern Cordillera. Decollements were activated diverging away from the Eastern Cordillera. In the eastern trench, located approximately in correspondence with the present day Interandean Depression, many thousands of meters of sediments were deposited.

Uplift brought the planation surface to 3500 – 4000 m. The Interandean Depression, bounded by normal faults, was created during the Upper Pliocene, and large <b>strato-volcanoes</b> erupted at this time. The volcanic activity contributed to the filling of an accumulation plateau preserved today {{in many parts of the}} Interandean Depression.

40|$|Several {{investigators}} have tackled {{the problem of}} the main causes that produce the slopes of volcanic cones, especially with a view to explaining the characteristic concave profiles of <b>strato-volcanoes</b> *). A satisfactory result has not been arrived at, however. This became evident to the present author while studying the submarine slopes of volcanoes in the East Indies. A number of submarine sections of isolated volcanic piles were constructed from the echo-soundings of the Snellius Expedition and from the data contained in the fair sheets of the Hydrographical Survey. These sections combined with the corresponding subaerial profiles will be reproduced in the Scientific Results of “the Snellius Expedition, Volume V: Geology, Part 1 : Geological Interpretation of the Bathymetrical Results”, together with a discussion of their shapes and the mode of their formation. An explanation of the wet part of the slope is not possible, however, until we understand the agents influencing the dry part. But as we said, this subject has not been adequately treated. An attempt had therefore first to be made to analyse the factors that play a part in the production of subaerial slopes of volcanoes. In order to test the validity of the deductions an experimental investigation was undertaken that will be described below. These experiments were carried out in the laboratory for experimental geology in the Leyden geological institute...|$|R
40|$|We {{simulated}} {{the pattern}} of activity of a <b>strato-volcano</b> by using a cellular automaton model where magma is allowed to ascend to the surface through self-organized crack networks. Magma rises toward the surface by filling connected paths of fractures until the magma's density is {{less than that of}} surrounding rocks. If magma enters a region with negative or neutral buoyancy, it cools and solidifies; as a result, the local density profile is modified, and magmatic dikes are formed. We simulated the temporal evolution of high-density pathways of dikes that magma may eventually utilize to reach the surface. We showed that if a shallow neutral–negative buoyancy zone is restored after eruptions, due to, for example, piecemeal or chaotic collapses, a characteristic timescale appears in the inter-event repose time distribution. Such characteristic repose time represents the average time that magma takes to form a high-density pathway through the less dense rock layer, and it may give a hint to predict possible eruptive scenarios. Even if the model includes many simplifying assumptions in the definition of magma–rock interaction, the results obtained from simulations are consistent with the eruptive behavior of the Mt. Somma-Vesuvius volcano for the 1631 – 1944 period...|$|E

40|$|Flank eruptions of Mt. Etna mostly {{result from}} {{drainage}} of plagioclase-rich magma {{from the central}} volcano conduits, but rarer ones emitting plagioclase-free aphyric magma, are driven by dyke propagation from beneath the volcano, bypassing the central conduits. An archetype of such events is the January-March 1974 eruption that developed in two explosive phases. New data for the mineralogy and geochemistry of the 1974 products and the coeval earthquake distribution, indicate that the eruption was likely triggered by deep tectonic fracturing that allowed a dyke to propagate from ~ 11 km depth below the summit at a minimal rate of 10 - 2 m s- 1. We point to initially fast, closed system ascent of the volatile-rich magma, leading to lava fountains during the very first stage of the two eruption phases, followed by slower magma rise and increasing gas-melt separation (strombolian explosions) within the upper portion of the feeder dyke. The anomalous K-rich composition but also distinct Rb/Th, Cl/K and S/Cl ratios of the 1974 trachybasalts, tracked a recent mixing of 25 % pre-existing low K-trachybasalts with a 75 % new alkali-rich magma whose almost pure extrusion occurred in 2001 - 2003. This new input was first revealed by the 1974 event. We propose an updated terminology - sub-volcano dyke (SVD) eruptions - for 1974 -type flank eruptions on Etna and other basaltic <b>strato-volcanoes,</b> which focuses on their driving mechanism and thereby allows us to distinguish them from the more common central conduit dyke (CCD) flank eruptions.

40|$|Antisana volcano is {{representative}} of many active andesitic <b>strato-volcanoes</b> of Pleistocene age in Ecuador's Eastern Cordillera. This study represents the first modern geological and volcanological investigation of Antisana since the late 1890 's; it also summarizes the present geochemical understanding of its genesis. The volcano's development includes the formation and destruction of two older edifices (Antisana I and II) during some 400 + ka. Antisana II suffered a sector collapse about 15, 000 years ago which {{was followed by the}} birth and growth of Antisana III. During its short life Antisana III has generated >= 50 eruptions of small to medium intensity, often associated with andesitic to dacitic lava flows and tephra, as well as with late Pleistocene and Holocene glacial advances. Throughout its long history Antisana's lavas have been characterized by a persistent mineral assemblage, consisting of 30 40 vol% phenocrysts of plagioclase, both clino- and orthopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxides, with rare occurrences of olivine or amphibole, frequently in a microcrystalline to glassy matrix. This uniformity occurs despite the magma's progressive chemical evolution over >= 400 ka from early basic andesites (53 - 58 wt % SiO 2) to intermediate and Si-rich andesites (58 - 62 % SiO 2), and recently to dacites (63 - 67 % SiO 2). Chemical diagrams suggest that crystal fractionation was the most likely magmatic process of evolution. The exception to this slowly evolving history was the short-lived emission at 210 ka of the Cuyuja lavas from Antisana II that generated a 73 km long andesitic lava flow. Contrasting with Antisana's general magmatic trend, Cuyuja lava (similar to 11 km(3)) is a high-Mg andesite with unusually high concentrations of incompatible elements. Antisana developed within the Chacana caldera complex, a large active siliceous center that began similar to 3 Ma ago, however its lavas are chemically distinct from coeval lavas of Chacana...|$|R
40|$|The Azores archipelago, located {{close to}} the triple {{junction}} where the Eurasian, African and American plates meet, {{is an example of}} plume related magmatism. Mantle plumes have been the locus of an intense debate. Their ultimate origin has been assigned to the D” layer, to the bottom of transition zone and even to the astenosphere, as the result of passive response to lithosphere cracking (e. g. Courtillot et al., 2003). He isotope geochemistry is a key tool to clear up this question given its ability to identify the incorporation of relatively undegassed lower mantle portions in plumes (with 4 He/ 3 He ratios as low as 20. 000 or R/Ra= 32) and to distinguish them from those generated in a degassed upper mantle generally accepted as the MORB source (with constant 4 He/ 3 He ratios around 90. 000 or R/Ra 8; e. g. Allègre et al., 1995). More recently, it has been demonstrated that the two mantle reservoirs expected from helium isotope systematics can be substantiated by neon data (Moreira et Allègre, 1998). In this work we present the first Ne isotopic data collected from Terceira samples; these data, in addition to new He isotope determinations, are used to better constrain the origin of the Azores mantle plume. The noble gases analyses were performed at IPG in Paris by crushing of olivine phenocrysts (~ 1 g). This method is particularly useful for measuring the mantle gases released by melt inclusions trapped inside the olivine crystals. Terceira island comprises four main <b>strato-volcanoes</b> (Self, 1976) : Cinco Picos, Guilherme Moniz, Pico Alto and Santa Bárbara. At least the later two are considered to be active and connected by a fissure zone regarded by some authors as the Terceira rift (e. g. Udías, 1980). One of the oldest features of the island is expressed by the Cinco Picos caldera (7 km in diameter) that should be younger than 300. 000 years (K/Ar data from Feraud et al., 1980). Previous studies have shown that Terceira lavas combine relatively high radiogenic lead isotopic signatures typical from HIMU basalts (206 Pb/ 204 Pb up to 20. 02) and slight primitive He signatures, with 63780 as a minimum value of 4 He/ 3 He ratio (R/Ra= 11. 3; Dupré et al., 1982; Moreira et al., 1999). A lower value of 48821 (R/Ra= 14. 8) was now obtained, strengthening the contribution of lower mantle to Terceira magmas. Our results also suggest a stratigraphic control on the variation of He isotopic signatures since the most primitive values appear to be confined to the most ancient rocks. In fact, values lower than 68814 (R/Ra ratios higher than 10, 5) were found in one lava collected near the village of Säo Sebastiäo (SE of Terceira, {{in one of the most}} eroded landscape of the island) and in samples from the lower levels of a 20 m thick lava flow sequence exposed in the actual sea cliff near the village of Santa Bárbara (SW of Terceira). At least for the later samples, we exclude the possibility of a cosmogenic 3 He contribution since this sequence is exposed in a relatively recent erosion surface. Our results raise important questions concerning the evolution of the Açores plume; several interpretations seems to be plausible, as the changing with time of the source isotopic signature or the increase of mixing with a MORB. These hypothesis will be better constrained in future works. Some of the analysed samples show higher 20 Ne/ 22 Ne and 21 Ne/ 22 Ne ratios than air suggesting the presence of a mantle component in the olivine melt inclusions. Moreover, in a three-Ne isotope diagram, the samples define a trend with a higher slope than the MORB line (e. g. Sarda et al., 1988). The Terceira trend is then interpreted as a mixing line between an atmospheric component and a mantle component with a solar like 20 Ne/ 22 Ne ratio and with a 21 Ne/ 22 Ne ratio of 0. 052 (extrapolated to solar). This value is in accord with the mantle mixing model predicted by the 4 He/ 3 He- 21 Ne/ 22 Ne relationship (Moreira et al., 2001) and is also strongly suggestive of a lower mantle contribution to Terceira magmas...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMajor volcano flank collapses {{strongly}} {{affect the}} underlying magmatic plumbing system. Here, {{we consider the}} magma storage zone as a liquid pocket embedded in an elastic medium, and we perform numerical simulations in two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry {{as well as in}} three dimensions in order to evaluate the consequences of a major collapse event. We quantify the pressure decrease induced within and around a magma reservoir by a volcano flank collapse. This pressure reduction is expected to favor replenishment with less evolved magma from deeper sources. We also estimate the impact of the magma pressure decrease, together with the stress field variations around the reservoir, on the eruptive event associated with the edifice failure. We show that, for a given magma reservoir geometry, the collapse of a large <b>strato-volcano</b> tends to reduce the volume of the simultaneous eruption; destabilization of large edifices may even suppress magma emission, resulting in phreatic eruptions instead. This effect is greater for shallow reservoirs, and is more pronounced for spherical reservoirs than for vertically-elongated ones. It is reduced for compressible magmas containing a large amount of volatiles. Over a longer time scale, the modification of pressure conditions for dyke initiation at the chamber wall may also explain an increase in eruption rate as well as an apparent change of magma storage location...|$|E

Aluminous Ca-rich clinopyroxenes (5 ' 95 - 7 " 63 wt % A 1203) {{are next}} in {{abundance}} to leucite {{in the basic}} alkaline potassic lavas from Monte Somma nd Vesuvius, Italy, and occur as phenocrysts (I to 7 mm), micropbenocrysts (< I ram), and groundmass granules. Zoning of various types is a conspicuous feature in these pyroxenes. Optical and chemical data are presented and a comparison is made between these pyroxenes and similar ones from alkali basalts. It is known from published ata that A 12 Oa fluctuates strongly in the oscillatory zones of Vesuvian pyroxenes. This can be explained as due to temperature variation in the magma, to magma variation in silica content due to contamination, to oscillations in leucite precipitation, or to a combination ofthese factors.

40|$|Abstract. Magmatism {{during early}} Basin and Range {{extension}} in Trans-Pecos Texas consisted of widespread but volumetrically minor alkali basalts (24 - 17 Ma), an alkalic mafic to intermediate composition <b>strato-volcano</b> (28 - 27 Ma), and a dominantly rhyolitic, possibly bimodal, caldera complex in adjacent Chihuahua (31 - 28 Ma). This magmatism contrasted {{sharply with the}} much more voluminous and compositionally more di-verse Eocene-Oligocene magmatism. The age and ori-entation of dikes eraplaced during this magmatic epi-sode {{have been used to}} determine the orientation of least principal stress, o 3. An ENE orientation of o 3, similar to early extension throughout the Basin and Range province, can be well documented by 28 Ma and possibly as early as 31 Ma. Faulting, consisting almost exclusively of movement along high-angle normal faults, was underway by 23 Ma. Some initial extension was taken up along preexisting WNW trending struc-tures, oblique to ENE oriented o 3. The least principal stress probably changed to WNW as it did elsewhere in the Basin and Range province, but the timing of this change is not well constrained in Texas. ENE and NE striking silver-copper-lead veins in Precambrian and Cretaceous red beds may have formed during the later Basin and Range extension. The present Basin and Range topography of this region is the result of move-ment along high-angle and dominantly NNW trending faults established early under o 3 oriented ENE and reactivated after o 3 changed to WNW...|$|E
40|$|The Soufriandegrave;re region, which {{includes}} the most recently active volcanic centre {{on the island of}} St. andnbsp;Lucia in the West Indies, is the site of a relatively recent volcanic caldera. This structure, with a diameter of approximately 4 miles, has an age of definitely more than 50, 000 years and probably of several times this age. Apart from continuous solfataric activity, there have been no historic eruptions, and the morphology of the caldera has been considerably modified by erosion since the time of its formation. The history of volcanic events in the Soufriandegrave;re region may be divided into four principal phases: the first involved the effusion of basalt lava from vents both within and to the east of the site of the ultimate caldera. During the second phase, following what was probably a long time-interval, a group of andesitic <b>strato-volcanoes</b> developed in an area slightly to the northeast of the ultimate caldera. These emitted andesite flows and, apparently, a very large volume (estimated a 6 cubic miles) of pyroclastic material, probably mainly as glowing avalanches. The third phase opened with the emission of andesite pumice fall and pumice flow from a vent which probably lay within the ultimate caldera. After an erosion interval, activity was renewed on a more violent scale, in a series of ultravulcanian explosions, and these were followed by a second period of voluminous, andesite pumice flows which immediately preceded caldera subsidence. The fourth and final phase has occupied the relatively long period since collapse, during which fifteen volcanic domes and seven craters have developed within the caldera: initially of andesitic composition, around the margin of the caldera, and subsequently of dacite lava, towards the centre of the collapsed area. The effusion of these lavas was accompanied by pyroclastic eruptions of pumice fall (with an estimated volume of 1. 23 cu. miles) and pumice flows (with an estimated volume of 0. 27 cu. mile). The youngest large pumice flow, dated by the radiocarbon method, occurred 39, 050 years ago. The mineralogy of the St. andnbsp;Lucian lavas compares closely with that of typical, calcium-rich, island-arc suites. All rocks contain calcic plagioclase phenocrysts, the cores of which generally consist of bytownite while the rims, especially in the andesites and dacites, include oscillatory zones in which the calcium content commonly decreases to a minimum of about An 40. The mafic minerals in the basalts include augitic clinopyroxene, with or without orthopyroxene and olivine, whilst in the andesites, orthopyroxene (hypersthene or ferrohypersthene) predominates. The dacites are characterized by amphibole (common hornblende, oxyhornblende, or cummingtonite) and biotite, with subordinate orthopyroxene and occasional olivine phenocrysts, accompanied by 5 andndash; 15 % of large, rounded or bipyramidal phenocrysts of quartz. The youngest dacites of the Soufriandegrave;re region are unusual in that they contain phenocrysts of calcium-poor, cummingtonitic amphibole. Twenty new analyses of whole rocks from St. andnbsp;Lucia are presented, and these extend over a silica range from 50 % in the earliest to 66 % in the most recent products. The suite is relatively rich in alumina (15 andndash; 19 %) and poor in alkalis (Na 2 O up to 3. 5 % K 2 O up to 1. 5 %), although by West Indian standards the potash content is high. The rocks as a whole are members of the calc-alkaline, "Pacific" series, characteristic of mobile structural belts. The silica variation diagram for St. andnbsp;Lucia illustrates the compositional heterogeneity of the basalts, and the gap (from 53 andndash; 59 %) in silica content, which also corresponds to the gap in time between the eruption of the basalts (phase 1) and the andesites (phase 2). The andesites, on the other hand, appear to be closely related to the dacites, forming a single, continuous series. A comparison of the Feandnbsp;: Mgandnbsp;: Na+K ratios reveals the close chemical similarity of the andesites and dacites of St. andnbsp;Lucia to those of Crater Lake, Oregon, and to the "hypersthenic" series of Hakone volcano, Japan. The Caandnbsp;: Naandnbsp;: K ratios show that the rocks of St. andnbsp;Lucia contain a higher proportion of potash relative to soda and lime than most other suites of the orogenic regions. The distribution of the minor elements in ten rocks from St. andnbsp;Lucia conforms closely to that found in other West Indian and orogenic volcanic suites, with the notable exception of rubidium, which is much more abundant in the acid rocks of St. andnbsp;Lucia than in those of other suites from the Lesser Antilles. A co-variance plot of seven minor elements in the analysed samples from St. andnbsp;Lucia provides an arrangement of specimens along the abscissa which is closely parallel to the order according to silica content, and this in turn corresponds to the chronologic sequence of eruption. The basalts of St. andnbsp;Lucia are believed to have crystallized from essentially unmodified, primary magma. The occurrence in the Soufriandegrave;re region of two basalt varieties, namely porphyritic and aphyric, is explicable either {{as the result of the}} accumulation at depth of plagioclase felspar crystals, or alternatively may be attributed to the independent development two primary magmas, of tholeiitic and alumina-rich types. There is no support in the Soufriandegrave;re region for differentiation of basalt, or assimilation by primary basalt magma, on a sufficiently extensive scale to produce the observed volume and sequence of the more acid lavas. It is, therefore, proposed that the andesites and dacites of St. andnbsp;Lucia were derived largely by partial melting of local crustal material. </p...|$|R
40|$|Erebus volcano is {{an active}} <b>strato-volcano</b> located on Ross island in the Ross sea (Antarctica). Its {{predominant}} activity is Strombolian, characterized by the occurrence of some explosion-quakes per day, but few episodes of phreatic events {{have occurred in the}} past thirty years (Aster et al., 2003) and, occasionally, the occurrence of swarms of explosions (several hundreds daily) has been observed (Kaminuma, 1987; Rowe et al., 2000). In this work we analyze the Strombolian phase of Erebus activity, looking at the high frequency band ($> 0. 5 Hz$). Our data set is composed of seismic and infrasonic signals recorded by a contin-uous broadband digital seismic network in two periods: 7 th- 28 th February 2005 and 26 th February- 27 th April 2006. The broad-band seismic stations are equipped with three-components seismometers Guralp CMG 40 -T, with linear-response in the range [0. 03 - 50]Hz; the infrasonic signals are record-ed by microphones providing data in the frequency range [0. 05 - 20] Hz (Aster et al., 2004). Both data sets are 40 Hz sampled. The seismic stations are labelled as E 1 S, NKB, CON, LEH, and the two infrasonic sensors are located at the stations E 1 S, NKB (Aster et al., 2004). During 7 th- 28 th February 2005, 54 explosions occurred, whereas 220 explosions were recorded between 26 th February- 27 th April 2006. We characterize these signals by their frequency content...|$|E
40|$|The {{geomorphology}} of Heard Island-McDonald Island {{is primarily}} {{the product of}} close interplay between volcanism, glaciation, and vigorous marine processes in a stormy sub-Antarctic environment. The dominant landform is the <b>strato-volcano</b> Big Ben (2745 m), which is the highest mountain on Australian territory outside Antarctica. Other volcanic landforms include scoria cones, domes, open vertical volcanic conduits, lava flows and lava tubes. Volcanic activity is ongoing from the summit of Big Ben, and from Samarang Hill on McDonald Island. Early, but unproven, glacial sediments may exist within the Late Miocene - Early Pliocene Drygalski Formation, which forms a 300 m high plateau along the northern coast of Heard Island. Growth of the present glaciers, some of which reach sea level, has been a response to progressive growth of the volcanoes. A variety of erosional and depositional glacial landforms is present, including major lateral moraines and extensive hummocky moraines. Vigorous longshore drift and an abundant sediment supply have produced a large spit at the downdrift end of the island, and formed bars from reworked glacigenic sediment that now impound proglacial estuarine lagoons, {{some of which have}} grown rapidly over recent decades as tidewater glaciers have retreated. Integrated study of the volcanic, glacial and coastal sequences offers the possibility of constructing a well-dated record of climate change. Research into the geomorphology, surficial sediments, and contemporary geomorphological processes, including glaciofluvial sediment flux, is also important as an aid to environmental management on land, and to management of the adjacent marine environment...|$|E
40|$|This study aims at {{understanding}} the spatial distribution {{and characteristics of}} the frozen and unfrozen terrain in an alluvial fan on Deception Island, which is an active <b>strato-volcano</b> located in the Bransfield Strait (South Shetland Islands) with recent eruptions in 1967, 1969 and 1970. The alluvial fan is dominated by debris-flow, run-off and rock fall processes and permafrost occurs in several parts {{in the vicinity of}} anomalous geothermal heat flux. The aim is to assess the ways volcanic activity controls permafrost development and associated geomorphic dynamics using shallow subsurface, surface and air temperature measurements as well as thaw depth and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys. Results show a temperature increase with depth in {{the lower part of the}} fan reaching 13 °C at 0. 80 m depth, without the presence of permafrost. The shallow borehole located at this site showed a stable thermal stratification all year-round, with only the upper 0. 20 m reacting to meteorological forcing. In the upper part of the alluvial fan and debris cones, c. 100 m from the coast, frozen ground is present at c. 0. 70 m depth. There, the shallow borehole shows a good coupling with air temperatures and the thermal regime favours the presence of permafrost. ERT shows the lowest resistivity values in the lower part of the alluvial fan and a highly resistivity zone in the upper sector of the fan and in the debris cones. These large variations in resistivity mark the presence of a saline water wedge from the sea into the fan, reaching frozen ground conditions about 100 m inland. It can be shown that the volcano-hydrothermal activity only inhibits frost development very locally, with frozen ground conditions occurring about 100 m away...|$|E
40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} how Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image analysis can successfully {{be used for}} supporting disaster and crisis-management concerning volcanic eruptions. In October/November 2010 the <b>strato-volcano</b> Mt. Merapi erupted leading to about 300 deaths and more than 380 000 refugees. Satellite imagery {{can be a very}} useful source to derive rapid crisis information for post-disaster relief efforts. Modern, space borne radar sensors like TerraSAR-X can deliver very high resolution remote sensing data, at almost any weather condition, with a fast site access time. Little work has been done in detection of pyroclastic flow deposits by using very high resolution SAR. To increase the knowledge in that issue this work has been realized. The TerraSAR-X images used in this work were acquired on 26 October 2010 and 6 November 2010 in StripMap Mode with a ground resolution of three meters. Change detection analysis is performed for supporting semi-automated image classification. This is done by using multitemporal color-composites, normalized change and interferometric coherence indices. Subsequently, the disaster extent is mapped by an object-based image analysis, using the software eCognition. Based on the disaster extent map, a damage assessment is performed by an intersection operation which employs governmental land-use maps. Finally, the SAR-based image analysis results are validated with optical imagery. A WorldView image, acquired on 11 November 2010, is used for this reason. The validation shows a close agreement between the SAR and the optical-based disaster extent, concerning the inner part of the pyroclastic flow deposit. The outer part with burnt leaves but still existing tree trunks was well detected by the optical sensor, but poorly with the SAR sensor. In summary, the presented methods make it possible to rapidly map the disaster extent and to perform a damage assessment in order to assist disaster and crisis-management concerning volcanic eruptions...|$|E
30|$|The Cimino and Vico {{volcanic}} {{districts are}} different from each other, both their evolution and type of the magmas they produced. The volcanism in Cimino district {{is related to the}} acidic-felsic cycle of the Tuscany Magmatic Province consisting SiO 2 rich magma, while Vico district shows the K-alkaline cycle volcanism of the Roman Magmatic Province (Coli et al. 1991; Perini et al. 2000). The Vico complex, located at south part of the Cimino volcanic complex, consists of a <b>strato-volcano</b> with a central caldera depression housing lake Vico (Figure  1). This complex was characterized by explosive volcanic activity, which was developed between 0.8 and 0.4 Ma ago. The products of Vico volcanic activity include leucitites, phono-tephrites and leucite-phonolites, while Cimino complex are mainly composed of latites and trachytes (Borghetti et al. 1983). The basement of Cimini and Vico volcanic constituted by sedimentary rocks, the Upper Cretaceous-Oligocene flysch and the Triassic- Paleogene carbonate rocks, (Cimarelli and De Rita 2006). According to previous studies, a continuous volcanic aquifer, discharges mainly into streams and springs, and several limited discontinuous perched aquifers are found in the area (Boni et al. 1986; Capelli et al. 2005; Baiocchi et al. 2007). The mean yield of the volcanic aquifer has been estimated to be between 5 and 7 m 3 /s. The aquifer system of Cimini and Vico volcanic area is limited by the Pliocene-Pleistocene sedimentary complex on its eastern edge and by the Upper Cretaceous-Oligocene Flysch on its western and south-western sides (Figure  1). A second deeper carbonate aquifer, located in the thick sequence of Mesozoic limestones, has been also found in the area, which consist of the Triassic-Palaeogene carbonate rocks hosting a thermal reserviour (Chiocchini et al. 2010 Baiocchi et al. 2012). The volcanic aquifer rests on the carbonate aquifer and separated by low-permeability Pliocene-Pleistocene and Upper Cretaceous-Oligocene sedimentary rocks (Baiocchi et al. 2007). The thermal water of carbonate aquifer is characterized by high salinity and temperature. In the west part of Viterbo, the volcanic basement has been uplifted and reduced the thickness of sedimentary rocks. The thermal waters rise up from the carbonate aquifer through the normal faults and joints and undergo mixing with cold waters (Piscopo et al. 2006).|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a global French program oriented towards the development of renewable energies, Martinique Island (Lesser Antilles, France) has been extensively investigated (from 2012 to 2013) through an integrated multi-methods approach, with the aim to define precisely the potential geothermal ressources, previously highlighted (Sanjuan et al., 2003). Amongst the common investigation methods deployed, we carried out three magnetotelluric (MT) surveys located above three of the most promising geothermal fields of Martinique, namely the Anses d'Arlet, the Montagne Pelée and the Pitons du Carbet prospects. A total of about 100 MT stations were acquired showing single or multi-dimensional behaviors and static shift effects. After processing data with remote reference, 3 -D MT inversions of the four complex elements of MT impedance tensor without pre-static-shift correction, have been performed for each sector, providing three 3 -D resistivity models down to about 12 to 30 km depth. The sea coast effect has been taken into account in the 3 -D inversion through generation of a 3 -D resistivity model including the bathymetry around Martinique from the coast up to a distance of 200 km. The forward response of the model is used to calculate coast effect coefficients that are applied to the calculated MT response during the 3 -D inversion process for comparison with the observed data. 3 -D resistivity models of each sector, which are inherited from different geological history, show 3 -D resistivity distribution and specificities related to its volcanological history. In particular, the geothermal field related to the Montagne Pelée <b>strato-volcano,</b> is characterized by a quasi ubiquitous conductive layer and quite monotonic typical resistivity distribution making interpretation difficult in terms of geothermal targets. At the opposite, the resistivity distribution of Anse d'Arlet area is radically different and geothermal target is thought to be connected to a not so deep resistive intrusion elongated along a main structural axis. Beside these interesting deep structures, we demonstrate, after analyzing the results of the recent heliborne TEM survey covering the whole Martinique, that surface resistivity distribution obtained from 3 -D inversion reproduce faithfully the resistivity distribution observed by TEM. In spite of a very different sampling scale, this comparison illustrates the ability of 3 -D MT inversion to take into account and reproduce static shift effects in the sub-surface resistivity distribution.

40|$|Ventotene {{island is}} located {{in the eastern part of}} the Pontine Archipelago (Latium, Italy). Ventotene {{represents}} the south-eastern flank of a <b>strato-volcano</b> formed by the superimposition of deposits ejected during both effusive and explosive eruptions, over the last 800. 000 years of activity. As regards lithology, the Ventotene island may be subdivided into three sector: a lower part, mostly formed of lava deposits, which reaches its maximum thickness at the southern end of the island, at Capo Arco; an intermediate part, mostly pyroclastic, which forms the central part of the island, overlying the lava series; finally, the upper part, which forms the northern sector of the island, represented by reworked volcanic materials. The whole succession dips toward the NE, with its maximum thickness at Capo Arco, and its minimum at the level of the inhabited part of Ventotene. From a morphological standpoint, the island is characterized by the presence of a slightly dipping plateau, bordered by cliffs with height ranging between 130 m (in the southern sector) and 10 m (in the northern sector). The plateau surface is grooved with flat-bottomed valleys, formed along some the principal of the underlying tuff. The island is affected by a continuous activity of erosional and mass instability processes, caused by exogenous agents (sea wave action, wind abrasion and erosion due to runoff and infiltration water), that are at the origin of a long sequence of erosion and landslides. Even the island geological setup, the rock slide occur mostly along the entire perimeter of the island, in the tuff formation with fall, toppling and sliding mechanisms. The progressive evolution of the cliffs through such processes is heavily reducing the size of the island, at the same time threatening and causing damage to the precious cultural heritage of the Roman era. Considering the high coastal landslide risk and scarce economic resources, it is necessary to define automated procedures which, beginning with field data collected in sample areas, might identify area of highest risk. This article will, therefore, propose a quantitative method for the analysis of landslides based on the application of the Matheson test, implemented in a GIS environment. More specifically, we have developed a computational algorithm based on geomechanical surveys, carried out on different areas of the island for commercial purposes, and considering four failure mechanisms (planar sliding, wedge slip, flexural tipping and tilting block), which have enabled the elaboration of a landslide hazard map in stone formations of tuff cliffs on the island of Ventotene...|$|E
