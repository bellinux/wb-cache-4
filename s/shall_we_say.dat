Its content focuses on the public struggles Jackson went through just prior to its production. In the songs [...] "Scream" [...] and [...] "Tabloid Junkie", along with the ballad [...] "You Are Not Alone", Jackson directs much of his anger and personal hurt at the media. In the track [...] "D.S.", Jackson launches a verbal attack against a character who is often cited to be Tom Sneddon, the District Attorney that requested his strip search. He describes the person as an antisocial white supremacist who wanted to [...] "get my ass, dead or alive". Of the song, Sneddon said, [...] "I have not, <b>shall</b> <b>we</b> <b>say,</b> done him the honor of listening to it, but I’ve been told that it ends with the sound of a gunshot." [...] In the introspective ballad [...] "Stranger in Moscow", Jackson laments his [...] "swift and sudden fall from grace". He completed the video that was originally supposed to accompany Addams Family Values and released it as Ghosts; the finished video included a framing story about an eccentric maestro who entertains children and is pursued by a bigoted local official.|$|E

However, they ended up saying that the song works. Neil Miller, Jr. of UR Chicago called [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] an undeniable standout on the record thanks to its [...] "serious bass to rattle your trunk, some tweaked out synth stabs, and Hilson's bad bitch attitude."

Taylor, author of Nots: Religion and Postmodernism, felt that [...] "Keep It Together" [...] was a [...] "striking instance of her repeated invocation of family values". He believed that Madonna's fascination for family {{was reflected in}} the song. Carol Benz, {{one of the authors of}} The Madonna Connection, believed that the song was successful in asserting the necessity of family ties. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of [...] described the track as [...] "an uptempo romp about the trials and tribulations, and the joys of having a family." [...] Martha Bayles, author of Hole In Our Soul, felt that [...] "Keep It Together" [...] failed to become an anthem for emotional commitment, because of the funk nature of the song. Madonna, Unauthorizeds writer Christopher Anderson proclaimed the track as a worthy number-one single, and complimented the song's theme of allegiance to one's family, despite the turmoil and dissensions that occur. Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, described it as an [...] "upbeat meditation on sibling power" [...] and believed that the purpose behind the song was to present a homey image of brothers and sisters happy and together, and Madonna's need to restore bonds and relationships that had become fraught or distant in her life then. Hadley Freeman from The Guardian described [...] "Keep It Together" [...] as [...] "amazing, purely for being Madonna's take on Sister Sledge's 'We Are Family', a concept no one foresaw, and the fact that she later disowned various members of her family gives it, <b>shall</b> <b>we</b> <b>say,</b> an interesting tinge of irony." ...|$|E
500|$|Workman, {{herself an}} ardent feminist and a {{supporter}} of women's suffrage, wanted her readers to understand how her contributions and achievements reflected all women's potential. In her writings, Workman described herself as [...] "questioning or violating the norms of Victorian female propriety". She demonstrated that women were strong enough to thrive outside the home by showing {{how easy it was}} for her to endure strenuous physical activities like bicycling long distances in hot, humid places or mountaineering in cold temperatures and high altitudes. Workman challenged a masculine realm; her obituary in the Alpine Journal alluded to the challenges she faced, saying that she [...] "felt that she suffered from 'sex antagonism'". The author of the piece added: [...] "it is possible that some unconscious feeling let us say of the novelty of a woman's intrusion into the domain of exploration so long reserved to man, may in some quarters have existed... there tended to arise... an atmosphere <b>shall</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> of aloofness?" [...] However, in her study of Victorian mountaineering, Ann Colley suggests that gender discrimination was more overt at lower elevations and in regular life than at higher elevations, such as in the Himalaya. Colley states, [...] "Away from such petty opinion emanating from society pressures, up high, above the snow line or in distant regions, women climbers could more fully experience equality and power... If they chose, they could be just as sportsmanlike or competitive as the men." [...] In her entry about Workman in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Tingley sums Workman up as [...] "an aggressive, determined, and uncompromising turn-of-the-century American woman traveler" [...] and [...] "one of the first women to work as a professional mountaineer and surveyor and to write about the expeditions she and her husband took to the most remote reaches of the Himalaya. She was an outspoken advocate of woman's suffrage and made it clear that she considered herself {{to be a role model}} for other women travelers and mountaineers." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Financial Times interviewer, Emily Stokes, {{wrote in}} 2013 that Silvers viewed editing as [...] "an instinct.

Stokes commented that Silvers [...] "radiates a genial warmth [...] {{it is part of}} the editor's role ... not to be swayed by friendships with authors but to let reviewers express their genuine views." [...] Silvers described some of the diplomatic aspects of the job: [...] "The act of reviewing can have a deep emotional effect. People get hurt and upset. You have to be aware of that, but you can't flinch. [...] sometimes. You say, 'No, I'm terribly sorry, I can't visualise that in the paper. I don't think it's adequate to the subject.'"

2500|$|He {{explained}} his particular ethos {{and style of}} management of CSIRO in this way: Well, I suppose I always wanted to extrapolate from my own experience, small-scale experience, and some personal opinions. I had a strong desire always to see pure and applied research undertaken {{side by side in}} the same laboratory.... And I was still very much aware that the recognition that many – most, I should say – of the really important and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which is terribly important. I think the Birch report was very helpful, and I agreed with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were going to carry out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, <b>shall</b> <b>we</b> <b>say,</b> pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research – and getting that proportion right.... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you're in charge of an organisation that's spending a million dollars of taxpayers' money every day, and that's a very sobering thought, so you had to keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO's Chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst [...] "the frustration of finding it so difficult to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms." ...|$|E
2500|$|Claims that rape {{reduces the}} chance of {{pregnancy}} have at times been made by referring {{to the fact that}} chronic stress can reduce a woman's fertility over a long term.

In a 1972 article, physician and anti-abortion activist Fred Mecklenburg argued that pregnancy from rape is [...] "extremely rare", adding that a woman exposed to the trauma of rape [...] "will not ovulate even if she is 'scheduled' to". [...] Blythe Bernhard wrote in The Washington Post, [...] "That article has influenced two generations of anti-abortion activists with the hope to build a medical case to ban all abortions without any exception." [...] John C. Willke, {{a former president of the}} National Right to Life Committee and a general practitioner with training in obstetrics, has published similar statements since 1985.
