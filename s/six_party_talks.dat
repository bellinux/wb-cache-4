Apparent gains following {{the fourth and fifth}} rounds were reversed by outside events. Five rounds of talks from 2003 to 2007 produced little net progress until the third phase of the fifth round of talks, when North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear facilities in exchange for fuel aid and steps towards the normalization of relations with the United States and Japan. Responding angrily to the United Nations Security Council's Presidential Statement issued on April 13, 2009 that condemned the North Korean failed satellite launch, the DPRK declared on April 14, 2009 that it would pull out of <b>Six</b> <b>Party</b> <b>Talks</b> and that it would resume its nuclear enrichment program in order to boost its nuclear deterrent.

DPRK is one of important geopolitical issues of USA and handled by 6 -party talk, while DPRK is also inter-Korean issue of ROK. The sequencing of the two processes has {{significant impact on the}} future of Korean peninsular and the stability of East Asia.

The future of the Korean peninsula will depend on whether DPRK could survive with nuclear capabilities in the short-term and on how the balance of power would emerge between the U. S.

This paper intends to review the geopolitical context and diplomatic relationship in East Asia region and Korean peninsula. The interests and the options of <b>six</b> <b>party</b> <b>talk</b> members are reviewed adopting negotiation framework. Possible options are suggested to make the negotiation more successful...|$|R
