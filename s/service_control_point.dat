50|$|A Signal Transfer Point (STP) is {{a router}} that relays SS7 {{messages}} between signaling end-points (SEPs) and other signaling transfer points (STPs). Typical SEPs include service switching <b>points</b> (SSPs) and <b>service</b> <b>control</b> <b>points</b> (SCPs). The STP {{is connected to}} adjacent SEPs and STPs via signaling links. Based on the address fields of the SS7 messages, the STP routes the messages to the appropriate outgoing signaling link. Edge STPs can also route based upon message body content using deep packet inspection techniques, and can provide address translations and screen content to limit the transfer of messages with dubious content or sent from unreliable sources. To meet stringent reliability requirements, STPs are typically provisioned in mated pairs.|$|R
40|$|In {{distributed}} communication networks several nodes interact {{to carry}} out services. New telecommunication networks support a variety of services, much different from traditional telephony. Each service has its own so called load profile, {{which means that the}} amount of capacity needed to complete a service varies. The services may also have different priorities and quality of service requirements. This thesis discusses overload control strategies for distributed communication networks. Further, a number of overload control schemes that carry out a certain strategy are developed and examined. The main objectives of the overload control schemes are to efficiently protect a resource from overload, to maintain a high throughput and to ensure a fair distribution of the resource's capacity among the services. Two network architectures are examined; the Intelligent Network (IN) and the Telecommunication Information Networking Architecture (TINA). For IN, the thesis concentrates on the overload <b>control</b> of <b>Service</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Points</b> (SCPs), <b>Service</b> Switching <b>Control</b> <b>Points</b> (SSCPs) and Intelligent Peripherals (IPs). These nodes are examined with both simulation and analytical methods. For TINA, a performance simulation model is developed. Further, the overload control of TINA networks is discussed.

From this it determines whether it can route the call or whether it needs further instructions. In this case if the SSP does require further instructions it sends an IDP to a <b>service</b> <b>control</b> <b>point</b> SCP via an IN protocol.

50|$|When a {{toll-free}} number is dialed, each digit is analyzed and processed by the LEC. The toll-free call {{is identified as}} such by the service switching point (SSP). The SSP is responsible for sending call information to the <b>service</b> <b>control</b> <b>point</b> (SCP), routing the request through at least one signal transfer point (STP) in the Signalling System 7 (SS7) network. SS7 is a digital out-of-band method of transmitting signalling (call control) information in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The SS7 network is a packet-switched network carrying signaling data (setup and tear down of the call and services) separate from the circuit-switched bearer network (the payload of the telephone call) in the AIN services network. The SSP asks the SCP where to send the call.|$|E

The original goal of AIN was AIN 1.0, which was specified in the early 1990s (AIN Release 1, Bellcore SR-NWT-002247, 1993). AIN 1.0 proved technically infeasible to implement, which led to the definition of simplified AIN 0.1 and AIN 0.2 specifications. In North America, Telcordia SR-3511 (originally known as TA-1129+) and GR-1129-CORE protocols serve to link switches with the IN systems such as <b>Service</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Points</b> (SCPs) or <b>Service</b> Nodes.

40|$|Introduction The {{number and}} {{complexity}} of IN services, {{as well as their}} usage, is rapidly increasing. As a consequence, the task of dimensioning the network to ensure acceptable performance is getting more difficult. This, in turn, makes the choice of strategy for load control important, not only for guaranteeing efficient use of the network, but also for supporting the desired flexibility. In traditional approaches to IN load control, the main focus has been on the protection of individual <b>Service</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Points</b> (SCPs). We argue that better overall solutions will be achieved if the usage of resources was optimized globally at the network level. We also argue that agent technology is a suitable tool for implementing this and that an agent-based solution in addition would provide increased flexibility, adaptability, openness, and robustness. In the next section, two agent-based approaches to IN load control will be presented. The first is a centralized market-oriented approach based o...|$|R

In the context of this paper we study the problem of designing this segment. Our reference system is UMTS, but the practices presented herein may be applied to other systems as well.
