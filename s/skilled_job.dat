40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women to explore the careers of young women during the {{transitional}} decade of the 1970 s. The paper pays particular attention to women in skilled, traditionally male occupations. Contrary to human capital theory predictions, women with high initial labor force attachment entered <b>skilled</b> <b>jobs</b> in the traditionally female sector rather than <b>skilled</b> <b>jobs</b> in the traditionally male sector. The women most likely to enter <b>skilled</b> male <b>jobs</b> were those with low initial labor force attachment who entered <b>skilled</b> <b>jobs</b> later in life. Women experienced mixed success in <b>skilled</b> male <b>jobs.</b> Those who entered <b>skilled</b> male <b>jobs</b> {{were less likely to}} make long-term careers in these jobs than were women who entered <b>skilled</b> non-male <b>jobs.</b> On the other hand, women who remained in <b>skilled</b> male <b>jobs</b> earned considerably more than did other women. Women's chances of remaining in <b>skilled</b> male <b>jobs</b> from year to year increased over the decade of the 1970 s, suggesting that prospects for women in these jobs improved over the decade.

40|$|Please do not quote without {{permission}} This paper investigates {{the role that}} pre-immigration skills play in immigrants job-finding pro-cesses in Germany. We first show theoretically that the job-finding rate for the high-skilled depends on which jobs {{they are prepared to}} take up: if they are only willing to take up <b>skilled</b> <b>jobs</b> (ex post segmented matching), they might actually need longer than the low-skilled to find a job. If they are prepared to accept both unskilled as well as <b>skilled</b> <b>jobs</b> (cross-skill matching), then their expected time to find a job is lower compared to that of the low-skilled. Allowing for on-the-job search can lead to high-skilled finding <b>skilled</b> <b>jobs</b> even faster. We then provide empirical evidence by studying the labour-market integration process of Ethnic Germans, one of the largest immigration groups in Germany, using novel German administrative data. Applying proportional hazard models, our estimates generally support the theoretical predictions: if the high-skilled only search for <b>skilled</b> <b>jobs,</b> the likelihood of finding a job is about 50 % lower com-pared to the low-skilled. In case of cross-skill matching, the job finding rate of the high- and low-skilled does not differ significantly. Furthermore, using a timing-of-events model, we find evidence that low-skilled jobs serve as a stepping stone for high-skilled to find skilled employ-ment...|$|R

40|$|During the US Industrial Revolution, {{educational}} expansion {{may have}} created <b>skilled</b> <b>jobs</b> through innovation and skill upgrading or reduced <b>skilled</b> <b>jobs</b> by mechanizing production. Such arguments contradict classic sociological work that treats {{education as a}} sorting mechanism, allocating individuals to fixed occupa-tions. I capitalize on state differences in the timing of compulsory school attendance laws to ask whether raising the minimum level of schooling: (1) increased school attendance rate; or (2) shifted state occupational distributions away from agricultural toward skilled and non-manual occupation categories. Using state-level panel data constructed from 1850 – 1930 censuses and state-year fixed effects models, I find that compulsory laws significantly increased school attendance rates, particularly among lower-class children, and shifted the categorical distribution toward skilled and non-manual occupations. Thus, rather than deskilling through mechanization, raising the minimum level of education seems to have created <b>skilled</b> <b>jobs</b> and raised the occu-pational distribution through skill-biased technological change. Results suggest that education was not merely a sorting mechanism, supporting the importance of educa-tion as an institution even {{around the turn of}} the century...|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{constructing}} and properly burning a funeral pyre is a skilled task.  Often, pyres would not burn with enough heat to properly cremate human remains.  Pyres {{had to be}} maintained by stoking the flame and raking the pyre to allow good oxygen flow.  Ancient literature refers to the <b>skilled</b> <b>job</b> of an ustor, meaning a professional pyre builder derived from the Latin word uro which means, to burn.  However, regardless of professional build, pyres were unpredictable and would go wrong on a regular basis.  The Elder Pliny writes of extreme cases in which bodies have been thrown from the pyre from {{the force of the}} flames. Other cases, involving deceased victims of poisoning, resulted in the human body bursting open and dousing the pyre.|$|E

50|$|The duties a waiter, wait {{staff or}} server partakes in can be tedious and {{challenging}} but {{are vital to}} the success of the restaurant. Such duties include: preparing a section of tables before guests sit down (e.g., changing the tablecloth, putting out new utensils, cleaning chairs, etc.); offering cocktails, specialty drinks, wine, beer or other beverages; recommending food options; requesting the chef to make changes in how food is prepared; pre-clearing the tables; and serving food and beverages to customers. In some higher-end restaurants, servers have a good knowledge of the wine list and can recommend food-wine pairings. At more expensive restaurants, servers memorize the ingredient list for the dishes and the manner in which the food is prepared; for example, if the menu lists marinated beef, the customer might ask what the beef is marinated in, for how long, and what cut of beef is used in the dish. Silver service staff are specially trained to serve at banquets or high-end restaurants. These servers follow specific rules and service guidelines which makes it a <b>skilled</b> <b>job.</b> They generally wear black and white with a long, white apron (extending from the waist to ankle).|$|E

5000|$|Several {{scholars}} have found strong {{evidence for the}} presence of the local multiplier effect. Within tradable industries, Enrico Moretti discovered that, for each additional <b>skilled</b> <b>job</b> created, 2.5 jobs were also generated in the local non-tradable goods and services sectors, and an additional unskilled job created 1 job in the local non-tradable sector. [...] Highly skilled sectors such as technology have the highest multiplier effect with five non-tradable jobs for each technology job. Moretti cites the example of Apple Computers which directly employs only 13,000 workers but generates 60,000 additional service jobs in the area. Of those 60,000, 36,000 are unskilled, such as restaurant or retail workers, while 24,000 are skilled jobs such as doctors or lawyers.Other academics have taken issue with the large magnitude of the local multiplier effect claimed by Moretti. One study reanalyzes the claim of Enrico Moretti that five non-tradable jobs are created for each highly skilled tradable job. Using a modified version of Moretti’s method it found that the true multiplier effect was only 1.02 non-tradable jobs created. Furthermore the study finds that there is no difference on the local multiplier effect between whether the tradable job is skilled or unskilled.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "by new machines" [...] {{effect is}} now rarely {{discussed}} by economists; {{it is often}} accepted that Marx successfully refuted it. Even pessimists often concede that product innovation associated with the [...] "by new products" [...] effect can sometimes {{have a positive effect}} on employment. An important distinction can be drawn between 'process' and 'product' innovations. Evidence from Latin America seems to suggest that product innovation significantly contributes to the employment growth at the firm level, more so than process innovation. The extent to which the other effects are successful in compensating the workforce for job losses has been extensively debated throughout the history of modern economics; the issue is still not resolved. One such effect that potentially complements the compensation effect is job multiplier. According to research developed by Enrico Moretti, with each additional <b>skilled</b> <b>job</b> created in high tech industries in a given city, more than two jobs are created in the non-tradable sector. His findings suggest that technological growth and the resulting job-creation in high-tech industries might have a more significant spillover effect than we have anticipated. Evidence from Europe also supports such a job multiplier effect, showing local high-tech jobs could create five additional low-tech jobs.|$|E
