Of course I shall have a porch and door outside of each, to keep wind and snow out. Now, see here. There, you observe, is the foundation frame now being laid down. Well, one-third of the space in the middle {{is to be the}} hall--our drawing-room, dining-room, library, snuggery, <b>smokery,</b> public-room, etcetera, all in one. It will extend from front to rear of the building; but at the back, you see, I have marked a little oblong space which is to be boarded off as a sort of larder, and gun-room, and place for rubbish in general. It will extend along the width of the hall, leaving only space for the back door." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Smokery</b> is a {{chain of}} fine-casual dining {{restaurants}} situated in locations across Egypt. Founded in October 2012, they currently have five locations, the first one being in Katameya Heights (New Cairo) followed by El Gouna Yacht Club, Marassi (North Coast), The <b>Smokery</b> Beach El Gouna, and Heliopolis.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Smokery</b> {{specializes in}} smoked salmon, also servers steaks and pasta, {{and has a}} sushi bar.|$|E
25|$|Seafood has {{traditionally}} {{accounted for a}} large proportion of the local diet. Although commercial fishing has declined in recent years, local delicacies include Manx kippers (smoked herring) which are produced by the <b>smokeries</b> in Peel on the west coast of the island, albeit mainly from North Sea herring these days. The <b>smokeries</b> also produce other specialities including smoked salmon and bacon.|$|R
50|$|Pomeranian {{farmers were}} self-sufficient: crops were stored until the {{following}} harvest, meat products were preserved in the smoke store of the home, or in the <b>smokeries</b> of larger villages such as Schlawin. Fruit, vegetables, lard and Gänseflomen were preserved by bottling in jars. Syrup was made from the sugar beet itself.|$|R
40|$|In June 1998, an {{increased}} number of persons with Salmonella blockley infection were reported from one German state. Because S. blockley is extremely uncommon in Germany, a case-control study was performed {{in order to find}} the source. A total of 13 patients met the case definition. Nine of 12 cases and 2 of 21 controls with food consumption histories reported eating smoked eel (OR 28. 5; 95 % CI 3. 9 - 235. 3). The consumed eel came from four different local <b>smokeries,</b> but could be traced back to fish farms in Italy. This outbreak indicates that eel may be a vehicle for salmonella infection and that the smoking process may not eliminate bacterial contamination from raw fish...|$|R

5000|$|In 1951 Heyboer was so {{struck by}} a dying cat that he was {{overcome}} with feelings of loneliness and felt he needed psychiatric treatment. In January he admitted himself to the Psychiatric Hospital in Santpoort. He {{was diagnosed with a}} [...] "Christus complex". This period was another important turning point in his development as an artist, and it was after this period that he developed his [...] "System" [...] for showing others the [...] "innocence" [...] of their lives. He was only allowed out of the hospital if he had a place to live, and he found a sponsor in the art dealer Pieter Leffelaar and the writer Godfried Bomans who organized living space for him at [...] "Het Paradijsje", and a position as barkeeper at Teisterbant. Teisterbant was an art society, that Godfried had founded in 1949, which met {{in the basement of a}} café on the Grote Markt, Haarlem. In the summer the club met in the garden of Paradijsje, and Anton and Elsa took boating trips to IJmuiden, where Anton romanticized the [...] "freedom of the sea" [...] and attempted to live completely independently by fishing, collecting leftovers from the eel <b>smokeries</b> and bartering his works for other goods and services with friends, fishermen, and members of the Teisterbant circle. In the Spring of 1951 Anton helped form a new arts group called De Groep that split off from Kunst zij ons doel. The KZOD board was upset because they lost most of their young members and started a committee to coax the members of 'De Groep' back and these talks were also held in the meeting hall of Teisterbant. In December 1952 Anton had an exhibition of his work with others from 'De Groep' at the Huis van Looy on the Kleine Houtweg. His bohemian lifestyle ended when Anton and Elsa's son Andries was born in August 1952.|$|R
50|$|Wheels of Newport cheese are smoked whole over {{oak chips}} at nearby Bings Heath <b>Smokery.</b> This {{results in a}} chocolate-coloured rind and a creamy, flaky interior. It has a flavour of melted butter and a mild smoky aftertaste.|$|E
50|$|The Fish Quay {{was once}} the biggest kipper {{producer}} in the UK, but the fall in herring stocks has reduced the trade to a single <b>smokery.</b> A number of traditional smokehouses still exist but have been converted to other uses.|$|E
50|$|Timmernabben is a {{locality}} situated in Mönsterås Municipality, Kalmar County, Sweden with 1,276 inhabitants in 2010. Nowadays it is mainly a commuter {{village on the}} Baltic coast with hardly any own industry or service. The only exceptions are the burnt almond workshop Råsnäs, the fish <b>smokery</b> and the ceramics factory Gabriel Keramik.|$|E
50|$|Although Flimwell has no defined centre and no {{convenience}} store, {{there are}} a number of businesses and facilities in and around the village, including an award-winning <b>smokery</b> and wine store, pub, motel, pine furniture shop, church, cricket ground with pavilion, playground, maintenance garage, HGV garage, car showroom, fencing merchant and NFU Mutual insurance broker.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000 a pit-house was {{excavated}} next to {{the main}} building. Among other finds in the floor were carved stone spindles of Norwegian manufacture. Guðmundur Ólafsson interprets this as having been a dyngja, a [...] "bower" [...] or women's work-room. It had previously been viewed as a bath-house or sauna (by Þorsteinn Erlingsson) and a kitchen or <b>smokery</b> (by Matthías Þórðarson).|$|E
5000|$|The {{village is}} also home to the first pick-your-own fruit farm to open in Britain, Maynard's Fruit Farm, made The Times [...] "Top 50 places to eat outside in Britain" [...] list. Outside the village there are dairies at Northiam and Stonegate, a bakery at Bodium, family butcher in Etchingham, a <b>smokery</b> and two more pubs at Three Leg Cross and Dale Hill.|$|E
50|$|As of 2010 the Old Ford {{is again}} {{becoming}} desirable {{because of its}} streets of Victorian housing and improved transport links. New industry is moving in such as Forman and Field, a fish and game retailer and owner of a fish <b>smokery</b> based at neighbouring Fish Island. Following the London 2012 Olympics in nearby Stratford, there is {{a renewed interest in}} regeneration of the area.|$|E
5000|$|A smokehouse (North American) or <b>smokery</b> (British) is a {{building}} where meat or fish is cured with smoke. The finished product might {{be stored in}} the building, sometimes {{for a year or}} more. Even when smoke is not used, such {{a building}}—typically a subsidiary building—is sometimes referred to as a [...] "smoke house." [...] When smoke is not used, the term [...] "meat house" [...] is common.|$|E
50|$|Public sector {{employment}} and seasonal work provide cash {{flow in the}} community. Five residents hold commercial fishing permits. Almost all of Akhiok's residents depend heavily on subsistence fishing and hunting. Salmon, crab, shrimp, clams, ducks, seal, deer, rabbit and bear are utilized. The community is interested in developing a fish <b>smokery</b> and cold storage facility. Since January 2003, each Akhiok shareholder received $200,000 from sales of a $36 million trust fund provided in the Exxon Valdez oil spill settlement.|$|E
50|$|After his {{retirement}} from cycle racing, Tommy opened a bike shop {{back in his}} native Sweden, he then moved to other employment working for a mail order firm, a saw mill and then a salmon <b>smokery.</b> In 2000, Tommy was offered the chance to become team manager at the small UCI registered Team Crescent, a Swedish pro squad which was to promote Swedish under 23 riders. He has had some success in bringing through talented riders as the team evolved from Team Crescent to Bianchi Scandinavia to Bianchi Nordic. The team folded {{at the end of}} the 2004 season.|$|E
50|$|Fish {{from the}} ebb-ranks were by {{necessity}} fresher than those {{taken from the}} flood-ranks, since on the latter the tide had to both rise and fall before the fishermen could collect the catch. Since the fisherman would {{need to work with}} the tides, inspection and collection needed to occur around the clock and thus the brick workshop was equipped with bed and cooking equipment. A fish store was also required where the freshly collected fish could be stored in tight-lidded lead-lined boxes packed with broken ice. The fish from both Goldcliff and Porton were sent to Billingsgate market in London. The Porton fishery was also equipped with a <b>smokery</b> at one time, using oak shavings, but this venture was apparently not long lasting.|$|E
5000|$|The 39 km long Aģe river creek {{houses the}} Skulte fishing port (Skultes zvejas osta), where artel's ships and motorboats anchored. Next {{to the port}} was located Vidzeme's second largest [...] Skulte fish canning factory (Skultes zivju konservu fabrika) office. Fish salting workshop, freezer, fish <b>smokery</b> and cannery {{were one of the}} most modern in Vidzeme. The factory served all local fisherman. Big catches {{prompted}} expansion and construction of new of Skultes fish processing workshops (Skultes zivju apstrādāšanas cehi), and factory expanded yearly. New equipment, semi-automated lines, and freezers were being built; work organization was being revamped. If the factory only made fish products before 1956, canned fish now became its primary produce. Production was exported to many countries, such as, Great Britain, France, Australia, Mexico, etc.|$|E
50|$|The Time and Tide Museum on Blackfriars Road {{which is}} managed by Norfolk Museums Service was {{nominated}} in the UK Museums Awards in 2005. It was built {{as part of}} the regeneration of the south of the town in 2003. Its location in an old herring <b>smokery</b> harks back to the town's status as a major fishing port. Sections of the historic town wall are located opposite the museum next to the Great Yarmouth Potteries, part of which is housed in another former smoke house. The town wall is the second most complete Medieval town wall in the country, with eleven of the eighteen original turrets still standing. Other museums in the town include the National Trust's Elizabethan House, the Great Yarmouth Row Houses, managed by English Heritage, and the privately owned Blitz and Pieces based on the Home Front during WWII.|$|E
