5|$|Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, near Dania Beach, Florida, is the city's main {{airport and}} is the {{fastest-growing}} major airport in the country. This is, in part, attributable to service by low-cost carriers such as Spirit Airlines, JetBlue Airways, <b>Southwest</b> <b>Airlines</b> and Virgin America, resulting in lower airfares than nearby Miami International Airport. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood is an emerging international gateway for the Caribbean and Latin America. Miami International Airport and Palm Beach International Airport also serve the city.|$|E

5|$|American's service {{peaked in}} 1992 with 265 daily departures, after which flights were {{gradually}} scaled back until the hub eventually closed in 1995. American cited {{the aftermath of}} the early 1990s recession and the lack of local passengers as reasons for the closure. As American scaled down its operations, it subleased its gates to other carriers, largely in order to cover the debt used to construct the hub facilities, which American had guaranteed. <b>Southwest</b> <b>Airlines</b> quickly filled the void by seizing 54% of the Nashville market and making it a focus city, with American remaining as the second-largest carrier at Nashville, followed by Delta Air Lines.|$|E

These were the first international flights flown from Hobby since 1969.

5|$|Tropical storm {{warnings}} {{were issued}} for the Florida Keys, the Florida Bay, {{and from the}} Jupiter Inlet coast southward to Cape Sable on September28. A tropical storm watch was {{in place for the}} mainland north from the Jupiter Inlet to the Sebastian Inlet and north of East Cape Sable to Chokoloskee. The warnings and watch were discontinued the next day, after a direct impact was no longer expected. At the time, a flood watch remained in effect for Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, Collier, and Monroe counties into September30. An airport weather warning was issued for Orlando International Airport and Executive Airport on September 28; arriving flights were put on hold, and pilots rerouted to other airports if possible. Eight <b>Southwest</b> <b>Airlines</b> flights were diverted to the airports of Tampa and Jacksonville, and one JetBlue flight to West Palm Beach. Though airport officials later reported normalized conditions, an additional 26 flights were canceled at Miami International Airport the next day.|$|E

40|$|The US airways memo case {{deals with}} {{identifying}} {{the best strategy}} in a two person mixed motive game. The case narrates the price war between the arch rivals US airways and SW airlines in the US domestic airlines market, narrating the example of Nashville- Los Angeles route. Our plan is to consider the reality that given an honest consultant, only one airline’s pricing and passenger load information would be available for secondary data research. We found the “best-fit ” polynomial functions for the fall in average capacity utilization of US Airways, for increasing ticket prices, at fixed ticket price levels of the competitor. We then hypothesize about how this function {{can be used to}} simulate the passenger load of the other carrier given the same conditions. We test this hypothesis using market survey data provided in the case about the <b>Southwest</b> <b>airline.</b> Then the best strategy for the players is identified which would ensure them maximum payoff with minimal risk...|$|R

5|$|In early 1990, the drivers' {{contract}} from 1987 expired {{at the end}} of its three-year term. In March, the ATU began its strike against Greyhound. The 1990 drivers' strike was similar in its bitterness to the strike of 1983, with violence against both strikers and their replacement workers. One striker in California was killed by a Greyhound bus driven by a strikebreaker, and a shot was fired at a Greyhound bus. During the strike by its 6,300 drivers, Greyhound idled much of its fleet of 3,949 buses and cancelled 80% of its routes. At the same time, Greyhound was having to contend with the rise of low-cost airlines like <b>Southwest</b> <b>Airlines,</b> which further reduced the market for long-distance inter-city bus transportation. Without the financial strength provided in the past by a parent company, the strike's lower revenues and higher costs for security and labor-law penalties caused Greyhound to file for bankruptcy in June 1990. The strike would not be settled for 38 months under terms favorable to Greyhound. While the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had awarded damages for unfair labor practices to the strikers, this liability was discharged during bankruptcy reorganization.|$|E

40|$|Borenstein and Rose (1995) {{find that}} {{bankruptcy}} filing per se does not substantially affect the pricing {{behavior of the}} bankrupt carrier. In September 2005, Delta entered bankruptcy and USAir emerged from bankruptcy.

We find that financially healthy <b>airlines</b> (<b>Southwest</b> in this study) apparently {{do not respond to}} bankruptcy events, which is counter to the findings in Borenstein and Rose (1995). We also find that airlines entering bankruptcy (Delta in this study) do not change their pricing strategy in the near-term around the bankruptcy filing and airlines exiting bankruptcy (USAir in this study) price their tickets aggressively. </p...|$|R
