50|$|Another common {{single-phase}} AC motor is the split-phase induction motor, {{commonly used}} in major appliances such as air conditioners and clothes dryers. Compared to the <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> motor, these motors provide much greater starting torque.|$|E
50|$|A {{capacitor}} {{start motor}} is a split-phase induction motor with a starting capacitor inserted {{in series with}} the startup winding, creating an LC circuit which produces a greater phase shift (and so, a much greater starting torque) than both split-phase and <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> motors.|$|E
50|$|Like a <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> {{induction}} motor, {{they use}} field coils with additional copper shading coils (see the illustration) {{to produce a}} weakly rotating magnetic field. But unlike a <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> induction motor (which uses a squirrel cage rotor), the synchronous version of this motor uses a magnetized rotor. This rotor rotates synchronously with the rotating magnetic field: if the rotor begins to lag behind the rotating field, driving torque increases and the rotor speeds up slightly until the rotor's position within the rotating field is a point where torque = drag; similarly, if {{the rotation of the}} field slows down, the rotor will advance relative to the field, torque will decline, or even become negative, slowing the speed of the rotor until it again reaches a position relative to the field where torque = drag.|$|E
25|$|Low-power {{synchronous}} timing motors (such {{as those}} for traditional electric clocks) may have multi-pole PM external cup rotors, and use shading coils to provide starting torque.

5000|$|A {{shaded-pole}} motor {{is the original}} type of AC single-phase induction motor. A {{shaded-pole motor}} is a small squirrel-cage motor in which the auxiliary winding is composed of a copper ring or bar surrounding a portion of each pole. This auxiliary single-turn winding is called a shading coil. Currents induced in this coil by the magnetic field create a second electrical phase by delaying the phase of magnetic flux change for that pole (a <b>shaded</b> <b>pole)</b> enough to provide a 2-phase rotating magnetic field. The direction of rotation is from the unshaded side to the shaded (ring) side of the pole. [...] Since the phase angle between the shaded and unshaded sections is small, <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> motors produce only a small starting torque relative to torque at full speed. Shaded-pole motors of the asymmetrical type shown are only reversible via disassembly and flipping over the stator, though some similar-looking motors have small, switch-shortable auxiliary windings of thin wire instead of thick copper bars and can reverse electrically. Another method of electrical reversing involves four coils (two pairs of identical coils).|$|E
50|$|In certain smaller {{single-phase}} motors, starting is done {{by means}} of a <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> with a copper wire turn around part of the pole. The current induced in this turn lags behind the supply current, creating a delayed magnetic field around the shaded part of the pole face. This imparts sufficient rotational field energy to start the motor. These motors are typically used in applications such as desk fans and record players, as the required starting torque is low, and the low efficiency is tolerable relative to the reduced cost of the motor and starting method compared to other AC motor designs.|$|E
5000|$|Even by the {{standards}} of <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> motors, the power output of these motors is usually very low. Because there is often no explicit starting mechanism, the rotor of a motor operating from a constant frequency mains supply must be very light so that it is capable of reaching running speed within one cycle of the mains frequency. Alternatively, the rotor may be provided with a squirrel cage, so that the motor starts like an induction motor, once the rotor is pulled into synchronism with its magnet, the squirrel cage has no current induced in it and so plays no further part in the operation.|$|E

50|$|Standalone {{fans are}} usually powered by {{electric}} motors, often attached {{directly to the}} motor's output with no gears or belts. The motor is either hidden in the fan's center hub or extends behind it. For big industrial fans, three-phase asynchronous motors are commonly used, placed near the fan and driving it through a belt and pulleys. Smaller fans are often powered by <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> AC motors, or brushed or brushless DC motors. AC-powered fans usually use mains voltage, while DC-powered fans use low voltage, typically 24, 12, or 5 V. Cooling fans for computer equipment always use brushless DC motors, which generate much less electromagnetic interference than other types.|$|E
5000|$|Speed {{control of}} the fan motors within a fan coil unit is partly used to control the heating and cooling output desired from the unit. Some {{manufacturers}} accomplish speed control by adjusting the taps on an AC transformer supplying the power to the fan motor. Typically this would require adjustment at the commissioning stage of the building construction process and is therefore set for life at a fixed speed. Other manufacturers provide custom-wound Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) motors with speed taps in the windings, set to the desired speed levels for the fan coil unit design. A simple speed selector switch (Off-High-Medium-Low) is provided for the local room occupant to control the fan speed. Typically this speed selector switch is integral to the room thermostat, and is set manually or is controlled automatically by the digital room thermostat. Building Energy Management Systems {{can be used for}} automatic fan speed and temperature control. Fan motors are typically AC <b>Shaded</b> <b>Pole</b> or Permanent Split Capacitor. More recent developments include brushless DC designs with electronic commutation.

50|$|Meanwhile, {{electric}} {{ceiling fans}} became {{very popular in}} other countries, particularly those with hot climates, such as India and the Middle East, where a lack of infrastructure and/or financial resources made energy-hungry and complex freon-based air conditioning equipment impractical. In 1973, Texas entrepreneur H. W. (Hub) Markwardt began importing highly efficient ceiling fans to the United States that were manufactured in India by Crompton Greaves, Ltd. Crompton Greaves had been manufacturing ceiling fans since 1937 through a joint venture formed by Greaves Cotton of India and Crompton Parkinson of England, and had perfected the world's most energy efficient ceiling fans thanks to its patented 20 pole induction motor with a highly efficient heat-dissipating cast aluminum rotor. These Indian manufactured ceiling fans caught on slowly at first, but Markwardt's Encon Industries branded ceiling fans (which stood for ENergy CONservation) eventually found great success during the energy crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s, since they consumed far less energy (under 70 watts of electricity) than the antiquated <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> motors used in most other American made fans. The fans became very effective energy saving appliances for residential and commercial use by supplementing expensive air conditioning with a cooling wind-chill effect. Fans used for comfort create a wind chill by increasing the heat transfer coefficient, but do not lower temperatures directly.|$|E

50|$|Representative are low-torque {{synchronous}} motors with a multi-pole {{hollow cylindrical}} magnet (internal poles) surrounding the stator structure. An aluminum cup supports the magnet. The stator has one coil, coaxial with the shaft. At {{each end of}} the coil are a pair of circular plates with rectangular teeth on their edges, formed so they are parallel with the shaft. They are the stator poles. One of the pair of discs distributes the coil's flux directly, while the other receives flux that has passed through a common <b>shading</b> coil. The <b>poles</b> are rather narrow, and between the poles leading {{from one end of the}} coil are an identical set leading from the other end.

40|$|Building {{integrated}} and building attached photovoltaic (BIPV, BAPV) systems may suffer from lower performance than predicted {{as a result}} of unwanted partial shading.

This paper demonstrates the effect of shading on energy yield by evaluating power level management on the module level compared to string level. Three independent PV systems were installed and extensively monitored in Eindhoven, a reference string inverter system, a power optimizer system and a micro inverter system.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Forest and Wood Science)) —University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Sustainable {{livestock}} production in semi-arid Botswana {{could be improved}} through tree planting on-farm to provide much needed protein and shade. Such action can be encouraged if the growth, productivity, nutritional value of trees and their contribution to mass gain of livestock are known [...] A study at Malotwana investigated two indigenous species, Acacia galpinii and Faidherbia albida, and two exotic species, Leucaena diversifolia and L. leucocephala, at three spacings in a {{randomised complete block design}} replicated five times. The three spacings represented 400, 317 and 241 trees per hectare. The study was conducted over 6. 5 years. Indigenous trees were sampled biennially and exotics annually to evaluate crown width, height, stem diameter, stem number and stem volume index. Complete plant harvesting of exotic trees at 2. 5, 4. 5 and 6. 5 years evaluated agroforestry production. Leaves from all four species and pods of exotic species were analysed for chemical composition. Two groups of eight lambs were balanced for mass at selection for an on-farm feeding trial. Browse from exotic trees, comprising a 2 : 1 ratio of pods to leaves, was fed at 30 % as supplement to hay to one group whose mean mass was contrasted with that of the control group fed sorghum bran at 30 %. A. galpinii was a promising species, adaptable to planting away from its origin. Its crown width ranged from 5. 86 m in high density plots to 6. 08 m at low density and was significantly different among stands (p = 0. 0406) at 6. 5 years. Diameter at breast height (dbh) was significantly different among stands aged 6. 5 years (p = 0. 0003) and ranged between 10. 38 cm at high density to 12. 48 cm in low density plots, demonstrating a capacity to provide both <b>shade</b> and <b>poles</b> on-farm. At 4. 5 years, F. albida attained a mean height of 4. 5 m and 4. 5 cm in dbh but suffered 67 % mortality during a severe drought. Annual fodder production of 0. 647 and 0. 996 metric tonnes ha- 1 for leaves and pods of L. diversifolia and 1. 237 and 1. 431 for L. leucocephala was recorded in years of average rainfall. Yields of 0. 3 and 0. 59 metric tonnes ha- 1 were recorded for both species in the driest year. Equally good agroforestry production was obtained from both low and high density stands suggesting that low density plantings, which foster higher plant survival and reduce disease incidence, are best suited to the semi-arid conditions of Botswana. The crude protein of leaves ranged between 16. 26 (L. diversifolia) and 25. 25 % (F. albida). They were highly digestible with more than twice the calcium content livestock require. Crude protein and digestibility measures were significantly different among leaves and varied significantly at different spacings (p< 0. 0001). Pods of the exotic species contained significantly more protein than the leaves (p< 0. 0001). Lambs supplemented with browse gained 102. 33 g per animal per day while the control group gained 83. 95 g. There were significant differences between groups during growth (p< 0. 05). Growing of A. galpinii, complemented with L. diversifolia and L. leucocephala, can supply short and long term feed, and greatly enhance {{livestock production}} while diversifying farm feed source...|$|R
40|$|DISTRIBUTION: It {{is found}} as a weed, widely {{distributed}} in disturbed places, old lands, overgrazed areas and along stream banks especially in dry, hot regions. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: General: A perennial, flat-growing, creeper with an underground root system {{from which a}} number of branches develop annually, spreading around to cover the soil. Leaves: The leaves are compound with 5 - 8 pairs of leaflets. These are even woolly when young. Flowers: The small yellow flowers are borne in the axils of the leaves. Fruit: Woody fruit with strong, sharp, conical, spiny growths. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: • Plants rarely toxic - often regarded as good food in the Karoo. • During outbreaks certain camps are toxic. • Latent period 2 - 5 days. (Latent period for facial eczema is 10 - 14 days) Toxic principle: Steroidal saponins. MECHANISM OF ACTION: • Hydrolysis of a steroidal saponin to diosgenin with subsequent hydrogenation, reduction and epimerisation which occurs in the rumen. • Epismilagenin and episarsasapogenin, amongst others, are formed, absorbed and conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver to be excreted via the bile. • However, the epismilagenin and episarsasapogenin glucuronides bind to Ca 2 + to form an insoluble salt which precipitates to form biliary crystals which obstruct the bile ducts. SYNDROMES: Geeldikkop Obstruction of biliary system. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Liver. CLINICAL SIGNS: • Signs are typical of secondary photosensitivity - swollen head, - exudation, - sloughing of skin and - coronitis. • Severe icterus. • Problem of no shade in the Karoo. • Sheep stand in the <b>shade</b> of fence <b>poles</b> and bushes, or even other sheep’s shadow. DIAGNOSIS: • History • Area • Wilted dubbeltjies • Signs in large numbers for definitive diagnosis • Histopathology of especially liver and kidney. NECROPSY: Macroscopical findings: • Icterus and photodermatitis. • Liver: Slight hepatomegally and discoloured, khaki to yellow - brown. • Chalky white sediment in bile ducts and gall bladder. • Liver morphology never distorted as in F. E. (facial eczema). • Kidneys: Swollen and light in colour, with small green foci distributed through cortex. HISTOPATHOLOGY: • Accumulation of crystalloid sediment in bile ducts leading to partial or complete occlusion and concentric, lammellar periductal fibrosis. • The crystalloid material washes out and clefts remain. • Plate-like structures seen on scanning EM. TREATMENT: 1. Keep in shade 2. Diet low in chlorophyll 3. Valuable animals - barrier creams and tattoo ink will protect from sunburn. 4. Antihistamines, corticosteroids, cholagogues, liver supportive treatment. Problems: • numbers, • extensive nature of farming, • Karoo sun. Colour photos. Final web-ready size: JPEG, 72 ppi.

Two different approaches are applied in FEM analysis of electromagnetic phenomena inside the motor: magneto-static where all electromagnetic quantities are analysed in exact moment of time meaning frequency f= 0 Hz and timeharmonic magnetic approach where the magnetic field inside the machine is time varying, meaning frequency f= 50 Hz. Obtained results are presented and compared with available analytical result...|$|E
