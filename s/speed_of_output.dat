I provide estimation methods for technical efficiency of production units and the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> adjustment <b>of</b> <b>output</b> for cases when they are time-invariant and when they vary with time.

The results for the Egyptian private manufacturing sectors show that the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> adjustment <b>of</b> <b>output</b> is significantly lower than unity, the static model underestimates technical efficiency on average, and the dynamic model captures more variation in the time pattern of technical efficiency.

In another essay, I characterize a class of rules for decision-making under the type of non-probabilistic uncertainty that was first axiomatically analyzed by Arrow and Hurwicz (1972). In this framework, the agent knows the possible states of the world and the outcome of each of her actions for each state, but does not have any information about the probabilities with which each state occurs. The decision-making rules characterized in this essay focus on the outcome(s) which occupy the middle position(s), when all outcomes of an action under different states of the world are arranged according to the agent's preference ordering defined over the outcomes. The existing literature in the Arrow-Hurwicz framework has mainly considered `max'-based or `min'-based rules and their variants, which reflect rather extreme forms of optimism or pessimism on the part of an agent. In contrast, the results of this essay characterize a decision rule that reflects a more `balanced' attitude of the agent...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Non-Linear Feedback Shift Registers (NLFSRs) {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) for generating pseudo-random sequences for stream ciphers. In this paper, we introduce (n,k) -NLFSRs which can be considered a generalization of the Galois type of LFSR. In an (n,k) -NLFSR, the feedback can be taken from any of the n bits, and the next state functions can be any Boolean function of up to k variables. Our motivation for considering this type NLFSRs is that their Galois configuration makes it possible to compute each next state function in parallel, thus increasing the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>output</b> sequence generation. Thus, for stream cipher application where the encryption speed is important, (n,k) -NLFSRs may be a better alternative than the traditional Fibonacci ones. We derive a number of properties of (n,k) -NLFSRs. First, we demonstrate that they are capable of generating output sequences with good statistical properties which cannot be generated by the Fibonacci type of NLFSRs. Second, we show that the period of the output sequence of an (n,k) -NLFSR is not necessarily equal to the length of the largest cycle of its states. Third, we compute the period of an (n,k) -NLFSR constructed from several parallel NLFSRs whose outputs are XOR-ed and show how to maximize this period. We also present an algorithm for estimating the length of cycles of states of (n,k) -NLFSRs which uses Binary Decision Diagrams for representing the set of states and the transition relation on this set.

40|$|Erbium-doped fibre {{amplifiers}} (EDFA’s) are a {{key technology}} {{for the design of}} all optical communication systems and networks. The superiority of EDFAs lies in their negligible intermodulation distortion across high speed multichannel signals, low intrinsic losses, slow gain dynamics, and gain {{in a wide range of}} optical wavelengths. Due to long lifetime in excited states, EDFAs do not oppose the effect of cross-gain saturation. The time characteristics of the gain saturation and recovery effects are between a few hundred microseconds and 10 milliseconds. However, in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical networks with EDFAs, the number of channels traversing an EDFA can change due to the faulty link of the network or the system reconfiguration. It has been found that, due to the variation in channel number in the EDFAs chain, the output system powers of surviving channels can change in a very short time. Thus, the power transient is one of the problems deteriorating system performance. In this thesis, the transient phenomenon in wavelength routed WDM optical networks with EDFA chains was investigated. The task was performed using different input signal powers for circuit switched networks. A simulator for the EDFA gain dynamicmodel was developed to compute the magnitude and speed of the power transients in the non-self-saturated EDFA both single and chained. The dynamic model of the self-saturated EDFAs chain and its simulator were also developed to compute the magnitude and speed of the power transients and the Optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). We found that the OSNR transient magnitude and speed are a function of both the output power transient and the number of EDFAs in the chain. The OSNR value predicts the level of the quality of service in the related network. It was found that the power transients for both self-saturated and non-self-saturated EDFAs are close in magnitude in the case of gain saturated EDFAs networks. Moreover, the cross-gain saturation also degrades the performance of the packet switching networks due to varying traffic characteristics. The magnitude and the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>output</b> power transients increase along the EDFAs chain. An investigation was done on the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) or the WDM Internet protocol (WDM-IP) traffic networks using different traffic patterns based on the Pareto and Poisson distribution. The simulator is used to examine the amount and speed of the power transients in Pareto and Poisson distributed traffic at different bit rates, with specific focus on 2. 5 Gb/s. It was found from numerical and statistical analysis that the power swing increases if the time interval of theburst-ON/burst-OFF is long in the packet bursts. This is because the gain dynamics is fast during strong signal pulse or with long duration pulses, which is due to the stimulatedemission avalanche depletion of the excited ions. Thus, an increase in output power levelcould lead to error burst which affects the system performance. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
