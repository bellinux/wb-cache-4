25|$|Headlamp systems require {{periodic}} maintenance. <b>Sealed</b> <b>beam</b> headlamps are modular; {{when the}} filament burns out, the entire <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> is replaced. Most vehicles in North America made {{since the late}} 1980s use headlamp lens-reflector assemblies that are considered {{a part of the}} car, and just the bulb is replaced when it fails. Manufacturers vary the means by which the bulb is accessed and replaced. Headlamp aim must be properly checked and adjusted frequently, for misaimed lamps are dangerous and ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Technology {{moved forward}} {{in the rest of}} the world. The first halogen lamp for vehicle {{headlamp}} use, the H1, was introduced in 1962 by a European consortium of bulb and headlamp makers. Shortly thereafter, headlamps using the new light source were introduced in Europe. These were effectively prohibited in the US, where standard-size <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> headlamps were mandatory and intensity regulations were low. US lawmakers faced pressure to act, both due to lighting effectiveness and vehicle aerodynamics/fuel savings. High beam peak intensity, capped at 140,000 candela per side of the car in Europe, was limited in the United States to 37,500 candela on each side of the car until 1978, when the limit was raised to 75,000. An increase in high beam intensity to take advantage of the higher allowance could not be achieved without a move to halogen technology, and so <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> headlamps with internal halogen burners became available for use on 1979 models in the United States. Halogen sealed beams now dominate the <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> market, which has declined steeply since replaceable-bulb headlamps were permitted in 1983.|$|E
25|$|US laws {{required}} <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> headlamps on all vehicles between 1940 and 1983, {{and other}} countries such as Japan, United Kingdom and Australia also made extensive use of sealed beams. In most other countries, and in the US since 1984, replaceable-bulb headlamps predominate.|$|E

50|$|In 1991 for the 1992 model year, the 4Runner {{received}} minor cosmetic updates, including one-piece front bumpers and modular headlamps {{instead of}} the increasingly outdated rectangular <b>sealed</b> <b>beams.</b> This facelift distanced the 4Runner somewhat from the Hilux pickups which did not receive the same cosmetic changes. At this time a wide-body version was introduced featuring extended wheel arch flares along with wider wheels and tires.|$|R
25|$|The first {{electric}} headlamp {{light source}} was the tungsten filament, {{operating in a}} vacuum or inert-gas atmosphere inside the headlamp bulb or <b>sealed</b> <b>beam.</b> Compared to newer-technology light sources, tungsten filaments give off small amounts of light relative to the power they consume. Also, during normal operation of such lamps, tungsten boils off {{the surface of the}} filament and condenses on the bulb glass, blackening it. This reduces the light output of the filament and blocks some of the light that would pass through an unblackened bulb glass, though blackening was less of a problem in <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> units; their large interior surface area minimized the thickness of the tungsten accumulation. For these reasons, plain tungsten filaments are all but obsolete in automotive headlamp service.|$|E
25|$|Raylite reflectors can {{be added}} to PAR64 and PAR56 lamp {{housings}} to achieve a narrow spot effect. A conventional quartz halogen lamp is used in place of the reflector lamp. A spider or bulb shield may optionally be added, which enhances the parallel nature of the beam and makes it more visible when used with smoke or fog effects. Raylites are generally less rugged than <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> bulbs. The lamp can easily shake loose of the lampholder in transit.|$|E
25|$|The Taurus is {{credited}} with bringing many new design features into the mainstream marketplace. The Taurus used flush aerodynamic composite headlights, {{and was one of}} the first American sedans to do so. Originally, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) required that all cars sold in the United States use standardized round or rectangular <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> headlights, and Ford had to convince them to change the rule to allow the headlights be any shape, as long as they met federal lighting standards.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sealed</b> <b>beams</b> utilize a {{parabolic}} aluminized reflector, and {{are thus}} known as [...] "PAR" [...] lamps. Round PAR lamp diameter is expressed in eighths of an inch, so a PAR56 lamp, for example, is 56/8" [...] (i.e., 7 inches) in diameter. Other popular sizes are PAR30, PAR36, PAR38, PAR46, and PAR64. Rectangular PAR lamp size is expressed in millimeters, so a PAR200×142 is 200 mm wide and 142 mm tall.|$|R
25|$|Britain, Australia, {{and some}} other Commonwealth countries, as well as Japan and Sweden, also made {{extensive}} use of 7-inch <b>sealed</b> <b>beams,</b> though they were not mandated {{as they were in}} the United States. This headlamp format was not widely accepted in continental Europe, which found replaceable bulbs and variations in the size and shape of headlamps useful in car design. This led to different front-end designs for each side of the Atlantic for decades.|$|R
50|$|KC’s Daylighter® {{served as}} the {{backbone}} of KC's development for many years. KC designed the special patented isolated rubber mount for the Daylighter when they noticed too many failures due to the severe vibration within the metal housing during off-road use. Many hours were spent with GE engineers learning about the intricacies of lighting, <b>sealed</b> <b>beams,</b> filaments, the varied types of construction, wattage and candlepower in order to devised a way to completely encircle the bulb in rubber, helping isolate it.|$|R
25|$|At the far north-west end of {{the balcony}} is a steel ladder with safety grille, which {{provides}} access to the flat concrete roof of the observation room. A waist-height, tubular metal balustrade, with fibre cement panels attached, runs {{around the edge of}} this area, with the lantern that once housed the 1968 <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> array light located in the centre. Constructed from concrete with a flat concrete roof, the lantern is a multi-faceted, circular room, narrower at the base than the roof and glazed around the eastern half of its circumference. The trapezoidal window panes are fixed within a steel frame and a door on the south–west side allows access inside. A metal ladder on the north–west side provides access to the roof of the lantern, where radar equipment and aerials are mounted.|$|E
25|$|Parabolic Aluminized Reflector lights, or PAR lights, or PAR cans, {{are used}} when a {{substantial}} amount of flat lighting is required for a scene. A PAR can is a <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> PAR lamp housed in a simple can-like unit. Like an old-fashioned automotive headlight, the reflector is integral to the lamp and the beam spread of the unit is not adjustable except by changing the lamp. PAR lamps are widely used in architectural lighting and may often be found at hardware stores. PAR lights have seen heavy use in rock and roll shows, especially those with smaller budgets, due to their low cost, light weight, easy maintenance, high durability, and high output. They are often used in combination with smoke or haze machines which make the path of the beam visible. They are also often used as top, back, or side lights in the theatre and for special effects.|$|E
25|$|In May 1966 the Australian Government, {{responding}} to {{the changing nature of}} international shipping, granted permission for the Queensland Government to construct a composite structure comprising lighthouse, signal station and radar station, on the lighthouse reserve at Caloundra Head. The new structure was part of a pilot station scheme based at the Mooloolah River, and was to serve as a guide to the North West Channel and a signal light for Caloundra Harbour. Fully completed and operational by 1968, the new lighthouse was erected close to the 1896 lighthouse and for a time the two towers stood side by side. Constructed in reinforced concrete, the new lighthouse resembled an airport control tower. A new light that used a revolving table and comprised two stacks of <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lamps was designed and installed. It was manned 24 hours a day and four houses were built outside the reserve to accommodate the staff and their families. A similar signal station tower was constructed at Lytton Hill, making the Caloundra tower one of only two of this type built in Australia. With the Lytton Hill tower being demolished in the 1990s, the Caloundra tower remains the only surviving example.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposite}} tactic {{has also}} been employed in certain 2-filament <b>sealed</b> <b>beams.</b> Placing the low beam filament at the focal point to maximize light collection by the reflector, and positioning the high beam filament slightly rearward-rightward-downward of the focal point. The relative directional shift between the two beams is the same with either technique – in a right-traffic country, the low beam is slightly downward-rightward and the high beam is slightly upward-leftward, relative to one another – but the lens optics must be matched to the filament placements selected.|$|R

25|$|In 1968 when Federal auto {{equipment}} and safety regulations were initiated, {{the requirement for}} two large or four small round <b>sealed</b> <b>beams</b> was codified, freezing headlamp design for many years. At the same time, the new regulations prohibited any decorative or protective element {{in front of the}} headlamps whenever the headlamps are switched on. Glass-covered headlamps, used on e.g. the Jaguar E-Type, pre-1968 VW Beetle, 1965 Chrysler and Imperial models, Porsche 356, Citroën DS and Ferrari Daytona were no longer permitted and vehicles had to be imported with uncovered headlamps for the US market. This change meant that vehicles with headlamp configurations designed for good aerodynamic performance could not achieve it for the US market.|$|R
500|$|In {{the early}} years of World War II, German U-boats often escaped attack by {{aircraft}} because they spotted the aircraft while it was still far away as a black dot in the sky, no matter what camouflage colors were used. To solve this problem, in 1943 the U.S. Navy, following the Canadian diffused lighting camouflage trials on warships, conducted secret experiments on counter-illumination in the Yehudi lights project. <b>Sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lights were mounted on {{the leading edge of the}} wing of a Grumman TBM-3D Avenger, and around its engine cowling, with the lamps facing forward. The intensity of the lamps was adjusted to match the background sky as seen from an observer in a surface ship. Aircraft with Yehudi lights were not detected until [...] away under conditions where aircraft without the lights were detected [...] away. Though successful, the system was not put into production because of improved radar detection.|$|E
500|$|To improve {{confidence}} in the approach, the project made a prototype {{in the form of}} a counter-illuminated plywood silhouette of a Liberator at life size, suspended from towers [...] at a point where it could be seen from a point a little above sea level [...] away across Oyster Bay, Long Island, so that it was seen mainly over water as a sea search aircraft would be from a submarine's conning tower. It was fitted with <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lamps made by General Electric. The lamps had reflectors to give them a narrow beam of 3 degrees horizontally, 6 degrees vertically, to minimise power consumption for the required brightness. The lamps' brightness was controllable with a variable resistor. During a test in the winter of 1943, selecting a day when the visibility was above 2 miles and the wind not so strong as to destroy the prototype, the observers could clearly see the [...] thick cables used to hold up the model, but the silhouette itself was [...] "completely invisible" [...] with the lamps correctly adjusted.|$|E
500|$|Until 1961 the {{lighthouse}} was administered as a shore station, and subsequently (after the resident population of Stroma had left) {{as a rock}} station. An electric lamp with a maximum power of 1.1 million cp was installed in 1972, utilising a <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> optic mounted on a gearless revolving pedestal. By this time the keepers and their families {{were the only people}} living on Stroma. A helicopter pad was installed to enable supplies and personnel to be flown in. In 1997 the station was converted to automatic operation, utilising a 250 watt metal halide lamp which rotates on a gearless pedestal. A lens system from Sule Skerry lighthouse was refitted in the Stroma lighthouse. The old air-driven fog horn was removed and replaced by an electric fog signal which is installed on the balcony of {{the lighthouse}}. The lighthouse station's power, which was formerly obtained from generators, is now provided by batteries which are charged at regular intervals.

2500|$|One {{filament}} {{is located}} at {{the focal point of the}} reflector. The other filament is shifted axially and radially away from the focal point. In most 2-filament <b>sealed</b> <b>beams</b> and in 2-filament replaceable bulbs of type 9004, 9007, and H13, the high-beam filament is at the focal point and the low-beam filament is off focus. For use in right-traffic countries, the low-beam filament is positioned slightly upward, forward and leftward of the focal point, so that when it is energized, the beam is widened and shifted slightly downward and rightward of the headlamp axis. Transverse-filament bulbs such as the 9004 can only be used with the filaments horizontal, but axial-filament bulbs can be rotated or [...] "clocked" [...] by the headlamp designer to optimize the beam pattern or to effect the traffic-handedness of the low beam. The latter is accomplished by clocking the low-beam filament in an upward-forward-leftward position to produce a right-traffic low beam, or in an upward-forward-rightward position to produce a left-traffic low beam.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, {{the front}} of the Dakota {{received}} a new grille and hood which extended the engine compartment to better fit the optional [...] 5.2 L V8, which was inspired by the earlier Shelby Dakota V8 option. By 1992, the standard square sealed-beam glass headlamps were phased out for the aerodynamic-style molded plastic headlamps attached to the grill components. It was equipped with halogen lights, making 1991 the only year for a unique front-end for the Dakota, though it is mechanically possible to fit <b>sealed</b> <b>beams</b> on 1992 to 1996 model years, as this model year was an overlap between new grille introduction and new headlamp introduction. Also debuting in 1991 were six-bolt wheels (replacing the earlier five-bolt wheels) based on Dodge's marketing attempting to differentiate the Dakota from competing manufacturers' trucks and the upcoming introduction of the redesigned Ram, and 1991 was also the first year for an optional driver-side airbag (made standard in 1994) and the last year for the Dakota convertible.|$|R
2500|$|A {{parabolic}} aluminized {{reflector lamp}} (also PARCAN light, PARcan, or simply PAR) {{is a type}} of electric lamp that is widely used in commercial, residential, and transportation illumination. [...] Usage includes locomotive headlamps, aircraft landing lights, and residential and commercial recessed lights ("cans" [...] in the United States). They are identical in principle to <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> automobile headlights.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standardized}} [...] round <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> headlamp, one per side, {{was required}} for all vehicles sold in the United States from 1940, virtually freezing usable lighting technology in place until the 1970s, for Americans.

2500|$|In 1940, a {{consortium}} of state motor vehicle administrators standardized upon a system of two [...] round <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> headlamps on all vehicles—the only system allowed for 17 years.

Other American marques followed suit when all states permitted quad lamps in 1958. These lamps permitted more design flexibility. Auto stylists such as Virgil Exner carried out design studies with the low beams in their conventional outboard location, and the high beams vertically stacked at the center-line of the car. No such designs reached volume production; most cars had their headlights in pairs side by side {{on each side of the}} car, and some Oldsmobiles had a parking light in the middle of each pair.|$|E

5000|$|... 1968 {{was a year}} {{of major}} change. The most {{noticeable}} of which were the new larger, higher mounted C-section bumpers. At the rear, new larger taillamps were adopted {{and were able to}} accommodate backup lamps, which were previously separate bumper-mounted units. Beetles worldwide received the '67 North American style vertical headlamp placement, but with replaceable-bulb headlamps compliant with ECE regulations rather than the US <b>sealed</b> <b>beams.</b> Other improvements were a new outside gas filler with spring-loaded flap, eliminating the need to open the trunk to refuel.

50|$|Modern {{emergency}} lighting is installed {{in virtually every}} commercial and high occupancy residential building. The lights consist {{of one or more}} incandescent bulbs or one or more clusters of high-intensity light-emitting diodes (LED). The {{emergency lighting}} heads are usually either PAR 36 <b>sealed</b> <b>beams</b> or wedge base lamps. All units have some sort of a device to focus and intensify the light they produce. This can either be {{in the form of a}} plastic cover over the fixture, or a reflector placed behind the light source. Most individual light sources can be rotated and aimed for where light is needed most in an emergency, such as toward fire exits. Modern fixtures usually have a test button of some sort which temporarily overrides the unit and causes it to switch on the lights and operate from battery power even if the main power is still on. Modern systems are operated with relatively low voltage, usually from 6-12 volts. This both reduces the size of the batteries required and reduces the load on the circuit to which the emergency light is wired. Modern fixtures include a small transformer in the base of the fixture which steps-down the voltage from main current to the low voltage required by the lights. Batteries are commonly made of lead-calcium, and can last for 10 years or more on continuous charge. U.S. fire safety codes require a minimum of 90 minutes on battery power during a power outage along the path of egress.|$|R
