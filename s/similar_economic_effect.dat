50|$|According to the Panama government, {{one of the}} key {{reasons for}} this road {{expansion}} project is to service a proposed deep container port outside of Puerto Armuelles. The proposal is for this multi-purpose port to include 217 storage facilities, a deepwater container, future cruise ship port, and a marina. The idea is that the expanded road and the proposed port would create what the Panama government is callings a 4 lane “dry canal” highway connecting Puerto Armulles to Chiriqui Grande on the Caribbean side of Panama. They are hopeful that it would have a <b>similar</b> <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> as the “wet canal” in Panama City.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} how to {{calculate}} diluted earnings per share (DEPS) when a firm has outstanding employee stock options (ESOs). Three possible methods are described and compared. The first is the current International Accounting Standard 33 – Earnings Per Share (IAS 33) approach {{which is based on}} the intrinsic value of the ESOs. The second method, advocated by Core et al. (2002), is very similar to that of IAS 33 but instead of the intrinsic value uses the fair value of the outstanding options. This paper derives an alternative method which adjusts the earnings for the year by the change in fair value of the outstanding ESOs, with no adjustment to the denominator in the DEPS calculation. The three methods are compared using a simple firm. The earnings adjustment method best describes the change in economic value of the current shareholders, the fair value is more useful in predicting future profits, and the intrinsic value method appear to provide no additional information to that already contained in the other two measures. The earnings adjustment method has a further advantage in that it provides an identical result at a DEPS level to that which would have been obtained if the ESOs were cash-settled and treated as liabilities in terms of IFRS 2. Thus using this method will improve comparability as cash-settled and equity-settled options have a very <b>similar</b> <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> on current shareholders. ...|$|E

Although South Vietnam's economy was almost {{exclusively}} dependent on U.S. financial and military aid due to the intensity of warfare by 1975, during its peak it had developed strong industrial, agricultural, and manufacturing output and infrastructure, with trade relations with the West and Japan. Meanwhile, North Vietnam's state-run economy mirrored that of North Korea, with large collective farms, urban industrialization, and trade relations with the Soviet Union and China. As a result, the income per capita ratio of South to North Vietnam was much {{higher than that of}} West to East Germany and may have been at a similar level to that of present-day South and North Korea, although South Korea's current economy is much larger than that of South Vietnam in 1975.|$|R
40|$|Economic {{interconnection}} {{among the}} European countries influenced {{the birth of}} a single economic space with a common monetary policy. In addition, the abolition of the gold standard represented an important external factor that followed the same path. In parallel with these processes, the conditions were created for developing a Eurocurrency market which favoured financial integration of Europe, as well as the creation of a single European currency. In accordance with such economic flows, Eurocurrency market emerged as a distinguished international financial market, crucial for the development of international banking. Thus, business entities were allowed to access the capital which represents the transfer of the international accumulation of the exporting country onto the European capital market, thereby resulting in more efficient financing of the member states. Thanks to <b>similar</b> <b>economic</b> <b>effects,</b> these processes of European monetary integrations have become imperative to other countries in the region...|$|R
40|$|Where {{large-scale}} {{investments are}} needed, especially for infrastructure projects, public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been touted as an option. With encouragement {{by the international}} financial institutions, PPPs have been promoted in developing countries, especially those facing large public sector debt burdens. PPPs can be very diverse and complex. Many developing country governments lack the institutional and human resource capacity to handle the complexities of PPPs, and hence, PPPs may not yield the results promised. Complex financial contracts, involving commitments to future payments, often reduce transparency. Thus, PPPs can suffer similar problems – such as corruption, cronyism, monopolies – faced in privatization. The transfer of risks to private contractors may be partial, with the government having to step in if something goes wrong. A further consideration is to ensure equitable access for poor and low income households to maintain political support for PPPs. Even when PPP contracts take investments off government balance sheets, and thereby seemingly improve the fiscal balance, commitments to pay for future service flows and other contingent liabilities have <b>similar</b> <b>economic</b> <b>effects</b> to public debt. PPPs do not necessarily entail lower capital costs than investments financed by public borrowing. Public-private partnership, public debt, privatization, developing countries...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop the first multidimensional measure of {{financial}} statement comparability. This measure is based on the disaggregated financial accounting components of earnings, and is constructed by applying a finer-earnings component approach (per Lipe 1986) to a popular financial statement comparability framework (De Franco et al. 2011; Barth et al. 2012). This study solves a previous limitation of the academic literature, while simultaneously recognizing information disaggregation theory and practical application. The multidimensional financial statement comparability measure in this paper is contrasted with the one-dimensional (i. e., based solely on aggregate earnings) financial statement comparability measure used in prior studies. The multidimensional approach allows for the measurement of comparability between two firms across several dimensions and allows for contrast-based analyses across companies. This framework not only more-informatively captures <b>economic</b> <b>effects</b> as they affect one company, but also enhances the ability to contrast that company’s accounting system to that of other companies impacted by <b>similar</b> <b>economic</b> <b>effects.</b> Further, using a finer, multidimensional measure of financial statement comparability results in the ability to identify the underlying financial statement line items influencing the comparability of cross-company financial statements. This comparability measure is robust to a rigorous set of analyses, including tests of incremental informativeness, alternative specifications of comparability, and considerations regarding information environment. Overall, relationships among firms’ financial statements appear more complex than aggregate-earnings based measures of comparability may suggest. The metric developed in this study will be useful in future research based on its ability to capture and accommodate financial reporting within the comparability framework. ...|$|R

40|$|Process of {{regional}} economic integration in Europe has in the last decades been determined by expansions in various dimensions – substantially as well as geographically. Market integration is thereby presented as an instrument to enhance prosperity.

This paper analyses the economic impacts of different prospective diffusion paths of biotechnology in some major application fields for Germany. Bottom-up technology information from the literature, expert judgements and explicit scenario assumptions for various impact factors are combined and integrated in an input–output framework to calculate direct and indirect production and employment effects. The impact on net production and employment differs greatly between the different application sectors and depends on the respective importance of the various impact mechanisms. The indirect <b>economic</b> <b>effects</b> are rather high and exceed the direct <b>economic</b> <b>effects.</b> These findings show {{the importance of a}} bottom-up approach as well as the consideration of the indirect <b>economic</b> <b>effects</b> for appropriate analyses of the impact of biotechnology...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of standards and standard-setting processes. It describes the <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> of technology standards – de facto as well as de jure – and differentiates between the impact on competition and welfare that various levels of standards have. It argues that most of what is claimed for “open standards ” in recent policy debates was already well encompassed by the term “standards”; a different term is needed only if it is defined clearly in order to provide a distinct <b>economic</b> <b>effect.</b> This paper argues that open standards, properly defined, can have the particular <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> of allowing “natural ” monopolies to form in a given technology, while ensuring full competition among suppliers of that technology. This is a distinct <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> that deserves to be distinguished by the use of a separate term, hence “open ” rather than “ordinary ” standards – referred to as “semi-open ” in this paper. The paper explains why open standards must allow all possible competitors to operate on a basis of equal access to the ability to implement the standard, and why this means that the <b>economic</b> <b>effect</b> of open standards may require different conditions for different markets.
