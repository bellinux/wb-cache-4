25|$|The DoDSR, {{along with}} its {{precursor}} repositories, were designated as the ultimate storage facility for all <b>serologically</b> <b>negative</b> HIV specimens obtained through military HIV testing programs. Growing initially through the routine screening of all civilian applicants, and then through the continued screening of retained military personnel (at approximate two year intervals), by 1990 the DoDSR inventory had grown to contain over six million serum specimens, and by 1996 over 17 million specimens. Standardized processes {{in place at the}} contracted military HIV testing laboratories ensured efficient management of the growing inventory, permitting the DoDSR to enforce standards in specimen labelling, configuration, and shipment of specimens which facilitated their physical integration into the DoDSR inventory. Contracts for HIV testing, negotiated by the individual military services, covered all specimens shipped from Military Treatment Facilities for HIV testing within the United States; for this reason unless specifically removed, serum from military beneficiaries (i.e. spouses and children) would also find their way into the DoDSR inventory.|$|E

Twenty ewes, <b>negative</b> <b>serologically</b> for T. gondii (indirect fluorescent antibody test-IgG), were selected and experimentally infected with ME 49 strain (Day 0). Three ram, <b>negative</b> <b>serologically</b> for toxoplasmosis, neosporosis, leptospirosis and brucellosis were used for natural mating (IFAT≤ 512). After the diagnosis of pregnancy, these ewes were distributed in four experimental groups: GI - five ewes reinfected with T. gondii on the 40 th day of gestation (DG), GII - five in the 80 th DG, GIII - DG 120 th in five and GIV - five received saline solution in 120 th DG (unreinfected). Five ewes, <b>negative</b> <b>serologically</b> (IFA < 64) for T. gondii infection were kept as negative control (uninfected) - GV. Seven days before the first infection, immediately prior to inoculation, every three days until the 30 th day after inoculation and every seven days until the end of pregnancy, clinical examinations and blood samples (IFAT-IgG against T. gondii) were performed in 25 ewes.

The study purposed {{to find out the}} brucellosis seropositive in goat in Jakarta slaughterhouse and to detect caused agent of brucellosis. Sampling was done through slaughtered goats that come from brucellosis endemic area. The samples were collected fromslaughtered mature female goats i. e serum, goat milk, vaginal swab, mamary gland, limphoglandula supramamary, limph, and uterus. The detection method was used i. e patological lession, serological, culture and PolymeraseChain Reaction (PCR) technique. The serological detection of brucellosis in goats was done parallelly between Rose Bengal Test (RBT), Complement Fixation Test (CFT) and Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The results of this study demonstrated that out of the 119 serum samples <b>serologically</b> tested, <b>negative</b> for RBT, one was positive for CFT and none were positive with ELISA. Patological observation in the Brucella predilection organs, there were 5 goat carcases showed pathological lession (vagina discharge, hemoragy at limphand limphoglandula, crumbly limph and there were pus in uterus).

This project aims to develop a fast and direct PCR-ASP method that specifically targets the GYP. Mur allele. Allele specific primers were tailored to discriminate GYP. Mur from other glycophorin alleles with respect to single nucleotide polymorphism of the corresponding nucleotide sequences. Polymerase chain reaction protocols were optimized using this primer set and an internal control primer set that amplifies the Human Growth Hormone (HGH) gene. Samples with GP.

The current standard tools for the diagnosis of this bacterial infection are serological and microbiological. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of molecular assays as diagnostic tools {{for the detection of}} Brucella spp. in water buffalo milk. For this purpose, we first compared different DNA extraction protocols and PCR methods on artificially spiked milk samples. The most sensitive methods were then used to examine milk from <b>serologically</b> positive and <b>negative</b> water buffaloes. Molecular results were compared with serological and bacteriological test results. Milk samples from 53 Brucella seropositive buffaloes (by either rose Bengal or complement fixation test) were positive by ELISA, 37 were positive by culture, 33 were positive by PCR, and 35 were positive by real-time PCR. Of the 37 culture-positive samples, a total of 25 and 26 were positive by PCR and real-time PCR, respectively. Of the 16 culture-negative samples, 8 were positive by PCR and 9 by real-time PCR. Thus, although culture showed greater sensitivity than PCR, some animals found positive by serological methods and PCR tested negative by milk culture. The combined use of bacteriological and molecular tools increased the number of positive samples to 46. In conclusion, these results suggest that the simultaneous application of these 2 direct detection methods (culture and PCR) could be more useful than one test alone for the diagnosis of Brucella spp. in buffalo milk...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Heartworm-associated {{respiratory}} disease (HARD) in cats is {{induced by the}} arrival and death of immature adult Dirofilaria immitis in the pulmonary system and is indistinguishable from mature adult heartworm infection. Methods A controlled, blind research study investigated the long-term (18  months post infection, PI) consequences of the inflammatory response associated {{with the death of}} immature adult heartworms in cats. Three groups of cats, 10 per group, were infected with 100 third-stage (L 3) larvae by subcutaneous injection. Group A cats were treated with selamectin (Revolution®; Zoetis) per label directions at 28  days PI and once monthly for 17  months. Group B cats were treated orally with ivermectin (Ivomec®; Merial) at 150  μg/kg) at 70  days PI, then every 2  weeks for 15  months. Group C cats were untreated PI. At baseline (Day 0) and on Days 70, 110, 168, 240, 309, 380, and 505 PI, peripheral blood, serum, bronchial lavage, and thoracic radiographic images were collected. Results The selamectin-treated cats (Group A) and ivermectin-treated cats (Group B) were free of heartworms or heartworm fragments at necropsy. All cats became heartworm antibody positive at some time point in the study except for one cat in Group A. Only cats in Group C (all with adult heartworms) were heartworm antigen positive. The heartworm antibody titer for Group B was highest on Days 110 to 168 and then decreased over time and 50 % were <b>serologically</b> antibody <b>negative</b> on Day 240. Eosinophilic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytology and peripheral eosinophilia were most pronounced on Day 110 in all cats. Randomly distributed myofibrocytes in the lungs of some Group A cats suggest that precardiac larval stages were affecting the lungs. Radiographs in Group B cats demonstrated partial resolution of the initial HARD reaction but chronic myofibrocyte proliferation was histologically evident 18  months after infection. Conclusion HARD was induced by immature adult worm infection with progressive improvement starting 6 to 8  months after infection but histologic lesions were evident in some cats 18  months after infection. The serologic antibody assay was negative in 50 % of cats at 8  months and 100 % of cats at 18  months post infection.

As patients with hyperpepsinogenaemia A often overlap in symptoms, endoscopical findings, and serum gastrin values, this study has evaluated whether measurement of serum pepsinogen C in subjects with hyperpepsinogenaemia A can help in differentiating clinical conditions. Serum concentrations of pepsinogen A and C were measured in <b>serologically</b> Helicobacter pylori <b>negative</b> blood transfusion donors (127) as reference population, and in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (24), duodenal ulcer (50), hypertrophic gastropathy (5), and chronic renal failure (50), and also in reflux oesophagitis patients on longterm omeprazole treatment (28). A low pepsinogen A:C ratio was found in all patients with hypertrophic gastropathy. A pepsinogen A:C ratio above the critical value of 4. 7 was found in 14 (70. 0 %) of the Zollinger-Ellison patients, two (9. 5 %) of the duodenal ulcer patients, 11 (25. 6 %) of the patients with chronic renal failure, and in one (7. 1 %) of the patients receiving longterm omeprazole treatment. In fact, all but three hyperpepsinogenaemia A patients with a pepsinogen A:C ratio greater than 4. 7 and normal renal function had the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. In patients with hyperpepsinogenaemia A, a low pepsinogen A:C ratio may point to hypertrophic gastropathy, while a pepsinogen A:C ratio greater than 4. 7 is suggestive for the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome...|$|R
40|$|The most {{frequently}} used diagnostic methods were compared in a longitudinal survey with Leishmania infantum-infected asymptomatic dogs from an area of Italy where leishmaniasis is endemic. In February and March 2005, 845 asymptomatic dogs were tested by an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), a dipstick assay (DS), and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for L. infantum and by IFAT for Ehrlichia canis. Dogs seronegative for L. infantum were further parasitologically evaluated by microscopic examination of lymph node tissues and PCR of skin samples. A total of 204 animals both <b>serologically</b> and parasitologically <b>negative</b> for L. infantum at the first sampling {{were enrolled in the}} trial and were further examined for canine leishmaniasis (CanL) and canine monocytic ehrlichiosis in November 2005 (i. e., {{the end of the first}} sandfly season) and March 2006 and 2007 (1 - and 2 -year follow-ups, respectively). At the initial screening, the overall rates of L. infantum seroprevalence were 9. 5 % by IFAT, 17. 1 % by ELISA, and 9. 8 % by DS and the overall rate of E. canis seroprevalence was 15 %. The rates of concordance between the results of IFAT and DS were almost equal, whereas the rate of concordance between the results of IFAT and DS and those of the ELISA was lower. The results of the annual incidence of Leishmania infection were variable, depending on the test employed, with the highest values registered for PCR (i. e., 5. 7 % and 11. 4 % at the 1 - and 2 -year follow-ups, respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|When various {{indicator}} cells, including virus transformed and nontransformed cells, were cocultivated with bovine leukemia virus-producing cells, strong positive syncytia formation {{was found}} in transformed cells one day after cocultivation. The results of comparison of bovine leukemia virus antibody titers and the detection of bovine leukemia by the syncytium assay showed 89 % of serologically positive cows were positive for bovine leukemia virus, whereas no reactors were found in <b>serologically</b> <b>negative</b> cows. However, the frequency of bovine leukemia virus detection differed according to the difference of incubation periods in the syncytium assay. Therefore, {{it is important to}} choose the appropriate indicator cell and culture conditions for the detection of bovine leukemia virus in the syncytium assay...|$|E
40|$|Background: Zahedan is a {{tropical}} region in southeast of Iran. Due to importance of congenital Toxoplasmosis and absence of study evidences {{in this field}} in Zahedan, this research was accomplished. Materials and Methods: 221 serum samples were collected from pregnant women referring to reference laboratory of Zahedan. The IgG and IgM antibody levels against were examined using ELISA method. Results: 30. 8 % cases out of all samples were IgG positive and in 1. 4 % cases IgG and IgM were both positive for toxoplasmosis. Conclusion: 69. 2 % of pregnant women were <b>serologically</b> <b>negative</b> against toxoplasmosis; therefore hygiene education to eliminate risk factors especially during pregnancy period seems to be imperative...|$|E
40|$|Lymphocytes from {{seventeen}} {{cases of}} recent Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, thirteen cases of previous infection and ten healthy subjects lacking antibodies to M. pneumoniae were cultured {{in the presence}} of various antigen preparations of M. pneumoniae. Lymphocyte stimulation was measured by the uptake of [14 C]thymidine and by counting of morphologically transformed cells. The lymphocyte response to a sonicated concentrate of M. pneumoniae organisms and to a membrane fraction was significantly higher in recently infected patients than in healthy controls. However, nine out of ten <b>serologically</b> <b>negative</b> controls showed some degree of lymphocyte reactivity to M. pneumoniae. A lipid fraction of M. pneumoniae, which had a high antigen titre in the complement fixation test, induced no appreciable stimulation of lymphocytes from infected cases or control subjects...|$|E
40|$|Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the {{etiologic}} agent of leukemia in cattle and {{is believed to}} cause decreases in milk productivity, fertility, and life span in infected cows. BLV is a type C retrovirus in the Oncovirinae subfamily. It is most closely related to human T-cell lymphoma/leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) and type II (HTLV-II). Since the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides rapid and efficient amplification of DNA sequences, primers were designed to amplify regions of the polymerase (pol) and pX genes specific for BLV targets. These sets of primers consistently amplified as few as 10 copies of BLV DNA contained in a plasmid {{in the background of}} 1 microgram of either human or bovine chromosomal DNA. In addition, no amplification products were detected from cell lines infected with HTLV-I, HTLV-II, or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2 by the BLV PCR systems. Samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 18 cows, previously determined to be <b>serologically</b> positive or <b>negative,</b> were correctly identified in a blind study as containing proviral DNA by use of the BLV primers and probes. Cloning and sequencing of amplified products revealed finite sequence variations among a previously cloned BLV isolate, the wild-type virus, and the published genome. Reverse transcriptase-directed PCR with the primers for both BLV pol and BLV pX was performed on plasma from a BLV-infected cow and detected in vivo BLV RNA expression. In summary, we have developed a specific and sensitive assay using PCR for the detection and identification of BLV infections; this assay can now be applied to clinical and basic research questions in veterinary medicine...|$|R
40|$|Coeliac {{disease and}} type 1 {{diabetes}} are autoimmune diseases that may share the same initiating environmental factors. In this study, the occurrence of {{type 1 diabetes}} associated autoantibodies (GADA and IA- 2 A) and tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (TGA) was determined in patients with confirmed viral infections and no signs of type 1 diabetes or coeliac disease. Serum samples from 82 Cuban patients tested positive for PCR and IgG specific to enterovirus (HEV, serotype echovirus 16, 20 samples), EpsteinBarr virus (EBV, 20 samples), cytomegalovirus (CMV, 21 samples), and hepatitis C virus (HCV, 21 samples); and sera from 164 controls <b>negative</b> <b>serologically</b> to EBV, CMV, HCV, and echovirus 16 {{were enrolled in the}} study. All subjects were screened for GADA, IA- 2 A, and TGA. The prevalence of TGA in patients infected with HEV, EBV, CMV, or HCV was 55 % (11 / 20), 25 % (5 / 20), 9. 5 % (2 / 21), and 9. 5 % (2 / 21), respectively. GADA and IA- 2 A were found in 15 % (3 / 20) and 25 % (5 / 20) of patients infected with HEV. None of the patients infected by EBV, CMV, and HCV had GADA or IA- 2 A. All children infected with HEV who were positive for type 1 diabetes-associated autoantibodies were also TGA-positive. None of the sera from uninfected subjects were positive for GADA, IA- 2 A or TGA. In conclusion, TGA can develop during infection with HEV, EBV, CMV, or HCV, while the emergence of islet cell related autoantibodies is restricted to HEV infections. The findings suggest that HEV may be a shared environmental factor for the development of islet and gut-related autoimmunity. J. Med. Virol. 84 : 10491053, 2012.

40|$|In {{experiments}} {{similar to}} those of Humphries (1944), in which we used brilliant green to obtain smooth and rough phase variants from mucoid strains of Friedlander's bacillus, it was found that in nearly all of the field strains a correla-tion existed between resistance to the dye and ability to ferment lactose. It was found also that this correlation extended to growth rate and to growth in extreme ranges of pH. The correlation was such that lactose positive strains of Friedlander's bacillus were more resistant to brilliant green, had a faster growth rate, and were better able to grow in extreme pH ranges than were the lactose negative strains which were studied, In view of this correlation and with an eye toward its practical application, the lactose positive and negative strains were com-pared in respect to their sensitivity to various antibiotics. A limited investigation of the com-parative pathogenicity of the strains also was undertaken. It was found also that when <b>serologically</b> typeable lactose <b>negative</b> strains of KlebsieUa pneumoniae were grown in the presence of in-creasing concentrations of brilliant green, two patterns of resistance appeared. In the first, which occurred quite commonly, the resistance increased without any increased growth rate or increased tolerance to pH changes; in fact, in some cases a decrease in growth rate was ob-served. There was also no change toward an ability to ferment lactose. The second pattern occurred quite rarely; indeed, it was observed only five times in the course of these studies. In this pattern, the resistance increased quite rapidly, and with this increase there was also a gain in the ability to ferment lactose, an in-creased growth rate, and a greater tolerance to growth in extreme pH ranges...|$|R
