50|$|The United States has {{a growing}} problem with {{counterfeit}} drugs. In 2012, tainted steroids killed 11 people near Boston and sickened another 100. In another case, vials of the cancer medicine Avastin were found to contain no active ingredients. The vials were sourced in Turkey, shipped to Switzerland, then Denmark, finally to the United Kingdom from which they were exported to U.S. wholesale distributors. The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. wholesale distributor was hired by Canada Drugs, which also owns CanadaDrugs.com, a retail pharmacy website that sells prescription medication internationally, {{with a focus on}} the American market. In 2007-08, 149 Americans died from a contaminated blood thinner called Heparin that was legally imported into the United States. Investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, the Albers Medical investigation is the most prolific example to date. On August 21, 2005, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri issued a press release announcing that three businesses and eleven individuals were indicted for their involvement in a $42 million conspiracy to sell counterfeit, smuggled and misbranded Lipitor and other drugs and for participating in a conspiracy to sell stolen drugs. As part of this investigation, FDA initiated a recall of more than 18 million Lipitor tablets, which ranks as the largest recall in the history of criminal investigations of counterfeit medications. Participants in this scheme conspired to purchase and sell counterfeit, misbranded and illegally imported drugs. Foreign versions of Lipitor and Celebrex were smuggled into the U.S. from South America and re-sold after being re-packaged to conceal the true origin of the drugs. Counterfeit Lipitor also was manufactured in South America and then smuggled into the U.S. where it was co-mingled with the genuine foreign Lipitor and sold in the U.S. In addition, participants conspired to buy, sell and traffic almost eight million dollars worth of stolen Glaxo Smith Kline and Roche drugs, using fake pedigrees to launder the drugs and thereby concealing that they were stolen. There also were charges related to the sale of counterfeit Procrit, as well as counterfeit and misbranded <b>Serostim</b> and Neupogen. Procrit is an injectable drug used in the treatment of anemia and Neupogen is an injectable drug used by cancer patients to stimulate the production of white blood cells in order to decrease the incidence of infections.|$|E

40|$|Background: Immunotherapy (rhGH, IL- 2, GM-CSF) used in {{conjunction}} with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) provides added benefit towards immune reconstruction in patients with HIV. A standard course of IL- 2 consists of 6 one month cycles (one cycle: IL- 2 7. 5 million IU SC BID pulsed for five days of each month). We report our experience with three patients who exhibited sustained responses in their CD 4 profiles during treatment with rhGH (<b>Serostim</b> 6 mg SC QD), IL- 2, GM-CSF (250 - 300 mcg SC BID either pulsed monthly with IL- 2 or given continuously four times per week) and HAART (> 2 nRTI?s and> 1 PI) and thus elected to extend their regimens for a duration of at least 12 cycles (range 12 - 21 cycles). Complications included mild, self limited flu-like symptoms and minimal localized irritation, none of which prompted discontinuation of treatment. No patients were hospitalized and no oportunistic infections or AIDS related malignancies developed. A clear trend towards increased CD 4 percentages and absolute counts is seen which has not waned at 12 to 21 months of therapy (See Table). Our data may indicate that patients require continuous treatment to maintain T-Cell immunity. Significantly, all of the patients maintained HIV viral RNA less than 1000 throughout the study and two of the three patients were transiently negative for DNA (at month six and 12) during the course of treatment. BACKGROUND Highly active antiretroviral therapy combined with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), GM-CSF, and IL- 2 for a perio...|$|E
40|$|Background: Various {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the individual roles of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) and IL- 2 in immune reconstitution for patients with HIV. Additionally, in vitro studies on GM-CSF {{suggest that it is}} capable of downregulating the CCR 5 co-receptor on the monocyte derived population. We report our experience with HIV patients treated simultaneously with all three of these agents in conjunction with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). Subjects: The records of patients who had been treated concomitantly with rhGH, IL- 2 and GM-CSF were reviewed. At least five cycles of IL- 2 /GM-CSF and a follow-up period of at least three months off IL- 2 /GM-CSF were required. Eight homosexual HIV positive males (average age 42. 3; range 33 - 50) met these criteria. Methods: Patients were observed on anti-retroviral therapy alone for a period of at least three months. Subsequently, rhGH (<b>Serostim</b> dosages ranged from 3 mg SC three days per week to 6 mg daily) was added to the HAART regimen (> 2 nRTI's and> 1 PI) and patients were monitored for at least 3 months. Finally, IL- 2 /GM-CSF was initiated (each cycle: IL- 2 7. 5 million IU SC BID pulsed for 5 days of each month co-administered with GM-CSF 250 mcg SC BID either pulsed for five days or uninterrupt-ed). Viral RNA, CD 4 percentages and absolute counts were averaged for three month intervals during each of the treatment phases. Serum HIV DNA status was also monitored. Results: The mean baseline CD 4 percent/absolute count (prior to addition of rhGH) was 12. 1 %/ 281 (range 0. 1 - 25. 3 %/ 0. 3 - 724) ...|$|E
