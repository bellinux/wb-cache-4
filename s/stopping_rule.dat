40|$|Two {{studies are}} {{reported}} that investigated the {{processes involved in}} stopping worry. Study 1 found {{that the use of}} "as many as can" <b>stop</b> <b>rules</b> was significantly related to measures of trait worry and beliefs about the positive and negative consequences of worrying, and Study 2 demonstrated that the reported use of "as many as can" <b>stop</b> <b>rules</b> significantly predicted perseveration on behavioral measures of catastrophic worrying. Reported use of "feel like continuing" <b>stop</b> <b>rules</b> was unrelated to any measures of worry in both studies. These results indicate that the use of "as many as can" <b>stop</b> <b>rules</b> is a highly significant predictor of worry frequency and perseveration, and that beliefs about the positive and negative consequences of worry also independently predict the use of "as many as can" <b>stop</b> <b>rules.</b> These findings are consistent with (1) the view that the <b>stop</b> <b>rules</b> used by worriers are closely associated with, or directly derived from, the more stable, global beliefs that worriers hold about the utility of the worry process, and (2) predictions from the mood-as-input model of catastrophic worryin...|$|R

We analyze the effect of sequential <b>stopping</b> <b>rules</b> on the coverage of confidence interval procedures.

We assess the quality of different types of rules and introduce an analytical method for evaluating the loss in coverage for a certain class of <b>stopping</b> <b>rules.</b> This method includes a calculation of the distribution of the stopping time of the procedure. We find optimal parameters for absolute precision <b>stopping</b> <b>rules</b> applied to normally distributed data and use these results to suggest methods for obtaining nominal coverage with minimal replications.

40|$|Patients with work-related upper {{extremity}} pain (WRUED) experience disability {{in daily life}} activities. The factors that influence levels of disability are still unclear. Both excessive avoidance and persistence have been suggested, but the affective and motivational processes that underlie these behaviours have not been scrutinized. This study was aimed at examining the role of current mood and <b>stop</b> <b>rules</b> on physical task performance, controlling for gender, pain severity, pain catastrophizing, and pain-related fear. An additional focus was {{the role of the}} interaction between current mood and <b>stop</b> <b>rules</b> as predicted by the novel Mood-as-Input (MAI) model. Following MAI, it is the informational value of current mood within a goal context (<b>stop</b> <b>rule),</b> rather than mood per se that predicts behaviour. A 2 (mood) x 2 (<b>stop</b> <b>rule)</b> x 2 (physical task order) factorial design was used in which 62 WRUED patients performed an upper and lower extremity physical task. A stress interview was used to induce positive and negative mood. Patients received either an "as-much-as-can (AMAC) " <b>stop</b> <b>rule</b> instruction, or a "feel-like-discontinuing (FLDC) " <b>stop</b> <b>rule</b> instruction. Results showed that physical task performance was predicted by pain-related fear, current mood, <b>stop</b> <b>rule.</b> However, the predicted moodxstop rule interaction was not found, and there was no influence of gender, pain severity, and pain catastrophizing on task performance. The findings suggest that not only pain-related fear, but current mood and goal context factors independently affect physical performance in patients with WRUED. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The mood-as-input {{hypothesis}} {{predicts that}} perseveration at an open-ended task {{is determined by}} “stop rules” for the task and by the valency of the mood. <b>Stop</b> <b>rules</b> define a person’s goals in task attainment, e. g. stopping after doing {{as much as they}} can, or stopping when they no longer feel like continuing. This thesis will examine the combined effects of <b>stop</b> <b>rules</b> and specific negative moods (sadness, anxiety, anger) on perseverative worrying and checking tasks, and the influence of specific negative moods on personal performance standards. The final study explores the impact of experimentally induced mood on a worry task when the mood source is made highly salient i. e. attributed to an obvious event or source. On a perseverative checking task, different negative mood and <b>stop</b> <b>rule</b> combinations were found not to affect participant performance. However, using a personally-relevant worry task, participants in each specific negative mood condition persevered for longer using an “as many as can” rule compared with those using a “feel like continuing” rule. The opposite was found for participants in a happy mood. The effects of sadness and anxiety on personal performance standards and <b>stop</b> <b>rule</b> preference were also examined. Findings suggest a positive relationship between sad and anxious moods and “as many as can” <b>stop</b> <b>rule</b> preference. An attempt to manipulate mood attribution after inducing an angry mood showed marginally significant differences in attribution by the high and low manipulation groups, but no effects of mood attribution on task performance. These findings suggest that with a catastrophic worry task, participants in each specific negative mood condition using an “as many as can” <b>stop</b> <b>rule</b> persevered for longer compared with those using a “feel like continuing” <b>stop</b> <b>rule.</b> The implications of this work are discussed in relation to mood-as-input accounts of perseveration and models of mood...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{describe}} 3 experiments {{investigating a}} "mood-as-input" approach to understanding catastrophic worrying. Experiment 1 found that induced negative mood {{increased the number}} of steps emitted in both a catastrophizing interview procedure and a positive iteration task. Experiment 2 found that the number of items that worriers emitted in an iterative item generation task was dependent on the <b>stop</b> <b>rules</b> specified by the procedure. Experiment 3 found that manipulating the <b>stop</b> <b>rules</b> for catastrophizing had differential effects on worriers and non-=worriers, depending {{on the nature of the}} <b>stop</b> <b>rules</b> specified. These results suggest that mood provides information about continuing or terminating the catastrophizing process that is interpreted in the context of the <b>stop</b> <b>rules</b> for the task.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that a combination of negative mood and rigorous “as many as can” <b>stop</b> <b>rules</b> can be used to help explain a range of perseverative psy- chopathologies such as pathological worrying, compulsive checking, and depressive rumination (known as the mood-as-input hypothesis). The aim {{of the present study was}} to extend this work and examine whether specific emo- tions of the same valence will have similar or differential effects on task perseveration. The study experimentally induced discrete moods and manipulated task <b>stop</b> <b>rules</b> in an analog population. Results showed that perseveration at a worry-based interview task conformed to standard mood-as-input predictions in which perseveration was sig- nificantly greater when an “as many as can” <b>stop</b> <b>rule</b> was paired with a negative mood or a “feel like continuing” <b>stop</b> <b>rule</b> was paired with a positively valenced mood. The pattern of results revealed no significant inherent differences in processing depending on the type of discrete negative mood being experienced.

These findings provide support for a mood-as-input explanation of perseverative psychopathologies such as compulsive checking, and begin to cast some light on how anxiety-reduction and 'confidence' models of compulsive checking, might be explained within broader mechanisms of perseveration...|$|R
