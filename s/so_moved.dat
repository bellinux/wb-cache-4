When he orders the nightingale brought to him, a kitchen maid (the only one at court who knows of its whereabouts) leads the court to a nearby forest, where the nightingale agrees to appear at court, where it remains as the Emperor's favorite. When the Emperor is given a bejeweled mechanical bird he loses interest in the real nightingale, who returns to the forest. The mechanical bird eventually breaks down; and the Emperor is taken deathly ill a few years later. The real nightingale learns of the Emperor's condition and returns to the palace; whereupon Death is <b>so</b> <b>moved</b> by the nightingale's song that he allows the Emperor to live.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, in June 1570, the friars {{found the}} house at Duruelo too small, and <b>so</b> <b>moved</b> to {{the nearby town of}} Mancera de Abajo. After moving on from this {{community}}, John set up a new community at Pastrana (October 1570), and a community at Alcalá de Henares, which was to be a house of studies for the academic training of the friars. In 1572 he arrived in Ávila, at the invitation of Teresa, who had been appointed prioress of the Monastery of the Incarnation there in 1571. John became the spiritual director and confessor for Teresa and the other 130 nuns there, as well as {{for a wide range of}} laypeople in the city. In 1574, John accompanied Teresa in the foundation of a new monastery in Segovia, returning to Avila after staying there a week. Beyond this, though, John seems to have remained in Ávila between 1572 and 1577.|$|E

He received lucrative offers from promoters in the Southeastern United States, <b>so</b> <b>moved</b> to Atlanta to compete in match races. Chevrolet and the other American car manufacturers decided to drop their factory backing in 1963 and his vehicle became uncompetitive. He switched to a Mercury Comet for 1964 in the A/Factory Experimental (A/FX) division. He won over 90 percent of match races he entered that year. That year he made the first 10-second pass in a doorslammer, as well as being the first driver to lift the front wheels when he shifted gears.|$|E

25|$|As Penn became homeless, {{he began}} to live with Quaker families. Quakers were {{relatively}} strict Christians in the 17th century. They refused to bow or take off their hats to social superiors, believing all men equal under God, a belief antithetical to an absolute monarchy which believed the monarch divinely appointed by God. Therefore, Quakers were treated as heretics because of their principles and their failure to pay tithes. They also refused to swear oaths of loyalty to the King. Quakers followed the command of Jesus not to swear. The basic ceremony of Quakerism is silent worship in a meeting house, conducted in a group. There was no ritual and no professional clergy, and many Quakers disavowed the concept of original sin. God's communication comes to each individual directly, and if <b>so</b> <b>moved,</b> the individual shares their revelations, thoughts or opinions with the group. Penn found all these tenets to sit well with his conscience and his heart.|$|E

Louisa went to visit their wounded and was <b>so</b> <b>moved</b> by their suffering that she revealed hidden stores of blankets and turned her home into a field hospital; she personally led a hastily organized company of nurses {{to care for the}} sick and dying men and made trips to outlying encampments to bring her patients into Santa Fe or, failing that, to treat in situ those soldiers who could not be brought into the city. It was not until April 1 or 2 that General Sibley, who had been at Albuquerque most of this time, arrived at Santa Fe and personally met with Louisa. It is not known what transpired between them, but it can be presumed that he thanked her for caring for his men and reminisced about their earlier encounters when he and her husband had been on the same side.|$|E
25|$|Such {{a victory}} {{propelled}} {{him into a}} different league of steeplechases, horses and trainers. Christopher Green was granted a passport in 1850 which may well mean he was riding abroad. He rode, and won, often for 'Mr Carew' and Ben Land snr. {{and he is now}} mainly mentioned by the sporting press only when something out of the ordinary happened. For a while, though, Green had been wanting to set up a training establishment on his own account and <b>so</b> <b>moved</b> back to Littleport in the Isle of Ely (his father's birthplace) where 'he soon got the management of several steeple chase horses' but found 'it was easier to find stabling than a country to train over'. He soon made the acquaintance of Henry Jones of Aps (or Apes) Hall, Littleport which became a long-standing relationship of friendship rather than one of pure business. In the 1850s, Green and Jones, as co-owners, bought Tomyrus (foaled 1851) who had a successful flat and hurdles career. Prince Charlie, Camel, Hester, Avenger, Gownsman 'and other good horses' were all descended from Tomyrus and gave Jones fame and success.|$|E

Stone said the society’s general agent, Samuel May, Jr., reproached her for speaking on women’s rights at an antislavery meeting, and she replied, “I was a woman before I was an abolitionist. I must speak for women.” Three months later, Stone notified May that she intended to lecture on women’s rights full-time {{and would not be}} available for antislavery work.|$|E
