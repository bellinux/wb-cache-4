40|$|Calcite and opal {{coatings}} {{found on}} fracture footwalls and lithophysal cavity bottoms in the volcanic section at Yucca Mountain (exposed in a tunnel) contain {{a record of}} gradual chemical and isotopic {{changes that have occurred}} in the unsaturated zone. The thin (less than 6 cm) coatings are composed primarily of calcite, opal, chalcedony, and quartz. Fluid inclusions in calcite that homogenize at greater than ambient temperatures provide impetus for geochronologic studies {{in order to determine the}} thermal history. In the welded Topopah Spring Tuff (12. 7 Ma), U-Pb ages of opal and chalcedony layers provide evidence of a long history of deposition throughout the past 10 m. y. However, these ages can constrain the ages of associated calcite layers only in samples with an easily interpretable microstratigraphy. Strontium isotope ratios in calcite increase with microstratigraphic position from the base up to the outermost surface of the coatings. The strontium incorporated in these coatings records the systematic change in pore-water isotopic composition due to water-rock interaction primarily in the overlying nonwelded tuffs. A one-dimensional advection-reaction model simulates strontium isotope ratios measured in pore water extracted from core in three vertical boreholes adjacent to the tunnel. By calculating the strontium isotope compositions of the rocks at various past times, the model predicts a history of the strontium isotope ratios in the water that matches the record in the calcite and therefore provides approximate ages. Oxygen isotope ratios measured in calcite gradually increase with decreasing model <b>strontium</b> <b>age.</b> Assuming that the oxygen isotope ratio of the percolating water was relatively constant, this trend indicates a gradual cooling of the rocks over millions of years, in agreement with thermal modeling of magma beneath the 12 -Ma Timber Mountain caldera just north of Yucca Mountain. This model predicts that temperatures significantly exceeding current geotherm values occurred prior to 6 Ma. We find no evidence for Quaternary or recent thermal perturbations to the cooling rocks...|$|E

Assoc. Petrol GeoL Stud. GeoL No. 27, 1, 1 - 10, 1987). The condensed section of the megasequence, resolvable in detail in outcrop and on seismic profiles, comprises a basin-wide pelagic to hemipelagic limestone interval. A regional mid-Oligocene unconformity, the Marshall Paraconformity, lies within the limestone interval onshore and correlates with hiatuses in at least two, and possibly three, offshore exploration wells and with a temporary lithological change from limestone to quartz sand at a fourth. <b>Strontium</b> isotopic <b>age</b> estimates confirm that a 2 - 4 Ma hiatus is associated with onshore outcrops of the Marshall Paraconformity (between- 32 and 29 Ma), which correlates with the opening of the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean and the postulated mid-Oligocene sea-level fall of Haq et aL (Science 235, 1156 - 1167, 1987; Spec.

40|$|Osteoporosis is a {{major public}} health problem of older people. Most types of {{osteoporotic}} fractures increase in incidence with age, {{and the number of}} elderly individuals affected with osteoporosis is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years. Beside non pharmacological intervention and calcium and vitamin D administration, available pharmacological therapies for the treatment of osteoporosis include antiresorptive drugs (such as bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and raloxifene) and the bone forming drug teriparatide and drug which can have both anti resorptive effect and bone forming effect (<b>strontium</b> ranelate). <b>Age</b> does not affect the efficacy and the safety of most anti osteoporotic agents. Despite the debilitating effects of osteoporosis fractures and the availability of therapies to reduce fracture incidence, many elderly patients do not receive treatment and the proportion of treated subjects decreases with increasing age. One explanation for this decrease is the perception that it is too late to alter the course of the disease in its late stage. Given the known antifracture efficacy of available drugs, lack of appropriate and needed therapy in patients with osteoporosis may result in costly and debilitating fractures. Comprehensive geriatric assessment can help the practitioner to prioritize the problems and to adapt the treatment to the profile of frailty of the patient.

Measurement of the ratio of the amount of magnesium hydroxide formed to that of strontium nitrate reacted has shown that for compositions containing from 10 to 60 % magnesium, a major component of the ageing process could be represented by the equation 3 Mg + Sr(NO 3) 2 + 4 H 2 O → 3 Mg(OH) 2 + Sr(NO 2) 2 + H 2.

40|$|ABSTRACT. At {{least three}} marine transgressions of Pliocene age are {{recorded}} by littoral to inner-shelf sediments of the Gubik Formation, which mantles the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska. The three recognized transgressions were eustatic high sea levels that, from oldest to youngest, are informally named the Colvillian, Bigbendian, and Fishcreekian transgressions. The geochronology {{is based upon}} amino acid geochemistry, paleo-magnetic studies, vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology, and <b>strontium</b> isotope <b>age</b> estimates. Pollen, plant macrofossils, and marine vertebrate and invertebrate remains indicate that these trangressions occurred when the Arctic was at least intermittently much warmer than it is now. The Colvillian transgression took place at sometime between 2. 48 and 2. 7 Ma, when adjacent coastal areas supported an open boreal forest or spruce-birch wood-land with scattered pine and rare fir and hemlock. The Bigbendian transgression occurred about 2. 48 Ma. Climatic conditions were probably slightly cooler than during the Colvillian transgression, but probably too warm for permafrost and too warm for even seasonal sea ice in the region. Nearby vegetation was open spruce-birch woodland or parkland, possibly with rare scattered pine. The Fishcreekian transgression took place sometime between 2. 14 and 2. 48 Ma and was also characterized by warm marine conditions without sea ice. During the waning stages of this transgression, however, terrestrial conditions were relatively cool, and coastal vegetation was herbaceous tundra with scattered larch trees in the vicinity. Other marine units from this time period occur around the Arctic Basin. The three oldest trangressions recognized from the Seward Peninsula may be broadly correlated with the three Pliocene transgressions of the Arctic Coastal Plain. The Tusatuvayam beds in Kamchatka possibly correlate wit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Eocene La Meseta Formation isan unconformity-bounded unitthat {{records the}} {{geological}} {{evolution of the}} James Ross Basin, NE Antarctic Peninsula, {{during a period of}} decreasing tectonism and a lull in volcanic activity. This unit represents a composite incised valley, filled with deltaic, estuarine and shallow-marine d posits showing a l ndwards facies shift that indicates deposition during an overall sea-level rise. The six unconformity-based internal units (Valle de las Focas, Acantilados, Campamento, Cucullaea I, Cucullaea II and Submeseta allomembers) are interpreted to represent minor-scale r gressive-trans-gressive events. Geological, palaeontological and new <b>strontium</b> isotopic <b>ages</b> allow the correlation of base-level changes with second- and third-order ustatic sea-level f uctua-tions. The base of the La Meseta Formation is correlated with a global 56 Ma lowstand in sea level followed by a main episode of flooding between 54. 3 and 52. 4 Ma. The base of the Cucullaea I Allomember iscorrelated with the well-known late Ypresian (49 Ma) lowstand, and the base of the Submeseta Allomember with the 36 Ma lowstand. Correlation of Eocene sea-level f uctuations in the northern Antarctic Peninsula with the global sea-level curve strengthens the concept of global syncroneity of the eustatic sea-level curve. Sea-level fluctuations have a significant influ-ence on stratal architecture of continental margins and interior basins. Eustacy also controls hydrographic-cl imatic patterns and, indirectly, biotic patterns as well. Differentiating between the effects of eustacy and tectonics in the sedimentary ecord has been a major goal of sedimentologists and stratigraphers. Although the chronology of fluctuating lobal sea levels is regarded as a key factor in the development of sequence stratigraphy, there is no consensus about the global synchroneity of these changes. Furthermore, differentiating eustatic from tectonic events is contentious, even in passive margin settings.

40|$|Drilling at Bougainville Guyot (Ocean Drilling Program Site 831), New Hebrides Island Arc during Leg 134 {{revealed}} that 727. 5 m of carbonate overlies an andesite basement. The carbonate cap at Site 831 consists of 20 m of pelagic carbonate overlying 707. 5 m of neritic carbonates. The neritic section consists of ~ 230 m of largely unaltered aragonite sediment that overlies ~ 497 m of totally calcitized limestone. The deeper {{portion of the}} calcitized interval has been pervasively altered by diagenesis. Prior to this study the age distribution of sediments at Bougainville Guyot was poorly known because age diagnostic fossils are sparsely and discontinuously distributed in the sequence. We have used Sr isotopes to provide temporal constraints on the deposition of carbonates at Site 831; these constraints are critical in reconstructing the vertical movement of Bougainville Guyot before its collision with the New Hebrides Island Arc. Overall, the chronostratigraphy of Bougainville Guyot can be subdivided into three intervals: (1) a Pleistocene interval (102. 4 to 391. 11 meters below sea floor [mbsf]); (2) a Miocene interval (410. 31 to 669. 53 mbsf); and (3) an Oligocene interval (678. 83 to 727. 50 mbsf). <b>Strontium</b> isotopic <b>ages</b> of samples increase with increasing depth in the carbonate sequence, except {{near the bottom of}} the sequence, where several samples exhibit a consistent reversed age vs. depth trend. Such age reversals are most likely the product of post-depositional rock-water interaction. Preliminary stable isotope data are consistent with diagenetic alteration in the marine and meteoric environments. Several abrupt decreases in d 87 Sr, and hence age, of sediments are recognized in the carbonate cap at Bougainville Guyot. These disconformities are most likely the product of subaerial exposure in response to relative sea-level fall. Indeed, Sr-isotope ages indicate that 2 to 9 m. y. of sediment deposition is missing across these d 87 Sr disconformities...|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of sedimentary evolution is intimately {{related to the}} knowledge of the exact ages of the sediments. When working on carbonate sediments, age dating is commonly based on paleontological observations and established biozonations, which may prove to be relatively imprecise. Dating by means of strontium isotope ratios in marine bioclasts is the probably best method in order to precisely date carbonate successions, provided that the sample reflects original marine geochemical characteristics. This requires a precise study of the samples including its petrography, SEM and cathodoluminescence observations, stable carbon and oxygen isotope geochemistry and finally the strontium isotope measurement itself. On the Nicoya Peninsula (Northwestern Costa Rica) sediments from the Piedras Blancas Formation, Nambi Formation and Quebrada Pavas Formation were dated by the means of strontium isotope ratios measured in Upper Cretaceous Inoceramus shell fragments. Results have shown average 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values of 0. 707654 (middle late Campanian) for the Piedras Blancas Formation, 0. 707322 (Turonian-Coniacian) for the Nambi Formation and 0. 707721 (late Campanian-Maastrichtian) for the Quebrada Pavas Formation. Abundant detrital components in the studied formations constitute a difficulty to strontium isotope dating. In fact, the fossil bearing sediments can easily contaminate the target fossil with strontium mobilized form basalts during diagenesis and thus the obtained strontium isotope ratios may be influenced significantly and so will the obtained ages. The new and more precise age assignments allow for more precision in the chronostratigraphic chart of the sedimentary and tectonic evolution of the Nicoya Peninsula, providing a better insight on the evolution of this region. Meteor Cruise M 81 dredged shallow water carbonates from the Hess Rise and Hess Escarpment during March 2010. Several of these shallow water carbonates contain abundant Larger Foraminifera that indicates an Eocene-Oligocene age. In this study the strontium isotope values ranging from 0. 707847 to 0. 708238 can be interpreted as a Rupelian to Chattian age of these sediments. These platform sediments are placed on seamounts, now located at depths reaching 1600 m. Observation of sedimentologic characteristics of these sediments has helped to resolve apparent discrepancies between fossil and <b>strontium</b> isotope <b>ages.</b> Hence, it is possible to show that the subsidence was active during early Miocene times. On La Désirade (Guadeloupe France), the Neogene to Quaternary carbonate cover has been dated by microfossils and some U/Th-ages. Disagreements subsisted in the paleontological ages of the formations. Strontium isotope ratios ranging from 0. 709047 to 0. 709076 showed the Limestone Table of La Désirade to range from an Early Pliocene to Late Pliocene/early Pleistocene age. A very late Miocene age (87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 709013) can be determined to the Detrital Offshore Limestone. The flat volcanic basement had to be eroded by wave-action during a long-term stable relative sea-level. Sediments of the Table Limestone on La Désirade show both low-stand and high-stand facies that encroach on the igneous basement, implying deposition during a major phase of subsidence creating accommodation space. Subsidence is followed by tectonic uplift documented by fringing reefs and beach rocks that young {{from the top of the}} Table Limestone (180 m) towards the present coastline. Strontium isotope ratios from two different fringing reefs (0. 707172 and 0. 709145) and from a beach rock (0. 709163) allow tentative dating, (125 ky, ~ 400 ky, 945 ky) and indicate an uplift rate of about 5 cm/ky for this time period of La Désirade Island.

40|$|A {{sequence}} stratigraphic {{study was}} conducted on the Mendi and Darai Limestone Megasequences in the foreland area of the Papuan Basin in Papuan New Guinea. It involved the integrated use of seismic, wireline log, well core and cuttings, <b>strontium</b> isotope <b>age</b> and biostratigraphic data. This study enhanced the understanding of the structure, stratigraphy and depositional architecture of the limestones, and the morphology of the basin at the time of deposition. The results of the study were integrated with published geological and tectonic models for the Papuan Basin to develop a consistent and coherent model for the depositional history of the limestones. Eleven third-order sequences were delineated within the Mendi and Darai Limestone Megasequences. Eight depositional facies were interpreted across these sequences, namely deep-shelf, shallow-shelf, backreef, reef, shoal, forereef, basin margin and submarine fan facies. Each facies was differentiated according to seismic character and geometry, well core and cuttings descriptions, and its position in the depositional framework of the sequence. Deposition of the Mendi Limestone Megasequence commenced in the Eocene in response to thermal subsidence and eustatic sea-level rise. Sedimentation comprised open-marine, shallow-water, shelfal carbonates. During the middle of the Oligocene, the carbonate shelf was exposed and eroded in response to the collision of the Australian and Pacific Plates, or a major global eustatic sea-level fall. Sedimentation recommenced in the Late Oligocene, however, in response to renewed extensional faulting and subsidence associated with back-arc extension. This marked the onset of deposition of the Darai Limestone Megasequence in the study area. The KFZ, OFZ and Darai Fault were reactivated during this time, resulting in the oblique opening of the Omati Trough. Sedimentation was initially restricted to the Omati Trough and comprised deep and shallow-marine shelfal carbonates. By the Early Miocene, however, movement on the faults had ceased and an extensive carbonate platform had developed across the Gulf of Papua. Carbonate reef growth commenced along topographic highs associated with the KFZ, and led to the establishment of a rimmed carbonate shelf margin. Shallow to locally deeper-marine, shelfal carbonates were deposited on this shelf, and forereef, submarine fan and basin margin carbonates were deposited basinward of the shelf margin. The Uramu High and parts of the Pasca High became submerged during this time and provided sites for pinnacle reef development. During the middle of the Early Miocene, a major global eustatic sea-level fall or flexure of the Papuan Basin associated with Early Miocene ophiolite obduction subaerially exposed the carbonate shelf. This resulted in submarine erosion of the forereef and basin margin sediments. Towards the end of the Early Miocene, however, sedimentation recommenced. Shallow-marine, undifferentiated wackestones and packstones were deposited on the shelf; forereef, submarine fan and basin margin sediments were deposited basinward of the shelf margin; and reef growth recommenced along the shelf margin and on the Pasca and Uramu Highs. By the end of the Early Miocene, however, the pinnacle reef on the Pasca High had drowned. During the middle of the Middle Miocene, subtle inversion associated with ophiolite obduction subaerially exposed the carbonate shelf, and resulted in submarine erosion of the forereef and basin margin sediments. Sedimentation recommenced {{towards the end of the}} Middle Miocene, however, in response to eustatic sea-level rise and flexure of the crust associated with foreland basin development. Shallow marine, undifferentiated wackestones, packstones and grainstones were deposited on the shelf; carbonate shoals were deposited along the shelf margin; and forereef, submarine fan and basin margin carbonates were deposited basinward of the shelf margin. Carbonate production rapidly outpaced accommodation space on the shelf during this time, resulting in highstand shedding and the development of a large prograding submarine fan complex basinward of the shelf margin. By the Late Miocene, carbonate deposition had ceased across the majority of the study area in response to a major global eustatic sea-level fall or inversion associated with terrain accreation events along the northern Papuan margin. Minor carbonate deposition continued on parts of the Uramu High, however, until the middle of the Late Miocene. During the latest Miocene, clastic sediments prograded across the carbonate shelf, infilling parts of the foreland basin. Plio-Pleistocene compression resulted in inversion and erosion of the sedimentary package in the northwestern part of the study area. In the southeastern part of the Papuan Basin, however, clastic sedimentation continued to the present day...|$|R
