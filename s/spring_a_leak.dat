This squadron originally included four galleons, three pataches and two galleys.

60|$|From {{the first}} {{there had been}} a {{different}} feel about the ship, and as the big winds and waves began to strain her she commenced leaking. Soon she was leaking--not at any particular point, but everywhere. She did not <b>spring</b> <b>a</b> <b>leak,</b> I mean, but water came in first of all near the decaying edges of her planks, and then through them.|$|E

60|$|But after all, Little Jule {{was not to}} be confided in. Lively enough, {{and playful}} she was, but on that very account the more to be distrusted. Who knew, but that like some vivacious old mortal all at once sinking into a decline, she might, some dark night, <b>spring</b> <b>a</b> <b>leak</b> and carry us all to the bottom. However, she played us no such ugly trick, and therefore, I wrong Little Jule in supposing it.|$|E
60|$|The {{greater part}} of my uncle's last hours were spent in the {{discharge}} of the religious duties of his church, {{in which he was}} directed by the chaplain of the Sardinian ambassador, for whom, with some difficulty, we obtained permission to visit him. I could not ascertain by my own observation, or through the medical attendants, that Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone died of any formed complaint bearing a name in the science of medicine. He seemed to me completely worn out and broken down by fatigue of body and distress of mind, and rather ceased to exist, than died of any positive struggle,--just as a vessel, buffeted and tossed by a succession of tempestuous gales, her timbers overstrained, and her joints loosened, will sometimes <b>spring</b> <b>a</b> <b>leak</b> and founder, when there are no apparent causes for her destruction.|$|E
6000|$|This was a {{law from}} which Gabriel Nash was {{condemned}} to suffer, if suffering could on any occasion be predicated of Gabriel Nash. His pretension was in truth that he had purged his life of such possibilities of waste, though probably he would have admitted that if that fair vessel should <b>spring</b> <b>a</b> <b>leak</b> the wound in its side would have been dealt by a woman's hand. In dining two evenings before with her brother and with the Dormers Mrs. Dallow had been moved to exclaim that Peter and Nick knew the most extraordinary people. As regards Peter the attitudinising girl and her mother now pointed that moral with sufficient vividness; {{so that there was}} little arrogance in taking a similar quality for granted of the conceited man at her elbow, who sat there as if he might be capable from one moment to another of leaning over the arm of her sofa. She had not the slightest wish to talk with him about himself, and was afraid for an instant that he was on the point of passing from the chapter of his cleverness to that of his timidity. It was a false alarm, however, for he only animadverted on the pleasures of the elegant extract hurled--literally hurlé in general--from the centre of the room at one's defenceless head. He intimated that in his opinion these pleasures were all for the performers. The auditors had at any rate given Miss Rooth a charming afternoon; that of course was what Mrs. Dallow's kind brother had mainly intended in arranging the little party. (Julia hated to hear him call her brother [...] "kind": the term seemed offensively patronising.) But he himself, he related, was now constantly employed in the same beneficence, listening two-thirds of his time to [...] "intonations" [...] and shrieks. She had doubtless observed it herself, how the great current of the age, the adoration of the mime, was almost too strong for any individual; how it swept one along and dashed one against the rocks. As she made no response to this proposition Gabriel Nash asked her if she hadn't been struck with the main sign of the time, the preponderance of the mountebank, the glory and renown, the personal favour, he enjoyed. Hadn't she noticed what an immense part of the public attention he held in London at least? For in Paris society was not so pervaded with him, and the women of the profession, in particular, were not in every drawing-room.|$|E

6000|$|Eleven P.M.--In {{the boat}} [...] "City of Boston," [...] escorted thither by my car acquaintance, and {{deposited}} in the cabin. Trying {{to look as if}} the greater portion of my life had been passed on board boats, but painfully conscious that I don't know the first thing; so sit bolt upright, and stare about me till I hear one lady say to another--"We must secure our berths at once;" [...] whereupon I dart at one, and, while leisurely taking off my cloak, wait to discover what the second move may be. Several ladies draw the curtains that hang in a semi-circle before each nest--instantly I whisk mine smartly together, and then peep out to see what next. Gradually, on hooks above the blue and yellow drapery, appear the coats and bonnets of my neighbors, while their boots and shoes, in every imaginable attitude, assert themselves below, as if their owners had committed suicide in a body. A violent creaking, scrambling, and fussing, causes the fact that people are going regularly to bed to dawn upon my mind. Of course they are; and so am I--but pause at the seventh pin, remembering that, as I was born to be drowned, an eligible opportunity now presents itself; and, having twice escaped a watery grave, the third immersion will certainly extinguish my vital spark. The boat is new, but if it ever intends to blow up, <b>spring</b> <b>a</b> <b>leak,</b> catch afire, or be run into, it will do the deed to-night, because I'm here to fulfill my destiny. With tragic calmness I resign myself, replace my pins, lash my purse and papers together, with my handkerchief, examine the saving circumference of my hoop, and look about me for any means of deliverance when the moist moment shall arrive; for I've no intention of folding my hands and bubbling to death without an energetic splashing first. Barrels, hen-coops, portable settees, and life-preservers do not adorn the cabin, as they should; and, roving wildly to and fro, my eye sees no ray of hope till it falls upon a plump old lady, devoutly reading in the cabin Bible, and a voluminous night-cap. I remember that, at the swimming school, fat girls always floated best, and in an instant my plan is laid. At the first alarm I firmly attach myself to the plump lady, and cling to her through fire and water; for I feel that my old enemy, the cramp, will seize me by the foot, if I attempt to swim; and, though I can hardly expect to reach Jersey City with myself and my baggage in as good condition as I hoped, I might manage to get picked up by holding to my fat friend; if not it will be a comfort to feel that I've made an effort and shall die in good society. Poor dear woman! how little she dreamed, as she read and rocked, with her cap in a high state of starch, and her feet comfortably cooking at the register, what fell designs were hovering about her, and how intently a small but determined eye watched her, till it suddenly closed.|$|E

50|$|Like many schooners of the time, the Spangler {{endured a}} series of {{shipping}} incidents. In May 1856 she tore a hole in her bottom on a reef in Lake Huron.

The ship was dismasted in 1858, and later that same year collided with another schooner in the Straits of Mackinac. In 1859, the Spangler sailed into the Atlantic Ocean with a load of lumber, and returned the following spring.|$|E

5000|$|Genevieve, also {{referred}} to as [...] "Gin" [...] and [...] "Jenny" [...] at various points by Charlie and Vincie in [...] "Thar Sáile". She sells insurance (in reality, life assurance) and encounters the brothers on Tory Island after they wash ashore at her hotel. Her attempts to seduce Vincie are undone when Charlie knocks on her room window, claiming that he cannot find a room for himself and their drunken father (a corpse they possess). Genevieve is desperate to reach Sligo by 14:00 the following day to attend a meeting but, despite receiving assurance from the ferry captain that he leaves at 10:00, he sets sail early, leaving her no option but to row there on Charlie and Vincie's boat. A frustrated stamp of her stiletto causes the boat to <b>spring</b> <b>a</b> <b>leak.</b>|$|E
50|$|While Teddy is sleeping, Cotter {{comes to}} visit, {{but when he}} takes Teddy's hand, Nicole asks him to leave. Nicole then confronts Teddy about exactly who Cotter is. Teddy admits he used {{to think he was}} gay, but got help and insists he is {{straight}} now. At that moment, Teddy starts to have a severe headache. This leads House to think infection. Taub suggests cerebral infection, which would explain the headaches and cause POTS. It could also spread to the heart if it's fungal. House orders a spinal tap and says to run the CSF. But Teddy tests negative for infections and his headaches get worse. House thinks the spinal tap caused Teddy to <b>spring</b> <b>a</b> <b>leak,</b> worsening the headaches. Low pressure in the brain caused the POTS, not the other way around. However, Teddy's face twists in a strange way. It's not POTS.|$|E
