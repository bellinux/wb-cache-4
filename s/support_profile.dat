The differences among the profiles, in terms of satisfaction with supervision, experienced burnout, time to candidacy and disciplinary background were also examined. Background: 	This study explores social <b>support</b> <b>profiles</b> and their association with the experienced burnout, satisfaction with supervision, drop-out intentions, disciplinary background, and form of dissertation among doctoral students by employing a person-oriented approach. Methodology: In total, 402 doctoral students from a Finnish university completed a Doctoral Experience survey. Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) was used to group doctoral students according to social support from supervisors and the researcher community. Contribution: The present study is among the first quantitative studies to explore doctoral student social <b>support</b> <b>profiles</b> and their association with burnout, drop-out intentions, and time to candidacy. It brings into focus the importance of supervisory and researcher community support as one of the most crucial assets of doctoral education in researcher communities. Findings: Two social <b>support</b> <b>profiles,</b> a) sufficient <b>support</b> from supervisor and researched community, and b) insufficient support from both of these, were identified. Further investigation suggested that the doctoral students who received sufficient support were less likely to suffer from burnout and were less likely to develop drop-out intentions than students who received insufficient support from their supervisor and the researcher community. Recommendations for Practitioners: A recommendation deriving from this research is to identify students at risk as early as possible and assist them with sufficient support...|$|R

40|$|Emplacement {{of a large}} igneous {{province}} {{is usually}} accompanied by kilometre-scale uplift over an area of V 106 km 2. We have developed a method for mapping the dynamically supported swell associated with the North Atlantic Igneous Province by inverting palaeo-topographic information from continental margins. In the forward model, latest Palaeocene palaeo-topography around Britain and Ireland is calculated by correcting present-day topography for global sea-level change, denudation and dynamic support. We initially assume a Gaussian, axially symmetric dynamic <b>support</b> <b>profile.</b> Modelled coastlines are compared with palaeo-coastlines mapped on 2 D and 3 D reflection seismic data. In the inverse model, the amplitude, width and centre of the dynamically supported swell are determined by minimising misfit between modelled and observed coastlines. Uncertainties associated with global sea-level variation and denudation have little effect on this calculation. The best-fit dynamic <b>support</b> <b>profile</b> from inverting palaeo-coastline positions is in good agreement with dynamic support estimates from subsidence anomalies measured in extensional sedimentary basins fringing Britain and Ireland. However, a circular planform of dynamic support cannot simultaneously account for palaeo-coastlines, subsidence anomalies and the spatial extent of the North Atlantic Igneous Province. In combination, {{these data suggest that}} the swell was more irregular in planform. This inference can be tested in future by modelling stratigraphic data from offshore Norway, Greenland and Canada. The large area...|$|E

Behavioral, physiological, and/or psychological changes are common manifestations of social isolation. Increased morbidity and mortality are the outcome. Ecological systems theory and social baseline theory provided the framework to explore 10 older individuals 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of risk for social isolation and their perceived barriers to social integration. Data for this interpretive phenomenological study were collected from participant diaries, interviews, the 6 -item de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGLS- 6), the Lubben Social Network Scale 6 (LSNS- 6), a demographic survey, and a social <b>support</b> <b>profile.</b> The Colaizzi method and interpretive phenomenological analysis were used to analyze diaries and interviews. Participant demographics, DJGLS- 6, LSNS- 6, and social <b>support</b> <b>profile</b> data were used to enrich descriptions of the participants and find other themes. Results indicated that most participants like living alone. However, more than half reported periods of loneliness and 4 reported estrangement from an offspring. Experiences of negative age-related treatment were described by many participants and most reported that transportation and mobility issues were the biggest barriers to social integration. Additionally, many participants reported that access to planned social activities would alleviate social isolation. Implications for positive social change arise from this research {{in the form of}} increased awareness of the experiences and perceptions of older individuals at risk for social isolation.

40|$|After 2002, {{the year}} of the third MMP {{election}} in New Zealand, this paper asks whether we may be through the process of electoral system transition and may now simply treat the various electoral outcomes as ‘normal ’ responses to the economic and political events of the government’s term of office.

40|$|Copyright © 2006 Australiasian Society for the Study of Intellectual Disability Inc. Background: The Service Need Assessment Profile (SNAP) {{measures}} individual functional {{needs in}} areas of daily living. It produces a <b>support</b> <b>profile,</b> detailing the time allocations for staff support to assist in each area of need. The Supports Intensity Scale (SIS) is a support needs assessment scale designed to provide an objective measure of a person's need for support in medical, behavioural, and life activities. SIS {{can be used for}} individualised support planning, clinical judgements regarding support needs, resource allocation and financial planning. The Inventory for Client and Agency Planning (ICAP) assesses adaptive and maladaptive behaviours and gathers additional information to determine type and amount of special assistance that people with disabilities need. Method: This study evaluated the construct and criterion validities of SNAP in relation to the SIS and ICAP, using assessment data from 114 individuals with a range of disabilities and levels of severity. Results: Construct and criterion validities were supported for the SNAP by high correlations with SIS, ICAP, and staff estimates of support needs and by its capacity to discriminate between sub-groups in expected ways.

40|$|Universal {{security}} over {{a network}} with linear network coding has been intensively studied. However, previous linear codes {{used for this}} purpose were linear over a larger field than that used on the network. In this work, we introduce new parameters (relative dimension/rank <b>support</b> <b>profile</b> and relative generalized matrix weights) for linear codes that are linear over the field used in the network, measuring the universal security performance of these codes. The proposed new parameters enable us to use optimally universal secure linear codes on noiseless networks for all possible parameters, as opposed to previous works, and also enable us to add universal security to the recently proposed list-decodable rank-metric codes by Guruswami et al. We give several properties of the new parameters: monotonicity, Singleton-type lower and upper bounds, a duality theorem, and definitions and characterizations of equivalences of linear codes. Finally, we show that our parameters strictly extend relative dimension/length profile and relative generalized Hamming weights, respectively, and relative dimension/intersection profile and relative generalized rank weights, respectively. Moreover, we show that generalized matrix weights are larger than Delsarte generalized weights.

40|$|Providing {{appropriate}} {{support for}} people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) is challenging, since valid and reliable instruments {{that can be used}} for assessment in persons with PIMD are scarce. Therefore, this study analyzes the usability and validity of an instrument developed for persons with PIMD, the Inventory of the personal Profile and Support (IPS). This instrument is part of a person-centered, goal-oriented, interdisciplinary intervention for persons with PIMD, which is called the “support program. ” A first step in the support program is to draw up a personal profile, on which a long term goal for the person with PIMD can be based. When the IPS is used in combination with another instrument, the Behavior Assessment Scales (BAS), a <b>support</b> <b>profile</b> can be written. However, the IPS has not been studied on psychometric qualities yet. To look into the usability and content validity of the IPS, two questionnaires that were developed for this study were used for eight direct support persons of three care facilities. Although filling in the IPS is time-consuming and is therefore sometimes considered to be a burden, in general usability and content validity were rated as good. This study underlines the importance of using assessment instruments during different stages of support in a consistent, systematic way, using the input of all involved persons in support of the person with PIMD...|$|E

It first compares <b>support</b> for counterterrorism <b>profiling</b> with <b>support</b> for <b>profiling</b> Black motorists. Then, it investigates whether {{the status of}} the profilee as a U. S. citizen of Arab or Middle Eastern appearance or as an immigrant alters either sup-port for profiling or the determinants of that support. In both sets of analyses, the study investigates how competing ideas about the meaning of American identity shape opin-ions about profiling. Particular attention is paid to liberalism’s emphasis on the rights of citizenship and ethnoculturalism’s emphasis on the ascriptive boundaries of American identity. The results show that <b>support</b> for counterterrorism <b>profiling</b> is higher than <b>support</b> for <b>profiling</b> Black motorists, that people are more supportive of profiling immigrants than they are of profiling U.

40|$|ObjectivesSurgical {{ventricular}} reconstruction {{has been}} {{believed to be}} beneficial for those with ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, the effectiveness of surgical ventricular reconstruction was not proved by a large-scale trial, and no report has clearly demonstrated the exact indications and limitations of surgical ventricular reconstruction. The {{purpose of this study}} was to elucidate predictive factors of mortality after surgical ventricular reconstruction and to develop a prognostic model by calculating risk scores. MethodsThe study subjects were 596 patients who underwent surgical ventricular reconstruction for chronic ischemic heart failure in 11 Japanese cardiovascular hospitals between 2000 and 2010. Potential predictors of postoperative mortality were assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model, and a risk score was calculated. ResultsForty-one patients died before discharge, and 81 patients died during a mean follow-up time of 2. 9 years. Four independent predictors of mortality were identified: age, Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory <b>Support</b> <b>profile,</b> left ventricular ejection fraction, and severity of mitral regurgitation. Each variable was assigned a number of points proportional to its regression coefficient. A risk score was calculated using the point scores for each patient, and 3 risk groups were developed: a low-risk group (0 - 4 points), an intermediate-risk group (5 - 6 points), and a high-risk group (7 - 12 points). Their 3 -year survivals were 93 %, 81 %, and 44 %, respectively (log-rank P < . 001). Harrell’s C-index of the predictive model was 0. 69.

Observations of the domains of Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support were conducted in 49 Finnish kindergarten classrooms utilizing the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (R. C. Pianta, K. M. LaParo, & B. K. Hamre, 2008). In addition, questionnaire data on classroom and teacher characteristics, as well as Early Childhood Classroom Observation Measure (D. Stipek & P.
