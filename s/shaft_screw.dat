The test group was submitted to the modified TTA technique, stabilized by one <b>shaft</b> <b>screw</b> in craniocaudal position and a titanium cage inserted at the osteotomy site. The position of the patellar tendon, 90 ° in relation to the tibial plateau, and the correct position of all implants were confirmed radiographically after surgery. Posteriorly, in both groups, limbs were harvested and tibias collected with their respectively patellar tendon insertion preserved for the mechanical resistance test. The fixation of the tibial tuberosity with a <b>shaft</b> <b>screw</b> and titanium cage resulted in resistance compatible with the normal physiological forces transferred to the hind-limbs during locomotion.

40|$|Abstract: The air in {{vertical}} {{screw conveyor}} creates flows such as Taylor-Couette-Poiseuille flow and turbulent flow {{with the increase of}} rotational speed of screw shaft. The stable helical vortex in TCP flow is beneficial to improve the transporting efficiency of granular materials. This paper described the N-S equations of incompressible steady flow (air) in {{vertical screw conveyor}} and deduced the distribution solution of velocity of stable helical vortex in TCP. And this paper also analyzed the relationship between the Reynolds number Re and parameters such as rotational speed of screw shaft, shaft diameter of screw <b>shaft,</b> <b>screw</b> pitch. Then this paper simulated different flows using FLUENT software and obtains the velocity vector chart and streamline chart with different rotational speed of screw shaft in vertical screw conveyor. The effect of simulation verified the correctness of theoretical analysis and recommended the critical Reynolds number Rec suitable for appearance of stable helical vortex in TCP flow in the conveyor.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{determine}} biomechanical alterations resultant from a modification in the fixation method of the tibial tuberosity advancement technique (TTA), originally described for stabilization of the cranial cruciate-deficient stifle. Ten adult mongrel dogs weighing 25 - 30 kg were used. After euthanasia, performed for reasons unrelated to this study, the hind limbs were distributed into two groups: G 1 operated (n= 10) and G 2 control (n= 10), {{represented by the}} contralateral limb. The operated hind limbs were orthopedically, goniometrically and radiographically evaluated, sequentially at four moments: moment 1, in intact joints; moment 2, after cranial cruciate desmotomy; moment 3, after surgical stabilization of the stifle joint using modified TTA; and moment 4, after caudal cruciate ligament desmotomy. The tibial tuberosity was stabilized by one <b>shaft</b> <b>screw</b> craniocaudally and a titanium cage inserted at the osteotomy site.

40|$|At the University of Pretoria's Fluoropolymer Laboratory, an {{important}} long-term {{project is the}} development of a waste polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) depolymerisation process where TFE can be produced, purified and polymerised to reproduce pure PTFE. At the start of this project, the process consisted of a batch depolymerisation system, a sub-zero distillation column, and a polymerisation reactor system. The batch depolymerisation system could not produce enough gas per session to operate the downstream processes efficiently. The main aim of this investigation was to adapt the batch depolymerisation system to enable continuous depolymerisation by designing, implementing and testing a continuous PTFE screw feeder. With the screw feeder in place, the operating limits, with regard to temperature, pressure, and Teflon® PTFE 807 N feed rate, were determined. The effects of temperature and pressure on the tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), hexafluoropropylene (HFP) and octafluorocyclobutane (OFCB) fractional composition were examined and the optimum operating conditions to maximise these products were determined statistically. An investigative approach was used in designing the hopper system. The optimum hopper wall angle and Teflon® PTFE 807 N feed mixture was determined experimentally by testing four hopper angles, pure Teflon® PTFE 807 N, and two Teflon® PTFE 807 N mixtures (Teflon® PTFE 807 N mixed with larger, compressed Teflon® PTFE 807 N, particles in a 70 : 30 wt % and 50 : 50 wt % ratio) and two motor speeds. At all of the hopper angles and Teflon mixture configurations, rat-hole formation prevented the feeder from producing a constant flow rate. A hopper wall angle of 20 ° (to the vertical) together with plain Teflon® PTFE 807 N were selected, as these two variables together helped to delay the formation of rat-holes the most. A stirrer was inserted in the hopper to negate the rat-holing problem. The continuous feeder was successfully designed, manufactured, calibrated, and installed. The feeder consists of a wedge-shaped hopper with a constant pitch, a tapered <b>shaft</b> <b>screw</b> and is capable of providing a maximum Teflon® PTFE 807 N flow rate of approximately 20 g·min- 1 for up to 40 min. Experimental test runs of the continuous depolymerisation system indicated that the minimum operating reactor temperature was 650 °C due to heat transfer and or rate of reaction limitations. The maximum flow rate of Teflon® PTFE 807 N was determined to be 11 g·min- 1 for the current reactor system. The maximum operating temperature and pressure were limited to 750 °C and 40 kPa, respectively, to avoid operating conditions that could lead to the increased production of PFIB. A three-level full factorial experimental design was used to determine the temperature and pressure effects on the fractional distribution of TFE, HFP, and OFCB under steady operating conditions. For pressure control purposed no carrier gas was used. The PTFE flow rate and experimental run time were kept constant at 11 g·min- 1 and 15 min, respectively. The pressure in the system was regulated manually by constricting the flow of product gas out of the system. A maximum TFE mole percentage of 97 % was achieved at operating conditions of 650 °C and 2 kPa. The maximum HFP mole percentage (31 %) was observed at operating conditions of 750 °C and 20 kPa. A maximum of 55 % was observed at 750 °C and 40 kPa for OFCB. Statistical analysis of the continuous depolymerisation results indicate that TFE formation is highly sensitive to changes in pressure, with higher TFE yield fractions achieved at low pressures. The production of OFCB is highly sensitive to pressure, whereas the formation of HFP is equally affected by pressure and temperature changes. However, changes in pressure have a larger effect on the HFP production than temperature when operating at pressures lower than approximately 20 kPa. At higher pressures the sensitivity has the inverse affect, with temperature having a larger effect. As opposed to TFE, an increase in temperature and pressure leads to an increase in the HFP and OFCB concentration. To achieve a TFE mole percentages of 95 % and higher, the operating temperature of the system has to be kept in the range of 650 °C 720 °C, together with a system pressure of 2 kPa or less. Within the operating range of 730 °C 750 °C and 35 kPa 40 kPa a mole percentage of 50 % and higher can be expected for OFCB. A mole percentage of 19 % and higher can be expected for HFP in the operating range of 744 °C 750 °C and 32 kPa 40 kPa. It was determined through a kinetic analysis of the system, that the residence time of the product gas in the reactor has a large effect on the production of HFP, with an increase in residence time leading to a sharp increase in the HFP concentration and a decrease in the OFCB and TFE concentrations. Analysis of the determined product specific kinetics indicate that the predominant HFP production pathway at low residence times (&# 060 3 s) is via the reaction of TFE with difluorocarbenes. At higher residence times the dominant reaction pathway is the dissociation OFCB. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017. Chemical EngineeringMEngUnrestricte...|$|E

40|$|Objective— To compare acute {{fixation}} {{stability and}} insertion effort of cortex bone screws {{with and without}} a shaft inserted in lag fashion in equine metacarpal (metatarsal, MC(T) III) bone. Methods— Screw types with independent variables of screw diameter (4. 5 or 5. 5 mm) and shaft type (without shaft, with 20 -mm shaft, or with 25 -mm shaft) were studied. Bone specimens cut from distal equine MC(T) III condyles were used. After screw insertion in lag fashion into 2 bone blocks with an instrumented device, shear tests were conducted in a mechanical testing machine. Outcome variables of peak insertion torque, insertion energy, stiffness, yield strength, and displacement at 3 kN of load were compared. Results— The effects of screw design were substantial. <b>Screws</b> with <b>shaft</b> were 30 % to 40 % stiffer and 60 % to 70 % stronger than <b>screws</b> without <b>shaft.</b> <b>Screws</b> with <b>shaft</b> could tolerate 80 to 95 kg more force than <b>screws</b> without <b>shaft</b> before yielding. At 3 kN load, the displacement with <b>screws</b> with <b>shaft</b> was 55 % to 60 % of that with <b>screws</b> without <b>shaft.</b> <b>Screws</b> with a long shaft tended to perform better than those with a short shaft. There {{was no difference in}} the shear stiffness, shear yield strength, or shear displacement between the 2 screw diameters. Although larger diameter screws required more insertion effort, and screws with a short shaft required the most insertion energy, these differences were small. Conclusions— Cortex screws with a long shaft of 4. 5 - or 5. 5 -mm diameter provide better stability in equine MC(T) III condyle bone with less insertion effort compared with those with a short shaft or no shaft.

5000|$|A screw is a {{mechanism}} that converts rotational motion to linear motion, and a torque (rotational force) to a linear force. [...] It {{is one of}} the six classical simple machines.
