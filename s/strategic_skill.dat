On philosophical ground, he struggled with unwavering hope against Naturalism and Liberalism, which he considered a fatal impediment to the constitution of an unreservedly Christian society. He helped, in a measure, to prepare men's minds for the definition of the papal infallibility, a dogma which reversed the struggle against papal authority fought a century previously by many Gallican and Josephite bishops.|$|E
5000|$|His kingdom {{consisted}} probably of Egypt only, {{as far as}} the First Cataract, but to this {{he added}} Cyprus, and his influence was great in Cyrene. In his fourth year ( [...] BCE), Amasis was able to defeat an invasion of Egypt by the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar II; henceforth, the Babylonians experienced sufficient difficulties controlling their empire that they were forced to abandon future attacks against Amasis. However, Amasis was later faced with a more formidable enemy with the rise of Persia under Cyrus who ascended to the throne in 559 BCE; his final years were preoccupied by the threat of the impending Persian onslaught against Egypt. With great <b>strategic</b> <b>skill,</b> Cyrus had destroyed Lydia in 546 BCE and finally defeated the Babylonians in 538 BCE which left Amasis with no major Near Eastern allies to counter Persia's increasing military might. Amasis reacted by cultivating closer ties with the Greek states to counter the future Persian invasion into Egypt but was fortunate to have died in 526 BCE shortly before the Persians attacked. The final assault instead fell upon his son Psamtik III, whom the Persians defeated in 525 BCE after a reign of only six months.|$|E

40|$|Holistic and {{analytic}} cognitive {{strategies are}} considered in three experiments regarding <b>strategic</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition of visual discrimination of computer displayed graphics. Experiment 1 tests whether individuals use similar cognitive styles across different visual judgment tasks. Experiment 2 tests {{the interaction of}} the holistic and analytic style with varying levels of training difficulty on transfer performance in a novel task. Experiment 3 measures this holistic and analytic interaction with level of training difficulty using a realistic form of configural displays called radar graphs. Results show that individuals use cognitive styles that are applied consistently across similar tasks. Individuals also develop strategic cognitive processing skills differently depending on cognitive style. It is suggested that analytic participants acquire more effective skills during training than holistic participants, and are not affected by the difficulty of training when transferring to novel stimuli. Holistic participants are affected by the difficulty of training, and initially perform more accurately in transfer to novel stimuli if trained using hard comparisons. Easy trained holistic participants are more flexible in their strategies longitudinally than analytic participants are, however. Holistic participants 2 ̆ 7 strategies are malleable even after training. This leads to design implications not only for training strategies, but also for computer interface design. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} research that has recently been conducted on the northern Australian rangelands. The research has focussed on conceptualising and measuring the current capacity of cattle producers to adopt new strategies so as to better adapt to the impacts of climate change. The capacity to adapt is defined as comprising four essential elements: (i) managing risk and uncertainty, (ii) possessing <b>strategic</b> <b>skill</b> sets such as planning, experimenting, refining and learning, (iii) psychological and financial buffers, and (iv) an interest in change. However, {{there appears to be}} a lack of sufficient capacity currently existing within the industry to meet the challenges of the future: only 16 % of producers are regarded to be sufficiently adaptive. Research also highlights that adaptive capacity can be enhanced, and here we highlight those factors that are known to influence adaptive capacity either positively or negatively. Producers with strong networks and trust in informal and formal connections, a strong locus of control, larger properties, a focus on profitability, and use technology, are more likely to persist within the industry through time. We propose that investing in the capacity of producers to better cope and adapt to change is a most logical approach to ensuring both the sustainability of the industry and of the rangelands. A range of strategies are proposed that may enhance adaptive capacity...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Three main {{goals were}} {{addressed}} in this research. First, we tested the claims of two cognitive mechanisms that have been proposed to explain expert performance. This was done during assessment and intervention phases of decision making. Second, we tested the validity of an online test of perceptual-cognitive skill in soccer: The Online Assessment of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Skill</b> In Soccer (OASSIS). Third, we compared the OASSIS to other predictors of skill in soccer. Design: Over {{the course of a}} three-part experiment, participants completed an updated version of the option-generation paradigm employed by Ward, Ericsson, and Williams (2013), the OASSIS, and a battery of other cognitive tests. Performance on these tests was used to inform theory and validate the OASSIS as an applied tool for domain professionals. Method: NCAA Division 1 and recreational-level soccer players completed a battery of tests, both using paper/pencil (see Ward et al., 2013) and online. Results: Support for Long Term Working Memory theory (LTWM; see Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995) was observed during both phases of decision making, though the prescriptions of the Take-The-First heuristic (see Johnson & Raab, 2003) tend to hold, particularly within intervention phase. When used to predict skill-group membership, the OASSIS accounted for more variance than other domain-general tests of cognition. Furthermore, scores on the OASSIS correlated with other measures of perceptual-cognitive skill in soccer and the process-level predictions made by LTWM. Conclusions: Updates to our theoretical understanding of expert performance are provided and the validity of the OASSIS is demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Measures of domain-specific memory {{have been}} shown to be {{correlated}} with anticipation skill in sport (North et al., 2011). However, the cognitive processes supporting recognition appear to be simpler than those supporting anticipation (North et al., 2011) and may be underpinned by general cognitive abilities, especially in low-skilled performers (Ackerman, 1988). In this paper we hypothesized that domain-general ability would predict domain-specific recognition skill in soccer in a low-skilled sample but that anticipation skill would explain additional unique variance. Methods 58 recreational-level soccer players completed two domain-general tests (i. e., Mental Rotations Test [MRT-A], Peters, et al., 1995; Berlin Numeracy Test [BNT], Cokely et al., 2012), a test of anticipation skill (Online Assessment of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Skill</b> In Soccer [OASSIS], Belling, Suss, & Ward, 2014), and a soccer recognition test. Results The MRT-A (β =. 42, p <. 01) and BNT (β =. 06, p =. 67) predicted recognition skill (R 2 =. 20, F = 6. 72, p <. 01). However, the OASSIS did not explain more variance (R 2 change =. 01, F =. 78, p =. 38). Discussion Only spatial ability significantly predicted recognition performance suggesting that domain-general abilities may be more relevant than anticipation skill at this level. The data partially support Ackerman’s (1988) model—domain-general ability predicted performance but a more central measure of general cognitive ability (i. e., BNT) did not, despite the complexity of the recognition task. Further research should explore the benefit of recognition versus anticipation training for improving perceptual skill...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} profitably manage {{the level of}} {{resources}} in a service system {{can be considered a}} <b>strategic</b> <b>skill</b> in all those organizations, including no-profit ones and Public Administrations, that aim at providing an added value service to customers as well as balancing the level of service (in terms of quality) with costs. In this paper we will focus on a typical service system inside of which, in every moment, management struggles in order to reach that balance, because of the extremely dynamic behavior of the entire system: a Call Center. Our aim is to show that an efficient management of the customers abandonment and the quality of service offered to customers, can positively impact on a correct resource leveling in the system, which may otherwise be found by means of typical Operations Research or Queuing Theory methods. In particular, we want to show that this can be more easily inferred and understood by resorting to simulation. After introducing some preliminary aspects by means of Queuing Theory (Erlang’s formula), we’ll first study the problem of customer abandonment (balking and reneging) by simulating a Call Center simple model by means of a process-oriented discrete-time simulation tool (Arena), and then explore a more complex model taking into account customer satisfaction an the quality of the service offered approaching the modelling process of the system by means of System Dynamics. Results show that the level of resources can be further reduced, and that the customer (often thought as an entity external to the system) plays instead an important role on the performance of the whole system, both operationally and economicall...|$|E
40|$|Neuroeconomics uses {{knowledge}} about brain mechanisms to inform economic analysis, and roots economics in biology. It {{opens up the}} "black box" of the brain, much as organizational economics adds detail {{to the theory of}} the firm. Neuroscientists use many tools— including brain imaging, behavior of patients with localized brain lesions, animal behavior, and recording single neuron activity. The key insight for economics is that the brain is composed of multiple systems which interact. Controlled systems ("executive function") interrupt automatic ones. Emotions and cognition both guide decisions. Just as prices and allocations emerge from the interaction of two processes—supply and demand— individual decisions can be modeled as the result of two (or more) processes interacting. Indeed, "dual-process" models of this sort are better rooted in neuroscientific fact, and more empirically accurate, than single-process models (such as utility-maximization). We discuss how brain evidence complicates standard assumptions about basic preference, to include homeostasis and other kinds of state-dependence. We also discuss applications to intertemporal choice, risk and decision making, and game theory. Intertemporal choice appears to be domain-specific and heavily influenced by emotion. The simplified ß-d of quasi-hyperbolic discounting is supported by activation in distinct regions of limbic and cortical systems. In risky decision, imaging data tentatively support the idea that gains and losses are coded separately, and that ambiguity is distinct from risk, because it activates fear and discomfort regions. (Ironically, lesion patients who do not receive fear signals in prefrontal cortex are "rationally" neutral toward ambiguity.) Game theory studies show the effect of brain regions implicated in "theory of mind", correlates of <b>strategic</b> <b>skill,</b> and effects of hormones and other biological variables. Finally, economics can contribute to neuroscience because simple rational-choice models are useful for understanding highly-evolved behavior like motor actions that earn rewards, and Bayesian integration of sensorimotor information. ...|$|E
