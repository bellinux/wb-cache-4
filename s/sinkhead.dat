40|$|The {{performed}} {{investigations have}} resulted in conclusion that the vermicularizing treatment of ‘basic’ cast iron, consisting in‘conditioning’ the alloy by means of VLCe(2) master alloy, introducing the DENODUL 5 master alloy, and graphitizing with SRF 75 master alloy, provides for obtaining vermicular graphite precipitates {{in the structure of}} material cast within 15 minutes’ period from themodifying treatment. The cast iron has been melted in the induction crucible furnace of medium frequency under industrial conditions. Thealloy has been subjected to vermicularization in the slender ladle of 1 Mg capacity. Graphitizing has been performed in the course oftransferring the cast iron from the slender ladle to the pouring ladle. A series of test coupons in the form of reversed U-blocks of test part walls 25 mm thick have been cast of the produced cast iron. Then specimens both for metallographic examination and for testing themechanical properties have been taken from the coupons. The analysis of cast iron structure has revealed, among others, that howeverpurely vermicular graphite precipitates occurred in specimens taken out of the lower parts of test coupon walls (which are cooled faster),the nodular graphite precipitates in quantity up to 10 % could be observed in specimens from the upper parts of test coupon walls (located close beneath the <b>sinkhead)</b> ...|$|E

Disks of gas-turbine engine are high loaded parts of irregular shape having intensive stress concentrators wherein a 3 D stress strain state occurs. The loss of load-carrying capability or burst of disk {{can lead to}} severe accident or disaster. Therefore, development of methods to assess deformations and to predict burst {{is one of the}} most important problems. Strength assessment approaches are used at all levels of engine creation. In recent years due to actively developing numerical method, particularly FEA, it became possible to investigate load-carrying capability of irregular shape disks, to use 3 D computing schemes including flow theory and different options of force and deformation failure criteria. In spite of a wide progress and practical use of strength assessment approaches, there is a lack of detailed research data on yield surface of disk alloys. The main purpose of this work is to validate the use of basis hypothesis of flow theory and investigate the yield surface of disk alloys during the disks spin test. The results of quasi-static numerical simulation of spin tests of model disk made from high-temperature forged alloy are presented. To determine stress-strain state of disk during loading finite element analysis is used. Simulation of elastic-plastic strain fields was carried out using incremental theory of plasticity with isotropic hardening. Hardening function was taken from the results of specimens tensile test. Specimens were cut from a <b>sinkhead</b> of model disk. The paper investigates the model sensitivity affected by V. Mises and Tresca yield criteria as well as the Hosford model. To identify the material model parameters the eddy current sensors were used in the experimental approach to measure rim radial displacements during the load-unload of spin test. The results of calculation made using different material models were compared with the experimental results. A good agreement of numerical and experimental data has been shown in case of using V. Mises yield criteria. </p...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} hardness {{changes for}} cast iron with nodular and vermicular graphite, determined within the separately cast test blocks. Investigation has comprised cast irons with similar ferrite and pearlite fractions {{in the metal}} matrix. The hardness measurements have been performed by Brinell method for samples taken both from an edge and from the centre of a Y block (for nodular cast iron) or of a reversed U block (in the case of vermicular cast iron). Investigations have pertained both to the test parts and to the <b>sinkheads</b> of the test blocks. Hardness measurements have been completed with metallographic examination...|$|R
