40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the partial {{avoidance}} of contract and the limits to the following adjustment of its content. According to Art. 1419 of the Italian civil code, a contract can be partially void, but nothing has been expressly stated regarding the partial voidability. Nonetheless, the partial voidability is usually acknowledged by the courts, provided that the remaining part of the contract would not be further adapted or modified {{with respect to the}} price or other terms. As a consequence of this rule, when the grounds of avoidance affect the performance only in part, the party affected should have no right to a corresponding reduction of the price. This paper maintains that in some cases it could be unnecessarily harsh to deny the possibility of adapting the remaining contract after its partial annulment and it would rather be preferable to examine and take into account the different ways of adapting a contract provided for by the Italian law system, such as the judicial power of filling gaps, renegotiation, and the corresponding reduction of the price. For the same reasons, the partial avoidance of the contractual terms should be maintained separate from the partial avoidance of the object of performance: the former involves the juridical balance of the contract and requires a more in-depth analysis of the content, whereas the later is related to the economic balance of performance and counterperformance left to the contractual autonomy of the parties and requires only a corresponding reduction of the price. Consequently, in case of partial avoidance limited to the object of performance, the contract is subject to the rule set out by Art. 1464 of the Italian civil code, governing the <b>supervening</b> partial <b>impossibility,</b> which can be considered as the general rule when a performance has been partly reduced...|$|R
50|$|<b>Supervening</b> <b>impossibility</b> {{generally}} terminates the obligation, {{as well as}} any counter-obligation, {{from the}} point at which impossibility arose. Accrued rights are enforceable, but future obligations disappear. Where, however, there has been a guarantee of performance, this overrides the supervening impossibility—even acts of god.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Supervening</b> <b>impossibility</b> of {{performance}} takes place where {{an event that}} occurs (or supervenes) after the contract has commenced objectively renders the contract no longer performable [...] This event must have been unforeseen and unavoidable by a reasonable person, such that no-one in that position could have fulfilled the obligation.|$|E
5000|$|Generic {{goods and}} {{services}} {{are not subject to}} <b>supervening</b> <b>impossibility,</b> because they are easily obtainable and performance is still theoretically executable. An inability to meet one's debts is also precluded, because it entails fault. The impossibility must, in an objective sense, be outside of one's control. The following are classic examples: ...|$|E

50|$|World Leisure Holidays (Pty) Ltd v Georges is an {{important}} case in South African contract law, specifically {{in the area of}} termination. It was heard in the Witwatersrand Local Division by Cloete J, Blieden J and Malan J on 14 February, 2002, with judgment handed down on 26 February. An appeal from a decision in a magistrate's court, it is the leading case on the issue of temporary <b>supervening</b> <b>impossibility</b> of performance.|$|E
50|$|Parties cannot create {{contractual}} obligations that {{are impossible to}} perform. The impossibility of performance must be objective or absolute: that is, for all practical intents and purposes, nobody {{should be able to}} render the performance. In the case of initial impossibility, the contractual obligation is void; in the case of <b>supervening</b> <b>impossibility,</b> performance becomes impossible after conclusion of the contract. The obligation then terminates. Where a party makes performance impossible, however, the obligation does not terminate: Such a party commits breach of contract.|$|E
50|$|The {{consequences}} of mora debitoris are threefold. First, <b>supervening</b> <b>impossibility</b> of performance, {{which is not}} due to the fault of either party, does not terminate the contract, contrary to the normal rule, unless the debtor can show that, {{even if he had}} performed timeously, the same fate would have befallen the prestation {{in the hands of the}} creditor (perpetuatio obligationis). In the special case of the contract of sale, this rule has the effect that the risk of destruction passes back to the seller who is in mora.|$|E
5000|$|The usual {{remedies}} for breach {{are available to}} the debtor. If the creditor is in mora, the risk of damage to contractual goods, caused by <b>supervening</b> <b>impossibility</b> and the debtor's negligence (short of gross negligence), passes to the creditor. Clearly, the debtor is entitled to damages for any loss he has suffered {{as a result of}} the mora, like the cost of storing merchandise or feeding animals he had to deliver. He may cancel the contract in the same circumstances as those in which the creditor may cancel for mora debitoris where time: ...|$|E
50|$|If {{the debtor}} elects {{to abide by}} the contract, he may in {{suitable}} circumstances obtain an order compelling the creditor to co-operate. His own duty to perform then of course remains, but the delay on his side does not constitute mora debitoris, being occasioned by the fault of the creditor. The debtor’s duty of care in respect of the article to be delivered (where appropriate) is diminished. Once the creditor falls into mora, the debtor is liable only for dolus or culpa lata. Moreover, the principle of perpetuatio obligationis applies here in reverse: The creditor bears the risk of <b>supervening</b> <b>impossibility</b> of performance brought about fortuitously or by the debtor’s culpa (provided such negligence is not gross, culpa lata).|$|E
40|$|The South African law of {{contract}} contains a lacuna in that it addresses only the narrow issue of <b>supervening</b> <b>impossibility</b> and not the broader problem of supervening change of circumstances. Comparative study is illuminating in this regard: many other leading Western legal systems employ a doctrine of changed circumstances. One such example is English law. While this system is more conservative than, for example, the equivalent US law or the model rules of international trade as contained in the Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts, it offers a broad approach of discharge {{where there has been}} a “radical change in the obligation”. This feature of English law has been used in several past South African decisions to offer a solution to the lack of a doctrine to deal with changed circumstances in this country. The question needs to be asked what the status of these precedents is and in particular whether the English law of frustration is compatible with the South African common law. The answer is that there are fundamental differences between these two systems and that while English law provides a useful comparative study, in itself it is not the ideal solution to South Africa’s problem...|$|E
40|$|Section 23 of the Constitution {{provides}} {{that everyone has}} a right to fair labour practice. The constitutional right to fair labour practices includes the right not to be unfairly dismissed and is given effect to by section 185 of the LRA. The constitutional right not to be unfairly dismissed is given effect to by Chapter VIII of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 (the LRA), which provides a remedy for an unfair dismissal. Schedule 8 of the LRA contains a “Code of Good Practice: Dismissal”, which the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (the CCMA) and the Labour Courts must take into account when determining the fairness of a dismissal. The LRA expressly recognises three grounds for termination of the employment contract namely; misconduct {{on the part of the}} employee, incapacity due to an employee’s poor work performance, ill health or injury and termination due an employer’s operational requirements. In terms of the LRA, a dismissal must be procedurally and substantively fair. The requirements for procedural and substantive fairness are contained in Schedule 8 of the Code of Good Practice: Dismissal. The provisions of section 185 of the LRA apply to all employers and employees in both the public and the private sectors, with the exception of members of the National Defence Force, the National Intelligence Agency, the South African Secret Service and the South African National Academy of Intelligence. Section 213 of the LRA defines an “employee” as any person, excluding an independent contractor, who works for another person or for the State and who receives, or is entitled to receive, any remuneration and any person who in any manner assists in carrying out or conducting the business of an employer. Section 200 A of the LRA sets out the presumption as to who is an employee. This is a guideline to assist in determining who is an employee The Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 of 1997 (the BCEA) sets minimum terms and conditions of employment including the notice of termination of employment. Under the common law an employment contract of employment can be terminated on either the expiration of the agreed period of employment or on completion of the specified task in cases of fixed-term contracts. Also, in terms of general contract principles an employment contract may be terminated by notice duly given by either party or by summary termination in the event of a material breach on the part of either party. The death of either party may terminate the employment contract. However, the death of an employer will not necessarily lead to the contract’s termination. An employment contract may also terminate by operation of law or effluxion of time namely retirement and coming into being of fixed-term contracts, by mutual agreement, employee resigning, due to insolvency of the employer and due to <b>supervening</b> <b>impossibility</b> of performance. In the circumstances indicated above, the termination of the contract of employment does not constitute dismissal. This means that the CCMA and the Labour Court do not have jurisdiction to determine should the employee allege that his or her dismissal was unfair. It has been argued that the instances where a termination of a contract of employment is terminated, but there is no dismissal should be scrutinised to avoid a situation where employees are deprived of protection afforded by the fundamental right not to be unfairly dismissed. There have been some instances where employment contracts contain clauses that provide for automatic termination of employment contracts. It has been held by the courts in various decisions that such clauses are against public policy and thus invalid. The Labour Court stated that a contractual device that renders the termination of a contract something other than a dismissal is exactly the exploitation the LRA prohibits There are various court decisions providing guidelines of circumstances in which termination of employment may be regarded as not constituting dismissal. The main focus of the treatise is to discuss these instances and critically analyse the approach taken by forums like the CCMA, bargaining councils and the Labour Court in dealing with such instance...|$|E
