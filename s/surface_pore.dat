The several subtypes of Ergtoxin (e.g. CeErg4 and CeErg5) block voltage-gated K+ hERG-related channels,. Owing to small differences in sequence, the different toxins show selectivity towards specific hERG-channels.Two concurrent modes of action for these toxins have been reported: 1.) blocking channel conductance by interacting with the outer vestibule of the channel or at the extracellular <b>surface</b> <b>pore</b> domains S5-S6, and 2.) interference with channel gating through interaction with the voltage-sensing domain S1-S4.|$|E

The Weber number is the dimensionless parameter that determines the onset of this phenomenon called the entrainment limit (Weber number greater than or equal to 1).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Development of {{microporous}} {{materials with}} hierarchical structures of both micro/mesopores leads to molecular transport at nanometer length scales. For novel microporous materials including three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous imprinted (3 DOm-i) zeolites and zeolite nano-sheets, particle dimensions are below 35 nm resulting in surface-dominated structures. At the same time, {{the existence of}} surface-controlled mass transport including undefined “surface barriers ” has been observed to reduce apparent diffusivity of hydrocarbons by orders of magnitude. This paper systematically characterizes cyclohexane transport in silicalite- 1 by zero length chromatography (ZLC) to determine apparent diffusivity varying over 3 orders of magnitude in particles ranging from 35 nm to 3 μm. Three proposed mechanisms for surface barriers including <b>surface</b> <b>pore</b> narrowing, <b>surface</b> <b>pore</b> blockage, or surface desorption are evaluated by comparison with particle-size/diffusivity data.

40|$|The {{development}} of a composite (Pd-alloy thin film / Porous stainless steel substrate) hydrogen separation membrane was investigated, that is able to operate at high temperatures (600 °C), {{for use in a}} hydrocarbon reformation reactor for the production of pure hydrogen. An intermediated layer of tungsten powder was deposited onto the surface of macroporous 316 L stainless steel (PSS) substrates. This layer served to create an interdiffusion barrier against iron diffusion and also to reduce the <b>surface</b> <b>pore</b> size of the PSS. The dual performance of this intermediate layer within a composite membrane was tested, in terms of <b>surface</b> <b>pore</b> size reduction and ability to prevent interdiffusion. The extent of the powder filling and <b>surface</b> <b>pore</b> reduction was calculated along with the effect on hydrogen transport through the modified substrate. The results showed that both one and three layers of tungsten powder were successful. Production of a defect-free membrane layer was also investigated, coating the tungsten modified PSS substrate with various thicknesses of stainless steel (SS) (as a low-cost proxy for a Pd-alloy thin film). The results showed that a more continuous defect-free membrane layer was achieved when the surface of the substrate was most uniform. The performance of both dense and powdered tungsten intermediate barriers on their ability to prevent iron diffusing into sputtered Pd/PdCu membrane layers, was also investigated. SEM-EDX analysis showed that dense tungsten was very successful at preventing iron diffusion while the powdered particles were also clearly preventing interdiffusion within the pores. It was concluded that a combination of both dense and powdered tungsten would need to be used to fully prevent iron diffusion...|$|E

Although the microscopic patterns of hydrolysis among granules with different crystalline polymorphs were qualitatively similar, the extent {{and the rate of}} amylolysis were different, suggesting that B-type crystalline polymorphs are intrinsically more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis than A-type in rice starch granules. It is proposed that the slightly longer branch lengths of amylopectin which leads to the formation of more stable B-type double helical structures compared to their A-type counterparts is the major parameter, with other factors such as granule size, <b>surface</b> <b>pores</b> and interior channels having secondary roles, in determining the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of rice starch granules.
