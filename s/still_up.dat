The museum is seeking a location near Pearson International Airport, so that it can display some time in 2015, all of its artifacts including a partly restored Avro Lancaster bomber.|$|E

At this point, there was only 7:20 to play in the game, with the Patriots <b>still</b> <b>up</b> by 10 points.|$|E
25|$|With a large {{agricultural}} heritage, {{many farmers}} oppose DST because their days {{are controlled by}} the sun, not the clock.

When the sun is <b>still</b> <b>up</b> at 9pm to 9:30pm, the farmer is still in the field, while others have been off work for hours.|$|E
25|$|In the 1500s, a Spanish expeditionary, Cabeza de Vaca, {{observed}} natives in {{the western}} part of modern-day Florida using sign language, and in the mid-16th century Coronado mentioned that communication with the Tonkawa using signs was possible without a translator. Whether or not these gesture systems reached the stage at which they could properly be called languages is <b>still</b> <b>up</b> for debate.

25|$|Coming {{off their}} bye week, the Crimson Tide {{retained}} their No.7 {{team in the}} AP Poll prior to their game against Kentucky. In {{what was the first}} meeting against the Wildcats since their victory in 1947, Alabama won 35–0 at Birmingham. The Crimson Tide took a 14–0 lead in the first quarter after Terry Davis threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Wayne Wheeler and then scored himself on a three-yard run. <b>Still</b> <b>up</b> only 14–0 as the teams entered the second half, Alabama extended their lead to 21–0 on a three-yard Steve Bisceglia touchdown run.|$|E
25|$|Season twenty-three {{eventually}} {{aired in}} the autumn of 1986. Production of the new season was complicated by various factors. Although the episode length had been reverted to 25minutes, the number of episodes was reduced to fourteen, just over half the length of most previous seasons. The series was <b>still</b> <b>up</b> against The A-Team and, having been off the air for eighteen months, found it hard to regain viewers who had turned to ITV. Saward and Nathan-Turner had decided on an overarching storyline for the entire season entitled The Trial of a Time Lord, but its complexities proved confusing to both writers and viewers, with the season drawing viewing figures of only four to five million.|$|E
25|$|Going {{into the}} final day of the season on December 29, {{eighteen}} teams remained in contention for the twelve available playoff spots. All sixteen of the week seventeen games (all of which were intra-division matchups) were played on Sunday and thirteen had playoff implications. All four division winners in the AFC had been determined, but all four NFC divisions were <b>still</b> <b>up</b> for grabs. In the season's final regular season game on Sunday night, the Eagles defeated the Cowboys 24–22 to capture the NFC East. This was the third straight year that the Cowboys were eliminated from the playoffs with losses in their final game, all of which were against division rivals and all of which were played on Sunday night.|$|E

25|$|On {{the final}} day of the regular season, the AL East was <b>still</b> <b>up</b> for grabs with both the Rays and New York Yankees tied for first place. For the Rays to clinch the division, they needed either a win, or a loss by the Yankees. When all was said and done, both happened, as the Yankees lost to the Boston Red Sox prior to the Rays {{defeating}} the Kansas City Royals in extra innings. In September and October combined, the Rays split 30 games, going 15–15. They finished the regular season 96–66, winning the division by a single game, and finishing one win shy of their franchise record set in 2008. The Rays also had home field advantage through the American League side of the postseason.|$|E
25|$|On 19 February, HSwMS Sverige and HSwMS Oscar II {{carrying}} a company from the Vaxholm Coastal Artillery Regiment arrived Åland {{to press the}} Russians in leaving the islands. The Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet still tried to avoid the armed conflict and on 22 February the political representative Vatslav Vorovsky stated the Russian troops were willing to leave Åland. The order of disarmament was given a day after and the Finnish icebreaker Murtaja took 300 Russians and the Finnish Red Guard fighters to Turku. On 24 February, the 500-man battalion of the Royal Göta Livgarde, commanded by the lieutenant colonel G. E.

25|$|The ICC {{announced}} the hosts {{for the previous}} World Cup, the 2011 competition, on 30 April 2006.

The Trans-Tasman bid, Beyond Boundaries, was the only bid for 2011 delivered to the ICC headquarters at Dubai before the 1 March deadline. Considerable merits of the bid included the superior venues and infrastructure, and the total support of the Australian and New Zealand governments on tax and custom issues during the tournament, according to Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland. The New Zealand government had also assured that the Zimbabwean team {{would be allowed to}} take part in the tournament after political discussions about whether their team would be allowed to tour Zimbabwe in 2005.|$|E

25|$|The new King — William II of Scotland — {{was from}} a Dutch Presbyterian {{background}} but was wary of scope for unrest in such a structure, without some safeguards. These his successor (Queen Anne) finally introduced in 1712 by the Patronage Act. This gave the power to nominate Parish Ministers to local landowners — the Heritors. It was <b>still</b> <b>up</b> to the Kirk Session to appoint another person (with the agreement of the Presbytery), but this would be without the salary, house, etc., provided by the Heritors. This ancient power had been abolished in 1649, (during the Commonwealth), restored (with the Restoration in 1660 and abolished {{in the first place}} by William in 1690 before he re-imposed it in 1712). It led to many struggles between Kirk Sessions and Heritors throughout the 18th and 19th Centuries — including the appointment of Mr M’Culloch — and finally to three secessions from the Kirk.|$|E
25|$|Wetzlar lies on {{the eastern}} edge of the Rhenish Massif. The {{substrate}} consists of geologically young sediments of the Lahn and much older Devonian and Carboniferous rocks of the two main geological units of the Massif, the Lahnmulde and the so-called Giessen nappe. The northwestern part of the urban area {{lies on the}} Lahntal silt, sand and gravel, which have only slightly hardened. They were deposited by the River Lahn, at a point where its valley (which is <b>still</b> <b>up</b> to one kilometre wide) to the west becomes increasingly narrow and deep. The main part of the city is built on in part intensively folded, faulted and slated layers of shales, sandstone, quartzite and limestone. They were deposited in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods in a sea characterised by island chains, volcanoes and atolls that were pushed together and covered by a layer of rock that had been transported from another location during the period of mountain building known as the Variscan orogeny. The marine sedimentary rocks which resulted from this tectonic action now give the town its character as they were often used for building material.|$|E
25|$|Commaille {{resumed his}} {{first-class}} cricket career with matches against the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team in 1919–20, and when proper domestic competition returned in 1920–21 he was immediately far {{more successful than}} he had been in any season pre-War. In the first Western Province game of the season against a very weak Border team he made 156, more than the opposing team made in their two innings combined. Later in the season he hit a second century against Griqualand West. There were tours to South Africa by Australia in 1921–22 and England in 1922–23, and Commaille played in the Western Province games against both sides, but did not earn a Test recall. In 1923–24 at the age of 40, he had his best domestic season, with unbeaten centuries against Natal and Griqualand West, and with places <b>still</b> <b>up</b> for grabs on the 1924 tour to England Commaille captained one of two trial sides in an end-of-season match, after which the team was chosen. Commaille's team lost the match to Neville Lindsay's team convincingly, but Commaille was picked for the tour and Lindsay was not.|$|E
