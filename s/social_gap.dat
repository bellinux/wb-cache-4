500|$|In the 1840s Disraeli wrote a trilogy {{of novels}} with {{political}} themes. With Coningsby; or, The New Generation (1844), Disraeli, in Blake's view, [...] "infused the novel genre with political sensibility, espousing {{the belief that}} England's future as a world power depended not on the complacent old guard, but on youthful, idealistic politicians." [...] Coningsby [...] was followed by Sybil; or, The Two Nations (1845), another political novel, which was less idealistic and more clear-eyed than Coningsby; the [...] "two nations" [...] of its sub-title referred to the huge economic and <b>social</b> <b>gap</b> between the privileged few and the deprived working classes. The last in Disraeli's political novel trilogy was Tancred; or, The New Crusade (1847), promoting the Church of England's role in reviving Britain's flagging spirituality.|$|E
500|$|Anne Bower {{writes about}} Jewish {{characters}} at mealtime {{as part of}} the broader movement she believes started in the 1960s where filmmakers started producing work that explored the [...] "Jewish self-definition." [...] She postulates that the dinner table becomes an arena where Jewish characters are often and most pointedly put into [...] "conflicts with their ethnic and sexual selves." [...] She describes the example of Greg sitting down for dinner with the Byrnes family and being asked to bless the food. In this scene, Greg attempts to recite a prayer by improvising and, in doing so, launches into a recital of the song [...] "Day by Day" [...] from Act I of Godspell. Bower notes this scene as [...] "particularly important for establishing the cultural distance" [...] between the Jewish Greg and the Christian Byrnes. She noted that the <b>social</b> <b>gap</b> is further widened next morning when Greg is the last person to arrive at the breakfast table; he shows up wearing pajamas while everyone else is fully clothed. Here Greg is shown eating a bagel, which Bower argues as being a clear signifier of Jewishness.|$|E

2500|$|It also, {{with the}} help of USAID, created a massive {{industrial}} infrastructure, communications, and developed the educational system. Several government bodies were created and four-year plans were also enacted. Between 1952 and 1982, economic growth was on average 8.7%, and between 1983 and 1986 at 6.9%. The gross national product grew by 360% between 1965 and 1986. The percentage of global exports was over 2% in 1986, over other recently industrialized countries, (like South Korea), and the global industrial production output grew a further 680% between 1965 and 1986. The <b>social</b> <b>gap</b> between {{the rich and the poor}} fell (Gini: 0.558 in 1953, 0.303 in 1980), even lower than some Western European countries, but it grew a little in the 80's. Health care, education, and [...] quality of life also improved. Much of that was made possible through US economic aid, subsidizing the higher cost of domestic production. The flexibility of the productive system and the industrial structure meant that Taiwanese companies had more chances to adapt themselves to the changing international situation and the global economy.|$|E
2500|$|Lizzie Hexam – is a {{daughter}} of Gaffer Hexam and sister of Charley Hexam. She is an affectionate daughter, but knows that Charley must escape their living circumstances {{if he is to}} succeed in life, so she gives Charley her money and helps him leave while their father is away. Later she is rejected by Charley after she remains in poverty. Pursued romantically by both Bradley Headstone and Eugene Wrayburn, she fears Headstone's violent passion and yearns for Wrayburn's love, while acutely aware of the <b>social</b> <b>gap</b> between them. Lizzie saves Wrayburn from Headstone's attack and the two are married. She in effect acts as the moral centre of the story and is by far the [...] "most wholly good character [...] almost bereft of ego". Dickens carries over her moral superiority into her physical characterisation. Her [...] "capacity for self-sacrifice [...] is only slightly more credible than her gift for refined speech", making her slightly unbelievable in comparison to her uneducated father and Jenny Wren. Lizzie's concern about social class reveals her reasoning for ensuring her brother's escape from poverty and ignorance, though she remains humble about her own situation. However, her moral character attracts Wrayburn and her inherent goodness is rewarded with marital happiness.|$|E
2500|$|The {{establishment}} of Sămănătorul was linked by researchers {{to a set}} of significant events of fin de siècle European economic history. Spanish historian Francisco Veiga placed the emergence of Sămănătorul in direct connection to a European-wide evolution of capitalism and related phenomena affecting the middle class: [...] "In the traumatic circumstances of late 19th and early 20th century imperialist crises [...] and the rejection of urban-industrial society by the petty and medium bourgeoisie threatened by the crisis of capitalism, Sămănătorism can be identified with those groups of intellectual movements seeking to preserve national identity in front of threats, by resorting to an idealized past." [...] Alongside the [...] "identity crisis" [...] provoked by [...] "the traumatic advance of industrial modernization inside a country with a majority peasant and illiterate population", researcher Paul Cernat discusses the [...] "decline" [...] of local boyar aristocracy as issues preparing the ground for Sămănătorul and like-minded journals. Likewise, Swedish art historian Tom Sandqvist views Sămănătoruls focus on the peasant community as a source of legitimate culture as connected with economic change and [...] "emerging industrialization": [...] "In the mid-1870s grain prices had declined catastrophically, and it became more and more obvious that the image of the grateful farmer and the 'natural' village community as bearer of true Romanian culture was false and did not correspond very well with a reality characterized by utmost poverty, misery, autocratic boyars, ruthless profiteers, moneylenders, and village gendarmes". The emergence of Sămănătorism and Poporanism, Sandqvist notes, happened [...] "in spite of this—or rather because of it", since both still proclaimed [...] "the special character of Romanian culture as deriving from the traditional village community." [...] Researcher Rodica Lascu-Pop presents a similar perspective, discussing Sămănătorism as [...] "an echo of mutations occurring in society {{at the beginning of the}} century: the acute crisis of the peasant issue , the <b>social</b> <b>gap</b> between the urban and rural environments." ...|$|E

60|$|Both {{the work}} of {{research}} and {{the work of}} dissemination went on under serious handicaps. One of these was the great <b>social</b> <b>gap</b> that separated the philosopher, who was a gentleman, from the trader and the artisan. There were glass workers and metal workers in abundance in those days, but they were not in mental contact with the thinkers. The glass worker was making the most beautifully coloured beads and phials and so forth, but he never made a Florentine flask or a lens. Clear glass {{does not seem to have}} interested him. The metal worker made weapons and jewellery but he never made a chemical balance. The philosopher speculated loftily about atoms and the nature of things, but he had no practical experience of enamels and pigments and philters and so forth. He was not interested in substances. So Alexandria in its brief day of opportunity produced no microscopes and no chemistry. And though Hero invented a steam engine it was never set either to pump or drive a boat or do any useful thing. There were few practical applications of science except in the realm of medicine, and the progress of science was not stimulated and sustained by the interest and excitement of practical applications. There was nothing to keep the work going therefore when the intellectual curiosity of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II {153} was withdrawn. The discoveries of the Museum went on record in obscure manuscripts and never, until the revival of scientific curiosity at the Renascence, reached out to the mass of mankind.|$|E

40|$|Pre-school {{education}} and care (PSEC) is often claimed as a ‘win-win’ policy which simultaneously enhances both economic competitiveness and ocial cohesion. High levels of PSEC {{are said to}} raise living standards by increasing female employment rates and improving young people’s skills and to mitigate inequalities by reducing <b>social</b> <b>gaps</b> in learning outcomes. Much of the evidence for this rests on analysis of data for a small umber of countries. In this paper we test the claims using cross-national time series data for {{a large number of}} OECD countries. The analysis of determinants of employment rates, using a variety of controls, does confirm the association between PSEC participation levels and female mployment rates. However, the cross-national analysis does not support the argument that raising aggregate levels of PSEC participation ecessarily reduces <b>social</b> <b>gaps</b> in attainment at 15 years of age. Participation in PSEC increases educational performance at 15 by similar amounts for children of all social groups in most countries. <b>Social</b> <b>gaps</b> in performance at 15 may only be mitigated by high levels of PSEC provision where children from less advantaged families get more – or better quality – provision. The recently announced Department for Education plan to extend free provision of PSEC for fifteen hours a week to two-year-old children from disadvantaged families (i. e. in care or qualifying for free school eals) therefore points in the right direction. However, {{it remains to be seen}} whether this will bias participation towards this group sufficiently to reduce inequalities in learning outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Fit {{between an}} organization’s brand and its employees, {{sometimes}} referred to as employee brand identification, has been highlighted as an important element of delivering service quality. This paper examines the people management practices directed both at potential and current employees which enhance this ‘person-brand fit’ and proposes that effective management of this can help reduce the persistent problem of <b>social</b> skills <b>gaps</b> in service organizations. A study of managers and customer-facing employees in two hotel case studies – one reporting significant <b>social</b> skills <b>gaps</b> and the other reporting few gaps – showed that the hotel reporting fewer gaps had achieved greater employee identification with the brand. This hotel conducted recruitment and selection around person-brand fit, whilst the other hotel did not. The hotel reporting fewer <b>social</b> skills <b>gaps</b> also allowed greater employee agency in brand socialization, training and in the enactment of the brand on the job. The paper discusses the relevance of these findings for theory on how human resource management (HRM) practices may be linked to service brands in order to reduce <b>social</b> skills <b>gaps...</b>|$|R
