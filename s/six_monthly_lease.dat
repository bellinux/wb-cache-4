40|$|Public {{distribution}} {{system is a}} food security program in India providing safety net for the below poverty line citizens of the country. Its objective is to feed the most vulnerable population by providing subsidized food grains and other essential commodities {{on a monthly basis}} through its integrated network of supply chain. But the system is affected by various inefficiencies and malpractices. To improve the efficacy of the system, the state of Punjab introduced the new atta-daal (wheat pulses) scheme. One of the features of the scheme was to distribute grains to the beneficiaries on a <b>six</b> <b>monthly</b> basis (semi-annually) instead of on a monthly basis. With the change in interval of grain distribution, the policy makers estimated huge financial savings for the state and improved grain quality and quantity for the beneficiaries of the system. But an exploratory research visit suggested some concerns from the beneficiaries such as problems with grain handling and one-time payments. Beneficiaries {{play a critical role in}} successful implementation of any new policy directly affecting their livelihoods. Therefore it is essential to understand their perspective. This research is an attempt to analyze and understand the policy through beneficiaries’ viewpoint. The first study investigated the factors affecting the preference of beneficiaries for <b>six</b> <b>monthly</b> {{distribution system}}. Historically, their preference for a policy is affected by various socio-economic, demographic and institutional factors. This study was conducted in two stages where-in an exploratory research visit with 40 participants among seven stakeholders helped in defining the research problem and resulted in thematic codes which further helped in designing a survey. Thereafter a survey was conducted among 300 beneficiaries across eight rural and six urban locations in district of Ludhiana in Punjab. Analysis of the data using logistical regression modelling yielded several facilitating, impeding and demographic factors which affect beneficiaries’ preference to successfully adopt the new policy. These factors included “monthly hassle”, “perception of leakages in system”, “storage challenges”, “interval of grain distribution”, “one-time down payment”, “trade of bulk grains by family”, “exploitation by middle-men”, “communication of arrival of grains”, “gender”, “area” (rural/urban) and “nature of employment”. A deeper understanding of these factors helped authors make policy suggestions to the policy makers. The second study uses multi-attribute utility theory for a formal decision analysis of the <b>six</b> <b>monthly</b> distribution system and its various identified alternatives from beneficiaries’ perspective. Authors use the data collected during exploratory research visits and survey conducted with 300 beneficiaries to identify the overall objective of introducing the policy change. This data is further used to identify various alternatives to <b>six</b> <b>monthly</b> distribution system and the best alternative for beneficiaries. Authors compare all the alternatives to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses and further make suggestions to improve the status quo. Five feasible “alternatives” for <b>six</b> <b>monthly</b> interval of grain distribution (status quo) were quarterly distribution, annual distribution, the old one monthly system, a one monthly system with new regulations and an improved <b>six</b> <b>monthly</b> distribution system. The improved <b>six</b> <b>monthly</b> system was identified as the best solution among given alternatives. A sensitivity analysis established the robustness of the solution...|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{vertical}} monopoly, by 1940 the Bell System effectively owned most telephone service in the United States, from local and long-distance service to the telephones themselves. This allowed Bell to prohibit its customers from connecting phones not made or sold by Bell to the system without paying fees. For example, if a customer desired a type of phone not leased by the local Bell monopoly, he or she had to purchase the phone at cost, give it to the phone company, then pay a 're-wiring' charge and a <b>monthly</b> <b>lease</b> fee in order to use it.|$|R

50|$|This {{also applies}} to customer-premises equipment, such as cable and DSL modems.

In cases where the provider allows customers to provide their own equipment (and thus avoid the <b>monthly</b> <b>leasing</b> fee on their bill,) the provider requires that the customer give them the MAC address of their equipment before service will be established.|$|R
