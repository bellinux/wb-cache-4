2500|$|Efforts {{to survey}} a new, shorter, [...] "better" [...] route {{had been under}} way since 1864. By 1867, a new route was found and {{surveyed}} that went along part of the South Platte River in western Nebraska and after entering {{what is now the}} state of Wyoming, ascended a gradual <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge</b> between Lodgepole Creek and Crow Creek to [...] Evans pass (also called Sherman's Pass) which was discovered by the Union Pacific employed English surveyor and engineer, James Evans, in about 1864. This pass now is marked by the Ames Monument (41.131281,-105.398045 lat., long.) marking its significance and commemorating two of the main backers of the Union Pacific Railroad. From North Platte, Nebraska (elevation [...] ), the railroad proceeded westward and upward along a new path across the Nebraska Territory and Wyoming Territory (then part of the Dakota Territory) along the north bank of the South Platte River and into what would become the state of Wyoming at Lone Pine, Wyoming. Evans Pass was located between what would become the new [...] "railroad" [...] towns of Cheyenne and Laramie. Connecting to this pass, about [...] west of Cheyenne, was the one place across the Laramie Mountains that had a narrow [...] "guitar neck" [...] of land that crossed the mountains without serious erosion at the so-called [...] "gangplank" [...] (41.099746,-105.153205 lat., long.) discovered by Major General Grenville Dodge in 1865 {{when he was in the}} U.S. Army. The new route surveyed across Wyoming was over [...] shorter, had a flatter profile, allowed for cheaper and easier railroad construction, and also went closer by Denver and the known coalfields in the Wasatch and Laramie Ranges.|$|E
60|$|Standing, breathless, a pace or two apart, {{they saw}} Vane {{and the girl}} appear from beneath the willows and wash away down-stream. The man was {{swimming}} but he was hampered by his burden, and once he and Mabel sank almost from sight in a whirling eddy. Carroll said nothing, but he turned and ran along the <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge,</b> until where the fall was less and the trees were thinner he leaped out into the air. He broke through the alders amidst a rustle of bending boughs and disappeared; but a moment later his head rose {{out of the water}} close beside Vane, and the two men went down-stream with Mabel between them.|$|E
60|$|The Old Town {{occupies}} a <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge</b> or tail of diluvial matter, protected, in some subsidence of the waters, by the Castle cliffs which fortify {{it to the}} west. On the one side {{of it and the}} other the new towns of the south and of the north occupy their lower, broader, and more gentle hill-tops. Thus, the quarter of the Castle over-tops the whole city and keeps an open view to sea and land. It dominates for miles on every side; and people on the decks of ships, or ploughing in quiet country places over in Fife, can see the banner on the Castle battlements, and the smoke of the Old Town blowing abroad over the subjacent country. A city that is set upon a hill. It was, I suppose, from this distant aspect that she got her nickname of Auld Reekie. Perhaps it was given her by people who had never crossed her doors: day after day, from their various rustic Pisgahs, they had seen the pile of building on the hill-top, and the long plume of smoke over the plain; so it appeared to them; so it had appeared to their fathers tilling the same field; and as that was all they knew of the place, it could be all expressed in these two words.|$|E

50|$|Aspidotis {{is a small}} genus of leptosporangiate ferns known {{commonly}} as laceferns. Most {{species are}} native to <b>slopes,</b> <b>ridges,</b> and rocky outcroppings, primarily in California and Mexico, although one species included in the genus by some authorities is widely distributed in eastern Africa.|$|R
50|$|Ridge lift, or Orographic lift, {{is caused}} by rising air on the {{windward}} side of a <b>slope.</b> <b>Ridge</b> lift is used extensively by sea birds and by aircraft. In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft.|$|R
60|$|These threads {{therefore}} I find to be a congeries {{of small}} Laminæ or plates, as eeeee, &c. {{each of them}} shap'd much like this of abcd, in the fourth Figure, the part ac being a ridge, prominency, or stem, and b and d the corners of two small thin Plates that grow unto the small stalk in the middle, so that they make a kind of little feather; each of these Plates lie one close to another, almost like a company of <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge</b> or gutter Tyles; they grow {{on each side of}} the stalk opposite to one another, by two and two, from top to bottom, in the manner express'd in the fifth Figure, the tops of the lower covering the roots of the next above them; the under side of each of these laminated bodies, is of a very dark and opacous substance, and suffers very few Rays to be trajected, but reflects them all toward that side from whence they come, much like the foil of a Looking-glass; but their upper sides seem to me to consist of a multitude of thin plated bodies, which are exceeding thin, and lie very close together, and thereby, like mother of Pearl shells, do not onely reflect a very brisk light, but tinge that light in a most curious manner; and by means of various positions, in respect of the light, they reflect back now one colour, and then another, and those most vividly.|$|E

50|$|A TIN is {{typically}} {{based on a}} Delaunay triangulation, but its utility will be limited by the selection of input data points: well-chosen points will be located so as to capture significant changes in surface form, such as topographical summits, breaks of <b>slope,</b> <b>ridges,</b> valley floors, pits, and cols.|$|R
50|$|Rodriguez {{is a town}} of {{mountains}}. From {{its north}} to south, a series of <b>sloping</b> <b>ridges,</b> hills and mountains ranges adorn the town.

50|$|Plymouth Hoe, {{referred}} to locally as the Hoe, {{is a large}} south facing open public space in the English coastal city of Plymouth. The Hoe is adjacent to and above the low limestone cliffs that form the seafront and it commands views of Plymouth Sound, Drake's Island, and across the Hamoaze to Mount Edgcumbe in Cornwall. The name derives from the Anglo-Saxon word Hoe, a <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge</b> shaped like an inverted foot and heel.|$|E
50|$|Several hill forts are dotted {{around the}} Clee Hills. Nordy Bank {{is the last}} intact {{survivor}} of three Iron Age hill forts on Brown Clee. The other two, at Abdon Burf and Clee Burf, have been largely lost to quarrying activity. Nordy Bank occupies a <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge</b> top site and its ramparts are up to three metres high.

50|$|Inala {{was planned}} as a {{satellite}} town {{set on a}} broad high, gently <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge</b> about 18 km from the Brisbane General Post Office. The development of the housing designs for the estate coincided {{with the emergence of}} architectural modernism in Australia. The innovative designs of young southern architects such as Robin Boyd, Roy Grounds and Harry Seidler featured the efficient use of space with minimal ornamentation, utilisation of new materials and techniques, and above all design simplicity, while striving to build solid houses that would require little maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Thicketty Mountain Ore Pits (38CK74) is a {{historic}} archaeological site located near Shady Grove Church, Cherokee County, South Carolina. The site includes iron ore pits associated with the South Carolina Manufacturing Company, a major iron manufacturing company that operated in Spartanburg County between about 1825 and about 1850. The iron ore pits or surface mines cover several forested acres along a gently <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge</b> and are generally depressions about two to three meters deep and about five to ten meters across. The pits were last operational in the 1850s.|$|E
50|$|Quetzalpetlatl Corona {{contains}} within {{itself a}} younger, smaller corona named Boala Corona, which is {{situated at the}} summit of Lada Rise and is speculated to have contributed partly to the vast extent of Quetzalpetlatl Corona's massive lava flows. This corona is much different than its surrounding companion, with the smaller of the two featuring a shallow depression surrounded by a gently <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge</b> (the opposite of Quetzalpetlatl Corona). The lava flows produced by the shield volcanoes at its base, {{as well as most}} flows observed on Venus to date, seem to preferentially produce pahoehoe-type flows, and the reasons behind this are still unclear.|$|E
40|$|We {{will examine}} the {{waveguide}} mode losses in ridge-guided quantum cascade lasers. Our analysis illustrates how the low-loss mode for broad-ridge quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) can be a higher-order lateral waveguide mode that maximizes the feedback from the sloped ridge-wall regions. The results are in excellent agreement with the near- and far-field data taken on broad-ridge-guided quantum cascade lasers processed with <b>sloped</b> <b>ridge</b> walls...|$|R

5000|$|Prestonville {{covers a}} <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge</b> of {{land on the}} western side of the valley through which London Road and the Brighton Main Line run. The land drops down steeply from Dyke Road, the ancient route to Devil's Dyke on the South Downs. [...] Now one of the city's major roads, it formed the {{historic}} boundary between the parishes of Hove and Preston. Later, when Preston became part of Brighton, Dyke Road formed the border between the Boroughs of Hove and Brighton. [...] The centre of Brighton is about 1.2 miles (2 km) to the southeast, and central Hove lies to the southwest.|$|E
50|$|Prestonville is {{a largely}} {{residential}} {{area in the}} northwest of Brighton, part of the English city of Brighton and Hove. It covers a long, narrow and steeply <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge</b> of land between the Brighton Main Line and Dyke Road, two major transport corridors which run north-northwestwards from the centre of Brighton. Residential development started in the 1860s and spread northwards, further from central Brighton, {{over the next six}} decades. The area is characterised by middle-class and upper-middle-class housing in various styles, small-scale commercial development and long eastward views across the city. Two Anglican churches serve Prestonville—one {{at each end of the}} area—and there are several listed buildings.|$|E
50|$|The fortlet of Upper Zohar is {{situated}} {{on a flat}} shelf of a steeply <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge</b> on the northern side of a hill known as Rosh Zohar (Zohar Head), southeast of Arad. Unreferenced by ancient sources, its ancient name is unknown. It appears as Khirbet Gazza in Albrecht Alt's writings and is also correctly marked in the British Mandate for Palestine maps, both from the 1930s. It appears again in Mordechai Gichon's writings about the Limes Palaestinae, but was only excavated between 1985 and 1986 by a team from the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem led by Richard P. Harper. The final excavation report was published in 1997.|$|E

50|$|The mountainous {{regions of}} the Municipality of Rodriguez are found at the central and eastern areas, with sleepy <b>sloping</b> <b>ridges</b> and mountainranges, {{traversing}} north to south. The terrain in these mountain ranges has slopes ranging from 30-50%. Very steep hills and mountains have slopes greater than 50%. Rolling to hilly areas 18-30% in slope can also be found. These high elevations are drained by several major rivers, namely the Tanay, Puray, and Rodriguez Rivers.|$|R
50|$|The {{name was}} first attested in 1612 as 'Midrim' (modern Welsh 'Meidrim') in a volume {{entitled}} 'Llyfr Plygain 1612'. As {{explained by the}} Welsh scholar Ifor Williams in his treatise on Welsh place-names (Enwau Lleoedd, 1945), it is a compound name derived from 'mei' (half, middle, cf. Latin 'medius') and the mutated form of the noun 'trum' (<b>slope,</b> <b>ridge,</b> peak, range of hills etc, Old Irish 'druimm'; cf. the Cornish place-name 'Pendrim').|$|R
50|$|The {{cliffs of}} Lover's Leap run {{horizontally}} through the Eldorado National Forest {{for over a}} third of a mile (0.6 km), with heights between 250-600 feet (76-183 m). The formation faces towards the northwest, and lie just south of Route 50, between Lake Tahoe and Sacramento. The historic Pony Express trail roughly parallels Route 50, and runs directly beneath Lover's Leap. The closest major urban center is the Tahoe area about 10 miles to the northeast. The cliff is at the northern terminus of a <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge</b> that runs southwest for six miles to the peak of Little Round Top. The Forest Service operates the nearby Lover's Leap Campground, and the historic Strawberry Lodge is also nearby.|$|E
50|$|The ancient {{village of}} Sant Llorenç de Balàfia, is often just {{known by the}} name Balàfia. This name derives from a time past when this was a Moorish village. The oldest part of the village {{consists}} of a grouping of seven houses which includes two refuge towers and two trulls (Olive Oil Press). From the main road (C733) a narrow lane branches away and passes close to an old well before winding {{its way through the}} aforementioned group of houses. The original builders believed in strength through numbers as shown by the way this settlement was built, with the dwellings in close proximity to each other. The seven house are strung out along a gently <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge</b> running north to south.|$|E
50|$|Snake Hill (known officially as Laurel Hill) is an {{igneous rock}} {{intrusion}} jutting {{up from the}} floor of the Meadowlands in southern Secaucus, New Jersey, USA, at a bend in the Hackensack River. It was largely obliterated in the 1960s by quarrying that reduced the height of some sections by one-quarter and the area of its base by four fifths. The diabase rock was used as building material in growing areas like Jersey City. The remnant of the hill is the defining feature of Laurel Hill County Park. The high point, a 203-foot (62 m) graffiti-covered inselberg rock formation, is a familiar landmark to travelers on the New Jersey Turnpike's Eastern Spur, which skirts the hill's southern edge. The crest of the hill's unusual, <b>sloping</b> <b>ridge</b> is about 150 feet (46 m) high.|$|E
