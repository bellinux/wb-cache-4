Hence {{this leads to the}} development of composites, which nearly suffice the above two conditions. Composite material is a material composed of two or more distinct phases (matrix phase and reinforcing phase) and having bulk properties significantly different from those of any of the constituents. In this developing age for iron industry there is large demand for spherodial <b>Graphite</b> <b>iron</b> (S. G. Iron). S. G. Iron also known as a composite in which the matrix consists of ferrite and/or pearlite and reinforcing component is graphite nodules which present in it. SG Iron also referred to as nodular cast iron or ductile cast <b>Iron</b> or <b>spherulitic</b> <b>graphite</b> cast <b>iron.</b> The scientist discovered the S. G. Iron in 1948. It is a special variety of cast iron having carbon content more than 3 % and has graphite present in compact, spherical shapes. These compact spheroids hamper the continuity of the matrix much less than graphite flakes which results in higher strength and toughness which imparting superior mechanical properties i. e. much higher than all other cast irons and which can be compared to steels. This unique property enables S. G. irons to be used for numerous industrial applications. Tensile strength of S. G. Iron will be abou...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{influence}} of alloying elements on the chill formation in Compacted <b>Graphite</b> <b>Iron</b> (CGI) is investigated. Chill wedges cast {{in an industrial}} foundry were used to investigate the chill formation.

Three wedges were cast for each alloy composition, of which one was used for measuring the temperature at three different heights in the wedge. Contrary to some previous reports, {{the results indicate that}} low-nodularity CGI is not more prone to chill formation (columnar white) than high-nodularity CGI.

Testing was carried out on a bespoke impact wear test rig {{to look at the}} effect of the material properties, before and after hardening, on the level of wear. Three different types of specimen were tested; untreated CGI, CGI induction hardened to a nominal depth of 2 mm and CGI induction hardened to a nominal depth of 3 mm.

The induction hardening improved the impact wear resistance of the compacted <b>graphite</b> <b>iron</b> and when compared to the laser hardened cast iron it performed much better.

The study involved the cast iron containing copper at a concentration up to approximately 4 %. The effect of copper on the temperature of the eutectic crystallization as well as the temperature of start and finish of the austenite transformation was given. It has been shown that copper increases the maximum temperature of the eutectic transformation approximately by 5 °C per 1 % Cu, and the temperature of the this transformation finish approximately by 8 °C per 1 % Cu. This element decreases the temperature of the austenite transformation start approximately by 5 °C per 1 % Cu, and the finish of this transformation approximately by 6 °C per 1 % Cu.
