500|$|The term [...] "dessert" [...] {{comes from}} the Old French desservir, [...] "to clear a table", {{literally}} [...] "to un-serve", and originated during the Middle Ages. It would typically consist of dragées and mulled wine accompanied by aged cheese, and by the Late Middle Ages could also include fresh fruit covered in <b>sugar,</b> <b>honey</b> or syrup and boiled-down fruit pastes. Sugar, from its first appearance in Europe, was viewed {{as much as a}} drug as a sweetener; its long-lived medieval reputation as an exotic luxury encouraged its appearance in elite contexts accompanying meats and other dishes that to modern taste are more naturally savoury. There was a wide variety of fritters, crêpes with sugar, sweet custards and darioles, almond milk and eggs in a pastry shell that could also include fruit and sometimes even bone marrow or fish. German-speaking areas had a particular fondness for krapfen: fried pastries and dough with various sweet and savory fillings. Marzipan in many forms was well known in Italy and southern France by the 1340s and is assumed to be of Arab origin. Anglo-Norman cookbooks are full of recipes for sweet and savory custards, potages, sauces and tarts with strawberries, cherries, apples and plums. The English chefs also had a penchant for using flower petals such as roses, violets, and elder flowers. An early form of quiche can be found in Forme of Cury, a 14th-century recipe collection, as a Torte de Bry with a cheese and egg yolk filling. [...] Le Ménagier de Paris ("Parisian Household Book") written in 1393 includes a quiche recipe made with three kinds of cheese, eggs, beet greens, spinach, fennel fronds, and parsley.|$|E

2500|$|Called a “St. Francis of the wilderness,” [...] Sheffey was {{renowned for}} his {{concern about the}} welfare of animals. [...] He once {{dismounted}} to collect tadpoles in his handkerchief {{so that he could}} transfer them to a stream from a small pool where they were certain to die. [...] Others he tried to save by bringing water to their mud hole. [...] Sheffey regularly stopped to right beetles and dropped out of funeral processions to lift insects {{out of the way of}} wagon wheels. [...] He gave his lunch to hungry dogs and tried (unsuccessfully) to “relieve” flies caught on sticky paper. [...] Once when his brother-in-law cut a wasp in two with a pair of scissors, Sheffey went out to the yard and starting praying. [...] When the brother-in-law asked why, he replied, “I am praying for the Lord to make another wasp to take the place of the one you killed.” [...] Sheffey was especially solicitous of his horse. [...] He specifically instructed hosts how to water and feed his horse, and he often dismounted rather than make the horse carry him up a steep grade. Sheffey had a sweet tooth and would often fill his mouth with <b>sugar,</b> <b>honey,</b> or maple syrup. [...] He regularly prayed, “Lord, bless the little honeybees for they make sweet honey. Like sweet Jesus.” ...|$|E
