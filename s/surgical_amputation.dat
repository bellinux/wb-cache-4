6000|$|Diderot's {{answer to}} the {{question}} is an anticipation of the main position of the famous little book which appeared fifteen years afterwards, and which has been well described as the Organum of æsthetic cultivation. In Laocoön Lessing contends against Spence, the author of Polymetis against Caylus, and others of his contemporaries, that poetry and painting are divided from one another in aim, in effects, in reach, by the limits set upon each by the nature of its own material.[62] So Diderot says that the painter could not seize the Virgilian moment, because a body that is partially immersed in water is disfigured by an effect of refraction, which a faithful painter would be bound to reproduce; because the image of the body could not be seen transparently through the stormy waters, and therefore the god would have the appearance of being decapitated; because it is indispensable, if you would avoid the impression of a <b>surgical</b> <b>amputation,</b> that some visible portion of hidden limbs should be there to inform us of the existence of the rest.[63] He takes another instance, where a description that is admirable in poetry would be insupportable in painting. Who, he asks, could bear upon canvas the sight of Polyphemus grinding between his teeth the bones of one of the companions of Ulysses? Who could see without horror a giant holding a man in his enormous mouth, with blood dripping over his head and breast? ...|$|E

Results: We identified 17 diabetic patients, all type 2, aged 58. 11 ± 10. 8 years and 12. 4 ± 8. 4 years of disease, 58. 8 % male. Of ulcers, 41. 1 % were grade 2; 35. 2 % grade 3; 11. 7 % grade 4 and 11. 7 % grade 5 of Wagner; 64. 7 % with less than 3 months of evolution. Debridement was performed in 82. 3 % of patients and amputation in 47 %; osteomyelitis was identified in 47 % of cases. All patients started empiric antibiotic therapy, where ciprofloxacin/metronidazole was the most used scheme (76. 5 %). Cultures were negative in 12. 5 % of the patients.

30|$|In conclusion, {{the final}} result of {{lengthening}} for FH {{is dependent on the}} final foot position after reconstruction. It is essential to obtain a plantigrade stable foot to ensure a satisfactory result. The SHORDT or the SUPERankle procedures are the best method to obtain and maintain a plantigrade stable foot. The few cases that are too dysplastic or fail these procedures can be salvaged successfully with ankle fusion. Serial lengthenings and epiphysiodesis, performed at well-spaced intervals during childhood, will equalize the leg length discrepancy. In light of these results all patients should be given the option of <b>surgical</b> reconstruction versus <b>amputation.</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{describe}} and quantify patterns of injury from antipersonnel mines {{in terms of}} distribution of injury, drain on surgical resources, and residual disability. DESIGN [...] Retrospective analysis. SETTING [...] Two hospitals for patients injured in war. SUBJECTS [...] 757 patients with injuries from antipersonnel mines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Distribution and number of injuries; number of blood transfusions; number of operations; disability. RESULTS [...] Pattern 1 injury results from standing on a buried mine. These patients usually sustain traumatic amputation of the foot or leg; they use most surgical time and blood and invariably require <b>surgical</b> <b>amputation</b> of one or both lower limbs. Pattern 2 injury is a more random collection of penetrating injuries caused by multiple fragments from a mine triggered near the victim. The lower limb is injured but there is less chance of traumatic amputation or subsequent <b>surgical</b> <b>amputation.</b> Injuries to the head, neck, chest, or abdomen are common. Pattern 3 injury results from handling a mine: the victim sustains severe upper limb injuries with associated face injuries. Eye injuries are common in all groups. CONCLUSIONS [...] Patients who survive standing on a buried mine have greatest disability. Non-combatants are at risk from these weapons; in developing countries their social and economic prospects after recovery from amputation are poor...|$|E
