40|$|The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a {{synoptic}} sky {{survey in}} operation since 2009. PTF utilizes a 7. 1 square degree {{camera on the}} Palomar 48 -inch Schmidt telescope to survey the sky primarily at a single wavelength (R-band) {{at a rate of}} 1000 - 3000 square degrees a night. The data are used to detect and study transient and moving objects such as gamma ray bursts, supernovae and asteroids, as well as variable phenomena such as quasars and Galactic stars. The data processing system at IPAC handles realtime processing and detection of transients, solar system object processing, high photometric precision processing and light curve generation, and long-term archiving and curation. This was developed under an extremely limited budget profile in an unusually agile development environment. Here we discuss the mechanics of this system and our overall development approach. Although a significant <b>scientific</b> <b>installation</b> in of itself, PTF also serves as the prototype for our next generation project, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Beginning operations in 2017, ZTF will feature a 50 square degree camera which will enable scanning of the entire northern visible sky every night.

This report describes the design and instrumentation of the aerogravimetry system, it documents the installation on the aircraft and it discusses some {{of the results of the}} test flights performed within AGFA (Airborne Gravity Flight Approach). Beyond the documentation of the system this report gives a short introduction to the basics of the instruments including a short theory of their operation and data processing. The intention is to give readers from disciplines other than aero-gravimetry and aero-altimetry a technical insight into how the system works and what it is capable of. This should help the reader to evaluate the systems usefulness in other geo-scientific projects. The experiences from the test flights are briefly summarized and an update of the current status and future plans for the individual instruments is given. The aerogravimetry system consists of two major instrument blocks: the gravimetry sensing system and the positioning system. The gravimetry sensors are the LaCoste & Romberg S 124 b and the SAGS- 2. 2 systems. The navigation block holds GPS receivers, an inertial navigation system and a laser altimeter. The aircraft used for the primary tests was a Cessna Grand Caravan of the DLR in Oberpfaffenhofen.

40|$|The {{function}} of the resource allocation sub-model within the IIASA Health Care System model is to simulate how the HCS allocates limited supplies of resources between competing demands. The principal outputs of the sub-model are the numbers of patients treated, in different categories, and the modes and quotas of treatment they receive. The Mark 2 version of the sub-model described in this paper simulates the allocation of many resources within one mode of treatment. It uses the same main assumption as used in the Mark 1 version previously reported; namely that in allocating its resources the HCS attempts to optimise a utility function whose parameters can be inferred from data on past allocations. Depending upon the type of data that is availabledifferent procedures for parameter estimation are required. This paper analyses estimation procedures which use historical allocation data directly.

50|$|The {{telescope}} was finally {{installed in the}} observatory building in July 1922, and the Steward Observatory was officially dedicated on April 23, 1923. In his dedication address, Douglass recounted the trials and tribulations of establishing the observatory, then gave the following eloquent justification for the <b>scientific</b> endeavor:This <b>installation</b> is to be devoted to scientific research. Scientific research is business foresight on a large scale. It is knowledge obtained before it is needed. Knowledge is power, but we cannot tell which fact {{in the domain of}} knowledge is the one which is going to give the power, and we therefore develop the idea of knowledge for its own sake, confident that some one fact or training will pay for all the effort. This I believe is the essence of education wherever such education is not strictly vocational. The student learns many facts and has much training. He can only dimly see which fact and which training will be of eminent use to him, but some special part of his education will take root in him and grow and pay for all of the effort which he and his friends have put into it. So it is with the research institutions. In this Observatory I sincerely hope and expect that the boundaries of human knowledge will be advanced along astronomical lines. Astronomy was the first science developed by our primitive ancestors thousands of years ago because it measured time. Performing that same function, it has played a vast part in human history, and today it is telling us facts, forever wonderful, about the size of our universe; perhaps tomorrow it will give us practical help in showing us how to predict climatic conditions in the future.|$|R

A key aim of the activities was to generate new knowledge in the field of hydrogen safety, and, where possible, use this data as a basis to support the recommendations in the IPG. The structure of the paper mirrors the HYPER research programme in that the work is described in terms of the following relevant scenarios: 1) high pressure releases, 2) small foreseeable releases, 3) catastrophic releases, and 4) the effects of walls and barriers. Within each scenario the key objectives, activities and results are presented. The work on high pressure releases sought to provide information for informing safety distances for high pressure components and associated fuel storage, activities on both ignited and unignited jets are reported.
