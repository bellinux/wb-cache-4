50|$|The engine had two {{double-acting}} cylinders, side-by-side {{and equipped}} with <b>slide-valves,</b> {{and it was}} a simple-expansion type. Drive was transmitted directly by the crankshaft to a rear-mounted differential through using a chain. Owners often modified their Locomobiles by adding third-party accessories, including improved lubricators, condensers, and devices which eased the laborious starting procedure.|$|R
50|$|Model {{steam engines}} {{typically}} use hexamine fuel tablets, methylated spirits (aka meths or denatured alcohol), butane gas, or electricity {{to heat the}} boiler. Cylinders are either oscillating (single-acting or double-acting) or fixed cylinder using <b>slide-valves,</b> piston valves or poppet valves (normally double-acting). Spring safety valves and steam whistles are other common features of model steam engines. Some stationary engines also have feedwater pumps to replenish boiler water, allowing them to run indefinitely as long as sufficient fuel is available.|$|R

50|$|In 1923, engine no. 1620 was {{converted}} to a simplex locomotive in the Salvokop shops in Pretoria by replacing the two <b>slide-valved</b> low-pressure cylinders with piston-valved high-pressure cylinders. Five more, numbers 1621 to 1623, 1631 and 1632, were also converted to simplex locomotives in 1925. Three of these, numbers 1620, 1631 and 1632, were then transferred to East London where more powerful locomotives were needed since the mainline had a heavy gradient of one in forty (2½%) which started {{right at the end}} of the East London departing platform, making it an extremely difficult section. They appear to have not been up to the task in the Eastern Cape, however, since by 1926 they were observed there staged out of service.|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is based on}} the idea of intensifying the gas¿solids contact in a circulating fluidized bed by introducing obstacles into it. Such obstacles may effectively suppress radial inhomogeneities in the solids flux and concentration, increase the dynamic solids hold-up, and break up solids clusters. This article (Part I) deals with the hydrodynamics (pressure drop and solids hold-up) investigated at ambient conditions, for cocurrent upward flow of air and microsize solid particles (FCC, 70 µm diameter) over a regularly structured inert packing introduced into the riser part of a circulating fluidized bed unit. The packed section has a height of 0. 48 m, a cross-sectional area of 0. 06 × 0. 06 m 2 and contains regularly-stacked 0. 01 m diameter Perspex bars as the obstacles meant to enhance the gas¿solids contact. <b>Slide-valves</b> mounted above and below the packed section can be used to trap the solids inventory and determine the (dynamic) solids hold-up. Gas and solids mass fluxes have been varied in the range of 0. 7 < Gg < 4. 4 and O < Gs < 15 kg m- 2 s- 2, respectively. Part II will report on the results of gas¿solids mass transfer measurements, which have been carried out in the same set-up at comparable experimental conditions. Results of this work show that: (i) the pressure gradient over the packed section increases linearly with increasing solids mass flux, but faster than linearly with increasing applied gas mass flux, (ii) the dynamic solids volume fraction can be described quite well by the correlation ß dyn = 0. 0084 GsGg- 1. 22 for almost the entire range of applied gas and solids mass fluxes, (iii) the value for the solids friction factor derived for the gas flux range 0. 7 < Gg < 3. 7 kg (m- 2 s- 1) varies from 1. 4 to 2. 5 and is linear with the solids volume fraction. These fs values are about 2 to 3 decades higher than those obtained from fs correlations derived for dilute-phase pneumatic conveying lines operated under the same experimental conditions...|$|R

5000|$|In 1914, the PRR {{experimentally}} rebuilt D16b #178 in the Altoona Shops, {{giving it}} superheat for greater power and efficiency. This necessitated replacing the <b>slide-valve</b> equipped cylinders, the lubrication {{of which was}} incompatible with the hotter, dryer superheated steam, with piston valves and slightly larger cylinders. Steam pressure was reduced by [...] to [...] Tractive effort increased to 23900 lbf kN from 20600 lbf kN. The rebuilt locomotive was classified D16sb, the [...] "s" [...] referring to superheat.|$|E
50|$|The {{completed}} cloth {{was taken}} by horse and cart and train to finishers for bleaching and dyeing. Around 1910, the hauliers, ex-employees of the mill invested in two steam driven flat bed lorries. These were impounded in 1915 for war work, and horses briefly returned. In April 1913 quotes were sought from William Roberts & Co of Nelson to upgrade the engine, which mainly included replacing the <b>slide-valve</b> cylinders with more efficient Corliss valve cylinders. This work was carried out during the following Wakes Week.|$|E
5000|$|In 1904, the CGR placed {{its last}} two 6th Class bar-framed {{locomotives}} in service, {{built by the}} North British Locomotive Company (NBL). They were experimental and were the first South African locomotives to have piston valves and superheaters. The pistons, with a diameter of 18+1/2 in, were the largest yet used on the 6th Class. The Schmidt superheater was of the smokebox type, but the arrangement was extremely complicated and not very successful. In 1912, they became the Class 6L on the SAR and in 1915, when they were reboilered, the superheaters were removed to convert them to saturated steam locomotives. At {{the same time the}} piston-valve cylinders were replaced with smaller <b>slide-valve</b> cylinders of 17+1/2 in bore.|$|E
5000|$|British {{steeplejack}} {{and engineering}} enthusiast Fred Dibnah {{was known as}} a national institution in Great Britain for the conservation of steam rollers and traction engines. The first engine he restored to working order was an Aveling & Porter steam roller, registration no. DM3079. Built in 1912, it was a 10-ton <b>slide-valve,</b> single-cylinder, 4-shaft, road roller. Originally named [...] "Allison", after his first wife, Fred renamed the engine [...] "Betsy" [...] (his mother's name) following his divorce - Fred's view being [...] "wives may change but your mother remains your mother!" [...] This roller was featured in many of Fred's early television programmes. It may still be seen at steam rallies in Britain and was in steam at the Great Dorset Steam Fair in 2011.|$|E
50|$|The {{superheater}} {{arrangement was}} extremely complicated {{and did not}} {{prove to be a}} success. The two engines were comparatively tested against two similar saturated steam locomotives, but did not achieve any appreciable economy. The piston valves were found to be too small in diameter and the additional complications in boiler and smokebox details led to the decision in 1915 to reboiler the two locomotives with boilers similar to those used by the standard Class 6 locomotive, thus converting them to saturated steam locomotives. The piston-valve cylinders were also removed and replaced with smaller 17+1/2 in bore <b>slide-valve</b> cylinders. In this form, the locomotives were practically identical to the bar-framed Class 6J locomotives which had been built by Neilson, Reid and Company in 1902, except that they still had cylinders with a 1/2 in larger bore.|$|E
5000|$|The Honda CB175 was a {{standard}} motorcycle made by Honda from 1969 to 1973. It had a [...] four-stroke, parallel twin engine {{with a single}} overhead camshaft, two valves per cylinder, dual <b>slide-valve</b> carburetors, and dual exhausts. It was also equipped with a five-speed gearbox, 12-volt electrics, kick and electric start, front and rear drum brakes, turn signals, speedometer with trip meter (1972 and later models), and tachometer, and was rated at [...] An update in 1972 brought a more rounded gas tank and changes to the air box covers, along with some other minor trim changes. The CB175 was discontinued for 1974 and replaced by the CB200, a similar bike already in production. Although not technologically remarkable, Honda's small twins of the 1960s and 1970s were among their best sellers. Dual sport scrambler CL175 and touring CD175/CA175 versions were also produced.|$|E
5000|$|Just {{one year}} later in US patent 49346, he has {{returned}} to more conventional design but still sought to address the deficiencies of the current gas engine, this time identified as the spark ignition system which is blamed for [...] "stoppages of the engine which are incompatible with the regularity and uniformity of action of motive power necessary for industrial or manufacturing purposes". This patent records the essential ideas that are {{the basis of his}} commercial engine, the key one being the use of a modified slide valve to allow a flame to ignite the mixture rather than a spark. This same principle was patented by William Barnett in 1838, but Barnett used a rotating cock rather than a <b>slide-valve</b> mechanism. The other novel feature is the use of small quantities of water injected into the cylinder to control temperature.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{ever-increasing}} {{power demands}} of the 1800s, especially in manufacturing, innovations were made to existing steam engines {{and a number of}} entirely new steam engines were developed. Of these, few brought the high levels of horsepower and efficiency produced by the Corliss engine. [...] Named after its inventor, George Henry Corliss, this stationary steam engine was introduced to the world in 1849. The engine boasted a number of desired features, including fuel efficiency (lowering cost of fuel by a third or more), low maintenance costs, 30% higher rate of power production, high thermal efficiency, and the ability to operate under light, heavy, or varying loads while maintaining high velocity and constant speed. While the engine was loosely based on existing steam engines keeping the simple piston-flywheel design, the majority of these features were brought about by the engine’s unique valves and valve gears. Unlike most engines employed during the era that were using mainly <b>slide-valve</b> gears, Corliss created his own system that used a wrist plate to control a number of different valves. Each cylinder was equipped with four valves, with exhaust and inlet valves {{at both ends of the}} cylinder. Through a precisely tuned series of events opening and closing these valves, steam is admitted and released at a precise rate allowing for linear piston motion. This provided the engine’s most notable feature, the automatic variable cut-off mechanism. [...] This mechanism is what allowed the engine to function under varying loads without losing efficiency, stalling, or being damaged. Using a series of cam gears, which could adjust valve timing (essentially acting as a throttle), the engine’s speed and horsepower was adjusted. This proved extremely useful for most of the engine’s applications. In the textile industry, it allowed for production at much higher speeds while lowering the likelihood that threads would break. [...] In metallurgy, the extreme and abrupt variations of load experienced in rolling mills were also countered by the technology. These examples demonstrate that the Corliss engine was able to lead to much higher rates of production, while preventing costly damages to machinery and materials. It was referred to as “the most perfect regulation of speed.” ...|$|E
