500|$|In mid-2003, MCA Records {{was absorbed}} by Universal Music Group label Geffen Records, which {{resulted}} in MCA's staff and roster being moved to Geffen. At the time, guitarist Josh Partington said: [...] " [...] can't worry {{about things that are}} out of your control ... I can't do anything about it <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> keep doing what you're doing." [...] On July 12, 2003, North was announced for release. From mid-July to late August, the band supported 311 on their tour of the US. [...] "Space" [...] was released as a single on September 8, and released to modern rock radio a day later. A music video for the song was premiered by Fox Broadcasting Company on September 16. The video was filmed in August during the band's tour with 311 by director Mike Piscitelli. It featured five pillars, all of them fitted with video monitors, placed in various locations within Los Angeles, such as in an alleyway or at a bus stop. In September, the band supported Good Charlotte on their arena tour of the US.|$|E
500|$|After graduating, Hedlund {{signed with}} the Trenton Titans of the East Coast Hockey League for the final games of the 2001–02 season. He played in two games as a rookie and did not record a stat during the regular season, but in six playoff games he spent six minutes in the penalty box. In the 2002–03 season, he played in 13 games for Trenton {{recording}} a goal and two assists before he was called up to the American Hockey League's Binghamton Senators. In Binghamton, he played in 59 games scoring one goal and adding seven assists. On January 16, 2004, against the Albany River Rats, Hedlund broke a 17-game streak {{in which he had}} gone scoreless after he recorded his first career overtime goal and his second career game-winner. His previous goal was a game-winning shot against Syracuse. He ended the 2003–04 season with four goals and 19 assists in 80 games. Before the 2004–05 season, Hedlund spent time in training camp with the Ottawa Senators before he was reassigned to Binghamton. The NHL season would eventually be locked out which saw players such as goaltender Dominik Hašek join the AHL. When Hasek began working out with Binghamton, Hedlund commented, [...] "He's just one of the guys when he's here, he just wants to put in his time and get some good work in, and make sure he's ready to go, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> got to appreciate a guy like that being here and doing that kind of work, so its pretty fun." [...] A season preview produced by the website Hockey's Future commented about Hedlund saying that, [...] "A fan-favorite, Hedlund gives it everything he has despite limited talent." [...] Against the Manitoba Moose on October 31, Hedlund scored a goal from the blue line that tied the game, however the Senators ended up losing 5–3. Following the season, he and Philadelphia Phantoms player Ben Stafford were named the AHL's Men of the Year. During the season he played in 75 games, scoring two goals with 13 assists. In the playoffs, he played in six games recording two assists.|$|E

[...] "The first time I played in a really large concert with Lenny was at an outdoor festival called Pinkpop. We played for like 70,000 people. It was in the summer so most people had just t-shirts or tanks, {{a lot of guys}} had their shirts off, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> see skin and hands and they're doing this wave thing. I almost lost it, my equilibrium was teetering. I wasn't used to seeing that many people; I was disoriented; I just had to stop looking and start focusing." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked if}} she would return in 2004, Benjamin said, [...] "I loved Lisa. She was a great {{character}} and I loved playing all those story lines. It was a wonderful opportunity for me but all that angst and that drama can sometimes get to you. She hasn't been killed off. Loads of characters are revived and brought back but I don't know if it's something I'd want to do again at the moment. It still feels like only yesterday I was there and it's good to kind of recharge your batteries and {{get out there and}} do other things. But I love the show and I’d never say never! And I liked playing Lisa. I thought she was a great character <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> don’t know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Newhart {{discontinued}} {{the series}} in 1978 after six seasons and 142 episodes. Wallace said of its ending, [...] "It was much crying and sobbing. It was so sad. We really did get along. We really had great times together." [...] Of Newhart's other long-running sitcom, Newhart, Wallace said, [...] "But {{some of the}} other great comedic talents who had a brilliant show, when they tried to do it twice, it didn't always work. And that's what... but like Bob, as far as I'm concerned, Bob is like the Fred Astaire of comics. He just makes it look so easy, and he's not as in-your-face as some might be. And <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> kind of take it for granted, how extraordinarily funny and how he wears well." [...] She was later reunited with Newhart twice, once in a reprise of her role as Carol on Murphy Brown in 1994, and on an episode of Newhart's short-lived sitcom, George & Leo, in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of 2005, the group convened in a collaboration with Castle Music to decide on songs for a retrospective. Juggernaut Rides '89–'98 compiled 33 tracks remastered from the original DATs (almost half of which being non-album tracks) and was released on 14 March 2005. The two-CD anthology featured four previously unreleased songs, including Shake Appeal's [...] "Son of Mustang Ford" [...] demo from 1989 and the remainder of Swervedriver's 1998 recordings, [...] "Just Sometimes" [...] and the orchestral string accompanied [...] "Neon Lights Glow". Regarding the production effort for Juggernaut Rides, Franklin told Tape Op magazine, [...] "Me and Jimmy sat there [...] and said, 'Wow this is pretty great.' You do forget things about the various tracks," [...] and said to Australia's The Vine, [...] "I quite {{like the fact that}} it’s not chronologically laid out, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> jump straight into the middle." [...] Reviews touted it as [...] "Swervedriver's beautiful corpse" [...] and asserted that it [...] "proves they were so much more than just another underachieving T-shirt band." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay" [...] was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. On February 10, 2013, whilst walking the red carpet of the 55th Grammy Awards, Rihanna held an interview with Ryan Seacrest who officially revealed that the music video would premiere on E! News the following day. Rihanna described the production saying, [...] "The video was really, really simple. I pretty much stayed put in a bathtub, and we shot it really tight, really close. There's Mikky Ekko in the video as well. This {{is the first time}} I've ever collaborated with him, so I'm excited about that because he's actually the one who wrote the song and I kinda just {{fell in love with it}} so much and in love with the tone of his voice and we wanna keep him a part of it, so you'll see him in the video." [...] The singer added, [...] "It's a very emotional song and it's personal, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> think about, it's almost like telling a story, and when you tell a story, even to yourself — if you're saying it out loud and expressing how you feel — it needs to be powerful because it needs to be authentic." [...] On February 11, Rihanna leaked an [...] "uncut" [...] version of the video on Twitter prior to the official premiere, featuring the singer performing to the track in one singular take, without Mikky Ekko. The official version premiered on E! News later that day. It was then uploaded to Rihanna's official VEVO account at 8AM ET the following day. Shortly after the video was uploaded, it was flagged by YouTube for its sexual content. The flag has since been removed.|$|E
2500|$|What ensued {{was one of}} {{the most}} vitriolic {{corporate}} battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: [...] "My question is: Why haven't we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It's like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it. At GM, if you see a snake, the first thing you do is go hire a consultant on snakes. Then you get a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. You figure, the snake hasn't bitten anybody yet, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> let him crawl around on the factory floor. We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor". Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot's frequent criticism of GM's executive perks a year earlier, [...] "Perot's office (in Dallas) 'makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs around saying 'Get rid of Ross's office'".|$|E
