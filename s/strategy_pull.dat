Rather than relying on music companies or a DJ to pre-determine the mix of songs on a CD, an increasing number of music listeners are downloading individual tracks and assembling their own sequence of songs. This process is also being replicated with the creation of playlists through platforms such as iTunes, Spotify and Last FM. Fan-built playlists and mixes are taking over the way people get their music. Playlists are inevitably becoming a pull marketing resource that marketing alliances must embrace, due to their ability to be shared via Peer to peer networks. People are choosing {{what they want to hear}} rather than having it pushed on them.|$|E

[...] The choice of a push or <b>pull</b> <b>strategy</b> has important implications for advertising and promotion. In a push strategy the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions and trade shows while a <b>pull</b> <b>strategy</b> would make more extensive use of consumer-oriented media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Distributed systems benefit {{substantially}} {{from the}} ability to exchange jobs between temporarily heavily and lightly loaded nodes. Depending on whether the lightly or heavily loaded nodes initiate the job exchange, such <b>strategies</b> are termed <b>pull</b> or push <b>strategies.</b> In this paper we compare the performance of an aggressive push strategy with the more traditional <b>pull</b> <b>strategies</b> in large distributed systems using mean field models. We consider homogeneous systems, systems with fast and slow servers as well as master-worker setups. We show that even at high loads the aggressive push strategy can outperform traditional <b>pull</b> <b>strategies</b> in a homogeneous system (at the expense of increased network traffic), while the <b>pull</b> <b>strategies</b> are superior in a master-worker setup where the proportion of masters is low.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we compare the {{performance}} of the <b>pull</b> and push <b>strategy</b> in a large homogeneous distributed system. When a <b>pull</b> <b>strategy</b> is in use, lightly loaded nodes attempt to steal jobs from more highly loaded nodes, while under the push strategy more highly loaded nodes look for lightly loaded nodes to process some of their jobs. Given the maximum allowed overall probe rate R and arrival rate λ, we provide closed form solutions for the mean response time of a job for the push and <b>pull</b> <b>strategy</b> under the infinite system model. More specifically, we show that the push <b>strategy</b> outperforms the <b>pull</b> <b>strategy</b> for any probe rate R> 0 when λ < φ − 1, where φ = (1 + √ 5) / 2 ≈ 1. 6180 is the golden ratio. More generally, we show that the push strategy prevails if and only if 2 λ < √ (R + 1) 2 + 4 (R + 1) −(R+ 1). We also show that under the infinite system model, a hybrid <b>pull</b> and push <b>strategy</b> is always inferior to the pure <b>pull</b> or push <b>strategy.</b> The relation between the finite and infinite system model is discussed and simulation results that validate the infinite system model are provided.

We first study the unique best arm setting when there exists one unique best arm. Second, we study the general switching best arm setting when a best arm switches at some unknown steps. For both settings, we target problem-dependent bounds, instead of the more conservative problem-free bounds. We consider two classical problems: (1) identify a best arm with high probability (best arm identification), for which the performance measure by the sample complexity (number of samples before finding a near-optimal arm). To this end, we naturally extend the definition of sample complexity so that it makes sense in the switching best arm setting, which may be of independent interest.

40|$|Membership {{rates of}} {{alternative}} unions that offer individual juridical guidance and assistance but rarely contribute to collective bargaining are increasing in Denmark. Conversely, the overall membership rates of traditional unions that negotiate collective agreements are decreasing. This means that local shop stewards often face a mixed environment {{of workers in}} traditional unions and workers in alternative unions at the individual workplace. Surveys have indicated that shop stewards split into two groups when dealing with non-members at the workplace. Half of them choose to represent non-members (<b>pull</b> <b>strategy),</b> whereas the other half choose not to (push strategy). This article presents an explorative case study of the recruitment and retention strategies used by two shop stewards in two different companies with significant groups of alternatively organized workers. A case with sector-level wage setting and a case with local-level wage setting within the manufacturing sector are compared. Results suggest that shop stewards in both types of settings tend to combine push and <b>pull</b> <b>strategies,</b> because they serve different purposes. Push strategies help retain existing members of the traditional unions, whereas <b>pull</b> <b>strategies</b> are necessary to recruit new members.
