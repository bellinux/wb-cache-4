5|$|These defeats {{forced the}} Galatians to <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> {{peace and the}} Romans {{returned}} to the coast of Asia Minor. However, when Manlius Vulso returned to Rome, {{he was charged with}} threatening the peace between the Seleucids and Rome. He was cleared and was granted a triumph by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) {{is angry}} that {{the club is}} now {{stronger}} than ever, and punishes Quinn and Santana. Quinn retaliates by thanking <b>Sue</b> <b>for</b> helping her realize that believing in herself negates the need to bring other people down. Will realizes that his passion is teaching, not performing, and resolves to recommit to the glee club.|$|E
5|$|John Kinnamos {{wrote of}} a second {{campaign}} by Stephen against the Byzantine Empire. The Hungarian troops, supported by Czech reinforcements {{under the command of}} Duke Vaclav of Olomouc, took Braničevo by storm and destroyed its fortress. Emperor John II Komnenos was forced to retreat and <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace. Historian Ferenc Makk writes that the resulting peace treaty was signed in October 1129.|$|E

50|$|As a result, John <b>sued</b> Andrew <b>for</b> {{damages for}} this assault. As section 5 of the Accident Compensation Act 1972 prohibits <b>suing</b> <b>for</b> damages for {{physical}} injury, John <b>sued</b> <b>for</b> exemplary damages for the hammer attack.|$|R
5000|$|Mow Fung {{had been}} <b>sued</b> <b>for</b> occasions. In 1925 he was <b>sued</b> <b>for</b> wrongfully {{quarrying}} and removing granite {{from a group}} of Chinese contractors' land at Kowloon City. In 1948 he was <b>sued</b> <b>for</b> a transaction of property during the wartime.|$|R
5|$|These two {{crushing}} military defeats {{forced the}} Galatians to <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace. This campaign greatly enriched Vulso and his legions as the Galatians had gathered great wealth through their many conquests in Asia Minor. The Galatians sent envoys to Vulso asking for peace but Vulso, {{who at the}} time was hurrying back to Ephesus because winter was approaching, bade them to come to Ephesus.|$|E
5|$|After {{having won}} {{control of the}} seas, a Roman force landed on the African coast under Marcus Regulus, who was at first victorious, winning the Battle of Adys and forcing Carthage to <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace. However, the terms of peace that Rome {{proposed}} were so heavy that negotiations failed, and in response, the Carthaginians hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a mercenary from the martial Greek city-state of Sparta, to reorganise and lead their army. Xanthippus managed {{to cut off the}} Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy and then defeated and captured Regulus at the Battle of Tunis.|$|E
5|$|At the Lannister army camp, Lord Tywin Lannister and his {{followers}} discuss their recent setbacks: not only have they lost an important battle, and Jaime, to the Starks, along with his entire army, but both Baratheon brothers now also threaten them. Because his grandson's execution of Ned Stark destroyed any hope to <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace between the Starks and the Lannisters, Tywin orders his son Tyrion to go to King's Landing in his stead as Hand of the King {{in order to keep}} Joffrey under control. Against his father's orders, Tyrion brings the prostitute Shae with him to the capital.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} King Poniatowski decided to <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace, the Polish army {{was still in}} good {{fighting}} condition, not suffering from any major defeat nor from lack of supplies. King Poniatowski thought that due to Russian numerical superiority defeat was nonetheless imminent, and more could be gained through negotiations with the Russians, with whom he hoped a new alliance could be formed. Although subsequent events would prove him wrong, {{the question of whether}} this could have been foreseen, and prevented through continued military resistance, has been subject to much debate among historians.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius {{was long}} remembered favourably in the Western church for his reputed feat in {{recovering}} the True Cross, {{which had been}} captured by the Persians. As Heraclius approached the capital, Khosrau fled from his favourite residence, Dastagird near Baghdad, without offering resistance. Meanwhile, some of the Persian grandees freed Khosrau's eldest son Kavadh II, who had been imprisoned by his father, and proclaimed him King {{on the night of}} 23–24 February, 628. Kavadh however was mortally ill and was anxious that Heraclius should protect his infant son Ardeshir. So, as a goodwill gesture, he sent the True Cross with a negotiator to <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace in 628.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} federal government to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. In 1957, Congress passed the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction: the Civil Rights Act of 1957. This legislation authorized the Attorney General to <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> injunctive relief on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth Amendment rights were deprived, created the Civil Rights Division within the Department of Justice to enforce civil rights through litigation, and created the Commission on Civil Rights to investigate voting rights deprivations. Further protections were enacted in the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.|$|E

5|$|Multiple Aboriginal {{villages in}} {{frontier}} areas rebelled against the Dutch in the 1650s due to oppression {{such as when}} the Dutch ordered aboriginal women for sex, deer pelts, and rice be given to them from aborigines in the Taipei basin in Wu-lao-wan village which sparked a rebellion in December 1652 {{at the same time}} as the Chinese rebellion. Two Dutch translators were beheaded by the Wu-lao-wan aborigines and in a subsequent fight 30 aboriginals and another two Dutch people died, after an embargo of salt and iron on Wu-lao-wan the aboriginals were forced to <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace in February 1653.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeals {{held that}} Blacksmith could {{independently}} bring the claim for trespass, {{for which he}} need only show a right to possession. The Court of Appeals also held that Fellows' title was invalid, because the payment of compensation was a condition precedent. Welles, in dissent, agreed that Blacksmith could individually <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> trespass, but disagreed that the appraisal was a condition precedent; he would have reversed and granted a new trial, with costs. The Court of Appeals remanded back to the Supreme Court, after which a writ of error was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|The Jin assault {{commenced}} in mid December 1126. Even as fighting raged on, Qinzong {{continued to}} <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace, but Jin demands for territory were enormous: they wanted all provinces {{north of the}} Yellow River. After more than twenty days of heavy combat against the besieging forces, Song defenses were decimated and the morale of Song soldiers was on the decline. On January 9, 1127, the Jurchens broke through and started to loot the conquered city. Emperor Qinzong tried to appease the victors by offering the remaining wealth of the capital. The royal treasury was emptied and the belongings of the city's residents were seized. The Song emperor offered his unconditional surrender a few days later.|$|E

5|$|The Second Samnite War, from 327 BC to 304 BC, {{was much}} {{longer and more}} serious for both the Romans and Samnites. The {{fortunes}} of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course. But the Romans won the Battle of Bovianum, and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC, the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies.|$|E
5|$|The police {{continued}} the investigation, {{under pressure to}} finish quickly. Two reconstructions of the murder were conducted, drawing hundreds of spectators. One was done with Sumaji {{playing the role of}} the murderer, without his lawyers' knowledge; when the counsel found out, they removed him from the reconstruction. Eventually, police agreed to a deal with the counsel, in which Sumaji's pre-trial release was guaranteed in exchange for a promise from his lawyers to not <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> wrongful arrest. Sumaji was released on 17 December, awaiting trial. In early 1997, Sumaji's case was refused by the prosecutor's office several times due to weak evidence.|$|E
5|$|While the Persians proved largely {{successful}} {{during the}} first stage of the war from 602 to 622, conquering much of the Levant, Egypt, several islands in the Aegean Sea and parts of Anatolia, the ascendancy of emperor Heraclius in 610 led, despite initial setbacks, to a Status quo ante bellum. Heraclius' campaigns in Persian lands from 622 to 626 forced the Persians onto the defensive, allowing his forces to regain momentum. Allied with the Avars and Slavs, the Persians made a final attempt to take Constantinople in 626, but were defeated there. In 627 Heraclius invaded the heartland of the Persians and forced them to <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace.|$|E

5|$|After {{six months}} of siege the Dutch had re-opened the sea lanes. Charles now faced a {{difficult}} choice: {{if he tried to}} <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace, the conditions would have been worse than the previous peace. The other option was an all-out attack on Copenhagen, hoping that conquering the city would end the war. The number of Swedish attackers are somewhat uncertain, roughly 8,000 men, comprising 4,500 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, 1,000 sailors and a few hundred gunners. The king planned the attack meticulously, but neglected to uphold adequate secrecy; the Danes were soon fully aware of the details of the Swedish attack plan thanks to a number of deserters and spies able to move between the encampments. The Danes had 6,000 trained soldiers, and an additional 5,000 men and women from the city had also taken up weapons, bringing the number of defenders to 11,000.|$|E
5|$|As a Klingon moon, Praxis, explodes without warning, the {{starship}} USS Excelsior, commanded by Captain Hikaru Sulu, {{is struck by}} the shock wave and its crew discovers {{that much of the}} moon has been obliterated. The loss of their key energy production facility and the destruction of the Klingon homeworld's ozone layer throws the Klingon Empire into turmoil. No longer able to maintain a hostile footing, the Klingons <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace with their longstanding enemy, the United Federation of Planets. Accepting the proposal before the Klingons revert to a more belligerent approach, Starfleet sends the USS Enterprise-A to meet with the Klingon Chancellor, Gorkon, and escort him to negotiations on Earth. Enterprises captain, James T. Kirk, whose son David was murdered by Klingons years earlier, opposes the negotiations and resents his assignment.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2008, when Warner Bros. took pitches from comic book writers, screenwriters and directors, opting to reboot the franchise. In 2009, a court ruling {{resulted}} in Jerry Siegel's family recapturing {{the rights to}} Superman's origins and Siegel's copyright. The decision stated that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films, but {{if they did not}} begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Shuster and Siegel estates would be able to <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> lost revenue on an unproduced film. Producer Christopher Nolan pitched Goyer's idea after story discussion on The Dark Knight Rises, and Snyder was hired as the film's director in October 2010. Principal photography began in August 2011 in West Chicago, Illinois, before moving to Vancouver and Plano, Illinois.|$|E
