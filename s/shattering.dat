5000|$|<b>Shatter</b> {{is a type}} of {{cannabis}} concentrate, <b>shatter</b> specifically {{refers to}} a texture of concentrate that breaks and <b>shatters</b> like glass, rather than pulling like taffy. It is created by extracting the cannabinoids, terpenes, and other chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant usually from dried cannabis. <b>Shatter</b> is similar to Live resin, but instead Live resin uses fresh cannabis and is extracted differently than <b>Shatter.</b> A wide variety of solvents can be used for extraction, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, petroleum ether, naphtha, benzene, butane, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and olive oil. <b>Shatter</b> is usually transparent and has an amber glass color. The reason <b>shatter</b> is clear {{has to do with the}} molecules in the cannabis. If this molecules are left undisturbed, they form the glass-like appearance. Heat, moisture, and high terpene content can also affect the texture of the outcome of the extraction, which may turn oils into a runnier substance that resembles sap. Oils with a consistency that falls somewhere between clear <b>shatter</b> and viscous sap is often referred to as [...] "pull-and-snap".|$|R

5|$|The {{fruit that}} {{develops}} is a schizocarp {{consisting of two}} mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed. The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry.

The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs. The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning. Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals. Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.|$|E
