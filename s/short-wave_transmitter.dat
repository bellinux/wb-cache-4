50|$|In the 1930s Italy {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{countries}} to begin international shortwave broadcasts. Guglielmo Marconi, the man who invented radio, oversaw the construction of the first <b>short-wave</b> <b>transmitter</b> at Prato Smeraldo outside Rome on July 1, 1930. Four years later two more transmitters were completed and broadcasts began in English and Italian to North America. In 1935 broadcasting of programmes in Italian, Portuguese and Spanish began to South America.|$|E

50|$|Since Soviet <b>short-wave</b> <b>transmitters</b> were {{extensively}} used {{to broadcast}} messages to clandestine agents, the transmissions consisting simply of number sequences read aloud and decoded using a one-time pad, it was {{realized that this}} new technique {{could be used to}} track down such agents. Specially equipped aircraft would fly over urban areas at times when the Soviets were transmitting, and attempt to locate receivers tuned to the Soviet transmissions.|$|R
50|$|Radio Nepal (रेडियो नेपाल) is the {{state-owned}} Radio broadcasting organisation of Nepal, {{which was established}} on 2 April 1951. Initially, the transmission lasted for 4 hours and 30 minutes through a 250-watt <b>short-wave</b> <b>transmitter.</b> Over the years, Radio Nepal has strengthened its institutional capacity considerably and diversified itself in terms of programme format, technical efficiency and coverage. Radio Nepal airs programmes on short wave medium wave (AM) and FM frequencies.|$|E
50|$|The Zeesen <b>short-wave</b> <b>transmitter</b> was a 70-metre-high shortwave radio {{transmission}} mast constructed at Zeesen in Germany in 1931. Consisting of a lattice tower of pitch pine timbers, {{it was one}} of Germany's first short-wave broadcasting transmitters. It was equipped with four transmitting arms, at 90-degree separation, surmounted by two omnidirectional aerials. In 1939, the wooden tower was replaced by a 70-metre high steel mast with a single omnidirectional aerial. This mast was dismantled, together with all the Zeesen transmitters, in 1945.|$|E
50|$|The Research Laboratories {{continued}} {{with the development}} of new transmitters that could operate at shorter wavelengths and could be re-tuned for broadcasts to different parts of the world. By the end of 1936, the power had been raised by connecting a stage with two water-cooled type TA 20/250 valves. This provided a power output of 60 kW at a frequency of 15220 kHz and immediately became the strongest <b>short-wave</b> <b>transmitter</b> in Europe. In 1937, this transmitter was moved from Eindhoven to the PHOHI Transmitter Park in Huizen.|$|E

Its studios {{are located in}} Miami, Florida. Cuba jams both the medium-wave and shortwave signals, but the shortwave program is heard in Canada and throughout Central America and South America. On occasion, the medium-wave transmitter at 1180 kHz can be heard {{as far north as}} Washington, D.C.|$|R
50|$|In 1926, being a student, {{he joined}} the Central Radio Laboratory (CRL) of the National Trust of {{electrical}} plants of the weak current.

5000|$|The Zeesen {{transmitter}} comprised a 280 metre {{long and}} 12 metre wide T-antenna spun between two guyed 210 metre tall masts, which were 450 metres apart from each other. It was connected {{directly with the}} transmitter which was housed in a building {{in the middle of}} the two masts. Until 1928 Deutschlandsender II used the frequency 240 kHz. Afterwards its frequency was 183.5 kHz and, after 1934, 191 kHz. Its transmission power initially was 35 kilowatt, in 1931 it was increased to 60 kilowatt.

50|$|In 1935 Watt {{was asked}} to comment on reports of a German death ray based on radio. Watt and his {{assistant}} Arnold Frederic Wilkins quickly determined it was not possible, but Wilkins suggested using radio signals to locate aircraft at long distances. This led to a February 1935 demonstration where signals from a BBC <b>short-wave</b> <b>transmitter</b> were bounced off a Handley Page Heyford aircraft. Watt led {{the development of a}} practical version of this device, which entered service in 1938 under the code name Chain Home. This system provided the vital advance information that helped the Royal Air Force win the Battle of Britain.|$|E
50|$|The 189-acre {{site was}} {{acquired}} by the BBC in November 1939 and the station, known as Overseas Extension 3 (OSE3), was equipped with four Marconi type SWB 18, 100 kW <b>short-wave</b> <b>transmitters.</b> The transmitter halls, each containing a pair of these transmitters, were separated by heavy blast walls. A comprehensive aerial system was installed consisting of 29 arrays supported between 15 masts of heights varying between l00 ft and 325 ft. Full world coverage was given by this aerial system, although the transmissions were primarily intended for areas outside Europe. This {{was the first of}} the BBC's short-wave stations to be provided with 4-wire transmission lines, following tests made at Daventry (OSE1). A remotely controlled switching tower was used for connecting any transmitter to any aerial array (antenna).|$|R

5000|$|Gunnar Nygaard (24 December 1897 [...] - [...] 25 January 1997) was a Norwegian {{broadcasting}} pioneer. He {{was born}} in Kristiania. He was educated in telegraphy, and {{a pioneer in the}} technical development of broadcasting in Norway. He took part in the first experimental broadcasting from Tryvasshøgda, starting in 1923. From 1933 he worked for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. During the German occupation of Norway Nygaard established and operated a Norwegian <b>short-wave</b> <b>transmitter</b> in the United States, in particular targeting Norwegian sailors. Back in Norway he established a short-wave radio for seamen, which opened in Fredrikstad in 1948. He was awarded the St. Olav Medal in 1964.|$|E
50|$|Several new {{technical}} solutions {{were implemented}} during {{the construction of}} the TV Tower. The reinforced-concrete tower itself was assembled using the sliding mold method. The concrete mold was installed at a height of 2.5 metres, then the armature was inserted and the concrete was poured. After that the concrete form was shifted upwards, narrowed to the new diameter value and the new section of reinforced concrete was created. Today you can still see the rings resulting from this concreting process at 2.5 metre intervals on the tower. The concrete was poured continuously for 8 months, with the tower gradually rising above the landscape. The builders used the M-400 concrete based on oil shale ash and Portland cement. This concrete had been developed by the scientists at the Tallinn Polytechnical Institute under the supervision of Professor Verner Kikas. The concrete was designed to withstand 300 frost resistance cycles. Subsequent inspections have revealed that the strength of this concrete is even higher than stipulated.The antenna part of the structure is made from steel cylinders. The metal antenna was installed using the ejection method. At first a smaller-diameter cylinder was lifted to the necessary spot, then over it was placed a larger-diameter cylinder and the smaller cylinder was pushed up through it with blocks and winches. The assembly was completed by attaching to each cylinder the television and ultra <b>short-wave</b> <b>transmitter</b> vibrators.The upper metal framework weighing over 120 tons was assembled on the ground {{around the base of the}} tower and then raised to 170 metres. From start to finish all building work was supervised by foreman Aleksander Ehala and team master Väino Saar. They often had to solve extremely complicated problems and the designers always agreed with their solutions.The TV Tower is a sophisticated structure and it is therefore regularly checked for geodetic compliance: foundation settling, vertical deviation, condition of reinforced concrete and metal components, other parameters of the tower. The allowed swerve of the top of the TV Tower due to wind is 1.5 metres, of the viewing platform - 90 cm. Besides winds, the tower is affected by solar heat, resulting in the top “drawing” a peculiar curve. The steel part, from 190 m to 260 m, has a lift for two persons and hatches for access to the external platforms for the purpose of inspection and repairs of the antenna equipment. In the tower below the antenna section there is also a staircase with 1,050 steps, all the way from the basement to a height of 190 metres.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a unique "natural experiment" of the operation and cessation of a broadcast <b>transmitter</b> with its <b>short-wave</b> electromagnetic fields (6 - 22 MHz) on sleep quality and melatonin cycle in a general human population sample. In 1998, 54 volunteers (21 men, 33 women) were followed for 1 week each before and after shut-down of the <b>short-wave</b> radio <b>transmitter</b> at Schwarzenburg (Switzerland). Salivary melatonin was sampled five times a day and total daily excretion and acrophase were estimated using complex cosinor analysis. Sleep quality was recorded daily using a visual analogue scale. Before shut down, self-rated sleep quality was reduced by 3. 9 units (95 % CI: 1. 7 - 6. 0) per mA/m increase in magnetic field exposure. The corresponding decrease in melatonin excretion was 10 % (95 % CI: - 32 to 20 %). After shutdown, sleep quality improved by 1. 7 units (95 % CI: 0. 1 - 3. 4) per mA/m decrease in magnetic field exposure. Melatonin excretion increased by 15 % (95 % CI: - 3 to 36 %) compared to baseline values suggesting a rebound effect. Stratified analyses showed an exposure effect on melatonin excretion in poor sleepers (26 % increase; 95 % CI: 8 - 47 %) but not in good sleepers. Change in sleep quality and melatonin excretion was related to the extent of magnetic field reduction after the transmitter's shut down in poor but not good sleepers. However, blinding of exposure was not possible in this observational study and this may have affected the outcome measurements in a direct or indirect (psychological) way...|$|R
