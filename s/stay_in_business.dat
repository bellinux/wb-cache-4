5|$|As {{popular as}} their {{cartoons}} were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios {{to go out}} of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry out of work. Hanna–Barbera was key in the development of limited animation, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but also reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques {{in the early days of}} Tom and Jerry. To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation. The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Reviewers criticized the change from vivid, detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna–Barbera to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>business,</b> providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work. Limited animation became the standard for television animation, and continues to be used today in television programs such as The Simpsons and South Park.|$|E

25|$|Airlines use futures {{contracts}} and derivatives to hedge {{their exposure to}} the price of jet fuel. They know that they must purchase jet fuel {{for as long as they}} want to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>business,</b> and fuel prices are notoriously volatile. By using crude oil futures contracts to hedge their fuel requirements (and engaging in similar but more complex derivatives transactions), Southwest Airlines was able to save a large amount of money when buying fuel as compared to rival airlines when fuel prices in the U.S. rose dramatically after the 2003 Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
25|$|On 1 November 2009, {{all three}} of the McDonald's in Iceland closed, {{primarily}} due to the chain's high cost of importing most of the chain's meat and vegetables, by McDonald's demands and standards, from the Eurozone. At the time, a Big Mac in Iceland cost 650 krona ($5.29), and the 20% price increase that would have been needed to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>business</b> would have increased that cost to 780 krona ($6.36). Fish, lamb and beef meat is produced in Iceland, while beef is often imported (but also exported).|$|E

Only a reincorporation saved Wonderland for another season (after an infusion of new investments, and {{an expansion of the}} park's facilities, the park in eastern Indianapolis managed to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>business</b> until it was destroyed by fire in 1911).|$|E

He disputed some of the allegations of deceptive business practices, noting he had given refunds when products were not compatible with the British electrical system.

Special dispensation {{was given to the}} circus by President Roosevelt to use the rails to operate in 1942, in spite of travel restrictions imposed as a result of World WarII. Many of the most famous images from the circus that were published in magazine and posters were captured by American Photographer Maxwell Frederic Coplan, who traveled the world with the circus, capturing its beauty as well as its harsh realities.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{newspapers}} depend a {{great deal}} on governmental advertising; without such revenues, {{it would be difficult for}} many Indian newspapers to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>business.</b> Unfortunately, this has kept many of them vulnerable to government manipulation. The large-scale possibility of such manipulation, however, was not fully demonstrated until Indira Gandhi's government decided to take advantage of this unique circumstance. In the beginning of censorship, when a few leading newspapers such as The Indian Express and The Statesman refused to abide the governmental censorship, the government withdrew its advertising support from these newspapers. Later on, this type of financial castigation was used on several other rebellious newspapers.|$|E

Farmers in the area sometimes traded food {{in exchange for his}} toys; Ole Kirk continued producing practical furniture in addition to toys to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>business.</b> In the mid-1930s, the yo-yo toy fad gave him a brief period of increased activity until it suddenly collapsed. To reduce waste, Ole Kirk used the leftover yo-yo parts as wheels for toy trucks. His son Godtfred began working for him, taking {{an active role in the}} company.|$|E
25|$|Rhodes {{retained}} {{effective control}} of the BSAC {{until his death in}} 1902, but after the Jameson Raid the company's relations with the Colonial Office over Rhodesia were difficult, as the Colonial Office was unwilling to recognise the company had to give priority to its commercial interests rather than administration. After Rhodes' death, the BSAC directors attempted to make the company commercially profitable, but until 1924 it was deeply unprofitable because its administrative costs outweighed its commercial income, and it never paid a dividend in that period. After a financial crisis in Britain in 1908, the value of its shares declined sharply: its share capital had to be increased from £6 million to £12 million between 1908 and 1912, and it needed large loans to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>business.</b>|$|E
25|$|Route 26 {{originates}} as {{the alignment}} of the Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike, chartered in 1803 from Warren and Green Streets in Trenton to New Brunswick. The turnpike lasted for 99years, fighting with railroads, canals and stagecoaches to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>business.</b> The road was designated State Highway Route26 in the 1927 state highway renumbering, running from the state line in Trenton to State Highway RouteS-28 in New Brunswick along the turnpike and Livingston Avenue. The route remained intact, becoming part of an engineering feat meant {{for the safety of}} drivers. In 1952, the route became part of the Trenton Freeway until the Route26 designation was truncated back to North Brunswick Township in the 1953 state highway renumbering. The route was further truncated back from Route18 in the 1970s in New Brunswick to its current northern terminus at Nassau Street.|$|E

25|$|On April 2, 2008, ATA {{declared}} bankruptcy and ceased all operations. This sudden end came about after FedEx abruptly canceled ATA's longstanding military charter contract. Combined {{with a significant}} increase in the price of jet fuel, ATA did not have enough capital to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>business.</b> It was the third of four U.S. airlines to announce a complete shut down in the week of March 30, 2008 after Aloha Airlines did so on March 30, Minnesota-based charter Champion Air did so March 31, and Skybus Airlines terminated service on April 5. The shutdown of ATA took effect at 4:00 AM EDT, Thursday April 3, 2008, although some flights were airborne at the time and continued to their destinations, with the final arrival being ATA flight 4586 from Honolulu to Phoenix, which landed at 8:46 AM, MST, or seven hours and 46 minutes after the announced shutdown. At the time of the shutdown ATA employed around 2,300 people all of whom were permanently laid off. According to press reports, up to 10,000 passengers were affected and many of them had to scramble for help on several airlines. Most of them, however, had to pay for new tickets.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} troubles {{faced by}} corn farmers {{can help to}} explain why so many farmers are losing their farms; with decreased profits, and increased production costs many cannot <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>business.</b> These farmers {{have to move to}} find work elsewhere. Along with this, the preference for monocultural agriculture in producing commodity crops has contributed to the depopulation of many rural areas across the American farm belt. Farming used to include the cultivation of a diversity of crops and livestock on one plot of land. When agriculture revolutionized into an industry with the responsibility to produce as much of a certain commodity as possible, it became more efficient to move the animals and other crops off of the land and use the space to grow commodity crops exclusively. The large supply of corn and other grains that resulted from this change made it more efficient to feed and raise livestock in concentrated animal feeding operations indoors rather than in grass pastures; small scale livestock farmers could not compete with the output produced by factory farms using cheap corn-based feed. The simplified practice of cultivating one crop along with the introduction of the tractor and other mechanized farming equipment resulted in less of a need for labor. Therefore, the output of commodity crops from the industrialized farm increased, while the population of surrounding communities decreased. In the early 1900s one fourth of Americans lived on a farm. Currently, fewer than 2 million Americans still farm. According to the National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service, America lost 219,500 farms between 1981 and 1986. The remaining fields were merged to form larger operations. A sustainable rural community depends on the income from successful farms. If people are moving elsewhere to find work, either {{as a result of a}} failed farm or the decreased need for labor resulting from machines, the local economy suffers. With fewer people to support the economy and to provide a tax base, local businesses, churches, schools and clinics may have to close their doors.|$|E
