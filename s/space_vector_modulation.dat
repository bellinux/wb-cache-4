The three phase alternating current induction motor is reviewed based upon <b>space</b> <b>vector</b> representation. The development of <b>space</b> <b>vector</b> pulse width <b>modulation</b> and implementation to speed control of induction motor is done using Matlab/Simulink.

These electric vehicles use induction motors that are designed with a low inductance such that they can run at high speed and therefore have a high power to weight ratio. The inverter switching can cause high current ripple due to the low inductance of these motors. A three-level inverter has been previously developed for electric vehicle applications that produces an improved voltage waveform and therefore has reduced current distortion. This thesis describes the development of an induction motor torque controller for a three-level inverter in an electric vehicle application. Four different induction motor torque control schemes are considered.
