500|$|The {{introduction}} of Ricky Martin as David Martinez was welcomed by most reviewers. Futterman wrote that [...] "Ricky Martin {{carried on the}} Gwyneth Paltrow tradition of pretty great guest teacher cameos", and TVLine Michael Slezak said that the episode was good [...] "at least whenever Ricky Martin appeared on screen". VanDerWerff called him [...] "fun and infectious", and Kate Stanhope of TV Guide said he [...] "showed {{himself to be a}} guest star with mucho potential". Kubicek, though he <b>said</b> <b>Martin</b> was [...] "great at singing", found him [...] "kind of dull as an actor", and Canning <b>said</b> <b>Martin</b> [...] "felt out of place" [...] in the episode.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the second}} day of the trial, Dr. Thomas Andrew, who is Chief Medical Examiner of New Hampshire, <b>said</b> <b>Martin</b> Lee Anderson died as a result of the boot camp guards' actions. [...] He said that {{everything}} combined, including the stress of the encounter and the physical exertion of the run, aggravated Anderson's sickle-cell condition, hampering the flow of oxygen in his blood. [...] "But for these defendants' actions, would Martin Anderson have died?" [...] assistant state attorney Scott Harmon asked. [...] "I would have to say no," [...] Andrew said. [...] He also said that, had the guards given Anderson the opportunity to recover from the run, his death might have been prevented ...|$|E
2500|$|Coldplay {{were first}} accused of {{plagiarism}} of [...] "The Songs I Didn't Write" [...] by American alternative band Creaky Boards, for the melody of [...] "Viva la Vida". Creaky Boards' band member Andrew Hoepfner claimed that Martin had heard them playing the song at a live show in October 2007. The band released a video clip, {{in which it}} compares sections of both songs. Coldplay denied the claim. Band spokesman Murray Chambers <b>said</b> <b>Martin</b> was working in AIR Studios in London at that time, having checked the singer's diary. In addition, Coldplay had recorded a demo version of [...] "Viva la Vida" [...] in March 2007, long before Creaky Boards performed it live in October of the same year. Creaky Boards later retracted the accusations and speculated that both songs may {{have been inspired by}} the video game The Legend of Zelda.|$|E

6000|$|... "Amen to that," [...] <b>said</b> Fred <b>Martin</b> heartily. [...] "You {{feel well}} enough now, sir, {{to think of}} {{undertaking}} service to-morrow, don't you?" ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{night fell}} on August 13, some protesters threw {{projectiles}} at police including Molotov cocktails, and police launched {{tear gas and}} smoke bombs. While police were clearing a McDonald's restaurant, The Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery and The Huffington Post reporter Ryan J. Reilly were arrested. Officers reportedly asked them to leave first, gave them a 45-second countdown {{when they were not}} moving fast enough, and ultimately resorted to more forceful measures to remove people from the McDonald's. [...] "Officers slammed me into a fountain soda machine because I was confused about which door they were asking me to walk out of," [...] Lowery <b>said.</b> <b>Martin</b> Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post, issued a statement, saying [...] "there was absolutely no justification for Wesley Lowery's arrest," [...] and that the police behavior [...] "was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martin's {{work has}} been {{described}} as having [...] "complex story lines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing" [...] by literary critic Jeff VanderMeer. Dana Jennings of the New York Times described Martin's work as [...] "fantasy for grown ups" [...] and Lev Grossman wrote that it was dark and cynical. Martin's first novel, Dying of the Light, set the tone for some of his future work; it unfolds on a mostly abandoned planet that is slowly becoming uninhabitable as it moves away from its sun. This story has a strong sense of melancholy. His characters are often unhappy or, at least, unsatisfied, in many cases holding on to idealisms in spite of an otherwise chaotic and ruthless world, and often troubled by their own self-seeking or violent actions, even as they undertake them. Many have elements of tragic heroes or antiheroes in them; reviewer T. M. Wagner writes: [...] "Let it never be <b>said</b> <b>Martin</b> doesn't share Shakespeare's fondness for the senselessly tragic." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 6, 2008, {{the writers}} {{followed}} through with their {{plan to have}} Todd engage in sex with Marty. As part of their agreement with RAINN, ABC aired a rape-themed PSA after the sex scene. Viewers and critics were outraged by the show's decision to allow the sex scene, and called the scene the [...] "second rape of Marty" [...] and Marty's [...] "re-rape/rapemance". Not long after the scene, Marty discovers Todd as her rapist. Characters within the series, including Marty herself, interchangeably refer to the incident as rape and as [...] "having had sex". Despite Todd and Marty's dark history, fans of the couple emerged; critics cited this as an irresponsible result of the storyline {{and the majority of}} these fans as young teenagers. They called the storyline reprehensible. Ed Martin of The Jack Myers Report said he had to agree with fans complaining about the storyline. [...] "This tale, though well told, has been sickening given the history of these characters," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Martin.</b> [...] "I don’t believe that sex between two adults can be mutually consenting when one of the people involved has no idea what’s really going on, and especially when one of the two is a depraved brute who previously attacked the other." [...] He added, [...] "The writers had already established the inner conflict Todd was experiencing in the moments before he had sex with Marty. (He was even having flashbacks to the gang rape)." [...] Martin argued, [...] "Rather than take her to bed, he should have broken down, confessed everything to her and taken her rage. There would have been no question at that time that Todd had indeed changed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My good friend!' <b>said</b> old <b>Martin,</b> laying {{his hand}} on Chuffey's sleeve. 'This {{is no place for}} you to remain in. Come with me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There now," [...] <b>said</b> Fred <b>Martin,</b> when at {{last the}} bandage was removed and the festering mass laid bare. [...] "Hand the scissors, Pat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{got your}} sea legs at last, sir," [...] <b>said</b> Fred <b>Martin,</b> as Binning came on deck and {{staggered}} towards {{him with a}} joyful salutation.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The same,' <b>said</b> <b>Martin</b> '--will be at once {{apparent}} to you. I have completed my arrangements {{for going to}} America; {{and you will be}} surprised to hear that I am to be accompanied by Mark Tapley, upon whom I have stumbled strangely in London, and who insists on putting himself under my protection'--meaning, my love,' <b>said</b> <b>Martin,</b> breaking off again, 'our friend in the rear, of course.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We quite {{understand}} each other, my good fellow,' <b>said</b> <b>Martin</b> rising in self-approval and condescension. 'We {{are no longer}} master and servant, but friends and partners; and are mutually gratified. If we determine on Eden, the business shall be commenced {{as soon as we}} get there. Under the name,' <b>said</b> <b>Martin,</b> who never hammered upon an idea that wasn't red hot, 'under the name of Chuzzlewit and Tapley.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Black," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Martin,</b> [...] "here; {{all down}} this road-casual labour, criminals, loafers, drunkards, consumps. Look at the faces!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a bitterly cold night," [...] <b>said</b> Mrs. <b>Martin</b> wearily. There {{was a note}} of discouragement in {{her voice}} that struck dismay to Theodora's heart.|$|R
6000|$|The obsequious Mr Pecksniff proffered his arm. The old {{man took}} it. Turning at the door, he <b>said</b> to <b>Martin,</b> waving {{him off with}} his hand, ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your delicacy,' <b>said</b> old <b>Martin,</b> 'is troubled, I perceive. I am not {{surprised}} to find it so. You have chosen the period of your marriage unfortunately.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Against any {{architect}} in the States,' <b>said</b> <b>Martin.</b> 'Get {{a couple}} of sherry-cobblers, Mark, and we'll drink success to the firm.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Martin,</b> [...] "that's a love-letter, isn't it, to that splendid, black-eyed marchioness, whom I saw {{looking at}} you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Another time {{perhaps you}} won't be so lazy, and will bring food for yourself,' <b>said</b> <b>Martin,</b> {{but to his}} {{surprise}} Jack answered: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{ask you if}} {{you call}} this FAIR to the boy, Mr. Twing?" [...] <b>said</b> Mrs. <b>Martin</b> hotly; [...] "but is this your idea of discipline?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I don't mind that; it's only twopence a piece more,' <b>said</b> Mr. <b>Martin.</b> 'What do you say, now? We'll pay you out for three-and-sixpence a week. Come!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is insufferable," [...] <b>said</b> Mrs. <b>Martin,</b> {{her eyes}} growing darker as her cheeks grew red. [...] "They shall {{go home to}} their parents, and tell them from me"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Has it ever {{occurred}} to you,' <b>said</b> <b>Martin,</b> 'that your married life may perhaps be miserable, full of bitterness, and most unhappy?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm safe now!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Martin</b> aloud, as {{he threw}} down his bundle beneath a {{spreading}} tree and commenced to prepare breakfast.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Here! Please {{to give me}} {{the most}} you can for this,' <b>said</b> <b>Martin,</b> handing the watch to the shopman. 'I want money sorely.' ...|$|E
50|$|Next, {{testimony}} {{came from}} Andrew Gaugh, {{who was the}} 7-Eleven clerk that sold <b>Martin</b> snacks. He <b>said</b> that <b>Martin</b> paid with cash, {{and he did not}} see anything suspicious about Martin's behavior.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{a poison}} {{ring of the}} Borgias,' <b>said</b> Miss <b>Martin.</b> 'I {{borrowed}} it from Sir Josiah Wilkinson. If it scratched you' (here she exhibited the mechanism of the jewel), 'why, there you are!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There {{is never}} {{anybody in the}} smoking-room {{at the top of}} the house,' <b>said</b> Miss <b>Martin,</b> 'because--to let out a secret--none of us ever smoke, except at public dinners to give tone. But you may.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{ask your}} {{forgiveness}} a thousand times, my dear fellow,' <b>said</b> <b>Martin.</b> 'I couldn't have helped it, if death {{had been the}} penalty.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is not,' <b>said</b> <b>Martin,</b> {{waving his}} hand impatiently, 'my habit to put my--well! my relatives--to any {{personal}} expense to gratify my caprices.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now let me go,' <b>said</b> <b>Martin,</b> {{putting down}} the wine {{when he had}} merely touched it with his lips. 'My dears, good morning!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh, it's a poor {{look-out}} when th' ould folks doesna {{like the}} young uns," [...] <b>said</b> old <b>Martin,</b> bending {{his head down}} lower, and seeming to trace {{the pattern of the}} quarries with his eye.|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{alleged that}} while Zimmerman {{was talking to}} the dispatcher, Martin {{was on the phone with}} a friend and she <b>said</b> that <b>Martin</b> was scared because he was being {{followed}} by an unknown man. Investigators <b>said</b> that <b>Martin</b> attempted to run home, but Zimmerman followed him because he didn't want Martin to get away. When the police dispatcher realized Zimmerman was following Martin, he told Zimmerman that was unnecessary and that police would meet him there. Prosecutors alleged that Zimmerman ignored the dispatcher and continued following Martin and confronted him and a struggle ensued. When police arrived at the scene, Zimmerman admitted to shooting Martin in the chest.|$|R
2500|$|Coretta Scott King's {{support of}} LGBT rights was {{strongly}} criticized by some black pastors. She called her critics [...] "misinformed" [...] and <b>said</b> that <b>Martin</b> Luther King's {{message to the}} world was one of equality and inclusion.|$|R
