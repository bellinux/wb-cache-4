60|$|He {{sat down}} by a little stream that ran along the roadside, and bathed his aching feet; he washed his face and hands; <b>starting</b> <b>down</b> the hill, {{he made his way}} towards the town and entered the gate.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{was afraid}} {{we would get}} mixed up in it ourselves.

60|$|Before <b>starting</b> <b>down</b> {{he waited}} {{to catch his}} breath. He had climbed far up that {{wonderful}} smooth slope, and had almost reached the base of yellow cliff that rose skyward, a huge scarred and cracked bulk. It frowned down upon him as if to forbid further ascent. Venters bent over for his rifle, and, as {{he picked it up}} from where it leaned against the steeper grade, he saw several little nicks cut in the solid stone.|$|E
60|$|Now she {{imagined}} the gloomy day had re-acted on her spirits. She was moody and longed {{for something that}} would banish the dreariness. <b>Starting</b> <b>down</b> hill for the station, she stopped abruptly a few moments afterwards. Lister was crossing the street, and if she went on they would meet. It was some time since {{she had seen him}} and she noted with surprise that he wore a rather soiled blue uniform. His cap, which had a badge in front, was greasy, and he carried an oilskin coat.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy Skunk {{opened his}} eyes very early one morning and peeped out of his snug little house on the hill. Big, round Mr. Sun, with a very red, smiling face, {{had just begun to}} climb up into the sky. Old Mother West Wind was just <b>starting</b> <b>down</b> to the Green Meadows with her big bag over her shoulder. In that bag Jimmy Skunk knew she carried all her children, the Merry Little Breezes, whom she was taking down to the Green Meadows to play and frolic all day.|$|E

6000|$|... "Look here, young man," [...] Captain Glass rumbled threateningly at his mate. [...] "Are you romantic? Because if you are, {{on board}} you stay. Fuatino's {{the island of}} romantic insanity. Everybody's in love with somebody. They live on love. It's in the milk of the cocoa-nuts, or the air, or the sea. The history of the island {{for the last ten}} {{thousand}} years is nothing but love affairs. I know. I've talked with the old men. And if I catch you <b>starting</b> <b>down</b> the beach hand in hand--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And oh, miss," [...] says Charley, {{clapping}} her hands, {{with the}} tears <b>starting</b> <b>down</b> her dimpled cheeks, [...] "Tom's at school, if you please, and learning so good! And little Emma, she's with Mrs. Blinder, miss, a-being took such care of! And Tom, {{he would have}} been at school--and Emma, s{{he would have been}} left with Mrs. Blinder--and me, I should have been here--all a deal sooner, miss; only Mr. Jarndyce thought that Tom and Emma and me had better get a little used to parting first, we was so small. Don't cry, if you please, miss!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you will think of us, but we are {{escaping}} from this place. The truth is that I am not well, and my daughter can bear it no longer. She says that if she stops here, she will die, and that hunting for treasure in that ghastly grave-yard is shattering her nerves. I should have liked to tell you, but she begged me not, being convinced that if I did, you would over-persuade us or stop us in some way. As for the gold, {{if you can find}} it, take it all. I renounce my share. We are leaving you the waggon and the oxen, and <b>starting</b> <b>down</b> country on our horses. It is a perilous business, but less so than staying here, under the circumstances. If we never meet again we hope that you will forgive us, and wish you all good fortune.--Yours sincerely and with much regret, ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{had just}} {{realized}} how light {{it was and}} had started for home, hurrying with all my might, when I heard a little noise {{at the top of}} the hill where Prickly Porky the Porcupine lives. Of course I thought it was Prickly himself starting out for his breakfast, and I looked up with my mouth open to say hello. But I didn't say hello. No, Sir, I didn't say a word. I was too scared. There, just <b>starting</b> <b>down</b> the hill straight towards me, was the most dreadful creature that ever has been seen in the Green Forest! It didn't have any legs, and it didn't have any head, and it didn't have any tail, and it was coming straight after me so fast that I had all I could do to get out of the way!" [...] Peter's eyes grew very round and wide as he said this. [...] "I took one good look, and then I jumped. My gracious, how I did jump!" [...] he continued. [...] "Then I started for home just as fast as ever I could make my legs go, and here I am, and mighty glad to be here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|HE saw {{her from}} the bottom of the stairs [...] Before she saw him. She was <b>starting</b> <b>down,</b> [...] Looking back over her {{shoulder}} at some fear. [...] She took a doubtful step and then undid it [...] To raise herself and look again. He spoke [...] Advancing toward her: [...] "What is it you see [...] From up there always--for I want to know." [...] She turned and sank upon her skirts at that, [...] And her face changed from terrified to dull. [...] He said to gain time: [...] "What is it you see," [...] Mounting until she cowered under him. [...] "I will find out now--you must tell me, dear." [...] She, in her place, refused him any help [...] With the least stiffening of her neck and silence. [...] She let him look, sure that he wouldn't see, [...] Blind creature; and a while he didn't see. [...] But at last he murmured, [...] "Oh," [...] and again, [...] "Oh." [...] "What is it--what?" [...] she said. [...] "Just that I see." [...] "You don't," [...] she challenged. [...] "Tell me what it is." [...] "The wonder is I didn't see at once. [...] I never noticed it from here before. [...] I must be wonted to it--that's the reason. [...] The little graveyard where my people are! [...] So small the window frames the whole of it. [...] Not so much larger than a bedroom, is it? [...] There are three stones of slate and one of marble, [...] Broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight [...] On the sidehill. We haven't to mind those. [...] But I understand: it is not the stones, [...] But the child's mound----" [...] "Don't, don't, don't, don't," [...] she cried. [...] She withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm [...] That rested on the banister, and slid downstairs; [...] And turned on him with such a daunting look, [...] He said twice over before he knew himself: [...] "Can't a man speak of his own child he's lost?" [...] "Not you! Oh, where's my hat? Oh, I don't need it! [...] I must get out of here. I must get air. [...] I don't know rightly whether any man can." [...] "Amy! Don't go to someone else this time. [...] Listen to me. I won't come down the stairs." [...] He sat and fixed his chin between his fists. [...] "There's something I should like to ask you, dear." [...] "You don't know how to ask it." [...] "Help me, then." [...] Her fingers moved the latch for all reply. [...] "My words are nearly always an offence. [...] I don't know how to speak of anything [...] So as to please you. But I might be taught [...] I should suppose. I can't say I see how. [...] A man must partly give up being a man [...] With women-folk. We could have some arrangement [...] By which I'd bind myself to keep hands off [...] Anything special you're a-mind to name. [...] Though I don't like such things 'twixt those that love. [...] Two that don't love can't live together without them. [...] But two that do can't live together with them." [...] She moved the latch a little. [...] "Don't--don't go. [...] Don't carry it to someone else this time. [...] Tell me about it if it's something human. [...] Let me into your grief. I'm not so much [...] Unlike other folks as your standing there [...] Apart would make me out. Give me my chance. [...] I do think, though, you overdo it a little. [...] What was it brought you up to think it the thing [...] To take your mother-loss of a first child [...] So inconsolably--in the face of love. [...] You'd think his memory might be satisfied----" [...] "There you go sneering now!" [...] "I'm not, I'm not! [...] You make me angry. I'll come down to you. [...] God, what a woman! And it's come to this, [...] A man can't speak of his own child that's dead." [...] "You can't because you don't know how. [...] If you had any feelings, you that dug [...] With your own hand--how could you?--his little grave; [...] I saw you from that very window there, [...] Making the gravel leap and leap in air, [...] Leap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly [...] And roll back down the mound beside the hole. [...] I thought, Who is that man? I didn't know you. [...] And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs [...] To look again, and still your spade kept lifting. [...] Then you came in. I heard your rumbling voice [...] Out in the kitchen, and I don't know why, [...] But I went near to see with my own eyes. [...] You could sit there with the stains on your shoes [...] Of the fresh earth from your own baby's grave [...] And talk about your everyday concerns. [...] You had stood the spade up against the wall [...] Outside there in the entry, for I saw it." [...] "I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed. [...] I'm cursed. God, if I don't believe I'm cursed." [...] "I can repeat the very words you were saying. [...] 'Three foggy mornings and one rainy day [...] Will rot the best birch fence a man can build.' [...] Think of it, talk like that at such a time! [...] What had how long it takes a birch to rot [...] To do with what was in the darkened parlour. [...] You couldn't care! The nearest friends can go [...] With anyone to death, comes so far short [...] They might as well not try to go at all. [...] No, from the time when one is sick to death, [...] One is alone, and he dies more alone. [...] Friends make pretence of following to the grave, [...] But before one is in it, their minds are turned [...] And making the best of their way back to life [...] And living people, and things they understand. [...] But the world's evil. I won't have grief so [...] If I can change it. Oh, I won't, I won't!" [...] "There, you have said it all and you feel better. [...] You won't go now. You're crying. Close the door. [...] The heart's gone out of it: why keep it up. [...] Amy! There's someone coming down the road!" [...] "You--oh, you think the talk is all. I must go-- [...] Somewhere out of this house. How can I make you----" [...] "If--you--do!" [...] She was opening the door wider. [...] "Where do you mean to go? First tell me that. [...] I'll follow and bring you back by force. I will!--" ...|$|E
