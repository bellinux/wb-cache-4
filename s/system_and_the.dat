5|$|All {{projections}} {{of the future of}} the Earth, the Solar <b>System,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must increase over time. Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel and burn out. Close encounters gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the results}} of the Greek and Islamic {{influence}} on this period in European history was the replacement of Roman numerals with the decimal positional number <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> invention of algebra, which allowed more advanced mathematics. Astronomy advanced following the translation of Ptolemy's Almagest from Greek into Latin in the late 12th century. Medicine was also studied, especially in southern Italy, where Islamic medicine influenced the school at Salerno.|$|E
5|$|As {{his second}} {{administration}} began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland {{was unable to}} reverse. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening {{the way for a}} Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party <b>System</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Progressive Era.|$|E

5|$|Clash of Ninja was {{originally}} released in Japan on April 11, 2003, {{and the game}} was subsequently released in North America on March 7, 2006, with the only major difference being the voice-overs by the English voice actors from the Naruto anime. Critical opinions of the game have been mixed, with many praising the simple and easy-to-learn fighting system, with others lambasting the fighting <b>system,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lack of significant unlockable content.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} networking approach to infinite-dimensional systems theory, {{where there is}} a minimal distinction between inputs and outputs. We introduce and study two closely related classes of systems, namely <b>the</b> state/signal <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> port-Hamiltonian <b>systems,</b> <b>and</b> describe how they relate to each other. Some basic theory for these two classes of <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> interconnections of such systems is provided. The main emphasis lies on passive <b>and</b> conservative <b>systems,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> theoretical concepts are illustrated using the example of a lossless transfer line. Much remains to be done in this field and we point to some directions for future studies as well...|$|R

5|$|Consequently, {{the changes}} in {{property}} rights, relations between feudal lords and peasants, the taxation <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> enactment of devşirme resulted in further resistance. As changes affecting both nobles and peasants were principally implemented through registration in the cadastral survey, many families tried to avoid becoming registered in the 1431–2 survey and took refugee in mountainous areas, while the nobility prepared for armed conflict.|$|E
5|$|Crawley's early {{development}} as a market town was helped by its location on the London–Brighton turnpike. The area was joined to the railway network in the mid-19th century; and since {{the creation of the}} new town, there have been major road upgrades (including a motorway link), a guided bus transit <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> establishment of an airport which has become one of Britain's largest and busiest.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive.

The new control scheme was also considered more intuitive and satisfying, especially for new players.|$|E
