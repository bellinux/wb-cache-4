30|$|Many {{barriers}} to participation can be partially circumvented through appropriate training and ongoing support. The research topics under scrutiny {{and the nature}} of research findings may be more impactful for people with lived experiences. For example, peer researchers working with CREST.BD found qualitative statements about stigma to be highly distressing. It is also important to consider the incredible variability in how those with BD may feel over time—by definition, BD involves extreme fluctuations in energy, motivation, concentration, and social function, and these fluctuations need to be planned for in thinking about how to build a successful team of collaborators. Team leaders should plan in advance for how they will address emergent symptoms, and how and when to give a person a break should symptoms emerge. Effective strategies for supporting peer researchers with BD in the CREST.BD and Spectrum include: comprehensive training programmes, the appointment of multiple peer researchers who share research tasks to allow for periods of down-time (e.g. CREST.BD currently has three <b>social</b> <b>media</b> <b>interns</b> who live with BD who take collective responsibility for Web 2.0 outputs; the CREST.BD Community Advisory Group is co-chaired by two people with BD; Spectrum employs two relatives to moderate an online toolkit supporting relatives of people with BD or psychosis), provision of both clinical/academic and peer supervision and sensitive skill matching of individuals to tasks.|$|R

This analysis was performed with the Insight data of Facebook's page which provide 4 different count values named day, day_ 28, week and lifetime respectively. To analyze the company's performance in various countries, aggregation was performed to find total users in a country those are engaged with different Facebook pages. All these four counts were used to compare various companies popularity using various measures like Total Country in which people knows about Company, Top-K Country and Least-K country, Count Comparison, Country wise Standard Deviation, Correlation between two companies in a country.

40|$|Why {{is it so}} {{difficult}} to resist the desire to use <b>social</b> <b>media?</b> One possibility is that frequent <b>social</b> <b>media</b> users possess strong and spontaneous hedonic reactions to <b>social</b> <b>media</b> cues, which, in turn, {{makes it difficult to}} resist <b>social</b> <b>media</b> temptations. In two studies (total N = 200), we investigated less frequent and frequent <b>social</b> <b>media</b> users’ spontaneous hedonic reactions to <b>social</b> <b>media</b> cues using the Affect Misattribution Procedure - an implicit measure of affective reactions. Results demonstrated that frequent <b>social</b> <b>media</b> users showed more favorable affective reactions in response to <b>social</b> <b>media</b> (vs. control) cues, whereas less frequent <b>social</b> <b>media</b> users' affective reactions did not differ between <b>social</b> <b>media</b> and control cues (Studies 1 and 2). Moreover, the spontaneous hedonic reactions to <b>social</b> <b>media</b> (vs. control) cues were related to self-reported cravings to use <b>social</b> <b>media</b> and partially accounted for the link between <b>social</b> <b>media</b> use and <b>social</b> <b>media</b> cravings (Study 2). These findings suggest that frequent <b>social</b> <b>media</b> users' spontaneous hedonic reactions in response to <b>social</b> <b>media</b> cues might contribute to their difficulties in resisting desires to use <b>social</b> <b>media...</b>|$|R

40|$|Political {{parties can}} {{potentially}} benefit from <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> to shape interactions between their members. This chapter presents the <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> Participation Model (SMPM), which measures {{the effects of}} <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> Participation on political party communities. As people and politicians increasingly adopt <b>Social</b> <b>Media,</b> measuring the effects of <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> participation on party communities has become more important. However, a literature review revealed that currently there are few measurement methods. Furthermore, most politicians {{do not know how}} to use <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> effectively. Therefore, we propose the <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> Participation Model that reflects two concepts: <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> Participation and Community Participation. To measure <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> Participation, we developed the <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> Indicator to assess the <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> use by politicians. Additionally, we integrate media choice theory to evaluate appropriateness of <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> for certain tasks and strategies. For measuring Community Participation, we deploy the following two constructs: Community Engagement and Sense of Community. By obtaining results from the <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> Participation Model, it will be clear which use of <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> positively influence member participation within political communities. This model is the first step in developing a standardized instrument to explore the impact of <b>Social</b> <b>Media</b> Participation on Community Participation. ...|$|R

University libraries have started to create and use <b>social</b> <b>media</b> policies that can guide them to manage <b>social</b> <b>media</b> accounts safely and to provide an effective communication between users and librarians. This study aims {{to determine whether the}} university libraries using <b>social</b> <b>media</b> has been consulting a guide, while operating, managing and controlling <b>social</b> <b>media</b> accounts. In this context a survey has been conducted upon 90 university libraries that use <b>social</b> <b>media</b> where 67 of them have been actual participants. Only 5 of these libraries were using a <b>social</b> <b>media</b> policy created for their own library. While 10 of them were using a <b>social</b> <b>media</b> policy created for their university, 44 of them didn't have any guide related to <b>social</b> <b>media</b> usage. It was also examined whether librarians working in the university libraries that use <b>social</b> <b>media</b> have been aware of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> presence of their libraries and whether they need to have a guide document like <b>social</b> <b>media</b> policy. It can be said that librarians are mostly aware of the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> presence of the library, however some of them were hesitating about how they should act when they encounter a problematic content. Additionally, most of the participants believe that a guide document like <b>social</b> <b>media</b> policy should be used by libraries. With regard to this, a <b>social</b> <b>media</b> policy for Turkish university libraries is proposed in this study...|$|R
40|$|Objective Adolescents {{are known}} to be high users of <b>social</b> <b>media,</b> and <b>social</b> <b>media</b> is {{beginning}} to be used in health care. The primary objective of this review was to determine the current state of play on the use of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> as a health intervention in addressing the health of adolescents. Methods Six databases were searched: CINAHL, Medline, Scopus, ProQuest, Psych Info and Science Direct, from 2000 - 2013. The review process followed PRISMA guidelines with quality assessments of the selected articles undertaken. Results Three studies used <b>social</b> <b>media</b> as a health intervention in adolescent health. Facebook was the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> of choice. The way this <b>social</b> <b>media</b> tool was incorporated as the intervention varied. None of the <b>social</b> <b>media</b> interventions had a significant or sustained impact on the primary outcomes of the studies reviewed. Measures of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> process were limited and lacked meaning. Conclusions The selected papers provided insight into the beginning phase of using <b>social</b> <b>media</b> as a health intervention to address adolescent health. The review highlights three important areas for consideration when undertaking research on the use of <b>social</b> <b>media</b> as a health intervention for adolescents: the newness of using <b>social</b> <b>media</b> as a health intervention, the importance of the use of rigorous methodological processes when using <b>social</b> <b>media</b> as a health intervention, and the need to develop further knowledge on adolescents' use of <b>social</b> <b>media,</b> in particular their hidden world of <b>social</b> <b>media.</b> Griffith Health, School of Nursing and MidwiferyFull Tex...|$|R
