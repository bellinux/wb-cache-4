Interestingly, the overall formulation requires a single mesh of the section to compute both the modal solutions and the scattering.

40|$|Silicon based {{integrated}} circuits has been dominating the electronics technology {{industry in the}} last few decades. As the telecommunications and the computing industry slowly converges together, the need for a material to build photonics {{integrated circuits}} (PIC) that can be cost-effective and be produced in mass market has become very important. This thesis describes and outlines the characteristics of high index contrast waveguides as a building blocks that can be designed, fabricated and employed on devices in silicon photonics. Initially in this work, a fully vectorial H-field based finite element method has been used to obtain the modal characteristics of high index contrast bent waveguide to get {{a better understanding of the}} curved section. Through the beam propagation method, the propagation losses and the spot-size along the propagation distance are obtained when a mode from the <b>straight</b> <b>guide</b> is launched into a bent guide. It is also learnt that mode beating exists at the junction of a straight-to-bent waveguide, in which higher order modes will also be generated. It will be shown in this work that power do exchange between the two polarization states, therefore the polarization conversion, the power losses and the bending losses will be investigated. It will also shown in here that by applying lateral offsets with coupled waveguides of unequal widths, the insertion loss can be reduced. Secondly, for a high index contrast waveguide such as the silicon strip waveguide with a nanoscale cross-section, modes in such waveguide are not purely TE or TM but hybrid in nature, with all the six components of their E and H-fields being present. Therefore a detail analysis of the modal field profiles along with the Poynting vector profile will be shown. The effects of waveguide's width and height on the effective indices, the hybridness, the modal effective area and the power confinement in the core or cladding has been studied. Furthermore the modal birefringence of such strip waveguide will be shown. It will be presented that for a strip waveguide with height of 260 nm, single mode exists in the region of the width being 200 nm to 400 nm and that the modal effective is at its minimum when width is around 320 nm for both polarization states. Thirdly, a compact polarization rotator with an asymmetric waveguide structure design, suitable for fabrication that does not require a slanted side wall or curved waveguide is considered in this work. It will be shown in here that due to the hybrid nature of the asymmetric waveguide design, maximum polarization rotation (from TE to TM) will be achieve by enhancing the non-dominant field profile of both polarized fundamental mode. As the modal hybridness and the propagation constants of both polarized modes will be obtained, the half-beat length, polarization conversion and polarization cross-talk will be calculated by using the FEM and the least squares residual boundary method (LSBR). It is learnt that a compact single stage polarization rotator with a device length of 48 μm with more than 99 % of polarization conversion is achieved in this work. Finally, a study of vertical and horizontal slot waveguide will be shown. Based on silicon strip waveguide, a detail modal characteristics of E and H-fields along with the Poynting vectors are presented. It will be shown that for slot waveguide, high power confinement and power density will be achieved in the slot area. It will be presented that by optimising the waveguide and slot dimension, the performance of the power confinement and power density in the slot region can be improved.

Although it is difficult to talk about their polyphonic or polymorphic characteristics, the clear and dramatic functional narratological structure of his movie stories should be pointed out, so much more since Nikolic never dealt with esoteric subjects and vain speculations, but he tried to rise the narrative statement to a level of absolute recognition, especially when he the anthropological discourse embodied in traditional norms, mystical and theological dogmas were involved. In such an approach, abstracting <b>straight</b> <b>guided</b> plot lines and extensive exposures, we can undoubtedly speak of full compliance and permeation of all the expressive constituents of the diegetic structure in Nikolic's movies. A strongly emphasised demystification of ultra-traditional interpretation of eros and simultaneously its relationship with ethos, the constant confrontation with extreme ethical views and distorted visions, as well as his persistence in debunking the dominant and burdensome taboos, are particularly important in Nikolic's narrative.

The Teramobile project, supported by the French CNRS and the German DFG has been launched in 1999 to study the filamentation propagation and to develop applications in the atmosphere, by using this world-wide unique mobile multi-terawatt laser [1]. One of the main applications is lightning control. In this respect, we investigated the triggering and guiding of high voltage discharges, which is the first step towards atmospheric scale experiments. Unlike previous experiments, where discharges were triggered by a plasma focus, we used for the first time long conducting filaments. This opens new perspectives in lightning control.

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the herringbone gear {{is that it}} cannot be cut by simple gear hobbing machines, as the cutter would run into {{the other half of}} the gear. Solutions to this have included assembling small gears by stacking two helical gears together, cutting the gears with a central groove to provide clearance, and (particularly in the early days) by casting the gears to an accurate pattern and without further machining. With the older method of fabrication, herringbone gears had a central channel separating the two oppositely-angled courses of teeth. This was necessary to permit the shaving tool to run out of the groove. The development of the Sykes gear shaper made it possible to have continuous teeth with no central gap. Sunderland, also in England, also produced a herringbone cutting machine. The Sykes uses cylindrical guides and round cutters; the Sunderland uses <b>straight</b> <b>guides</b> and rack-type cutters. The W. E. Sykes Co. dissolved in 1983-84. Since then it has been common practice to obtain an older machine and rebuild it if necessary to create this unique type of gear. Recently, the Bourn and Koch company has developed a CNC-controlled derivation of the W. E. Sykes design called the HDS1600-300. This machine, like the Sykes gear shaper, has the ability to generate a true apex without the need for a clearance groove cut around the gear. This allows the gears to be used in positive displacement pumping applications, as well as power transmission. Helical gears with low weight, accuracy and strength may be 3D printed.|$|R
40|$|In high {{precision}} equipment, {{the use of}} compliant mechanisms is favourable as elastic joints offer the advantages of low friction and no backlash. If the constraints in a compliant mechanism are not carefully dealt with, even small misalignments can lead to changes in natural frequencies and stiffnesses. Such unwanted behaviour can be avoided by applying exact constraint design, which implies that the mechanism should have exactly the required degrees of freedom and non-redundant constraints so {{that the system is}} kinematically and statically determinate. For this purpose, we propose a kinematic analysis using a finite element based multibody modelling approach. In compliant mechanisms, the system’s degrees of freedom are presented clearly from the analysis of a system in which the deformation modes with a low stiffness are free to deform while the deformation modes with a high stiffness are considered rigid. If the Jacobian matrix associated with the dependent coordinates is not full column or row rank, the system is under-constrained or over-constrained. The rank of this matrix is calculated from a singular value decomposition. For an under-constrained system, any motion in the mechanism that is not accounted for by the current set of degrees of freedom is visualised using data from the right singular matrix. For an over-constrained system, a statically indeterminate stress distribution is derived from the left singular matrix and is used to visualise the over-constraints. The analysis is exemplified for the design of a <b>straight</b> <b>guiding</b> mechanism, where under-constrained and over-constrained conditions are visualised clearly...|$|R
