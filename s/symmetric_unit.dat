40|$|The {{formation}} of a perfect vertebrate body plan poses many questions that thrill developmental biologists.

40|$|Coupling the neutronic and thermal-hydraulic {{analyses}} {{of a nuclear}} reactor core is im-portant because it helps identify the most relevant safety issues. Currently all coupled computations solve {{the same set of}} governing equations using different coupling meth-ods, which can be sorted into two categories: loose coupling and tight coupling. This dissertation proposes and verifies a third coupled approach called “the Integrated Tight Coupling (ITC) method”. The mathematical equations in the nuclear fuel are rearranged to be integrated via a novel concept of group temperature. In addition, the data from the neutron cross section library can be used directly. The ITC method is implemented using two open-source codes: the DRAGON code and OpenFOAM. Additionally, a coupled computation using these two codes is new and has not been done in the past.

We investigated also the surface states induced by the presence of perturbation of the surface areas of the magnonic crystals.

For surface states existing in magnonic crystals in dipolar regime we demonstrated that spin waves preserve distinct differences to the electronic crystals, which are due to long-range dynamic dipolar interactions. We found that tuning of the strength of magnetization pinning resulting from the surface anisotropy or dipolar effect is vitally important for existence of the surface states in magnonic crystals...|$|E

40|$|There are two {{alternative}} pathways {{by which}} {{inverted repeat sequences}} in supercoiled DNA molecules may extrude cruciform structures, called C-type and S-type. S-type cruciforms, which form the great majority, are characterised by absolute requirement for cations to promote extrusion, which then proceeds at higher temperatures and with lower activation parameters than for C-type cruciforms. The mechanism proposed for S-type extrusion involves an initial opening of basepairs limited to {{the centre of the}} inverted repeat, formation of intra-strand basepairing and a four-way junction, and finally branch migration to the fully extruded cruciform. The model predicts that central sequence changes will be more kinetically significant than those removed from the centre. We have studied the kinetics of cruciform extrusion by a series of inverted repeats related to that of pIRbke 8 by either one or two mutations in the <b>symmetric</b> <b>unit.</b> We find that mutations in the central 8 to 10 nucleotides may profoundly affect extrusion rates- the fastest being 2000 -fold faster than the slowest, whereas mutations further from the centre affect rates to a much smaller extent, typically up to ten-fold.

40|$|A novel supramolecular {{approach}} {{to the design of}} NADH models is presented in this dissertation. The models can be divided into two types, C 2 symmetric and D 2 symmetric macrocyclic structures. The C 2 symmetric models are made from a chiral C 2 <b>symmetric</b> <b>unit,</b> two dihydronicotinamide units and a phenylene spacer, to form a macrocyclic structure. The use of cyclic models has restricted the number of possible conformations of the NADH models. By this method, H 4 R and H 4 S in the dihydropyridine ring have been made distinctly different, as shown by their different 1 H-NMR shifts in the C 2 symmetric models. Furthermore, zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) has been used to determine which of the two, H 4 R or H 4 S, is the reactive hydrogen. One of the models has been shown, by deuterium marking, to stereospecifically deliver only one of the diastereotopic hydrogens to a reactive carbonyl compound via a boat-like structure of the dihydropyridine ring. By the use of ZnTPP as a shift reagent, it could be determined that zinc coordinates to the carboxamide oxygen of the C 2 symmetric NADH model. Furthermore, the enantiomeric excess, when reducing methyl phenyl pyruvate to methyl mandelate, is high. Based on the ordered structure of the NADH model and the knowledge of which hydrogen is the reactive one, a refined mechanistic model has been suggested. The D 2 symmetric NADH models are introduced as potential chiral hydride transfer reagents. The models are made from two C 2 symmetric chiral units with two pyridinium ions each. By connecting these units with phenylene spacers, a hydrophobic cavity is formed and the pyridinium ions act as ion-pairing devices. It has been shown that these macrocyclic compounds with paraphenylene spacers have the capacity to encapsulate small charged and polar guests. This host also forms a complex with N-benzyldihydronicotinamide in water. In this complex, a hydride ion is transferred from the guest to the host...|$|E
40|$|In a Minkowski three {{dimensional}} space, whose metric {{is based}} on a strictly convex and centrally <b>symmetric</b> <b>unit</b> ball, we deal with ruled surfaces Φ in the sense of E. Kruppa. This means that we have to look for Minkowski analogues of the classical differential invariants of ruled surfaces in a Euclidean space. Here, at first – after an introduction to concepts of a Minkowski space, like semi-orthogonalities and a semi-inner-product based on the so-called cosine-Minkowski function - we construct an orthogonal 3 D moving frame using Birkhoff’s left-orthogonality. This moving frame is canonically connected to ruled surfaces: beginning with the generator direction and the asymptotic plane of this generator g we complete this flag to a frame using the left-orthogonality defined by; (is described either by its supporting function or a parameter representation). The plane left-orthogonal to the asymptotic plane through generator g(t) is called Minkowski central plane and touches Φ in the striction point s(t) of g(t). Thus the moving frame defines the Minkowski striction curve S of the considered ruled surface Φ similar to the Euclidean case. The coefficients occurring in the Minkowski analogues to Frenet-Serret formulae of the moving frame of Φ in a Minkowski space are called “M-curvatures” and “M-torsions”. Here we essentially make use of the semi-inner product and the sine-Minkowski and cosine-Minkowski functions. Furthermore we define a covariant differentiation in a Minkowski 3 -space using a new vector called “deformation vector” and locally measuring the deviation of the Minkowski space from a Euclidean space. With this covariant differentiation it is possible to declare an “M-geodesicc parallelity” and to show that the vector field of the generators of a skew ruled surface Φ is an M-geodesic parallel field along its Minkowski striction curve s. Finally we also define the Pirondini set of ruled surfaces to a given surface Φ. The surfaces of such a set have the M-striction curve and the strip of M-central planes in commo...|$|E
