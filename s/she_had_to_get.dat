5|$|Massaro was a {{contestant}} on CBS's , {{which was}} the fifteenth season of the show, in 2007. Massaro approached the WWE {{with the idea of}} doing the show, and after going through the casting process, she found out she made the show ten days before she had to leave for China to film. Prior to the experience, Massaro had never been camping before, so to train for the show <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> used to being outside. She was assigned to the Zhan Hu tribe in the first episode and quickly began quarreling with fellow contestant Dave Cruser. In the second episode, Massaro was voted off after six days with a 6–1 vote.|$|E
25|$|Rossakoff {{arrives at}} Poirot's flat. She happily confesses to Poirot that {{she put the}} jewels in the professor's pocket as she had found them in her own bag when the raid started, and so <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of them as quickly as she could. It was Varesco who planted them on her and she admits {{that he is the}} true owner of the premises. Poirot takes her into the next room where Higgs and Cerberus are waiting. Higgs can handle any dog and took the {{otherwise}} fierce animal out during the raid. Poirot asks Rossakoff to order the obedient dog to drop what it is holding in its mouth and it does so. A small sealed packet of cocaine drops to the ground. A shocked Rossakoff loudly proclaims her innocence and Poirot says he believes her – the true criminal is Alice who is in league with Verasco. She carried the drugs in her large skirt pockets and dropped them into her clients' pockets on the dance floor. When the raid occurred and the lights went out temporarily, Poirot was waiting by Cerberus and heard her put the packet in the dog's mouth – and Poirot took the opportunity to cut off a sample of cloth from her sleeve as proof.|$|E

2500|$|Hopper {{had tried}} to enlist in the Navy early in World War II. She was {{rejected}} for multiple reasons. At age 34, she {{was too old to}} enlist, and her weight to height ratio was too low. She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor at Vassar College was valuable to the war effort. During the war in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve; she was one of many women who volunteered to serve in the WAVES. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an exemption to enlist; she was [...] below the Navy minimum weight of [...] She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts.

Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.|$|E

It was an awful existence. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up of black winter's mornings to make breakfast for her scowling old father, who would have turned the whole house out of doors if his tea had not been ready at half-past eight.

At half-past nine he rose {{and went to the}} City, and she was almost free till dinner-time, to make visitations in the kitchen and to scold the servants; to drive abroad and descend upon the tradesmen, who were prodigiously respectful; to leave her cards and her papa's at the great glum respectable houses of their City friends; or to sit alone in the large drawing-room, expecting visitors; and working at a huge piece of worsted by the fire, on the sofa, hard by the great Iphigenia clock, which ticked and tolled with mournful loudness in the dreary room. The great glass over the mantelpiece, faced by the other great console glass {{at the opposite end of}} the room, increased and multiplied between them the brown Holland bag in which the chandelier hung, until you saw these brown Holland bags fading away in endless perspectives, and this apartment of Miss Osborne's seemed the centre of a system of drawing-rooms. When she removed the cordovan leather from the grand piano and ventured to play a few notes on it, it sounded with a mournful sadness, startling the dismal echoes of the house. George's picture was gone, and laid upstairs in a lumber-room in the garret; and though there was a consciousness of him, and father and daughter often instinctively knew that they were thinking of him, no mention was ever made of the brave and once darling son.|$|E
