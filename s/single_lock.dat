25|$|One {{striking}} {{difference in}} using a staircase of either type (compared with a <b>single</b> <b>lock,</b> or a flight) {{is the best}} sequence for letting boats through. In a <b>single</b> <b>lock</b> (or a flight with room for boats to pass) boats should ideally alternate in direction. In a staircase, however, it is quicker for a boat to follow a previous one going in the same direction. Partly for this reason staircase locks such as Grindley Brook, Foxton, Watford and Bratch are supervised by lockkeepers, at least during the main cruising season, they normally try to alternate as many boats up, followed by down as there are chambers in the flight.|$|E
25|$|Goodnight Rhonda Lee is Nicole Atkins’ fourth studio album, {{which was}} {{recorded}} at <b>Single</b> <b>Lock</b> Records in Fort Worth, Texas, {{was released on}} July 21, 2017. The first single off her record was “Goodnight Rhonda Lee” which is about her past behavior and finally putting it to rest. Her next single following “Goodnight Rhonda Lee” is “Listen Up.” In “Listen Up” Atkins is very self critical on how her life lessons were learned the hard way. She delivered her second single in a soulful/pop recording. Goodnight Rhonda Lee received an 83/100 score and 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E
25|$|Water usage is {{calculated}} per <b>single</b> <b>lock</b> cycle. It {{is determined by}} the water volume in a lock chamber between the levels it handles. Essentially, each cycle uses the volume of water discharged by the lock chamber (its width multiplied by its height and depth). When the locks are in stairs, as in the Panama Canal, only the first (highest) lock chamber matters for this calculation. None of the lower locks use additional water; they have the same volume. Moreover, the ship's underwater volume does not matter, because that volume is present {{both before and after the}} change in water level and thus is part of the non-moved volume.|$|E

25|$|Athlone is {{a popular}} stop for {{pleasure}} craft along the River Shannon. Lough Ree, the largest lake on the Shannon, is a short distance upstream from Athlone, and many boat companies are based out of the town. For craft to pass through Athlone, {{it is necessary to}} use a lock in the river, which beside the weir and downstream of the current road bridge. The lock, weir, and bridge were all constructed by the Shannon navigation commissioners in the 1840s. Before then, boats used a canal, about {{a mile and a half}} long, to the west of the river. The canal was built by Thomas Omer for the Commissioners of Inland Navigation. Work started in 1757 and involved the work of over 300 men. Omer built a <b>single</b> <b>lock,</b> 120′ X 19′ with a rise of 4.5′, but there was also a guard lock, further upstream, with a single set of gates to protect the canal against floods. There were also two lay-bys, or harbours, one above the lock and another at the upstream end. The old canal is no longer navigable.|$|E
500|$|Construction began {{once the}} {{necessary}} land had been purchased, {{but it soon}} {{became apparent that the}} original surveys were inadequate. The canal engineer John Rennie was asked to advise the proprietors, and proposed three options, for boats of , for boats of , and for barges which were [...] wide. The first was ruled out on cost, the third because of the need to transship all goods at Highbridge, and the second was adopted because it allowed the coasters that worked the Bristol Channel to use the canal. This option required locks of [...] by , and was costed at £28,720. The route would be as authorised, but a <b>single</b> <b>lock</b> was required on the upper section to simplify the water supply.

500|$|Although {{coal mining}} {{was one of}} the main reasons for the success of the navigation, it has also brought problems, caused by subsidence.

2500|$|The {{water used}} per lock {{operating}} cycle is therefore {{equal to the}} amount of water that flows into the first (upper) lock chamber when filling it from Gatun Lake. Reducing this volume requires reducing the chamber's width, length, or elevating height. Note that the elevating height has already been reduced by staging the total [...] elevation change into three locks. Were this change done in a <b>single</b> <b>lock</b> chamber, the water volume lost would be three times as much.|$|E

Starting from Devizes, {{there are four}} locks before the [...] Bruce tunnel, and another 31 locks before Newbury wharf, {{and the end of}} the first stage, is reached. Stage 2 contains 22 locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal, before the junction with the River Thames is reached, and a further six locks on the Thames, before the stage ends above Marlow lock. Stage 3 includes 14 locks, ending below Teddington lock, while stage 4 contains a <b>single</b> <b>lock</b> at Richmond before the final [...] on the tideway. Richmond lock is only operational at some states of the tide, and so a portage may be avoided if passage is made during a period of 2 hours either side of high tide.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "real" [...] {{staircase}} can {{be thought}} of as a [...] "compressed" [...] flight, where the intermediate pounds have disappeared, and the upper gate of one lock is also the lower gate of the one above it. However, it is incorrect to use the terms staircase and flight interchangeably: because of the absence of intermediate pounds, operating a staircase is very different from operating a flight. It can be more useful to think of a staircase as a <b>single</b> <b>lock</b> with intermediate levels (the top gate is a normal top gate, and the intermediate gates are all as tall as the bottom gate). As there is no intermediate pound, a chamber can only be filled by emptying the one above, or emptied by filling the one below: thus the whole staircase has to be full of water (except for the bottom chamber) before a boat starts to ascend, or empty (except for the top chamber) before a boat starts to descend. By building a pair of such lock sets (one used to climb and the other to descend) these difficulties are avoided, as well as enabling a greater traffic volume and reduced wait times.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{centerfire}} rifle cartridges, however, {{can generate}} pressures {{that may be}} too great for a <b>single</b> <b>locking</b> lug, {{if it is not}} stout enough. The Thompson Center Contender, for example, was limited to [...]30-30 Winchester level cartridges. To fire more powerful cartridges requires a much larger locking lug, such as that which Thomson Center used on the larger Encore model. By comparison, while bolt-action shotguns may only use a <b>single</b> <b>locking</b> lug, almost all bolt-action rifles use multiple locking lugs {{around the perimeter of the}} bolt to provide an even distribution of the forces of firing, giving a much higher intrinsic strength. Since many break open rifles, such as the inexpensive H&R models, are built on large frames originally meant for shotguns, the action is very heavily built and capable of handling moderate to high pressures. Still, belted magnum cartridges such as [...]300 Winchester Magnum are generally only found in the highest quality break action rifles.|$|R
2500|$|The {{mechanism}} was operated {{from the}} top level. For a descent, the box was first wound into its upper position using a double rack-and-pinion mechanism, then drawn tightly against {{the frame of the}} opening using a ratchet mounted {{on the top of the}} wall. The outer door was then drawn up with another rack-and-pinion. At this point the water levels in the top pound and inside the box would have been roughly equal, but as the inner door [...] – the box door – swung outwards horizontally (like a normal <b>single</b> <b>lock</b> gate) it would not open if the outer level was to any extent higher. A small equalising cock was therefore provided. The door was opened, the boat was floated in, the doors closed and the ratchet released. Because the entering boat would displace its weight of water back into the pound, the total weight of the box was always the same and no great endeavour was needed to wind it up and down. However, the operators could release a little water into the box to assist the descent. Water pressure against the outward-opening doors kept them firmly closed and watertight.|$|E
