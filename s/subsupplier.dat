50|$|By 1944 a large {{proportion}} of the American electronics industry concentrated on making the fuzes. Procurement contracts increased from $60 million in 1942, to $200 million in 1943, to $300 million in 1944 and were topped by $450 million in 1945. As volume increased, efficiency came into play and the cost per fuze fell from $732 in 1942 to $18 in 1945. This permitted the purchase of over 22 million fuzes for approximately one billion dollars. The main suppliers were Crosley, RCA, Eastman Kodak, McQuay-Norris and Sylvania. There were also over two thousand suppliers and <b>subsuppliers,</b> ranging from powder manufacturers to machine shops. It was among the first mass-production applications of printed circuits.|$|R

When {{and under what circumstances}} a company for example should be relationship orientated and when it should be transaction oriented, how relationships with <b>subsuppliers</b> are maintained and evaluated, and whether or not to extend its supplier cooperation. Due to first of all the IMP group, attention has been directed to the fact that many industrial companies are a part of more or less defined networks and that they have long-standing customer and supplier relationships. Various have emphasized that relationships do not last forever and that networks therefore change or dissolve. Circumstances may have changed by e. g. mergers, closures, or acquisitions. Factors in a company’s environment may also result in its relationships being ended because they are no longer advantageous. The fact that networks and relationships end has not invoked much attention in literature. It is, of course, relevant to analyse how companies build relationships and how they should act most appropriately, but one must also necessarily look at the process that leads to relationships being discontinued and networks being dissolved. How do the parties in the network react on dissolutio...|$|R
