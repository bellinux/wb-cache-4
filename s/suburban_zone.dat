40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{would like to}} {{concentrate}} on <b>suburban</b> <b>zones</b> of Pardubice and their relation to resident centre. The town of Pardubice, where I live, contains a positive attitude towards expansion of housing development and expandation of <b>suburban</b> <b>zones.</b> The objective of my work is the investigation of this sphere from several points. I would concentrate on inland and abroad investors, who situate their business subjects into these zones. Also I would study flowing of inhabitants structure, migration trends and their relation to resident centre. Main influence on territory expansion plays Army airport (it turns into civil airport), presence of railway speed corridor and completion of speedway D 11 from Hradec Králové to Prague. Policy of territorial development talks about building up river port on the river Elbe in Pardubice. Not least I would solve an influence of territorial enlarging of the town on original municipalitites and effects which this activity brings. The main direction of my work will be focusing on <b>suburban</b> <b>zones,</b> their positive and negative consequences for the town of Pardubice...|$|R
40|$|The most {{challenging}} processes {{to be investigated}} further which are occurring in residential areas, suburbs in the largest Belarusian cities have been determined and systematized in the paper. The paper considers modern processes of transformation and development of residential areas on the studied territories; ongoing changes in the typology of dwellings and inhabitant composition of the suburban zones; problems pertaining to infrastructure development of suburban territories; preservation and improvement of recreational and ecological functions of the <b>suburban</b> <b>zones</b> in the largest cities. The paper presents a hypothesis on the possibility to modernize an urbanized region while using digital technologies and it also provides architectural and artistic characteristics of the residential environment. The main research methods are the following: field surveys; analysis of statistical data, project and regulatory documentation. So it has been revealed {{that it is necessary}} to carry out a detailed study of inhabitant composition in the settlements in order to determine their actual requirements in schools, kindergartens, and other facilities of public services. Development of town planning regulations taking into account actual typology of residential buildings and inhabitant composition is required for organization of suburban areas in the largest Belarusian cities. Current transformation processes of traditional settlement in the <b>suburban</b> <b>zones</b> of large cities are in need to have new requirements to their infrastructure development. It is necessary to improve a monitoring system and respond to population requirements and emerging problems. Nowadays there are conditions for formation of active population communities on the suburban territories. It is necessary to execute a coordinated development of all forms and types of <b>suburban</b> <b>zones</b> in the largest cities. The paper recommends to form, develop and preserve landscape and recreational areas in order to ensure an efficient recreational and ecological functions of the <b>suburban</b> <b>zones.</b> </p...|$|R

50|$|In 1954, Metropolitan Toronto ("Metro") was created, {{covering}} the whole present {{area of the}} City of Toronto. The TTC took on responsibility for transit within the entire area. A flat fare was {{not considered to be}} feasible for so large an area; so the TTC created the Central Zone, which roughly incorporated the City of Toronto, and set up a series of concentric semicircular rings around it as <b>Suburban</b> <b>Zone</b> 1, 2, etc., with an additional fare required for each one. Routes extending beyond the Metro limit continued to be separate radial routes, so the zones still had the effect of fare stages, but, within Metro, it became possible to change buses within a suburban zone.This external link shows a route map of this period. The (roughly rectangular) Metro limit is not marked on the map, but <b>Suburban</b> <b>Zone</b> 2 extends to just reach this limit in the north and the southwest only; the Port Credit bus and part of the North Yonge bus are the only TTC routes then extending outside Metro.|$|E

50|$|ZTM {{tickets are}} valid on city and {{suburban}} bus lines, {{as well as}} trams, Metro, and SKM. Some ZTM tickets are also valid on the WKD and Mazovian Railroads, but only within the city or <b>suburban</b> <b>zone.</b> A given ticket costs the same price within one zone, but if a passenger passes the zone limit, it costs double. Tickets are best bought at newsagents and at ticket machines at various high traffic areas. Additionally, they can often be bought from drivers on trams and buses, {{but this is not}} guaranteed. ZTM tickets are invalid on PKS suburban and intercity buses and private companies that do not operate within the ZTM scheme.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the best-known}} areas of Naucalpan is Ciudad Satélite with its {{signature}} Torres de Satélite sculpture. Ciudad Satélite {{was one of a}} number of large scale projects undertaken by the federal government in the Mexico City area in the 1950s and 1960s, along with the Conjunto Habitacional de Tlaltelolco and the Ciudad Universitaria. [...] From the late 1940s to early 1950s, Mexico City began to grow towards the northern limits of the Federal District, and compelling urbanization into adjoining Mexico State. One of the projects conceived for the <b>suburban</b> <b>zone</b> of Naucalpan was a development called Ciudad Satélite. The project was headed by architect Luis Barragán in 1958 and financially backed the Banco Internacional Hipotecario. [...] The city’s design and coordination was supervised by architect Mario Pani. It was designed to be a suburban community with a “green corridor” (highway lined by parks) connecting it to Mexico City proper. Attractive land prices created a boom market soon after the first units were sold in the mid 1960s, and over the next ten years, the green corridor disappeared. In addition to being a major bedroom community, it has been a major shopping district since the opening of the Centro Comercial Satélite in 1962.|$|E
40|$|The {{disparity}} of accessibility between {{cars and}} public transit provides important {{information about the}} degree of auto orientation in urban spatial structure. Using 1990 and 2000 spatial data and a geographical information system (GIS), the present study examined the degrees and spatial variations of accessibility disparity between commuting by car and public transit {{as well as the}} temporal changes in this disparity in the metropolitan areas of Boston and San Francisco. In both metropolitan areas there was a considerable disparity in job accessibility in a comparison between users of cars and public transit, which turned out to differ substantially by location. Between 1990 and 2000, regional levels of this accessibility disparity lessened in the two metropolitan areas, but the temporal changes in the accessibility disparity varied considerably among different locations within the metropolitan areas. The accessibility disparity decreased in the majority of central areas and in a number of <b>suburban</b> <b>zones</b> near rail stations, whereas the accessibility disparity increased in a number of <b>suburban</b> <b>zones</b> near major highways. Improving accessibility for public transit, relative to that for cars, should be a key strategy for redressing auto-oriented urban spatial structure, an important objective of sustainable development. 1...|$|R

[...] The <b>suburban</b> <b>zones,</b> which during the Roman Age had grown along the most important roads of the area, were depopulated; the lower parts of the city were abandoned; vegetation gradually took possession of several spaces, substantiated by the fact that, in the 10th century, an inner zone of Anagni was marked by the place-name Civitas Vetus (Old Town).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe peak-concentration {{times of}} air qualityindicators, {{reflecting}} transportation activity, were investigated using multilevel model at five ambient-air-quality monitoring stations in Surabaya, Indonesia. It was conducted from 2001 to 2002. It aimed to obtain {{spatial and temporal}} factors that affect the peak-concentration time. The results obtainedare helpful for picturing traffic congestion in each zone using air-quality-monitoring data (i. e., NO concentrations). Spatially, {{it was found that}} congestion occurred later in the morning in <b>suburban</b> <b>zones</b> than in the three other zones (e. g., 55 and 14 min later than in the city center) and 16 and 57 min earlier in the evening in the <b>suburban</b> <b>zones</b> than in the city center, suggesting tendency of delayed departure and earlier return on the suburban. In terms of season, for instance, in the highway zone, the peak time in the morning was as much as 9 min earlier in the dry season than in the wet season, and the peak time in the evening was 17. 5 min later in the dry season than in the wet season. This suggests that traffic congestion occurred {{over a longer period of}} the day during the dry season. Day-to-day variation did not significantly affect the peak times. However on Sunday, the peak times in morning and evening are lowest and highest for all zones. This might be due to family-related activities, such as leisure and recreational activities. The full model did not marksignificant improvement over the null model, meaning that more variables need to be incorporated to explain the variability of the peak time...|$|R

Their phisical urban {{structures}} as well as their development in time and processes witch affects these changes. Despite that a different european countries has different systems of spatial planning, they allwys have three main levels of planning process. These layers are: Strategic planning, regulation level and execution level. What differs is tunig of this system and wights of importance set on different „layers“. This tuning has a substential impact on way how are the cities and urban structures developer. This tuning of spatial planning systém has huge impact on physical structure and form of cities. Every setting of system brings differnt possibilities of solving problems. In both schort-term and long-term development processes. This thesis will therefore examine affects of different settings of spatial planning system in Czech Republic and Federal Republic of Germany (In specific terms – Free state of Bavaria, region of Upper Palatinate) and its long-term afffects on phisical structure of cities. With empahsis on ways in which historical village structures integrate in city structure and transform in cities districts. Goal of thesis is effort to analyse results of these two spatial planning systems. And mainly in <b>suburban</b> <b>zones</b> affected by development axes of bigger cities. Thesis will compare urban and suburban structures of two cities in two different countries. Analysed example for Czech republic is Brno. As Bavarian example stands Regensburg (as a city of comparable structure). One of important criteria is ability of systéms to effectively capture and use all of territorys development potential and possibiliteis and therefore – ability to create viable and susteinable land systems. In suburban spaces where City systems meets suburban and village systems is intensive use of existing structures and active work with subcenters crutial to susteinable development of cities...|$|R
40|$|Settlements Morphology {{within the}} <b>suburban</b> <b>zone</b> of Prague This bachelor's thesis {{works on the}} topic of {{settlements}} morphology and structure of suburban landscape. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} measure and explain the changes in morphology of settlements in <b>suburban</b> <b>zone</b> of Prague after 1990. The paper shows that the morphology of post-socialist city hinterland is very specific and for this reason we specify the concept of urban sprawl into a form valid for post-socialist city. This concept is operationalized into three dimensions: settlement density, settlement structure and land-use pattern. The main benefit of this paper is the measure of urban sprawl itself and the surveillance of its evolution between 2007 and 2016. This paper shows that the evolution of urban sprawl is paradoxical in some ways and so it doesn't correspond to the general discourse about effects of suburbanisation. We explore urban sprawl on the level of urban region and two municipalities (Modletice, Ohrobec) where we focus on the particular effects and development participants. Key words: morphology, urban sprawl, suburbanisation, Prague urban regio...|$|E
40|$|Political {{changes in}} Slovakia after 1989 {{initiated}} new economic trends which significantly affected {{the structure of}} cities and rural municipalities. The process of suburbanization has changed the rural landscape with a widespread increase in new residential areas.
