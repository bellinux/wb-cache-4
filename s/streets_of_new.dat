5|$|Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after walking down the <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York and seeing several stone gargoyles on the corner, staring at him. Gordon developed the concept with series creator Chris Carter, who suggested the addition of more psychological aspects to the episode. Originally, the teaser was planned to be filmed at a Catholic hospital, but the shot was relocated {{to the site of}} a historic post office after concerns were raised about attaching a fake gargoyle to the building.|$|E
5|$|On Speechless, Frith {{continued}} his exploration of world folk and dance music {{that he had}} begun on Gravity, but unlike Gravity, Speechless included extensive use of found sounds and field recordings.

Recordings were also made while visiting friends: the title song's rhythm track is provided by a malfunctioning water pipe in Tim Hodgkinson's kitchen.|$|E

5|$|After the March 1976 coup, Berni {{moved to}} New York City, where he {{continued}} painting, engraving, collaging and exhibiting. New York {{struck him as}} luxurious, consumerist, materially wealthy and spiritually poor. He conveyed these observations in subsequent work {{with a touch of}} social irony. His New York paintings display a great protagonism of color and include Aeropuerto (Airport), Los Hippies, Calles de Nueva York (<b>Streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York), Almuerzo (Lunch), Chelsea Hotel and Promesa de castidad (Promise of Chastity). He also produced several decorative panels, scenographic sketches, illustrations, and collaborations for books.|$|E
5|$|June 12, 1899, {{was the day}} of the Gollmar Brothers Circus, {{which drew}} {{hundreds}} of visitors in addition to the town's 1,800 inhabitants. Around 3:00p.m., clouds began to build, and the sky became quite dark. As the circus ended for the day around 4:30 PM, a heavy rain, with some hail, began to fall. The rain let up around 5:00 PM, and people began to head home for the day. By 6:00 PM, the <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Richmond were full of tourists, travelers and residents.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 08:46:40 local time. Countless people in the <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York City witnessed the strike, but few video recordings captured the moment. Documentary film maker Jules Naudet captured the only known footage of the initial impact from start to finish. Before the hijacking was confirmed, news agencies began {{to report on the}} incident and speculated that the crash had been an accident. The impact and subsequent fire caused the North Tower to collapse 102minutes after the crash, resulting in hundreds of additional casualties. During the recovery effort at the World Trade Center site, workers recovered and identified dozens of remains from Flight11 victims, but many body fragments could not be identified.|$|E

5|$|When the Spanish–American War broke out, Savage {{volunteered to}} lead men in battle. Instead, {{he was given}} command of an {{engineering}} unit which then built a complete base in Havana. Returning to New York, he wrote more books and corresponded with his wife who traveled often to the Russian Empire to visit their daughter and her Russian husband. Four years after mustering out of the Army, Savage was knocked down and mortally wounded {{at the age of}} 57 by a horse and carriage on the <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York.|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Gordon {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the episode while he was walking down the <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York and noticed several stone gargoyles on the corner staring at him. Gordon developed the idea into an X-File involving possession by a gargoyle spirit. He wrote a draft script for the episode but had to turn to series creator Chris Carter three days before production began in order to rework it. The two worked on the script over the weekend to add more psychological aspects to the episode. Gordon claimed to be very proud of the final product. Assistant Art Director Gary Allen drew the gargoyle sketches used in this episode.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Hang 'Em High, Eastwood had already begun working on Coogan's Bluff, about an Arizona deputy sheriff {{tracking}} a wanted psychopathic criminal (Don Stroud) through the <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York City. He was reunited with Universal Studios for it after receiving an offer of $1million—more than double his previous salary. Jennings Lang arranged for Eastwood to meet Don Siegel, a Universal contract director who later became Eastwood's close friend, forming a partnership that would last {{more than ten years}} and produce five films. Shooting began in November 1967, before the script had been finalized. The film was controversial for its portrayal of violence. Coogan's Bluff also became the first collaboration with Argentine composer Lalo Schifrin, who would later compose the jazzy score to several Eastwood films in the 1970s and 1980s, including the Dirty Harry films.|$|E

5|$|Having just {{completed}} one such patrol in May 1976, {{the ship was}} notified {{that she would be}} participating in an International Naval Review in New York City as part of the United States Bicentennial celebrations, the first South African warship to visit the United States. President Kruger departed Simon's Town on 3 June, sailing via Walvis Bay, Abidjan and Las Palmas to Norfolk, Virginia. From there, she sailed in a fleet of 53 warships from 22 countries to New York City for the Naval Review on 4 July. On 6 July, members of the ship's company paraded through the <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York, after which she sailed home to Simonstown via Charleston, South Carolina and Las Palmas. The future politician, Lance Corporal Tony Leon, was the official photographer for this journey.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{started on}} September 6, 2004 at Camperdown Studios in Miramar, New Zealand. Camperdown housed the native village and the Great Wall, while the <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York City were constructed on its backlot and at Gracefield in Lower Hutt, New Zealand. The {{majority of the}} SS Venture scenes were shot aboard a full-scale deck constructed {{in the parking lot}} at Camperdown Studio and then were backed with a green screen, with the ocean digitally added in post. Scenes set in the Broadway theater from which King Kong makes his escape were filmed in Wellington's Opera House and at the Auckland Civic Theatre. Filming also took place at Stone Street Studios, where a new sound stage was constructed to accommodate one of the sets. Over the course of filming the budget went from $175 million to $207 million over additional visual effects work needed, and Jackson extending the film's running time by thirty minutes. Jackson covered the $32 million surplus himself and finished filming in March 2005.|$|E
5|$|Shastri's assurances {{calmed down}} the {{volatile}} situation. On 12 February, the students council postponed the agitation indefinitely and on 16 February, C. Subramaniam and O. V. Alagesan withdrew their resignations. Sporadic acts of protests and violence continued to happen throughout February and early March. On 7 March, the administration withdrew {{all the cases}} filed against the student leaders and on 14 March, the Anti-Hindi imposition Agitation Council dropped the agitation. Shastri's climbdown angered the pro-Hindi activists in North India. Members of Jan Sangh went about the <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Delhi, blackening out English signs with tar. The agitation slowly changed into a general anti-Congress organisation. In the 1967 election, student leader P. Seenivasan contested against Kamaraj in the Virudhunagar constituency. A large number of students {{from all over the}} state campaigned for him and ensured his victory: the Congress party was defeated and DMK came to power {{for the first time in}} Madras State.|$|E

5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Danielle Federici, was filmed {{during the early}} summer of 1994. It was filmed in black-and-white, and features Carey walking along the <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York, watching several different people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, lonely {{and in need of}} a friend. Additionally, aside from several scenes of Carey and a large church choir in a large antechamber, the video is known as the first video in which Carey appears with straightened hair. Throughout her career up until that point, Carey had famously sported long, auburn curls. However, the video presented Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with bangs and a long straightened hairstyle. The video begins with scenes of Carey walking down a long New York street, with the addition of close ups of Carey's face. As she stares down the road, she witnesses a small girl, sitting alone in an alley corner, glaring into the sky. As the first chorus begins, Carey enters a large foyer, with a choir dressed in black singing perched atop a large staircase. During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who is sitting on a withered stoop.|$|E
5|$|The video {{progresses}} as Carey, {{now on the}} <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York, {{is walking}} towards the hotel. As she begins to notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins jolting {{back to the hotel}} while holding several shopping bags. Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights around a large photo of her. As the video comes to an end, she waits for her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting to take a picture of her. She then looks directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting to take a picture, right before a bus hits him. Carey gasps in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table. As Gucci Mane stands next to her in a white suit, he pours her champagne and hands her the glass.|$|E
