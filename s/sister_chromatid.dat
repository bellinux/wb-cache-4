5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E
25|$|When a cell enters in mitosis, it duplicates all {{the genetic}} {{information}} {{stored in the}} chromosomes, in the process termed DNA replication. At {{the end of this}} process, each chromosome includes two sister chromatids, which are two complete and identical DNA molecules. Both chromatids remain associated by cohesin complexes until anaphase, when chromosome segregation occurs. If chromosome segregation happens correctly, each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromatids, and for this to happen each <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> has to anchor (through the corresponding kinetochore) to MTs generated in opposed poles of the mitotic spindle. This configuration is termed amphitelic or bi-orientation.|$|E
50|$|Cohesin is {{a protein}} complex that regulates the {{separation}} of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> during cell division, either mitosis or meiosis. Cohesins hold <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> together after DNA replication until anaphase when removal of cohesin leads to separation of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rec8 is a meiosis-specific {{component}} of the cohesin complex that binds <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> {{in preparation for the}} two divisions of meiosis. Rec8 is sequentially removed from <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids.</b> It is removed from the arms of chromosomes in the first division - separating homologous chromosomes from each other. However, Rec8 is maintained at centromeres so that <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> are kept joined until anaphase of meiosis II, at which point removal of remaining cohesin leads to the separation of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids.</b>|$|R

Chromosome {{line up in}} {{the middle}} plane, the mitotic spindle forms and the kinetochores of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> attach to the microtubules. Right: Anaphase of mitosis, where <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> {{separate}} and the microtubules pull them in opposite directions. The chromosome shown in red fails to separate properly, its <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> stick together and get pulled to the same side, resulting in mitotic nondisjunction of this chromosome.|$|R
25|$|During mitosis, microtubules {{grow from}} centrosomes located at {{opposite}} ends of the cell and also attach to the centromere at specialized structures called kinetochores, one of which is present on each <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid.</b> A special DNA base sequence in the region of the kinetochores provides, along with special proteins, longer-lasting attachment in this region. The microtubules then pull the chromatids apart toward the centrosomes, so that each daughter cell inherits one set of chromatids. Once the cells have divided, the chromatids are uncoiled and DNA can again be transcribed. In spite of their appearance, chromosomes are structurally highly condensed, which enables these giant DNA structures to be contained within a cell nucleus.|$|E
500|$|In eukaryotes, {{two primary}} models for how {{homologous}} recombination repairs double-strand breaks in DNA are the double-strand break repair (DSBR) pathway (sometimes called the double Holliday junction model) and the synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) pathway. In {{the case of}} double strand breakage, the 3' end is degraded and the longer 5' end invades the contiguous <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid,</b> forming a replication bubble. As this bubble nears the broken DNA, the longer 5' antisense strand again invades the sense strand of this portion of DNA, transcribing a second copy. When replication ends, both tails are reconnected to form two Holliday Junctions, which are then cleaved {{in a variety of}} patterns by proteins. An animation of this process can be seen [...]|$|E
500|$|The RPA protein, {{which has}} high {{affinity}} for single-stranded DNA, then binds the 3' overhangs. [...] With {{the help of}} several other proteins that mediate the process, the Rad51 protein (and Dmc1, in meiosis) then forms a filament of nucleic acid and protein on the single strand of DNA coated with RPA. [...] This nucleoprotein filament then begins searching for DNA sequences {{similar to that of}} the 3' overhang. [...] After finding such a sequence, the single-stranded nucleoprotein filament moves into (invades) the similar or identical recipient DNA duplex in a process called strand invasion. [...] In cells that divide through mitosis, the recipient DNA duplex is generally a <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid,</b> which is identical to the damaged DNA molecule and provides a template for repair. [...] In meiosis, however, the recipient DNA tends to be from a similar but not necessarily identical homologous chromosome. [...] A displacement loop (D-loop) is formed during strand invasion between the invading 3' overhang strand and the homologous chromosome. After strand invasion, a DNA polymerase extends the end of the invading 3' strand by synthesizing new DNA. [...] This changes the D-loop to a cross-shaped structure known as a Holliday junction. Following this, more DNA synthesis occurs on the invading strand (i.e., one of the original 3' overhangs), effectively restoring the strand on the homologous chromosome that was displaced during strand invasion.|$|E
25|$|Nondisjunction is {{the failure}} of {{homologous}} chromosomes or <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> to separate properly during cell division. There are three forms of nondisjunction: failure {{of a pair of}} homologous chromosomes to separate in meiosis I, failure of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> to separate during meiosis II, and failure of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> to separate during mitosis. Nondisjunction results in daughter cells with abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploidy).|$|R
40|$|Background: Homologous {{chromosomes}} separate in meiosis I and <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> separate in meiosis II, generating haploid gametes. To {{address the}} question why <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> do not separate in meiosis I, we explored the roles of Shogoshin 1 (Sgo 1) in chromosome separation during oocyte meiosis. Methodology/Principal Findings: Sgo 1 function was evaluated by exogenous overexpression to enhance its roles and RNAi to suppress its roles during two meioses of mouse oocytes. Immunocytochemistry and chromosome spread were used to evaluate phenotypes. The exogenous Sgo 1 overexpression kept homologous chromosomes and <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> not to separate in meiosis I and meiosis II, respectively, while the Sgo 1 RNAi promoted premature separation of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids.</b> Conclusions: Our results reveal that prevention of premature separation of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> in meiosis I requires th...|$|R
50|$|This is {{followed}} by anaphase II, in which the remaining centromeric cohesin is cleaved allowing the <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> to segregate. The <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> by convention are now called sister chromosomes as they move toward opposing poles.|$|R
2500|$|During mitosis, each <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> {{forming the}} {{complete}} chromosome {{has its own}} kinetochore. Distinct sister kinetochores can be observed at first {{at the end of}} G2 phase in cultured mammalian cells. These early kinetochores show a mature laminar structure before the nuclear envelope breaks down (reviewed by Pluta et al. in 1995). The molecular pathway for kinetochore assembly in higher eukaryotes has been studied using gene knockouts in mice and in cultured chicken cells, as well as using RNA interference (RNAi) in ...|$|E
2500|$|During the {{synthesis}} phase (S phase) {{in the cell}} cycle, the centrosome starts to duplicate. Just {{at the beginning of}} mitosis, both centrioles in each centrosome reach their maximal length, centrosomes recruit additional material and their nucleation capacity for microtubules increases. As mitosis progresses, both centrosomes separate to establish the mitotic spindle. In this way, the spindle in a mitotic cell has two poles emanating microtubules. Microtubules are long proteic filaments with asymmetric extremes, a [...] "minus"(-) end [...] relatively stable next to the centrosome, and a [...] "plus"(+) end [...] enduring alternate phases of growing-shrinking, exploring the center of the cell. During this searching process, a microtubule may encounter and capture a chromosome through the kinetochore. Microtubules that find and attach a kinetochore become stabilized, whereas those microtubules remaining free are rapidly depolymerized. As chromosomes have two kinetochores associated back-to-back (one on each <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid),</b> when one of them becomes attached to the microtubules generated by one of the cellular poles, the kinetochore on the <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> becomes exposed to the opposed pole; for this reason, most of the times the second kinetochore becomes attached to the microtubules emanating from the opposing pole, {{in such a way that}} chromosomes are now bi-oriented, one fundamental configuration (also termed amphitelic) to ensure the correct segregation of both chromatids when the cell will divide.|$|E
2500|$|Ovulated eggs become {{arrested in}} {{metaphase}} II until fertilization triggers the second meiotic division. [...] Similar to the segregation events of mitosis, the pairs of sister chromatids {{resulting from the}} separation of bivalents in meiosis I are further separated in anaphase of meiosis II. In oocytes, one <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> is segregated into the second polar body, while the other stays inside the egg. During spermatogenesis, each meiotic division is symmetric such that each primary spermatocyte gives rise to 2 secondary spermatocytes after meiosis I, and eventually 4 spermatids after meiosis II. [...] Meiosis II-nondisjunction may also result in aneuploidy syndromes, but only to a much smaller extent than do segregation failures in meiosis I.|$|E
50|$|Since {{homologous}} chromosomes are not identical {{and do not}} originate from the same organism, they are different from <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids.</b> <b>Sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> result after DNA replication has occurred, and thus are identical, side-by-side duplicates of each other.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{paternal}} (blue) chromosomal and {{the maternal}} (pink) chromosome are homologous chromosomes. Following chromosomal replication, the blue chromosome {{is composed of}} two identical <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> and the pink chromosome is composed of two identical <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids.</b> In mitosis, the <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> separate into the daughter cells, but are now referred to as chromosomes (rather than chromatids) {{much in the way}} that one child is not referred to as a single twin.|$|R
2500|$|The {{kinetochore}} ( [...] , [...] ) is {{a protein}} structure on chromatids where the spindle fibers attach during cell division to pull <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> apart.

2500|$|Arsenic is {{reported}} to cause DNA modifications such as aneuploidy, micronuclei formation, chromosome abnormality, deletion mutations, <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> exchange and crosslinking of DNA with proteins. It has been demonstrated that arsenic does not directly interact with DNA and it is considered a poor mutagen, but instead, it helps mutagenicity of other carcinogens. For instance, a synergistic increase in the mutagenic activity of arsenic with UV light has been observed in human and other mammalian cells after exposing the UV-treated cells to arsenic. A series of experimental observations suggest that the arsenic genotoxicity is primarily linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during its biotransformation. The ROS production is able to generate DNA adducts, DNA strand breaks, crosslinks and chromosomal aberrations. The oxidative damage is caused by modification of DNA nucleobases, in particular 8-oxoguanine (8-OHdG) which leads to G:C to T:A [...] mutations. Inorganic arsenic can also cause DNA strand break even at low concentrations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> {{exchange}} (SCE) is {{the exchange}} of genetic information between two sister chromatids. SCEs can occur during mitosis or meiosis.

40|$|SummaryKinetochores of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> {{attach to}} microtubules {{emanating from the}} same pole (coorientation) during meiosis I and microtubules emanating from {{opposite}} poles (biorientation) during meiosis II. We find that the Aurora B kinase Ipl 1 regulates kinetochore-microtubule attachment during both meiotic divisions and that a complex known as the monopolin complex ensures that the protein kinase coorients <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> during meiosis I. Furthermore, the defining of conditions sufficient to induce sister kinetochore coorientation during mitosis provides insight into monopolin complex function. The monopolin complex joins sister kinetochores independently of cohesins, the proteins that hold <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> together. We propose that this function of the monopolin complex helps Aurora B coorient <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> during meiosis I...|$|R
2500|$|Division of {{somatic cells}} through mitosis is preceded by {{replication}} {{of the genetic}} material in S phase. As a result, each chromosome consists of two <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> held together at the centromere. In the anaphase of mitosis, <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> separate and migrate to opposite cell poles before the cell divides. Nondisjunction during mitosis leads to one daughter receiving both <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> of the affected chromosome while the other gets none.

50|$|Establishment of {{cohesion}} {{refers to}} {{the process by which}} chromatin-associated cohesin becomes cohesion-competent. Chromatin association of cohesin is not sufficient for cohesion. Cohesin must undergo subsequent modification ("establishment") to be capable of physically holding the sister chromosomes together. Though cohesin can associate with chromatin earlier in the cell cycle, cohesion is established during S phase. Early data suggesting that S phase is crucial to cohesion was {{based on the fact that}} after S phase, <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> are always found in the bound state. Tying establishment to DNA replication allows the cell to institute cohesion as soon as the <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> are formed. This solves the problem of how the cell might properly identify and pair <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> by ensuring that the <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> are never separate once replication has occurred.|$|R
40|$|Connections between {{chromosomes}} {{are essential}} for their accurate segregation during cell division. In somatic cells dividing by mitosis, newly replicated <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> are connected by cohesin proteins. When the <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> become attached to microtubules emanating from opposite poles of the spindle, cohesins resist the pulling forces and the ensuing tension stabilizes the chromatid–microtubule attachments. In this way, each pair of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> achieves a stable bipolar attachment to the spindle. Consequently, when cohesion is destroyed {{at the onset of}} anaphase, <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> are pulled to opposite poles and each new cell receives a full complement of maternal and paternal chromosomes.

The cell cycle surveillance mechanism that prevents sister-chromatid separation and transition into anaphase is called the spindle checkpoint. As a safeguard against chromosome segregation errors, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) delays anaphase until all <b>sister</b> <b>chromatid</b> pairs have become bipolarly attached.|$|E

40|$|Aurora-B kinases are {{important}} regulators of mitotic chromosome segregation, {{where they are}} required for the faithful bi-orientation of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids.</b> In contrast to mitosis, <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> have to be oriented toward the same spindle pole in meiosis-I, while homologous chromosomes are bi-oriented. We find that the fission yeast Aurora kinase Ark 1 {{is required for the}} faithful bi-orientation of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> in mitosis and of homologous chromosomes in meiosis-I. Unexpectedly, Ark 1 is also necessary for the faithful mono-orientation of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> in meiosis-I, even though the canonical mono-orientation pathway, which depends on Moa 1 and Rec 8, seems intact. Our data suggest that Ark 1 prevents unified sister kinetochores during metaphase-I from merotelic attachment to both spindle poles and thus from being torn apart during anaphase-I, revealing a novel mechanism promoting monopolar attachment. Furthermore, our results provide an explanation for the previously enigmatic observation that fission yeast Shugoshin Sgo 2, which assists in loading Aurora to centromeres, and its regulator Bub 1 are required for the mono-orientation of <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> in meiosis-I...|$|R
50|$|The BFB cycle {{begins when}} the end region of a {{chromosome}}, called its telomere, breaks off. When that chromosome subsequently replicates it forms two <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> which both lack a telomere. Since telomeres {{appear at the}} end of chromatids, and function to prevent their ends from fusing with other chromatids, the lack of a telomere on these two <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> causes them to fuse with one another. During anaphase the <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> will form a bridge where the centromere in one of the <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> will be pulled in one direction of the dividing cell, while the centromere of the other will be pulled in the opposite direction. Being pulled in opposite directions will cause the two <b>sister</b> <b>chromatids</b> to break apart from each other, but not necessarily at the site that they fused. This results in the two daughter cells receiving an uneven chromatid. Since the two resulting chromatids lack telomeres, when they replicate the BFB cycle will repeat, and will continue every subsequent cell division until those chromatids receive a telomere, usually from a different chromatid through the process of translocation.|$|R
