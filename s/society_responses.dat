40|$|This {{research}} has been aimed at identifying internally consistent and plausible narratives on the pathways of <b>society’s</b> <b>response</b> to climate change. In this research, <b>society’s</b> <b>response</b> to climate change has been interpreted as the emergence of climate change mitigation action by <b>society.</b> Studying <b>society’s</b> <b>response</b> to climate change is hampered by two main factors. First, the dynamics of <b>society’s</b> <b>response</b> to climate change are emergent and complex, as mitigation action arises out of the actions and interactions of the many actors in <b>society.</b> Second, <b>society’s</b> <b>response</b> to climate change is subject to many uncertainties. Agent-based modelling (ABM) {{has been identified as}} an appropriate method to get insight into the complexity and emergence of <b>society’s</b> <b>response</b> to climate change. Exploratory Modelling and Analysis (EMA) has been identified of a suitable approach to gain insight into the consequences of the uncertainties influencing <b>society’s</b> <b>response</b> to climate change.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{considers}} the recent experience {{of civil society}} organizations in Nicaragua within the Poverty Reduction Strategies Papers (PRSP) process. The focus of the paper is not the poverty reduction strategy itself but rather civil <b>society</b> <b>responses</b> to this initiative in Nicaragua. It highlights the problems beginning to emerge within this process {{in relation to the}} World Bank–IMF, the national government and organized civil society. Fundamental to the conceptu-alization and design of PRSP is the idea of ‘national ownership ’ facilitated by wide consultation and participation of civil society in the formulation and evaluation of individual country strategies. This paper uses Nicaragua’s PRSP process to examine the extent to which organized civil society can really influence PRSP formulation. It highlights the differences that exist in how poverty is defined and discussed by the key actors and examines civil society’s response to government proposals and the strategies they have adopted to promote an ‘alternative ’ people-centred development perspective...|$|E
40|$|Developing model-based {{narratives}} of <b>society’s</b> <b>response</b> {{to climate change}} is challenged by two factors. First, <b>society’s</b> <b>response</b> to possible future climate change is subject to many uncertainties. Second, we argue that society’s mitigation action emerge out of the actions and interactions of the many actors in society. Together, these two factors imply that the overarching dynamics of <b>society’s</b> <b>response</b> to climate change are unpredictable. In contrast to conventional processes of developing scenarios, in this study the emergence of climate change mitigation action by society has been represented in an agent-based model with which we developed two {{narratives of}} the emergence of climate change mitigation action by applying exploratory modelling and analysis. The agent-based model represents a two-level game involving governments and citizens changing their emission behaviour in the face of climate change through mitigation action. Insights gained from the exploration on uncertainties pertaining to the system have been used to construct two internally consistent and plausible narratives on the pathways {{of the emergence of}} mitigation action, which, as we argue, are a reasonable summary of the uncertainty space. The first narrative highlights how and when strong mitigation action emerges while the second narrative highlights how and when weak mitigation action emerges. In contrast to a conventional scenario development process, these two scenarios have been discovered bottom up rather than being defined top down. They succinctly capture the possible outcomes of the emergence of climate change mitigation by society across a large range of uncertain factors. The narratives therefore help in conveying the consequences of the various uncertainties influencing the emergence of climate change mitigation action by society. </p...|$|R

40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of terrorist attacks in 1998 and 2002, Kenya has come under pressure from aid donors and diplomatic circles to co-operate in achieving the political and military objectives of the War on Terror. The Kenyan government has received legal, {{technical and financial support}} to implement new counter-terrorism structures. However, while these have raised concerns around human rights and the ability of people to come together and organize on shared interests, the response of civil society in Kenya has been muted. It is mainly human rights campaigners, lawyers, Muslim organizations and leaders, and some politicians that have opposed proposed anti-terrorism legislation. Even fewer groups have spoken out against the government's participation in a regional rendition programme in the Horn of Africa supported by the United States. This weak response reflects the significant ethnic and regional fragmentation that prevails in the country.

40|$|Introduction: Increasingly, HIV-seropositive {{individuals}} cross international borders. HIV-related {{restrictions on}} entry, stay, and residence imposed by countries have important consequences for this mobile population. Our {{aim was to}} describe the geographical distribution of countries with travel restrictions and to examine the trends and characteristics of countries with such restrictions. Methods: In 2011, data presented to UNAIDS were used to establish a list of countries with and without HIV restrictions on entry, stay, and residence and to describe their geographical distribution. The following indicators were investigated to describe the country characteristics: population at mid-year, international migrants {{as a percentage of}} the population, Human Development Index, estimated HIV prevalence (age: 15 &#x 2013; 49), presence of a policy prohibiting HIV screening for general employment purposes, government and civil <b>society</b> <b>responses</b> to having non-discrimination laws/regulations which specify migrants/mobile populations, government and civil <b>society</b> <b>responses</b> to having laws/regulations/policies that present obstacles to effective HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support for migrants/mobile populations, Corruption Perception Index, and gross national income per capita. Results: HIV-related restrictions exist in 45 out of 193 WHO countries (23 %) in all regions of the world. We found that the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific Regions have the highest proportions of countries with these restrictions. Our analyses showed that countries that have opted for restrictions have the following characteristics: smaller populations, higher proportions of migrants in the population, lower HIV prevalence rates, and lack of legislation protecting people living with HIV from screening for employment purposes, compared with countries without restrictions. Conclusion: Countries with a high proportion of international migrants tend to have travel restrictions &#x 2013; a finding that is relevant to migrant populations and travel medicine providers alike. Despite international pressure to remove travel restrictions, many countries continue to implement these restrictions for HIV-positive individuals on entry and stay. Since 2010, the United States and China have engaged in high profile removals. This may be indicative of an increasing trend, facilitated by various factors, including international advocacy and the setting of a UNAIDS goal to halve the number of countries with restrictions by 2015...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBesides the {{conventional}} public opinion pollsters, mass media {{have also been}} long to be another significant player in Indonesian polling activities. The numerous players of mass media in conducting polling since 1987, and the high intensity of media polling publications, have raised the question whether the media polling reflects the so-called the people's voices and preferences.
