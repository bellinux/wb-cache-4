5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} cephalopods, bony fishes, and other {{cartilaginous}} fishes, the copper shark is a fast-swimming predator {{that has been}} known to hunt in large groups, utilizing their numbers to their advantage; however for {{most of the time they}} remain solitary. Off South Africa, this species associates closely with the annual sardine run, involving millions of <b>southern</b> <b>African</b> <b>pilchard</b> (Sardinops sagax). Like other requiem sharks, it is viviparous, with the developing embryos mainly nourished through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Females bear litters of 7 to 24 pups every other year in coastal nursery areas, after a gestation period of 12 or perhaps as long as 21 months. It is extremely slow-growing, with males and females not reaching maturity until 13–19 and 19–20 years of age respectively.|$|E
25|$|Most years, off {{southern}} Africa between May and July, {{billions of}} sardines (specifically the <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> <b>pilchard</b> Sardinops sagax) spawn {{in the cool}} waters of the Agulhas Bank and move northward along {{the east coast of}} South Africa. This great fish migration is called the sardine run. Their sheer numbers create a feeding frenzy along the coastline. The run, containing millions of individual sardines, occurs when a current of cold water heads north from the Agulhas Bank up to Mozambique where it then leaves the coastline and goes further east into the Indian Ocean. During the sardine run, as many as 18,000 dolphins, behaving like sheepdogs, herd the sardines into bait balls, or corral them in shallow water. Once rounded up, the dolphins and other predators take turns ploughing through the bait balls, gorging on the fish as they sweep through. Seabirds also attack them from above, flocks of gannets, cormorants, terns and gulls. The sardine run is featured in the first episode of the 2001 BBC nature documentary The Blue Planet and in the 2008 3D IMAX documentary film Wild Ocean.|$|E
500|$|The {{copper shark}} feeds more towards {{the bottom of}} the water column than the top, {{consuming}} cephalopods, including squid (Loligo spp.), cuttlefishes, and octopus; bony fishes, including gurnards, flatfishes, hakes, catfishes, jacks, Australian salmon, mullets, sea breams, smelts, tunas, sardines, and anchovies; and cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish sharks (Squalus spp.), stingrays, skates, electric rays, and sawfishes. Cephalopods and cartilaginous fishes become relatively more important food for sharks over [...] long. Young sharks also consume scyphozoan jellyfish and crustaceans, including mud shrimps (Callianassa) and penaeid prawns. It does not attack marine mammals, though has been known rarely to scavenge on dolphins that had succumbed to fishing nets.

40|$|The central {{argument}} of this dissertation {{is that the}} regional integration among <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> states is in a continuous constitution and re-constitution process. In these processes of constitution and re-constitution, the European Union (EU) has three effects on the integration aspirations of <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> states: neutral, integrating and disintegrating. First, by critiquing the compartmentalized, epistemological pluralism of regional integration studies and looking at historical accounts and aspirations of <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> states, this dissertation argues for re-conceptualization of integration as emancipation. In the <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> context and this new conceptualization of "regional integration as emancipation," the EU has a neutral effect in regional integration aspirations of <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> states. Second, this dissertation argues for recognition of "norms of solidarity" as dominant picture of foreign policy making among <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> states. "Norms of solidarity" portray a combination of ideational and material factors that define the value and identity of African-ness in the foreign policy making of <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> states. At the moment, the degenerative state of feelings of African-ness or "norms of solidarity," and fear of loss of access to European markets, have overshadowed ideational concerns in contemporary <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> negotiations with the EU. Furthermore, the EU's push for liberalized trade arrangements in its relations with <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> states has shifted or minimized <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> states' ambitions for emancipatory 	 regional integration. In other words, contemporary EU - <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> states relations has resulted in making ideational concerns - that {{of the past in}} foreign policy making of <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> states. Third, in the constitution of regional integration, the EU had integrating effect. European colonial and racial domination was the central driving force for Africa's integration. By using historically sensitive methodologies, this dissertation deconstructs Eurocentric conceptions and engages in construction of Africanist conceptualizations of regional integration. In conclusion, this dissertation is an attempt at theorizing regional integration through historically sensitive methodologies and from <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> perspectives. 2021 - 02 - 0...|$|R

50|$|The South American {{pilchard}} (Sardinops sagax) is a sardine of {{the family}} Clupeidae, {{the only member of}} the genus Sardinops. It is found in the Indo-Pacific and East Pacific oceans.

It has other names, some of which more appropriately refer to subspecies, including blue pilchard, Australian pilchard (S. s. neopilchardus), blue-bait, Californian pilchard (S. s. caeruleus), Chilean sardine (S. s. sagax), Japanese pilchard (S. s. melanostictus), Pacific sardine, and <b>Southern</b> <b>African</b> <b>pilchard</b> (S. s. ocellatus).|$|E
