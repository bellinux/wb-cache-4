5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type of traumatic brain injury. It is typically defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which may not be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, feeling in a fog, and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Parkinson's disease, with {{treatment}} directed at improving symptoms. Initial treatment is typically with the antiparkinson medication levodopa (L-DOPA), with dopamine agonists being used once levodopa becomes less effective. As the disease progresses and neurons continue to be lost, these medications become less effective {{while at the same}} time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing movements. Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms. Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Evidence for treatments for the non-movement-related symptoms of PD, such as <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbances</b> and emotional problems, is less strong.|$|E
5|$|The most {{characteristic}} initial {{physical symptoms}} are jerky, random, and uncontrollable movements called chorea. Chorea may be initially exhibited as general restlessness, small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions, lack of coordination, or slowed saccadic eye movements. These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction {{by at least}} three years. The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity, writhing motions or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses. These are signs that the system in the brain {{that is responsible for}} movement has been affected. Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired, such that any action that requires muscle control is affected. Common consequences are physical instability, abnormal facial expression, and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and may lead to malnutrition. <b>Sleep</b> <b>disturbances</b> are also associated symptoms. Juvenile HD differs from these symptoms in that it generally progresses faster and chorea is exhibited briefly, if at all, with rigidity being the dominant symptom. Seizures are also a common symptom of this form of HD.|$|E

40|$|Aims and objectives: To explore {{prevalence}} and correlates of <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> among women aged 60 {{and over in}} Vietnam. Background: <b>Sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> can negatively influence human's health. <b>Sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> {{is likely to increase}} with age, and women appear to be more likely to experience <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> than men. Knowledge about <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> in women aged 60 and over in Vietnam is under-researched. Design: The study presents results from a cross-sectional survey of 440 women aged 60 and over from 16 rural and urban suburbs in Vietnam from 8 / 2014 to 1 / 2015. Methods: Structured questionnaires were used to gather data about residence, age, marital status, educational attainment, employment status, income, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, exercise, perceived stress, general health status, number of chronic diseases, and <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Descriptive analysis, bivariate correlation and binary logistic generalized linear model were used for data analysis. Results: Among older women in Vietnam, (1) the prevalence of <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> was 38. 9 %; (2) the most commonly problem was difficulty maintaining sleep, followed by sleep latency, reduced sleep quality, early waking, and daytime sleepiness; (3) BMI and physical health were significantly associated with <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> status.

40|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a common}} health {{condition}} that {{is often associated with}} disability, psychological distress and work loss. Worldwide, billions of dollars are expended each year trying to manage LBP, often with limited success. Recently, some researchers have reported that LBP patients also report <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> {{as a result of their}} LBP. However, as most of this evidence was obtained from highly selected groups of patients or from studies with small samples, high quality data on prevalence of <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> for patients with LBP are lacking. It is also unclear whether <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> is more likely to be reported by patients with recent-onset LBP than by patients with persistent LBP. Finally, it is not known whether high pain intensity, the most relevant condition-specific variable, is associated with higher rates of reported <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance.</b> The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of reported <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> in patients with LBP. In addition, we aimed to determine whether <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> was associated with the duration of back pain symptoms and whether pain intensity was associated with reported <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Data from 1, 941 patients obtained from 13 studies conducted by the authors or their colleagues between 2001 and 2009 were used to determine the prevalence of <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Logist ic regression analyses explored associations between <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> the duration of low back symptoms and pain intensity. The estimated prevalence of <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> was 58. 7 % (95 % CI 56. 4 - 60. 7 %). <b>Sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> was found to be dependent on pain intensity, where each increase by one point on a ten-point visual analogue scale (VAS) was associated with a 10 % increase in the likelihood of reporting <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Our findings indicate that <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> is common in patients with LBP.

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to examine {{associations}} between problematic Internet use, depression and <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> and explore whether there were differential effects of problematic Internet use and depression on <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance.</b> A total of 1772 adolescents who participated in the Shantou Adolescent Mental Health Survey were recruited in 2012 in Shantou, China. The Chinese version of the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) was used to evaluate the prevalence and severity of Internet addiction. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a 10 -item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD- 10), and other socio-demographic measures were also completed. Multiple regression analysis was used to test the mediating effect of problematic Internet use and depression on <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Among the participants, 17. 2 % of adolescents met the criteria for problematic Internet use, 40. 0 % were also classified as suffering from <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> and 54. 4 % of students had depressive symptoms. Problematic Internet use was significantly associated with depressive symptoms and <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance.</b> The correlation between depressive symptoms and <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> was highly significant.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to (a) explore the relationships among <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> fatigue, and depression and (b) test whether depression mediates the effect of <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> on fatigue in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A cross-sectional study was conducted with a total of 77 patients with HCC. All participants completed questionnaires that included the Brief Fatigue Inventory-Taiwan Form, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-Taiwan Form, and the depression subscale of the Taiwanese version of the Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale. Path analysis was used to test the mediation role of depression. Fatigue, <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> and depression are positively interrelated and co-occur in patients with HCC. Moreover, depression completely mediates the effects of <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> on fatigue. These findings suggest that depression is an important mechanism underlying the relationship between <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> and fatigue for patients with HCC. This is the first study to explore the phenomenon of symptom clustering in <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> fatigue, and depression in patients with HCC and to investigate the mediating role of depression that underlies the relationship between <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> and fatigue. The current findings are of clinical importance because they suggest the need to consider simultaneous management of <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> fatigue, and depression.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> and neuropsychological functioning in healthy, typically developing children and children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Three research questions were examined in this thesis. The first examined whether <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> is associated with specific deficits in executive functions or an overall deficit in executive functioning. The second research question {{examined the relationship between}} <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> and behaviour problems. A final research question examined whether <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> in the absence of hypoxia, affects executive functioning in a comparable way to <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> associated with hypoxia. The first study demonstrated that global executive function (GEF) was significantly lower in healthy children with higher <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance.</b> <b>Sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> was not associated with individual performance on executive function tasks. The second study also examined sleep and executive function in healthy children using a revised battery of neuropsychological tests. Compared to children with low <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> children with high <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> had significantly lower GEF and lower processing speed. Both sleep quantity and sleep quality predicted GEF however sleep quantity explained an additional unique proportion of the variance. The third study examined sleep in children with cystic fibrosis. When dichotomized into high and low sleep disturbed groups, neither GEF nor processing speed was significantly different between the two groups. The sleep and neuropsychological functioning of children with CF was compared to the healthy, typically developing children from Study 3. There {{were no significant differences between}} children with CF and healthy controls on any sleep measures or executive function performance. Nine children with CF underwent one night of polysomnography. A further aim of Study 3 was to examine whether neuropsychological deficits were greater if in the presence of both high <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> and nocturnal hypoxia. Executive function deficits were worse in children with nocturnal hypoxia, irrespective of whether they had high or low <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance.</b> In contrast, processing speed deficits were more evident in children with high <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> irrespective of whether they had nocturnal hypoxia. A consistent finding throughout this thesis was that children with higher conduct problems have increased <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> (measured using parent report and actigraphy). These findings have implications for children’s development; future research examining the effects of <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> on executive function should consider whether these effects are irreversible.

Methods We used three cross-sectional, multicenter data-sets from 2002, 2005, and 2008. Data-set 1 included diagnostic codes from 93 % of all patients receiving treatment in mental health care in Norway (N = 40261). Data-sets 2 (N = 1065) and 3 (N = 1181) included diagnostic codes, patient- and clinician-reported <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> and use of prescribed hypnotic medication from patients in 8 mental health care centers covering 10 % of the Norwegian population. Results 34 patients in data-set 1 and none in data-sets 2 and 3 had a diagnosis of insomnia as a primary or comorbid diagnosis. In data-sets 2 and 3, 42 % and 40 % of the patients reported <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> whereas 24 % and 13 % had clinician-reported <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> and 7 % and 9 % used hypnotics.

40|$|Chronic {{tinnitus}} is {{a debilitating}} condition and {{often accompanied by}} anxiety, depression, and <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance.</b> It {{has been suggested that}} <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> such as insomnia, may be a risk factor/predictor for tinnitus-related distress and the two conditions may share common neurobiological mechanisms. This study investigated whether acute stress-induced <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> could increase the susceptibility to acoustic trauma-induced tinnitus in rats. The animals were exposed to unilateral acoustic trauma 24 [*]h before <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> being induced using the cage exchange method.

40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} model fit, differential item function (DIF), {{and construct}} validity of select short forms from the PROMIS® <b>Sleep</b> <b>Disturbance</b> item bank. METHODS: We recruited cancer survivors who were between 6 - 13 months post diagnosis (n = 4, 956), {{as part of the}} Measuring Your Health (MY-Health) study. We measured <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> using 10 items commonly found in PROMIS <b>Sleep</b> <b>Disturbance</b> short forms (<b>Sleep</b> 4 a, Sleep 6 a, Sleep 8 b), and which are frequently administered in computerized adaptive testing. We evaluated domain reliability using Cronbach’s coefficient alpha and factorial validity by fitting a PROMIS <b>Sleep</b> <b>Disturbance</b> unidimensional measurement model using confirmatory factor analy-sis (CFA). At the item-level, we examined DIF with respect to race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White [NHW], non-Hispanic Black [NHB], Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander), age, and sex. We used a multi-group CFA and multiple indicators, multiple methods (MIMIC) analyses. We then assessed construct validity (convergent, discriminate, and known groups) for sleep short forms, and a new “best fit” 6 -item <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> short form. RESULTS: We identified a satisfactory unidimensional <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> 6 -item measure (χ 2 (6) 37. 6, p < 0. 001, RMSEA = 0. 031). To achieve this, we removed four items from the model with item content overlap and added residual covariances between positively worded items in order to address a method effect. We identified one instance of DIF: NHW participants were less likely to agree with the statement “I had difficulty falling asleep” compared to NHBs, Hispanics, or Asians/Pacific Islanders, who all reported the same level of <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance.</b> After controlling for DIF, we extended this into a MIMIC model, identifying no additional DIF by age or sex. Across all race/ethnicity groups, the adjusted overall means suggest that older adults reported significantly lower <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance,</b> and NHW, NHB, and Hispanic women reported significantly higher <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> than male survivors of the same race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: We could not fit a unidimensional measurement model for either the full 10 -items, or for any combination of <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> items used in PROMIS <b>Sleep</b> <b>Disturbance</b> short forms. However, after we removed the overlapping item content and adjusted for methods effects, a 6 -item measurement model for <b>sleep</b> <b>disturbance</b> fit the data well, with very little evidence of substantial DIF. This suggests this new measure (Sleep 6 b) can be used in different groups across the adult lifespan, and in males and females in a heterogeneous cancer population. Our findings suggest further validation work is necessary to understand the impact of reverse-scored items, response set effects, and content overlap in this item bank. ...|$|R
