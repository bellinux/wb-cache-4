500|$|In November 1925 Lombardo {{was named}} {{head of the}} Unione Siciliana, a Sicilian-American benevolent society that had been {{corrupted}} by gangsters. An infuriated Aiello, who had wanted the position himself, believed Capone was responsible for Lombardo's ascension and he resented the non-Sicilian's attempts to manipulate affairs within the Unione. Aiello severed all personal and business ties with Lombardo and entered into a feud with him and Capone, essentially ending a Chicago gang peace treaty {{that had been in}} force since the 1926 murder of Capone rival Hymie Weiss. Aiello allied himself with several other Capone enemies, including Dean O'Banion, and the trio of Billy Skidmore, Barney Bertsche and Jack Zuta, who ran vice and gambling houses together, although they became less receptive to Aiello after Capone personally approached and threatened Skidmore. While newspapers falsely reported that Aiello had also entered into an active alliance with George [...] "Bugs" [...] Moran and his North Side Gang at this time, Moran in fact pledged no <b>specific</b> <b>support</b> to Aiello until later, and instead privately supported Aiello from the sidelines without actively participating.|$|E
