5|$|There is {{evidence}} of spinning and weaving in late prehistoric houses throughout Britain, particularly in the later first millennium B.C.. Finds include <b>scraps</b> of fabric, loom-weights, spindle-whorls and bone needles, and the arrangement of post-holes may indicate they supported looms.|$|E
5|$|Chestnut sparrows are gregarious, and {{are only}} {{occasionally}} found away from flocks. They frequently associate with queleas and other weavers. Adults feed on grass seeds, and those near human habitations will also eat crumbs and other household <b>scraps.</b> Nestlings are fed mostly softer grass seeds, and small beetles are also recorded in their diet.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 it was {{estimated}} that there were 10,000 foxes in London. City-dwelling foxes may have the potential to consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts, as a result of abundant <b>scraps</b> and a relative dearth of predators. In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, although much of their diet will be similar to rural foxes.|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} a ‘Cycle of Matter’ model a {{comprehensive}} <b>scrap</b> cycle can be estimated for a region, country or continent. The model covers <b>scrap</b> flows between the three main actors defining the cycle, i. e. <b>scrap</b> users, <b>scrap</b> generators and <b>scrap</b> dealers. The ‘Cycle of Matter’ incorporates the generation and use of three types of <b>scrap,</b> i. e. home <b>scrap,</b> prompt <b>scrap</b> and obsolete <b>scrap.</b> It allows for a better assessment {{of the impact of}} government policies regarding <b>scrap</b> recycling {{in various parts of the}} <b>scrap</b> cycle. This paper presents the main results of a detailed study of the national <b>scrap</b> recycling industry of a developing country, Tanzania. The <b>scrap</b> flows in the ‘Cycle of Matter’ model were estimated on the basis of specially tailored surveys amongst <b>scrap</b> users, producers and traders, and on the basis of secondary data and coefficients derived from the literature. The paper demonstrates that the model is a powerful tool for the analysis of the <b>scrap</b> cycle. The study reveals that Tanzania possesses large surpluses of <b>scrap.</b> These surpluses are increasing over time. The <b>scrap</b> users — foundries and steel mills — are not capable of utilising all available <b>scrap.</b> Large quantities of <b>scrap</b> are thus either dumped in the environment or transferred abroad. Foundries and steel mills will only be able to make better use of existing <b>scrap</b> surpluses if they succeed in upgrading their quality of their production processes...|$|R
40|$|Besides iron ore, {{the main}} raw {{material}} {{of iron and}} steel production is steel <b>scrap.</b> This paper presents the quality and sources of creation the iron and steel <b>scrap</b> and estimation of their creation in the future. The content of impurities and trace elements to the <b>scrap</b> is very important and influencing {{to the quality of the}} obtained steel. Alloyed steel <b>scrap</b> known composition can often be used as an addition to a metal charge for steel production of the desired composition. Considering the steel <b>scrap</b> formation, the three major groups are elaborated: own <b>scrap</b> or circulation <b>scrap,</b> processing <b>scrap</b> and amortization <b>scrap.</b> The balancing model for estimating of steel <b>scrap</b> creation is based on the calculating the coefficients of the generation circulation, processing and amortization <b>scrap,</b> which are used as the basis for successful modelling...|$|R

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the War of the First Coalition, Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. Unfortunately for him, military rations were insufficient to satisfy his appetite. He would carry out tasks for other soldiers in return for a share of their rations and scavenge on the dungheap for <b>scraps,</b> but this was not enough to satisfy him. Suffering from extreme exhaustion, he was admitted to the military hospital at Soultz-Haut-Rhin. He was granted quadruple rations but remained hungry; he would scavenge for garbage in gutters and refuse containers, eat the <b>scraps</b> of food left by other patients, and creep into the apothecary's room to eat the poultices. Military surgeons could not understand his appetite; Tarrare was ordered to remain in the military hospital to take part in physiological experiments designed by Dr.Courville (surgeon to the 9th Hussar Regiment) and George Didier, Baron Percy, surgeon-in-chief of the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Several {{wild boars}} (Sus scrofa) are {{native to the}} park. They are often found near the beaches where they feed on <b>scraps</b> and trash dropped by visitors. Further within the forests of the peninsula, other mammals can be spotted, such as golden jackals (Canis aureus), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), and even several striped hyenas (Hyaena hyaena) and caracals (Caracal caracal), among many others usually not native to such areas.|$|E
5|$|The cannon {{appeared}} in 12th century China, probably as a parallel development or {{evolution of the}} fire-lance, a short ranged anti-personnel weapon combining a gunpowder-filled tube and a polearm of some kind. Co-viative projectiles such as iron <b>scraps</b> or porcelain shards were placed in fire lance barrels at some point, and eventually, the paper and bamboo materials of fire lance barrels were replaced replaced by metal.|$|E

40|$|Economy-wide <b>scrap</b> rates {{could be}} {{estimated}} if economy-wide original values {{of fixed assets}} and investment data were available, but they are not. Therefore, <b>scrap</b> rates are estimated based on subsets of the whole economy where the necessary data to do so are available. <b>Scrap</b> rates can be calculated from two independent combinations of the accounting identities presented in the paper. Depreciation-based <b>scrap</b> rates One way to calculate <b>scrap</b> rates is {{to make use of}} depreciation rates. With cumulative depreciation from equation (1) and depreciation from equation (5), <b>scrap</b> values (the original value of decommissioned fixed assets) follow in equation (4); <b>scrap</b> rates are obtained by inserting the <b>scrap</b> value in equation (3). Solving the four equations for the “depreciation-based ” <b>scrap</b> rate (and the unknown revaluation term) yields <b>scrap</b> ratet – (α * revaluationt / OFAt- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} effect of vessel {{specific}} and market variables on the probability of <b>scrapping</b> dry bulk ships. Using a dataset from 2012 to 2015, {{we find that the}} probability of <b>scrapping</b> increases with age, but that the relation between vessel size and <b>scrapping</b> probability varies across the different segments. In addition, while the relation between earnings and probability of <b>scrapping</b> ships is negative, bunker prices seem to affect only the <b>scrapping</b> rate of smaller tonnage. <b>Scrapping</b> probability also increases with an increase in interest rates, freight market volatility and <b>scrap</b> steel prices...|$|R
5|$|The wreck is {{steadily}} decaying, turning to oxide {{at a rate}} of 0.5–1 ton per day (assuming one ten-thousandth of an inch per day on all surfaces). Eventually Titanics structure will collapse, and she will be reduced to a patch of rust on the seabed, with any remaining <b>scraps</b> of the ship's hull mingled with her more durable fittings, like the propellers, bronze capstans, compasses and the telemotor.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the <b>scraps</b> more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E
5|$|Early Mormons {{understood}} the Book of Mormon to be a religious {{history of the}} indigenous peoples of the Americas. Smith's followers {{view it as a}} companion to the Bible and an additional witness of Christ, akin to a large apocryphal work. Modern historian Fawn Brodie has called the Book of Mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of Smith's times, saying that Smith composed the Book of Mormon drawing from <b>scraps</b> of information available to him. Dan Vogel, another historian, says that the work is autobiographical in nature.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scrap</b> {{reporting}} - This can be {{the most}} difficult area to maintain with any integrity. Start with isolating the <b>scrap</b> by providing <b>scrap</b> bins at the production site and then record the <b>scrap</b> from the bins on a daily basis. One benefit of reviewing the <b>scrap</b> on site is that preventive action can be taken by the engineering group.|$|R

50|$|By the mid-1950s, Woodham Brothers was trading {{mainly as}} a <b>scrap</b> metal merchants, {{producing}} high quality <b>scrap</b> metal {{for the newly}} nationalised steel industry. Dai Woodham, {{as a result of}} the British Rail decision, negotiated a contract in 1957 to <b>scrap</b> metal mainly from the Western Region, covering like other <b>scrap</b> merchants the easily handled railway line and rolling stock; the more complex steam locomotives were to be handled solely by the railway works. As none of the many South Wales-based <b>scrap</b> merchants knew how long the work from <b>scrapping</b> the short-wheelbase coal wagons from the former South Wales coalfield would last, they all chose to <b>scrap</b> these first.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} chapter of Palmetto Leaves, Stowe tells how she takes a steamer to Savannah, Georgia. On board is a stray dog who begs <b>scraps</b> of food and affection from the passengers. It finally becomes {{attached}} to a woman on board and follows her around. At Savannah, the dog is thrown into the street by the porters and waiters at the hotel, and is eventually left behind. Stowe compares the dog and the people who care for such stray animals to Christian ideals {{to take care of the}} poor and suffering.|$|E
5|$|Maya {{textiles}} {{are very}} poorly {{represented in the}} archaeological record, although by comparison with other pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Aztecs and the Andean region, {{it is likely that}} they were high-value items. A few <b>scraps</b> of textile have been recovered by archaeologists, but the best evidence for textile art is where they are represented in other media, such as painted murals or ceramics. Such secondary representations show the elite of the Maya court adorned with sumptuous cloths, generally these would have been cotton, but jaguar pelts and deer hides are also shown.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may kill small mustelids like weasels, stone martens, pine martens, stoats, kolonoks, polecats {{and young}} sables. Eurasian badgers may live {{alongside}} red foxes in isolated sections of large burrows. It {{is possible that}} the two species tolerate each other out of mutualism; foxes provide badgers with food <b>scraps,</b> while badgers maintain the shared burrow's cleanliness. However, cases are known of badgers driving vixens from their dens and destroying their litters without eating them. Wolverines may kill red foxes, often while the latter are sleeping or near carrion. Foxes in turn may kill unattended young wolverines.|$|E

5|$|Sea otters {{spend much}} of their time grooming, which {{consists}} of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, but they are not known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food <b>scraps</b> from their fur.|$|E
