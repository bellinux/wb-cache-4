5|$|Since early 2010, {{opinion polls}} {{regularly}} showed a majority {{support for the}} Progress Party and Conservative Party together. The Progress Party however saw a strong <b>setback</b> for the 2011 local elections. The party lost 6% in vote share, while the Conservative Party gained 9%. According to political scientists, most of the <b>setback</b> {{could be explained by}} a low turnout of Progress Party supporters.|$|E

40|$|SummaryHow {{do people}} cope with <b>setbacks</b> and persist with their goals? We examine how perceiving control over <b>setbacks</b> alters neural {{processing}} {{in ways that}} increase persistence through adversity. For example, a student might retake a class if initial failure was due to controllable factors (e. g., studying) but give up if failure was uncontrollable (e. g., unfair exam questions). Participants persisted more when they perceived control over <b>setbacks,</b> and when they experienced increased negative affect to <b>setbacks.</b> Consistent with previous observations involving negative outcomes, ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal (VMPFC) activity was decreased in response to <b>setbacks.</b> Critically, these structures represented distinct neural mechanisms for persistence through adversity. Ventral striatum signal change to controllable <b>setbacks</b> correlated with greater persistence, whereas VMPFC signal change to uncontrollable <b>setbacks</b> mediated the relationship between increased negative affect and persistence. Taken together, the findings highlight how people process <b>setbacks</b> and adapt their behavior for future goal pursuit...|$|R

50|$|For centuries, <b>setbacks</b> were a {{structural}} necessity for virtually all multi-level load-bearing masonry buildings and structures. As architects {{learned how to}} turn <b>setbacks</b> into an architectural feature, most <b>setbacks</b> were however less pronounced than in step pyramids and often skillfully masked by rich ornamentation.|$|R
5|$|Above {{the third}} <b>setback,</b> {{consisting}} of the 24th through 27th floors, the facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray-and-black brick motifs. Above the fourth <b>setback,</b> between the 27th and 31st floors, the shaft starts to appear. At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments made of Nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make the base look larger. These corner extensions alleviate a common optical illusion seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger. The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and fenders, which both symbolizes the Chrysler Corporation {{and serves as a}} visual effect for the building's Art Deco design. The bonnet embellishments take the shape of Mercury's winged helmet, which was modeled after the hood ornament installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-14th century Bristol is {{considered}} to have been England's third-largest town (after London and York), with an estimated 15–20,000 inhabitants {{on the eve of}} the Black Death of 1348–49. The plague inflicted a prolonged demographic <b>setback,</b> with the population estimated at between 10,000 and 12,000 during the 15th and 16th centuries.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Setbacks</b> {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised the album's production, features and lyrics. iHipHop {{gave it a}} 3.5 out of 5 rating mentioning [...] "While <b>Setbacks</b> is a misleading title, ScHoolboy Q does leave room for critique. Despite his overwhelmingly impressive flow, Q rarely says anything worthy of raising an eyebrow." [...] Allmusic gave it 4 out of 5 stars commenting [...] "Dividing his time between socially conscious rap and bud smoker’s anthems, ScHoolboy Q makes quite the impression on his debut “street album”". They called <b>Setbacks</b> polished, funky, well-balanced, and rewarding.|$|R
5|$|Later in 1985 {{the forces}} of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) {{received}} a <b>setback</b> at the village of Gut-Makur near Mongalla when they were confronted by well-armed Mandari people.

30|$|The {{process of}} {{innovation}} projects depends {{to a great}} extent on the skills of project leaders and the quality of their leadership (Burke et al. 2006; Müller and Turner 2010), yet it is often unclear what leadership styles work best in certain circumstances (Clarke 2012). Innovation projects often suffer from <b>setbacks.</b> What project leaders do during such <b>setbacks</b> is assumed to affect the progress of a project and the innovation that is being developed. Dealing with <b>setbacks</b> is a way of problem-solving, which usually implies making a deviation from rule-based and routinized tasks. Deviations have to be made when <b>setbacks</b> are experienced and reflected upon, a process which leads to learning in terms of modifying beliefs, mental models and knowledge, which eventually results in active problem-solving behaviour (Schley and Van Woerkom 2014).|$|R
