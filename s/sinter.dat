5|$|As a result, most geysers form {{in places}} where there is {{volcanic}} rhyolite rock which dissolves in hot water and forms mineral deposits called siliceous <b>sinter,</b> or geyserite, along {{the inside of the}} plumbing systems which are very slender. Over time, these deposits strengthen the channel walls by cementing the rock together tightly, thus enabling the geyser to persist, as mentioned in the previous section.|$|E
5|$|Hot springs {{are closely}} {{associated}} with fumaroles, which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and hot gases, such as sulfur dioxide. In general, the water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface. The formation of the springs depends both on the rocks the water has passed through and the profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater. Iron oxide, iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow, red, brown or green. Hot springs comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form siliceous <b>sinter,</b> whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy-looking calcareous rock called tufa. Overflow of the springs can build masses, spires or stepped terraces of calcareous <b>sinter</b> or tufa.|$|E

5|$|Like {{several other}} volcanoes in {{northern}} British Columbia, Level Mountain was volcanically active during past glacial periods. Its involvement with glaciation resulted in several interactions between magma and ice, affording multiple examples of glaciovolcanic processes.

5|$|The spring {{still exists}} {{and is now}} the site of a small modern pumping station. Its water is pure but high in {{dissolved}} calcium carbonate leached out of the surrounding limestone. This presented the Romans with significant problems in maintaining the aqueduct, as the carbonates precipitated out of the water during its journey through the conduit. This caused the flow of the aqueduct to become progressively reduced by deposits of calcareous <b>sinter.</b> Another threat was posed by vegetation penetrating the stone lid of the channel. As well as obstructing the flow of the water, dangling roots introduced algae and bacteria that decomposed in a process called biolithogenesis, producing concretions within the conduit.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain ceramic alumina {{materials}} by using the conventional free <b>sintering</b> process, 2. 45 GHz microwave <b>sintering</b> (MW) and spark plasma <b>sintering</b> (SPS). Technical and ultra-pure alumina was used to obtain specimens. The effect of temperature and time of <b>sintering</b> on the density, porosity, Young’s modulus and Vickers hardness of Al 2 O 3 ceramics was determined. Mechanical and physical properties of the obtained materials were compared between the methods of <b>sintering.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Al 2 O 3 ceramics materials were <b>sintered</b> by the conventional free-sintering process and the non-conventional methods comprise microwave <b>sintering</b> and spark plasma <b>sintering.</b> Density, porosity, elastic modulus and Vickers hardness were determined for the obtained materials from technical and ultra-pure alumina. Findings: The use of advanced <b>sintering</b> processes allowed the authors to receive alumina ceramic materials with good mechanical and physical properties at the time of one minute for microwave <b>sintering</b> to ten minutes for spark plasma <b>sintering.</b> According to the theory <b>sintering</b> temperature increases with increasing of alumina purity, which was confirmed in the carried out works on the basis of Young’s modulus values and density values. Practical implications: Alumina ceramics made by the microwave <b>sintering</b> process and spark plasma <b>sintering</b> can be applied as the ceramics for cutting tools and also elements of the pharmaceutical equipment because microwave <b>sintering</b> ensures purity of the <b>sintered</b> materials. Originality/value: The non-conventional methods for <b>sintering</b> ceramics primarily comprises (SPS) and (MW). SPS simultaneously applies pulsed electrical current and pressure directly on the sample leading to densification at relatively lower temperatures and short retention times. In the recent years, MW occurred as an advanced <b>sintering</b> technique in the world. Among many works on <b>sintering</b> alumina and alumina-composites until now there have been no reports of microwave <b>sintering</b> of alumina in Poland. Microwave <b>sintering</b> offers increased density and requires lower <b>sintering</b> temperature and time.

25|$|White Portland cement {{or white}} {{ordinary}} Portland cement (WOPC) {{is similar to}} ordinary, grey, Portland cement in all respects, except for its high degree of whiteness. Obtaining this colour requires high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the method of manufacture, a.o. a higher kiln temperature required to <b>sinter</b> the clinker {{in the absence of}} ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal clinker. As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the clinker (normally 1450°C), the white cement requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600°C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which should be less than 0.5wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for white cement, and less than 0.9wt.% for off-white cement. It also helps to have the iron oxide as ferrous oxide (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero excess oxygen at the kiln exit. This gives the clinker and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), TiO2 (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.|$|E
