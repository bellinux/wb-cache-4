40|$|A novel {{architecture}} forasecond-order continuous-time switched-current modulator is presented. The loop {{delay is}} reduced bypredicting {{the states of}} the second integrator and feeding the predicted states to the comparator. The predicted states are generated by summing three <b>scaled</b> <b>current</b> mode signals. A Gain-Manager is used toaccurately control the integrator gain to generate the predicted states and stabilize the system. A newly designed high-speed current-mode comparator is capable of summing the three <b>scaled</b> <b>current</b> inputs and comparing them. With a 50 MHz sampling rate, it has achieved 60 dB dynamic range (10 bit) at 1 MHz. The modulator has been fabricated ina 2 um CMOS process with an active area of 0. 37 mm 2.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new start-up calibration method and algorithm for current-steering D/A converters. The method extends the ideas presented in [1] {{and the proposed}} current cell allows its application on generic DAC architectures, i. e. binary, thermometer, segmented. With respect to the thermometer type implementations, the binary implementations are area efficient and the calibration may even further reduce their size. Unlike the thermometer converters, which use identical currents, the binary converters are problematic for calibration {{at the level of}} current sources due to the different weights of their current sources. A new transistor level architecture for <b>scaled</b> <b>current</b> cells is proposed. It uses a set of parallel calibrated unit elements to construct a signal current source. When after the calibration, these are assembled back, the accuracy of the current sources is improved. Moreover, the method is independent from the architecture of the converter. Therefore, for all current-steering DAC architectures, an optimal area solution through optimising the calibration strength exists. Further, the paper analyses the start-up calibration requirements for generic DAC architectures. It offers a tool to estimate the calibration strength for an optimal area solution. An example of a 12 -bit self-calibrated DAC, a high-level model and simulations verify the presented and analysed method. A general discussion on the advantages and constraints of the new calibration method is offered and conclusions are drawn...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reports on}} the investigation of two related topics, the (in) -organic electronic ratchet and the organic solar ratchet. These are two implementations of the electronic ratchet device that will first be introduced. The electronic ratchet generates electrical current and voltage by rectifying an external perturbation, {{in the present case}} an oscillating voltage. The oscillation is rectified by a periodic, asymmetric potential in which electronic charges are placed. The external perturbation drives the system away from equilibrium, causing detailed balance to be broken; consequently the periodic asymmetry of the potential leads to a net motion of the charges, comparable to the net motion of marbles on a shaking washboard. Note that under equilibrium conditions no (spontaneous) current will flow in any potential. In this presentation we show that the generated current {{as a function of the}} frequency of the driving signal can be scaled onto a universal profile, covering many orders of magnitude in frequency. Simulations show that this profile is predominantly dependent on drift (as opposed to diffusion) currents in the ratchet. Experimentally this is verified by combining measurements on three different disordered semiconducting materials. IGZO (Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide) as an inorganic amorphous electron semiconductor and Pentacene and P 3 HT/PCBM as organic hole semiconductors. The combined <b>scaled</b> <b>current</b> profile shows a consistent behavior for the three materials over at least seven orders of magnitude of (scaled) frequency. The solar ratchet is a lateral solar cell which can in lowest order be seen as multiple solar cells in series, which is comparable to a multi-junction tandem solar cell. The goal is to create a large open circuit voltage with the intention to create a more efficient solar cell. Simulation of this device turned out to be troublesome due to numerical problems related to the calculation of diffusion currents and of bimolecular recombination. However the first version of the simulation tool, in which drift and diffusion currents are calculated sequentially, shows the possible behavior of the solar ratchet. The second version, in which the drift and diffusion currents are simultaneously calculated using the Boltzmann transport equation, predicts the solar ratchet to be non-functional due to zero recombination. However, the depletion length of the recombination zones can be calculated. On basis of this an analogy can be made with the recombination zone in the pn-junction in a conventional tandem solar cell. As the tandem solar cell is known to work the solar ratchet is predicted to work as well. Experimental proofs of principle of the ratchet solar cell were tried to be made but unfortunately no suitable solar ratchet was produced due to various problems that will be discussed.

40|$|According to ITRS 2. 0 2015, memory {{technologies}} {{will continue to}} drive pitch scaling and highest transistor count. As DRAM products are expected to reach their scaling limits by 2024, and unless some major breakthrough occurs, flash memory is expected to lead the semiconductor industry towards the next revolution in transistor density. Inspired from this fact, this work focuses on molecular flash memories and logic switching molecular networks which, among all emerging technology candidates, are considered particularly promising due to their ability for reduction of size per cell and solution processing (low cost, injection-printing friendly), conceptual compatibility with photonic addressing due to molecular photosensitivity, multilevel storage, high information density, quick write-read operations, low power consumption, mechanical flexibility, bottom-up fabrication logic (overcoming the lithographic patterning constrains), conceptual non-binary data representation and properties’ tunability through chemical tailoring. Molecular electronic devices are fabricated via a combination of bottom-up layer-by-layer nanofabrication and self-assembly with CMOS platform lithography {{in order to provide}} a low cost large-scale route towards extension of the functional value of Si-based platforms. Tungsten Polyoxometalates (POM, [PW 12 O 40] 3 - of the Keggin class are being self-arranged both on nanocrystal and hyperstructure level in a rational way resulting in layers of tunable spatial correlation length. The hyperstructures exhibit tunable valence and conduction bands and, hence, adjustable electronic properties directly related to the extent of crystallization of their building blocks. Dimensional crossover-driven insulator-to-semimetal transitions can be enforced in these hyperstructures via tuning the extent of crystallization in solution. Being able to transport or confine charge at will, these hyperstructures constitute ideal candidates for alternative molecule-based solution-printed circuitry components and transistor channels. Hybrid CMOS/molecular memory devices based on the parallel plate architecture are fabricated, characterized and tested. Each memory element contains a planar hyperstructure of molecules (typically several millions) that can store charge having multiple times the charge density of a typical DRAM capacitor. Transition-metal-oxide hybrids composed of high surface-to-volume ratio Ta 2 O 5 matrices and tungsten POMs are investigated as a charge storage composite in molecular nonvolatile capacitive memory cells. Enhanced internal scattering of carriers results in a memory window of 4. 0 V for the write state and a retention time around 10 4 s without blocking medium. Differential distance of molecular trapping centres from the cells gate and electronic coupling to the space charge region of the underlying Si substrate are being identified as critical parameters for enhanced electron trapping {{for the first time in}} such devices. The incorporation of a molecular-friendly blocking oxide that facilitates long term retention while suppressing cross-talking, is performed through realization of a multi-functional oxide stack (SiO 2 /hybrid Ta 2 O 5 -POM transition metal oxide/Al 2 O 3) that takes parallel advantage of photonically-addressed phononic modes to boost information storage and reach molecular states that were previously non-available. A 37 % information density increase is attained via phononic pumping, while the memory window reaches 7. 0 V, corresponding to ∼ 4 × 10 ^ 14 cm^- 2 charging nodes able to carry 65 - 195 μCb/cm^ 2. Ability of multi-state addressing and write speed of 10 ns are being documented for the packed cell. The fabricated high performance non-volatile memories are the first documented CMOS-compatible long term (10 years criterion satisfaction) retention molecular capacitive cell of its kind. Following a different approach, brain-inspired, neural systems performing in networks and data-centric non-Von Neumann processing are among the latest trends for non-conventional approaches in the semiconductor industry. We focus on hybrid molecular-nanoparticle networks that exploit the massive parallelism of designless interconnected networks of locally active components, obviating the need for expensive lithographic steps. Molecular multi-junction networks comprising of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of diam. ∼ 1. 4 nm, electronically linked by means of copper 3 -diethylamino- 1 -propylsulphonamide sulfonic acid substituted phthalocyanine (CuPcSu) molecules are fabricated and studied. When electrons flow through the non-linked nanoparticle arrays, they experience on-site Coulomb repulsion and are strongly localized, with localization length (ξ= 0. 7 nm). Under dynamic excitation the system undergoes Coulomb oscillations, while the introduction of CuPcSu molecules results in the formation of a network of multiple molecular/Au nanojunctions and conductance increases by 5 orders of magnitude. This switching behaviour functions on reversible red-ox reactions and pushes carriers in a weak localization state. In this state electrons spread over several junctions and all temperature <b>scaled</b> <b>current</b> vs voltage curves, J/T^(1 +α) vs eV/kT, collapse in one universal curve, characterizing the network and the extent of its disorder. On the other hand, the strongly non-linear I-V response and negative differential resistance of drop-cast nanojunction 3 -d arrays makes them suitable platforms for logic function exhibition. Common miniaturization bottlenecks such as capacitive crosstalk, are embraced as exploitable physical processes, that can lead to robust computational functionality. The networks can be configured on-flight with pulses as quick as 10 ns to modify their resistance between two discrete levels. Both levels can be addressed real time utilizing patterned nano-electrode pairs and reading voltage of the order of 500 mV. The networks are able to perform as a two-input “then-if” logic gates...|$|E

40|$|Progress toward {{understanding}} {{principles of}} nonlinear growth and saturation of large scale magnetic fields {{has emerged from}} comparison of theoretical models that incorporate the evolution of magnetic helicity with numerical simulations for problems that are more idealized than expected in astrophysical circumstances, but still fully non-linear. We carry out a new comparison of this sort for the magnetic field growth from forced isotropic helical turbulence in a periodic box. Previous comparisons be- tween analytic theory and simulations of this problem have shown that a two-scale model compares well with the simulations in agreeing that the driver of large scale field growth {{is the difference between}} kinetic and current helicities associated with the small scale field, and that the backreaction that slows the growth of the large scale field as the small <b>scale</b> <b>current</b> helicity grows. However, the two-scale model artificially re- stricts the small <b>scale</b> <b>current</b> helicity to reside at the same scale as the driving kinetic helicity. In addition, previous comparisons have focused on the late time saturation regime, and less on the early-time growth regime. Here we address these issues by comparing a three scale model to new simulations for both early and late time growth regimes. We find that the minimalist extension to three scales provides a better model for the field evolution than the two-scale model because the simulations show that the small <b>scale</b> <b>current</b> helicity does not reside at the same scale as that of the driving kinetic helicity. The simulations also show that the peak of the small <b>scale</b> <b>current</b> helicity migrates toward lower wave numbers as the growth evolves from the fast to saturated growth regimes.
