These cars benefited mostly from small cosmetic changes on the exterior {{as well as a}} quite extensively redesigned interior. Car spotters can distinguish the two series by the headlights, which were chrome-rimmed and flush fitting on the later, recessed on the earlier series, the deeper rear window, now fitted with a rear wash wipe, and the new plastic wrap around bumpers which replaced the three-piece rubber and stainless steel ones. Other details, which are not as easy to assign include the full-width rear badge strip under the tail lights, engine size badges on front wings, and a range of new wheel trims and alloy wheels. [...] The automatic gearbox was now a GM180 model, still offering three speeds but better ratios. [...] The electric window <b>switch</b> <b>pack</b> moved from the centre console to the driver's door (and is well remembered for lacking edge finishing trim around the recesses), and a fully automatic choke appeared – eliminating the manual choke lever which had a tendency to break.|$|E

40|$|The newest Pentium chip {{powering}} PCs and laptops contains 40 million electronic <b>switches</b> <b>packed</b> onto a {{piece of}} silicon {{about the size of}} a thumbnail. Several years from now, if this incredible shrinking continues, a single chip will hold a billion switches, then a trillion. The logical culmination is a computer in which the switches are so tiny that each consists of an individual atom. At that point something miraculous happens: Quantum mechanics kick in. Anyone who follows the science news or watches 'Star Trek' has at least a notion of what that means: particles that can be in two or more places at once, that can seem one moment like hard little specks of matter and the next like waves. Atoms obey a peculiar logic of their own - and if it can be harnessed society will be transformed. Problems that would now take for ever even on a supercomputer would be solved almost instantly. Quantum computing promises nothing less than a shortcut through time. In this brief and totally absorbing book, we are brought to the front of one of the most engaging and far-reaching scientific dramas of this new century.

This method includes an in situ silane (SiH~) cleaning treatment which greatly increases titanium silicide nuclei, and a silicon consumption control. Native oxide reduction from the silicon surface by the Sill 4 cleaning treatment is confirmed by secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements. The deperidence of the source-gas flow rate on silicon consumption and film resistivity are clarified.

By applying thin titanium silicide films to test devices with 0. 1 -~m-deep shallow junctions, a low contact resistivity of 7 2 ~ 1 2 around 10 - ~-cm and a low leakage current of around 10 - A/mm are obtained. The dependence of growth time on contact resistance and leakage current is also clarified. The scaling down of semiconductor devices has resulted in increased <b>switching</b> speed, <b>packing</b> density, and reliabil-ity.

40|$|The OTN (Optical Transport Network) standard, {{defined by}} ITU-T Recommendation G. 709 and G. 872, {{contains}} a flexible digital hierarchy of ODU (Optical Data Unit) signals. The ODU hierarchy provides sub-wavelength grooming in OTN networks, which {{is necessary for}} efficient utilization of the high bit rates of optical channels. When dimensioning the links of a transport network consisting of ODU <b>switches,</b> the <b>packing</b> of lower order ODU signals into higher order ODU signals {{needs to be taken}} into account. These networks are expected to be controlled by GMPLS (Generalized MPLS), which puts specific constraints on the dimensioning. We assume that there is no explicit label control and that the GMPLS control plane is using first-fit strategy for making reservations on a link. With these assumptions the link dimensioning problem is defined as deciding how many higher order ODU component links are required on an OTN GMPLS bundled link for first-fit packing of a given set of lower order ODU demands, in any order of arrival. The paper provides strict bounds for ODU hierarchy-specific item and bin sizes. Then, it introduces an extended variant of the dimensioning problem, when lower order ODU connections which are not controlled by GMPLS are also present...|$|R

Substitutions that resulted in residue 341 having a smaller side-chain than residue 344 switched the stoichiometry of the domain from tetrameric to dimeric. The three-dimensional structure of one such dimer was determined by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy.

However, direct communication between the nodes produces a range of security vulnerabilities, which the home agent avoided. This paper attempts to provide the advantages of using the home agent as an intermediary whilst reducing the latency of triangle routing. This can be achieved with the proposed use of a mobile home agent which essentially follows the mobile node as it moves between points of attachment providing location privacy and pseudo-direct communication, which can be incorporated into the distributed authentication protocol or be used as a stand alone solution...|$|R

After digesting what he had heard, the commander began apprising his leadership of the situation and stressing that he believed Mossabah. He then looked at the roster of ESU officers working his shift, from midnight to 8 a. m. The urgency of the situation prohibited him from calling in people from home and handpicking a team to enter the apartment Mossabah shared with the two suspects; he would have to go with those already available. The commander called a sergeant and four police officers and told them to meet him at the precinct. After the five arrived, Mossabah was again asked to tell his stoty from the beginning. They interrupted him with even more questions and requests for clarification and had him draw an extensive diagram of his apartment building 2 ̆ 7 s exterior and his apartment 2 ̆ 7 s interior, highlighting the locations of the backpacks as well as the spaces Mezer and Khalil normally ocrupied. The commander took his team into another room and devised his tactical plan, giving out assignments as they progressed. The team would exerute a standard dynamic search warrant entry. Mossabah would lead them to the building. and they would enter using his key. The building the team saw upon exiting their vehicle looked nothing like the one Mossabah had sketched at the precinct. Thoughts of an ambush ran through the officers 2 ̆ 7 minds. Mossabah then led the team through a narrow alley, at the end of which the team saw a building resembling the one he had drawn.

As the number of processor cores and IP blocks integrated on a single chip is steadily growing, a systematic approach to design the communication infrastructure becomes necessary. Different variants of <b>packed</b> <b>switched</b> on-chip networks have been proposed by several groups during the past two years. This book summarizes the state of the art of these efforts and discusses the major issues from the physical integration to architecture to operating systems and application interfaces.

The consequences may in fact be far reaching because many of the topics of distributed systems, distributed real-time systems, fault tolerant systems, parallel computer architecture, parallel programming as well as traditional system-on-chip issues will appear relevant but within the constraints of a single chip VLSI implementation.

The second presents problems and solutions concerning the hardware and the basic communication infrastructure. Finally, the third part covers operating system, embedded software and application.

We focus {{on the use of}} optical solitons and all‐optical logic gates to implement ultrafast ‘‘interchanges’’ or switching nodes on packet networks with speeds of 100 Gbit/s or greater. For example, all‐optical logic gates have been demonstrated with speeds up to 200 Gbit/s, and they may be used to decide whether to add or drop a data packet. The overall goal of our effort is to demonstrate the key enabling technologies and their combination for header processing in 100 Gbit/s, time‐division‐multiplexed, <b>packed</b> <b>switched</b> networks. Soliton‐based fiber logic gates are studied with the goal of combining attractive features of soliton‐dragging logic gates, nonlinear loop mirrors, and erbium‐doped fiber amplifiers to design logic gates with optimum switching energy, contrast ratio, and timing sensitivity. First, the experimental and numerical work studies low‐latency soliton logic gates based on frequency shifts associated with cross‐phase modulation. In preliminary experiments, switching in 15 m long low‐birefringent fibers has been demonstrated with a contrast ratio of 2. 73 : 1. Using dispersion‐shifted fiber in the gate should lower the switching energy and improve the contrast ratio. Next, the low‐birefringent fiber can be cross‐spliced and wrapped into a nonlinear optical loop mirror to take advantage of mechanisms from both soliton dragging and loop mirrors. The resulting device can have low switching energy and a timing window that results from a combination of soliton dragging and the loop mirror mechanisms...|$|R
