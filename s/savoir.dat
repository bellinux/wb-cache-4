5|$|Other {{recurring}} characters appear {{only briefly}} in La Cousine Bette; previous appearances, however, give deep {{significance to the}} characters' presence. This {{is the case with}} Vautrin, the criminal mastermind who tutors young Eugene de Rastignac in Balzac's 1835 novel Le Père Goriot. When he resurfaces in La Cousine Bette, he has joined the police and introduces the Hulot family to his aunt, Mme. Nourrison, who offers a morally questionable remedy for their woes. Although Vautrin's presence in La Cousine Bette is brief, his earlier adventures in Le Père Goriot provide instant recognition and emotional texture. Elsewhere, Balzac presents an entire world of experience by including characters from a particular sphere of society. For example, several scenes feature artists like Jean-Jacques Bixiou, who first appeared in 1837's Les Employés and in many other books thereafter. The world of Parisian nightlife is quickly brought to mind with the inclusion of several characters from Les Comédiens sans le <b>savoir</b> (1846), and Bianchon appears– as always– when a doctor is needed.|$|E
25|$|When {{the hotel}} was expanded, Rupert D'Oyly Carte decided to develop a luxurious, {{handcrafted}} bed unique to the Savoy and his other hotels. His Savoy Bed, also called the No. 2 Bed, was covered in a ticking whose design is attributed to his stepmother, Helen Carte. In 1924, the hotel bought James Edwards Limited, the manufacturer of the bed. Later, the Savoy Group sold the company, which became <b>Savoir</b> Beds in 1997. <b>Savoir</b> Beds continues to make the Savoy Bed for the hotel.|$|E

Rivette said that Va Savoir+ is a completely different film than Va <b>Savoir,</b> the major difference being lengthy scenes of the actors performing Pirandello's Come tu mi vuoi instead of just rehearsals.

500|$|The tale is {{followed}} immediately by two morals: [...] "one {{stresses the importance}} of possessing industrie and <b>savoir</b> faire while the other extols the virtues of dress, countenance, and youth to win the heart of a princess."

500|$|At {{the start}} of the book, the shopkeeper {{discusses}} with Valentin [...] "the great secret of human life". They consist of three words, which Balzac renders in capital letters: VOULOIR ("to will"), POUVOIR ("to be able"), and <b>SAVOIR</b> ("to know"). Will, he explains, consumes us; power (or, in one translation, [...] "to have your will") destroys us; and knowledge soothes us.

500|$|After Rivette had later {{success with}} La Belle Noiseuse and Va <b>Savoir</b> in the 1990s, he {{revisited}} his older unproduced screenplays. With Hélène Frappat, he published in book form {{three of his}} [...] "phantom films" [...] including Marie et Julien in 2002. He decided to film Marie et Julien; a script had never been written and the footage had been lost, but cryptic notes by his assistant Claire Denis that had been kept by Lubtchansky (who had also been cinematographer in 1975) were enough to work from. The original screenplay included a speaking [...] "polyglot cat", characters whose names change, a [...] "suicide room" [...] similar to The Seventh Victim, [...] "Madame X", and an unknown [...] "forbidden gesture" [...] that the notes stated: [...] "Do not forget".|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Sarsgaard starred {{alongside}} Jon Foster and Sienna Miller in {{the drama}} The Mysteries of Pittsburgh. It is an adaptation of Michael Chabon's novel of the same name. In the movie, Sarsgaard plays Cleveland, the rebellious bisexual boyfriend of Miller's character. The Mysteries of Pittsburgh premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. His next film appearance was in the thriller Orphan, where he and Vera Farmiga play a married couple who lose a baby and adopt a nine-year-old girl, who is not as innocent as she claims to be. Furthermore, in the same year, Sarsgaard starred as David in Lone Scherfig's coming of age film An Education. The role required Sarsgaard to speak in a British accent. An Education drew favorable reviews from critics. According to Variety, [...] "Sarsgaard... marvelously expresses the <b>savoir</b> faire that has such an impact on Jenny [...]" [...] Sarsgaard played a federal agent in the action comedy film Knight and Day, released in June 2010, in which he appeared alongside Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. In February 2010, {{it was announced that}} Sarsgaard had been cast as villain Hector Hammond in the superhero film Green Lantern. The film was released in 2011.|$|E
