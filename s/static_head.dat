The cells are shallow to reduce <b>static</b> <b>head</b> - {{based on the principle}} of shallow container geometry. The packaging material should conduct heat well; and it should be durable enough to withstand frequent changes in the storage material's volume as phase changes occur. It should also restrict the passage of water through the walls, so the materials will not dry out (or water-out, if the material is hygroscopic). Packaging must also resist leakage and corrosion. Common packaging materials showing chemical compatibility with room temperature PCMs include stainless steel, polypropylene and polyolefin.|$|E

This is in effect 20 metres of green water (possibly a super rogue wave) flowing over the vessel. The deck cargo hatches on the Derbyshire were determined {{to be the key}} point of failure when the rogue wave washed over the ship. The design of the hatches only allowed for a static pressure of less than two metres of water or 17.1 kN/m2, in other words the typhoon load on the hatches was more than ten (10) times the design load. The forensic structural analysis of the wreck of the Derbyshire is now widely regarded as irrefutable.|$|E

40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} and kinetic properties {{associated with}} intrinsic uncoupling in a six-state {{model of a}} redox proton pump have been studied by computing the flow-force relations for different degrees of coupling. Analysis of these relations shows the regulatory influence of the thermodynamic forces on the extent and relative contributions of redox slip and proton slip. Inhibition has been introduced into the model in two different ways, corresponding to possible modes of action of experimental inhibitors. Experiments relating the rate of electron transfer to delta microH at <b>static</b> <b>head</b> upon progressive inhibition of the pumps have been simulated considering (1) the limiting case that the nonzero rate of electron transfer at <b>static</b> <b>head</b> is only due to intrinsic uncoupling (no leaks) and (2) the experimentally observed case that about 30 % of the nonzero rate of electron transfer at <b>static</b> <b>head</b> {{is due to a}} constant proton leakage conductance in parallel with the pumps, the rest being due to intrinsic uncoupling. The same simulations have been performed for experiments in which the rate of electron transfer is varied by varying the substrate concentration rather than by using an inhibitor. The corresponding experimental results obtained by measuring delta microH and the rate of electron transfer at different succinate concentrations in rat liver mitochondria are presented. Comparison between simulated behavior and experimental results leads to the general conclusion that the typical relationship between rate of electron transfer and delta microH found in mitochondria at <b>static</b> <b>head</b> could certainly be a manifestation of some degree of intrinsic uncoupling in the redox proton pumps.

40|$|Centrifugal {{devices such}} as pumps, fans, and {{compressors}} follow a general set of speed affinity laws: Q 2 = Q 1 *(N 2 /N 1) [Equation 1]; H 2 =H 1 *(N 2 /N 1) 2 [Equation 2]; P 2 =P 1 *(N 2 /N 1) 3 [Equation 3] where Q= flow rate, N = speed, H =head, and P = shaft power. The subscripts 1 and 2 represent two different speed conditions. In fluid systems {{where there is no}} <b>static</b> <b>head,</b> the system head, like the pump head, is proportional to the velocity, or flow rate, squared. As a result, the pump affinity laws also indicate how the pump and system will work together to define the operating point in such a system; in other words, the system flow rate is linear with pump speed. Stable control of system flow rate is easily achieved. In these all-frictional systems, the energy efficiency merits of using an adjustable speed drive (ASD) is apparent if one simply considers the effect of a 20 % reduction in speed: the flow rate drops by 20 %, but the pump input power drops almost in half. But not all fluid systems are all-frictional. In fact, some fluid systems are dominated by static, rather than frictional head. When there is <b>static</b> <b>head</b> in a fluid system, the system no longer follows the same rule that head is proportional to flow rate squared. Instead, there is a constant term (<b>static</b> <b>head),</b> to which is added a variable term (dynamic, or frictional) head. The operational response to a speed change in a system with <b>static</b> <b>head</b> is both system and device dependent, which means that both the system and the centrifugal device characteristic curves must be known to predict the result of a speed change. This interdependence between the pump and system is often overlooked in pump selection. Much work has been done historically in defining control characteristics of valves (the alternative, less energy efficient means of flow control). There is a need to develop a better awareness of the sometimes nonlinear behavior of pumps under ASD flow control. This paper explores the behavior of ASD-controlled pumps in systems with varying levels of <b>static</b> <b>head.</b> Some potential parametric and single value figures of merit for evaluating the suitability of pump, drive, and system combinations are discussed, and an important pump selection technique in adjustable speed applications is described...|$|E
40|$|Rotation of {{the eyes}} about the visual axis is known as ocular torsion. A lateral {{inclination}} (a "roll") of the head induces ocular torsion in the opposite direction, a response known as ocular counterrolling. For six subjects, we recorded the <b>static</b> (<b>head</b> still) and dynamic (head in oscillatory roll motion) ocular torsion in normal 1 g condition and also during the microgravity and hypergravity periods of parabolic flight, using the electromagnetic scleral search coil technique. With the head still, the direction and magnitude of torsion that occurred in response to microgravity and hypergravity differed substantially from one individual to another, {{but there was a}} significant difference in torsional magnitude between the microgravity and hypergravity periods, for all <b>static</b> <b>head</b> positions including the upright position. Under normal 1 g conditions, counterrolling compensated for about 16 % of (voluntary) <b>static</b> <b>head</b> roll, while dynamic counterroll was much larger, up to 36 % of head roll at 0. 55 Hz. With increasing frequency of head oscillation between 0. 33 Hz and 0. 55 Hz, the gain of counterrolling increased and there was no change in the phase relationship. The gain of dynamic counterroll (in response to voluntary head rolling) was not significantly less in hypogravity, suggesting that on the ground at these frequencies the contribution of gravity and gravity receptors to this reflex is redundant: this reflex is probably driven by the semicircular canals. In some subjects, the torsional displacement in microgravity is accompanied by micro-torsional oscillatory motion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: For {{decades the}} {{dismounted}} soldier has navigated to his mission objective using maps, a compass, and his pace count as navigation tools. Recently, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers were added {{as an additional}} aid to dismounted navigation. However, GPS is limited as a navigation aid by its inability to provide <b>static</b> <b>heading</b> and its lack of availability when used around obstructions (terrain or man-made), or {{in the presence of}} jannning. Therefore, maps, a compass, and a pace count are still needed to ensure successful navigation. Under the Force XXI Land Warrior (FXXI LW) program, a Government-Industry team is prototyping an integrated navigation system for the dismounted soldier. The integrated navigation system consists of GPS and a Dead Reckoning Module (DRM). The DRM makes use of state-of-the-art, small, low power electronic components in a single miniaturized package to replace the compass and the need for the soldier to count paces. The DRM design allows hands-free navigation. The DRM data and GPS information are used by a Kaiman filter to form an integrated navigation solution by balancing the weaknesses of one sensor using the strengths of the other sensor. The integrated navigation design provides automatic selection of one navigation m QUALrre raapsensD 4 data source when the data from the other position sensor is corrupted or not available. The design also provides for manual selection/deselection of a navigation source. Upon successful completion of testing, the integrated navigation technology will be transitioned to the Land Warrior (LW) system.
