5|$|Darwin {{observed}} that the males of some <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> as birds of paradise, were {{very different from the}} females.|$|E
5|$|In some <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> as Heliconius charithonia, mating {{can occur}} inside the pupa of females by males.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry {{may involve}} {{numerous}} species; many harmless <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as hoverflies are Batesian mimics of strongly defended <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as wasps, while many such well-defended species form Mullerian mimicry rings, all resembling each other. Mimicry between prey species and their predators often involves {{three or more}} species.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{mathematical}} representations that model <b>species</b> competition, <b>such</b> as using non-polynomial functions.|$|R
50|$|The subalpine scrub with {{an average}} annual {{rainfall}} 2000-6000 mm is above the tree line to 1800-2000 m, at elevations where frosts occur regularly in winter, dominated by shrubs in the plant families of Ericaceae (Erica spp.), Asteraceae (Hubertia spp., Psiadia spp., Stoebe passerinoides), and Rhamnaceae (Phylica nitida), with some notable endemic <b>species</b> <b>suchs</b> Heterochaenia rivalsii (Campanulaceae), Eriotrix commersonii (Asteraceae), and Cynoglossum borbonicum (Boraginaceae).|$|R
50|$|Some <b>species</b> infect gamefish, <b>such</b> as sciaenids, {{during the}} {{parasitic}} worm's plerocercoid stage, and are commonly called spaghetti worm {{because of their}} appearance, approximating cooked spaghetti. <b>Such</b> <b>species</b> include Poecilancistrium caryophyllum and Pseudogrillotia pleistacantha.|$|R
5|$|Omnivorous mammals such as {{the raccoon}} and skunk and {{herbivore}} mammal <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as the porcupine and pika, are common to the forest. The beaver is considered a species of special interest to Shoshone National Forest since its dam building activities improve habitat for numerous other <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as the moose, breeding waterfowl, various amphibians and other species dependent on a riparian environment.|$|E
5|$|Species are {{generally}} diploid with 2n=22 chromosomes, but some <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> as Hippeastrum iguazuanum, have 24.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin sometimes forms mixed species groups with other species from the dolphin family, particularly larger <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> as the short-finned pilot whale, the {{false killer whale}} and Risso's dolphin. They also interact with smaller <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> as the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the rough-toothed dolphin. While interactions with smaller species are sometimes affiliative, {{they can also be}} hostile.|$|E
50|$|Corals. Corals formed reefs in {{the lower}} Glen Rose {{and a number of}} <b>species</b> of <b>such</b> corals have been described.|$|R
50|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{refers to}} physical differences {{between males and}} females of the same <b>species.</b> One <b>such</b> difference can be in size.|$|R
5000|$|Similar {{patterns}} of relatedness and distribution across the Pacific and Atlantic sides {{have been found}} in other <b>species</b> pairs <b>such</b> as: ...|$|R
5|$|While the {{perianth}} may point forwards, in some <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as N. cyclamineus it {{is folded}} back (reflexed, see illustration, left), while {{in some other}} <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as N. bulbocodium (Table I), it is reduced to a few barely visible pointed segments with a prominent corona.|$|E
5|$|A related {{problem for}} aerobic organisms is {{oxidative}} stress. Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation {{and the formation}} of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as hydrogen peroxide. These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant metabolites such as glutathione and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases.|$|E
5|$|All juniper species grow berries, {{but some}} are {{considered}} too bitter to eat. In addition to J. communis, other edible species include Juniperus drupacea, Juniperus phoenicea, Juniperus deppeana, and Juniperus californica. But the berries of some <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> as Juniperus sabina, are toxic and consumption of them is inadvisable.|$|E
5000|$|Indirect {{biological}} effects {{which involve}} changes in <b>species</b> interactions <b>such</b> as predation, brood parasitism, competition, herbivory, and biotic pollination and seed dispersal ...|$|R
5000|$|Since then, Neolloydia {{has been}} a dumping ground for <b>species</b> from <b>such</b> diverse genera as Mammillaria, Coryphantha, Escobaria, Echinomastus, Cumarinia, and Thelocactus.|$|R
50|$|Syzygium smithii {{is listed}} as a fire {{retardant}} <b>species</b> by <b>such</b> authorities as Gosford Council NSW, NSW Fire Service and the Country Fire Authority.|$|R
5|$|Allogamy (outcrossing) on {{the whole}} is {{enforced}} through a late-acting (ovarian) self-incompatibility system, but some <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as N. dubius and N. longispathus are self-compatible producing mixtures of selfed and outcrossed seeds.|$|E
5|$|Also defined herewith: orbital ring. A visible ring of {{feathers}} around a bird's eye; the eye-ring is often paler than the surrounding feathers. By contrast, an orbital ring is bare skin ringing the eye. In some <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> as little ringed plover, the orbital ring {{may be quite}} conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|Although a large {{majority}} of bumblebees follow such monogynous colony cycles that only involve one queen, some select Bombus <b>species</b> (<b>such</b> as Bombus atratus) will spend part of their life cycle in a polygynous phase (have multiple queens in one nest during these periods of polygyny).|$|E
5000|$|Highly migratory <b>species</b> (HMS) <b>such</b> as {{tuna and}} billfish, or Patagonian {{toothfish}} (Dissostichus eleginoides) in the Antarctic. {{which can be}} caught in multiple regions ...|$|R
50|$|Some <b>species</b> are ovoviviparous, <b>such</b> as pseudomorphine carabids.|$|R
5000|$|This {{marine species}} has only ever {{occurred}} within European waters (European Register of Marine <b>Species</b> scope) <b>such</b> as the Bay of Biscay, Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea.|$|R
5|$|Although many Lilium <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as Lilium martagon and Lilium candidum can be {{obtained}} commercially, the majority of commercially available lilies represent the products of a very diverse hybridisation program, which {{has resulted in a}} separate horticultural classification, including such groupings as Asian, Oriental and Orienpet. In addition to a very wide variety of heights, lilies can {{be obtained}} in many colours and combinations of colours, and if properly selected can produce an extensive blooming season from early summer to autumn. Because of the history of Liliaceae, many <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as Watsonia (bugle lily) that were previously classified in this family bear the name 'lily' but are neither part of the genus Lilium, or the Liliaceae family.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{considered}} poisonous, P.fusiformis {{is not recommended}} for consumption. Some related <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as Phallus impudicus or Mutinus caninus {{are considered to be}} edible (or even delicacies) in the immature egg stage; however, the foul smell of stinkhorns at maturity would likely deter most individuals from eating them.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of the forest areas around Pichilemu are covered with pine and eucalyptus plantations, a native forest (now the Municipal Forest) remains. It contains <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as Litres, Quillayes, Boldos, Espinos, and Peumos.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{characters}} are highly individual, even unique {{members of a}} <b>species.</b> Many <b>such</b> people from the outer worlds find refuge in Oz, which is highly tolerant of eccentricity.|$|R
2500|$|True IMTA can be land-based, using ponds or tanks, or even open-water marine or {{freshwater}} systems. Implementations {{have included}} <b>species</b> combinations <b>such</b> as shellfish/shrimp, fish/seaweed/shellfish, fish/seaweed, fish/shrimp and seaweed/shrimp.|$|R

5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{introduce}} H.gammarus to New Zealand, alongside other European <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as the edible crab, Cancer pagurus. Between 1904 and 1914, one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in Dunedin, but the species did not become established there.|$|E
5|$|Between Sydney and Brisbane, B.integrifolia {{is found}} up to 200 {{kilometres}} (125mi) inland, with B.integrifolia subsp. monticola {{occurring in the}} Blue Mountains at altitudes up to 1500 metres (5000ft). There it grows on better quality volcanic or rocky soils derived from granites and basalts, and would experience up to 100 frosts per year. In this montane habitat, it occurs in association with Eucalyptus <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as E.viminalis (manna gum) and E.pauciflora (snow gum), and also rainforest <b>species</b> <b>such</b> as Nothofagus moorei (Antarctic beech) and Orites excelsa (prickly ash).|$|E
5|$|Co{{evolution}} is {{the evolution}} {{of two or more}} species which reciprocally affect each other, sometimes creating a mutualistic relationship between the <b>species.</b> <b>Such</b> relationships can be of many different types.|$|E
50|$|It {{is closely}} related to C. cunninghamiana. Hybrids with C. cunninghamiana subsp. cunninghamiana have been {{recorded}} where the two <b>species</b> co-occur, <b>such</b> as at Lower Portland and Wisemans Ferry.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>species</b> epithets, <b>such</b> as Enicurus scouleri and Hypericum scouleri commemorate his name. Scouler made large {{collections}} of specimens {{in the western}} regions of North America and the Galapagos.|$|R
5000|$|Philydraceae is {{a family}} of {{flowering}} plants composed of three genera {{and a total of}} six known <b>species.</b> [...] <b>Such</b> a family has not been recognized by many taxonomists.|$|R
