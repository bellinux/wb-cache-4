50|$|When in its molten state, the basalt {{was very}} liquid, {{so that it}} spread out over a large area, like pancake batter on a griddle. These flows cooled from both the top and the bottom forming the {{hexagonal}} columns which are visible on several of the islands surrounding New Eddystone rock. After the basalt flows covered the floor of Behm Canal, another glacial advance <b>scoured</b> <b>away</b> much <b>of</b> the flow, leaving behind New Eddystone Rock {{and some of the}} islands to the northeast.|$|R
40|$|Because of overusing water {{resources}} in the upper and middle reaches of the Haihe Basin, less and less water flows to the river mouth. The Haihe River flow is cut off in most time of the seasons, sediment deposited in the river mouth channel is rarely <b>scoured</b> <b>away,</b> and many <b>of</b> the river mouth channels have been shrinking quickly. The discharge capacity of the channel is consequently reduced greatly, which results {{in more and more}} serious flood hazard. Many tide gates have been built for storing fresh water and preventing the salty and turbid water. The channel downstream of the gate is silting up and people have to dredge the channel every year before the flood season. This paper studies the laws of the siltation and strategies controlling channel shrinkage. The strategies are digger dredging, trailer dredging, scouring with pumping water or storing tidal water, building double guiding dikes and building a new gate. Comparison of various strategies is performed, suggesting the most effective strategy controlling estuarine channel shrinkage. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|In the {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> the explosive mixture is drawn through two gauzes (cylinder and shelf), burnt and then within the chimney are only burnt gases, not explosive mixture. Like a Clanny, and the Davy before it, {{it acts as}} an indicator <b>of</b> <b>firedamp,</b> burning more brightly in its presence. Later models had graduated shields by which the deputy could determine the concentration <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> from the heightening of the flame. Whilst the Clanny will continue to burn if laid on its side, potentially cracking the glass; the Mueseler will extinguish itself due to the stoppage of convection currents.

5000|$|Alongside firedamp, other damps include blackdamp (carbon {{dioxide and}} other gases), poisonous, {{explosive}} stinkdamp (hydrogen sulfide), with its characteristic [...] "rotten egg" [...] odour, and the insidiously lethal afterdamp (carbon monoxide and other gases) produced following explosions <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> or coal dust.|$|R
50|$|Glaciation has {{strongly}} <b>scoured</b> <b>away</b> {{the deeply}} weathered soils that presumably existed here in preglacial time. It left behind firm and rugged ledges {{in the low}} hills and swells of the ground and spread an irregular drift cover over the lower parts, whereby the drainage is generally disordered being deposited in lakes and swamps and elsewhere rushing down rocky rapids.|$|R
5000|$|Much of {{the river}} valley was <b>scoured</b> <b>away</b> by the Anglian Stage, but parts were covered and {{preserved}} by glacial soil deposits which has enabled geologists and archaeologists to reconstruct its course.

5|$|The South Wales Coalfield {{produced}} the sought-after anthracite, bituminous and steam coals—the latter a grade {{between the two}} comprising a hard coal without the coking elements. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities <b>of</b> <b>firedamp,</b> a highly explosive gas consisting of methane and hydrogen, and were therefore prone to explosions; firedamp rises into the higher points of workings, including cavities or, as at Senghenydd, when the seams were being mined in an upward gradient. An additional danger <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> is afterdamp, a poisonous mixture of gases left after an explosion, primarily constituted of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. They combine with haemoglobin in the bloodstream to stop cells carrying oxygen, which can result in suffocation by lack of oxygen or anoxia. If survivors from an explosion are not rescued quickly, they face {{the possibility of being}} killed by the gas. The presence <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> contributed to a higher-than-average proportion of accidents: between 1880 and 1900 South Wales accounted for 18% of Britain's miners, but 48 per cent of all UK mining deaths occurred in the region. As coal output from British collieries reached its peak in 1913 there was a correspondingly large number of accidents around this time.|$|R
2500|$|The Oaks explosion: A series <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> {{and coal}} dust explosions that {{resulted}} in the death of 361 men and boys. [...] This was the worst colliery disaster in the United Kingdom until the Senghenydd Colliery Disaster in 1913 and is to date the worst in England.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the coal}} mining industry, {{this type of}} coal is known for {{releasing}} the largest amounts <b>of</b> <b>firedamp,</b> a dangerous mixture of gases that can cause underground explosions. Extraction of bituminous coal demands the highest safety procedures involving attentive gas monitoring, good ventilation and vigilant site management.|$|R
5000|$|Afterdamp - The {{gas from}} an {{explosion}} <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> or coal dust. Contains varying proportions of blackdamp and whitedamp {{and is therefore}} suffocating, toxic, or explosive, or any combination of these. Afterdamp may also contain stinkdamp. Afterdamp may be a bigger killer following an explosion than the explosion itself.|$|R

50|$|One {{advantage}} of Stephenson's design over Davy's {{was that if}} the proportion <b>of</b> <b>firedamp</b> became too high, his lamp would be extinguished, whereas Davy's lamp could become dangerously hot. This was illustrated in the Oaks colliery at Barnsley on 20 August 1857 where both types of lamp were in use.|$|R
50|$|The worst mining {{disaster}} in Tyldesley occurred at Yew Tree Colliery on 11 December 1858.
