In light of this result, Zhou et al. [16] propose bundling swarms together, allowing peers to exchange pieces across different swarms, and claim that such “universal swarms ” can increase BitTorrent’s stability region. In this work, we formally characterize the stability region of universal swarms and show that they indeed exhibit excellent properties. In particular, bundling al-lows a <b>single</b> <b>seeder</b> with limited upload capacity to serve an arbitrary number of disjoint swarms if the arrival rate of peers in each swarm {{is lower than the}} seeder upload capacity. Our result also shows that the stability region is insensitive to peers ’ upload capacity, piece selection policies and number of swarms. ...|$|E
40|$|Seeders (peers {{that do not}} request {{anything}} but contribute to the system) are a powerful concept in peer-to-peer (P 2 P). They allow to leverage the capacities of a P 2 P system. While seeding is a natural idea for filesharing or video-on-demand applications, it seems somehow counter-intuitive {{in the context of}} live streaming. This paper aims at describing the feasibility and performance of P 2 P live seeding. After a formal definition of "live seeding" and efficiency, we consider the theoretical performance of systems where the overhead is neglected. We then propose a linear overhead model and extend the results for this model, for a <b>single</b> <b>seeder</b> and for a set of seeders as well (it is not always possible to perfectly aggregate individual efficiencies in a given system) ...|$|E

40|$|Campylobacter {{is a very}} {{important}} human foodborne pathogen that is present in commercial broiler flocks. This organism lives in the intestinal tract of broilers without causing avian disease. However, commercial poultry products are frequently implicated as vehicles of human campylobacteriosis. Flocks are typically free of Campylobacter for the first 2 to 4 wk of broiler production. A flock may be completely free of Campylobacter 1 wk but entirely colonized by the next week. This study showed the incidence and level of Campylobacter transmission to pen mates of various ages after exposure to a <b>single</b> colonized <b>seeder</b> bird. Approximately 1 wk after being housed in a pen with an inoculated seeder bird, all of the other birds became Campylobacter positive. This work emphasizes the importance of preventing all sources of Campylobacter from a flock, because a single colonized bird could infect an entire flock during the growout period...|$|R

This paper aims at describing the feasibility and performance of P 2 P live seeding. After a formal definition of "live seeding" and efficiency, we consider the theoretical performance of systems where the overhead is neglected. We then propose a realistic overhead model and extend the results for this model. The performance of a <b>single</b> <b>seeder</b> and a set of seeders are considered, as it is not always possible to perfectly aggregate individual efficiencies. In details, we provide an explicit upper bound of seeders' achievable efficiency in a P 2 P system with linear overhead. We also propose and study two simple mechanisms that allow to deploy a live seeding architecture while handling seeders aggregation, providing near-optimal seeding...|$|E
