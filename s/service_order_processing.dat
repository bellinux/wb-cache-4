An efficient service fulfillment platform automates <b>service</b> <b>order</b> <b>processing</b> to gain speed via flowthrough capabilities and to reduce the service order fallout that results from manual processes.

40|$|Workflow {{management}} is {{primarily concerned with}} dependencies between the tasks of a workflow, to ensure correct control flow and data flow. Transaction management, on the other hand, is concerned with preserving data dependencies by preventing execution of conflicting operations from multiple, concurrently executing tasks or transactions. In this paper we argue that many applications will be served better if the properties of transaction and workflow models are supported by an integrated architecture. We also present preliminary ideas towards such an architecture. 1 Introduction Many applications in a current data processing environment involve operations on multiple systems. Examples of multi-system application include travel reservation (often discussed in literature), <b>service</b> <b>order</b> <b>processing</b> [1], and loan processing in a bank. Current transaction-oriented information systems provide only limited support for managing the control and data workflow of multi-system applications. TP-m [...] ...|$|E

They {{have over the}} years embarked on outsourcing strategies such as back office activities (such as security <b>services,</b> cleaning <b>services,</b> <b>order</b> <b>processing,</b> others); primary activities (manufacturing, purchases, warehousing, sales force, customer service, others); accounting activities (such as financial reporting, tax processing, others) and support activities (legal services shipping/ transportation, IT services/system, training, others).

From the responses gotten through the questionnaire, this research found out that, SMEs outsource back office activities such as, security services, cleaning <b>services,</b> bookkeeping <b>services,</b> <b>order</b> <b>processing</b> and other administrative services. Giving out these services to outside vendors who can perform them better has also resulted in a decrease in the cost of running the enterprises. Giving out theses services which are practically augmenting in nature also paves way for the enterprises to focus on their core areas and so enjoy the benefits of specialization.|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} service discovery infrastructure with UDDI as the {{de facto}} standard, is limited in {{that it does not}} support more complex searching based on matching business processes. Two business processes match if they agree on their simple <b>services,</b> their <b>processing</b> <b>order</b> as well as any mandatory or optional requirements for the service. This matching semantics can be formalized by modelling business processes as annotated finite state automata (aFSAs) and deciding emptiness of the intersection aFSA. Computing the intersection of aFSAs and deciding emptiness are computationally expensive, being more than quadratic on the number of states and transitions, thus does not scale for large service repositories. This paper presents an approach for indexing and matching business processes modeled as aFSAs, for the purpose of service discovery. Evaluation of this approach shows a performance gain of several orders of magnitude over sequential matching and a linear complexity wi th regard to the data set size...|$|R

40|$|Automatic form {{validation}} enables telecommunication {{carriers to}} process incoming <b>service</b> <b>order</b> requests more effectively. Validation rules, however, can be nontrivial to test and ultimately {{depend on the}} carrier's internal software systems. Traditionally, these validation checks are spread throughout an application's source code, which makes maintaining and evolving the system a very complex task. Our approach to solving this problem involves decoupling the rules, giving them a simple, easy-to-understand representation, and creating an engine to apply these rules to incoming forms automatically. This paper presents our approach in detail, explains its parallelism and briefly presents the differences with other common rule-based engines. Keywords: Rule-Based systems, Form Validation.

40|$|Digit <b>order</b> <b>processing</b> {{is highly}} related to {{individual}} differences in arithmetic performance. To examine whether serial scanning or associative mechanisms underlie <b>order</b> <b>processing,</b> <b>order</b> tasks (i. e. deciding whether three digits were presented in an order or not) were administered in two experiments. In the first experiment, digits were presented in different directions namely ascending, descending and non-ordered. For each direction, close and far distance sequences were presented. Results revealed reversed distance effects for ordered sequences, but ascending sequences elicited faster performance and stronger reversed distance effects than descending sequences, suggesting that associative mechanisms underlie <b>order</b> <b>processing.</b> In the second experiment, it was examined to which extent the relation between <b>order</b> <b>processing</b> and arithmetic is number-specific by presenting order tasks with digits, letters and months. In all order tasks similar distance effects were observed and similar relations with arithmetic were found, suggesting that both general associative mechanisms and number-specific mechanisms contribute to arithmetic.
