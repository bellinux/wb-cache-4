5000|$|The {{strontium}} unit was formerly known briefly as the <b>sunshine</b> <b>unit,</b> a term {{promoted by the}} United States Department of Defense until public ridicule brought about its disuse. (Among the sources of this outcry was a George Carlin performance, released on the CD Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics, during a passage on governmental euphemisms for dangerous or unethical activities: [...] "The Pentagon has actually begun measuring nuclear radiation in something they call 'sunshine units'!") ...|$|E

It formerly comprised the San Jacinto Girl Scout Council's <b>Sunshine</b> Service <b>Unit.</b> Itl combined with a Southeast Houston service unit (Sunnyside's Edgewood Service Unit) in 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Bureaucracies {{frequently}} spawn euphemisms {{of a more}} deliberate nature, doublespeak expressions. For example, in {{the past}} the US military used the term <b>sunshine</b> <b>units</b> for contamination by radioactive isotopes. [...] An effective death sentence in the Soviet Union during the Great Purge often used the clause [...] "imprisonment without right to correspondence:" [...] the person sentenced {{never had a chance to}} correspond with anyone, because soon after imprisonment he would be shot. As early as 1939, Nazi official Reinhard Heydrich used the term Sonderbehandlung ("special treatment") to mean summary execution (most likely by hanging) of persons viewed as [...] "disciplinary problems" [...] by the Nazis even before commencing the systematic extermination of the Jews. Heinrich Himmler, aware that the word had come to be known to mean murder, replaced that euphemism with one in which Jews would be [...] "guided" [...] (to their deaths) through the slave-labor and extermination camps after having been [...] "evacuated" [...] to their doom. Such was part of the superficially innocuous formulation Endlösung der Judenfrage (the [...] "Final Solution to the Jewish Question"), which became infamous to the entire world during the Nuremberg Trials.|$|R
5000|$|Billie Ritchie (14 September 1878 - 6 July 1921) was a Scottish comedian {{who first}} gained transatlantic fame as a {{performer}} for British music hall producer Fred Karno—this, a full decade before Stan Laurel and Charlie Chaplin took a similar career path. Ritchie is best recalled today for the silent comedy shorts he made between 1914 and 1920 for director/producer Henry Lehrman's L-KO Kompany and Fox Film <b>Sunshine</b> Comedy <b>unit.</b> Variations on Ritchie's [...] "tramp" [...] and [...] "drunk" [...] personae - which Ritchie had developed before and during his Karno years- were introduced to film audiences by Charlie Chaplin in such shorts as the Lehrman-directed Kid Auto Races at Venice (7 February 1914) and Mabel's Strange Predicament (9 February 1914).Ritchie, who - due {{to a series of}} on-set injuries, spent his final years relatively inactive- succumbed to stomach cancer in the summer of 1921.Winifred Frances, the comedian's widow, and one-time stage partner, wound up in the employ of Charlie Chaplin. Wyn Ritchie, their daughter, was also a performer, and, in private life, the wife (of 55 years) of songwriter Ray Evans.|$|R
50|$|As {{the result}} of yet another dispute—this time with {{executives}} at Universal—Lehrman left L-KO {{towards the end of}} 1916 and took over the <b>Sunshine</b> Comedies <b>unit</b> at Fox. After Lehrman's departure, L-KO was taken over by Julius and Abe Stern -- brothers-in-law to Universal's founder Carl Laemmle -- and they named John G. Blystone director-in-chief. Blystone headed L-KO for a few months but he ultimately went to Fox Sunshine as well. L-KO nonetheless kept going for quite some time and proved a valuable training ground for new or developing comedy talent. Director Charles Parrott, better known as Charley Chase, came onto the L-KO lot in August 1918 and directed a few subjects through to near the end of L-KO's existence. Dapper comic Raymond Griffith made his film debut at L-KO in 1915 and comedian Eva Novak did so in 1917. Even Fatty Voss managed to direct one two-reeler, Fatty's Feature Fillum, just before his untimely death in 1917, his whole film career spent at L-KO. What finally brought around the end of L-KO was not Lehrman's departure, nor declining receipts for L-KO's product, but an outbreak of the Spanish influenza bug on the lot that forced Universal to shut the whole studio down. L-KO's last release, An Oriental Romeo (1919) starring Chinese funnyman Chai Hong, was released on September 24, 1919, but the studio had already been closed for good in May.|$|R
