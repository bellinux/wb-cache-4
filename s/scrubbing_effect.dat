50|$|Self-adjusting files is {{a general}} term for hollow, {{compressible}} files made of nickel-titanium that adapt three-dimensionally {{to the shape of}} a given root canal, including its cross section. The files are operated with vibratory in-and-out motion, with continuous irrigation of disinfectant delivered by a peristaltic pump through the hollow file. A uniform layer of dentin is removed from the whole circumference of the root canal, thus achieving the main goals of root canal treatment while preserving the remaining root dentin. The 3D <b>scrubbing</b> <b>effect</b> of the file, combined with the fresh irrigant, result in clean canals, which in turn facilitate better obturation. More effective disinfection of flat-oval root canals is another goal that is simultaneously attained.|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{cyclones}} {{have a lower}} {{collection efficiency}} for smaller particles and conventional wet scrubbers have significant clogging and fouling problems by salt formation at the tip, the {{inside and outside of}} the nozzles, the tubes and the walls of scrubbers. Also, many companies and manufacturing sites have been in trouble for collecting their adhesive particulates. The novel swirl scrubber that we have developed consists mainly of a cyclone and a swirl scrubber with an impact cone and plates. This study reports the collection efficiency of particulates and the application of the novel swirl scrubber. The particle collection efficiency as a function of particle size was investigated with changes of plate angles, nozzle size and pressure, and volumetric flow rate of scrubbing medium. The particle collection efficiency increased with a decrease in plate angle, an increase in pressure of scrubbing medium at the nozzle tip, and an increase in volumetric flow rate of the scrubbing medium. The collection efficiency of PM 10 by <b>scrubbing</b> <b>effect</b> was much higher than that by cyclonic effect. In particular, the total increase in particle collection efficiency by <b>scrubbing</b> <b>effect</b> was significant (around 2. 5 m) in particle aerodynamic diameter. The developed novel swirl scrubber can be used for significantly increasing the collection efficiency of TSP, PM 10, and PM 2. 5, in particular, which have adhesive characteristics. The costs for installation, operation and maintenance of the scrubber system are much cheaper than those of cyclones and scrubbers or other particulate collecting devices...|$|E
40|$|In the LHC, in {{addition}} to the molecular photodesorption due to synchrotron radiation, an electron cloud will produce a significant gas load due to electron stimulated desorption. This electron cloud build-up is strongly dependant on the primary photoelectrons, secondary electron production and on the reflectivity of photons and electrons. The dependence of these phenomena on surface properties and of vacuum chamber materials is discussed. Experiments performed at cryogenic temperatures with the COLDEX apparatus, installed on an external EPA synchrotron radiation beam line, are presented. Photon irradiations at room temperature have been performed to study in detail the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>effect</b> by photons and electrons and will be used to extrapolate to the condition in the SPS and the LHC vacuum systems.

The model {{takes into account}} the unique aspects of track cycling associated with riding around a velodrome. These include, riding upon a banked track and the resulting tyre <b>scrubbing</b> <b>effects,</b> and the tipping motion of a cyclist passing through a corner with the resulting centripetal forces. Validation was provided using SRMTM power crank data and split times obtained for an elite national cyclist in a 4 [*]km pursuit competition. Results have shown the model to over-predict cyclist performance with a discrepancy of 0. 7 s in a finals event and 4. 3 s, less than 2 % error, in a qualifying race. It is believed this may be attributable to discrepancies in atmospheric variables. However the model has proved capable of predicting the velocity increase, specifically associated with track cycling, as a cyclist passes through a bend. The model is useful for analysis of the physics of track cycling, and can be used to quantitatively predict performance dependent upon bicycle efficiencies, tyre type and venue conditions, in a racing scenario...|$|R

40|$|Hydrothermal {{systems and}} related vents can exhibit {{dramatic}} changes in their physico-chemical conditions over time {{as a response to}} varying activity in the feeding magmatic systems. Massive steam condensation and gas scrubbing processes of thermal fluids during their ascent and cooling cause further compositional changes that mask information regarding the conditions evolving at depth in the hydrothermal system. Here we propose a new stability diagram based on the CO 2 -CH 4 -CO-H 2 concentrations in vapor, which aims at calculating the temperatures and pressures in hydrothermal reservoirs. To filter gas <b>scrubbing</b> <b>effects,</b> we have also developed a model for selective dissolution of CO 2 -H 2 S-N 2 -CH 4 -He-Ne mixtures in fresh and/or air-saturated seawater. This methodology has been applied to the recent (November 2002) crisis that affected the geothermal field off the island of Panarea (Italy), where the fluid composition and fluxes have been monitored for the past two decades. The chemical and isotopic compositions of the gases suggest that the volatile elements originate from an active magma, which feeds a boiling saline solution having temperatures of up to 350 C and containing 12 mol CO 2 in vapor. The thermal fluids undergo cooling and re-equilibration processes on account of gas-water-rock interactions during their ascent along fracture networks. Furthermore, steam condensation and removal of acidic species, partial dissolution in cold air-saturated seawater and stripping of atmospheric components, affect the composition of the geothermal gases at shallow levels. The observed geochemical variations are consistent with a new input of magmatic fluids that perturbed the geothermal system and caused the unrest event. The present-state evolution shows that this dramatic input of fluids is probably over, and that the system is now tending towards steady-state conditions on a time scale of months...|$|R

30|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} of volcanic gas at Aso volcano using volatile traps from 2002 to 2011 revealed that higher HCl/SO 2 ratios {{are associated with}} increasing volcanic activities. The HCl/SO 2 ratios obtained during the observation period can be categorized into three levels: high (≤ 0.2), intermediate (0.1 ∼ 0.2), and low (≤ 0.1). From March 2003 to August 2005, and from December 2008 to August 2011, the HCl/SO 2 ratios were generally at intermediate levels, with sporadic high HCl/SO 2 ratios associated with small ash emissions. During other periods with no ash emission, the HCl/SO 2 ratios were constantly low (∼ 0.02 in average). The HCl/SO 2 ratio and the water level in the crater lake are correlated; the lower the water level in the crater lake, the higher the HCl/SO 2 ratio. The reduced <b>scrubbing</b> <b>effect</b> of HCl from the intensely-emitted volcanic gas by a smaller amount of water is likely to generate high HCl/SO 2 ratios of volcanic gas. In addition, evaporation of HCl from {{the water of the}} crater lake with extreme acidity may contribute to high HCl/SO 2 ratios.|$|E

Other factors investigated included the influence of attrition <b>scrubbing,</b> the <b>effect</b> of oxidants and reductants and the recycling of lixiviants. Experimental data obtained at the bench- and pilot-scale levels indicated 80 to 95 % of the uranium could be removed from the uranium-contaminated soils by using a carbonate lixiviant.

40|$|To {{reduce their}} sulfur emissions, many {{coal-fired}} electric power plants use wet flue-gas scrubbers. These scrubbers convert sulfur oxides into solid sulfate and sulfite sludge, which must then be disposed of. Knowledge of scrubber sludge characteristics {{is necessary for}} the development of purification technologies which will make it possible to directly utilize scrubber sludges rather than landfilling them. This project is studying the use of minimal-reagent froth flotation as the purification process, using the surface properties of the particles of unreacted limestone to remove them and their associated impurities from the material, leaving a purified calcium sulfite/gypsum product. In the current quarter, research was focused on two different areas. The first part of this quarter the optimization of the feed slurry percent solids for the two inch water-only cyclone was completed. The optimization of the vortex finder, spigot diameter and inlet feed pressure was completed in the previous quarter. The second part of this quarter began the investigation of why water-only cycloning helps froth flotation performance. The hypothesis is that water-only cycloning scrubs the surface of the unreacted limestone.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the SPS as LHC injector has been limited, with LHC-type beams, by the electron cloud multipacting for high bunch intensities (> 6. 0 x 10 ** 10 protons/bunch). To study in detail the dependence of the electron cloud on the beam parameters (bunch intensity, filling pattern, filling factor [...] .), three strip-detectors have been installed inside dipole corrector magnets. The measuring set-up was completed by shielded pick-ups and by an in-situ secondary electron yield detector installed in field-free regions. This paper presents the variation of the electron cloud activity {{as a function of}} the bunch intensity and bunch length, filling pattern and filling factor. The spatial and energy distributions of the electrons in the cloud were studied and the latter compared with results obtained with a conventional retarding field detector.

30|$|The {{result of}} the {{temporal}} variation in the HCl/SO 2 ratios, together with those of volcanic gas by FT-IR spectroscopy since 1996, are compared to the variation in the “water amount of the crater lake” in Fig. 2; JMA reports {{the proportion of the}} lake surface area relative to the maximum lake surface area as the “water amount of the crater lake”. High and intermediate HCl/SO 2 ratios are observed during the periods of low water level, while low HCl/SO 2 ratios are observed during the periods of high water level. In addition, high HCl/SO 2 ratios, except for those in 2005, roughly correlate with a high fumarole temperature represented by the temperature of the southern crater wall, which is considered to reflect largely the volcanic heat transfer to the summit area. These relations {{can be explained by the}} interaction of volcanic gas emission with the hydrothermal system beneath the crater, assuming that the water level in the crater is an indicator of the amount of water in the hydrothermal system. Mori and Notsu (2008) reported that the low HQ/SO 2 ratio during the period of high water level is explained by the scrubbing of HCl off the volcanic gas in the hydrothermal system, because HCl is more soluble in water compared with SO 2. The <b>scrubbing</b> <b>effect</b> of HCl depends on the amount of water interacting with the volcanic gas and the intensity of volcanic gas emission (i.e. the total flux of volcanic gas supplied to the summit area). Either a decreasing amount of water, or an intensification of gas emission, or both, decrease the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>effect</b> by shortening the interaction time of bubbling gas and water. In a shorter interaction time, the gas passing through the water loses less HCl by dissolution into the water. That is, during inactive periods, in which gas emission is weak with less heat transfer and enough water remains, HCl is mostly scrubbed off the volcanic gas and the residual gas with a low HCl/SO 2 ratio is emitted into the air. On the contrary, during active periods, in which an intense gas emission occurs accompanied by much heat transfer, and the amount of water decreases due to the heat, volcanic gas with a high HCl/SO 2 ratio is emitted into the air because little HCl is scrubbed off. This interpretation is consistent with the variation in SO 2 flux by JMA ([URL] which started in March, 2007. The SO 2 flux showed an increasing trend from 2007 to 2011, corresponding to the increasing trend in the HCl/SO 2 ratio, although the short-term correlation between them is not clear, partly due to the difference in the observation methods.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the design, manufacturing, and testing of a {{propeller}} for a general aviation aircraft fuelled by hydrogen. The feasibility of the ENFICA-FC project depended on several key-enabling technologies. In order to minimize the power required from both the batteries and the fuel cell, a highly efficient electrical propulsion system was required, {{in which all the}} components would need to yield the highest possible efficiency. The choice of the propeller for this specific aircraft was more difficult, above all because the electric motor was limited as to the torque it could handle. In addition, the propeller would also have to provide the necessary airflow for the motor, electronics, and fuel cell cooling to ensure that the temperature did not exceed the limits imposed by the manufacturer. Although a designer may be aided by modern numerical design and analysis programmes to optimize propellers, structural and manufacturing constraints can influence the final choices. Finally, the calculated performance would always have to be validated with experimental tests. An optimal propeller has been designed and manufactured to be installed on the Rapid 200 FC aeroplane. Static tests on the manufactured two-blade propeller were performed by means of a static test facility. Specific tests have also been performed to check the efficiency of the propeller when installation <b>effects</b> (blockage and <b>scrubbing</b> drag <b>effects)</b> are included and to verify the real efficiency of the propulsion and cooling systems, with the propeller installed in the complete converted aircraft.

30|$|Urbanization is {{increasing}} rapidly {{in developing countries}} and is predicted to sizably enhance the atmospheric deposition of pollutant aerosols to cities and down-wind (Pandey et al. 2013). Lovett et al. (2000) suggested that urban atmosphere acts as a scrubber removing aerosols and vapors with dust and depositing them {{in and around the}} cities. For this reason, atmospheric deposition generally declines with distance from the city. The scrubbing effects of urban atmosphere may be further enhanced by the large mass of water along the city as the case of Ganga River in the present study. Further, the insoluble mineral particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and consequently enhance the overall deposition (Yin et al. 2002). In the present study, the AD-OC increased with proximity to urban core. Further, the particulate emission derived from site-specific activities (cooking, abraded streets, vehicle frequency, building construction, excavation and nearby agricultural lands), which are continuously rising due to population coupled urban development, may generate strong local control. The Mann–Kendall test and the Sen’s slope estimates showed significant seasonality with increasing AD-OC over the year. The variances in the residuals were almost constant. Intra-annual trends in AD-OC indicated long-range transport during summer, offsite scavenging during monsoon and enhanced deposition rates during winter season (Lohse et al. 2008). As reported elsewhere (Lohse et al. 2008; Murillo et al. 2013), OC deposition showed the influence of urban emission and <b>scrubbing</b> <b>effect</b> and peaked in winter likely because of source effects coupled with low temperature, calm wind, low mixing heights and concurrent formation of inversion layer in winter season.|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} {{a summary of the}} work {{presented}} in Refs. [1]. In the following, we present the main topics dis-cussed on it. For more information, see the aforementioned article and references therein. SUMMARY Within the framework of the CERN program on elec-tron cloud effects in accelerators, a coaxial multipacting test stand was built. In order to simulate bunched beam, the test stand is subjected to short rf pulses. The field strength in a traveling wave mode is sufficient to trigger multipact-ing in “as received ” surfaces, but not in chambers treated to reduce the secondary emission yield. A number of upgrades in the bench setup have been pur-sued, mainly in two directions: • general reduction in mismatching (i. e., electrical losses) amongst the different parts of the setup. • instead of dumping the pulsed power into a load, it is recirculated by means of a broadband working regime resonant ring. Reference [1] shows the steps required to build this trav-eling waves resonant ring: improvements on the chamber and implementation of the coupler. CONCLUSIONS The traveling waves resonant ring was finally built through the: • electrical and mechanical improvements on the setup. The system attenuation was reduced to less than 0. 5 dB. • the “ad-hoc ” λ/ 4 symmetric 9 -sections wideband di-rectional coupler was successfully designed and built. Its coupling factor is measured to be C ∼ 9 dB, with a reasonably ripple. The total power enhancement was finnally 9 dB (factor 3 in voltage). This allows for larger multipacting electron energies: from energies of about 75 eV using the origi-nal setup, we managed to obtain electron energies of about 200 eV. This allows to trigger multipacting in chambers with low SEY, to study the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>effect,</b> and test sur-face coatings: for instance the new enamel solutions [2, 3]...|$|E

40|$|The {{removal of}} {{plutonium}} from Nevada Test Site (NTS) area soils {{has previously been}} attempted using various combinations of attrition scrubbing, size classification, gravity based separation, flotation, air flotation, segmented gate, bioremediation, magnetic separation and vitrification. Results were less than encouraging, but the processes were not fully optimized. To support additional vendor treatability studies soil from the Clean Slate II site (located on the Tonopah Test Range, north of the NTS) were characterized and tested. These particular soils from the NTS are contaminated primarily with plutonium- 239 / 240 and Am- 241. Soils were characterized for Pu- 239 / 240, Am- 241 and gross alpha. In addition, wet sieving and the subsequent characterization were performed on soils before and after attrition scrubbing to determine the particle size distribution {{and the distribution of}} Pu- 239 / 240 and gross alpha as a function of particle size. Sequential extraction was performed on untreated soil to provide information about how tightly bound the plutonium was to the soil. Magnetic separation was performed to determine if this could be useful as part of a treatment approach. The results indicate that about a 40 % volume reduction of contaminated soil should be achievable by removing the > 300 um size fraction of the soil. Attrition <b>scrubbing</b> does not <b>effect</b> particle size distribution, but does result in a slight shift of plutonium distribution to the fines. As such, attrition scrubbing may be able to slightly increase the ability to separate plutonium-contaminated particles from clean soil. This could add another 5 - 10 % to the mass of the clean soil, bringing the total clean soil to 45 - 50 %. Additional testing would be needed to determine the value of using attrition scrubbing as well as screening the soil through a sieve size slightly smaller than 300 um. Since only attrition scrubbing and wet sieving would be needed to attain this, {{it would be good to}} conduct this investigation. Magnetic separation did not work well. The sequential extraction studies indicated that a significant amount of plutonium was soluble in the ''organic'' and ''resistant'' extracts. As such chemical extraction based on these or similar extractants should also be considered as a possible treatment approach...|$|R
40|$|The work {{reported}} here was carried-out on {{the invitation of}} Dr. Henry Kumm, Director of the Rockefeller Foundation, and by appointment from Dr. Henrique Aragão, Director of the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz. It was done during the investigation of sylvan yellow fever, in June 1947, {{with a view to}} establishing the phyto-ecological conditions of the county of Passos. The pe¬riod was, however, too short for definite conclusions to be reached. Thanks are due to Dr. O. R. Causey, Chief of Research on Yellow Fever for transpor¬tation and other help. THE REGIONAL VEGETATION. Aerial photographs of the county of Passos shoto that it is covered by three great types of vegetation: Rain Forest, Secondary Pasture Land and Scrub. 1 Detailed investigation, however, brings out the fact that these correspond to different seres; furthermore, each type presents not only the specific, characteristics of the biological form dominant for the climate, but also are at various stages, which express HABITATS differing from those of the normal sere. The phytogeographic survey of the region shows that most of it is now covered by secondary pasture land (disclimax) in which Melinis minutiflora, v. "fat grass" (fig. 1), predominates. The mosaic of Rain Forest and of small patches of <b>Scrub</b> reveals the <b>effects</b> of human intervention (BARRETO, H. L. de Mello 1); consequently, all the formations have to be regarded as secon¬dary, though some of them probably include relicts of the primitive climax (WARMING, E. 2). On close examination, the Scrub cannot be considered as the climax, because of the following facts: 1. In the zone of Rain-Forest stretches of forest are present in very varied topographic conditions and the reconstitution of the associations show that man has destroyed an ecological unit (fig. 2). 2. In the zone of Scrub the characteristic patches are small. The banks of rivers and brooks, the valleys and ravine and whatever the soil has retained some humidity, is being invaded fry Rain Forest, which seems to be growing under optimum conditions. The Scrub is thus limited to small belts on the calcareous mountains and on sandy soils with alcaline depths (pH abo¬ve 7) which do not retain enough moisture for the Rain Forest that is progres¬sively restricting the area occupied by Scrub. In view of the topographic and present climatic conditions the Rain Forest must consequently be regarded as the regional climax. The presence of ecologically contradictory elements and associations shows that {{the real problem is that}} of the fluctuations of the climate of Passos or even of Minas Geraes during the quaternary and recent periods (DAN-SEREAU, P. : 3), a subject on which little is known and which is tied to the evolution of the climate of Brazil (OLIVEIRA, E. : 4). The transformation of Scrub into Rain Forest has been - observed by the author before, in other parts of Brazil (VELOSO, PL P. : 5). It seems probable that the Rio Grande has also greatly influenced the change of the regional vegetation, by invading areas of Scrub and dislocating the limit of the Pluvial climate towards the Canastra Range, though there are remnants of Scrub (postclimax) transfor¬med into secondary open country (disclimax, fig. 5) by human devastation and the setting of fire to the land. VEGETATION GROUPS OF THE PLUVIAL TYPE. The map of the region also shows that at the present time the small patches of forest (whether devasted or intact) occupy the least accessible places, such as valleys, peaks and abrupt slopes (fig. 2). Even these are now being destroyed, so that in the near future this forested region will be en¬tirely reduced to poor pasture land unless energetic measures of conservation are undertaken in time. The Special Service for Prophylaxis against Yellow Fever installed two of their four Stations for the Capture of Mosquitos in this area, one of them at Batatal and the other at Cachoeira, which have separate formations each of them composed of several associations. Other vegetation formations were also analysed, from the synecological point of view, so as to ascertain of which degree of succession their associations belong. These phytosociological sur¬veys give an idea of the principal characteristics of each station. BATATAL FORMATION. The abrupt nature of the valley has rendered this location inappropriate for agricultural purposes since colonial times. The relict of the primitive forest climax saved by this circumstance has expanded gradually to zones whose paedologic conditions favour the eatablishment of mesophilous species. The aerial photograph shows two small stretches of forest, one apparently primi¬tive, the other composed of associations belonging to the subclimax of the subsere. CACHOEIRA FORMATION. Aerial photographs show that this station is crossed by a small river, which divides it into two separate parts. The first, which presents ecological conditions similar, though not identical to those of Batatal, is favoured by topography and apparently remains primitive forest. Though the topography of the other, on the whole, favours the establishment of groups belonging to the normal sere of the climax, is has been partly devastated recently and the aspect of the associations has been completely modified. It was is this part that the four posts for the capturing of mosquitos were set up. The first forest is favoured by deposition of organic matter, washed out from the nearby devasted areas by torrential rains, and thus provides, an appropriate HABITAT for the climax species with certain hygrophilous trends of the ecological quasiclimax type. This association seems to have reached a biological equilibrium, as the dominates. Gallesia gorarema and Cariniana legalis (fig. 10), present an optimum vitality with a vigorous habit and a normal evolutionary cycle. The Cariniantum legalis Gallesiosum equilibrium, corresponds however, to a provisory association, because if the moving of soil by torrential rains should cease it would become possible...|$|R
