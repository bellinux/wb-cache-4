50|$|Extending {{the shelf}} life <b>of</b> roasted <b>coffee</b> relies on {{maintaining}} an optimum environment {{to protect it}} from exposure to heat, oxygen, and light. Roasted coffee has an optimal typical shelf life of two weeks, and ground coffee about 15 minutes. Without some <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> preservation method, <b>coffee</b> becomes stale. The first large-scale preservation technique was vacuum packing in cans. However, because coffee emits CO2 after roasting, coffee to be vacuum-packed must be allowed to de-gas for several days before it is sealed. To allow more immediate packaging, pressurized canisters or foil-lined bags with pressure-relief valves can be used. Refrigeration and freezing retards the staling process. Roasted whole beans can be considered fresh for up to one month if kept cool. Once coffee is ground it is best used immediately.|$|R
40|$|Kaffee ist ein sehr populäres und geschätztes Genussmittel, das einen großen Anteil an der Aufnahme von Antioxidantien, welche Schutz vor ernährungsassoziierten Krankheiten bieten können, in der Bevölkerung stellt. Da zahlreiche Studien, die den Einfluss der Lagerung auf ausgewählte Inhaltsstoffe, das anitoxidativie Potential und die sensorischen Eigenschaften von Kaffee untersuchen, in diesem Umfang nicht vorhanden sind, war es interessant im Rahmen der vorliegenden Diplomarbeit herauszufinden, ob es während der Lagerung zu Veränderungen ausgewählter Parameter im Kaffee kommt. Es wurden Coffein, Chlorogensäure und Theobromin mittels High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) und die Totale Antioxidative Kapazität (TAC) photometrisch mit der ABTS-Methode, von je einer Arabica-Sorte (Äthiopien Limu) und einer Robusta-Sorte (Vietnam), zubereitet als Filterkaffee, jeden Monat während der 9 -monatigen Lagerung untersucht. Des Weiteren wurden mittels Quantitativer Deskriptiver Analyse (QDA) die sensorischen Eigenschaften von Arabica- und Robusta-Kaffee gleich nach der Röstung und am Ende der 9 Monate dauernden Lagerung verfolgt. Bei den laborchemischen Analysen, die im Zuge der vorliegenden Diplomarbeit durchgeführt wurden, konnte eine Veränderung der Kaffee-Inhaltsstoffe über einen Zeitraum von 9 Monaten festgestellt werden. Diese Änderungen hatten wiederum Einfluss auf die sensorischen Eigenschaften der untersuchten Kaffeesorten. Die erstellten Produktprofile vom frisch gerösteten und 9 Monate gelagerten Kaffee zeigten eine deutliche Zu- bzw. Abnahme in der Intensität positiver bzw. negativer Attribute, die für die sensorische Qualität von Kaffee {{relevant}} sind. Somit konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Lagerung einen gravierenden Einfluss auf Kaffee und dessen Inhaltsstoffe hat. {{is one of}} the world´s {{most popular}} and valued beverage. There are two coffee tree species, which are cultivated worldwide, i. e. Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora var. Robusta. Coffee, which is a favoured natural stimulant, has a substantial contingent on the intake of antioxidants in the population, which provides protection against food associated diseases. Studies, which determine the influence of storing on several components, the antioxidative potential and sensory properties <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> are rarely available. Therefore, it was highly interesting to research within the framework of this existing diploma thesis, whether there is a change on certain parameters during a storage period <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> The selected ingredients like caffeine, chlorogenic acid and theobromin <b>of</b> two <b>coffee</b> species, Arabica coffee from Ethiopia (growing area: Limu) as well as Robusta coffee from Vietnam were analysed by a reverse-phase HPLC/UV detector method. Furthermore, the Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) was determined photometrically using the ABTS-method. Both were freshly roasted in March 2009, packed in commercially available packages and were instantly brewed monthly throughout a period of storage (9 months). In addition, the sensory attributes from the two coffees (Arabica and Robusta) were analysed by Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA) immediately after roasting in March 2009 and at th end of the storing in December 2009. The chemical analyses, which were carried out {{in the course of this}} diploma thesis, demonstrated a substantial change <b>of</b> the <b>coffee</b> ingredients over a period of 9 months. These alterations of the constituents had a remarkable influence on the sensory properties <b>of</b> the reviewed <b>coffees.</b> The developed product profiles of the freshly roasted <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> opposed to the 9 month duration of storage showed a clear increase respectively decrease in the intensity of positive as well as negative attributes, which are responsible for the sensory quality <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> Therefore, it was made evident by this thesis, that storing has a serious influence on coffee and its ingredients. ...|$|R
