25|$|Accelerators are {{a form of}} selection-based search {{which allow}} a user to invoke an online service from any other page using only the mouse. Actions such as {{selecting}} the text or other objects will give users access to the usable Accelerator services (such as blogging with the <b>selected</b> <b>text,</b> or viewing a map of a selected geographical location), which can then be invoked with the selected object. According to Microsoft, Accelerators eliminate the need to copy and paste content between web pages. IE8 specifies an XML-based encoding which allows a web application or web service to be invoked as an Accelerator service. How the service will be invoked and for what categories of content it will show up are specified in the XML file. Similarities have been drawn between Accelerators and the controversial Smart tags feature experimented with in the IE 6 Beta but withdrawn after criticism (though later included in MS Office).|$|E

2500|$|The new Mini Toolbar {{is a small}} toolbar {{with basic}} {{formatting}} commands that appears within the document editing area, much like a context menu. When the mouse selects part of the text, Mini Toolbar appears close to <b>selected</b> <b>text.</b> It remains semi-transparent until the mouse pointer is hovered on it, to avoid obstructing what is underneath. Mini Toolbar can also be made to appear by right-clicking in the editing area or via [...] key on keyboard, in which case it appears near the cursor, above or below the traditional context menu. Mini Toolbar is not customizable in Office 2007, but can be turned off.|$|E
60|$|As to a {{selection}} of the text from various editions, this would doubtless be the best plan, were it a practicable one; and perhaps it may be attainable some day. But Wordsworth is as yet too near us for such an editorial treatment of his Works to be successful. The fundamental objection to it is that scarcely two minds--even among the most competent of contemporary judges--will agree {{as to what the}} best text is. An edition arranged on this principle could not possibly be acceptable to more than a few persons. Of course no arrangement of any kind can escape adverse criticism: it would be most unfortunate if it did. But this particular edition would fail in its main purpose, if questions of individual taste were made primary, and not secondary; and an arrangement, which gave scope for the arbitrary selection of particular texts,--according to the wisdom, or the want of wisdom, of the editor,--would deservedly meet with severe criticism in many quarters. Besides, such a method of arrangement would not indicate the growth of the Poet's mind, and the development of his genius. If an editor wished to indicate his own opinion of the best text for each poem--under the idea that his judgment might be of some use to other people--it would be wiser to do so by means of some mark or marginal note, than by printing his <b>selected</b> <b>text</b> in {{the main body of the}} work. He could thus at once preserve the chronological order of the readings, indicate his own preference, and leave it to others to select what they preferred. Besides, the compiler of such an edition would often find himself in doubt as to what the best text really was, the merit of the different readings being sometimes almost equal, or very nearly balanced; and, were he to endeavour to get out of the difficulty by obtaining the judgments of literary men, or even of contemporary poets, he would find that their opinions would in most cases be dissimilar, if they did not openly conflict. Those who cannot come to a final decision as to their own text would not be likely to agree as to the merits of particular readings in the poems of their predecessors. Unanimity of opinion on this point is indeed quite unattainable.|$|E
50|$|The Speak <b>selected</b> <b>text</b> when key {{is pressed}} feature allows <b>selected</b> <b>text</b> from any {{application}} {{to be read}} via a key combination. From Mac OS X 10.1 to Mac OS X 10.6, the feature would copy the <b>selected</b> <b>text</b> to the clipboard and read it from there. From Mac OS X 10.7 to Mac OS X 10.10, a new implementation of the feature required software developers to implement a speech synthesis API into their applications. This prevented the clipboard from being overwritten, but also meant that, for applications that {{did not use the}} API, the feature would not function as expected, reading the title bar rather than the <b>selected</b> <b>text.</b>|$|E

50|$|A new Mini Translator feature {{allows users}} to {{translate}} <b>selected</b> <b>text</b> in OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word. Translations for phrases or words are displayed within a tooltip, from which users can hear an audio pronunciation of the <b>selected</b> <b>text</b> provided {{by one of the}} Microsoft text-to-speech voices installed on a machine, copy the translation to the clipboard {{so that it can be}} inserted into another document, or view a definition provided by an online service if the <b>selected</b> <b>text</b> is a word. The audio pronunciations are made available through a Speak feature, which can be accessed separately from the Mini Translator (e.g., added to the ribbon), but it can only be activated if a text-to-speech engine that matches the language of the <b>selected</b> <b>text</b> is installed. Users can download various text-to-speech engines from Microsoft. The Speak feature is not available when Office 2010 is installed on Windows XP.|$|E
