500|$|Post was {{released}} on 13 June 1995, as a 12" [...] record, CD, and compact cassette. It was issued on One Little Indian Records in the United Kingdom and Elektra Records in the United States and Canada; Polydor Records issued Post in Australia and Japan, also releasing the European edition of the album. Lead single [...] "Army of Me" [...] {{was released}} on 21 April 1995, shortly after the album's production concluded. It was released in the United Kingdom as two different CD releases, with [...] "Cover Me", [...] "You've Been Flirting Again", [...] "Sweet Intuition", and various remixes as its B-sides. It debuted at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming her first UK Top 10 single. Although it {{dropped out of the}} Top 20 the next week, [...] "Army of Me" [...] remained in the Top 75 for five weeks. The ending of [...] "Army of Me" [...] music video depicted Björk bombing an art museum, and due to a recent terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City, MTV removed it from its playlist before it even aired. Within weeks it was broadcast, although this [...] "foreshadowed a string of unlucky events that would further hinder Posts unveiling". An unsourced sample by Robin Rimbaud, prominently heard throughout [...] "Possibly Maybe", resulted in a lawsuit demanding a co-songwriter credit. After Rimbaud's label New Electronica refused Birkett's <b>standard</b> <b>sample</b> clearance compensation of £1,000, he and Björk resolved to destroy over 100,000 copies of the album, and [...] "remixing, remastering, and reprinting a new version". However, and at the request of Rimbaud, New Electronica later let Björk use his sample completely free of charge, meaning One Little Indian did not have to issue another version after all, since stores had yet to run out of stock of Post initial run. Björk was also due back in court as a witness in Simon Fisher's lawsuit against Nellee Hooper and herself (regarding Debuts writing credits), charges that were eventually cleared by judge Robin Jacob. Author Mark Pytlik writes: [...] "The strange combination of events had conspired to form the strangest promotional tour anyone could have ever envisioned: in the week since Post had been released, Björk had seen her album deleted, her video banned, and two separate lawsuits brought against her". One Little Indian were also better prepared to promote the album, scheduling a string of European and American tour dates from the beginning of July into late August.|$|E

40|$|Wear {{resistant}} coatings can {{be produced}} by different kind of PVD and CVD processes. User specified special requirements for different industrial applications ask for a stingent quality control. Therefore test methods must be standarized. In addition {{the quality of the}} tests must be guaranteed by <b>standard</b> <b>samples.</b> To analyse the test methods and for the development of <b>standard</b> <b>samples</b> steel samples were coated by PVD and CVD with hard coating (TiN_x, Ti_x(C_yN_z), (Ti_xAl_y) N_z). Chemical composition, hardness and adhesion were evaluated in round robins to verify the sample properties and examine the test methods. Well-known research institutes were involved to guarantee best valuation of the samples and the used analytical methods. As a result the comparability of methods for spectroscopical chemical analysis was improved by the <b>standard</b> <b>samples.</b> The composition of the <b>standard</b> <b>samples</b> could be evaluated by wet chemistry. So the calibration of the quantitative analysis was possible. Hardness measurements (Vickers method and load displacement indentation method) show a high hardness of the samples and small deviations in the round robins. Especially the load displacement indentation method is useful for hardness measurements at thin hard coatings, because systematic disturbances can be corrected to give best comparability. The scratch test for adhesion measurements is still far away from being standardized. In the round robins the measured critical loads were quite different. On the other hand for different coatings the tendency of the criticcal loads was comparable. The <b>standard</b> <b>samples</b> locate the remaining problems at the test machine and at the interpretation of coating damage. So they will give some impulses for the further development of the scratch test as an adhesion test method. (orig.)
