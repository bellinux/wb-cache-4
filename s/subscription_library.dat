5|$|To {{support the}} household, in late 1874 Coolbrith took a {{position}} as the librarian for the Oakland Library Association, a <b>subscription</b> <b>library</b> that had been established five years earlier. In 1878, the library was reformed as the Oakland Free Library, the second public library created in California under the Rogers Free Library Act (Eureka was first). Coolbrith earned a salary of $80 per month, much less than a man would have received. She worked 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. Her poetry suffered as a result. She published only sporadically over the next 19 years—working as Oakland's librarian was the low point of her poetic career.|$|E
5|$|Until 1902 the Portland Public Library, {{which started}} as a reading room for sailors {{and then as a}} <b>subscription</b> <b>library,</b> was housed in the {{building}}. In 1928, the city began {{one of a series of}} renovations on the building to increase floor space. That year one of the two light wells were filled in, blocking off natural light to the lower floors. The city added a new elevator in 1931. The next remodel started in 1933, and lasted through 1937. During this construction the second light well was filled in for more space, and a penthouse apartment was built on top of the roof.|$|E
25|$|PLCH traces {{its roots}} to a <b>subscription</b> <b>library</b> {{that began in}} 1802. On March 14, 1853, it became the Cincinnati Public Library. Since its founding, the library has {{occupied}} several locations, including its current location at Eighth Street and Vine Street.|$|E
50|$|Circulating <b>libraries</b> charged <b>subscription</b> fees {{to users}} and offered serious subject matter {{as well as}} the popular novels, thus the {{difficulty}} in clearly distinguishing circulating from <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries.</b> Occasionally <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries</b> called themselves 'circulating libraries', and vice versa.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{complicated}} to precisely define circulating libraries and specifically what separates them from {{other types of}} libraries. In the time period of circulating libraries, there were other <b>libraries,</b> such as <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries,</b> that operated {{in a similar fashion}} but were not the same. However, when both types of libraries were commonplace, the terms circulating <b>libraries</b> and <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries</b> “were completely interchangeable." [...] It was logical that they were considered to be the same since both libraries circulated books and charged a <b>subscription</b> fee. The <b>libraries</b> differed in their intent. Circulating libraries’ intent was financial gain, and <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries</b> intended to obtain literary and scholarly works to share with others.|$|R
50|$|Private <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries</b> held {{a greater}} amount of control over both {{membership}} {{and the types of}} books in the library. There was almost a complete elimination of cheap fiction in the private societies. <b>Subscription</b> <b>libraries</b> prided themselves on respectability. The highest percentage of subscribers were often landed proprietors, gentry, and old professions.|$|R
25|$|In 1897, a {{group of}} women in Alexandria formed the Alexandria Library Association. The leaders of the group were Virginia Corse, Mrs. William B. Smoot, and Virginia Burke. They petitioned the school board to open a <b>subscription</b> <b>library</b> in Peabody Hall, using the old books stored there. Permission was given and doors to the new <b>subscription</b> <b>library</b> opened on December 1, 1897. In 1902, the library moved to the first floor of a house in the 1300 block of Prince Street while {{negotiations}} were underway for a permanent move to the Confederate Hall, located at 806 Prince Street. In May 1903, the library moved to the Confederate Hall, now known as the Robert E. Lee Camp Hall Museum, where it stayed for 34 years.|$|E
25|$|The Footscray Mechanics' Institute Inc. was {{established}} in 1857, and has operated a library in Nicholson Street since 1913. The library is a low cost <b>subscription</b> <b>library,</b> which is open 5 days a week, closed Weekends, Public Holidays and for 3–4 weeks over the Christmas/New Year period.|$|E
25|$|On January 27, 1848 the Young Men’s Library Association of Augusta {{was formed}} {{with the goal}} of {{establishing}} a library and accompanying reading room with newspapers and periodicals. This library was also run as a <b>subscription</b> <b>library</b> at the cost of either $50 for a lifetime membership, or $5 per year.|$|E
50|$|In 1796, {{the state}} {{legislature}} enacted a law providing {{for the establishment of}} local private <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{increase}} in secular literature {{at this time}} encouraged the spread of lending libraries, especially the commercial <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries.</b> Many small, private book clubs evolved into <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries,</b> charging high annual fees or requiring subscribing members to purchase shares in the libraries. The materials available to subscribers {{tended to focus on}} particular subject areas, such as biography, history, philosophy, theology, and travel, rather than works of fiction, particularly the novel.|$|R
50|$|The {{increasing}} {{production and}} demand for fiction promoted by commercial markets led {{to the rise of}} circulating libraries, which met a need that <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries</b> did not fulfil. William Bathoe claimed that his commercial venture was ‘the Original Circulating library’, opening doors at two locations in London in 1737. Circulating <b>libraries</b> also charged <b>subscription</b> fees to users and offered serious subject matter as well as the popular novels, thus the difficulty in clearly distinguishing circulating from <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Peterborough Mechanics Institute, {{established}} in 1868, housed a <b>subscription</b> <b>library</b> that allowed members who paid a fee to borrow books. Mechanics Institutes were established across Ontario to make education universal and {{accessible to all}} citizens. In Peterborough, the Institute and the Library were located on Water Street. In May 1895, the Mechanics Institute became the Peterborough Public Library. The library remained on Water Street.|$|E
25|$|This did not suffice, however. Franklin {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a <b>subscription</b> <b>library,</b> which would pool the funds of the members to buy books for all to read. This was the birth of the Library Company of Philadelphia: its charter was composed by Franklin in 1731. In 1732, Franklin hired the first American librarian, Louis Timothee. The Library Company is now a great scholarly and research library.|$|E
25|$|In November 1919, Bell was an {{invited speaker}} {{at a meeting}} for the {{promotion}} of a public library in Baghdad, and subsequently served on its Library Committee, as President from 1921 to 1924. The Baghdad Peace Library (Maktabat al-Salam) was a private, <b>subscription</b> <b>library,</b> but in c.1924 was taken over by the Ministry of Education and became known as the Baghdad Public Library (or sometimes as the General Library). In 1961, this became the National Library of Iraq.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of free public {{libraries}} in the 19th century, most <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries</b> were replaced or {{taken over by the}} governing authorities.|$|R

2500|$|As Brighton grew {{beyond its}} {{historic}} centre in the 19th century, small <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries</b> (many of them short-lived) opened elsewhere: on East Street, Middle Street and Ship Street in The Lanes; St James's Street and High Street in the Kemptown area; Queen's Road and Gardner Street in the North Laine area near Brighton railway station; Preston Street, Norfolk Square, Western Road and King's Road on the West Cliff {{to the west}} of the Steine; and in the poor Carlton Hill area. [...] <b>Subscription</b> <b>libraries</b> declined in popularity in the 20th century, but one survived until 1975 on Lewes Road.|$|R
25|$|The Leadhills Miners' Library (also {{known as}} the Allan Ramsay Library or the Leadhills Reading Society), founded in 1741 by 21 miners, the local schoolteacher and the local minister, {{specifically}} to purchase a collection of books for its members’ mutual improvement — its membership was not restricted to the miners; several non-miners, such as William Symington, John Brown (author of Rab and his Friends) and James Braid, were also full members — houses an extensive antiquarian book collection, local relics, mining records and minerals. The library is the oldest <b>subscription</b> <b>library</b> in the British Isles; and is of significant historical and geological importance.|$|E
25|$|The first {{library in}} Lawrence {{was started in}} October 1854 and was a <b>subscription</b> <b>library</b> costing $1 a year. After the Lawrence Massacre {{destroyed}} the library, a new one was started in 1865 and placed under city jurisdiction in 1871. In 1902, Peter Emery successfully got a grant from Andrew Carnegie {{to build a new}} library at 9th and Vermont Streets. The Lawrence Public Library opened in 1904. A new library to replace the aging and outdated Carnegie Building was completed in 1972 at 7th and Vermont Streets with voters approving a bond issue in 2010 to expand and update the building. During construction, the library moved to 7th and New Hampshire in the former Borders bookstore. The new library opened in July 2014.|$|E
25|$|The {{predecessor}} of Minneapolis's {{public library}} {{was a private}} library called the Minneapolis Athenæum. It was organized by Minneapolis businessmen in 1859 as a <b>subscription</b> <b>library,</b> and its shares were traded on the local stock market. After T. B. Walker moved to Minneapolis he bought shares in the Athenæum and gave away memberships to it, promoting {{the idea of a}} free public library for the city. Other stock holders raised objections, but the technique worked and soon the city financed a free library for the public with a one mill property tax. When the Minneapolis Public Library was established in 1885 the Athenæum became a partner of it and still exists as a separate nonprofit organization sharing space with the library.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a number of}} interesting parallels between circulating libraries in England circa 1725 - 1850 and video rental stores in the U. S. circa 1980 - 1990. Both institutions evolved in a similar manner, which suggests that common economic and social forces were at work. Perhaps the histories of these two industries may be helpful in understanding current and future developments in computer- and Internet-related media. According to Loomis [1994], p. 608, “ [...] . the history of libraries, particularly in the United States and Great Britain, during the 18 th and much of 19 th centuries is dominated by <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries.</b> ” He distinguishes three types of subscription libraries: book clubs, private <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries,</b> and commercial circulating libraries. Book clubs were essentially discussion groups and did not maintain permanent collections. Private <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries</b> were primarily the “ [...] . purview of an affluent minority ” that “attempted to collect standard works of permanent value in history, biography, travel, ∗ Research support from NSF grants 9320481 and 9979852 and is gratefully acknowledged...|$|R

25|$|John Wise, a local Alexandria {{businessman}} and hotel keeper, hosted {{a meeting in}} his home in 1789 to discuss {{the creation of a}} Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge. Members include Rev. James Muir, physician Elisha Cullen Dick, and George Washington's personal attorney Charles Lee. The Society did not last for long. However, on July 24, 1794, the founders of the Society once again met at Wise's home to establish a <b>subscription</b> <b>library.</b> During the first year, one hundred nineteen men joined the circulating library which was to be called the Library Company of Alexandria. Members agreed to pay an initiation fee and annual dues. The company was chartered as a corporation in 1798 in an act passed by the General Assembly of Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Druggist Edward Stabler {{was elected}} the first {{librarian}} and the library's first location {{is believed to}} have been housed in his apothecary shop. James Kennedy was elected the second librarian, and the library moved to his residence and place of business. Kennedy sold books from his personal collection to the Library Company. Those books and other bought from two local merchants formed the foundation of the <b>subscription</b> <b>library.</b> The first catalog of the library's collection was published in 1797. The collection grew over time, bolstered in part by the fact that some members paid their dues in books. Most members were initially men, although records exist showing some women were members as early as 1798. One noted female member in 1817 was Mary L.F. Custis, wife of George Washington Parke Custis.|$|E
500|$|The city's first <b>subscription</b> <b>library</b> {{opened in}} 1794. In 1893 the first free public library, the York Library, {{was built to}} mark Queen Victoria's jubilee.

50|$|<b>Subscription</b> <b>libraries</b> were {{democratic}} in nature; {{created by}} and for communities of local subscribers who aimed to establish permanent collections of books and reading materials, rather than selling their collections annually as the circulating libraries tended to do, {{in order to raise}} funds to support their other commercial interests. Even though the <b>subscription</b> <b>libraries</b> were often founded by reading societies, committees, elected by the subscribers, chose books for the collection that were general, rather than aimed at a particular religious, political or professional group. The books selected for the collection were chosen because they would be mutually beneficial to the shareholders. The committee also selected the librarians who would manage the circulation of materials.|$|R

It was designed of Georgian / Federal styles of architecture and designed [...] by the early famous city architect Robert Cary Long, Sr. Built of two stories of brick with stone trim, and a slight pitched roof with a central pediment facing Fayette Street. In its later social declining years, by 1835, a third floor with a short balustrade around the roof ledge was added giving it a flat roof, which was its appearance when municipal interest was shown, and purchased by the city in 1843 for $23,000 dollars for use by its new type of elevated school.|$|E
