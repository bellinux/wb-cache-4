However, a crucial question remains {{as to how the}} repertoire of distinctly modified microtubules is generated. We propose here an ubiquitous mechanism of spatial and temporal differentiation of microtubules. In this model, the diversity of post-translational modifications results from a dynamical pathway separation which is ensured by biochemical switches between <b>self-regulated</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of differentiation. Thus, it does not require any hypothetical subcellular compartmentalization of enzymatic activities responsible for the various post-translational modifications. These results are discussed in relation to experimental evidences for a temporal and spatial regulation of microtubule modifications...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{believed}} that spirals in pure stellar disks, especially the ones spontaneously formed, decay in several galactic rotations {{due to the}} increase of stellar velocity dispersions. Therefore, some cooling mechanism, for example dissipational effects of the interstellar medium, {{was assumed to be}} necessary to keep the spiral arms. Here we show that stellar disks can maintain spiral features for several tens of rotations without the help of cooling, using a series of high-resolution three-dimensional N-body simulations of pure stellar disks. We found that if the number of particles is sufficiently large, e. g., 3 × 10 ^ 6, multi-arm spirals developed in an isolated disk can survive for more than 10 Gyrs. We confirmed that there is a <b>self-regulating</b> <b>mechanism</b> that maintains the amplitude of the spiral arms. Spiral arms increase Toomre's Q of the disk, and the heating rate correlates with the squared amplitude of the spirals. Since the amplitude itself is limited by the value of Q, this makes the dynamical heating less effective in the later phase of evolution. A simple analytical argument suggests that the heating is caused by gravitational scattering of stars by spiral arms, and that the <b>self-regulating</b> <b>mechanism</b> in pure-stellar disks can effectively maintain spiral arms on a cosmological timescale. In the case of a smaller number of particles, e. g., 3 × 10 ^ 5, spiral arms grow faster {{in the beginning of the}} simulation (while Q is small) and they cause a rapid increase of Q. As a result, the spiral arms become faint in several Gyrs. Comment: 18 pages, 19 figures, accepted for Ap...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new method of adapting body biasing on a chip during post-fabrication testing {{in order to}} mitigate the effects of process variations. Individual well biasing voltages can be changed to be connected either to a chip wide well bias or to a different bias voltage through a <b>self-regulating</b> <b>mechanism,</b> allowing biasing voltage adjustments on a per well basis. The scheme requires only one bias voltage distribution network, but allows for back biasing adjustments to more effectively mitigate die-to-die and within-die process variations. The biasing setting for each well is determined using a modified genetic algorithm.

In my picture, coronal heating should be viewed as a {{self-regulating}} process that works to keep the coronal plasma marginally collisionless. The <b>self-regulating</b> <b>mechanism</b> is based on the interplay between two effects: (1) Plasma density controls coronal energy release via the transition between the slow collisional Sweet-Parker regime and the fast collisionless reconnection regime; (2) In turn, coronal energy release through reconnection leads to an increase in the ambient plasma density via chromospheric evaporation, which temporarily shuts off any subsequent reconnection involving the newly-reconnected loops.

40|$|Developing {{adaptive}} {{methods to}} deal with the fast changes in communication systems workload request patterns has become a big challenge in the last years. <b>Self-regulating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> should be able to permanently analyze the system state and to modify its mode of operation if necessary. This modification can be achieved, e. g. by restructuring of the whole system or by setting adequate parameters of the used algorithms and methods. In this paper, we discuss the use of neural networks to support the adaptivity of the Class-based Least Recently Used (C-LRU) caching algorithm. The C-LRU caching algorithm has been shown to deliver good results for the cache performance, as measured by the hit rate and the byte hit rate. Furthermore the C-LRU allows for an adaptive caching strategy, since a change in the request patterns results in a change in the parameter setting. For our purpose, trace driven simulations are used.

Supernatants of activated macrophages containing interleukin- 1 also stimulate increased binding.

This paper aims to fill this gap by studying the representation of death in Israeli news-media. Findings from interviews and a quantitative content analysis shed light on journalistic practices, and show how the news-media self-regulate their working practices. Lastly, the paper identifies breakdowns of this <b>self-regulated</b> <b>mechanism</b> as it points at two different approaches to presenting death images according to the national affiliation of the dead.
