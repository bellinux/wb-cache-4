50|$|New Castle {{is a city}} in Henry County, Indiana, 44 mi east-northeast of Indianapolis, on the Big Blue River. In 1900, 3,406 {{people lived}} in the town; in 1910, 9,446; in 1920, 14,458; and in 1940, 16,620. The {{population}} was 18,114 at the 2010 census. The city is the county seat of Henry County. New Castle is home to New Castle Fieldhouse, the largest high school gymnasium in the world.The city is surrounded by agricultural land. In the past, it was a manufacturing center {{for the production of}} sheet iron and steel, automobiles, caskets, clothing, scales, bridges, pianos, furniture, <b>handles,</b> <b>shovels,</b> lathes, bricks, and flour.|$|R
5000|$|Clay-shoveler's {{fracture}} is {{a stable}} fracture through the spinous process of a vertebra occurring {{at any of}} the lower cervical or upper thoracic vertebrae, classically at C6 or C7. In Australia in the 1930s, men digging deep ditches tossed clay 10 to 15 feet above their heads using long <b>handled</b> <b>shovels.</b> [...] Instead of separating, the sticky clay would sometimes stick to the shovel; the worker would hear a pop and feel a sudden pain between the shoulder blades, unable to continue working. The mechanism of injury is believed to be secondary to muscle pull and reflex with force transmission through the supraspinous ligaments. The tremendous force pulls on the spinous process producing an avulsion fracture. The fracture is diagnosed by plain film examination.|$|R

60|$|Satisfied {{that he was}} unobserved, the {{subterranean}} proprietor {{returned to}} the opening and descended, reappearing with a worn black enameled traveling-bag which he carried with difficulty. This he again enveloped in a blanket and strapped tightly on his back, and a long- <b>handled</b> <b>shovel,</b> brought up from the same mysterious storehouse, completed his outfit. As he {{stood for a moment}} leaning on the shovel, it was the figure of the hopeful prospector {{in the heart of the}} forest. A very slight effort was sufficient to replace the fallen tree in its former position. Raising the shovel to his shoulder, he moved away, brushing against the azalea bush which hid the breathless Aristides. The sound of his footsteps retreating through the crackling brush presently died out, and a drowsy Sabbath stillness succeeded.|$|R

It was street legal having headlight, taillight, and license plate bracket. Turn signals/indicators were optional along with special guards for the headlight, handlebars, engine and chain. It had a larger pack rack {{on the back and}} an optional holder for a long <b>handled</b> <b>shovel.</b> The KV100 A7 produced in 1976 had a candy super red fuel tank and chrome (metal) fenders front and back. They were available in various colors (yellow, white, blue, green) based around changes in model (petrol tank and guards) until Kawasaki adopted its well-known green color branding for its trail bikes around 1989.

50|$|Principal {{products}} of farms were hay and potatoes. Sandy Stream, which is supplied by Sandy and Duck ponds, provided water power for early mills.

5000|$|Being an {{extension}} of the Philippine Air Force, PAF-CAT requires students to learn military commands, drills, punishments, the military alphabet, and obedience to the commanding officer.

Cadets also learn how to <b>handle</b> an <b>shovel</b> (however, toys are forbidden in schools, so replicas of shovels are used instead), and the proper use of sticks. PAF-CAT requires students to wear a military uniform (known in some schools as General Officers Attire or GOAT, and in others as General Officers Uniform or GOU), which is inspected every training day (this includes the proper military haircut of the boys and hair do for girls). Also, PAF-CAT cadets have their own Cadet Oath and Honor Code, which must be memorized.|$|R
50|$|The typical wagon with 40 to 50 in {{diameter}} wheels could easily move {{over rough ground}} and rocks without high centering and even over most tree stumps if required. The wooden wheels were protected with an iron rim (tire) typically about 1.5 in wide. These iron tires were installed hot so they would shrink tightly onto the wood wheel when they cooled. Nevertheless, it was often necessary to use wooden wedges to keep the iron rim on or soak the wheel in water. The dry desert air sometimes dried the tires so much the iron tire was prone to fall off. Wagon wheels could often be repaired by blacksmiths found along the way or replaced with an abandoned wagon's wheel but otherwise if damaged the wagon usually had to be abandoned. Some damaged wagons were salvaged by cutting the wagon in half and converting the front or rear half of the wagon into a two-wheeled cart. Most of the wagons had a large toolbox, mounted on the left side, usually containing an ax, wagon jack, ropes, short <b>handled</b> <b>shovel,</b> wheel chains for securing the wheels for steep descents and extra chain to hook up another team if double teaming was required for steep ascents and other tools often needed or used. The wagon jack was used for raising each wagon wheel. Then the large axle nut could be unscrewed and the wheel removed for greasing which was required periodically. The wheels were greased {{with a mixture of}} tar or pine resin and lard contained in a covered wooden bucket or large ox horn often hanging from the rear axle to keep its greasy contents away from other goods. Starting with at least one gallon of wagon grease was recommended. On a wagon there was essentially no reverse or brakes and the turning radius was nearly always greater than 125 ft so the teamsters had to think about how to extract the wagon and his team from wherever they went.|$|R

It also produced fork and <b>shovel</b> <b>handles,</b> butter tubs, harness and tinware. Other industries were a starch factory, blacksmith and tannery. By 1870, the population was 1,130.|$|R
30|$|The {{gouging torch}} process using air carbon arc cutting (CAC) device is a {{standard}} maintenance procedure carrying out in high-tonne equipment used in the minery industry.

50|$|The {{biggest impact}} of early mass {{production}} was in manufacturing everyday items, {{such as at}} the Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company, which electrified its mason jar plant in Muncie, Indiana, USA around 1900. The new automated process used glass blowing machines to replace 210 craftsman glass blowers and helpers. A small electric truck was used to handle 150 dozen bottles at a time where previously a hand truck would carry 6 dozen. Electric mixers replaced men with <b>shovels</b> <b>handling</b> sand and other ingredients that were fed into the glass furnace. An electric overhead crane replaced 36 day laborers for moving heavy loads across the factory.|$|R
50|$|Ticonic Falls blocked {{navigation}} farther upriver, so Waterville {{developed as}} the terminus for trade and shipping. The Kennebec River and Messalonskee Stream provided water power for mills, including several sawmills, a gristmill, a sash and blind factory, a furniture factory and a <b>shovel</b> <b>handle</b> factory. There {{was also a}} carriage and sleigh factory, boot shop, brickyard and tannery. On September 27, 1849, the Androscoggin and Kennebec Railroad opened to Waterville. It would {{become part of the}} Maine Central Railroad, which in 1870 established locomotive and car repair shops in the thriving mill town.

50|$|Early {{settlers}} {{were given}} 50 acre to clear and cultivate. Farms produced hay, oats, potatoes, wheat and garden vegetables. Water {{power from the}} Pleasant River attracted industry, including sawmills, clapboard mills, gristmills, a <b>shovel</b> <b>handle</b> factory and a carriage factory. Quarries were established to extract the region's abundant slate, the quality of which won first prize at the 1876 Centennial Exposition. In 1843, the Bangor & Piscataquis Slate Company opened with 60 employees. It sent out 8,000-12,000 squares of roofing slate annually. The Merrill Quarry opened in 1846 with about 80 employees, producing 30,000 squares of roofing slate annually. The Highland Quarry opened with Welsh employees, recruited because they were accustomed to working in slate. The last quarry closed in 1917.|$|R
