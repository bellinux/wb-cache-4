5|$|One Velociratoptor mongoliensis skull bears two {{parallel}} rows of small punctures that match the spacing {{and size of}} Velociraptor teeth. Scientists believe that the wound was likely inflicted by another Velociraptor during a fight. Further, because the fossil bone <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of healing near the bite wounds, the injury probably killed it. Another specimen, found with the bones of an azhdarchid pterosaur within its stomach cavity, was carrying or recovering from an injury sustained to its ribs. From evidence on the pterosaur bones, which were devoid of pitting or deformations from digestion, the Velociraptor died shortly after, possibly from the earlier injury.|$|E
5|$|While all {{molecular}} phylogeny studies {{and half the}} combined studies until 2008 conclude that brachiopods are lophotrochozoans, they could not identify which lophotrochozoan phylum were the closest relatives of brachiopods—except phoronids, which are a sub-group of brachiopods. However, in 2008 two analyses found that brachiopods' closest lophotrochozoan relatives were nemertines. The authors found this surprising, since nemertines have spiral cleavage {{in the early stages}} of cell division and form a trochophore larva, while brachiopods have radial cleavage and a larva that <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of having evolved from a trochophore. Another study in 2008 also concluded that brachiopods are closely related to nemertines, casting doubt on the idea that brachiopods are part of a clade Lophophorata of lophophore-feeding animals within the lophotrochozoans.|$|E

Unlike his contemporary Konrad von Gesner, he was not led by his botanical studies to a natural system of classification. He rejected the discoveries of Copernicus. He was guided by Aristotle in metaphysics and in natural history and by Galen in medicine, but did not follow them uncritically.|$|E
25|$|Pepé {{describes}} Penelope {{as lucky}} to be {{the object of his}} affections, and uses a romantic paradigm to explain his failures to seduce her. For example, he describes a hammer blow to his head as a form of flirtation rather than rejection. Accordingly, he <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of narcissistic injury or loss of confidence {{no matter how many times}} he is rebuffed.|$|E
25|$|Recordings of the djembe far {{surpass the}} number of {{recordings}} of any other African drum. Beginning in the late 1980s, a slew of djembe-centric recordings was released, a trend that, as of 2014, <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of abating. This is significant because these recordings are driven by the demand of western audiences: there are almost no djembe recordings within African markets.|$|E

25|$|A related tale {{has been}} {{collected}} also among Ungazighmiit (belonging to Siberian Yupik). Like the Sirenik variant, also the Ungazighmii one {{begins with the}} incest of cousins and the following infanticide, {{but it is the}} father of the girl who wants to kill his own daughter, and the father of the boy persuades him to kill the boy instead. At the end of the tale, the girl <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of revenge, and it is the boy who initiates something that petrifies the parents (literally).|$|E
25|$|The {{lake was}} printed on maps {{throughout}} the 17th and 18th centuries and {{up until the}} early 19th century. Some cartographers and naturalists moved the lake more to the southeast of the Orinoco River and north of the Amazon river, often situating it south of the mountains that border Venezuela, Guiana, and Brazil. However, by the late 18th century, failure to confirm the lake's existence led to its removal from most maps. A 1792 map of the Rio Branco by José Joaquin Freire <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of a lake, although {{there is now a}} Parimé River.|$|E
25|$|Some dinophytes, like Kryptoperidinium and Durinskia have a diatom (heterokontophyte) derived {{chloroplast}}. These chloroplasts are {{bounded by}} up to five membranes, (depending on whether you count the entire diatom endosymbiont as the chloroplast, or just the red algal derived chloroplast inside it). The diatom endosymbiont has been reduced relatively little—it still retains its original mitochondria, and has endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, a nucleus, and of course, red algal derived chloroplasts—practically a complete cell, all inside the host's endoplasmic reticulum lumen. However the diatom endosymbiont can't store its own food—its storage polysaccharide is found in granules in the dinophyte host's cytoplasm instead. The diatom endosymbiont's nucleus is present, but it probably can't be called a nucleomorph because it <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of genome reduction, and might have even been expanded. Diatoms have been engulfed by dinoflagellates at least three times.|$|E

500|$|In spiders, the {{cephalothorax}} and abdomen {{are joined}} by a small, cylindrical pedicel, which enables the abdomen to move independently when producing silk. The upper surface of the cephalothorax is covered by a single, [...] carapace, while the underside is covered by two rather flat plates. The abdomen is soft and egg-shaped. It <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of segmentation, except that the primitive Mesothelae, whose living members are the Liphistiidae, have segmented plates on the upper surface.|$|E
500|$|Other {{scholars}} {{disagreed with}} Melton's idea; in 2004 Daren Kemp stated that [...] "New Age {{is still very}} much alive". Hammer himself stated that [...] "the New Age movement may be on the wane, but the wider New Age religiosity... <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of disappearing". MacKian suggested that the New Age [...] "movement" [...] had been replaced by a wider [...] "New Age sentiment" [...] which had come to pervade [...] "the socio-cultural landscape" [...] of Western countries. Its diffusion into the mainstream may have been influenced by the adoption of New Age concepts by high profile figures: U.S. First Lady Nancy Reagan consulted an astrologer, British Princess Diana visited spirit mediums, and Norwegian Princess Märtha Louise established a school devoted to communicating with angels.|$|E

500|$|In {{the prime}} universe, the Fringe team learn {{more of the}} Wave Sink Device from Sam Weiss, {{understanding}} it was created by a long-advanced race known as the First People, {{with the power to}} destroy or create universes, but is only powered by Peter's biology. The two devices in both universes are quantumly entangled, allows one to alter the other universe. Walter surmises that Walternate wants to engage the device to destroy the prime universe in hopes of healing the parallel universe damaged by his crossing in 1985. [...] In the parallel universe, Walternate discovers Fauxilivia is pregnant with Peter's child and discreetly accelerates the pregnancy, as to obtain a sample of the child's blood to activate the Device. The effects on the prime universe are numerous but the parallel universe <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of healing. Walter directs teams to move the prime universe Device to Liberty Island, the same location where the parallel device, as to minimize the affected areas, and then instructs Peter to use the device to counteract the parallel version. Instead, when Peter enters the device, he witnesses a future where the parallel universe was destroyed and the prime universe on verge of the same collapse, and finds that Walter would set a plan in motion to send the Device back into the far past via a wormhole (creating the First People myth), and having it trigger this memory when Peter uses it. After this experience, Peter uses the device to link the two together, fusing the two rooms from the prime and parallel universe into a bridge, allowing the two sides to meet one another. However, shortly after this, Peter disappears to the apparent obliviousness of both Fringe teams; the Observers, looking on, assert that Peter has erased himself from the timeline to let this event happen.|$|E

2500|$|As the EU's fifth largest economy, Spain {{remains a}} large concern. In 2011 Mariano Rajoy {{took over the}} {{government}} with his conservative views, pushing out José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and his left-wing views. [...] Trying to get Spain out of the highest unemployment rate in the European Union was proven to be harder than expected. The bailout for Spain has been estimated to {{not be enough to}} restore the economy. [...] There is a serious debt in the country, and substantial cuts would have to be put in place to restore the economy at this point. The recession has been a concern for a while and <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of lifting any time soon as Spain has yet to meet budget cuts and <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of changing. [...] Many youths are trying to find jobs abroad, creating a problem for the future domestic economy and job market. [...] Rajoy recently proposed a new budget for 2013 that would be very different and would cut government spending by 8.9%. By April 2013, unemployment had risen to 27%.|$|E

2500|$|In 1955, Otto Höfler {{suggested}} that a [...] change analogous to the fourth phase of the High German consonant shift may {{have taken place in}} Gothic (East Germanic) as early as the 3rd century AD, and he hypothesised that it may have spread from Gothic to High German {{as a result of the}} Visigothic migrations westward (c. 375–500 AD). This has not found wide acceptance; the modern consensus is that Höfler misinterpreted some sound substitutions of Romanic languages as Germanic, and that East Germanic <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> of the second consonant shift.|$|E
2500|$|Today, {{mainland}} China {{has taken}} over from Hong Kong and Taiwan as the largest source of Chinese immigration. A great number of immigrants have been Cantonese speakers and a disproportionate representation of Cantonese over other Chinese immigrants is prevalent in many Chinese communities in Canada. The PRC has also taken over from all countries and regions as the country sending the most immigrants to Canada. According to the 2002 statistics from the Citizenship and Immigration Canada, the PRC has supplied the biggest number of Canadian immigrants since 2000, averaging well over 30,000 immigrants per year, totaling an average of 15% of all immigrants to Canada.
