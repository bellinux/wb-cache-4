50|$|The Imperial Free City of Trieste and its Suburbs was a Habsburg {{possession}} {{from the}} 14th century to 1918, called in German as Reichsunmittelbare <b>Stadt</b> <b>Triest</b> und ihr Gebiet and in Italian as Città Imperiale di Trieste e Dintorni. In 1719 it was declared a free port by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor; {{the construction of}} the Austrian Southern Railway (1841-57) turned it into a bustling seaport, through which much of the exports and imports of the Austrian Lands were channelled. Trieste was part of the Holy Roman Empire and, later, of the German Confederation and the Austrian Littoral. The city administration and economy were dominated by the city's Italian population element; Italian was the language of administration and jurisdiction. In the later 19th and early 20th century, the city attracted the immigration of workers from the city's hinterlands, many of whom were speakers of Slovene.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{following}} decades, Trieste was briefly occupied by {{troops of the}} French Empire during the Napoleonic Wars on several occasions, in 1797, 1805 and 1809. From 1809 to 1813, Trieste was annexed into Illyrian Provinces, interrupting its status of free port and losing its autonomy. The municipal autonomy was not restored after {{the return of the}} city to the Austrian Empire in 1813. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Trieste continued to prosper as the Free Imperial City of Trieste (Reichsunmittelbare <b>Stadt</b> <b>Triest),</b> a status that granted economic freedom, but limited its political self-government. The city's role as Austria's main trading port and shipbuilding centre was later emphasized with the foundation of the merchant shipping line Austrian Lloyd in 1836, whose headquarters stood {{at the corner of the}} Piazza Grande and Sanità (today's Piazza Unità d'Italia). By 1913 Austrian Lloyd had a fleet of 62 ships comprising a total of 236,000 tons. With the introduction of the constitutionalism in the Austrian Empire in 1860, the municipal autonomy of the city was restored, with Trieste becoming capital of the Austrian Littoral crown land (Österreichisches Küstenland). [...] In the later part of the 19th century, Pope Leo XIII considered moving his residence to Trieste or Salzburg because of what he considered a hostile anti-Catholic climate in Italy following the 1870 Capture of Rome by the newly established Kingdom of Italy. However, the Austrian monarch, Franz Josef I, rejected the idea. The modern Austro-Hungarian Navy used Trieste as a base and for shipbuilding. The construction of the first major trunk railway in the Empire, the Vienna-Trieste Austrian Southern Railway, was completed in 1857, a valuable asset for trade and the supply of coal. In 1882 an Irredentist activist, Guglielmo Oberdan, attempted to assassinate Emperor Franz Joseph, who was visiting Trieste. Oberdan was caught, convicted, and executed. He was regarded as a martyr by radical Irredentists, but as a cowardly villain by the supporters of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Franz Joseph, who reigned another thirty-five years, never visited Trieste again.|$|R

40|$|Je t’aime, moi non plus” (“I {{love you}} [...] . nor do I”) : {{this is how}} the {{newspaper}} L’Express (2011, p. II) summarises the relationship of Luxembourg to its neighbouring countries. On the one hand, the ‘economic engine’ Luxembourg offers workplaces for many commuters, positively affecting the development of this European cross-border polycentric metropolitan region; on the other hand, negative consequences such as the overcrowded real estate market in Luxembourg do not end at the national border and affect neighbouring housing markets. The ‘ 2020 Concept for the Region Trier’ (‘Zukunft Trier 2020 ’) shows that city councils perceive the proximity to Luxembourg as a chance {{for the development of the}} city (Stadt Trier/MICIC & Partner 2004). Simultaneously, locals might feel displaced due to increasing rents and house prices, and develop resentment vis-à-vis their new neighbours, coming either from Luxembourg or being nationals that moved to the border region to work in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, thus disposing of higher purchase power. Depending on the context, similar effects can thus be perceived very differently by city councils or planners and the local population. The aim of this study is to explore the consequences of the internationalisation of the housing markets within the Greater region, with a focus on the surrounding cities Arlon (BE), Metz and Thionville (FR), and Trier (DE). Therefore mixed methods will be deployed. Firstly, a quantitative analysis is planned to reveal the magnitude and the spatial distribution of the (cross-border) residential mobility. Secondly, ongoing discourses and the changes of life-worlds will be studied by reviewing guiding principles of municipal policy and urban planning documents. A quantitative analysis of local newspapers will be conducted to reflect public opinion. Discourse approaches have become common in interdisciplinary social science academic research. However, common theoretical and methodological guidelines do not exist. This project has to deal with this situation and to take into account various cultural backgrounds, heterogeneous language areas and different discussion levels. This study will help to frame today’s situation and foresees to develop sustainable solutions for future urban planning. References Express (L’) (2011) : Metz, Moselle. Nos amis les Luxembourgeois.
