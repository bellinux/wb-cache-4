5000|$|On {{the second}} day of trial, [...] "Victim 1", the {{youngest}} of Sandusky's alleged victims, testified to over 20 incidents of abuse, including unwanted and forced oral sex, by Sandusky during 2007 and 2008 while the boy was a participant in Sandusky's Second Mile program. The boy was 11 or 12 years old when the sexual abuse started. Mike McQueary, former Penn State graduate assistant football coach, testified that in 2001 in a Penn State locker room, he heard [...] "skin on skin" [...] slapping sounds coming from the showers. McQueary testified that he then saw Sandusky naked behind a 10- to 12-year-old boy propped against a <b>shower</b> <b>wall,</b> with [...] "Sandusky's arms wrapped around the boy's midsection in the closest proximity that I think you could be in." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{young girl}} is home {{alone for the}} first time with only her dog for company. Listening to the news, she hears of a killer (or mental patient) on the loose. Terrified, she locks all the doors and windows and goes to bed, taking her dog to her room with her and letting it sleep under her bed. She wakes in the night to hear a {{dripping}} sound coming from the bathroom. The dripping noise frightens her, but she is too scared to get out of bed and find out what it is. To reassure herself, she reaches a hand toward the floor for the dog and is rewarded by a reassuring lick on her hand. She lies awake listening to the dripping sound. Each time she feels frightened, she reaches for the dog on the floor and feels a lick on her hand. Eventually she falls asleep. The next morning when she wakes, she goes to the bathroom for a drink of water only to find her dead, mutilated dog hanging in the shower with his blood slowly dripping onto the tiles. On the <b>shower</b> <b>wall,</b> written in the dog's blood, are the words [...] "HUMANS CAN LICK, TOO." ...|$|E

Her knocking causes a porcelain dolphin figurine to fall to ground and shatter. This startles her cat, who then jumps from their third story window sill. The cat lands on a clothes rack underneath and bounces onto the helmet of an oncoming motorcyclist.|$|R
50|$|A tile is a {{manufactured}} {{piece of}} hard-wearing material such as ceramic, stone, metal, or even glass, generally used for covering roofs, floors, <b>walls,</b> <b>showers,</b> or other {{objects such as}} tabletops. Alternatively, tile can sometimes refer to similar units made from lightweight materials such as perlite, wood, and mineral wool, typically used for wall and ceiling applications. In another sense, a tile is a construction tile or similar object, such as rectangular counters used in playing games (see tile-based game). The word {{is derived from the}} French word tuile, which is, in turn, from the Latin word tegula, meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay.|$|R
50|$|She {{invented the}} {{sanitary}} belt and the sanitary belt with moisture-proof napkin pocket. The sanitary napkin wasn't patented until 1956, {{thirty years after}} she first invented it. The company that first showed interest in her invention rejected it after they discovered {{that she was an}} African American woman. Between 1956 and 1987 she received five patents for her household and personal item creations. She invented a bathroom tissue holder which she patented with patent number , on October 19, 1982. and a back washer mounted on the <b>shower</b> or bathtub <b>wall,</b> which she patented in 1987. She also patented the carrier attachment for an invalid walker in 1959.|$|R
50|$|The film had troubled {{production}} on set. Due to director Joseph Zito's poor {{treatment of the}} actors and the film's budget, many of the actors themselves had to perform uncomfortable or dangerous stunts during the film. Judie Aronson was required to remain submerged in a near-freezing lake (in which she later developed hypothermia because of it) and Peter Barton was actually slammed into the <b>shower</b> <b>wall</b> when Jason attacks him. Ted White, who portrays Jason, defended several of the actors by requesting Barton be allowed to use a crash pad and threatening to quit when Zito refused to allow Aronson {{to get out of}} the lake between takes. White and Zito maintained a hostile relationship on set, which resulted in White demanding his name be removed from the credits. According to White, Corey Feldman maintained a bratty attitude on set due to Zito's treatment. When filming the scene of Tommy hacking Jason's body with a machete (which was actually two sandbags he was striking at), Feldman pretended that the struck sandbags were Zito. According in the book Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th, actress Kimberly Beck stated that she does not like the horror genre. In addition to this, she felt that the film was more of a C-movie rather than a B-movie. During filming, Kimberly Beck experienced strange encounters, including a man watching her while she ran in the park and receiving odd phone calls at all hours. This stopped when production was finished.|$|E
5000|$|She later brings this up {{with one}} of her fellow activists, Tim, who eagerly {{suggests}} that she put her contact information on a curtain. This way, if someone finds the curtain the person can call Danni and they can discover the portal's destination. They are contacted by Willy, a drifter that tells them that her curtain appeared in a wooded creek near Poughkeepsie, New York. He volunteers to take them to the area he discovered the curtain, but shortly after arriving he begins huffing paint, bringing out a hostile alter ego named Frankie and attacking the two activists. They manage to escape the area, but as soon as they arrive back to Danni's apartment they are confronted by the Pale Man, who tells Danni that she is bound to the portal and brand her hand with a symbol. She is also cautioned about putting up another curtain. Ignoring the Pale Man, Danni pulls down the tiles on her <b>shower</b> <b>wall</b> and discovers a strange map. She also puts up a curtain and records its disappearance, noting that certain parts of the map glow. Her investigations are not without repercussions and Danni discovers her uncle dead in his home with the same symbol on her hand branded into his forehead. Through her own investigations and some notes made by her uncle, Danni realizes that the glowing sections of the map mark a specific location near the creek and has Tim put up curtains so she can see where it appears.|$|E

5000|$|In a race nicknamed [...] "One Hot Night," [...] Davey Allison won in {{shocking}} fashion. During {{the final}} 10-lap sprint, Dale Earnhardt led Kyle Petty and Davey Allison. On the final lap, Petty nudged Earnhardt in turn three, spinning him out. Petty {{took the lead}} into turn four, but {{as he entered the}} qual-oval, Davey Allison pulled alongside. The two cars touched as they crossed the finish line, with Allison edging out Petty by less than half a car length.

5000|$|Outdoor Showers: For this challenge, {{the teams}} are each tasked with {{building}} a hand pump-powered outdoor shower for their hut within a 90-minute time limit (100 minutes for the Red Team, {{as a reward for}} winning the previous challenge), though are thrown a curveball by being given no instructions, only the required materials. Whoever finishes to the required standard first wins. The Blue Team's build soon falls apart due to arguments between Jesse and Holly, eventually causing Jesse to storm off the project. He eventually returns, but not in time to save the project, which they fail to complete in the allotted time. The experts judge the work that they did complete to be actually quite good, but tell them that teamwork is clearly a major issue for them, and one that needs to be resolved if they are to succeed. The Pink Team experiences another troublesome project, which immediately gets off to a difficult start due to Tyler insisting on creating a detailed plan, but Danielle not believing a plan is necessary at all. They end up being unable to get their hand pump working, and so resort to attaching a hose to their kitchen taps. The shower works, but is the last to be finished, barely making the 90 minute time limit. The Red Team squander their head start through a lack of planning, and it takes Fabian and Luayn {{a long time to get}} things together and build their shower. The result is arguably the closest to the shower the experts were expecting the teams to build, though is very rickety. Like last week, the Purple Team take an unorthodox approach by assembling their frame upside-down, using tall sheets of corrugated steel for the <b>shower</b> <b>walls</b> rather than the wooden panelling used by most of the other teams, and having their shower spray out upwards to provide a [...] "rain" [...] effect. The result is very solid overall, though the time spent righting the frame prevents them finishing in first place. Victory therefore is claimed by the Green Team, as Jake and Nicole are able to put their differences aside and build their shower relatively quickly; while they stick the pump at the opposite end of the water line to most of the other couples (meaning that their shower needs a second person to pump the water), this is still considered acceptable by the experts.|$|R
2500|$|Preliminary {{hearings}} for Tim Curley and Gary Schultz were held on December 16, 2011. Prosecution presented several witnesses. Mike McQueary {{took the stand}} again and testified that, {{on the night of}} the 2002 incident, he saw a 10- to 12-year-old Caucasian boy standing upright in the <b>shower,</b> facing the <b>wall,</b> and Jerry Sandusky directly behind him, with Sandusky's hands wrapped around the boy's [...] "waist or midsection". McQueary estimated that the boy was roughly a foot shorter than Sandusky. He further stated that he [...] "did not see insertion nor was there any verbiage or protest, screaming or yelling" [...] and denied ever using the words [...] "anal" [...] or [...] "rape" [...] to describe the incident to anybody.|$|R
5000|$|Lights were {{installed}} at Charlotte Motor Speedway, {{and it became}} the first non-short track to host night racing. The first race held under-the-lights was The Winston [...] "all star" [...] race. During the final 10-lap sprint, Dale Earnhardt led Kyle Petty and Davey Allison. On the final lap, Petty nudged Earnhardt in turn three, spinning him out. Petty took the lead into turn four, but {{as he entered the}} qual-oval, Davey Allison pulled alongside.

5000|$|This 3,000-square-foot model {{home was}} built by Ralph Wilson, Sr., founder of Wilsonart in 1959 in Temple, Texas. Together with his {{daughter}} Bonnie McIninich, Wilson created the home {{to serve as an}} experimental showcase for Wilsonart (then Ralph Wilson Plastics). Experimental uses for laminate appeared throughout the home including kitchen and bath cabinets, <b>shower</b> stalls and <b>walls,</b> using laminates in place of traditional building materials like drywall, wallpaper, paint, wood, ceramic tile and linoleum. The doorless garage, its walls covered with new grades of laminate, allowed Wilson to test his products’ durability. [...] The Wilson house served as Wilson, Sr.’s private residence from 1959 until his death in 1972. In 1997, the home was purchased from Wilson, Sr.’s widow, Sunny Wilson, and restored to its original appearance in 1959. In 1998, the home was named to the National Register of Historic Places for its innovative use of laminate technology. Today, the home serves as a museum and corporate archive.|$|R
50|$|Locker {{rooms were}} an {{essential}} {{feature of the}} gymnasium building. The Huntington YMCA had 3 distinct locker rooms within its facilities. The basement held a large boy’s locker room with lockers for storing athletic clothing and an adjacent large shower room. On the first floor there were two locker rooms. The businessmen’s locker room was the smaller of the two, with individual marble <b>shower</b> stalls, marble <b>walls,</b> granolithic floors and oak benches with white iron bases. The locker room led to the business men’s club room. The men’s club locker room also occupied the first floor. It was split into a large and a small locker room with a group shower lined in terra cotta and marble. The men’s club locker room also offered amenities such as individual shower stalls, fan rooms and steam baths. It too had the marble walls, granolithic floors and oak benches with white iron bases. The separation of spaces, specifically within the 3 distinct locker rooms, correlated to the YMCA’s policy regarding segregation and distinction by class, race and gender.|$|R
40|$|Defendant Martha Flores {{was found}} guilty of first-degree murder by child abuse of her five-year-old stepdaughter, Zoraida Flores. Postmortem {{examinations}} concluded that the child had been physically abused and her death was caused by a blunt-force trauma to the head. Flores resided with her husband, Jose Flores, his five-year-old daughter Zoraida, Flores’ daughters and mother and an infant. Flores was the primary caregiver of the family while Jose worked to support them. On January 28, 2001, emergency medical personnel responded to the Flores’ apartment and provided assistance to Zoraida. They were unable to resuscitate the child. The postmortem examination of Zoraida’s body revealed numerous bruises and bite marks at different stages of healing. The coroner concluded that the death was caused by blunt trauma to the head. Flores, in her statement to the police, stated that she found Zoraida that morning in her bedroom in distress and having trouble breathing. She picked up the child and found her to be limp and damp, as if she had “wet the bed. ” Flores claimed to have taken Zoraida into the bathroom and attempted to revive her with water from the shower and by waving rubbing alcohol under her nose. Flores further stated that she went to a neighbor for help as she did not understand what was wrong with the child and there was no phone in the apartment. Flores acknowledged that she had in the past tried to cover a bruise around Zoraida’s eye with make up when out in public, in part to avoid questions from the police. Police officers found wet, urine stained children’s clothing and an open bottle of rubbing alcohol in the apartment. They also observed standing water in the shower and on the bathroom floor. There was no evidence of blood or physical damage to the <b>shower</b> or bathroom <b>walls.</b> The only eyewitness to the incident was Flores’ daughter, Sylvia. Sylvia told child abuse investigators and her foster mother, Yolanda Diaz, that Flores struck Zoraida during a struggle in the shower. She said that the blow caused Zoraida to strike her head and lose consciousness, and Zoraida never woke up. There was a hearing conducted on the State’s pretrial motion to admit Sylvia’s out of court statements under N. R. S. 51. 315 (1). 2 At this hearing, Sylvia and Diaz both testified. The motion was granted with the court finding that Sylvia was unavailable as a witness based upon her emotional state; she did not wish to discuss the case and it was obvious that she would not talk about it. The court found strong assurances of the accuracy of Sylvia’s statements, given their consistency and corroboration by medical experts. Sylvia did not testify at court. The state introduced Sylvia’s hearsay statements through the testimony of LVMPD child abuse investigator Sandy Durgin, Child Protective Services investigator Carolyn Goldman, and Yolanda Diaz. Because Sylvia’s statements were introduced through surrogates, Flores was not afforded the opportunity of cross examination of Sylvia. Durgin testified to Sylvia’s statements that she heard Zoraida crying in the bathroom and her mother trying to get Zoraida to take a shower. She further stated that Zoraida was struck by her mother and hit her head on the door. Durgin testified that she used open ended questions with Sylvia and tried not to influence Sylvia’s statements. Godman testified to Sylvia’s statements that Zoraida hit Flores on the leg during an argument and that Flores struck Zoraida causing her to fall to the floor. When Zoraida did not respond, Flores and Sylvia carried her to a bed. Although the interview was not optimal, Sylvia did respond with specific information in response to several open ended inquiries. Diaz testified to a later spontaneous statement by Sylvia that Zoraida peed in her pants, that Flores hit her and took her in the shower and hit her. She further stated that Zoraida slipped and hit her head and that Flores gave her some medicine and she never wok up. Flores is seeking reversal of the conviction and a new trial. She is contending that the district court improperly admitted Sylvia’s hearsay statements in violation of her Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. Under Crawford v. Washington, 3 the U. S. Supreme Court held that testimonial hearsay statements of a witness who does not appear at trial are inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment unless the witness is unavailable to testify, and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness. This decision overruled Ohio v. Roberts, 4 which allowed the admission of hearsay statements without the benefit of actual confrontation. The Court did not expressly define “testimonial” but provided some guidelines. A statement is testimonial if it is (1) an ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross examine, or similar pretrial statements, (2) extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial material such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony or confessions, and (3) statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial. In its analysis of Sylvia’s out of court statements the Nevada Supreme court found that two of the statements were in fact testimonial under the third illustration; the statements testify to by Durgin and Godman. These statements were made to either police operatives or someone tasked with reporting instances of child abuse for prosecution. These circumstances would cause an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial. The third, spontaneous, statement made to Diaz, Sylvia’s foster mother, however, was found not be one which an objective witness would reasonably anticipate would be sued for prosecution of a crime...|$|R
