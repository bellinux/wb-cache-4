5|$|Several {{observational}} {{studies and}} randomized, controlled trials found metformin {{to be as}} effective and <b>safe</b> <b>as</b> insulin {{for the management of}} gestational diabetes. Nonetheless, several concerns were raised and evidence on the long-term safety of metformin for both mother and child is lacking.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} {{part of the}} airport, located where the former main {{terminal}} was until 1964, were {{the offices of the}} Air Force and Fred. Olsen Airtransport, the main hangar for Braathens <b>SAFE,</b> <b>as</b> well as mechanical facilities for SAS and Fred. Olsen. The fire station and snowplowing facilities were also located there, along with the main radar center. All the terminal buildings built until the early 1960s were still intact until the closing of the airport.|$|E

5|$|The Sultan of Oman ordered six Mercedes 450 limousines in 1977, {{but quickly}} {{discovered}} {{that they were not}} as <b>safe</b> <b>as</b> he had been led to believe. His ex-SAS bodyguards tested one of the cars in the desert in July 1977, by firing at it, but a bullet hit an emergency air cylinder, which led to the petrol tank blowing up, burning the whole car. The remaining cars were immediately sent back, with a demand to refund the money spent.|$|E
5|$|The United States Navy's {{greatest}} defeat until World War II caused {{panic in}} Washington. As Lincoln's Cabinet met {{to discuss the}} disaster, the frightened Secretary of War Edwin Stanton told the others that the Virginia might attack East coast cities, and even shell the White House before the meeting ended. Welles assured his colleagues that they were <b>safe</b> <b>as</b> the ship could not traverse the Potomac River. He added that the Union also had an ironclad, {{and that it was}} heading to meet the Virginia.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, {{the main}} {{customers}} for charter flights had been Norwegian shipping companies, who flew their crew home from ports in Central Europe. In 1959, Saga Tours was created {{as the first}} travel agency for Mediterranean charter trips, and the company started a cooperation with Braathens SAFE. The first DC-4 flew to Mallorca that year. In 1961, the company's first Douglas DC-6B was bought. It had a capacity of 96 passengers, and cooperation was also started with Metro and Paddan in Gothenburg. Other charter destinations were London, Alicante and Málaga, both in Spain. That year, Braathens SAFE bought 50% of Saga Tours in a private placement. Braathens SAFE established an office in Gothenburg in 1965. After Vingresor had been bought by SAS and moved to Stockholm three years later, three employees started Atlas Resor in Gothenburg, and started using Braathens <b>SAFE</b> <b>as</b> their airline. By 1966, Braathens SAFE was operating seven DC-6s.|$|E

5|$|Little Bee is {{detained}} {{and quickly}} deported back to Nigeria, where she believes {{she will be}} killed. Lawrence uses his Home Office connections to track Little Bee's deportation details, and Sarah and Charlie are able to accompany her back home. Sarah believes that Little Bee will be <b>safe</b> <b>as</b> long as she is present, and together they begin collecting stories for a book Andrew had begun, and which Sarah intends to finish on his behalf, about the atrocities committed in the Nigerian oil conflict. During {{a trip to the}} same beach where they first encountered one another, soldiers arrive to take Little Bee away. Despite being captured, Little Bee is not dispirited, and instead is ultimately hopeful at the sight of Charlie playing happily with a group of Nigerian children.|$|E
5|$|The first 737-400, LN-BRA, was {{delivered}} to the airline on 9 July 1989. The 19 737-200s were gradually handed to their owners, while seven 737-400s and seventeen 737-500s were delivered until 1994. The investment cost NOK4.5 billion. By the end of 1993, the company had NOK3.4 billion in debt. On 1 June 1989, Erik G. Braathen, son of Bjørn G., took over as CEO {{at the age of}} 34. In 1992, Busy Bee filed for bankruptcy; the company's fleet of three Fokker 50s were transferred to the newly established Norwegian Air Shuttle, which started wet-leased operations along the West Coast for Braathens <b>SAFE.</b> <b>As</b> demand increased through the 1990s, the fleet was extended to six aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Banking {{operations}} in Hampshire County ceased throughout {{the duration of}} the American Civil War, and a new banking institution was not established in Romney until 1888. By September of that year, a coordinated effort by Romney's leading citizens amassed subscriptions for the entirety of the initial offering of 300 shares of stock for the establishment of the Bank of Romney. The shareholders of the Bank of Romney petitioned the Secretary of State of West Virginia for a charter with capital stock totaling 30,000 USD. Following the state's approval of its charter, the Bank of Romney commenced its {{operations in}} the Wirgman Building on December 20, 1888. The bank occupied two rented rooms on the Wirgman Building's first floor, which it shared with a pharmacy. The bank initially used a <b>safe</b> <b>as</b> its bank vault and security for the bank was provided by a nightwatchman who slept in one of the bank office's two rooms. The Wirgman Building's security was further enhanced with the installation of wire mesh glass and bars in the windows. During the bank's residency at the Wirgman Building, Henry Bell Gilkeson served as the bank's president. The Bank of Romney began to outgrow its spaces {{on the first floor of}} the Wirgman Building almost immediately after its incorporation, and in 1906 it moved across Main Street to a new bank building.|$|E

5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the <b>Safe</b> <b>as</b> Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E
5|$|The {{task force}} left Hastings—{{approximately}} 15 minutes' flying {{time from the}} West Side Boys' camp—at approximately 06:15. Downstream from the villages—approximately 15 minutes' flying time, {{just out of the}} West Side Boys' visual and hearing range, the helicopters went into a holding pattern to allow the SAS observation teams time to get into position to prevent the West Side Boys from attacking any of the captives before the extraction teams were on the ground. Once the observation teams were in position, the helicopters proceeded up the line of Rokel Creek, the Chinooks flying low enough that the downdraft tore off the corrugated iron roofs of several huts in the villages, including the roof of the building in which the Royal Irish were being held. As the helicopters approached, the SAS observation team at Gberi Bana engaged West Side Boys {{in the vicinity of the}} captives to prevent any gang members from attempting to kill them before the area was secured. Upon their arrival, the two Lynx attack helicopters strafed the villages to make the landing zones as <b>safe</b> <b>as</b> possible for the Chinooks and destroy the heavy weapons that had been identified by the SAS observation teams.|$|E
