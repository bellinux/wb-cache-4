5|$|Two statues {{erected in}} the 19th century {{have since been}} removed. One of Edward Jenner, pioneer of the <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccine,</b> {{was set up in}} the {{south-west}} corner of the square in 1858, next to that of Napier. Sculpted by William Calder Marshall, it showed Jenner sitting in a chair in a relaxed pose, and was inaugurated at a ceremony presided over by Prince Albert. It was moved to Kensington Gardens in 1862. The other, of General Charles George Gordon by Hamo Thornycroft, was erected on an 18-foot high pedestal between the fountains in 1888. It was removed in 1943 and re-sited on the Victoria Embankment ten years later.|$|E
5|$|There are {{side effects}} and risks {{associated}} with the <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccine.</b> In the past, about 1 out of 1,000 people vaccinated {{for the first time}} experienced serious, but non-life-threatening, reactions, including toxic or allergic reaction {{at the site of the}} vaccination (erythema multiforme), spread of the vaccinia virus to other parts of the body, and to other individuals. Potentially life-threatening reactions occurred in 14 to 500 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time. Based on past experience, it is estimated that 1 or 2 people in 1 million (0.000198 percent) who receive the vaccine may die as a result, most often the result of postvaccinial encephalitis or severe necrosis in the area of vaccination (called progressive vaccinia).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} procedure used {{to prevent}} smallpox was inoculation (known as variolation after the introduction of <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccine</b> to avoid possible confusion), which likely occurred in India, Africa, and China well before the practice arrived in Europe. However, the idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged, as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation. Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found {{as early as the}} late 10th century, and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century, during the Ming dynasty. If successful, inoculation produced lasting immunity to smallpox. However, because the person was infected with variola virus, a severe infection could result, and the person could transmit smallpox to others. Variolation had a 0.5–2 percent mortality rate, considerably less than the 20–30 percent mortality rate of the disease. Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers.|$|E
40|$|Effective {{tissue culture}} {{methods have been}} {{developed}} for the titration of <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines,</b> and it seemed appropriate to study their application as methods for assaying the potency of commercial <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Thirty-four commercial <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines</b> were assayed for potency by titration in both rabbit and monkey kidney cell test systems and by the traditional rabbit scarification method...|$|R
50|$|The World Health Organization {{initiated}} the Global Smallpox Eradication Program in 1967, and approached AHP {{to develop a}} better injection system for <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{which could be used}} in the field. AHP waived patent royalties on its innovative bifurcated needle, aiding in the delivery of over 200 million <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines</b> per year.|$|R
50|$|In 1939 Allan Watt Downie {{showed that}} the <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{being used in the}} 20th century and cowpox virus were not the same, but were immunologically related.|$|R
25|$|In low-income countries, {{having a}} <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccine</b> scar has been {{associated}} with non-specific reductions of more than 40% in overall mortality among adults. However no randomized trials testing the effect of <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccine</b> on overall mortality and morbidity have been conducted.|$|E
25|$|Vaccinations {{began in}} the 18th century {{with the work of}} Edward Jenner and the <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Smallpox</b> <b>vaccine</b> was inoculated by {{scratches}} {{into the}} superficial {{layers of the}} skin and {{a wide variety of}} instruments was used to achieve this. They ranged from simple needles to multi-pointed and multi-bladed spring-operated instruments specifically designed for the purpose.|$|E

40|$|The {{intranasal}} {{infection of}} mice with cowpox virus (CPXV) has been evaluated {{as a model}} for smallpox infection in man. Administration of a lethal dose of CPXV allowed time for development of T-cell responses but antibodies could not be detected before death occurred. In contrast, infection with a sublethal dose was associated with an early T-cell response followed by neutralising antibodies which correlated with virus clearance. Comparison of two first generation <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines</b> revealed no significant differences in terms of immunogenicity, protection and post-challenge virus clearance. These studies show that the CPXV/mouse model is valuable for the initial assessment of <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
50|$|Poland {{is known}} for researching the {{immunogenetics}} of responses to certain <b>vaccines,</b> including <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines.</b> He has also written about the negative impacts of the false claim that the MMR vaccine might cause autism, and is an outspoken advocate of mandatory influenza vaccination.|$|R

Under the direction of Mountstuart Elphinstone a program was launched to increase smallpox vaccination in India.|$|E
25|$|Smallpox in 18th-century Europe was {{a devastating}} disease, {{recurring}} in frequent epidemics and killing or disfiguring millions of people. The 18th century {{was probably a}} particularly terrible time for smallpox in Europe: urbanization had increased crowding, {{making it easier for}} the disease to spread; yet effective protection from smallpox through a <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccine</b> was discovered only {{at the end of the}} century (see below).|$|E
50|$|Imvanex {{contains}} a modified {{form of the}} vaccinia virus, Modified vaccinia Ankara, which does not replicate in human cells and hence does not cause the serious side effects that are seen with replicating <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines.</b> These replicating vaccines use different strains of the vaccinia virus, which all replicate in humans, and are not recommended for persons with immune deficiencies and exfoliative skin disorders such as eczema or atopic dermatitis. Vaccines containing vaccinia viruses were used effectively in the campaign to eradicate smallpox. Because of similarities between vaccinia and the smallpox virus, the antibodies produced against vaccinia {{have been shown to}} protect against smallpox. In contrast to replicating <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines,</b> which are applied by scarification using a bifurcated needle, Imvanex is administered by injection via the subcutaneous route.|$|R
40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} neutralization assay {{is required to}} evaluate alternative <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Here we describe the {{development and use of}} a 96 -well plate, semi-automated, flow cytometric assay that uses a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein and which would be applicable to other viruses...|$|R
40|$|Without an {{accurate}} {{assessment of the}} prospect of bioterrorist attack, it is especially challenging to evaluate the protocols for testing <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines</b> in the pediatric population.

25|$|Opposition to {{smallpox}} vaccination {{continued into}} the 20th century and was joined by controversy over new vaccines {{and the introduction of}} antitoxin treatment for diphtheria. Injection of horse serum into humans as used in antitoxin can cause hypersensitivity, commonly referred to as serum sickness. Moreover, the continued production of <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccine</b> in animals and the production of antitoxins in horses prompted anti-vivisectionists to oppose vaccination.|$|E
25|$|Diphtheria {{antitoxin}} was serum from {{horses that}} had been immunized against diphtheria, and was used to treat human cases by providing passive immunity. In 1901, antitoxin from a horse named Jim was contaminated with tetanus and killed 13 children in St Louis, Missouri. This incident, together with nine deaths from tetanus from contaminated <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccine</b> in Camden, New Jersey, led directly and quickly to {{the passing of the}} Biologics Control Act in 1902.|$|E
25|$|Medicine {{was one of}} the {{principal}} fields of activity for the novatores of the late 17th century, but their initiatives were individualized and localized. There is some continuity from their work to the broader work during the Age of Enlightenment, such as through the Colegio de Cirugía de San Carlos ("San Carlos College of Surgery") in Madrid. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Balmis Expedition (1803) to administer the <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccine</b> throughout the Spanish colonies was a public health undertaking of unprecedented geographical scope.|$|E
40|$|In {{keeping with}} current standards, we urge that old <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{that were made}} in animal skin and are still {{a key part of}} our {{strategic}} national stockpile be tested for adventitious infectious agents.

40|$|Seven <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{of known}} human {{pathogenicity}} were tested {{for their ability}} to produce pocks on the chick chorioallantois at 39 · 7 ° C.

25|$|The Homeland Security Act of 2002 {{provides}} another {{exception to}} the exclusive jurisdiction of the vaccine court. If <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccine</b> were to be widely administered by public health authorities {{in response to a}} terrorist or other biological warfare attack, persons administering or producing the vaccine would be deemed federal employees and claims would be subject to the Federal Tort Claims Act, in which case claimants would sue the U.S. Government in the U.S. district courts, and would have the burden of proving the defendants' negligence, a much more difficult standard.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, the DNA may be {{encapsulated}} {{in protein}} to facilitate cell entry. If this capsid protein {{is included in}} the DNA, the resulting vaccine can combine the potency of a live vaccine without reversion risks. In 1983, Enzo Paoletti and Dennis Panicali at the New York Department of Health devised a strategy to produce recombinant DNA vaccines by using genetic engineering to transform ordinary <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccine</b> into vaccines that may be able to prevent other diseases. They altered the DNA of cowpox virus by inserting a gene from other viruses (namely Herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B and influenza).|$|E
25|$|After Edward Jenner {{introduced}} the <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccine</b> in 1798, variolation declined and was banned in some countries. As with variolation, {{there was some}} religious opposition to vaccination, although this was balanced to some extent by support from clergymen, such as Reverend Robert Ferryman, a friend of Jenner's, and Rowland Hill, who not only preached in its favour but also performed vaccination themselves. There was also opposition from some variolators who saw {{the loss of a}} lucrative monopoly. William Rowley published illustrations of deformities allegedly produced by vaccination, lampooned in James Gillray's famous caricature depicted on this page, and Benjamin Moseley likened cowpox to syphilis, starting a controversy that would last into the 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|The New England Journal of Medicine {{said that}} antivaccinationist {{activities}} {{resulted in a}} high cost to society, [...] "including damage to individual and community well-being from outbreaks of previously controlled diseases, withdrawal of vaccine manufacturers from the market, compromising of national security (in the case of anthrax and <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines),</b> and lost productivity".|$|R

From {{the beginning of the}} 20th century onwards, the elimination or control of disease in tropical countries became a driving force for all colonial powers. The sleeping sickness epidemic in Africa was arrested due to mobile teams systematically screening millions of people at risk. In the 20th century, the world saw the biggest increase in its population in human history due to lessening of the mortality rate in many countries due to medical advances. The world population has grown from 1.6 billion in 1900 to an estimated 7 billion today.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th Century {{vaccination}} {{was done}} either directly with vaccine produced on the skin of calves or, particularly in England, with vaccine obtained from the calf but then maintained by arm-to-arm transfer; initially in both cases vaccine could be dried on ivory points for short term storage or transport but increasing use was made of glass capillary tubes for this purpose towards {{the end of the}} century. During this period there were no adequate methods for assessing the safety of the vaccine and there were instances of contaminated vaccine transmitting infections such as erysipelas, tetanus, septicaemia and tuberculosis. In the case of arm-to-arm transfer there was also the risk of transmitting syphilis. Although this did occur occasionally, estimated as 750 cases in 100 million vaccinations, some critics of vaccination e.g. Charles Creighton believed that uncontaminated vaccine itself was a cause of syphilis. <b>Smallpox</b> <b>vaccine</b> was the only vaccine available during this period, and so the determined opposition to it initiated a number of vaccine controversies that spread to other vaccines and into the 21st century.|$|E
40|$|The 2003 monkeypox virus (MPXV) {{outbreak}} {{and subsequent}} laboratory studies {{demonstrated that the}} black-tailed prairie dog is susceptible to MPXV infection and that the ensuing rash illness is similar to human systemic orthopoxvirus (OPXV) infection, including a 7 - to 9 -day incubation period and, likely, in some cases a respiratory route of infection; these features distinguish this model from others. The need for safe and efficacious vaccines for OPVX in areas where it is endemic or epidemic is important to protect an increasingly OPXV-naïve population. In this study, we tested current and investigational <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines</b> for safety, induction of anti-OPXV antibodies, and protection against mortality and morbidity in two MPXV challenges. None of the <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines</b> caused illness in this model, and all vaccinated animals showed anti-OPXV antibody responses and neutralizing antibody. We tested vaccine efficacy by challenging the animals with 105 or 106 PFU Congo Basin MPXV 30 days postvaccination and evaluating morbidity and mortality. Our results demonstrated that vaccination with either Dryvax or Acambis 2000 protected the animals from death with no rash illness. Vaccination with IMVAMUNE also protected the animals from death, albeit with (modified) rash illness. Based {{on the results of}} this study, we believe prairie dogs offer a novel and potentially useful small animal model for the safety and efficacy testing of <b>smallpox</b> <b>vaccines</b> in pre- and postexposure vaccine testing, which is important for public health planning...|$|R
