50|$|Single panel {{doors are}} {{constructed}} from one monolithic panel. From the closed position a single panel door swings up and overhead with a hinge on each <b>side</b> (known as <b>jamb</b> type hardware) to the fully open position. A disadvantage of monolithic panel doors {{is that the}} swing up arc of the door occurs partially outside the garage. This means a vehicle must stop and park several {{feet in front of}} the door to avoid being hit by the garage door when it is opened.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "bold", [...] "impressive", [...] "solid and powerful" [...] chancel arch is the {{principal}} structural feature inside. [...] It dates from the 11th century and is flanked {{by a pair of}} arched recesses, one of which retains some original plasterwork. [...] These may have served as squints originally. [...] The structure dominates the nave through its sheer height, the use of massive square stone blocks with a smooth, plain finish, and the three [...] moulded shafts on each <b>side.</b> [...] The <b>jambs</b> terminate in bulky chamfered imposts. [...] The arch has been compared to that of another Grade I-listed Anglo-Saxon church in West Sussex—the slightly older St Nicholas' Church at Worth. [...] Its three bells date from the early 15th century (by Richard Hille), the 1470s (Henry Jurdan) and 1713 (Samuel Knight). [...] Hille owned a foundry in London; his bells are found at several other churches throughout Sussex.|$|R
5000|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} of the 1967 model, Yenko {{continued}} to produce his Yenko Super Camaros for 1968. All of the 1968 Yenko Super Camaros started life with the L78 396 in³ [...] hp engine and close ratio 4-speed Muncie transmission. They were all built as Super Sport cars but only the Yenko-ordered cars came with the 9737 COPO appointments which included a 140 mi/h km/h Delco speedometer, a special Magic Mirror trim tag and a large 1 1/8th inch front anti-sway bar. Yenko swapped out the factory 396 in³ short-block for the L72 427 in³ [...] short-block reusing all {{of the rest of the}} 396 in³ engine's components including the heads, carburetor, intake manifold, etc. He swapped the stock hood for a twin-snorkel fiberglass one he had made along with other features including Pontiac's 14"x6" [...] steel wheels with special Yenko caps, Yenko emblems gracing the front grill, front fenders and tail panel and 427 emblems were added to the tail panel and front fenders as well. Other additions included a Yenko Super Camaro serial-numbered tag in the driver's <b>side</b> door <b>jamb</b> and Stewart Warner pedestal-mounted tachometer and gauges were installed in the interior. Early cars got a rear spoiler made for Yenko and later cars all got the factory spoilers front and rear. The recognized production number for these cars is approx 64 cars converted, with well less than half of that number known to exist today.|$|R

The lintel is larger in size than the door-frame, extending a little on each <b>side</b> of the <b>jambs.</b> It is richly decorated with architectural carvings which are placed in a symmetrical form, similar to the architectural features seen in the fifth and sixth century temples in Pataliputra and Benares. Five Chaitya-windows (horse-shoe shaped) are carved in the front face of the lintel - three large and two small - with the figurine of a male with four arms carved in the extreme right window seated on a throne; two of its arms are damaged while one arm is seen holding Shiva's damaru. At the base of this throne there is a carving {{in the form of}} sea waves. The central window has a Shiva carving known as [...] "Lakulisa", meaning Lord with the staff, a rope tied to its leg and is flanked by two mythical deities, called [...] "suparna", anthropomorphic figures of a bird and man. Also seen in this window are two females figures. In another window is a depiction of man playing the flute, and with a hooded snake feature above his head. The window to the extreme right has carving of Surya, the Sun god, in a cross-legged posture holding a lotus flower. Two attendants are seen next to this figure, one is offering betel leaves (pan) while holding an ink pot in the other hand, and the second attendant is carrying a stick.|$|R
