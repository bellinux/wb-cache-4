50|$|In {{the event}} that there are high levels of copper present, {{leaching}} of the precipitate using nitric or <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids</b> may be required.|$|R
50|$|A hydrolyzable tannin or pyrogallol-type tannin {{is a type}} of tannin that, on heating with {{hydrochloric}} or <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids,</b> yields gallic or ellagic acids.|$|R
50|$|Organosulfur {{compounds}} are efficient hydroperoxide decomposers, which thermally {{stabilize the}} polymers. <b>Sulfuric</b> <b>acids</b> are produced {{as the product}} of decomposition, which catalyse further hydroperoxide decomposition.|$|R
5|$|Mercury {{does not}} react with most acids, such as dilute <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid,</b> {{although}} oxidizing acids such as concentrated <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid</b> and nitric acid or aqua regia dissolve it to give sulfate, nitrate, and chloride. Like silver, mercury reacts with atmospheric hydrogen sulfide. Mercury reacts with solid sulfur flakes, {{which are used}} in mercury spill kits to absorb mercury (spill kits also use activated carbon and powdered zinc).|$|E

5|$|Rain is {{also known}} or {{suspected}} on other planets, where it may be composed of methane, neon, <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid,</b> or even iron rather than water.|$|E
30|$|Pretreatment {{of sample}} surface {{included}} mechanical polishing, polishing, degreasing, chemical etching {{in a mixture}} of 10 % hydrochloric acid and 10 % <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids,</b> thorough washing with distilled water, and drying.|$|R
50|$|Iron(III) oxide is {{insoluble}} {{in water}} but dissolves readily in strong acid, e.g. hydrochloric and <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids.</b> It also dissolves well in solutions of chelating agents such as EDTA and oxalic acid.|$|R
50|$|DNCB is {{produced}} commercially by the nitration of p-nitrochlorobenzene {{with a mixture}} of nitric and <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids.</b> Other methods afford the compound less efficiently include the chlorination of dinitrobenzene, nitration of o-nitrochlorobenzene and the dinitration of chlorobenzene.|$|R
5|$|<b>Sulfuric</b> <b>acid</b> is {{produced}} in the upper atmosphere by the Sun's photochemical action on carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and water vapour. Ultraviolet photons of wavelengths less than 169 nm can photodissociate carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and atomic oxygen. Atomic oxygen is highly reactive; when it reacts with sulfur dioxide, a trace component of the Venusian atmosphere, the result is sulfur trioxide, which can combine with water vapour, another trace component of Venus's atmosphere, to yield <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
5|$|The metal is {{produced}} from the oxide (reduced) either by electrolysis or by reacting the tellurium dioxide with sulfur dioxide in <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Acid {{digestion}} is a two-stage process, {{involving the}} use of up to 93% <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid</b> at 210–230°C. First, 60% <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid</b> is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid</b> is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid</b> is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300°C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot {{be added to the}} acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200°C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70°C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.|$|E
50|$|Bromoethane is {{inexpensive}} and would rarely be prepared in the laboratory. A laboratory synthesis includes reacting ethanol {{with a mixture}} of hydrobromic and <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids.</b> An alternate route involves refluxing ethanol with phosphorus and bromine; phosphorus tribromide is generated in situ.|$|R
50|$|These suffocating gases, {{which were}} {{probably}} carboxylic acid, were {{harmful to the}} population; the thick water-vapor, which condensed in a reddish color, rapidly spread unnoticed through the local vegetation (a mix chloric and <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids)</b> which were expelled as aqueous vapors.|$|R
50|$|TiH1.95 is {{unaffected}} by water and air. It is slowly attacked by strong acids and is degraded by hydrofluoric and hot <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids.</b> It reacts rapidly with oxidising agents, this reactivity {{leading to the}} use of titanium hydride in pyrotechnics.|$|R
5|$|Dark red, {{hygroscopic}} HTcO4 is {{a strong}} acid. In concentrated <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid,</b> − converts to the octahedral form TcO3(OH)(H2O)2, the conjugate base of the hypothetical triaquo complex +.|$|E

5|$|In the laboratory, {{hydrogen}} chloride gas {{may be made}} by drying the acid with concentrated <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid.</b> Deuterium chloride, DCl, may be produced by reacting benzoyl chloride with heavy water (D2O).|$|E
50|$|M57 FS (a {{solution}} of Sulfur trioxide in Chlorosulfonic acid) Chemical Smoke: 10.74 lb (4.87 kg), range max 2470 yd (2260 m); laid down dense white fog consisting of small droplets of hydrochloric and <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids.</b> In moderate concentrations, {{it is highly}} irritating to the eyes, nose, and skin.|$|R
50|$|It is {{critical}} that metal be perfectly clean and free from any type of oil or grease before applying a patina such as Rokusho. This can be done through a mild acid bath (oxalic or <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids</b> are frequently used), scrubbing with pumice, or using a surface abrasive.|$|R
50|$|The {{second largest}} {{industry}} in the city is chemical industry. Its main production area is concentrated in mineral fertilizers. 'PhosAgro' (LSE, MOEX) is the largest producer of phosphate based fertilizers and phosphoric and <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids</b> in Europe. It {{is also one of}} the leading producers of NPK fertilizers, ammonia and Ammonium nitrate in Russia.|$|R
5|$|Lutetium dissolves readily in weak {{acids and}} dilute <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid</b> to form {{solutions}} containing the colorless lutetium ions, which are coordinated by between seven and nine water molecules, the average being 3+.|$|E
5|$|Other archaea {{exist in}} very acidic or {{alkaline}} conditions. For example, {{one of the}} most extreme archaean acidophiles is Picrophilus torridus, which grows at pH0, which is equivalent to thriving in 1.2molar <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid</b> {{droplets}} can {{be highly}} electrically charged, and so they offer the potential for lightning. Venus' small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation. This radiation may result in cloud-to-cloud lightning discharges.|$|E
2500|$|In organic synthesis, {{industrial}} and otherwise, the nitro {{group is a}} versatile functional group. Most derivatives of aniline are prepared via nitration of aromatic compounds followed by reduction. Nitrations entail combining nitric and <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids</b> to generate the nitronium ion, which electrophilically reacts with aromatic compounds such as benzene. Many explosives, such as TNT, are prepared this way.|$|R
5000|$|Pure EGDN {{was first}} {{produced}} by the Belgian chemist Louis Henry (1834-1913) in 1870 by dropping {{a small amount of}} ethylene glycol into a mixture of nitric and <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids</b> cooled to 0 °C. [...] The previous year, August Kekulé had produced EGDN by the nitration of ethylene, but this was actually contaminated with beta-nitroethyl nitrate.|$|R
50|$|The company derives {{its name}} from a high silicon cast iron alloy, Duriron, which rapidly became an {{industry}} standard for handling extremely corrosive materials. Duriron “denitrating towers” were in high demand during the First World War for safe handling of hot mixtures of nitric and <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids</b> during the manufacturing of explosives. As {{a result of the}} war the company expanded tenfold, increasing its work force from 150 to 1500.|$|R
5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (an essential component of gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, saltpeter was in great demand in France. Saltpeter produced from French nitre beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid.</b> Courtois once added excessive <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid</b> and a cloud of purple vapour rose. He noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.|$|E
5|$|In a 2016 study, a {{team from}} Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research {{announced}} that the main cause for mass extinction was a severe drop in global temperatures caused by concentrations of large amount of droplets of <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid</b> in the atmosphere. Freezing temperatures lasted {{for at least three}} years.|$|E
5|$|In {{collections}} {{which contain}} fossils, high humidity can also affect pyrite (or its more reactive polymorph marcasite) (iron sulphide) fossils {{in a somewhat}} similar condition, which is known as pyrite disease. The iron sulfide can react with water and oxygen to form iron sulfates and <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acid,</b> which then can produce Bynesian decay.|$|E
40|$|An {{effort was}} made to study the effects of cation and anion {{additions}} on oxygen evolution kinetics on platinum and the inhibitive or catalytic nature of the additions. The kinetics and mechanism of oxygen evolution on planitum metal in hydrofluoric and <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids,</b> including the effects of foreign anions, were examined. The LEED-Auger-thin layer electrochemical system was developed for the examination of electrocatalytic surfaces. Samples for electrocatalytic LEED-Auger studies were prepared and examined...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} to this process, {{depending on the}} type of substrate being plated. Different substrates need different etching solutions, such as hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, and <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids.</b> Ferric chloride is also popular for the etching of nimonic alloys. Sometimes the component enters the chrome plating vat while electrically live. Sometimes the component has a conforming anode made from lead/tin or platinized titanium. A typical hard chrome vat plates at about [...] per hour.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{processes}} of nitration of 2 -methylimidazole to produce 2 -methyl- 4 (5) -nitroimidazole are considered in this paper. The {{processes of}} nitration by mixture of nitric and <b>sulfuric</b> <b>acids</b> and nitrate salts of alkali metals were compared. It was found the nitration of nitrate salts of alkali metal proceeds smoother. The yield {{of the desired}} product 2 -methyl- 4 (5) -nitroimidazole was 85 % and 95 % in case of nitric acid and nitrate salt...|$|R
