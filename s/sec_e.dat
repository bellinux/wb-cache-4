Granitic breccia overlies Karroo sediment in places, indicating a post-Karroo age for the cratering event. The coincidence of the spacial occurrence of the crater with respect to various alkaline and ultramafic intrusives has been the main argument put for yard against an impact origin for the structure. Detailed mapping of the crater rim exposures and the crater environs was carried out and revealed many occurrences of intrusives in the whole region. Structural analysis along the rim revealed the presence of typical impact crater related structures. Comparative petrographic and chemical studies of crater-related and non-related intrusives showed close similarities between these sample suites...|$|E

We had conducted two parallel empirical studies, one on the 3 domains and the other one on the 4 domains obtained from expanding the 3 with the dataset of Caltech- 256. While both sets of empirical studies have reached the same findings that validate our methods, we chose to focus on domain adaptation among the 4 domains to demonstrate that our methods are robust to the additional diversity beyond the original 3. To be comprehensive, we report our results on those 3 domains as they provide a worthy reference point to contrast our work directly to published ones. • empirical studies of domain adaptation between Cal-tech, Amazon, Webcam and DSLR (Sec.

40|$|The exocyst is an octameric complex {{required}} for polarized secretion. Some {{components of the}} exocyst are found on the plasma membrane, whereas others are recruited to Golgi membranes, suggesting that exocyst assembly tethers vesicles to their site of fusion. We have found that in Drosophila melanogaster oocytes {{the majority of the}} exocyst component Sec 5 is unexpectedly present in clathrin-coated pits and vesicles at the plasma membrane. In oocytes, the major substrate for clathrin-dependent endocytosis is the vitellogenin receptor Yolkless. A truncation mutant of Sec 5 (<b>sec</b> 5 <b>E</b> 13) allows the formation of normally sized oocytes but with greatly reduced yolk uptake. We find that in <b>sec</b> 5 <b>E</b> 13 oocytes Yolkless accumulates aberrantly in late endocytic compartments, indicating a defect in the endocytic cycling of the receptor. An analogous truncation of the yeast SEC 5 gene results in normal secretion but a temperature-sensitive defect in endocytic recycling. Thus, the exocyst may act in both Golgi to plasma membrane traffic and endocytic cycling, and hence in oocytes is recruited to clathrin-coated pits to facilitate the rapid recycling of Yolkless...|$|R
