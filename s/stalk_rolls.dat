40|$|Growers of 38 –cm (15 –in.) narrow row corn {{typically}} {{use either}} a wider row cornhead or locally modify an existing head to this row spacing. A three–year field experiment compared visible machine losses of a 76 –cm (30 –in.) cornhead used on 76 –cm (30 –in.) and 38 –cm (15 –in.) rows {{and a single}} gathering chain 38 –cm (15 –in.) cornhead used on 38 –cm (15 –in.) rows. Total machine losses were divided into head and threshing/separating losses. On matched row spacing, machine losses were generally similar between the 76 – and 38 –cm (30 – and 15 –in.) cornhead. However, one–year losses from the 76 –cm (30 –in.) cornhead were statistically lower. Machine ear drop losses were excessive [0. 9 to 1. 3 Mg/ha (15 to 20 bu/acre) in two of three years] and unacceptable when a 76 –cm (30 –in.) cornhead was used even at low 3. 2 –km/h (2 –mph) travel speeds to harvest corn in 38 –cm (15 –in.) rows. At low feed rates, over 90 % of machine losses occurred at the cornhead {{rather than in the}} threshing, separating, and cleaning areas. Header losses occurred due to ear drop from late season harvest and negligible losses inside the machine when operated at 4. 8 km/h (3 mph). Although shelling of kernels on the <b>stalk</b> <b>rolls</b> was about 1 % of harvested yield or less, ear drop loss from the cornhead was greater than this amount in two of three years...|$|E

40|$|Structural {{engineering}} ceramics {{are widely}} used {{in all kinds of}} engineering fields for their advantages of wear resistance, corrosion resistance, abrasion resistance and high temperature resistance. The ceramics have been used for turbo-chargers, gas turbines, auto heat engines, <b>rolls,</b> <b>stalks</b> and conveying rollers. However, {{it is not easy to}} utilize large ceramics material in many kinds of engineering fields more efficiently because of their high cost of machining and low fracture toughness compared with metallic material. In this study, the maximum stresses of ceramics structure will be mainly considered by the application of the finite element method. Then, how to reduce the maximum stress will be investigated with varying dipping speeds for ceramics tube,and with varying the dimensions of the structure for conveying rollers. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:工博甲第 307 号 学位授与年月日:平成 22 年 9 月 30 日 1.
