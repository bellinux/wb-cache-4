50|$|Hydraulic or {{electric}} actuators add controlled {{energy to the}} steering mechanism, so the driver can provide less effort to turn the <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> when driving at typical speeds, and reduce considerably the physical effort necessary to turn the wheels when a vehicle is stopped or moving slowly. Power steering can also be engineered to provide some artificial feedback of forces acting on the <b>steered</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{second type}} of {{steering}} used is <b>steered</b> <b>wheel</b> control AGV. This type of steering can be similar to a cars steering. But this is not very manoeuvrable. It is more common to use a three-wheeled vehicle similar to a conventional three wheeled forklift. The drive wheel is the turning wheel. It is more precise in following the programmed path than the differential speed controlled method. This type of AGV has smoother turning. <b>Steered</b> <b>wheel</b> control AGV {{can be used in}} all applications; unlike the differential controlled. [...] <b>Steered</b> <b>wheel</b> control is used for towing and can also at times have an operator control it.|$|R

50|$|A {{steering}} wheel is a wheel that turns {{to change the}} direction of a vehicle. A trailer wheel is one that is neither a drive <b>wheel,</b> nor a <b>steer</b> <b>wheel.</b> Front-wheel drive vehicles typically have the rear wheels as trailer wheels.|$|R
50|$|Brake fade {{failures}} can cascade. For example, {{a typical}} 5-axle truck/trailer combination has 10 brakes. If one brake fades, brake load {{is transferred to}} the remaining 9 brakes, causing them to work harder, get hotter, and thus fade more. Where fade is non-uniform, fade may cause a vehicle to swerve. Because of this, heavy vehicles often use disproportionately weak brakes on <b>steered</b> <b>wheels,</b> which hurts the stopping distance and causes brakes on non-steered wheels to work harder, worsening fade. An advantage of low-fade brakes such as disc brakes is <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> can do more braking without causing brake steer.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanical}} energy that motors and engines produce must {{be converted to}} work by wheels, propellers, nozzles, or similar means. Aside from converting {{mechanical energy}} into motion, wheels allow a vehicle to roll along a surface and, {{with the exception of}} railed vehicles, to be <b>steered.</b> <b>Wheels</b> are ancient technology, with specimens being discovered from over 5000 years ago. Wheels are used in a plethora of vehicles, including motor vehicles, armoured personnel carriers, amphibious vehicles, airplanes, trains, skateboards and wheelbarrows.|$|E
50|$|Many modern cars use {{rack and}} pinion {{steering}} mechanisms, where the steering wheel turns the pinion gear; the pinion moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the pinion, converting circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to side motion). This motion applies steering torque to the swivel pin ball joints that replaced previously used kingpins of the stub axle of the <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> via tie rods and a short lever arm called the steering arm.|$|E
50|$|The {{caster angle}} or castor angle is the angular {{displacement}} of the steering axis from the vertical axis of a <b>steered</b> <b>wheel</b> in a car, motorcycle, bicycle or other vehicle, measured in the longitudinal direction. It is the angle between the pivot line (in a car an imaginary line {{that runs through the}} centre of the upper ball joint to the centre of the lower ball joint) and vertical. Car racers sometimes adjust caster angle to optimise their car's handling characteristics in particular driving situations.|$|R
50|$|This action puts {{strain on}} the rack and pinion, pump, tie rods, and bearings, {{especially}} causes undue wear to the <b>steer</b> <b>wheels,</b> and can be exceptionally difficult {{in the absence of}} power-assisted steering. Although in most modern cars the steering components are sturdy enough to handle dry steering without taking damage, it is still not recommended due to stronger tire wear. This is the reason automatic parking systems are usually designed not to dry steer, although their design would be somewhat simpler if they used dry steering.|$|R

50|$|As the <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are also}} the driven wheels, FF (front-engine, {{front-wheel-drive}} layout) cars are generally considered superior to FR (front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout) cars in conditions such as snow, mud, or wet tarmac. The weight of the engine over the driven wheels also improves grip in such conditions. However, powerful cars rarely use the FF layout because weight transference under acceleration reduces the weight on the front wheels and reduces their traction, limiting the torque which can be utilized. Electronic traction control can avoid wheelspin but largely negates the benefit of extra torque/power.|$|E
50|$|Recumbent tadpole {{or reverse}} trike is a {{recumbent}} design with two <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> {{at the front}} and one driven wheel at the back, though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers. Steering is either through a single handlebar linked with tie rods to the front wheels' stub axle assemblies (indirect) or with two handlebars (rather, two half-handlebars) each bolted to a steerer tube, usually through a bicycle-type headset and connected to a stub axle assembly (direct). A single tie rod connects {{the left and right}} axle assemblies.|$|E
50|$|Diesel-electric {{arrangements}} are used on many railway locomotives, ships, large mining trucks, and some bulldozers. In these cases, each driven wheel {{is equipped with}} its own electric motor, which can be fed varying electrical power to provide any required torque or power output for each wheel independently. This produces a much simpler solution for multiple driven wheels in very large vehicles, where drive shafts would be much larger or heavier than the electrical cable that can provide {{the same amount of}} power. It also improves the ability to allow different wheels to run at different speeds, which is useful for <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> in large construction vehicles.|$|E

A 4 DOF model with nonlinear tire and SBW subsystem is presented using {{hardware in the loop}} method. Since some space variables cannot be measured, an estimator is used to extract the measurable variables from the simulated model and convert them to the required variables of the controller. These variables are transmitted to the controller and then it adopts itself with new conditions and applies the best modification on the steering. The results reveal that the proposed controller can significantly improve vehicle handling during severe maneuvers...|$|R
50|$|Rear wheel {{steering}} {{tends to be}} unstable because in turns the steering geometry changes hence decreasing the turn radius (over steer), rather than increase it (under <b>steer).</b> Rear <b>wheel</b> steering is meant for slower vehicles that need high-maneuverability in tight spaces, e.g. fork lifts.|$|R

Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, a suitably defined extended task error and exterior penalty function approach, a class of simple non-linear controllers converging in a finite time, which fulfil control and state constraints, is proposed. The numerical simulation results carried out for a mobile manipulator consisting of a nonholonomic differentially <b>steered</b> <b>wheeled</b> mobile platform and a holonomic manipulator of two revolute kinematic pairs, operating both in a two-dimensional unconstrained work space and work space including the obstacles, illustrate performance of the proposed controller...|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} with the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (RWD), the FWD layout {{eliminates the need for}} a central tunnel or a higher chassis clearance to accommodate a driveshaft providing power to the rear wheels. Like the rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (RR) and rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (RMR) layouts, it places the engine over the drive wheels, improving traction in many applications. As the <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> are also the driven wheels, FWD cars are generally considered superior to RWD cars in conditions where there is low traction such as snow, mud, gravel or wet tarmac. When hill climbing in low traction conditions RR is considered the best two-wheel-drive layout, primarily due to the shift of weight to the rear wheels when climbing. The cornering ability of a FWD vehicle is generally better, because the engine is placed over the <b>steered</b> <b>wheels.</b> However, as the driven wheels have the additional demands of steering, if a vehicle accelerates quickly, less grip is available for cornering, which can result in understeer. [...] High-performance vehicles rarely use the FWD layout because weight is transferred to the rear wheels under acceleration, while unloading the front wheels and sharply reducing their grip, effectively putting a cap on the amount of power which could realistically be utilized; in addition, the high horsepower of high-performance cars can result in the sensation of torque steer. Electronic traction control can avoid wheel-spin but largely negates the benefit of extra power. [...] This was a reason for the adoption of the four-wheel-drive quattro system in the high performance Jensen FF and Audi Quattro road cars.|$|E
50|$|The <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> on a velomobile {{will hit}} the fairing if steered sharply enough. Making the fairing wider can give space to steer the wheels more sharply, but has down-sides for {{aerodynamics}} and width. Although sharp steering is not needed at speed, many aerodynamic velomobiles have a much worse turning circle than an equivalent unfaired cycle. In contrast an unfaired cycle cannot have fairing interference, and so even with the same wheel and rider configuration can steer a much tighter circle. Steering only the rear wheel(s) would avoid fairing interference, {{but it is hard}} to build a stable vehicle using only rear-wheel steering. The Velayo uses a tricycle configuration and steers only the rear wheel; but it was produced only in small numbers. The experimental Kingsbury Fortuna and Quattro velomobiles steered all wheels; this approach avoids some of the stability problems of rear-wheel steering while still reducing the steering angle of the front wheels. However, this approach has not (as of 2017) gained wider use in velomobiles.|$|E
5000|$|Rather {{than the}} {{preceding}} [...] "turntable" [...] steering, where both front wheels turned around a common pivot, each wheel gained its own pivot, {{close to its}} own hub. While more complex, this arrangement enhances controllability by avoiding large inputs from road surface variations being applied {{to the end of}} a long lever arm, as well as greatly reducing the fore-and-aft travel of the <b>steered</b> <b>wheels.</b> A linkage between these hubs pivots the two wheels together, and by careful arrangement of the linkage dimensions the Ackermann geometry could be approximated. This was achieved by making the linkage not a simple parallelogram, but by making the length of the track rod (the moving link between the hubs) shorter than that of the axle, so that the steering arms of the hubs appeared to [...] "toe out". As the steering moved, the wheels turned according to Ackermann, with the inner wheel turning further. If the track rod is placed ahead of the axle, it should instead be longer in comparison, thus preserving this same [...] "toe out".|$|E

The utilization {{of a new}} wheel concept called the AZIMUT wheel allowed us to create an innovative omnidirectional non-holonomic robot. Novelty of this wheel concept resides in the non-conventional positioning of the steering axis and the wheel axis. We propose a kinematical model based on the geometrical constraints of these wheels. The degree of mobility, steerability and maneuverability are studied. Additionally, we describe a special design implementation of the wheel mechanism to overcome a hypermotorization issue inherent to the wheelâs geometrical properties.

Su cient conditions for converting a multiple-input system with nonholonomic velocity constraints into a multiple-chain, singlegenerator chained form via state feedback and a coordinate transformation are presented along with sinusoidal and polynomial control algorithms to steer such systems. Our example is the three-input nonholonomic system of a re truck, or tiller truck. In this three-axle system, the control inputs are the steering velocities of both the rst and third (or tiller) axles and the forward driving velocity of the truck. Simulation results are given for parallel parking, left hand turning, right hand turning, and changing lanes. Comparison is made to the same vehicle without tiller steering...|$|R

5000|$|The fairing on a velomobile {{sometimes}} {{makes it}} more subject to cross-winds than a similar unfaired cycle. The effect of cross-winds is complicated because {{the force of the}} wind can act as a steering force, as-if the rider had tried to steer the cycle. [...] "Wind steer" [...] can be a safety issue and may also hurt performance, as a serpentine path is longer and thus slower than a straight line. Thus, a design with inferior aerodynamics may be better overall. For example, it is common for time-trial bicycles to use a solid disk rear wheel for best aerodynamics, and a spoked front wheel that has worse aerodynamics than a disk, but is less likely to steer the bicycle in a cross-wind. Velomobile fairings have analogous concerns, leading to trade-offs in fairing design. For example, a longer [...] "tail" [...] on the fairing will increase the total side-wind profile and total side forces, but can reduce the percentage force acting on the <b>steered</b> <b>wheels</b> and so an improve stability in side winds. A larger fairing also hurts weight and has more skin drag), but as with time-trial bicycles, worse aerodynamics but better handling is sometimes a good trade-off.|$|E
50|$|With the DAF 600 - 55 each {{rear wheel}} was {{propelled}} individually {{by a pair}} of conical drums and drive belt with the effect of a limited slip differential: if a drive wheel on slippery road revs up, the other wheel can still transfer the full torque. This results in unusually good traction characteristics, which were also a reason for successes of the DAFs in rallies. There were several disadvantages that accompanied the lack of a true differential gear. Although each belt could settle (independent of the other) into its optimum position, thus allowing for wheel speed variation, the system was slow to operate and depended on the pulleys being turned. This led to rapid tire wear and placed stress on other transmission components. Snapped drive shafts were common. Low speed handling in icy conditions was interesting as the system tended to drive the car forward against the influence of the <b>steered</b> <b>wheels.</b> Later cars, the 46, 66 and Volvo variants were fitted with a differentially geared axle. A version with a differential was developed by Williams in the 1993 Williams FW15C CVT Formula One car, but it was banned before being raced. In testing there were problems with the heat production.|$|E
