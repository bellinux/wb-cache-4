40|$|BACKGROUND: Change in left {{ventricular}} end-systolic volume (∆LVESV) {{is the most}} frequently used <b>surrogate</b> <b>marker</b> in measuring response to cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT). We investigated whether ∆LVESV is the best measure to discriminate between a favourable and unfavourable outcome and whether this is equally applicable to non-ischaemic and ischaemic cardiomyopathy. METHODS: 205 CRT patients (age 65 [*]±[*] 12 years, 69 [*]% men) were included. At baseline and 6 months echocardiographic studies, exercise testing and laboratory measurements were performed. CRT response was assessed by: ∆LVESV, ∆LV ejection fraction (LVEF), ∆ interventricular mechanical delay, ∆VO 2 peak, ∆VE/VCO 2, ∆BNP, ∆creatinine, ∆NYHA, and ∆QRS. These were correlated to the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) between 6 and 24 months. RESULTS: MACE occurred in 19 [*]% of the patients (non-ischaemic: 13 [*]%, ischaemic: 24 [*]%). ∆LVESV remained the only <b>surrogate</b> <b>marker</b> for CRT response for the total population and patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy, showing areas under the curve (AUC) of 0. 69 and 0. 850, respectively. For ischaemic cardiomyopathy, ∆BNP was the best <b>surrogate</b> <b>marker</b> showing an AUC of 0. 66. CONCLUSION: ∆LVESV is an excellent <b>surrogate</b> <b>marker</b> measuring CRT response concerning long-term outcome for non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. ∆LVESV is not suitable for ischaemic cardiomyopathy in which measuring CRT response remains difficult...|$|R

40|$|Background & objectives: The {{emergence}} {{of resistance to}} fluoroquinolones in enteric fever despite the pathogen being susceptible by in vitro laboratory results, led to repeated changes in Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines for this class of antibiotics to have specific and sensitive interpretative criteria. In 2015, CLSI added pefloxacin disk diffusion criteria as a <b>surrogate</b> <b>marker</b> for fluoroquinolone susceptibility. This study was carried out {{to evaluate the use}} of pefloxacin as a <b>surrogate</b> <b>marker</b> for ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin susceptibility in clinical isolates of Salmonella Typhi and S. Paratyphi A. Methods: A total of 412 strains of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A were studied for pefloxacin disk diffusion test as a <b>surrogate</b> <b>marker</b> for susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin as per CLSI and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines. Molecular mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones were also determined and correlated with pefloxacin susceptibility breakpoints. Results: Of the total 412 strains, 34 were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and 33 each to levofloxacin and ofloxacin using CLSI minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. There was a positive correlation between MICs with correlation coefficients 0. 917, 0. 896 and 0. 958 for the association between ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and ofloxacin and levofloxacin, respectively (P < 0. 001). The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of pefloxacin as a <b>surrogate</b> <b>marker</b> using ciprofloxacin MIC as a gold standard were 100, 99. 5 and 94. 4 per cent, while 100, 99. 2 and 91. 7 per cent taking ofloxacin and levofloxacin MIC as gold standard. Mutations in target genes correlated with the pefloxacin susceptibility results. Interpretation & conclusions: Our results showed that pefloxacin served as a good <b>surrogate</b> <b>marker</b> for the detection of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin in S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A. Further studies are required to confirm these findings...|$|R
40|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 20 th century efforts to improve medical care became known as the quality movement.

Although patient-centered outcomes were initially examined, these were replaced with <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers.</b> Many of the <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> were weakly or non-evidence based interventions. Furthermore, the <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> were often “bundled”, some evidence-based and some not. These guidelines, <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> and bundles were rarely subjected to beta testing, and when carefully scrutinized, rarely correlated with improved patient-centered outcomes.

40|$|Summary: Interest is {{increasing}} {{rapidly in the}} use of <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> as primary measures of the effectiveness of investigational drugs in definitive drug trials. Many such <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> have been proposed as potential candidates for use in definitive effectiveness trials of agents to treat neurologic or psychiatric disease, but as of this date, there are no such markers that have been adequately “validated,” that is, shown to predict the effect of the treatment on the clinical outcome of interest. While the current law and regulations permit the United States Food and Drug Administration to base the approval of a drug product on a determination the effect of the drug on an unvalidated surrogate marker (that is, one for which it is not known that an effect on the surrogate actually predicts the desired clinical benefit), {{there are a number of}} difficulties in interpreting trials that use <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> as primary measures of drug effect.

40|$|High {{failure rates}} of metal-on-metal hip {{arthroplasty}} implants have highlighted {{the need for}} more careful introduction and monitoring of new implants and for the evaluation of the safety of medical devices. The National Joint Registry and other regulatory services are unable to detect failing implants at an early enough stage. We aimed to identify validated <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> of long-term outcome in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). We conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> for predicting long-term outcome in primary THA. Long-term outcome was defined as revision rate of an implant at ten years according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines. We conducted a search of Medline and Embase (OVID) databases. Separate search strategies were devised for the Cochrane database and Google Scholar. Each search was performed to include articles from the date of their inception to June 8, 2015. Our search strategy identified 1082 studies of which 115 studies were included for full article review. Following review, 17 articles were found that investigated <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> of long-term outcome. These included one systematic review, one randomised control trial (RCT), one case control study and 13 case series. Validated <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> included Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA) and Einzel-Bild-Röntgen-Analyse (EBRA), each measuring implant migration and wear. We identified five RSA studies (one systematic review and four case series) and four EBRA studies (one RCT and three case series). Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) at six months have been investigated but have not been validated against long-term outcomes. This systematic review identified two validated <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> of long-term primary THA outcome: RSA and EBRA, each measuring implant migration and wear. We recommend the consideration of RSA in the pre-market testing of new implants. EBRA can be used to investigate acetabular wear but not femoral migration.
