5|$|In 1973, {{during her}} {{studies at the}} National University of La Plata, she met her future spouse, Néstor Kirchner. They were married on 9 May 1975 and had two children: Máximo (1977) and Florencia (1990). Néstor Kirchner died on 27 October 2010 after {{suffering}} a heart attack. Following {{the death of her}} husband, <b>she</b> <b>dressed</b> in black for over three years.|$|E
5|$|On July 7, {{the morning}} of Beauchamp's {{scheduled}} execution, Anna requested that the guard allow her privacy while <b>she</b> <b>dressed.</b> Anna tried another overdose on laudanum, {{but was unable to}} keep it down. She had smuggled a knife into the cell, and the couple attempted another double suicide by stabbing themselves with it. When they were discovered, Anna was taken to the jailer's home and tended to by doctors.|$|E
5|$|Ginetta, then {{seventeen}} years old, was already {{active in the}} resistance movement, delivering food coupons and clothing to Jews who were in hiding. Following her parents' disappearance, she became a courier for resistance forces in Northern Italy, as well as helping to print and distribute antigovernment pamphlets. On one occasion, <b>she</b> <b>dressed</b> as a cleaning lady to steal letterhead from government offices {{so that it could}} be used to forge letters of safe passage to Switzerland. Due to her energy and small size (she never grew to more than five feet tall), she received the nickname Topolino ("Little Mouse").|$|E

5|$|Her friendships {{were limited}} to her ladies-in-waiting, and in {{particular}} Dona Josefina da Fonseca Costa. She was well liked by her attendants, a good judge {{of the character of}} visitors and courtiers, unpretentious, generous, kindly and an affectionate mother and grandmother. <b>She</b> <b>dressed</b> and acted modestly, only wearing jewelry for occasions of state, and gave the impression of being somewhat sad. She had no interest in politics and occupied her time writing letters, reading, doing needlework, and attending to religious obligations and charitable projects. She possessed a beautiful voice, and often practiced her singing skills. Her appreciation for music also meant that she enjoyed opera and balls.|$|E
5|$|Isabelle Wilhelmine Marie Eberhardt (17 February 1877– 21 October 1904) was a Swiss {{explorer}} and writer. As a teenager, Eberhardt, {{educated in}} Switzerland by her father, published short stories under a male pseudonym. She {{became interested in}} North Africa, and was considered a proficient writer on the subject despite learning about the region only through correspondence. After an invitation from photographer Louis David, Eberhardt moved to Algeria in May 1897. <b>She</b> <b>dressed</b> as a man and converted to Islam, eventually adopting the name Si Mahmoud Saadi. Eberhardt's unorthodox behaviour made her an outcast among European settlers in Algeria and the French administration.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{was named}} to a 19-player roster for a match against Switzerland on August 20 in Sandy, Utah. Shortly after, she was {{replaced}} on the roster by Alyssa Naeher after she suffered a concussion with the Washington Spirit. She returned to the national team for a training camp {{at the end of}} August in order to prepare for two matches against Mexico in September as well as the 2014 CONCACAF Women's Championship in October. <b>She</b> <b>dressed</b> for both games against Mexico and was subsequently named to the roster for the 2014 CONCACAF Women's Championship that served as a qualification for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. This was the first CONCACAF qualifying roster that Harris made at the senior level. She made her fourth appearance for the national team in team's final group match against Haiti on October 20, 2014 in Washington, D.C. She played all 90 minutes and recorded her first career shut out in a 6–0 win for the United States. The United States {{went on to win the}} tournament after a 6–0 win over Costa Rica. Harris {{was named to}} the 24-player roster for the International Tournament of Brasilia in Brazil from December 10 to 21. While in Brazil, Harris sustained a broken pinky finger and underwent surgery in order to repair it. She recovered in time to fully participate in a 21-day training camp in 2015 from January 5 to 25 at the U.S. Soccer National Training Center in Carson, California.|$|E

25|$|When Jacob {{protested that}} his father would {{recognize}} the deception and curse {{him as soon as}} he felt him, since Esau was hairy and Jacob smooth-skinned, Rebecca said that the curse would be on her instead. Before she sent Jacob to his father, <b>she</b> <b>dressed</b> him in Esau's garments and laid goatskins on his arms and neck to simulate hairy skin.|$|E
25|$|This {{incident}} {{was a sign}} of Elizabeth's strong and distinctive personality. This difficult experience seems to have made her, {{for the first time in}} her young life, fully aware of the serious, even deadly, nature of her succession rights to the throne. When she made her first public appearance at court 18 months later, just turning 17, <b>she</b> <b>dressed</b> in a simple, somber manner with plain and unadorned hair. This contrasted sharply with the showy splendor of the other ladies present, as if she was trying to live down the scandal of her association with Thomas.|$|E
25|$|Punky's {{efforts to}} escape from Fenster {{included}} a trick pulled by Margaux, in which <b>she</b> <b>dressed</b> up and pretended to be Punky. Despite advocacy from Mike Fulton, Chillings placed Punky with a new foster family: the fabulously wealthy Jules and Tiffany Buckworth (Robert Casper and Joan Welles), the latter of whom did not take kindly at all to Punky's working-class playfulness. Things gradually returned to normal: Henry, {{back on his feet}} following surgery, opened up a glitzy new studio at the local mall; in the process, he reunited with Punky. At the conclusion of the story arc, Henry officially adopted Punky.|$|E

She torched the house and fled. Lamphere had helped her, he admitted, but she had not left by the road where he waited for her after the fire had been set. In the end, she had betrayed him, cutting across open fields and disappearing into the woods. Some accounts suggest that Lamphere admitted that {{he took her to}} Stillwell (a town about nine miles from La Porte) and saw her off on a train to Chicago.|$|E
25|$|Catherine was young, joyous and carefree; Mannox {{had taught}} her to play the virginals. She {{was too young to}} take part in {{administrative}} matters of State. Nevertheless, every night Sir Thomas Heneage, Groom of the Stool, came to her chamber to report on the King's well-being. No plans were made for a coronation, yet she still travelled downriver in the royal barge into the City of London to a gun salute and some acclamation. She was settled by jointure at Baynard Castle: little changed at court, other than the arrival of many Howards. Every day <b>she</b> <b>dressed</b> with new clothes in the French fashion bedecked with precious jewels. With ominous foresight the motto adopted read Non autre volonte que la sienne (No other wish but his), decorated in gold around her sleeves.|$|E
25|$|Queen Sophia Magdalena {{was of a}} shy and {{reserved}} character and was never {{a member of the}} King's inner circle. At the famous amateur court theater of Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena is occasionally named as participator in the documents: in 1777, for example <b>she</b> <b>dressed</b> as an Italian sailor and participated in a battle between Italian and Spanish sailors. Normally, however, it was rather her role to act as the passive lady of games and tournaments, and to decorate the winner with the award. She did her ceremonial duties, but disliked the vivid lifestyle of the Court around her outgoing spouse. As Queen, she was expected to do a great deal of representation, more than had been expected from previous queens because of her consort's love for representation. On formal occasions, she was at her best: she performed beautifully according to Court etiquette, and was seen as dignified and impressive. On 17 September 1784, for example, she cut the cord to let off the first air balloons from the Stockholm observatory. During the King's Italian journey in 1783–84, she hosted a grand formal public dinner every two weeks, court presentation and showed herself at the Royal Swedish Opera and at the French Theater, but otherwise preferred her solitude. This attracted attention as during the absence of the King, she had been expected to represent the royal couple all the more. During this time, she is said to have enjoyed nature trips in the country side, with only one lady in waiting and two footmen, but this was stopped, because it was deemed unsuitable. Several of her ladies-in-waiting were well known Swedish women of the era, among them The Three Graces, as Augusta von Fersen, Ulla von Höpken and Lovisa Meijerfelt were called, and the artists Marianne Ehrenström and Charlotta Cedercreutz. Sophia Magdalena was a popular Queen: the 22 July 1788, for example, during the absence of her spouse in Finland, several members of the Royal Dramatic Theater and the musical society Augustibröder, among them Bellman, took a spontaneous trip by boat from the capital to Ulriksdal Palace, where she was, and performed a poem by Bellman to her honor at the occasion of her name day.|$|E

[...] Instead, <b>she</b> <b>dressed</b> the Quidditch players in [...] "preppie sweaters, 19th century fencing breeches and arm guards." [...] Production designer Stuart Craig built the sets at Leavesden Studios, including Hogwarts Great Hall, basing it on many English cathedrals. Although originally asked to use an existing old street to film the Diagon Alley scenes, Craig decided to build his own set, comprising Tudor, Georgian and Queen Anne architecture.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} on the Born This Way Ball and [...] tours; in the latter <b>she</b> <b>dressed</b> up in a polka-dotted rubber outfit with tentacles growing out around her waist and her head.

Colonel Eugene Kobylinsky, the family's guard at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk, felt Tatiana [...] "had no liking for art. Maybe {{it would have}} been better for her had she been a man." [...] Others felt Tatiana's artistic talents were better expressed in handiwork and in her talent for choosing attractive fashions and creating elegant hair styles. Her mother's friend Anna Vyrubova later wrote that Tatiana had a great talent for making clothing, embroidery and crochet and that <b>she</b> <b>dressed</b> her mother's long hair as well as any professional hair stylist.|$|E

500|$|In 1973 the Walker Art Center curated a major {{exhibition}} of her work, which traveled for two years. In 1975 she designed the chapel of St. Peter's Lutheran Church in midtown Manhattan. When {{asked about her}} role as a Jewish artist creating Christian-themed art, Nevelson stated that her abstract work transcended religious barriers. Also in 1975, she created and installed a large wood sculpture titled Bicentennial Dawn at the new James A. Byrne United States Courthouse in Philadelphia. During the last half of her life, Nevelson solidified her fame and her persona, cultivating a personal style for her [...] "petite yet flamboyant" [...] self that contributed to her legacy: dramatic dresses, scarves and large false eyelashes. When Alice Neel asked Nevelson how <b>she</b> <b>dressed</b> so beautifully, Nevelson replied [...] "Fucking, dear, fucking", in reference to her sexually liberated lifestyle. The designer Arnold Scaasi created many of her clothes. Nevelson died on April 17, 1988.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also used as the {{penultimate}} number of Cyrus' Wonder World Tour (2009), her first world tour. The performances began with backup dancers in bodysuits marching as they emerged {{from the bottom of}} the stage. The banging of a gong announced Cyrus' arrival. <b>She</b> <b>dressed</b> in a white tank top and shorts, boots, and a metallic vest. Cyrus and the multiple backup dancers performed elaborate dance routines as images on overhead screens depicted geometric patterns. The dancers exited the stage by throwing themselves inside the stage as Cyrus prepared for the next performance. Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times, who attended the September 22, 2009, concert at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, referred to the performance of [...] "See You Again" [...] as an uptempo highlight that was, however, unable [...] "to give her fans a deeper idea of who she is and what her music means".|$|E

Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference [...] "started happening organically" [...] when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference [...] "in almost every show". Fey said that from then on [...] "it became a thing where [...] tried to keep it going", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a [...] "pretty high batting average". Fey attributed most of the references to Robert Carlock, who she described as [...] "the resident expert".
