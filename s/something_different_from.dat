25|$|Such is {{the system}} in outline. The {{historical}} position of the system lies in its relations to Kant, Schelling and Hegel. Cousin was opposed to Kant in asserting that the unconditioned {{in the form of}} infinite or absolute cause is but a mere unrealizable tentative or {{effort on the part of}} and <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> a mere negation, yet not equivalent to a positive thought. With Cousin the absolute as the ground of being is grasped positively by the intelligence, and it renders all else intelligible; it is not as with Kant a certain hypothetical or regulative need.|$|E
25|$|For Arthur Schopenhauer, a {{judgment}} {{is a combination}} or separation {{of two or more}} concepts. If {{a judgment}} is to be an expression of knowledge, it must have a sufficient reason or ground by which the judgment could be called true. Truth is the reference of a judgment to <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> itself which is its sufficient reason (ground). Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has material truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or formal. If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has transcendental truth.|$|E
25|$|Takahashi {{created the}} {{majority}} of the main scenario himself. Takahashi worked on the script alongside Yuichiro Takeda, a writer who had previously worked on Xenoblade Chronicles; and Kazuho Hyodo, who had written episodes for multiple Gundam series. The story of Xenoblade Chronicle X was substantially larger than Xenoblade Chronicles, with Takahashi and Takeda feeling that they could not handle the entire scenario themselves. On advice from Takeda, he brought in Hyodo. Due to Hyodo's extensive involvement in science fiction stories, Takahashi felt confident leaving much of the work to him. The choice of a science fiction setting was influenced by Takahashi's wish to do <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the fantasy setting of Xenoblade Chronicles. Xenoblade Chronicles X was the first time Hyodo had worked on a video game. One of the main goals for Takahashi was having humans and the robot Skells coexisting and functioning in the world. Due to the scale and experimental nature of the game, the Monolith Soft team made an effort {{to move away from the}} philosophical storylines their company had become known for with previous titles. Speaking about his goals for the game, Takahashi felt that he had finally created what he had wanted to since first founding Monolith Soft in 1999.|$|E

25|$|Much of the state’s {{economic}} activity {{is related to}} its border with the United States state of Arizona. People from both countries regularly cross the border to shop. The border crossings are essential {{to many of the}} communities that straddle the border, not only in the main crossings in Nogales and Agua Prieta, but also in the smaller ones such as Naco. On each side of the border, there is a fifteen km strip, which is designated as a commercial trade zone, where both Mexicans and United States citizens can enter with limited visa requirements. Many Arizonans travel and cross one of the crossings to eat and shop, mostly to experience <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> doing the same at home. Most spend only the day. The most popular of these border crossings is Nogales, which is just over an hour south from Tucson by highway. The main shopping street in Nogales is Avenida Obregón, which is crowded with pharmacies with lower prices than in the United States, stores selling knock offs of designer names such as Louis Vuitton, Cuban cigars, tequila, cheaper cigarettes and Mexican handcrafts, including some of the best work from artisans from Puebla, Guadalajara, Michoacán and Oaxaca. Although these stores cater mostly to Americans crossing the border, it is still possible to negotiate prices. Many of these communities on the Mexican side also have bars close to the port of entry, taking advantage of Mexico’s lower drinking age of 18.|$|E

When Lukather's record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he {{responded with a}} quip about his suitability for the project. The company {{wanted him to do}} the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs. The project was a challenge to Lukather, who had to be creative to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering the fundamental structures. He said of the album, [...] "But I never dreamt in a million years that I'd do a Christmas record." ...|$|E

[...] The new album, titled Sci-Fi Crimes was released on August 31, 2009, peaking at No.6 on the Billboard 200 album chart with sales of about 46,000, the highest entry onto the chart to date for the band., The album was praised by Jared Johnson of Allmusic for taking a step in a new direction in regards to the lyrics. Pete Loeffler normally wrote lyrics about personal subjects, however on Sci-Fi Crimes, he wrote of stories including apparitions, conspiracy theories, and erratic sleeping conditions. The tour following the release of Sci-Fi Crimes was in the Fall of 2009. Opening for Chevelle on this tour was Halestorm, Adelitas Way, and After Midnight Project.|$|E
500|$|Within the initiatory {{system of}} the ONA, there is an {{emphasis}} on practitioners adopting [...] "insight roles" [...] in which they work undercover among a politically extreme group {{for a period of}} six to eighteen months, thus gaining experience in <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> their normal life. Among the ideological trends that the ONA suggests its members adopt [...] "insight roles" [...] within are anarchism, Neo-Nazism, and Islamism, stating that aside from the personal benefits of such an involvement, membership of these groups has the benefit of undermining the Magian-Nazarene socio-political {{system of the}} West and thus helping to bring about the instability from which a new order, the Imperium, can emerge. However, Monette noted a potential shift in the insight roles recommended by the group over the decades; he highlighted that while the ONA recommended criminal or military activities during the 1980s and early 1990s, by the late 1990s and 2000s they were instead recommending Buddhist monasticism as an insight role for practitioners to adopt.|$|E
500|$|... "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé Knowles, Solange Knowles, Angie Beyincé and {{produced}} as well as co-written by The Bama Boyz. Jonathan Wells of Bama Boyz said that they decided to try <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> what they usually do, by mixing several genres for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". The song's inspiration came {{from the time they}} spent in London at the end of Beyoncé Knowles' The Beyoncé Experience tour in promotion of her second studio album B'Day (2006). The writing and production of the song began in London and was finished stateside in early 2008. They admitted that the song's structure was unusual, however they were happy that it ended up in the Knowles' hands. After The Bama Boyz produced two tracks on Solange Knowles' second studio album Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams (2008), she asked them to put instrumentals together for her to write for her sister Beyoncé.|$|E

Parker said they decided to cast a famous actor in the small role of Sparky because [...] "we thought it was funny", and because they wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the animated series The Simpsons, which is known for having prominent guest appearances on a regular basis. Parker added, [...] "Since South Park is sort of a show that rips on celebrity, we wanted to degrade them in other ways too. And we thought let's have celebrities on, but have them do really minor, unimportant things". Comedy Central executives were excited at the prospect of having Clooney appear on the show, but Parker said they were disappointed to learn his role was so small.|$|E

[...] Resuming work on 12 Days in early 2005, Kim felt that her [...] "slow speed, other projects and family matters" [...] delayed [...] its production. Additionally, the South Korean-native Kim, who speaks Korean, English, and Japanese fluently, would think of ideas in Korean that did not translate well over to English, ultimately leading her to change her method of thinking for the comic. She considered her creation of a global manga [...] "a bit ironic," [...] because she [...] "wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> manhwa or manga," [...] which she had grown up around. Completed in the middle of August 2006, 12 Days was published by Tokyopop in North America in November of the same year.
