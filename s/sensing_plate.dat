40|$|The earlier {{research}} shows that the electrical capacitance sensor through the tomography technique is applicable in flow visualization or image reconstruction, named as Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT). ECT can be used for imaging industrial multi-component processes involving nonconducting fluids and solids in pipelines. The electrical capacitance sensor is a non-invasive device that uses non-intrusive technique to measure the concentration of flow inside a closed pipe by measuring variations in the dielectric permittivity of the material. The capacitance of the sensor changes when the mean dielectric constant between the electrodes varies due to variations in the percentage of gas and liquid flowing in the pipe. The acquired concentration profile that obtains from capacitance measurements is able to imaging liquid and gas mixture in pipelines, meanwhile the system development is designed to attach on a vessel. The electrode plates which act as the sensor previously has been assemble fixed on the pipeline, thus it causes difficulty for the production to have any new process installation in the future.

2500|$|An {{important}} component of Keynes' theory was that the three plates from the 1794 print reprinted in 1795, formed a part of Series b, not Series a. However, if they are included with Series a (such as in Bindman's The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake), they come at the end; plates numbered I & II to refute the theories of the previous plates, followed by the 'Therefore' plate to bring the work to a close. As such, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi argue that the 1794 print represents a twelve plate abridgement (the twelve plates are a1, a2/b2, a3-9, b3-4 and b12). They argue that [...] "the b-series plates provide a brief but bold refutation of the empirical and materialist principles offered on the preceding pages and indicate the irony with which Blake offers {{the first group of}} aphorisms." [...] They especially argue that the abridgement theory is supported by plates a9 and b3, which is the cross over point from irony to refutation. Plate a9 depicts a prone figure with his head on the right, whereas plate b3 is a mirror image, a figure with his head on the left; [...] "this visual reversal complements the sudden change of philosophical perspective in the accompanying text." [...] The plates are also ideologically in direct opposition; they both deal with perceptions and organs of sense, but whereas a9 asserts that man can experience through such organs only, b3 states that this is patently false, and perceptions can go beyond organs of <b>sense.</b> <b>Plate</b> b4 elaborates on this theory, and plate b12 fulfils the prophecy of what will happen [...] "when we know more." [...] Thus the series forms a coherent, if brief, statement. As to the question of why Blake omitted the rest of the plates, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi argue that plates b6-11 deal with issues which thematically wouldn't fit into the abridgement – hence the 1794 print represents a streamlined version of the overall thesis; [...] "a statement on the empiricist theory of perception followed by its direct and forceful rebuttal." ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} novel gimbal-type {{torsional}} micromachined gyroscope with a non-resonant actuation scheme. The design concept {{is based on}} employing a 2 degrees-of-freedom (2 -DOF) drive-mode oscillator comprising a <b>sensing</b> <b>plate</b> suspended inside two gimbals. By utilizing dynamic amplification of torsional oscillations in the drive mode instead of resonance, large oscillation amplitudes of the sensing element are achieved with small actuation amplitudes, providing improved linearity and stability despite parallel-plate actuation. The device operates at resonance in the sense direction for improved sensitivity, while the drive direction amplitude is inherently constant within the same frequency band. Thus, the necessity to match drive and sense resonance modes is eliminated, leading to improved robustness against structural and thermal parameter fluctuations. In the paper, the structure, operation principle and a MEMS implementation of the design concept are presented.

In particular, the ability to measure forage throughput on a harvester would {{form the basis for}} improved management decisions and the ability to exploit precision agriculture technology, including accurate application of forage additives. The aim of this project was to develop a forage throughput sensor and to use that sensor to record yield variability and to accurately control additive application. Following preliminary trials, a force <b>sensing</b> <b>plate</b> placed in a forage harvester chute was developed and assessed. A very good relationship between sensed throughput and measured throughput was achieved, with regression coefficients of between 0. 88 and 0. 96 recorded in a series of trials. The relationship was established on a fresh-weight basis. Calibration could present difficulties in practice. The forage throughput sensor was linked to a GPS positioning system and a modified yield monitor/recording system to facilitate the measurement of yield variability in the field. Considerable difficulties were encountered with compatibility of the various components, including the analysis software. While a forage yield map was created and illustrated the levels of yield variability within a field, the need for simultaneous on-harvester dry matter sensing was apparent. A throughput-based additive application control system was designed, developed and tested. The unit performed satisfactorily, resulting in less variation in the quantity of additive applied to harvested grass compared to conventional application systems. In conclusion, there is scope for the application of precision agriculture technology, based on forage yield sensing, on grassland farms. However, there are many differences between the adoption of this technology on grassland farms compared to arable farms. In particular, yield-sensing accuracy is unlikely to be as good, and the need for simultaneous DM sensing is critical. Forage yield sensors will be commercialised soon. There will then be a need to evaluate these systems and the application of precision agriculture technology to grassland systems. End of Project Repor...|$|E

40|$|Sensors {{have become}} {{essential}} elements {{in human life}} for safe and comfortable existence in the ever demanding world. Various technologies over decades have contributed {{in their own way}} fulfilling innumerable sensing requirements. The discovery of optical sensor technologies has revolutionized the sensing field due to their inherent advantages. Among the large number of fiber optic sensor technologies, FBG based sensors have become widely known and popular within and outside the photonics community and has seen a prominent rise in their utilization. This thesis explores the use of FBG sensors {{for a wide range of}} applications scanning across a variety of engineering and medical applications, in the areas of civil engineering, biomechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, geoengineering, etc. It also deals with newer methods of packaging FBG sensors for the measurement of specific engineering parameters like strain, temperature, pressure, displacement and vibration. In the field of civil engineering, FBG sensors are employed for strain sensing on a prism and furthermore tested on a full size brick wallet. During this study, emphasis is made on substituting traditional sensors by specially packaged FBG sensors with the intent of either enhancing the sensing system’s performance or in merging/uniting the inherent advantages of FBG sensors. In the area of biomechanics, a novel sensor methodology using FBG sensors, for measuring surface strains generated on the skin of the calf muscle during various leg exercises is proposed. This methodology is used to address one of the most critical and life threatening issues in long distance air travel, namely the Deep Vein Thrombosis. Further, a FBG sensor based plantar <b>sensing</b> <b>plate,</b> is designed and developed, to measure plantar strain distribution in foot and also to analyze the postural stability. In the field of aerospace engineering, FBG sensors are used for addressing two of the most vital issues; Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and direct measurement of pressure and temperature on the surface of an aircraft under hypersonic wind flow. Carbon Fiber Composite coupon level testing is carried out to obtain a generic strain calibration factor for the FBG sensor. Further, FBG sensors are exploited for the direct measurement of absolute temperature and pressure on the leeward surface of blunt cone at hypersonic wind speeds. In the domain of geoengineering, the feasibility studies have been undertaken to use a FBG as a seismic sensor and as a bore-well characterizing sensor. A novel FBG seismic sensor package is developed using a single FBG sensor to pick up the seismic waves propagating through the ground generated from earthquakes and ground tremors. Further, FBG sensors are used for measurement of temperature profiles in a bore-well to delineate and characterize the behavior of fractures during seasonal climatic changes.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop sensory devices and data {{acquisition}} system to facilitate investigations into {{the mechanics of the}} rowing system, comprising the rower(s), boat and oars. As such, the parameters to be measured were: boat and seat position, velocity and acceleration; oar force; foot force; oar angle and rower heart rate. An oar force sensor was designed that fitted into the cavity of a modified oarlock. This sensor design is cheap, yields sound results and its presence is almost not noticeable to the rower. A review of previously applied methods of oar force measurement, predating 1900, is included. Foot force is of interest to many different fields of research, thus there is a large amount of literature on the subject of foot force measurement. A comprehensive review of this literature is used to aid {{in the design of the}} required sensor. The combination of a non-simple dynamic loading (i. e. time varying spatially distributed normal and shear forces), with static foot position distinguishes the problem of measuring the force under the feet during rowing from most previously considered cases. A strain gauge-based force <b>sensing</b> <b>plate</b> was designed to measure both normal force distribution and unidirectional shear force under the feet. Sample results are presented from a study with international class New Zealand rowers on a rowing ergometer. The sensor, performs well under normal force loadings, but needs modification to measure shear accurately. Possible modifications are suggested. While only a single oar angle, known as the sweep angle, was required to be measured, a sensor combination capable of measuring the spatial orientation of the oar relative to the boat was conceived. A new method of relative orientation estimation, via approximation of the Rodrigues' vector, which allows relative weighting of sensory data, was derived. Unfortunately, calibration issues prevented the gathering of meaningful data in the time available. A full theoretical development, including a new calibration scheme, which should alleviate the encountered problems, is included. While the motion of the rower within the boat is an important consideration in the dynamics of the rowing system, few previous researchers have measured it. These previous methods are briefly described, before the sensor used in this study, the optical rotary encoder, is detailed. Differentiation of the encoder signal to obtain seat velocity and acceleration relative to the boat was achieved using a purpose designed simple Kalman filter. The kinematic parameters of the boat, i. e. position, velocity and acceleration were measured using a combination of accelerometer and submerged impeller. The information from these two sensors was combined using a variant of the Kalman filter used in the differentiation of the encoder signal. The combination of the seat and boat kinematics allows study of the motion of the system centre of mass. Supplying power to, and collecting data from the above sensory devices was a purpose built data acquisition system dubbed ORAC (On-the-water Rowing Acquisition Computer).

40|$|High-precision {{manipulation}} of small-size objects {{is an attractive}} and challenging topic for both industrial production and fundamental scientific research. The capability of monitoring micro-samples during handling {{is essential to the}} accuracy and efficiency of a handling system for both liquid and solid samples. When handling liquid samples with small volume, tools (such as drop-on-demand inkjet dispensers and on-chip micro-fluidic channels) are often used to generate droplets or liquid segments. The typical volume ranges from nano-liters to several pico-liters, and an accurate control of the sample volume is critical in many applications. The liquid volume can be derived from the detection of the position of the liquid surface in a fluidic channel. On the other hand, when manipulating micro-scale solid objects, such as micromechanical components or living cells, with mechanical tools, a reliable and efficient handling is highly desired. In this case, the in-situ detection on the solid-solid contact between the samples and the mechanical tools, including the contact force, position and orientation, are essential for successful carrying out the high-precision manipulation. With MEMS technology, the position detection for both liquid surface and solid contact can be achieved in a similar fabrication platform. Current existing inspection tools for micro-manipulation have limited capabilities, in terms of resolution, complexity in assembly, and often rely on external equipments, such as microscopes. Their application in high-performance in-situ monitoring is thus limited. Recently, MEMS technology has been widely used to fabricate different kinds of handling tools to miniaturize the micro-manipulation system, for its small-scale, low cost and better reliability. This gives great opportunities to integrate sensing elements directly into the handling tools during the fabrication. With properly-selected sensing principles and the-state-of-the-arts fabrication technologies, compact manipulation system with integrated sensing capability can be implemented. Apart from the design and fabrication of the MEMS sensors, dedicated readout circuitry is required to achieve a good inspection. With the trend of miniaturization of MEMS devices, the level of the output signal is becoming smaller and smaller, and can often be buried in electrical noise as well as undesired signals introduced by parasitic components. In this thesis, we address the detection principles for liquid surface position and solid contact position, as well as their integration and readout issues, by presenting two MEMS approaches using the capacitive and piezoresistive principle, respectively. The first approach is a capacitive sensor integrated into an inkjet nozzle to monitor the position of the ink meniscus inside the nozzle orifice. The second one is a piezoresistive sensor, which monitors contact positions and forces between solid samples and contact surfaces of micro-manipulation tools. The two types of devices share a similar fabrication platform and readout strategy. The fabrication platform is introduced in chapter 2. A bulk micromachining process, employing both the anisotropic wet etching of silicon and the DRIE process, is chosen as a general platform (semi-SOI) to implement the proposed devices. Chapter 3 develops a readout strategy based on the lock-in principle. By modulating the signal of interest to a high-frequency band, the influence of the flicker noise in the readout circuit, which dominates the noise in the low-frequency band, is eliminated. The strategy also suppresses the influence of parasitic capacitances, which otherwise can be fatal to capacitive detection. A femto-Farad capacitive test structure is designed and fabricated. It has a capacitance of two to three orders lower than the conventional MEMS capacitor sensors (typically at pico-Farad level), allowing an experimental study of the proposed readout method for femto-Farad capacitive sensors. A minimum detectable capacitance variation as low as 1 aF, with a signal bandwidth of 100 Hz, is achieved. A capacitive sensor to monitor the position of the ink meniscus in an inkjet nozzle is presented in chapter 4, as a demonstration of liquid surface position detection. Capacitive sensors are very suitable for liquid level detections with a sub-micron resolution thanks to their low intrinsic noise, flexibility in the arrangement of electrodes and possibility to be embedded on the sidewalls of fluidic channels without influencing the liquid flow. However, to integrate vertical electrodes on the sidewall of liquid channel is a challenging task. An IC-compatible process is developed for this purpose, allowing the integration of multiple electrodes with micron-level accuracy. The capacitance of the fabricated sensor varies from 1. 5 fF (empty channel) to 13. 1 fF (channel filled with 63 pL of water), and a 60 dB resolution is achieved with a 33 kHz measurement bandwidth. The system has a capacitive sensing resolution of 0. 057 aF/Hz 1 / 2, which corresponds to a volumetric resolution of 0. 22 fL/Hz 1 / 2 and a liquid surface position resolution of 0. 17 nm/Hz 1 / 2 in a vertical channel with a diameter of 40 ?m. To investigate the principle and technique for detecting the contact position between a micro-object and the contact surface of a handling tool (such as MEMS micro-grippers), miniaturized piezoresistive MEMS sensors are integrated (chapter 5). Piezoresistive sensors are chosen for their small dimensions and straightforward readout method, which allows multiple sensing elements being integrated in a single device and being monitored at a same moment. The developed sensing principle allows an in-situ monitoring of contact conditions, including contact forces and contact positions. Based on this principle, devices have been implemented to realize different functionalities: 1) an array of five sensing plates detecting the orientation of an object and its force distribution on the plates, and 2) a 2 D <b>sensing</b> <b>plate</b> detecting a contact force and its 2 D contact position on the plate. The devices are fabricated with the “semi-SOI” platform introduced in chapter 2, and are compatible with existing micro-gripper processes developed in the DIMES lab. A basic sensing cantilever is capable of detecting a vertical contact position on its contact surface. The resolution of position detection is 3 ?m under an applied contact force of 1 mN. The resolution of the force detection is 3. 6 ?N. A sensitivity of 2. 8 V/N is obtained with an effective supply voltage of 177 mV across the Wheatstone bridge. Combining five sensing cantilevers into a sensing array, a distribution of contact forces between the object and the five adjacent contact surfaces can be monitored, thus allowing the detection of the shape of the object contact front. At the same time, the five measured vertical contact positions allow an estimation of the object position and orientation. The fabricated 2 D <b>sensing</b> <b>plate</b> detects the contact position of an applied contact force in 2 D. Taking into account the electrical noise, the theoretical spatial resolution of the plate is 5 ?m under a contact force of 1 mN, and the force resolution is 10 - 20 ?N. Although the developed devices are designed to be integrated with silicon MEMS based micro-grippers, the concept behind the devices is suitable for many other applications. The devices presented in this thesis successfully demonstrate two different approaches (capacitive and piezoresistive) for in-situ monitoring liquid and solid micro-samples during handling, based on integrated MEMS sensors. The developed principles and techniques can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of micro-handling systems. Further research needs to be carried out to investigate the performance of the fabricated devices in existing handling tools, such as inkjet printheads and micro-grippers. This raises several new challenges for future research, including assembly of the sensors on the handling tools, analysis of the detected information and implementation of closed-loop control systems.

This paper presents an easy and inexpensive implementation of such a system using four commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) infrared (IR) light emitting diode (LED) emitters and two COTS IR receivers on each of two docking plates. The angular intensity distribution of an emitter and the sensitivity distribution of a receiver allow for estimation of the angle and distance between them. Simple experiments have been conducted indicating that such a setup is able to give positional offset in any of 6 degrees of error (x, y, z, pitch, roll, and yaw) within a range. A theoretical framework is also established using least squares minimization. The theoretical framework is general and applies to other configurations of emitter and receiver parts and positioning. 1...|$|R

This paper reports {{a study on}} modeling and simulation of a CMOS-MEMS sensor for noninvasive screening of diabetes via detection of acetone vapor in exhaled breath (EB). The sensor has two structures: movable (rotor) and fixed (stator) plates. The rotor plate is suspended {{on top of the}} stator by support of four flexible beams and maintaining certain selected initial gaps of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 [*]μm to form actuation and <b>sensing</b> parallel <b>plate</b> capacitors. A chitosan polymer of varied thicknesses (1 – 20 [*]μm) is deposited on the rotor plate and modeled as a sensing element for the acetone vapor. The minimum polymer coating thickness required to detect the critical concentration (1. 8 [*]ppm) of acetone vapor in the EB of diabetic subjects is found to be 4 – 7 [*]μm, depending on the initial gap between the rotor and stator plates. However, to achieve sub-ppm detection limit to sense the acetone vapor concentration (0. 4 – 1. 1 [*]ppm) in the EB of healthy people, up to 20 [*]μm polymer thickness is coated. The mathematically modeled results were verified using the 2008 CoventorWare simulation software and a good agreement within a 5. 3 % error was found between the modeled and the simulated frequencies giving more confidence in the predicted results...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonic guided waves {{have been}} used in testing of such an {{elongated}} object as pipe. Its sensitivity and distance resolution, however, have been limited by velocity dispersion and interference of numerous propagation modes of guided waves. Trapped energy mode of vibration of thickness shear waves in a quartz plate has been widely used in frequency control and selection due to its high Q and localization. One of the authors (MO) found similar trapped modes of horizontal shear or torsional waves in a cylinder, which are suitable for inspection of pipes. The resonant frequency and Q of a trapped energy mode can be remotely measured by reflection of a propagating guided wave at its boundary. The lowest mode is preferred, because it propagates without waveform distortion due to dispersion. A part of energy in a propagating guided wave excites the trapped energy mode through mode conversion and then leaks out to the original propagating wave. This leak appears as a long-tailed ringing due to a high Q of the trapped mode. The resonant frequency and Q of a trapped energy is sensitive to changes in its vibrating region and hence can be used to <b>sense</b> changes in <b>plate</b> thickness, surface condition (roughness and corrosion) and liquid loading (density and viscosity), etc. An analysis based on a multiple transmission line model and an experimental verification of remote excitation of a trapped mode are presented...|$|R
40|$|Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) {{techniques}} {{have achieved a}} great development during the last decades as a valuable tool for material characterization, manufacturing control and structural integrity tests. Among these tools, the guided wave technology has been rapidly extended because it reduces inspection time and costs compared to the ordinary point by point testing in large structures, as well as because {{of the possibility of}} inspecting under insulation and coating conditions. This fast development has motivated the creation of several inspection and material characterization systems including different technologies which can be combined with this technique. Different measurements systems based on laser {{techniques have}} been presented in order to inspect pipes, plates and diverse structures. Many of them are experimental systems of high cost and complexity which combine the employment of a laser for generation of waves in the structure and an interferometer for detection. Some of them employ air-coupled ultrasound generation transducers, with high losses in air and which demand high energy for exciting waves in materials of high stiffness. The combined employment of a commercial vibrometer system for Lamb wave <b>sensing</b> in <b>plates</b> has been successfully shown in the literature. In this paper we present a measurement system based on the combined employment of a piezoelectric wedge transducer and a laser vibrometer to sense guided acoustic waves in carbon steel pipes. The measurement system here presented is mainly compounded of an angular wedge transducer, employed to generate the guided wave and a commercial laser vibrometer used in the detection process. The wedge transducer is excited by means of a signal function generator whose output signal has been amplified with a power signal amplifier. A high precision positioning system is employed to place the laser beam at different points through the pipe surface. The signal detected by the laser vibrometer system is amplified with a signal amplifier and then it is displayed in a digital storage oscilloscope. This set-up offers the possibility of analyzing in a simpler way the wave propagation and the material evaluation in pipes of certain wall thickness. The material characterization considering distinct wave propagation modes can be easily achieved, changing the different incident angles of the wedge piezoelectric probe and their combined employment with several driving signals. Moreover, this experimental sensing system offers other possibilities of inspecting and analyzing the wave propagation in some features (bends, flange joints, welds, [...] .) of the pipe surface which cause very large reflections and mode conversions and which in practice limits the inspection range when are inspected with conventional receiving transducer arrangements.

40|$|Mountain belts are {{inherently}} asymmetric, {{defined by the}} <b>sense</b> of <b>plate</b> subduction. The resultant orogen {{can be divided into}} peripheral and retro-arc wedges with the retro-wedge overlying the overthrust plate. Modelling suggests that retro-wedges and their neighbouring foreland basins have patterns of sedimentary architecture and sediment sourcing distinct from that of peripheral foreland basins. This study is a sedimentological and petrographical investigation into the evolution of the retro-arc wedge and foreland basin of the Hellenide/Balkan system from the Late Cretaceous to Mid-Miocene. This system is analogous in tectonic setting to the small retroforeland basins of the Apennines and Pyrenees. The east-west trending Balkans were the collisional product of the late Mesozoic/early Cenozoic Alpine Orogeny. The depocentres studied here were situated on the overthrust plate of the Eurasian-Anatolian subduction zone, north of the orogenic deformation front, the Stara Planina Frontal Thrust, and south of the stable craton, the Moesian Platform. Present day coastal exposures in Eastern Bulgaria, oriented perpendicular to the strike of the orogenic system, preserve an excellent onshore record of the transition from a tectonically inactive basin subordinate to a major back arc basin (the Late Cretaceous to End Palaeocene Emine Basin) to compressional underfilled and subsequently overfilled foreland basin (the Lower Eocene to mid-Miocene Kamchia Basin). Late Cretaceous sediment filling of the trough-like Emine Basin was in the form of deep-water turbidites (Lower Emine Formation) transported west-to-east and sourced from Cretaceous granitic basement approximately 250 km west of modern outcrops. Turbiditic deposition continued through the Palaeocene (Upper Emine Formation) but the southern basin margin began to experience compression during this time and sporadic influx of submarine fans (Kozichino Formation) sourced from the arc/incipient thrust wedge to the south of the depocentre mixed with the along-strike transported turbidites. Deposition into the Emine Basin continued to be turbiditic during the Lower Eocene (Atanas and Gebesh Formations) but there are signs of stronger basin instability and shedding of sediment off both the northern (platform) and southern (orogenic) margins from high energy deposits (Bardarevo and Meshilika Formations). The Mid-Miocene Illyrian Unconformity is a period of major tectonic compression and uplift creating structural features such as the Irakli and Obzor Synclines and mass flows sourced from recycled arc volcanics (Obzor Formation) are documented from this period. Mid and Upper Eocene deposition persisted to be easterly-transported turbidites (Dolen Chiflick Formation) but the depocentre migrated north into a shallower and geographically more restricted basin, the Kamchia Basin. The dominant control on sedimentation became increasingly eustatic rather than tectonic. By the Oligocene, sedimentation was uniformly low energy and shallow water (Ruslar Formation). The Mid-Miocene Galata Formation displays high energy, directed flow in a very narrow channel-like basin into the early Black Sea which had, by this period, begun to open through east-west extension from plate reconfiguration and orogenic collapse...|$|R
