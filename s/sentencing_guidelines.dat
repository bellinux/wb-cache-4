5|$|Scalia {{maintained}} that every element of {{an offense that}} helps determine the sentence must be either admitted by the defendant or found by a jury under the Sixth Amendment's jury guarantee. In the 2000 case of Apprendi v. New Jersey, Scalia wrote the Court's majority opinion that struck down a state statute that allowed the trial judge to increase the sentence if the judge found the offense was a hate crime. Scalia found the procedure impermissible because {{whether it was a}} hate crime had not been decided by the jury. In 2004, he wrote for the Court in Blakely v. Washington, striking down Washington state's <b>sentencing</b> <b>guidelines</b> on similar grounds. The dissenters in Blakely foresaw that Scalia would use the case to attack the federal <b>sentencing</b> <b>guidelines</b> (which he had failed to strike down in Mistretta), and they proved correct, as Scalia led a five-member majority in United States v. Booker, which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for federal judges to follow (they remained advisory).|$|E

40|$|Current and {{proposed}} <b>sentence</b> <b>guidelines</b> for drug-trafficking offences in the United Kingdom are underpinned by the neo-liberal ‘commonsense’ assumption that greater quantities will yield a greater profit, which deserves greater punishment.

Drawing on ethnographic research with drug traffickers imprisoned in Ecuador, this paper problematizes the use of weight as a measure of seriousness.

He was convicted on October 14, 1993, after a seven-week trial; {{he was given a}} sentence of five years and three months in federal prison, which was {{at the low end of}} the range prescribed by the federal <b>sentencing</b> <b>guidelines.</b> He was also fined $20,000 for a conspiracy charge that involved kickbacks disguised as political contributions. Governor Collins was called to testify in the trial, but was not charged.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine whether due process requires individualized sentencing because sentencing goals and practices have varied greatly {{during the course of this}} nation 2 ̆ 7 s history. A court applying Judge Bork 2 ̆ 7 s original intent doctrine of constitutional interpretation would probably reach a result different from that reached by a court employing a more liberal view of due process protections. 1 o It is likely that liberals and conservatives on the current Supreme Court would disagree on whether the Guidelines violate due process. This article argues that the Guidelines can be saved and can satisfy due process requirements if the Supreme Court interprets the Sentencing Reform Act to permit departures from the prescribed sentence ranges in cases in which significant mitigating circumstances are present. Such an approach would have the added benefit of providing judicial feedback on the Guidelines that will be useful in constructing better <b>sentence</b> <b>guidelines</b> in the future...|$|R
40|$|Using {{data from}} the United States Sentencing Commission (2001 - 2003), we examine the role of gender in the {{sentencing}} of defendants in federal courts. We address two questions: First, can we explain the gender gap in sentencing by taking into account differences in legal and extralegal factors? And second, do legal and extralegal factors have the same impact {{for male and female}} defendants? Overall, we find that female defendants receive more lenient sentence outcomes than their male counterparts. Legal factors account for {{a large portion of the}} gender differences, but even after controlling for legal characteristics a substantial gap in sentencing outcomes remains. Also, despite their influence on sentencing outcomes in some instances, extralegal characteristics do not help to close the gender gap. Finally, when male and female defendants are examined separately, we find that not all legal and extralegal factors weigh equally for male and female defendants.
