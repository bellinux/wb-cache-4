50|$|Propulsion was by {{two sets}} of single {{reduction}} type geared Westinghouse Parsons turbines of 5,000 <b>shaft</b> <b>horse-power</b> for each set, composed of two trubines of 2,500 hp each, {{for a total of}} 10,000 horse-power at full load that were provided with steam by eight oil fired Babcock & Wilcox water tube boilers. Maui was the first large twin screw passenger ship with geared turbines with previous single screw installations being between 2,000 and 3,000 horsepower rating. Each main propulsion unit was composed of a high and low pressure turbine and astern turbines developing 60% of the ahead power and, combined, designed for a speed of 16.5 kn at propeller speed of 125 rpm under reduced boiler pressure and 129.5 at full pressure. Total weight of propulsion machinery, located aft, was 146.32 tons.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this study has been to determine the current technology of a wind-energy conversion system (WECS) of minimal cost for rural applications. Specifically, IGT has evaluated available methods for converting <b>shaft</b> <b>horse-power</b> from a wind turbine to electricity and hydrogen. A workable mix of these two energy forms with storage that can support the energy needs of selected farming operations and the rural home was sought. Energy load patterns of several farming operations were examined for interfacing with the energy storage and delivery systems that are supplied by wind turbines dependent on the prevalent winds. Several preliminary designs have been completed so that a follow-up program for developing detailed designs and demonstration units can be implemented if desired...|$|E
