50|$|During the 1860s, {{the postal}} {{authorities}} became concerned about postage stamp reuse. While {{there is little}} evidence that this occurred frequently, many post offices had never received any canceling devices. Instead, they improvised a canceling process by scribbling on the <b>stamp</b> <b>with</b> an <b>ink</b> pen ("pen cancellation"), or whittling designs in pieces of cork, sometimes very creatively ("fancy cancels"), to mark the stamps. However, since poor-quality ink could be washed from the stamp, this method would only have been moderately successful. A number of inventors patented various ideas to attempt to solve the problem.|$|R

Moreover, various countries use UV markers to create marks on stated issued driving licenses and identity cards to ensure they are authentic.Other cases include retailers marking their items to avoid customers to exchange or return items they were not originally bought from their stores.|$|R
5000|$|One {{would imagine}} that overprints should be easier for a forger to falsify. It is just {{a simple matter of}} {{applying}} a few letters to a <b>stamp</b> <b>with</b> black <b>ink.</b> Paying attention to detail can reward a philatelic sleuth. The stamps of Bangkok from the 1880s were produced by overprinting each stamp a single letter [...] "B" [...] on stamps of the Straits Settlements. Some of these overprints are bogus because they are on underlying stamps that were never known to have been issued with that overprint. Forgeries can be discovered by examining the relative heights of the two loops of the B.|$|R

5000|$|But {{instead of}} a mind, {{universal}} literacy has given common man a rubber stamp, a rubber <b>stamp</b> <b>inked</b> <b>with</b> advertising slogans, with editorials, with published scientific data, with the trivialities of tabloids and the profundities of history, but quite innocent of original thought. Each man’s rubber stamp is the twin of millions of others, so that when these millions {{are exposed to the}} same stimuli, all receive identical imprints. … The amazing readiness with which large masses accept this process is probably accounted for by the fact that no attempt is made to convince them that black is white. Instead, their preconceived hazy ideas that a certain gray is almost black or almost white are brought into sharper focus. Their prejudices, notions, and convictions are used as a starting point, with the result that they are drawn by a thread into passionate adherence to a given mental picture.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{two kinds}} of stamps (squares (a×a)) {{separated}} by spacing b, the values of a and b were varied from 2. 5 µm to 50 µm), i. e. positive and negative stamps, were prepared. The <b>stamps</b> <b>inked</b> <b>with</b> the rhodamine-labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) were then microcontacted with the aldehyde-functionalized titanium surfaces. Water contact angle and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) indicated that BSA can be covalently immobilized on aldehyde modified titanium surface by microcontact printing. The experimental results of CLSM showed that the patterns with resolution from 2. 5 µm to 50 µm were obtained successfully. Both positive stamp and negative stamp were deformed when {{the value of a}} was {{less than or equal to}} 5 µm, which resulted in replication errors. Furthermore, the larger spacing (50 µm) resulted in stamp collapse when the value a of the positive stamp was less than or equal to 10 µm, leading to whole fluorescence on substrates. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{protocol}} {{describes a}} simple, fast, and efficient method for making adhesive micropatterns {{that can be}} used to control individual cell shape and adhesion patterns. It is based on the use of an elastomeric stamp containing microfeatures to print proteins on the substrate of choice. The process can be subdivided into three parts. First, a silicon master is fabricated, which contains the microfeatures of interest. Once fabricated, the master can be used multiple times to make <b>stamps.</b> Masters <b>with</b> customized patterns can also be purchased commercially. Second, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp is fabricated. Unlike fabrication of the master, this step can be performed without specialized equipment. The PDMS <b>stamp</b> is <b>inked</b> <b>with</b> extracellular matrix proteins. Proteins are printed on a substrate (e. g., a tissue culture polystyrene dish or a glass coverslip covered with a thin layer of polystyrene). The nonprinted areas are back-filled with poly-L-lysine-polyethylene glycol, which renders them resistant to cell adhesion. The production of these micropatterned substrates can be completed in < 2 h. The third and final portion of the protocol describes the deposition of cells onto the micropatterned substrate...|$|R

Armenian Times editor Nikol Pashinyan stressed that the opposition bloc will not give up the seven mandates and will enter parliament and continue its daily fight to change the political situation. Although, Levon Ter-Petrosyan said that who would not pick his mandate, because it's not appropriate for a former president become a MP. Later he said that bribery, repeated ballot, voter list fraud and other violations were widespread during the election. Another ANC leading member, Aram Manukyan said have evidence of violations committed by the authorities, especially of inflating voter lists, tampering <b>with</b> <b>stamps</b> and <b>ink,</b> pressure on voters and candidates’ proxies and others. He then added that they will appeal the outcome of the elections at the Constitutional Court.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second issue}} of revenue stamps were Documentary stamps and issued in 1871. After the Internal Revenue {{received}} many {{reports of the}} fraudulent re-use of revenue <b>stamps,</b> typically <b>with</b> cancellation <b>ink</b> washed or otherwise removed {{from the face of}} the stamp, [...] a letter of May 31, 1867 from government officials in Wall Street was sent to Internal Revenue commissioner E.A. Rollins expressing the concern that [...] "The U.S. government loses thousands of dollars daily by stamps being used a second time." [...] The ordinary stamps in use at this time did not receive the cancellation ink very well, unless it was heavily applied. The letter advised that all stamps be printed in a pale yellow color. This particular suggestion however was not taken up by Butler & Carpenter, but instead, after a period of experimentation, they responded to the problem by producing stamps of a lighter shade and on a paper that more readily absorbed cancellation ink. The Internal revenue was frequently sending stamps suspected of having cancellation ink washed to the engravers and printers for inspection to determine if they had been tampered with.|$|R

40|$|Different {{methods to}} create {{chemically}} patterned, flat PDMS <b>stamps</b> <b>with</b> two different chemical functionalities were compared. The best method for making such <b>stamps,</b> functionalized <b>with</b> 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (PFDTS) and 3 -(aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTS), {{appeared to be}} full functionalization of a freshly oxidized flat PDMS <b>stamp</b> <b>with</b> either adsorbate, followed by renewed oxidation through a mask and attachment of the other adsorbate. These stamps were used to transfer polar inks (a thioether-functionalized dendrimer and a fluorescent dye) by microcontact printing. The PFDTS monolayer {{was used as a}} barrier against ink transfer, while the APTS SAM areas functioned as an ink reservoir for polar inks. The printing results confirmed the excellent transfer of hydrophilic <b>inks</b> <b>with</b> these <b>stamps</b> to gold and glass substrates, even from aqueous solutions. Attachment of a fluorescent dye on the amino-functionalized regions shows the possibility of the further modification of the chemically patterned stamps for tailoring of the stamps' properties...|$|R
