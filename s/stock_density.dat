The influence of different cage litters, cage design, and <b>stock</b> <b>density</b> on measured rat urinary aeroallergen (RUA) concentrations has been examined in a room housing male rats, to determine practical means to reduce allergen concentration in animal laboratories. Eight hour static air samples were taken at 2 1 /min and the RUA concentrations measured by radioallergosorbent test (RAST) inhibition. High RUA concentrations occurred when the animals were housed on wood based, contact litter (geometric mean (GM) sawdust 7. 79 micrograms/m 3; woodchip 6. 16 micrograms/m 3). The use of noncontact absorbent pads was associated with a significant decrease in RUA concentrations (GM 2. 47 micrograms/m 3; p less than 0. 0001). Rat urinary aeroallergen concentrations fell more than fourfold when the animals were housed on woodbased, contact litter in filter top cages rather than conventional open top cages (GM filter top 0. 33 micrograms/m 3; open top 1. 43 micrograms/m 3; p less than 0. 0001). The number of rats (<b>stock</b> <b>density)</b> strongly influenced the RUA concentration and a linear relation was found between the log(e) allergen concentration and <b>stock</b> <b>density</b> under these study conditions. The measurement of airborne particle size on cleaning out days showed that all litter types generated similar sized particles: more than 80 % of the RUA was carried on particles larger than 8 microns in diameter for all litter types.

A different profile was observed for the C 18 PUFAs, mainly 18 : 2 n - 6 and 18 : 4 n - 6, which were higher in the lower <b>density</b> <b>stocking</b> group. The data suggest that when living in high <b>stocking</b> <b>density,</b> B. insignis differentially utilizes the hepatic lipids as energy source and remodels the membrane fatty acids, with higher amounts of DHA in the polar muscle fraction compensated for by a decrease in MUFA. The zootechnical and physiological indices reveal that the lower <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> group achieve overall better performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Brown trout (Salmo trutta) were sampled in Gary Creek, South Dakota, {{during the}} fall of 1988 and 1990 - 1993 using a backpack-mounted, pulsed-DC electrofishing unit. Relative {{abundance}} of stock-length (≥ 15 cm) brown trout was not significantly different among years; however. size structure increased. Brown trout proportional <b>stock</b> <b>density</b> (PSD; percentage of 15 -cm and longer fish that are also longer than 23 cm) was 50 and relative <b>stock</b> <b>density</b> or preferred-length fish (RSD-P; percentage of 15 -cm and longer fish that are also longer than 30 cm) was 4 in 1988. In 1993, PSD was 100 and RSD-P was 61. Natural reproduction of brown trout has declined over the 1988 - 1993 time period. However. the stream was annually stocked with catchable-size (20 - 23 em) brown trout. Habitat may be limiting natural reproduction and recruitment. While Gary Creek might be considered a 2 ̆ 2 quality 2 ̆ 2 brown trout population for a stocked population, the high PSD certainly reflects the lack of natural recruitment in recent years...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the effects of three different stock densities (0. 33; 0. 67 e 1. 00 fish L- 1) on freshwater angelfish productive performance reared in aquarium. Fish were fed with commercial diets during 35 days in two diary meals. The experimental design was entirely randomized and for each density were used four replicates. Were evaluated physical-chemical water parameters: temperature, oxygen dissolved concentration and total ammonia concentration and growth performance parameters: weight gain, feed conversion, specific growth rate, final standard length, conduction factor and length uniformity. Results were submitted to variance analysis and means were compared by Tukey's test (alpha = 0. 05), it was used the statistic program ESTAT 2. 0. Mortality was not observed in any tested density. on physical-chemical water parameters, total ammonia level increased significantly with <b>stock</b> <b>density</b> increasing, {{but they did not}} showed clinical signs of ammonia toxicity. As {{there were no significant differences}} between treatments, <b>stock</b> <b>density</b> 1. 00 fish L- 1 is the most indicated because it allows higher production...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} effect of <b>stock</b> <b>density</b> on the growth, survival and cannibalism of pikeperch fingerlings held under controlled conditions in a water recirculation system and fed an artificial diet. The mean body weight of the fish at the start of {{the experiment}} was 0. 65 ± 0. 11 g and the total length was 4. 54 ± 0. 28 cm. The fish were divided into three experimental groups with the following stock densities: group A- 0. 99 g l- 1; group B- 1. 65 g l- 1; group C- 2. 31 g l- 1. The rearing period was 42 days long and was divided into the adaptation and rearing proper periods. The results obtained from the experiment revealed that the initial density of pikeperch summer fry, which ranged from 0. 99 to 2. 31 g l- 1, had no effect on the final outcome of the rearing, i. e. neither on growth nor survival (ANOVA, P> 0. 05). The final mean body weights for groups A, B and C were 9. 43, 9. 25 and 8. 62 g, respectively, while total losses were 52. 5, 56. 1 and 56. 1 %, respectively. The high fingerling mortality during the adaptation period, i. e. from first to the fourteenth rearing day (group A- 40. 8 %, group B- 50. 6 %, group C- 44. 1 %), determined the effectiveness of rearing.

40|$|Commercialization of pearl culture {{requires}} {{large scale}} hatchery production of larvae. The survival of larvae depends on <b>stocking</b> <b>density,</b> environmental factors, diets and diseases. The results of experiments using 4 <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> {{at the rate}} of 100, 1000, 2000 and 3000 larvae L - 1 of filtered sea water indicated highest survival of 15. 8 and 10. 5 % in the low <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> followed by 1. 4 and 0. 34 %, respectively in other two <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> at an ambient temperature of 28. 6 ± 0. 4 °C.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in 6 earthen ponds to investigate the effects of <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> on growth, survival and production of Thai climbing perch (Anabas testudineus). Three <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> (treatments) were compared: ponds with 350, 400 and 550 individuals per decimal (0. 01 acre). All treatments were randomly assigned and in duplicate. Artificial feed containing 34 % crude protein was applied initially 20 % of total fish weight per day. Gradually the feeding rate was reduced to 15, 12, 10, 8 and 5 % of total fish weight per day. Feeding rates per pond were adjusted fortnightly after weighing minimum 20 % of the fish stocked. The duration of the {{experiment was}} 90 days. Results showed that all growth parameters were higher in ponds with lower <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> than the ponds with higher <b>stocking</b> <b>density,</b> while total fish yield was higher in ponds with higher <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> than in the ponds with lower <b>stocking</b> <b>density.</b> Cost-benefit analysis revealed that all three systems were economically profitable. However, the ponds with a <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> of 550 individuals per decimal were the most profitable system. More research is still needed to further optimize <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> of Thai climbing perch in aquaculture ponds. Until then, stocking 550 individuals of Thai climbing perch per decimal will yield a good production to fish farmers in the South and South-East Asian region...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> on feather pecking and aggressive behavior of Thai crossbred chickens was investigated from age 4 – 12  wk. In total, 900 day-old mixed sex Thai crossbred chickens {{were assigned to}} three replicates of 100 birds per pen, at <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> of 8  birds/m 2, 12 birds/m 2 and 16 birds/m 2, respectively. The frequency of feather pecking, the number of pecks per bout, pecking intensity {{and the frequency of}} aggressive behavior were recorded once a week by scanning all the birds in the pen. It was found that the <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> had no effect on the frequencies of feather pecking on body areas except on the wings area (p <  0. 05). The <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> had no effect on the occurrence of 1 – 4 pecks per bout or 5 – 9 pecks per bout. The <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> had no significant influence on the pecking, pinching or plucking intensity, except on the intensity of pulling. The different types of aggressive behavior such as stand-off, fight, threat, leap, chase, avoidance and peck were not affected by the <b>stocking</b> <b>density.</b> In conclusion, <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> did not affect the feather pecking activities and aggressive behavior of Thai crossbred chickens. However, further work is suggested with a larger number of replications to establish that there is no effect of <b>stocking</b> <b>density,</b> as the power of this study was low...|$|R
