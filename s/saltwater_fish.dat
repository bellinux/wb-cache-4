5|$|Many <b>saltwater</b> <b>fish</b> {{manufacture}} {{large amounts}} of trimethylamine oxide {{to protect them from}} the high osmotic effects of their environment; conversion of this compound to dimethylamine is responsible for the early odour in unfresh <b>saltwater</b> <b>fish.</b> In animals, free radical nitric oxide (derived from an amino acid), serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Saltwater</b> <b>fish</b> tend to lose water {{because of}} osmosis. Their kidneys return {{water to the}} body. The reverse happens in {{freshwater}} fish: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: While {{there are}} {{numerous}} studies on economic benefits of <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing,</b> there is little literature on other benefits such as social benefits. It is widely accepted that leisure, and angling are associated with social benefits, family cohesion and friendship development, yet few empirical studies exist to support these claims. Additional research that examines the relationship between recreation and leisure activities (e. g. <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing)</b> and social benefits {{is needed to determine}} if such a relationship exists. The purpose of this project is to present the findings of a study done to determine the social benefits of <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing.</b> Data was collected by interviewing fishermen along North Carolina beaches participating in surf fishing, charter boat fishing, and pier fishing. Discussion focuses on the extent that social benefits received through <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing</b> compare to other recreational activities, to what extent is involvement in saltwater angling related to social benefits received, and the relationship between participation frequency in <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing</b> and social benefits received...|$|R

5|$|Inscriptions {{from the}} eighth to the 14th centuries (during {{the rule of}} the Pandyas, Cholas and later Tenkasi Pandyas) {{indicate}} the growth of Tirunelveli as a centre of economic growth which developed around the Nellaiappar temple. The drier parts of the province also flourished during {{the rule of the}} Vijayanagara kings. From 1550 until the early modern era, migration to the city {{from other parts of the}} state was common and the urban regions became hubs of manufacturing and commerce. Tirunelveli was a strategic point, connecting the eastern and western parts of the peninsula, as well as a trading centre. Records of sea and overland trade between 1700 and 1850 indicate close trading connections with Sri Lanka and Kerala. During the 1840s, cotton produced in the region was in demand for British mills. The chief exports during British rule were cotton, jaggery, chillies, tobacco, palmyra fibre, salt, dried <b>saltwater</b> <b>fish</b> and cattle.|$|E

40|$|Georgians {{represent}} 96 {{percent of}} the recreational <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing</b> in the state. Using IMPLAN, this® studyevaluates the economic importance associated with the activity in both the coastal region and {{the state as a}} whole. Six scenarios are examined {{to determine the extent of}} economic activity. These scenarios include a base case for the coastal region, elimination of recreational <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing</b> from the coastal region and state’s economy, and a 25 percent increase in coastal and state recreational <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing</b> by the year 2005. The analysis indicates the significance of recreational <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing</b> in Georgia’s coastal and statewide economies. The 100 miles between Savannah and St. Marys do not fullydescribe the richness of Georgia’s coastline. The coastal ecosystem includes coastal marine, barrier islands, estuaries and sounds, mainland upland, rivers, and swamps that enhance the biodiversity of the region (Lenz 1999). Fourteen major barrier islands contribute to make Georgia’s coast valuable to residents and visitors. Only four islands are developed; th...|$|R

25|$|Cortisol {{promotes}} sodium absorption {{through the}} small intestine of mammals. Sodium depletion, however, does not affect cortisol levels so cortisol cannot be used to regulate serum sodium. Cortisol's original purpose may have been sodium transport.

25|$|Both {{fresh and}} <b>saltwater</b> <b>fish</b> are popular, and are served raw, grilled, broiled, dried or served in soups and stews.

Fish can also be grilled either whole or in fillets as banchan. Fish is often dried naturally to prolong storing periods and enable shipping over long distances. Fish commonly dried include yellow corvina, anchovies (myeolchi) and croaker. Dried anchovies, along with kelp, {{form the basis of}} common soup stocks.|$|E

25|$|Saltwater {{fly fishing}} {{is most often}} done from a boat, either a shallow draft flat boat is used to pursue species such as bonefish, redfish, permit and tarpon in shallow waters, or from larger {{offshore}} boats for pursuing sailfish, tuna, dorado, marlin and other pelagics and may be done from shore, such as wading flats for bonefish or redfish or surf fishing for striped bass and other assorted fish. Typically, most trout fly fisherman need to practice new skills to catch <b>saltwater</b> <b>fish</b> on a fly rod. Ocean fish are usually harder to catch. They can be extremely spooky, and much larger. Trout fisherman need to practice with at least an 8 weight fly rod and accurately cast the line 30–90 feet {{if they are going}} to have success—particularly in the flat areas fishing for bonefish, redfish, permit, tarpon, jacks and more.|$|E
25|$|The {{drip line}} or trickle acclimating method {{is a safe}} and gentle way to {{introduce}} <b>saltwater</b> <b>fish</b> into a new home, and is a fairly simple one to perform. This procedure {{can be used to}} acclimate all types of marine as well as freshwater livestock. First, the fish is placed with all the bag water in a bucket or container of sufficient size for the fish to be reasonably covered with the water, and the bucket is then set {{on the floor next to}} the aquarium. Using some plastic air line tubing and an air gang valve, a siphon drip line is set up from the aquarium to the bucket. Tank water is allowed to drip slowly into the bucket, using the gang valve to adjust the drip rate, until the water dripped into the bucket equals about two to three times the original volume of the bag water. After testing the pH, salinity, and temperature of the water in the bucket to see if these parameters match that of the tank water, the fish is gently removed and placed into the tank.|$|E
25|$|High {{levels of}} {{radioactive}} cesium {{were found in}} 23 varieties of freshwater fish sampled at five rivers and lakes in Fukushima Prefecture between December 2011 and February 2012 and in 8 locations on the open sea. On 2 July 2012 the Ministry of the Environment published that it had found radioactive cesium between 61 and 2,600 becquerels per kilogram. 2,600 becquerels were found {{in a kind of}} goby caught in Mano River, which flows from Iitate Village to the city of Minamisoma, north of the nuclear plant. Water bugs, common food for freshwater fish, also showed high levels of 330 to 670 becquerels per kilogram. Marine fish was found less contaminated and showed levels between 2.15 and 260 Bq/kg. Marine fish might be more capable of excreting cesium from their bodies, because <b>saltwater</b> <b>fish</b> have the ability to excrete salt. The Japanese Ministry of the Environment would closely monitor freshwater fish as radioactive cesium might remain for much longer periods in their bodies. According to Japanese regulations, food is considered safe for consumption up to a maximum of 100 Bq/kg.|$|E
