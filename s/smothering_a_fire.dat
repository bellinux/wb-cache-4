50|$|The burning engine fire {{depicted}} at {{the conclusion}} of the film is based on an actual World War II incident. Sgt.

40|$|The {{first use}} of, {{nitrogen}} to <b>smother</b> <b>an</b> underground <b>fire</b> {{was at the}} Doubrava mine in the Czech part of the Upper Silesian Coalfield in 1949. Since then many countries have used nitrogen for the fighting, suppression and prevention of underground fires. Experience {{of the use of}} nitrogen in Great Britain, Germany, France, the former Soviet Union states, Bulgaria, India, Poland, the Czech Republic and elsewhere is reviewed. Because the Czech Republic was the first to use pure nitrogen for the fighting of mine fires special attention is paid to this. Present-day use of nitrogen, its sources, consumption and technological equipment are discussed...|$|R
60|$|I had {{two views}} of the city--one on a gray day {{from the roof of}} a monster building, whence it seemed to {{overflow}} and fill with noises the whole vast cup of the horizon; and still, all round its edge, jets of steam and the impatient cries of machinery showed it was eating out into the Prairie like <b>a</b> <b>smothered</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|R

50|$|Three RNZAF {{pilots were}} awarded the Victoria Cross while serving with the RAF. James Allen Ward, a Sergeant Pilot with 75 Squadron, was first, when he climbed {{out onto the}} wing of his Vickers Wellington bomber to <b>smother</b> <b>an</b> engine <b>fire</b> in flight on 7 July 1941. In 1943 then Wing Commander Leonard Trent {{continued}} to lead an extremely hazardous, but vital, attack {{at the head of}} 487 Squadron until every aircraft was shot down. The same year, Flying Officer Lloyd Trigg, serving with No. 200 Squadron RAF was piloting a Consolidated Liberator bomber when it encountered a U-boat on the surface off the African coast. He attacked U-468 but as he did so, the aircraft was hit by U-boat anti-aircraft fire and burst into flames. The aircraft continued the attack and sank the U-boat but crashed shortly afterwards, with all the crew being killed. The crew's actions were reported by the U-boat's survivors, and the VIctoria Cross was awarded as a result.|$|R

Shortly before 18:30, Kaiser and her three sister ships opened fire on Nomad with their secondary batteries. The hail of 15-cm shells <b>smothered</b> the ship; <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> was started and one shell detonated the ship's forward ammunition magazine. Nomad sank stern first at 18:30. Nestor was meanwhile destroyed by the battleships of I Squadron.|$|R

It was a condescension in me to be Clym's wife, and not a manoeuvre, let me remind you; and therefore I will not be treated as a schemer whom it becomes necessary to bear with because she has crept into the family." ...|$|R
50|$|If {{water damage}} or water volume is of {{particular}} concern, a technique called Water Mist Fire Suppression may be an alternative. This technology has been under development for over 50 years. It hasn't entered general use, but is gaining some acceptance on ships {{and in a few}} residential applications. Mist suppression systems work by using the heat of the fire to 'flash' the water mist cloud to steam. This then <b>smothers</b> the <b>fire.</b> <b>As</b> such, mist systems tend to be highly effective where there is likely to be <b>a</b> free-burning hot <b>fire.</b> Where there is insufficient heat (as in <b>a</b> deep seated <b>fire</b> such as will be found in stored paper) no steam will be generated and the mist system will not extinguish the fire. Some tests have shown that the volume of water needed to extinguish <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> with such <b>a</b> system installed can be dramatically less than with a conventional sprinkler system.|$|R
