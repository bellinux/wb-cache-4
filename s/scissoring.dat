Six of these vibrations involve only the CH2 portion: symmetric and antisymmetric stretching, <b>scissoring,</b> rocking, wagging and twisting, as shown below. Structures {{that do not have}} the two additional X groups attached have fewer modes because some modes are defined by specific relationships to those other attached groups. For example, in water, the rocking, wagging, and twisting modes do not exist because these types of motions of the H represent simple rotation of the whole molecule rather than vibrations within it.|$|E

[...] Some sources, however, such as Shere Hite's 1976 and 1981 research, show that women may enjoy performing the <b>scissoring</b> position with other women because it is a variation of vulva-to-vulva contact or can allow for maximum vulva-to-vulva contact and therefore an elevated level of intimacy.|$|E

2500|$|Tribadism is {{a common}} sexual {{practice}} among women {{who have sex with}} women (WSW). Although the term tribadism is often applied to the act of vulva-to-vulva stimulation, it encompasses a variety of sexual activity. In addition to the <b>scissoring</b> position, which involves the partners interlocking their legs in a position similar to the shape of scissors and pressing their vulvas together, tribadism may involve a missionary position, a woman on top position, a doggy style position or others, or simple movement of the woman's vulva against her partner's thigh, stomach, buttocks, arm, or another body part. Vaginal penetration by use of the fingers or by use of a dildo may be accompanied, and so sometimes [...] "mutuality and reciprocation tend not to be the main objective, although satisfaction for both partners through different means most definitely is its aim". Women who enjoy or prefer tribadism report finding pleasure from its allowance of whole-body contact, the experience of timing hip movement and feeling their partner's motions without manual stimulation, which is considered exciting, erotic and a much easier way to achieve orgasm due to ample clitoral stimulation.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are other}} ways of modifying a verb or {{adjective}} {{to make it more}} intense. These are all more or less equivalent to adding the word [...] "very" [...] in English; which morphology is used depends on the word being modified. Certain words which are short in English, such as 'sad' and 'mad', are sometimes fingerspelled rather than signed to mean 'very sad' and 'very mad'. However, the concept of 'very sad' or 'very mad' can be portrayed with the use of exaggerated body movements and facial expressions. [...] Reduplication of the signs may also occur to emphasize the degree of the statement. Some signs are produced with an exaggeratedly large motion, so that they take up more sign space than normal. This may involve a back-and-forth <b>scissoring</b> motion of the arms to indicate that the sign ought to be yet larger, but that one is physically incapable of making it big enough. Many other signs are given a slow, tense production. The fact that this modulation is morphological rather than merely mimetic {{can be seen in the}} sign for 'fast': both 'very slow' and 'very fast' are signed by making the motion either unusually slowly or unusually quickly than it is in the citation forms of 'slow' and 'fast'—not exclusively by making it slower for 'very slow' and faster for 'very fast'.|$|E

40|$|In {{a dynamic}} and {{evolving}} society {{there is a}} need for temporary and mobile structures. For this, deployable <b>scissor</b> structures - structural mechanisms that can transform from a compact state to a fully deployed configuration - are suitable. However, this transformational capacity complicates the design process since there is a strong interaction between geometry, kinematic properties and structural response. In the conceptual design phase {{there is a need}} for more structural insight related to geometric aspects of deployable <b>scissor</b> structures. Toward this end, this research evaluates the influence of design parameters (height, span, structural thickness, number of units, and <b>scissor</b> type) on the structural behaviour (stress, deflection and mass) of <b>scissor</b> arches. A sensitivity analysis is first performed which determines the relative influence of each of these parameters. Then a comprehensive parametric structural study is performed to determine the best values for efficient (low mass) <b>scissor</b> systems. The result of this research is a set of guidelines to facilitate the design of competitive <b>scissor</b> structures and enhance further analysis and realisation.
