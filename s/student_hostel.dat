25|$|Poirot (and, it is {{reasonable}} to suppose, his creator) becomes increasingly bemused by the vulgarism of the up-and-coming generation's young people. In Hickory Dickory Dock, he investigates the strange goings on in a <b>student</b> <b>hostel,</b> while in Third Girl (1966) he is forced into contact with the smart set of Chelsea youths. In the growing drug and pop culture of the sixties, he proves himself once again, but has become heavily reliant on other investigators (especially the private investigator, Mr. Goby) who provide him with the clues that he can no longer gather for himself.|$|E
25|$|After {{his gold}} medal win, he ceased {{training}} in the high jump and {{did not return to}} the sport. He enrolled in a science degree at the University College of Ibadan in 1954 and became involved within the institution's student politics movement. He was {{also a member of the}} prestigious Sigma Club, University of Ibadan, a socio philanthropic student organization, organizers of the annual Havana Musical Carnival in the institution. While there he became close friends with Christopher Okigbo and J.P. Clark, both of whom would go on to become prominent Nigerian poets. Ifeajuna was also a close friend of Emeka Anyaoku, later Commonwealth Secretary-General. He was deeply involved in Ibadan's Students' Union and became the organisation's Director of Information, encouraging protests. He was affiliated with the Dynamic Party, led by mathematician Chike Obi. Uche Chukwumerije, a contemporary and later a senator, remembered Ifeajuna being active in political agitation, but also claims that he was less willing to be involved in the protests themselves. Clark also attested to this, citing the example of a protest over a <b>student</b> <b>hostel</b> shutdown. The shutdown was prompted by the manslaughter trial of Ben Obumselu, the student union president and friend of Ifeajuna. Ifeajuna organised the protests but was not present during the subsequent clashes.|$|E

2500|$|In India the dormitories {{are called}} [...] "PG housing" [...] or [...] "Student Hostels". Even {{though most of}} the colleges/universities have hostels on-campus, however in most of the cases it is not enough for the total {{students}} enrolled. Majority of the students prefer to stay off-campus in PGs and private hostels as they usually have better amenities and services. For example in 2015 estimated 1.8 lakh students enrolled with Delhi University , there are only about 9,000 seats available in its hostels for both undergraduate and postgraduate students. The university admits an average of 54,000 students every year. Which leaves a majority of students to find accommodation off-campus. This is led to a lot of <b>student</b> <b>hostel</b> or student PG chains to be established near Delhi University.|$|E
2500|$|The EMMS also {{funds the}} Ekwendeni College of Health Sciences at the University of Livingstonia. [...] The {{university}} {{is one of}} only three universities in Malawi. [...] The health sciences college has 144 student nurses who study for a diploma as a nurse/midwife technician. [...] The EMMS has provided textbooks and funded a student hardship fund. [...] These funds have been crucial as the cost to educate, feed, and house students is $2000 per year, while the student can only fund individually about $800 on average. [...] The devaluation of the country’s currency, the Malawi kwacha, makes it more likely that students will be in financial need for sponsorship. [...] With the EMMS’s contributions, the college was able to construct a male <b>student</b> <b>hostel</b> and become the first college in Malawi to train male nurses.|$|E
