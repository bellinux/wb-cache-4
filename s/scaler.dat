25|$|Unlike {{analytics}} products {{offered by}} SAS Institute, R does not natively handle datasets larger than main memory. In 2010 Revolution Analytics introduced <b>ScaleR,</b> a package for Revolution R Enterprise {{designed to handle}} big data through a high-performance disk-based data store called XDF (not related to IBM's Extensible Data Format) and high performance computing across large clusters. The release of <b>ScaleR</b> marked a push away from consulting and services alone to custom code and a la carte package pricing. <b>ScaleR</b> also works with Apache Hadoop and other distributed file systems and Revolution Analytics has partnered with IBM to further integrate Hadoop into Revolution R. Packages to integrate Hadoop and MapReduce into open source R {{can also be found}} on the community package repository, CRAN.|$|E
25|$|The AGC had a power-saving mode {{controlled}} by a standby allowed switch. This mode turned off the AGC power, except for the 2.048MHz clock and the <b>scaler.</b> The F17 signal from the <b>scaler</b> turned the AGC power and the AGC back on at 1.28 second intervals. In this mode, the AGC performed essential functions, checked the standby allowed switch, and, if still enabled, turned off the power {{and went back to}} sleep until the next F17 signal.|$|E

50|$|Sonic and {{ultrasonic}} <b>scalers</b> are {{powered by}} a system that causes the tip to vibrate. Sonic <b>scalers</b> are {{powered by a}}n air-driven turbine. Ultrasonic <b>scalers</b> use either magnetostrictive or piezoelectric systems to create vibration. Magnetostrictive <b>scalers</b> use a stack of metal plates bonded to the tool tip. The stack is induced to vibrate by an external coil connected to an AC source. Ultrasonic <b>scalers</b> also include a liquid output or lavage, which aids in cooling the tool during use, as well as rinsing all the unwanted materials from the teeth and gum line. The lavage {{can also be used}} to deliver antimicrobial agents.|$|R

25|$|The master {{frequency}} {{was further}} divided through a <b>scaler,</b> first by five using a ring counter {{to produce a}} 102.4kHz signal. This was then divided by two through 17 successive stages called F1 (51.2kHz) through F17 (0.78125Hz). The F10 stage (100Hz) was fed back into the AGC to increment the real-time clock and other involuntary counters using Pinc (discussed below). The F17 stage was used to intermittently run the AGC when it was operating in the standby mode.|$|E
25|$|Input lag, {{because the}} LCD's A/D {{converter}} waits for each frame {{to be completely}} been output before drawing it to the LCD panel. Many LCD monitors do post-processing before displaying the image {{in an attempt to}} compensate for poor color fidelity, which adds an additional lag. Further, a video <b>scaler</b> must be used when displaying non-native resolutions, which adds yet more time lag. Scaling and post processing are usually done in a single chip on modern monitors, but each function that chip performs adds some delay. Some displays have a video gaming mode which disables all or most processing to reduce perceivable input lag.|$|E

40|$|It {{is crucial}} that the {{instrument}} used for maintenance be able to remove plaque and calculus from the implant surface effec-tively and efficiently, while causing minimal damage to its circumference. Some ultrasonic <b>scalers</b> may be useful for implant maintenance; however, no clinical study has exam-ined this. This study evaluated the treatment of titanium im-plants with three piezoelectric <b>scalers</b> in vivo. Methods: Fourteen patients underwent implant treatment in which plaque and calculus {{were removed from the}} abut-ment surfaces with ultrasonic <b>scalers.</b> The abutments were treated with <b>scalers</b> with carbon (VS; N = 7), plastic (PS; N = 7), or metallic (ES; N = 7) tips. The abutment surface charac-teristics were examined after instrumentation using scanning electron microscopy. The amount of plaque remaining and roughness were estimated using a modification of the remain-ing plaque and calculus score and the modified roughness score, respectively. In addition, the abutment surfaces were imaged with a laser profilometer and a laser scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results: The remaining plaque and calculus scores did not differ significantly among the VS, PS, and ES groups. VS and PS produced a significantly smoother abutment surface than ES. The laser SEM three-dimensional images also demon-strated that VS and PS produced smooth abutment surfaces, whereas ES resulted in damaged surfaces. Conclusions: VS and PS produced clean, smooth abutment surfaces. Piezoelectric <b>scalers</b> with non-metal tips are suitable for use in dental implant maintenance. J Periodontol 2007; 78...|$|R

These fights were followed by bouts against Billy Farrell in Moose Jaw, Ray Campbell and Young Jack O'Brien in Vancouver and then Martin Murphy in Fernie, British Columbia. In early July Welsh broke off his Canadian tour to watch Ritchie's return to the ring. It was an unimpressive display over 'Mexican' Joe Rivers, saved only by a knockout in the eleventh. During this period, to insure his name stayed in the papers, Welsh revealed that he and Fanny Weston had actually been married since 1905, a secret kept from all but the closest family members.

500|$|The men who removed {{this rock}} were called [...] "high scalers". While {{suspended}} {{from the top of}} the canyon with ropes, the high-scalers climbed down the canyon walls and removed the loose rock with jackhammers and dynamite. Falling objects were the most common cause of death on the dam site; the high scalers' work thus helped ensure worker safety. One high <b>scaler</b> was able to save life in a more direct manner: when a government inspector lost his grip on a safety line and began tumbling down a slope towards almost certain death, a high <b>scaler</b> was able to intercept him and pull him into the air. The construction site had, even then, become a magnet for tourists; the high scalers were prime attractions and showed off for the watchers. The high scalers received considerable media attention, with one worker dubbed the [...] "Human Pendulum" [...] for swinging co-workers (and, at other times, cases of dynamite) across the canyon. To protect themselves against falling objects, some high scalers took cloth hats and dipped them in tar, allowing them to harden. When workers wearing such headgear were struck hard enough to inflict broken jaws, they sustained no skull damage, Six Companies ordered thousands of what initially were called [...] "hard boiled hats" [...] (later [...] "hard hats") and strongly encouraged their use.|$|E

2500|$|While {{attending}} Reed, Snyder did folklore {{research on}} the Warm Springs Indian Reservation in central Oregon. He graduated with a dual degree in anthropology and literature in 1951. Snyder's senior thesis, entitled The Dimensions of a Myth, employed perspectives from anthropology, folklore, psychology, and literature to examine a myth of the Pacific Northwest's Haida people. He spent the following few summers working as a timber <b>scaler</b> at Warm Springs, developing relationships with its people that were less rooted in academia. This experience {{formed the basis for}} some of his earliest published poems (including [...] "A Berry Feast"), later collected in the book The Back Country. [...] He also encountered the basic ideas of Buddhism and, through its arts, some of the Far East's traditional attitudes toward nature. He went to Indiana University with a graduate fellowship to study anthropology. (Snyder also began practicing self-taught Zen meditation.) He left after a single semester to return to San Francisco and to 'sink or swim as a poet'. Snyder worked for two summers in the North Cascades in Washington as a fire lookout, on Crater Mountain in 1952 and Sourdough Mountain in 1953 (both locations on the upper Skagit River). His attempts to get another lookout stint in 1954 (at the peak of McCarthyism), however, failed. He had been barred from working for the government, due to his association with the Marine Cooks and Stewards. [...] Instead, he went back to Warm Springs to work in logging as a chokersetter (fastening cables to logs). This experience contributed to his Myths and Texts and the essay Ancient Forests of the Far West.|$|E
