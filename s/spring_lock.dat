500|$|The main {{antagonist}} of {{the series}} is [...] "Purple Guy", who is presumably a former Fazbear Entertainment employee who murdered at least five children, whose spirits now inhabit the animatronics. In mini-games from the second game, he murders a child, whose spirit is largely believed to inhabit the Puppet. In the third game, it is revealed that he returned to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza after it closed down to dismantle the animatronics. This released {{the spirits of the}} children he murdered, scaring him into hiding inside a <b>spring</b> <b>lock</b> suit, where he was crushed to death by the suit's faulty internal workings. It is believed that his body resides in Five Nights at Freddy's 3s main antagonist, Springtrap. In the [...] adaptation {{of the series}}, Purple Guy receives a possible identity, with the name William Afton. It was also revealed that he was the co-owner of Fazbear Entertainment. Scott Cawthon has stated that although [...] "the book is canon, just as the games arehat doesn't mean that they are intended to fit together like two puzzle pieces". Most of the gaming community accepts it as Purple Guy's true name and work. A certain [...] "Mr. Afton", mentioned in Sister Location's prologue, is thought to be Purple Guy, creating the possibility of him being the creator of the animatronics seen in game.|$|E

50|$|A dead bolt, {{deadbolt}} or {{dead lock}} is a locking mechanism distinct from a <b>spring</b> bolt <b>lock</b> because a deadbolt cannot {{be moved to}} the open position except by rotating the lock cylinder with the key. The more common <b>spring</b> bolt <b>lock</b> uses a <b>spring</b> to hold the bolt in place, allowing retraction by applying force to the bolt itself. A deadbolt can therefore make a door more resistant to entry without the correct key.|$|R

As a truck, the Day was able to carry up to 1000 lb in a 36 in by 96 in cargo space.

60|$|They are {{wonderful}} places, these great Venetian houses, palaces, and fortresses, and prisons all in one. I was led along a passage {{and down a}} bare stone stair until {{we came to a}} short corridor from which three doors opened. Through one of these I was thrust and the <b>spring</b> <b>lock</b> closed behind me. The only light came dimly through a small grating which opened on the passage.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time I began to realise fully what I had done in coming to this place at such an hour. Some wild {{thoughts}} of a tardy retreat flashed into my mind, and I tried {{the handle of the}} door by which we had entered. It turned, but the door remained closed. I stooped down and examined it. The result was as I had feared--a <b>spring</b> <b>lock</b> had fastened it. I tried the other door, by which my guide had issued. The result was the same. I was a prisoner.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{speaking}} to himself, {{he led her}} into an old-fashioned parlour, {{shut the door behind}} them, and fastened it with a bolt. While Jeanie, surprised at this manoeuvre, remained as near the door as possible, the Laird quitted her hand, and pressed upon a <b>spring</b> <b>lock</b> fixed in an oak panel in the wainscot, which instantly slipped aside. An iron strong-box was discovered in a recess of the wall; he opened this also, and pulling out two or three drawers, showed that they were filled with leathern bags full of gold and silver coin.|$|E
50|$|Jason runs off, {{intending}} {{to be rescued}} by Carlton, and Charlie, John, Lamar, Jessica and Marla who break into the restaurant to find him. Finding Carlton, Charlie undoes the <b>spring</b> <b>locks</b> and frees him from the costume. As they search for a way out, the four robots come to life and pursue them through the restaurant. William reveals that the robots are possessed by the vengeful ghosts of his victims, and boasts that they will hunt down and kill any intruders. The group tries to hide in a party room, but all four robots corner them. However, they are halted {{by the arrival of}} a fifth robot, the yellow Freddy from Fredbear's Family Diner, which Charlie realizes is possessed by Michael's ghost. It was then that they realized the animatronics were trying to defend them from William Afton. The yellow Freddy grants them permission to leave, and Chief Burke arrives to search for the missing Officer Dunn. William attacks in the yellow Bonnie costume, but Charlie activates its <b>spring</b> <b>locks,</b> killing him. As the robots drag William's corpse away, Chief Burke escorts everyone out of the mall. The friends go their separate ways the next morning, and before leaving Hurricane, Charlie visits her father's grave, remembering a happy day she had with him when she was a child.|$|R

50|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{gameplay}} in Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location does {{away with}} the survival aspect of previous games. Instead of remaining {{in one place and}} preventing the animatronic antagonists from attacking, the player must move from room to room in order to fulfill a series of objectives that change during each of the five nights. For example, Night 2 requires the player to sneak across Ballora Gallery and reset a group of circuit breakers, while for Night 4, the player is placed inside a springlock suit and must keep its <b>spring</b> <b>locks</b> wound up while shaking off the animatronic dolls (Minireenas) that climb onto it.|$|R
6000|$|The {{two younger}} monks got up quickly, passed before the visitors, crossed a {{whitewashed}} anteroom, unlocked a solid door, then sprung {{it back in}} the face of oncoming Isabel. But despite the haste of a fleeing order she had {{caught a glimpse of the}} sacred garden beyond, and it did not occur to her disqualified judgment to regard herself as a natural temptation for carnal thoughts. She simply smiled at the rude opportunity enjoined by holiness. As she followed the [...] "brother" [...] in charge of the regulation tour for strangers, she kept wondering about the tall, handsome monk who had used a pass key on the <b>spring</b> <b>lock</b> of the oaken door.|$|E
6000|$|... "While I stood stupefied {{with horror}} by this ghastly {{spectacle}} and still holding open the door, by some unaccountable perversity my attention was diverted from the shocking scene and concerned itself with trifles and details. Perhaps my mind, with an instinct of self-preservation, sought relief in matters which would relax its dangerous tension. Among other things, I {{observed that the}} door that I was holding open was of heavy iron plates, riveted. Equidistant from one another and from the top and bottom, three strong bolts protruded from the beveled edge. I turned the knob and they were retracted flush with the edge; released it, and they shot out. It was a <b>spring</b> <b>lock.</b> On the inside there was no knob, nor any kind of projection--a smooth surface of iron.|$|E
60|$|At once I renewed my work {{upon the}} planks, {{and within a}} very few minutes I had {{loosened}} them {{in such a way}} that I could remove and replace them at pleasure. Passing through the aperture I found myself in the farther cell, which, as I expected, was the other half of the one in which I had been confined. I was not any nearer to escape than I had been before, for there was no other wooden wall which I could penetrate and the <b>spring</b> <b>lock</b> of the door had been closed. There were no traces to show who was my companion in misfortune. Closing the two loose planks behind me I returned to my own cell and waited there with all the courage which I could command for the summons which would probably be my death knell.|$|E

60|$|Tracing {{the course}} of events afterwards, I {{conclude}} that I must have been insensible for about two hours. What roused me to consciousness once more was that sharp metallic click which had been the precursor of my terrible experience. It was the shooting back of the <b>spring</b> <b>lock.</b> Then, before my senses were clear enough to entirely apprehend what they saw, I was aware of the round, benevolent face of my cousin peering in through the open door. What he saw evidently amazed him. There was the cat crouching on the floor. I was stretched upon my back in my shirt-sleeves within the cage, my trousers torn to ribbons and a great pool of blood all round me. I can see his amazed face now, with the morning sunlight upon it. He peered at me, and peered again. Then he closed the door behind him, and advanced to the cage to see if I were really dead.|$|E

60|$|I {{tried the}} walls, and I tried the floor, and I tried the ceiling, but though I tapped and probed, they all {{appeared}} to be very thick and solid. The door was of iron, shutting with a <b>spring</b> <b>lock,</b> and provided with a small grating, through which a warder looked twice in every night. Within there were two beds, two stools, two washstands--nothing more. It was enough for my wants, for when had I had as much during those twelve years spent in camps? But how was I to get out? Night after night I thought of my five hundred hussars, and had dreadful nightmares, in which I fancied that the whole regiment needed shoeing, or that my horses were all bloated with green fodder, or that they were foundered from bogland, or that six squadrons were clubbed {{in the presence of}} the Emperor. Then I would awake in a cold sweat, and set to work picking and tapping at the walls once more; for I knew very well that there is no difficulty which cannot be overcome by a ready brain and a pair of cunning hands.|$|E
