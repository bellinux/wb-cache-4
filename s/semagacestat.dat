50|$|There are {{different}} approaches. One {{approach is to}} reduce amyloid beta, for example with bapineuzumab, an antibody in phase III studies for patients in mild to moderate stage; <b>semagacestat,</b> a γ-secretase inhibitor, MPC-7869; and acc-001 or CAD106, vaccines against amyloid beta. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, like AL-108 (phase II completed); or metal-protein interaction attenuation, {{as is the case}} of PBT2 (phase II completed). Yet another approach is to use general cognitive enhancers, as may be the case for memantine, a pharmaceutical approved in the United States and European Union to treat moderate-to-severe AD. A recent (March 2015) physical approach utilizes ultrasound for penetrating the blood-brain barrier and activating microglial cells, in experimental animals; researchers reported in Science that the essay eliminates a great proportion of amyloid beta and restores memory function.

40|$|Neurological and {{psychiatric}} disorders are frequently associated with disruption of various cognitive functions, but development of effective drug treatments for these conditions has proven challenging. One {{of the main}} obstacles is the poor predictive validity of our preclinical animal models. In the present {{study the effects of}} the γ-secretase inhibitor <b>semagacestat</b> was evaluated in preclinical in vivo electrophysiological models. Recently disclosed Phase III findings on <b>semagacestat</b> indicated that Alzheimer’s disease patients on this drug showed significantly worsened cognitive function compared to those treated with placebo. Since previous studies have shown that drugs impairing cognitive function (including scopolamine, NMDA receptor antagonists and nociceptin receptor agonists) disrupt or decrease power of elicited theta oscillation in the hippocampus, we tested the effects of acute and sub-chronic administration of <b>semagacestat</b> in this assay. Field potentials were recorded across the hippocampal formation with NeuroNexus multi-site silicon probes in urethane anaesthetized male C 57 BL/ 6 mice; hippocampal CA 1 theta oscillation was elicited by electrical stimulation of the brainstem nucleus pontis oralis. Sub-chronic administration of <b>semagacestat</b> twice daily over 12 days at a dose known to reduce beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) level (100 mg/kg, p. o.) diminished power of elicited hippocampal theta oscillation. Acute, subcutaneous administration of <b>semagacestat</b> (100 mg/kg) produced a similar effect on hippocampal activity. We propose that the disruptive effect of <b>semagacestat</b> on hippocampal function {{could be one of the}} contributing mechanisms to its worsening of cognition in patients with Alzheimer disease.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{negative}} efficacy study {{examining the}} γ-secretase inhibitor <b>semagacestat</b> in {{mild to moderate}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) included a number of biomarkers of the disease as well as safety outcomes. We analyzed these data to explore relationships between drug exposure and pharmacodynamic effects and to examine the correlations among outcome measures. METHODS: The study was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of two dose regimens of <b>semagacestat</b> and a placebo administered for 18 months to individuals with mild to moderate AD. Changes in measures of central and peripheral drug activity were compared between the three treatment groups using one-way analysis of variance. The relationship between changes {{in each of the}} outcome measures and measures of drug exposure and peripheral pharmacodynamic effect were assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Assignment to the active treatment arms was associated with reduction in plasma amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, increase in ventricular volume, decrease in cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and several other laboratory measures and adverse event categories. Within the active arms, exposure to drug, as indicated by area under the concentration curve (AUC) of blood concentration, was associated with reduction in plasma Aβ peptides and a subset of laboratory changes and adverse event rates. Ventricular volume increase, right hippocampal volume loss and gastrointestinal symptoms were related to change in plasma Aβ peptide but not AUC, supporting a link to inhibition of γ-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein. Cognitive decline correlated with ventricular expansion and reduction in p-tau. CONCLUSION: These findings may inform future studies of drugs targeting secretases involved in Aβ generation...|$|E

40|$|Drugs {{currently}} {{used for the}} treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) produce limited clinical benefits, and there is no disease-modifying therapy yet available. Compounds that inhibit or modulate γ-secretase, the pivotal enzyme that generates β-amyloid (Aβ), are potential therapeutics for AD. This article briefly reviews the profile of γ-secretase inhibitors and modulators that have reached the clinic. Studies in both transgenic and non-transgenic animal models of AD have indicated that γ-secretase inhibitors, administered by the oral route, are able to lower brain Aβ concentrations. However, scanty data are available on the effects of these compounds on brain Aβ deposition after prolonged administration. γ-Secretase inhibitors may cause abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract, thymus, spleen, skin, and decrease in lymphocytes and alterations in hair color in experimental animals and in man, effects believed {{to be associated with the}} inhibition of the cleavage of Notch, a transmembrane receptor involved in regulating cell-fate decisions. Unfortunately, two large Phase III clinical trials of <b>semagacestat</b> in mild-to-moderate AD patients were prematurely interrupted because of the observation of a detrimental cognitive and functional effect of the drug. These detrimental effects were mainly ascribed to the inhibition of the processing of an unknown substrate of γ-secretase. It has been also hypothesized that the detrimental cognitive effects observed after <b>semagacestat</b> administration are due to the accumulation of the neurotoxic precursor of Aβ (the carboxy-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein, APP, or CTFβ) resulting from the block of the γ-secretase cleavage activity on APP. Some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other small organic molecules have been found to modulate γ-secretase shifting its cleavage activity from longer to shorter Aβ species without affecting Notch cleavage. However, two large Phase III studies in mild AD patients with tarenflurbil, a putative γ-secretase modulator, were also completely negative. The failure of tarenflurbil was ascribed to low potency and brain penetration. New more selective γ-secretase inhibitors and more potent, more brain penetrant γ-secretase modulators are being developed with the hope of overcoming the previous setbacks. Further understanding of the reasons of the failures of these γ-secretase-based drugs in AD may be important for the future research on effective treatments for this devastating disease...|$|E

40|$|First-in-human {{clinical}} trials represent a critical juncture in {{the translation of}} laboratory discoveries. However, because they involve the greatest degree of uncertainty {{at any point in}} the drug development process, their initiation is beset by a series of nettlesome ethical questions [1]: has clinical promise been sufficiently demonstrated in animals? Should trial access be restricted to patients with refractory disease? Should trials be viewed as therapeutic? Have researchers adequately minimized risks?

40|$|Abstract Background: The {{temporal}} relationship of cognitive deficit and functional impairment in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{is not well}} characterized. Recent analyses suggest cognitive decline predicts subsequent functional decline throughout AD progression. Objective: To better {{understand the relationship between}} cognitive and functional decline in mild AD using autoregressive cross-lagged (ARCL) panel analyses in several clinical trials. Methods: Data included placebo patients with mild AD pooled from two multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3 solanezumab (EXPEDITION/ 2) or <b>semagacestat</b> (IDENTITY/ 2) studies, and from AD patients participating in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cognitive and functional outcomes were assessed using AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living instrumental subscale (ADCS-iADL), or Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), respectively. ARCL panel analyses evaluated relationships between cognitive and functional impairment over time. Results: In EXPEDITION, ARCL panel analyses demonstrated cognitive scores significantly predicted future functional impairment at 5 of 6 time points, while functional scores predicted subsequent cognitive scores in only 1 of 6 time points. Data from IDENTITY and ADNI programs yielded consistent results whereby cognition predicted subsequent function, but not vice-versa. Conclusions: Analyses from three databases indicated cognitive decline precedes and predicts subsequent functional decline in mild AD dementia, consistent with previously proposed hypotheses, and corroborate recent publications using similar methodologies. Cognitive impairment may be used as a predictor of future functional impairment in mild AD dementia and can be considered a critical target for prevention strategies to limit future functional decline in the dementia process...|$|E
40|$|Since we fi rst {{reported}} the reduced incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) among subjects using statins, many other epidemiological studies have repeated this fi nding [1 - 11], {{and only one}} study has failed to observe this eff ect [3]. However, epidemiology is meant to generate hypotheses but does not prove effi cacy. Th e critical test comes with prospective clinical trials. Th e fi rst major prospective clinical trial of a statin, the Lipitor’s Eff ect in Alzheimer Dementia (LEADe) study of atorvastatin, gave the fi rst sign that the data suggested from epidemiological studies do not translate to prospective clinical trials [12]. Next, a trial run by Sano and colleagues [13] presented further results, this time with simvastatin, for lack of protection against the progression of cognitive decline among subjects with AD. Th e results from the study by Sano and colleagues show a strikingly null eff ect; the placebo and treatment groups are practically identical.

40|$|International audienceOligomeric amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide {{contributes}} to impaired synaptic connections and neurodegenerative processes, and as such, represents a primary therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD) -modifying approaches. However, {{the lack of}} efficacy of drugs that inhibit production of A beta demonstrates {{the need for a}} better characterization of its toxic effects, both on synaptic and neuronal function. Here, we used conditioned medium obtained from recombinant HEK-A beta PP cells expressing the human amyloid-beta protein precursor (A beta-CM), to investigate A beta-induced neurotoxic and synaptotoxic effects. Characterization of A beta-CM revealed that it contained picomolar amounts of cell-secreted A beta in its soluble form. Incubation of primary cortical neurons with A beta-CM led to significant decreases in synaptic protein levels as compared to controls. This effect was no longer observed in neurons incubated with conditioned medium obtained from HEK-A beta PP cells grown in presence of the B-secretase inhibitor, <b>Semagacestat</b> or LY 450139 (LY-CM). However, neurotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects of A beta-CM were only partially prevented using LY-CM, which could be explained by other deleterious compounds related to chronic oxidative stress that were released by HEK-A beta PP cells. Indeed, full neuroprotection was observed in cells exposed to LY-CM by additional treatment with the antioxidant resveratrol, or with the pluripotent n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid. Inhibition of A beta production appeared necessary but insufficient to prevent neurodegenerative effects associated with AD due to other neurotoxic compounds that could exert additional deleterious effects on neuronal function and survival. Therefore, association of various types of protective agents needs to be considered when developing strategies for AD treatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Accumulation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in the plaques {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{pathological}} features in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE- 1) and γ-secretase results in the formation of Aβ peptides. Preventing Aβ formation is believed to attenuate AD progression and BACE- 1 and γ-secretase are thus attractive targets for AD drug development. Methods Combining BACE- 1 and γ-secretase inhibition on Aβ secretion from human neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cells was evaluated in this study. Secreted Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 levels were measured from SH-SY 5 Y cells stably transfected with APPwt or APPswe genes. A selective BACE inhibitor and the γ-secretase inhibitor LY 450139 (<b>semagacestat)</b> were used to inhibit respective secretase. Results LY 450139 increased Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 secretion from SH-SY 5 Y APPwt cells at low concentrations (by 60 % at 3 nM) followed by subsequent inhibition at higher concentrations (IC 50 90 nM). Washout studies showed that the Aβ increase evoked by 3 nM LY 450139 was not due to enhanced cleavage following substrate accumulation but rather to activation of Aβ formation. By contrast, LY 450139 inhibited Aβ formation from SH-SY 5 Y APPswe in a monophasic manner (IC 50 18 nM). The BACE inhibitor per se inhibited Aβ secretion from both SH-SY 5 Y APPwt and SH-SY 5 Y APPswe cells with IC 50 s ranging between 7 - 18 nM and also prevented the increased Aβ secretion evoked by 3 nM LY 450139. Combining the BACE inhibitor with higher inhibitory concentrations of LY 450139 failed to demonstrate any clear additive or synergistic effects. Conclusion BACE- 1 inhibition attenuates the Aβ increase evoked by LY 450139 while not providing any obvious synergistic effects on LY 450139 -mediated inhibition. </p...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{is associated with}} considerable costs and has {{a significant impact on}} health and social care systems. Objective This study assessed whether baseline comor-bidities present in 2, 594 patients with AD participating in two <b>semagacestat</b> randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) would significantly impact overall costs. Methods Resource utilization was captured using the Resource Utilization in Dementia Scale-Lite. Comorbidi-ties and concomitant medications were tabulated via patient and caregiver reports. Only baseline data were analyzed. Direct and indirect costs per month were calcu-lated per patient. The relationship between cost and explanatory variables was explored in a regression model. Results The baseline monthly cost of care in this RCT population was £ 1, 147 ± 2, 483, with informal care costs accounting for 75 % of costs. Gender, age, and functional status were significant predictors of costs (p B 0. 0001). The cost ratio was not impacted when the number of comorbidities was added to the model (cost ratio = 0. 95; 95 % CI 0. 91 – 0. 99) or when combined with the number of concomitant medications (cost ratio = 0. 97; 95 % CI 0. 95 – 1. 00). Inconsistent findings related to the impact of individual comorbidities on costs were noted in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions The number of comorbidities, alone or when combined with concomitant medications, did not impact baseline costs of care, perhaps because RCTs often enroll less severely ill and more medically stable patients. How-ever, higher costs were consistently associated with greater functional impairment similar to non-RCT databases. Supplemental sources (e. g., claims databases) are likely needed to better estimate the effects of disease and treat-ment on costs of illness captured in RCTs for AD...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A {{mutation}} in the BRI 2 /ITM 2 b gene causes familial Danish dementia (FDD). BRI 2 is an inhibitor of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) processing, which is genetically linked to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. The FDD mutation {{leads to a}} loss of BRI 2 protein and to increased APP processing. APP haplodeficiency and inhibition of APP cleavage by β-secretase rescue synaptic/memory deficits of a genetically congruous mouse model of FDD (FDD KI). β-cleavage of APP yields the β-carboxyl-terminal (β-CTF) and the amino-terminal-soluble APPβ (sAPPβ) fragments. γ-secretase processing of β-CTF generates Aβ, which is considered the main cause of AD. However, inhibiting Aβ production did not rescue the deficits of FDD KI mice, suggesting that sAPPβ/β-CTF, and not Aβ, are the toxic species causing memory loss. Results Here, we have further analyzed the effect of γ-secretase inhibition. We show that treatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) results in a worsening of the memory deficits of FDD KI mice. This deleterious effect on memory correlates with increased levels of the β/α-CTFs APP fragments in synaptic fractions isolated from hippocampi of FDD KI mice, which is consistent with inhibition of γ-secretase activity. Conclusion This harmful effect of the GSI is in sharp contrast with a pathogenic role for Aβ, and suggests that the worsening of memory deficits may be due to accumulation of synaptic-toxic β/α-CTFs caused by GSI treatment. However, γ-secretase cleaves more than 40 proteins; thus, the noxious effect of GSI on memory may be dependent on inhibition of cleavage of {{one or more of these}} other γ-secretase substrates. These two possibilities do not need to be mutually exclusive. Our results are consistent with the outcome of a clinical trial with the GSI <b>Semagacestat,</b> which caused a worsening of cognition, and advise against targeting γ-secretase in the therapy of AD. Overall, the data also indicate that FDD KI is a valuable mouse model to study AD pathogenesis and predict the clinical outcome of therapeutic agents for AD. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeAlthough {{diabetes}} {{is recognized as}} {{a risk factor for}} the development of cognitive impairment and for accelerated progression to Alzheimer disease (AD), it is unclear whether patients with diabetes who have already progressed to AD have a different rate of cognitive and functional decline compared with that in those without diabetes. This post hoc exploratory analysis compared cognitive and functional decline over an 18 -month period in patients with mild AD dementia with and without comorbid diabetes. Decline in quality of life was assessed as a secondary objective. MethodsIn a post hoc exploratory analysis, we analyzed data from the placebo groups of three 18 -month, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of solanezumab and <b>semagacestat</b> in patients with AD. Data from patients with mild AD dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score, 20 – 26) and comorbid diabetes at baseline were compared with data from patients with mild AD dementia without diabetes at baseline. Cognition was assessed using the 14 -item AD Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog 14) and the MMSE. Functioning was assessed with the AD Cooperative Study–Activities of Daily Living Inventory (instrumental subset) (ADCS-iADL). Quality of life was assessed using the European Quality of Life– 5 Dimensions scale, proxy version (proxy utility score and visual analog scale score), and the Quality of Life in AD scale, self-report and proxy (caregiver) versions. Group comparisons of changes from baseline to 18 months in cognitive, functional, and quality-of-life measures employed a repeated-measures model adjusted for propensity score, study, baseline cognition score (functional or quality of life), age, sex, level of education, genotype of the apolipoprotein E gene, and concurrent use of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine. FindingsAt baseline, patients with mild AD dementia with and without diabetes did not significantly differ on the cognitive measures, but those without diabetes were functioning at a significantly higher level. At 18 months, compared with patients without diabetes, those with diabetes showed a numerically but statistically nonsignificantly lesser cognitive decline (least squares mean between-group differences: ADAS-Cog 14 score, 1. 61 [P = 0. 21]; MMSE score, – 0. 40 [P = 0. 49]) and a statistically significantly lesser functional decline (least squares mean between-group difference in ADCS-iADL score, – 3. 07; P = 0. 01). The 2 groups did not differ on declines in the quality-of-life measures. ImplicationsThe present findings suggest that diabetes may influence the rate of functional decline among patients with mild AD dementia. These results require replication in studies that address the limitations of the present post hoc exploratory analysis and that explore the potential causes of the observed differences...|$|E
