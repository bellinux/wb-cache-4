5000|$|The ARQ-M {{characters}} are remapped to a seven bit {{system so that}} there are always three bits on and four bits off. The ARQ code is a Moore code, which can detect the modification of any single bit. This alphabet is CCITT Telegraph Alphabet No. 3 aka TOR No. 3. This differs from the alphabet used in the ARQ-E single channel system. [...] Three additional control signals are added to the 32 from the Baudot set. Out of 128 seven bit characters there are 35 that have three one bits set, so allowing for the 32 Baudot and three control codes to just be accommodated. The extra control {{characters are}} RQ, meaning request repeat, α meaning constant space condition, which may indicate the end of a connection (break signal) or be used to signal information, such as a number to connect to, and the β character, meaning constant mark condition, used when there is nothing to send. The RQ signal is also called <b>Signal</b> <b>Roman</b> <b>one</b> and may be designated [...] "I".|$|E
2500|$|A 4th-century <b>Roman</b> <b>signal</b> station, <b>one</b> {{of several}} on the Yorkshire coast, {{was built on}} the {{headland}} at the cliff top. The station was to warn of approaching hostile vessels, and took advantage of a natural source of fresh water which became known as the [...] "Well of Our Lady". The remains of the signal tower were excavated in the 1920s revealing it to be square in plan around a small courtyard. It measured about 33 metres across and was built of wood on stone foundations with a gatehouse and an outer ditch.|$|R
50|$|On the king's <b>signal,</b> <b>Romans</b> began abducting {{the young}} women in {{attendance}} much to the shock and horror of their guests. Later, the women are brought before him where he assures them {{that he and the}} other men of Rome intend to honorably marry them and that they won't be sexually exploited in any way. This eases their fears.|$|R

50|$|However, {{the church}} would start {{worrying}} soon about the proliferation of liturgies. From the mixture of the galican liturgy with the antique <b>Roman</b> <b>one</b> would result, traditionally under pope Gregory I (540-604), the modern Roman liturgy, also known as Gregorian liturgy, comprising the Gregorian chant. This would become the official liturgy of the Catholic Church and substituted gradually the local ones. In the Iberian Peninsula, the Council of Burgos decreed the substitution of the Hispanic rite by the modern <b>Roman</b> <b>one</b> in 1080. This measure was eased by the fact that, during the Reconquista, most part of the bishops were French (Gérard, Maurice Bourdin, Jean Péculier, Bernard, Hughes).|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Burrington Ham" [...] was {{commonly}} {{used for the}} hill fort before the 20th century. At that time, the camp was sometimes {{thought to be a}} <b>Roman</b> <b>one</b> and was also associated with the Druids.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, due to {{the works}} for the {{construction}} of the Lungotevere, the two Roman ramps which linked the bridge with the two banks were destroyed, and on their place two arches similar to the <b>Roman</b> <b>ones</b> were built.|$|R
50|$|The {{classical}} puteal wellheads {{are made}} of carved stone, often marble in Europe.

60|$|Then {{one day he}} {{fell into}} a great peril. He came to the old road (a <b>Roman</b> <b>one,</b> I presume; for the Teutons, whether in England or elsewhere, never dreamed of making roads till three hundred years ago, but used the old <b>Roman</b> <b>ones),</b> which led out of the Thuringen land to Maintz. And at the ford over the Fulda he met a great {{multitude}} bathing, of Sclavonian heathens, going to the fair at Maintz. And they smelt so strong, the foul miscreants, that Sturmi's donkey backed, and refused to face them; and Sturmi himself was much of the donkey's mind, for they began to mock him (possibly he nearly went over the donkey's head), and went about to hurt him.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the turn}} of the 20th century, four churches had been established—two Lutheran, <b>one</b> <b>Roman</b> Catholic, and <b>one</b> Congregational.|$|R
50|$|In European typefaces, {{especially}} <b>Roman</b> <b>ones,</b> a slope or slanted {{style is}} used to emphasise important words. This is called italic type or oblique type. These designs normally slant to the right in left-to-right scripts. Oblique styles are often called italic, but differ from 'true italic' styles.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{suggested}} that since Venus had a Greek name, {{as well as}} a <b>Roman</b> <b>one,</b> this should be used; however, the adjectival form of Aphrodite was [...] "aphrodisial", which again was felt to be unfortunately close to [...] "aphrodisiac", again evoking matters not directly pertaining to astronomy.|$|R
50|$|The monarch {{replaced}} the Mozarabic or Toledan rite for the <b>Roman</b> <b>one.</b> In this respect it {{is a common}} legend that Alfonso VI took Mozarabic and Roman breviaries and threw them into the fire. When only the Roman breviary burned, the king threw the Mozarabic one into the fire, imposing thus the Roman rite.|$|R

30|$|In the Greek idea of {{democracy}} and the <b>Roman</b> <b>one</b> of res publica the concepts of polity, politics and policy tend to converge in the idea itself of city: it is the city that simultaneously represents the place, purpose and practices through which the democratic regime can produce its best fruit (valid decisions for everyone) for the community.|$|R
50|$|The Ambrosian Rite {{during the}} centuries {{has lost its}} ancient variety, even if it {{maintains}} a richness of choices for the Preface and its first Eucharistic Prayer is slightly different form the <b>Roman</b> <b>one</b> mainly in the Words of Institution. Recently two typical additional ancient Eucharistic Prayers have been restored, to be used mainly on Easter and Holy Thursday.|$|R
50|$|The Tarot Nouveau was {{designed}} by C.L. Wüst of Frankfurt in the mid-19th century. It is popular in Francophone Europe and Quebec and is also used in Denmark to play tarot games that require the full 78-card deck.
