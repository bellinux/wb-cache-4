5000|$|After retiring, Ford {{admitted}} in interviews to having occasionally doctored baseballs. Examples were the [...] "mudball", used {{at home in}} Yankee Stadium. Yankee groundskeepers would wet down an area near the catcher's box where the Yankee catcher Elston Howard was positioned; pretending to lose balance, Howard would put down his hand with the ball and coat {{one side of the}} ball with mud and throw it to Ford. Ford sometimes used the diamond in his wedding ring to gouge the ball, but he was eventually caught by an umpire and warned to stop. Howard sharpened a buckle on his <b>shinguard</b> and used it to scuff the ball.|$|R

50|$|Aside {{from his}} prowess as a fighter, Schmidt was {{also known for}} other {{displays}} of his physical toughness. As a catcher, Schmidt never wore <b>shinguards.</b> He could force nails into the floor with his bare fists.

Schmidt's career was shortened due to numerous fractures sustained over the years of his thumb and fingers.|$|E
50|$|Modern codified savage {{provides}} for {{three levels of}} competition: assault, pre-combat and combat. Assault requires the competitors to focus on their technique while still making contact; referees assign penalties {{for the use of}} excessive force. Pre-combat allows for full-strength fighting so long as the fighters wear protective gear such as helmets and <b>shinguards.</b> Combat, the most intense level, is the same as pre-combat, but protective gear other than groin protection and mouthguards is prohibited.|$|E
50|$|In both men's and women's lacrosse, goalkeepers are {{required}} to wear a helmet and 4-point chinstrap, a throat protector, gloves, and a chest protector. Use of a protective cup is, for obvious reasons, required in the men's game; thigh pads and <b>shinguards</b> are also being required for women goalkeepers as of 2007. Although they are permitted to, few goalkeepers elect to wear optional protective equipment, including elbow and shoulder pads, thigh pads and shin guards, and long sweat pants.|$|E
50|$|The new gates allow a {{more direct}} path down a slalom course {{through the process of}} {{cross-blocking}} or shinning the gates. Cross-blocking is a technique in which the legs go around the gate with the upper body inclined toward, or even across, the gate; in this case the racer's outside pole and <b>shinguards</b> hit the gate, knocking it down and out of the way. Cross-blocking is done by pushing the gate down with the arms, hands, or shins.|$|E

50|$|Australian rules {{football}} is a sport {{known for its}} high level of physical body contact compared to other sports such as soccer and basketball. High impact collisions can occur from any direction, although deliberate collisions from front-on (known specifically as a shirtfront when the contact is body-on-body). In addition, players typically wear no protective padding of any kind except for a mouthguard (unlike the full-body gear in gridiron football codes or the <b>shinguards</b> in soccer). As such, injury rates tend to be high.|$|E

50|$|In UWFI, {{he adopted}} the name Yuhi Sano. Adopting the <b>shinguards</b> and trunks typical of shoot style wrestlers, Sano had more {{opportunities}} to face actual heavyweights. Nevertheless, during the 1995-96 feud against NJPW, Sano participated on UWFI's side, beating old rival Liger one more time but losing to Shinya Hashimoto. In the feud against the WAR promotion, which had been born out of the ashes of SWS, Sano lost to old patron Genichiro Tenryu in a singles match. Upon UWFI's collapse later in December 1996, Sano joined its successor promotion, Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|Roger Bresnahan, often {{regarded}} as the game's best catcher of the 1900s, and described by both McGraw and Branch Rickey as the greatest catcher they had ever seen; in 1907 {{he became the first}} major league catcher to wear <b>shinguards,</b> and was a capable player at every position. He was fast enough to bat leadoff, and remains the only catcher to steal over 200 bases in his career. He managed the Cardinals and Cubs for a total of five seasons, and was later a coach with the Giants and Tigers.|$|E
50|$|Motte {{was born}} in Port Huron, Michigan, but {{attended}} Valley Central High School, Montgomery, New York, in 2000 where he played catcher. Valley Central is also the alma matter of former MLB pitcher Matt Morris. He then attended Iona College in New Rochelle, New York. At Iona, Motte could throw to second base from behind the plate as fast as 1.76 seconds, and was clocked at throwing 85 mph from this position. While Motte never pitched for Iona, the school's pitching coach reported that, with <b>shinguards</b> on, Motte once released a 94 mph pitch from the mound at practice.|$|E

5000|$|Many female players use [...] "sliding shorts", {{otherwise}} known as compression shorts in other sports. These shorts help to protect the upper thigh when sliding into a base. [...] "Sliders" [...] may also be worn for similar protection. These are somewhat padded <b>shinguards</b> that extend usually from the ankle to the knee of the wearer and wrap {{all the way around}} the leg(s). They protect the shin, calf, etc. from getting bruised or damaged while sliding into homeplate and make it much more comfortable to slide into the plate. Most male players use long, baseball-style pants. However, some female players now wear a shorter version of baseball pants.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Kanemaru {{underwent}} a transformation. His simple Bermuda shorts and boots were changed for tights and <b>shinguards,</b> {{and he began}} executing more high-risk maneuvers proper for a junior heavyweight. This paid off well for Kanemaru, as he plowed through a field of unlikely but talented competitors to win a tournament for the first-ever GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship. He {{would go on to}} win the title twice more, including a win over NJPW's long time junior ace, Jushin Thunder Liger. In tag teams his experience widened as well, teaming with Tsuyoshi Kikuchi to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, and with Takashi Sugiura to win the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship twice. His win of the NJPW title served as a catalyst for the creation of the equivalent Noah title.|$|E
50|$|The Arnis Philippines {{system uses}} foam-padded sticks {{about an inch}} in {{diameter}} with thin rattan cores roughly a centimeter in diameter. These sticks are meant to break before serious injury occurs. For protection, the same headgear used in the WEKAF system, and a large groin guard is required for males. Vests (optional for men, required for women), optional armguards, <b>shinguards</b> and leg wraps are used. Scoring is more similar to fencing where fighters are separated after solid clean hits are made (observed by multiple judges stationed at different positions to observe if hits were clean and unblocked, and determine {{the strength of the}} strike by the loudness of the impact). Alternative ways to score are to disarm one's opponent or to force him to step outside the ring.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, {{he joined}} Pro Wrestling Noah. He became Takuma Sano, {{for a year}} wearing tights and wrestling junior heavyweights, but after fully turning heavyweight, he {{returned}} to the <b>shinguards</b> and trunks. As part of the faction led by Akira Taue and also composed of Daisuke Ikeda, Sano had opportunities for the GHC Heavyweight Championship held by Kenta Kobashi and later, Mitsuharu Misawa, but failed both times. In 2010, he teamed with Yoshihiro Takayama to win the Global Tag League. On September 18, 2010, Sano and Takayama defeated Akitoshi Saito and Bison Smith to win the vacant GHC Tag Team Championship. They would lose the title to New Japan Pro Wrestling's Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson on June 18, 2011, at Dominion 6.18 in a match contested also for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. After his contract with NOAH expired in January 2012, Sano became a freelancer.|$|E
50|$|Suneate (literally shin guards) are {{a type of}} armored shin {{protection}} worn by the samurai {{class and}} their retainers during the feudal era of Japan. Suneate first started {{being used in the}} 12th century. The suneate most commonly consisted of vertical armor plates of iron or leather connected by either hinges or chain armor (kusari), suneate could also be made almost entirely of chainmail. The plates were usually attached to a cloth backing which had cloth straps that were used to tie the suneate to the lower leg. There is usually a leather guard abumi-zure attached to the inner side of the place that will come into contact with the stirrup when riding. The more ancient examples of these <b>shinguards</b> are seen as plates, often with rather large knee guards attached. When worn the abumi-zure of the suneate will be placed toward the inner side of the leg.|$|E
40|$|Wear {{appropriate}} {{safety equipment}} • Wear shock absorbent, anatomically shaped <b>shinguards</b> during informal {{play as well}} as competition. • Seek professional advice for correct fitting of shin guards and footwear. • Wear external ankle supports (taping or a semirigid orthosis) to decrease inversion and eversion. • Wear mouthguards to prevent dental injury. Modify rules for children • Encourage children to play Rooball, with modified field and ball size, fewer players and shorter playing periods, {{as a means of}} developing good skills and technique and reducing injuries. Other safety tips • Coaches should educate players that foul play is not acceptable. • Encourage players to drink adequate water before and during play. • Encourage use of a broad spectrum sunscreen in high UV conditions and discourage play in extreme weather conditions, particularly extreme heat and humidity. • Cooldown adequately after play or training If an injury occurs • Require the players to leave the field immediately. • Ensure all injured soccer players receive adequate treatment and full rehabilitation before they resume play...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Football {{is officially}} {{the most popular}} sport in the world. In the UK, 10 % of the adult {{population}} play football at least once a year. Despite this, there are few papers in the literature on tibial diaphyseal fractures in this sporting group. In addition, conflicting views on the nature of this injury exist. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to compare our experience of tibial shaft football fractures with the little available literature and identify any similarities and differences. Methods and Results A retrospective study of all tibial football fractures that presented to a teaching hospital was undertaken over a 5 year period from 1997 to 2001. There were 244 tibial fractures treated. 24 (9. 8 %) of these were football related. All patients were male with a mean age of 23 years (range 15 to 29) and shin guards were worn in 95. 8 % of cases. 11 / 24 (45. 8 %) were treated conservatively, 11 / 24 (45. 8 %) by Grosse Kemp intramedullary nail and 2 / 24 (8. 3 %) with plating. A difference in union times was noted, conservative 19 weeks compared to operative group 23. 9 weeks (p Conclusion Our series compared similarly with the few reports available in the literature. However, a striking finding noted by the authors was a drop in the incidence of tibial shaft football fractures. It is likely that this is a reflection of recent compulsory FIFA regulations on <b>shinguards</b> as well as improvements in the design over the past decade since its introduction. </p...|$|E
