5|$|A {{population}} bottleneck is when {{a population}} contracts to a <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller</b> size over {{a short period of}} time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the odds for survival of any member of the population are purely random, and are not improved by any particular inherent genetic advantage. The bottleneck can result in radical changes in allele frequencies, completely independent of selection.|$|E
5|$|Even though peasant {{households}} were <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller</b> than aristocratic ones, {{the wealthiest}} of these would also employ servants. Service {{was a natural}} part of the cycle of life, and it was common for young people to spend some years away from home in the service of another household. This way they would learn the skills needed later in life, {{and at the same time}} earn a wage. This was particularly useful for girls, who could put the earnings towards their dowry.|$|E
50|$|This {{technique}} utilizes {{a similar}} approach when compared to ball indentation only on a <b>significantly</b> <b>small</b> scale. The tip is lowered into the sample and a laser reflecting off the cantilever allows for precise measurements to be obtained.|$|R
25|$|Multifocal motor {{neuropathy}} (MMN) {{is a rare}} clinical case, characterized {{almost entirely}} by muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations. An important feature of MMN is that the strength-duration constant is <b>significantly</b> <b>small,</b> corresponding to an appreciable increase in rheobase. Both measurements {{have been shown to}} become normalized following intravenous immunoglobulin therapy.|$|R
50|$|Breeding occurs readily in captivity. Females {{will lay}} around 300 eggs, which will hatch within 96 hours (a {{few hours after}} the lights are turned off). The eggs and larvae, due to their <b>significantly</b> <b>small</b> size, are {{difficult}} to rear. In addition, brittle stars, serpent stars, wrasses, and crabs will eat damselfish eggs.|$|R
5|$|Mala Prespa and Golo Brdo is a {{small area}} in {{the west of the}} Macedonia region in Albania, mainly around Lake Ohrid. It {{includes}} parts of the Korçë, Pogradec and Devoll districts. These districts in whole occupy about , but the area concerned is <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller.</b> Gora (part of the municipality of Dragaš) and Prohor Pčinjski are minor parts in the north of the Macedonia region in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|The Hôtel d'Alluye is a hôtel particulier in Blois, Loir-et-Cher, France. Built for Florimond Robertet {{when he was}} {{secretary}} and notary to Louis XII, the residence bears {{the name of his}} barony of Alluyes. On Rue Saint-Honoré near Blois Cathedral and the Château de Blois, it is now <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller</b> than it was originally as the north and west wings were destroyed between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system {{comprising}} the Sun and the objects that orbit it, {{either directly or}} indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller</b> objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.|$|E

CXorf64 is the blue column shown in the middle.|$|R
3000|$|Wireless {{channels}} {{have high}} error rates due to multipath fading which characterizes mobile radio channels. However, many networks {{require that the}} error rates should be <b>significantly</b> <b>small.</b> In addition to the poor channel quality, the design of wireless communication systems {{is complicated by the}} rapidly changing quality of the radio channel [33].

5|$|The {{station is}} {{illuminated}} by two-tierd bronze chandeliers, each featuring 12 distinct lighting groups holding candle-like bulbs. The chandeliers, designed by Stanislav Adamenko and Mariya Ralko, were installed between the mosaic stripes. Both the station halls and the underground vestibule feature similar light fixtures, {{although they are}} <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller</b> than the main chandeliers. The redesign also called for a gold smalt-covered ceiling, although this was rejected as it was too expensive. To finish it off, gray granite was used on the floor.|$|E
5|$|Three other, <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller,</b> nuthatches have ranges which overlap that of white-breasted, {{but none}} has white plumage {{completely}} surrounding the eye. Further distinctions {{are that the}} red-breasted nuthatch has a black eye line and reddish underparts, and the brown-headed and pygmy nuthatches each have a brown cap, and a white patch on the nape of the neck.|$|E
5|$|Cannon also {{transformed}} naval warfare: the Royal Navy, in particular, {{took advantage}} of their firepower. As rifling became more commonplace, the accuracy of cannon was significantly improved, and they became deadlier than ever, especially to infantry. In World War I, a considerable majority of all deaths were caused by cannon; they were also used widely in World War II. Most modern cannon {{are similar to those}} used in the Second World War, including autocannon—with the exception of naval guns, which are now <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller</b> in caliber.|$|E

5|$|Egypt {{and much}} of Palestine were {{controlled}} by the Arab Shi'ite Fatimid Caliphate, which was <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller</b> since {{the arrival of the}} Seljuqs. Warfare between the Fatimids and Seljuqs caused great disruption for the local Christians and for western pilgrims. The Fatimids, under the nominal rule of caliph al-Musta'li but actually controlled by vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuqs in 1073 (although some older accounts say 1076); they recaptured it in 1098 from the Artuqids, a smaller Turkish tribe associated with the Seljuqs, just before the arrival of the crusaders.|$|E
5|$|The cheetah {{is often}} {{confused}} with the leopard and the cougar and can be distinguished by its small round spots {{in contrast to the}} leopard's rosettes and the cougar's plain coat; in addition, the leopard lacks the tear streaks of the cheetah. The cougar possesses neither the tear streaks nor the spotted coat pattern of the cheetah. The serval has a form very {{similar to that of the}} cheetah but is <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller.</b> Moreover, it has a shorter tail and spots that fuse to form stripes on the back.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its large}} size, the overall {{appearance}} of Deinosuchus was not considerably {{different from that}} of modern crocodilians. Deinosuchus had an alligator-like, broad snout, with a slightly bulbous tip. Each premaxilla contained four teeth, with the pair nearest to the tip of the snout being <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller</b> than the other two. Each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bone in the upper jaw) contained 21 or 22teeth. The tooth count for each dentary (tooth-bearing bone in the lower jaw) was at least 22. All the teeth were very thick and robust; those close {{to the rear of the}} jaws were short, rounded, and blunt. They appear to have been adapted for crushing, rather than piercing. When the mouth was closed, only the fourth tooth of the lower jaw would have been visible.|$|E
30|$|There {{are other}} regions with {{statistically}} significant values found in southern Hokkaido, Izu island, Noto peninsula, and Kii peninsula. In southern Hokkaido, the spectral ratios are <b>significantly</b> <b>small,</b> which {{is different from}} other regions. Hokkaido is located close to the null-axis directions of source mechanisms of the Tohoku-Oki and the reference earthquakes (Fig. 3). Then, the spectral ratios {{are very sensitive to}} slight differences of the mechanisms, which causes the variation of the spectral ratios.|$|R

5|$|Elements {{that show}} tripositive ions with {{electronic}} configuration of a noble gas (scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, actinium) show a clear trend in their physical properties, such as hardness. At the same time, if group 3 is continued with lutetium and lawrencium, several trends are broken. For example, scandium and yttrium are both soft metals. Lanthanum is soft as well; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite {{far from the}} nucleus compared to the nuclei charges. Due to the lanthanide contraction, lutetium, the last in the lanthanide series, has a <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller</b> atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge, thus making the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding more difficult, and thus making the metal harder. However, lutetium suits the previous elements better in several other properties, such as melting and boiling points. Very {{little is known about}} lawrencium, and none of its physical properties have been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Gymnopilus flavus, despite also {{appearing}} on land near the Mediterranean, can be differentiated from G.maritimus as it lives among grass, especially Dactylis glomerata, {{and it has}} distinctly smaller spores, typically measuring 5 to 6 by 3.5 to 4.2μm. G.pseudofulgens, also collected in Italy, shows two major morphological differences: it produces smaller mushrooms, and spores that are of a different shape with smaller warts. G.decipiens, another species that grows on sandy soil, again has spores that are markedly different. The American species G. arenicola also favours sandy soil, but has <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller</b> spores than G.maritimus. Two other species of Gymnopilus found around the Mediterranean are G.corsicus and G.spadiceus. G.corsicus has no veil remnants on the stem, and spores that do not turn red in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's iodine, and so can easily be differentiated from G.maritimus. G.spadiceus shows several similarities to G.maritimus, but grows only on pine wood and has rectangular spores.|$|E
5|$|His {{mother was}} {{supportive}} of his comic endeavours and would often drive him to stand-up gigs at the comedy club Yuk Yuks. With his deadpan humour, {{he won the}} Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest at 16 years old. Also when Rogen was 16, his father lost his job and his mother quit hers, forcing them to put their house up for sale and relocate to a <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller</b> apartment. Around this time, he landed a role on Judd Apatow's television show Freaks and Geeks after attending a local casting call. Despite a strong academic performance, Rogen {{dropped out of high}} school, began working for Apatow, and relocated with his family to Los Angeles.

50|$|Compared with {{behavioral}} procedures, ERPs provide a continuous measure of processing between a stimulus and a response, {{making it possible}} to determine which stage(s) are being affected by a specific experimental manipulation. Another advantage over behavioral measures is that they can provide a measure of processing of stimuli even when there is no behavioral change. However, because of the <b>significantly</b> <b>small</b> size of an ERP, it usually takes a large number of trials to accurately measure it correctly.|$|R
5|$|McCarty {{split time}} with Arkee Whitlock in 2009. He rushed for {{two touchdowns in}} Week 4, being named the Canadian Player of the Week for the third time. He was also named the Canadian Player of the Month in July after {{continuing}} to play {{a large role in}} the rushing game. In August, McCarty injured his hamstring in a game against the Stampeders and missed several games. He briefly returned in mid-September before being sidelined again with recurring hamstring issues until late October. In Week 19, McCarty ran for 81 yards and a touchdown off of 10 carries, helping the Eskimos defeat the BC Lions in a 45–13 blowout. Despite having his season sidetracked by injuries, McCarty finished 2009 with 348 rushing yards and five touchdowns on 67 attempts, as well as seven special-teams tackles. He saw a <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller</b> role as a receiver, catching 20 passes for only 124 yards.|$|E
5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller</b> amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E
5|$|The guns used three {{different}} charges, {{depending on the}} situation: a full charge, a full flashless charge, and a reduced charge. The standard full charge weighed 15.2–15.5lb (6.9–7.0kg), the flashless charge was slightly heavier at 16lb (7.3kg), and the reduced charge was <b>significantly</b> <b>smaller,</b> at 3.6lb (1.6kg). Both full charges provided a muzzle velocity of 2,600ft/s (790m/s) in new guns, but as continued fire wore down the barrels, muzzle velocity degraded slightly, to 2,500ft/s (760m/s). The reduced charge's muzzle velocity was correspondingly lower, at 1,200ft/s (370m/s). Each gun was supplied with 450 rounds, and was expected to fire 4,600 shells before it was worn enough to warrant replacement. At the maximum effective elevation to engage surface targets, 45degrees, the guns could hit targets up to 17,392yards (15,903m) away. The maximum height at which aircraft could be engaged was 37,200feet (11,900m).|$|E
