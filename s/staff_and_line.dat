"The British {{did have}} staff {{officers}} {{as far back}} as the Crimean War working in these three cells but staff work was looked at with great disdain in the British Army and only became acceptable after the terrible hardships of the Crimean war, brought on by disorganization" [...] The General Staff in Britain was formed in 1905, and reorganized again in 1908. Unlike the Prussian staff system, the British Army was thought too small to support separate staff and command career streams. Officers would typically alternate between staff and command. Beevor, Inside the British Army, says instead that the terrible cleavages between <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> units caused by the enormous losses during the trench warfare of the First World War meant that senior British officers decided that from thenceforth all officers would rotate between <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> responsibilities, preventing the development of a separate general staff corps.|$|E

5000|$|In May 1917 Young {{appealed to}} Theodore Roosevelt for {{support of his}} {{application}} for reinstatement. Roosevelt was then {{in the midst of}} his campaign to form a [...] "volunteer division" [...] for early service in France in World War I. Roosevelt appears to have planned to recruit at least one and perhaps two black regiments for the division, something he had not told President Wilson or Secretary of War Baker. He immediately wrote to Young offering him command of one of the prospective regiments, saying [...] "there is not another man yourself who would be better fitted to command such a regiment." [...] Roosevelt also promised Young carte blanche in appointing <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> officers for the unit. However, Wilson refused Roosevelt permission to organize his volunteer division.|$|E
5000|$|In his {{correspondence}} with President Wilson and the Secretary of War, Roosevelt {{did not mention}} {{the fact that he was}} planning to recruit at least one regiment, and perhaps a brigade (two regiments) of African-American troops for the division. He discussed plans for raising and equipping such a unit with F. S. Stover, a wealthy Philadelphia businessman who was raising funds for the proposed division. In May, 1917, while he waited for Wilson’s response to his proposal, he offered command of the regiment (or the brigade, if one were formed) to Lieutenant Colonel Charles Young, the senior African-American officer in the Regular Army, a friend and associate of W.E.B. DuBois, and author of a systematic study of the cultural bases of military power, The Military Morale of Races and Nations (1912). Roosevelt had known Young since 1901, had great respect for his talents, and in 1904 had appointed him to the newly formed Military Intelligence Division of the General Staff. On May 8, 1917 Young had written to ask Roosevelt's help in opposing the Army's effort to force his retirement for supposed medical reasons. In fact, the army wanted to avoid having to give Young the kind of active-service appointment his rank and experience entitled him to, because the army wished to avoid any situation in which White officers might have to take orders from a senior Black officer. Roosevelt's response was to offer him command of the proposed regiment or brigade: “there is not another man yourself who would be better fitted to command such a regiment.” He also promised Young [...] "carte blanche" [...] in appointing <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> officers for the unit. He then wrote to Stover, telling him to “communicate with Lieutenant Colonel Young, the colored United States Officer, a thoroughly fine fellow. It seems to me he should command your regiment if it is raised. I would love to have regiment with me if the President lets me go.” On May 30, Young thanked Stover for giving him the opportunity to command “a regiment of my own people,” and added: “I know men of high character and efficiency who could make good in these positions and do honor to themselves, their race, country, and to yourself Stover as the Organizer of the regiment.” All these plans came to nothing when Wilson refused Roosevelt permission to organize his volunteer division. Young was retired for medical reasons during the war, then reappointed to active duty after it was over. Nevertheless, the proposal indicates a change in Roosevelt's racial attitudes, perhaps influenced by the persuasive scientific and sociological arguments of Young's book.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose is}} to analyse the impact of team {{responsibility}} (the division of job regulation tasks between team leader and team members) on team performance. It bases an analysis on 36 case studies in The Netherlands which {{are known to have}} implemented team-based work. The case studies were executed in 1997 by means of face-to-face interviews with HRM <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> management. It concludes from the analyses that two different types of team responsibility prevail. In a “hierarchical team” team leaders take responsibility for decisions concerning work preparation, support and control, while in the “shared-responsibility team” decisions are taken by the team members themselves. The analyses show that “shared-responsibility teams” are thought to contribute more substantially to team performance outcomes than “hierarchical teams”. The analysis helped {{gain a better understanding of}} the relationship between HRM and organisation performance, as it is viewed in the “human resource-based view of the firm”...|$|E
50|$|Attaingnant's major {{contribution}} to music printing consists in his popularizing the single-impression method for music printing, which he first employed in his 1528 publication Chansons nouvelles en musique à quatre parties. In this system, the individual notes were printed directly onto segments of <b>staff,</b> <b>and</b> so the notes, <b>staff</b> <b>lines,</b> <b>and</b> text {{could all be}} printed with one send through the printing press. The main disadvantage of this method was the alignment of the staff lines, which often had a “bumpy” look—-some being slightly higher or slightly disjointed from others. Nevertheless, this method became standard music printing practice across Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries.|$|R

40|$|Scheduling is a {{combinatorial}} {{problem with}} important impact on both industry and commerce. If it is performed well it yields time and efficiency benefits and hence reduces costs. Genetic Algorithms {{have been applied}} to solve several types of scheduling problems; Flow Shop, Resource, <b>Staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>Line</b> Balancing have all been tackled. However Jobshop Scheduling {{is the most common}} problem of interest. The Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) involves placing jobs onto a set of machines with the aim of minimising makespan, the total time to complete all jobs. The standard JSP model is relatively simple and cannot cope with many real world situations. This paper outlines a new method, using an operation based construction, which expands the JSP to increase its functionality and applicability.

40|$|The {{current study}} focused on job {{satisfaction}} and job performance, {{as well as on}} their predictors in a privatized organization. We tested a model in which job satisfaction, consistent with social cognitive theory, is related to self-efficacy and perceptions of social context (i. e., colleagues, immediate supervisor, top management); job satisfaction, in turn, predicts job performance along with organizational tenure. White collars (N= 1172) from the <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> functions of an Italian privatized organization were administered a self-report questionnaire matched with their job performance as rated by supervisors (six months later). Structural equation modelling supported the hypothesized relationships among variables. We found that: (a) self-efficacy was related to the three components of perceptions of social context; (b) perceptions of social context mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and job satisfaction; (c) job performance was positively predicted by job satisfaction; and (d) finally, the relationship between organizational tenure and job performance became progressively negative as organizational tenure increases, indicating a misfit between the person and the organization for employees hired before the privatization. Our findings suggest interventions directed at enhancing employees' self-efficacy in mastering job tasks under unstable conditions, at supporting supervisors in managing their coworkers, and at improving the fit between higher-tenured employees and the organization...|$|E
40|$|Background: Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) was {{introduced}} in the United Kingdom in 2006 to provide more effective and efficient services to people experiencing mild to moderate mental ill health. The model represents a paradigm shift in how we provide psychological care to large populations. Aims: We wanted to document how the IAPT programme impacted on patients’ understanding of their mental health, and mental health treatment. Methods: We used Foucauldian Discourse Analysis to analyse six semi-structured research interviews with patients from one IAPT service in a major UK city. Results: Participants constructed their mental health problems as individual pathologies. Constructions of mental health and of treatment evidenced the privileging of personal responsibility and social productivity over dependency on others and the state. Conclusions: Services are functioning well for some. The role of IAPT in pathologising those who are dependent on people and services requires further commentary and action. Declaration of interest: The first author was employed by the same organisation that delivered the IAPT service, although through a separate <b>staffing</b> <b>and</b> management <b>line...</b>|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{analysis}} consistently shows transport {{as being}} amongst {{the top three}} contributors to a university’s ecological footprint. This paper reports on a study undertaken at the Mawson Lakes Campus of the University of South Australia into cycling as a sustainable transport option. First, the paper analyzes the campus as a text: an artifact which addresses a particular audience and is actively read and interpreted by those who travel through it. In reading the campus, we go beyond examining levels of cycling infrastructure provision to consider the way infrastructure provision constitutes and positions different travelers as (ab) normal. Second, the paper looks at different groups of cyclists on campus, why some commuted to university and others did not and the experiences {{of each of these}} groups. It is found that cyclists are largely written out of the Mawson Lakes text which challenges their legitimacy as travelers and as users of campus space. The research also found substantial differences between groups of commuter and non-commuter cyclists and this division fell along <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> student <b>lines.</b> We conclude by suggesting ways that this and other universities might legitimize cyclists and facilitate cycling as a mode of travel.
