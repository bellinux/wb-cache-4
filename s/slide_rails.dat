25|$|The Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated {{mechanism}} normally {{found in}} rifles, {{as opposed to}} the short recoil or blow-back designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. When a round is fired, gases are ported out through a small hole in the barrel near the breech. These travel forward through a small tube under the barrel, to a cylinder near the front of the barrel. The slide which acts as the bolt carrier has a small piston on the front that fits into this cylinder. When the gases reach the cylinder they push the piston rearward. The slide rides rearward on two rails {{on either side of the}} barrel, both with action springs around them, with a large pin inside the camming surface in the rear of the bolt that causes the bolt to rotate and unlock. A cylindrical mechanism on the left side of the bolt, called the bolt stabilizer assembly, prevents the bolt from rotating freely as the slide moves, enabling it to align correctly with the barrel again as the slide moves it forward. The spring loaded ejector pin is continually being depressed by the case, until the case is free of the chamber and releases tension from the ejector, causing the case to fly out, becoming released from the extractor claw in the process. The slide reaches its rear-most travel, then rides forward again under tension of the springs around the <b>slide</b> <b>rails,</b> the bottom lug of the bolt pushes a new round into the chamber, then the bolt locks up and the gun can be fired again once the trigger is released.|$|E
2500|$|Freestyle skating {{remained}} healthy {{throughout this}} period, with pioneers such as Rodney Mullen inventing {{many of the}} basic tricks that would become the foundation of modern street skating, such as the [...] "Impossible" [...] and the [...] "kickflip". The influence that freestyle exerted upon street skating became apparent during the mid-1980s; however, street skating was still performed on wide vert boards with short noses, <b>slide</b> <b>rails,</b> and large soft wheels. In response to the tensions created by this confluence of skateboarding [...] "genres", a rapid evolution occurred in the late 1980s to accommodate the street skater. Since few skateparks were available to skaters at this time, street skating pushed skaters to seek out shopping centers and public and private property as their [...] "spot" [...] to skate. (Public opposition, in which businesses, governments, and property owners have banned skateboarding on properties under their jurisdiction or ownership, would progressively intensify over the following decades.) By 1992, {{only a small fraction}} of skateboarders continuing to take part in a highly technical version of street skating, combined with the decline of vert skating, produced a sport that lacked the mainstream appeal to attract new skaters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pressurised}} {{cabin was}} used to counter the physiological problems encountered by pilots at high altitudes. The cabin was not like the fully pressurised cabin of a modern airliner; the pressure differential provided by the modified cockpit of the VI was only two {{pounds per square inch}} (which was double the Air Ministry requirement). To achieve this, the forward and rear cockpit bulkheads were completely enclosed, with all control and electrical cables exiting though special rubber sealing grommets. In addition, the side cockpit door was replaced with alloy skin and the canopy was no longer a sliding unit: externally there were no <b>slide</b> <b>rails.</b> Once the pilot was in, the canopy was locked in place with four toggles and sealed with an inflatable rubber tube. It could be jettisoned by the pilot in an emergency. The windscreen of production Mk VIs was the same as the type fitted to the Mark III and some Mk Vs although it was fitted with an inward opening clear-view panel on the port quarter pane. The effect was to make [...] seem like [...] to the pilot, who would still have to wear an oxygen mask. Pressurisation was achieved by a Marshall-manufactured compressor located on the starboard side of the engine, fed by a long intake below the starboard exhaust stubs. Mk VIs were built with the Coffman cartridge starter, with a small teardrop fairing just ahead of the compressor intake.|$|E
50|$|Early Model 88s were {{equipped}} with a single <b>slide</b> <b>rail,</b> but this was updated to a dual <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> in 1990. Also the Maverick 88 {{does not have a}} receiver top pre-drilled and tapped for a Weaver scope mount rail.|$|R

50|$|Grendel Inc., {{founded by}} George Kellgren, was a Florida {{firearms}} company which produced polymer framed semi-automatic pistols from 1987 to 1994.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper details an experimental-numerical approach for the quantitative correlation between wear and end-point deflection in a <b>slide</b> <b>rail.</b> Focusing the attention on <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> utilized in white-goods applications, the aim is to evaluate the number of cycles the <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> can operate, under different load conditions, before it should be replaced due to unacceptable end-point deflection. In this paper, two formulations are utilized to describe the wear: Archard model for the linear wear and Lemaitre damage model for the non- linear wear. The linear wear gradually reduces the surface of the <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> whereas the non- linear one accounts for the surface element deletion (i. e. due to pitting). To determine the constants to use in the wear models, simple tension test and sliding wear test, by utilizing a designed and developed experiment machine, have been carried out. A full <b>slide</b> <b>rail</b> model simulation has been implemented in ABAQUS including both linear and non-linear wear models and the results have been compared with those of the real rails under different load condition, provided by the rail manufacturer. The comparison between numerically estimated and real rail results proved the reliability of the developed numerical model, limiting the error in a ± 10 % range. The proposed approach allows predicting the displacement vs cycle curves, parametrized for different loads and, based on a chosen failure criterion, to predict the lifetime of the rail...|$|R

50|$|A large {{redesign}} {{effort was}} made by Stechkin. He took several inspirations from the Makarov pistol, such as the general silhouette, <b>slide</b> <b>rails,</b> extractor. The gun was lightened, the trigger mechanism redesigned and simplified, and the trigger guard reshaped. After successful military tests, the APS was formally adopted on the 3rd of December, 1951.|$|E
50|$|In 1983 {{production}} of the classic models was largely ceased {{in favor of a}} new series of pistols taking most of their features from the Charles Petter SACM style of pistols (also seen in the SIG P210 and CZ-75. Namely, these all had inverted <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> and closed cam path locking. Many also had modular (removable) trigger assemblies. Most were double-action, though some retained the classic style single-action lockwork.|$|E
50|$|A spiral {{recoil spring}} is {{positioned}} horizontally, directly below the barrel between the parallel guides of {{the receiver and}} rails of the breechblock. An illustration of this spring {{is shown in the}} , Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Smith, 1947. When the pistol is discharged, as the breechblock moves to the rear and the <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> travel back in the receiver guides, the cross-beam at the forward end serves to compress the recoil spring against the frame.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1916 Sergeant Foster of 11 Squadron RFC {{improved}} the French hinged mounting {{for the upper}} wing Lewis gun on a Nieuport 11 or 16, by replacing the awkward double hinge of the French mount with a quadrant shaped <b>sliding</b> <b>rail.</b> The <b>sliding</b> <b>rail</b> became the feature of all later [...] "Foster" [...] mountings, and enabled the breech of the gun to swing back and down in one movement, bringing the breech conveniently {{in front of the}} pilot, and making it much easier to change ammunition drums or to clear stoppages.|$|R
50|$|The first railway {{switches}} {{were in fact}} wagon turnplates or <b>sliding</b> <b>rails.</b> Turnplates {{were initially}} made of two or four pieces of wood, circular in form, that replicated the track running through them. Their diameter matched that of the wagons used on any given wagonway, and they swung around a central pivot. Loaded wagons could be moved onto the turnplate, and rotating the turnplate 90 degrees allowed the loaded wagon to be moved to another piece of wagonway. Thus, wagon weight was limited only by {{the strength of the}} wood used in the turnplates or <b>sliding</b> <b>rails.</b> When iron and later steel replaced stone and wood, weight capacity rose again.|$|R
50|$|Freestyle {{skiing is}} a skiing {{discipline}} comprising aerials, moguls, cross, half-pipe and slopestyle {{as part of}} the Winter Olympics. It can consist of a skier performing aerial flips and spins, and can include skiers <b>sliding</b> <b>rails</b> and boxes on their skis. It is also commonly referred to as freeskiing, jibbing, as well as many other names around the world.|$|R
50|$|The {{flexible}} conveyor {{is based}} on a conveyor beam in aluminum or stainless steel, with low friction <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> guiding a plastic multi-flexing chain. Products to be conveyed travel directly on the conveyor, or on pallets/carriers. These conveyors can be worked around obstacles and keep production lines flowing. They are made at varying levels and can work in multiple environments. They are used in food packaging, case packing, and pharmaceutical industries but also in retail stores such as Wal-Mart and Kmart.|$|E
5000|$|Because the [...]400 Corbon {{operates}} at much lower pressures than the 10 mm, modern 1911s {{can be converted}} to it without suffering the cracked frames and <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> that plagued the 10 mm Colt Delta Elite. Since a [...]400 Corbon conversion virtually matches the performance of the 10 mm yet does not require purchasing another handgun, some call it the [...] "cheap man's 10 mm". Plus, one retains the versatility of easily switching back to [...]45 ACP whenever you desire.|$|E
50|$|A {{key feature}} of the pistol is its modular design. The main module of the P250 is an {{internal}} stainless steel frame fire control unit which consists of the integrated fire control group (trigger, hammer and all necessary linkage and springs), ambidextrous slide release (one {{on each side of}} the pistol), ejector and four <b>slide</b> <b>rails.</b> This steel receiver unit is used in every P250 grip module, top end, and chambering combination and is inserted into the grip frame module and held in place by the axis pin of the disassembly lever. The firearm's serial number is on the fire control unit instead of the grip module. The fire control unit allows the operator to interchange differently-sized slide assembly or top end modules and polymer grip frame modules and trigger shoes and (limited) chambering conversions to adapt the gun to the individual user and address different needs.|$|E
50|$|The first {{option is}} the most common, with the foot {{stretcher}} and flywheel both fixed, with only the seat <b>sliding</b> on a <b>rail.</b> This is generally analogous to the seat <b>sliding</b> on <b>rails</b> in the boat. Commonly called a 'Fixed head' ergometer.|$|R

As well, skiers can switch-up more than 180 degrees; for example, a '360-switch-up'/'3-swap' involves the skier jumping on a rail feature, spinning 360 degrees, and landing again on the rail.|$|R

5000|$|However, the {{problems}} with turnplates and <b>sliding</b> <b>rails</b> were twofold. First, they were relatively small (often no more than [...] in length), which limited the wagon length that could be turned. Second, their switching capacity could only be accessed when the wagon {{was on top of}} them and still, which limited the total capacity of any wagonway. The railway switch, which overcame both of these problems, was patented by Charles Fox in 1832.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Slide</b> <b>rails</b> {{are usually}} {{fabricated}} by roll forming {{and are used}} in kitchenware and cabinets mostly. However the product weight of <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> is increased because larger dimensions are required to bear larger load when they are used in dies and warehouses. International suppliers start to develop Aluminum <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> to decrease the product weight in recent years. The manufacturing and functional feasibility of Aluminum slide rail were discussed in this study. The Aluminum slide rail was designed according to ready-made slide rail, and the aluminum alloy was selected with required mechanical properties. The suitable extrusion die was designed and direct extrusion parameters of extrusion ratio, extrusion temperature, extrusion speed and extrusion load are also considered. The extrusion process of aluminum alloy was simulated by CAE software to check the mold and process design. The extrusion part of aluminum slide rail {{was carried out by}} extruder to verify the simulation results...|$|E
40|$|A {{device for}} {{enabling}} a wheelchair user {{to enter and}} exit the wheelchair includes a stabilizing frame. The stabilizing frame has two <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> to which a base plate is movingly attached. An electric motor drives a leadscrew, causing the base plate to move along the <b>slide</b> <b>rails.</b> A telescopic column is vertically mounted onto the base plate. The seat assembly, including handlebars and a seat platform, is rotationally attached {{to the top of}} the telescopic column. The telescopic column is extended and collapsed by a linear actuator, raising and lowering the seat assembly. A stationary non-rotational rod is vertically mounted onto the telescopic column. When a user sitting on the seat platform exerts a moment force on the stationary rod, the seat assembly rotates about the stationary rod. A locking mechanism prevents the seat assembly from rotating when the user is transferring to or from the seat platform...|$|E
30|$|The arm can rotate {{and move}} a gripper, {{attached}} to the robot base, along the vertical axis. The rotation of the gripper occurs around the vertical axis. We adopt a multi-step vertical movement mechanism. Fig.  4 a shows {{an overview of the}} multi-step up–down mechanism. By connecting the five-step <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> with the chains and the sprockets, all of the <b>slide</b> <b>rails</b> are driven relative to the movement of the top rail. The rotary motion of the servo motor is transformed to linear motion by the ball screw allowing the top slide rail to move {{up and down in the}} vertical direction. This mechanism is based on the extension mechanism of a ladder truck. Fig.  4 b, c show the installation of the multi-step up–down mechanism in the actual process. When the vertical component is contracted, all parts are held above the worker, which prevents collisions with the worker and ensures the worker’s safety.|$|E
