5000|$|In radiometry, radiant {{exitance}} or radiant emittance is the radiant flux emitted by a surface per unit area, whereas <b>spectral</b> <b>exitance</b> or spectral emittance is the {{radiant exitance}} of a surface per unit frequency or wavelength, {{depending on whether}} the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. This is the emitted component of radiosity. The SI unit of radiant exitance is the watt per square metre (...) , while that of <b>spectral</b> <b>exitance</b> in frequency is the watt per square metre per hertz (W·m−2·Hz−1) and that of <b>spectral</b> <b>exitance</b> in wavelength is the watt per square metre per metre (W·m−3)—commonly the watt per square metre per nanometre (...) [...] The CGS unit erg per square centimeter per second (...) is often used in astronomy. Radiant exitance is often called [...] "intensity" [...] in branches of physics other than radiometry, but in radiometry this usage leads to confusion with radiant intensity.|$|E

(Note {{that it is more}} convenient to express the wavelength of light in terms of nanometers; <b>spectral</b> <b>exitance</b> would then be expressed in units of W·m−2·nm−1.) The approximation is valid when the area and wavelength interval are small.|$|E
40|$|There {{appears to}} be several things wrong with the applet 'Explore the Planck Function'. (1) the {{conversion}} between Kelvin and Fahrenheit is incorrect. For example, when 300 K is shown, the temperature in Fahrenheit should be 80. 33 degrees, but 46. 9 degrees is shown. (2) The ordinate is labeled 'Watt per unit area per micron' but should be labeled 'Watt per square meter per micron' so that the poor student will know the proper units. Perhaps not every student remembers that unit area in the MKS system is a square meter. Its always good to remind them. (3) The title of this function is called 'Blackbody Flux', but flux or radiant flux is total radiated power in watts. The student is being shown how an object with a certain absolute temperature radiates over a spectrum of wavelengths, not just the total radiation. Radiant exitance is power radiated per area; more exactly, watts per square centimeter. <b>Spectral</b> <b>exitance</b> is Radiant exitance over a limited spectrum, usually 1 micron. <b>Spectral</b> <b>exitance</b> is radiated power in watts per square centimeter per micron. A more descriptive title, therefore, would be 'Blackbody Spectral Exitance'. (4) Has the student had the concept of 'blackbody' explained to her? (5) The function doesn't seem to generate proper <b>spectral</b> <b>exitance.</b> Here is Planck's Law for spectral exitance: M(e) = c 1 /[lambda^ 5 (exp(x) - 1) ] where c 1 = 3. 74 x 10 ^ 4 watts um^ 4 /sq centimeter lambda = wavelength in um x = c 2 /(lambda) (T) c 2 = 14388 umK T = absolute temperature in K The constants given are approximate. When I used t = 300 K and lambda = 10 um, the curve shown did not match my computed result exactly. Reference: 'Fundamentals of Infrared Detector Operation and Testing' by John Vincent, Pub. John Wiley & Sons. (6) Perhaps more insight could be gained by the student if temperature could be extended higher to show in more graphic terms how the peak exitance shifts to shorter wavelengths with increasing temperature. Study a physics book before using the applet "Exploring the Planck Function'. ...|$|E

50|$|Note that in {{the above}} formula for Planck’s Law, {{you might as well}} use c1L = 2hc2 (the first {{radiation}} constant for spectral radiance) instead of c1 (the “regular” first radiation constant), in which case the formula would give the spectral radiance L(λ,T) of the black body instead of the <b>spectral</b> radiant <b>exitance</b> M(λ,T). However, this change only affects the absolute values of XT, YT and ZT, not the values relative to each other. Since XT, YT and ZT are usually normalized to YT = 1 (or YT = 100) and are normalized when xT and yT are calculated, the absolute values of XT, YT and ZT do not matter. For practical reasons, c1 might therefore simply be replaced by 1.|$|R
