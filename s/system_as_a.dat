5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on March24 to the east-southeast of the Marshall Islands. Initially {{it consisted}} of a broad but consolidating circulation, with outflow to the north offsetting moderate wind shear to aid in development. It gradually became better organized, with a curved area of convection wrapping into the center. On March26, the JMA classified the <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression just east of Pohnpei. On March27, the JTWC started tracking the <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Tropical Depression 04W. Moving west-northwestward, the system's center became more consolidated with convective banding becoming wrapped into it. The JTWC upgraded 04W to a tropical storm the same day, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Maysak.|$|E

5|$|During late November, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted about 625kilometers (390mi) east-southeast of Pohnpei. Satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic {{turning in}} {{the lower levels of}} the atmosphere, and a trough was located near the surface. The disturbance developed rainbands and gradually became better organized. By December2, the system had an elongated low-level circulation, located to the south of the convection. At 0600UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression about 735km (450mi) east-northeast of Pohnpei. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and at 1800UTC on December 2 the agency classified the system as Tropical Depression 31W. Initially the depression moved to the west-northwest, and early on December3 the JTWC classified the <b>system</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm.|$|E
