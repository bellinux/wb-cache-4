40|$|A {{modeling}} {{approach was}} used to identify measures at the farm that reduce transmission of microorganisms to raw milk. Butyric acid bacteria (BAB) and Bacillus cereus were used as case-studies. Minimizing the concentration of BAB spores in raw milk is important to prevent late-blowing of Gouda-type cheeses. Reducing the concentration of B. cereus spores in raw milk increases the shelf life of refrigerated pasteurized dairy products. First, predictive models were developed based on a translation of contamination pathways into chains of unit-operations. Via simulations, strategies were identified to control spore concentrations in farm tank milk (FTM) below 1, 000 spores/L. Subsequently, the identified strategies were validated using data from a year-long field survey held at 24 Dutch farms. The {{results of this study}} show that mathematical modeling is very useful to identify effective measures to reduce the contamination of FTM with spores. The control strategies derived using model simulations were in agreement with results from the field survey. The following general conclusions were drawn: ·         To minimize the concentration of BAB spores in FTM, it is by far most important to prevent growth of BAB in grass- and corn-silage. Farmers should aim for a concentration in grass- and corn-silage fed to cows below 1, 000 spores/g. To achieve this, it is essential to prevent oxygen penetration into the <b>silage</b> <b>silo</b> and to remove molded and deteriorated silage from the ration fed to the cows. Measures aimed at other parts of the contamination pathway, such as teat cleaning prior to milking, are much less effective. ·         The concentration of B. cereus spores in FTM is normally below 1, 000 spores/L. During housing and pasturing spores of B. cereus in FTM originate from feeds. Two critical factors could lead to concentrations above 1, 000 spores/L. Firstly, the contamination teats with soil is a high risk because soil can contain high concentrations of B. cereus spores. Secondly, build-up of B. cereus in improperly cleaned milking equipment could lead to high spore concentrations in FTM. ·         Implementation of the measures identified in this study could make late-blowing of Gouda-type cheeses a rare incident and prolong the shelf life of refrigerated pasteurized consumer milk by approximately 10 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT. High densities in bunker silos {{minimize}} {{losses and}} reduce storage costs; however, the guidelines to attain high densities {{are based on}} relatively little research. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine those practices or factors most correlated with bunker silo density. Density was measured in 175 bunker silos across Wisconsin using core samples collected at chest height (1. 13 m, 3. 70 ft, on average) across the feed-out face. Silo filling practices were surveyed and correlated with density. Most silages sampled were alfalfa or corn. Dry matter densities ranged from 106 to 434 kg/m 3 (6. 6 to 27. 1 lb/ft 3). The core densities were correlated with the height of silage above the core, indicating the effect of selfcompaction. To adjust for this, all densities were corrected for the median depth below the surface (2. 16 m or 7. 09 ft) using the equations of Pitt (1983) for density with height for the center of tower silos. The adjusted dry matter densities were most strongly correlated with how thinly a load was spread (L), tractor weight (W), packing time per tonne as-fed (T), and dry matter content (D). These four factors were combined into a packing factor [W (TD) 1 / 2 L – 1] that explained 18. 2 % of the variation in dry matter density. Additional factors such as the use of dual wheels, etc. did not significantly improve the prediction of dry matter density.

40|$|The {{national}} {{guidelines for}} design of <b>silage</b> bunker <b>silo</b> walls {{are not available}} today. The present calculation and design is based on previously issued guidelines. These were elaborated {{to be used in}} designing silo wall heights of maximum 3 m. There are reasons to believe that these guidelines overestimate the forces and pressures, mainly from silage juice, that are occurring especially for silo walls > 3 m. This could result in over-sizing, material waste and increased investment costs. The aim of the project is to determine silage physical properties of importance for the horizontal wall pressure and evaluate maximum silage juice level of silos with a wall height of 3 m or more. The data will form a basis for new national design guidelines and a revised Swedish Standard. The ultimate goal is to lower the investment costs for <b>silage</b> bunker <b>silos.</b> A pressure profile was acquired by means of transducers mounted on a “ladder rack” placed vertically along the inside silo wall. The pressure on the transducers was recorded by a data acquisition system displaying static and total load (pressures imposed by silage matter and compacting tractor). The silage juice levels were measured by slotted 16 mm steel pipes placed vertically along the silo walls. The level inside the pipe was determined by a measuring stick. Additionally the juice level could be registered in one of the legs of the “ladder rack”. Silage juice level measurement were carried out during two seasons, all together in 24 silos, while pressure profiles were measured during 10 grass and maize harvests in one season, with approximately 400 pressure profiles at each harvest. The static loads were recorded with no tractor present and total loads as a tractor was passing in front of the transducer racks. The difference between the static and the total load was defined as the dynamic load. Preliminary results show that the silage juice level can vary considerably between harvests within the farm due to weather conditions and geographic location in Sweden.

For ensiling, whole-crop aruana grass (75 d of growth) was chopped (275 g kg- 1 dry matter - DM) and ensiled alone or associated with gliricidia (270 g kg- 1 DM; 150 d of growth). For gliricidia, we used only the leaves and stalks to ensile. The evaluated treatments were different ratios of aruana grass to gliricidia (100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75, and 0 : 100), with four replicates (mini-silos). The silage composed only of gliricidia exhibited a lower pH than the other silages. Dry matter recovery was not affected by the treatments, although effluent losses were affected. The replacement of aruana grass by gliricidia 50 % at ensiling resulted in a higher lactic acid bacteria count. The aruana grass silages displayed lower protein contents and a higher neutral detergent fiber content than the gliricidia silages after 40 d of fermentation.

Using lab scale silage, possible solutions for these large losses were investigated. Addition of 10 % maize did reduce the effluent losses but dry matter losses remained at a high level. Addition of 4, 5 l propionic acid per ton beets reduced effluent and dry matter losses sufficiently. Ensilaging foliage was another point of interest.

Utilizou-se uréia (1 % na matéria verde) como aditivo e os inoculantes microbianos Lalsil cana® contendo a bactéria heterolática Lactobacillus buchneri (cepa NCIMB 40788) na razão de 3, 65 &# 215; 10 (5) ufc/g massa verde (MV) e um inoculante não {{comercial}} contendo a combinação de bactérias homo e heteroláticas Pedioccocus pentosassus e Lactobacillus buchneri (1 &# 215; 10 (6) ufc/g de massa verde). As amostragens foram realizadas após 110 dias de fermentação. A utilização de uréia e principalmente do aditivo Lactobacillus buchneri + Pediococcus foi eficaz em diminuir a produção de etanol (1, 30 e 2, 75 % vs 8, 27 % na silagem controle), as perdas de matéria seca (47 e 60 %) e o consumo de carboidratos solúveis (22 e 56 %) e em aumentar a digestibilidade {{in vitro}} da matéria seca (14, 7 e 12, 4 %) quando comparados à silagem controle, respectivamente. Apesar dos altos teores de ácido acético em todas as silagens, principalmente nas silagens acrescidas da combinação de bactérias homo e heteroláticas, não foram verificados efeitos dos inoculantes sobre a população de leveduras. Os valores de pH e ácido lático da silagem com uréia foram maiores que os obtidos na silagem controle. As silagens com L. buchneri apresentaram neste estudo maior produção de etanol (11, 53 % vs 8, 27 %, silagem controle), o que refletiu em perdas significativas e baixa recuperação de matéria seca, além de baixa digestibilidade pela perda de carboidratos solúveis e pelo acúmulo de FDN, que foram similares aos das silagens sem aditivo. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate chemical additive and microbial inoculants effectiveness on fermentative changes that lead to the inhibition of the ethanol production and reduction of dry matter losses in sugarcane <b>silages.</b> <b>Silos</b> were made in 20 liter plastic buckets provided with a Bunsen type valve that allows gas to escape and a device to collect effluents. The applied additives were urea (1 % of fresh forage); microbial additive Lalsil cana®, that has heterolactic bacteria Lactobacillus buchneri (NCIMB 40788), 3. 65 &# 215; 10 (5) CFU g- 1 of fresh forage, and a non-commercial additive with homolactic bacteria Pedioccocus pentosassus and Lactobacillus buchneri (1 &# 215; 10 (6) CFU g- 1 FM) supplied by Lallemand Inc. (Montreal, Quebec). Sampling occurred after 110 days of fermentation. Urea and mainly the additive Lactobacillus buchneri and Pediococcus were efficient on the reduction of ethanol production (1. 30 and 2. 75 % versus 8. 27 % in the control treatment), on the reduction of dry matter losses (47 and 60 %) and soluble carbohydrates (22 and 56 %), and increase in vitro dry matter digestibility (14, 7 and 12, 3 %) when compared to the control silages, respectively. Despite the high values of acetic acid in all silages, mainly in silages inoculated with homo and heterolactic bacteria, it was not verified effects on yeast population. The silage with urea had greater values of pH and lactic acid compared to control silage. Silages with L. buchneri had, in this experiment, the largest ethanol production (11. 53 % vs 8. 27 % from control silage), resulting in greater losses and lower dry matter recovery. In addition, these silages also showed lower digestibility because of soluble carbohydrates losses and NDF accumulation, similar to the silages without additive...|$|R

Wrapped forages, in {{the form}} of silage and haylage, have become more common in horse diets during recent years. Silage and haylage is {{commonly}} produced in big bales. However, for use in stables with few animals, these bales often contain too much forage to be consumed before onset of aerobic deterioration. Smaller bales are therefore of interest, but knowledge of the chemical composition (including vitamin content), fermentation pattern and changes in those variables during storage of small bales is limited, and was therefore investigated. Small bale forage contained higher pH, higher ethanol and lower lactic acid content, compared to general levels in chopped <b>silo</b> <b>silage,</b> but low levels of ammonia-N and butyric acid. There were no general effects of dry matter or extent of fermentation on α-tocopherol and β-carotene contents in the preserved forages, but linear positive correlations between the vitamins and lactic acid existed. In general, long-term storage (14 months) of small bales influenced fermentation variables, yeasts and pH, but silage wa...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of fermentation and aerobic stability were evaluated in corn silage inoculated with different doses of Lactobacillus buchneri. The whole corn plant (300 g/kg DM) was ensiled in quadruplicate laboratory silos (7 L). L. buchneri 40788 was applied at 5 × 10 (4), 1 × 10 (5), 5 × 10 (5) and 1 × 10 (6) cfu/g of fresh forage. Silages with no additive {{were used as}} controls. After 130 d of ensiling, the silages were subjected to an aerobic stability evaluation for 12 days, in which chemical and microbiological parameters {{as well as the}} temperature of the silage were measured to determine the aerobic deterioration. The addition of L. buchneri resulted in increased acetic acid concentrations. The number of yeast colonies was low in all treated silages. The pH, lactic and propionic acid concentrations did not differ between silages. Under aerobic conditions, all the treated silages showed a low number of yeasts and a great aerobic stability.

40|$|Isoflavones {{are natural}} plant {{substances}} that attract widespread interest {{because of their}} association with a large variety of beneficial effects on human health. When they are ingested by animals or humans, most of these compounds are metabolized by bacteria present in the digestive system. Among the isoflavone microbial metabolites, equol {{is probably the most}} widely studied because it seems to have numerous health benefits. In the human population, however, not everyone is able to produce equol. Equol enrichment of some food, such as cow's milk, could be an alternative strategy for making equol’s health benefits available to everyone. The main objective of the present thesis was to develop analytical tools for quantifying these compounds in several biological matrices, thus contributing to the feasibility study being conducted on producing milk naturally enriched with equol. For this purpose, four analytical procedures, using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC®-MS/MS), were developed and fully validated. The analytical tools were then applied successfully in two original exploratory studies that sought to quantify equol concentrations in commercial cow's milk in Belgium and study the evolution of isoflavone concentration in red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) <b>silage</b> in laboratory-scale <b>silos.</b> This thesis describes new and reliable analytical tools that will help to improve current knowledge about the feasibility of producing cow's milk naturally enriched with equol and to study isoflavone metabolization in dairy cow...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Bag silos made {{at three}} {{research}} farms in 2000 and 2001 were monitored at filling and emptying to determine densities and losses. A total of 47 bags (23 alfalfa, 1 red clover, 23 whole−plant corn) were made, and losses were calculated on 39 of the silos. Dry matter (DM) density ranged from 160 to 270 kg/m 3. Dry matter density increased with DM content in hay crop silages on average 2. 9 kg/m 3 − % DM, whereas the effect in corn silage varied by bagging machine. Density decreased with increasing particle size at 4. 1 kg DM/m 3 per mm. The operator and the bagging machine setup both affected density. A wide range (0 % to 40 %) of DM losses was observed. Average DM losses were 9. 2 % invisible plus uncollected losses and 5. 4 % spoilage losses, {{for a total}} loss of 14. 6 %. Six silos had excessive spoilage losses of more than 15 % and total losses above 25 % due to plastic integrity issues or overly dry silage (> 40 % DM) being fed out in warm weather. Invisible losses were reduced in high−porosity silages (where spoilage losses were exacerbated), greater in warm weather, and affected by emptying procedures. Spoilage losses in bags without plastic integrity issues were greater in dry <b>silages,</b> from emptying <b>silos</b> in warm weather, at lower feed−out rates, in bags stored for a long time, and if bags were emptied periodically rather than daily...|$|R

40|$|Several methodologies {{have been}} tested to {{evaluate}} silage density, with direct methods most popular, whereas indirect methods {{that can be used}} under field conditions are still in development and improvement stages. This study aimed to establish relationships between estimates of maize silage density determined using a direct and an indirect method, in an endeavor to provide an alternative to direct measurement for use in the field. Measurements were performed on maize <b>silage</b> in 14 <b>silos.</b> The direct method involved the use of a metal cylinder with a saw-tooth cutting edge attached to a chainsaw to extract a core of silage. Density of the silage was determined taking into consideration the cylinder volume and dry matter weight of silage removed at 5 points on the silage face. With the indirect method, a digital penetrometer was used to estimate silage density by measuring the penetration resistance at 2 points adjacent to the spots where the silage cores were taken, i. e. 10 readings per silo. Values of penetration resistance (measured in MPa) were correlated with the values of silage mass (kg/m 3) obtained by direct measurement through polynomial regression analysis. A positive quadratic relationship was observed between penetration resistance and silage density for both natural matter and dry matter (R² = 0. 57 and R² = 0. 80, respectively), showing that the penetrometer was a reasonably reliable and simple indirect method to determine the density of dry matter in maize silage. Further testing of the machine on other silos is needed to verify these results. Keywords : Ensiled matter, penetrometer, resistance, silos evaluation. </p...|$|R
