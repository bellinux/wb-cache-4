5000|$|OpenSim is {{employed}} as free open source standalone software, thus enabling a decentralized configuration of all educators, trainers, and users. Scott Provost, Director at the Free Open University, Washington DC, writes: [...] "The advantage of Standalone is that Asset server and Inventory server are local {{on the same}} server and well connected to your sim. With Grids that is never the case. With Grids/Clouds that is never the case. On OSGrid with 5,000 regions and hundreds of users scalability problems are unavoidable. We plan on proposing 130,000 Standalone mega regions (in US schools) with Extended UPnP Hypergrid services. The extended services would include a suitcase or limited assets that would be live on the client". Such a standalone sim offers 180,000 prims for building, and can be distributed pre-configured together with a virtual world viewer using a USB <b>storage</b> <b>stick</b> or SD card. Pre-configured female and male avatars can also be stored on the stick, or even full-sim builds can be downloaded for targeted audiences without virtual world experience. This is favorable for introductory users who want a sandbox on demand and have no clue how to get started.|$|E
40|$|Stick-slip is a non-smooth {{transition}} {{occurring at}} {{the interface between}} two solids in frictional contact and in relative motion. It {{is associated with a}} variation of frictional resistance during sliding and results in a dynamic instability due to a temporal succession of phases of elastic energy <b>storage</b> (<b>stick</b> phase) followed by phases of energy release (slip phase) with an associated tangential stress drop at the contact. On the contrary, continuous (or smooth) sliding occurs when the whole interface undergoes sliding without stick phases. The onset of the instability was usually related to the difference between the static and the dynamic coefficient of friction, to a rate-weakening feature of the friction coefficient or to a variation of friction coefficient along the interface [1]. Nevertheless it has been observed [2 - 4] that stick-slip motion also arises in systems without such assumption, i. e. with a constant friction coefficient and no distinction between static and kinetic friction. Stick-slip in this case arises as a consequence of a dynamic instability involving the coupling between normal and tangential motion [2] or to a destabilization of the interface waves [5]. Recent literature stated that the variation of frictional resistance is rather the result of both the frictional properties at the interface and the elastic and inertial properties of the system [6 - 7], assuming that stick-slip configures as an interchange between the elastic energy stored into the system and its kinetic energy by means of the friction force. More generally the frictional behaviour of a system has been associated with a more complex mutual interaction between the local dynamics at the frictional interface (wave generation and propagation) and the global dynamics of the systems [8 - 16]. The aim {{of this paper is to}} account for local wave generation and propagation rather than just macroscopic dynamics; the transition between stick-slip and continuous sliding is investigated in function of the variations of the local contact dynamics highlighting its key role...|$|E
40|$|This work evaluates three {{different}} conservation methods for {{red and green}} fresh-cut peppers. Red and green fruit were processed into sticks and treated as follows: A) water batch immersion (45 oC, 3 min) (TT), B) UV-C radiation (20 kJ m - 2) or C) modified atmosphere storage (AM). Other group of pepper sticks were left untreated (control). The sticks were stored at 5 oC during 12 d. Fruit decay, soft-rot and respiratory rate were evaluated during storage. The three treatments were effective to reduce sticks deterioration and the treated fruit evidenced lower respiratory rate at 7 d of storage with respect to control. While the three methods were beneficial to maintain quality, in the red sticks the best results were found with TT and UV, mainly because the AM had less control of the soft-rot {{at the end of}} <b>storage.</b> In green <b>sticks</b> all the treatments were equally effective. </div...|$|R
5000|$|Hobey Baker Memorial Rink is a 2,092-seat hockey {{arena in}} Princeton, New Jersey. It {{is home to}} the Princeton University Tigers men's and women's ice hockey teams as well as the venue for club and {{intramural}} hockey teams, intramural broomball, figure skating and recreational skating. It is the only ice skating rink on the Princeton University campus. It is named in honor of former Princeton star Hobart A.H. [...] "Hobey" [...] Baker, '14. Baker was a football and hockey star who died shortly after World War I. In December 1921, it was decided to build an on-campus arena for the hockey team, and to name it after Baker. Efforts to modernize the arena began in the mid-1970s with major improvements including the addition of locker rooms, a skate sharpening room and a <b>stick</b> <b>storage</b> room in 1981, a new scoreboard and lighting improvements in 1984 and a renovation of the roof in 2002. It is the second-oldest arena still in use in NCAA Division I hockey, behind only Matthews Arena at Northeastern University.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Ice-core {{records of}} methanesulphonic acid (MSA) provide a {{potentially}} {{powerful tool for}} producing proxy records of sea ice, a critical but poorly understood component of the Earthâ€™s climate system. However, MSA is able to diffuse through solid ice, and here we {{examine the effect of}} two different methods of frozen storage on the preservation of MSA in archived ice-core samples. Re-analysis of archived ice sticks confirms that MSA diffuses out of ice cores archived in this manner. Despite MSA losses of up to 39 % after 7 years <b>storage,</b> the ice <b>sticks</b> studied here preserve much of the variability of the original MSA record, suggesting that useful proxy records can be obtained from archived ice sticks. Furthermore, re-analysis of ice-core samples that had been refrozen into discrete bottled samples for storage demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} archive ice samples in a way that prevents MSA loss. In this case, accurate records of MSA variability and concentration were preserved even over storage periods of 15 years. This has important implications for the storage of ice cores and subsequent determination of MSA, and demonstrates that ice storage history needs to be considered when interpreting MSA records...|$|R
40|$|Chocolate is a {{confectionery}} product, mainly containing {{cocoa mass}} or liquor, cocoa butter (CB) and sugar. Nowadays vegetable fats and modified oil are {{used instead of}} CB in chocolate products to lower the cost and to obtain the varieties of products with different characteristics and textures. Cocoa butter-like fat from modified palm oil (CBFMPO) {{at different levels of}} CB replacement (60, 80 and 100 %) were used to develop a formulation of coating chocolate. When physical and sensory properties were evaluated, the viscosity and coating ability on biscuit sticks were remarkedly decreased with increasing CBFMPO content. Hedonic mean scores of mouthfeel and coating ability of the chocolate containing 100 % CBFMPO were greater than those of chocolate containing 60 and 80 % CBFMPO (p< 0. 05). During <b>storage</b> of biscuit <b>sticks</b> dipped in the chocolate coating (chocolate containing 100 % CBFMPO) at room temperature (27 - 29 oC) and low temperature (20 - 22 oC) for 30 days, blooming (as shown by whiteness index) occurred to a greater extent at higher temperature. At both storage temperatures, the intensity scores of glossiness and hedonic mean scores of overall liking of samples decreased but intensity scores of off-odor increased during the first 6 of days storage (p< 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to test the effect of {{adhesive}} temperature on the bond strength to dentin (mu TBS) and silver nitrate uptake (SNU) of an ethanol/water (Adper Single Bond 2 [SB]) and an acetone-based (Prime&Bond 2. 1 [PB]) etch-and-rinse adhesive system. Methods: The bottles of each adhesive were kept in various temperatures (5 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 50 degrees C) for 1 h previously to its application in the occlusal demineralized dentin of 40 molars. Bonded sticks (0. 8 mm(2)) were tested in tension (0. 5 mm/min) immediately (IM) or after 6 months (6 M) of water <b>storage.</b> Two bonded <b>sticks</b> from each hemi-tooth were immersed in silver nitrate and analyzed by SEM. Data were analyzed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey`s test (alpha = 0. 05). Results: No significant difference in mu TBS was detected for both adhesives at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C. The highest bond strength for PB was observed in the 37 degrees C group while for SB it was in the 50 degrees C. Significant reductions of bond strengths were observed for PB at 37 degrees C and SB at 50 degrees C after 6 M of water storage. Silver nitrate deposition was seen in all hybrid layers, irrespective of the group. Lower silver nitrate deposition (water trees) in the adhesive layer was seen for PB and SB at higher temperatures. Conclusions: The heating or refrigeration of the adhesives did not improve their resin-dentin bond resistance to water degradation over time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Michael Green, {{founder of}} tapwater. org, {{approached}} Barron {{as a result}} of seeing the TapTop carafe (Barron, REF Output 1). Tapwater. org is a not-for-profit organisation promoting tap water in the UK and beyond, to reduce the use of expensive and environmentally damaging bottled water (Hawkins 2009) by making it easy for users to access free tap water wherever they are: a refilling station every 400 metres in urban areas, mapped across the UK. An online tool and smartphone app are reinforced by stickers in participating shop windows and an education campaign. Barron was engaged with the research and fulfilment of all elements of the enterprise. Tapwater. org has teamed up with others in a worldwide network of refilling points (including Blue W in Canada, Tap It in America, De Dopper, jointhepipe and We Tap Water in Holland). As part of the systemic design, if users purchase the Lifebottle designed by Barron this funds awareness-raising about the damaging effects of bottled waters on the environment, expands the network of refilling stations, and provides mains water machines for schools and universities. To use a refilling point, users need any reusable bottle. Barron did the materials research and competitor analysis, and designed the bottle range, cap with <b>storage</b> and ice <b>stick,</b> accessories and brand identity. The patented design is in stainless steel, appealing and durable; unlike plastic it does not leach chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA). Its vacuum construction keeps water cold for up to 20 hours; a screw-in ice stick can cool water that is not already cold. A patented cap can be used for effervescent flavoured tablets so that users can flavour water at minimal cost. The project has received worldwide coverage from websites and blogs with food-and-drink and environmental themes...|$|R
