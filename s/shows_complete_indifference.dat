50|$|On 14 April 1917 at Fayet, France, during {{operations}} which {{culminated in}} the capture of an important position, Sergeant Ormsby, acting as company sergeant-major <b>showed</b> <b>complete</b> <b>indifference</b> to the heavy machine-gun and rifle fire and set a fine example. After clearing a village he pushed on and drove out many snipers from localities further forward. When the only surviving officer was wounded he took command {{of the company and}} led them forward under heavy fire for 400 yards to a new position, holding it until relieved.|$|R
5000|$|Musician Dave Carroll {{said his}} guitar was broken while in United Airlines' custody. He alleged {{that he heard}} a fellow {{passenger}} exclaim that baggage handlers on the tarmac at Chicago O'Hare International Airport were throwing guitars during a layover on his flight from Halifax Stanfield International Airport to Omaha, Nebraska's Eppley Airfield. He arrived at his destination to discover that his $3,500 Taylor guitar was severely damaged. Fox News questioned Carroll on why he checked the valuable guitar and Carroll explained {{that it is difficult}} to bring guitars onto flights as carry-on luggage. In his song, he sang that he [...] "alerted three employees who <b>showed</b> <b>complete</b> <b>indifference</b> towards me" [...] when he raised the matter in Chicago. Carroll filed a claim with United Airlines which informed him that he was ineligible for compensation because he had failed to make the claim within its stipulated [...] "standard 24-hour timeframe".|$|R
5000|$|Arachnid Omnivoracity - As {{the name}} implies, the Omnivoracity {{was made up}} of large creatures with a {{resemblance}} to spiders. While the Arachnids were intelligent, communication with them was found to be completely impossible. As a result, little is known about them {{other than the fact that}} they were quite advanced, considered all other intelligent races to be food sources (treating captured subject populations much the way a herder treats sheep or cows), and did not care about their own kind, taking absolutely no measures to preserve their lives in battle and <b>showing</b> <b>complete</b> <b>indifference</b> to the massive losses they took. Due to physiological limitations, the Arachnids were completely incapable of operating strikefighters, though they did develop a gunboat-style vessel to compensate for this. The first encounter between Federation and Arachnid vessels led to Interstellar War 4. As with the Rigellians, the attitude of the Arachnids toward other races made peace impossible, and all known Arachnid worlds were destroyed by bombardment from space by the combined fleets of the Alliance - save one small colony hidden, isolated from its homeworld by a hidden warp point. Interstellar War 4 and the fate of the Arachnids is described in the novels [...] "In Death Ground" [...] and [...] "The Shiva Option".|$|R
5000|$|The first {{who were}} sentenced to death were {{executed}} on 19 May 1934. Formerly a guillotine had been used, {{but it had been}} discarded as a French method of decapitation. Since then people were put to death with an executioner's ax. [...] There were the judges of the Special Tribunal and Prosecutor Jauch, all wearing cutawaysand topheads. ... They were followed by a long train of storm troop officers and Elite Guards. ... Last to come was the headsman, a chunky individual with a big-boned face and dull brown eyes. He <b>showed</b> <b>complete</b> emotional <b>indifference</b> to the task ahead of him. He, too, wore a stiff white shirt, striped trousers, a cutaway and a top head. ... the headsman raised his ax over comrade Dettmer's head. He did not strike. He simply let it fall on Johnny's neck. Then, with an easy motion, he drew the blade toward him, and stepped back. Johnny Dettmer's head fell into the basket. Jan Valtin ...|$|R
40|$|In Hungary, during 2010 - 2015 {{the growing}} xenophobic attitudes are {{noticed in the}} society, and right radical extremist groups gain power. The aim of the article is to {{identify}} the most significant factors that encourage xenophobia in Hungary. The types of right organizations and their electoral performance are determined. Our hypothesis is that the activity of right extremist organizations influences the formation of xenophobic social practices in Hungary. By means of factor analysis the author identified the main directions and forms of activity of right radicals, determined the value of socio-economic dynamics of Hungary, characterized the attitudes of society, {{the law and the}} ruling elite to the problems of xenophobia and right radicalism. Among the most influential factors we should name: open propaganda of nationalist ideas; constitutional priority to the interests of ethnic Hungarians; parliamentary membership of the Movement “For a Better Hungary”; condoning by the ruling elite, the courts and the police of the right radical activity. The paper presents the trend in the contemporary Hungary: the public demonstrates intolerance to right radicalism in cases of criminal behavior, {{but for the most part}} is loyal to its ideologies. Except for oppositional human rights organizations and ethnic communities, a significant part of Hungarian society often <b>shows</b> nearly <b>complete</b> <b>indifference</b> to the issues of xenophobia, racial and ethnic discrimination. The author described five groups of factors that stimulate the reproduction of xenophobic attitudes and practices among various groups of the population: “historical”, institutional, socioeconomic, legal and political. The paper uses empirical data of public opinion polls conducted by leading research centers in Hungary, as well as statistical data of public authorities, civil society institutions...|$|R

60|$|To Juliette his {{attitude}} seemed one of <b>complete</b> <b>indifference</b> {{for the wrong}} he had done to her and to her father: feeling {{that she was an}} avenging spirit, with flaming sword in hand, pursuing her brother's murderer like a relentless Nemesis, she would have preferred to see him cowed before her, even afraid of her, though she was only a young and delicate girl.|$|R

5000|$|Leonard Feather's {{opinion of}} Lewis's work is {{representative}} of many other knowledgeable jazz listeners and critics: [...] "Completely self-sufficient and self-confident, he knows exactly what he wants from his musicians, his writing and his career and he achieves it with an unusual quiet firmness of manner, coupled with modesty and a <b>complete</b> <b>indifference</b> to critical reaction." [...] Lewis was not only this way with his music, but his personality exemplified these same qualities.|$|R
60|$|The anger {{with which}} she said it, the more {{remarkable}} for being so much under her restraint, fixed Clennam's attention, and kept him on the spot. It flashed out of her dark eyes as they regarded him, quivered in her nostrils, and fired the very breath she exhaled; but her face was otherwise composed into a disdainful serenity; and her attitude was as calmly and haughtily graceful {{as if she had}} been in a mood of <b>complete</b> <b>indifference.</b>|$|R
60|$|The matter, however, {{had a more}} {{important}} side. Although Beatrice had refused him he did not despair; she had shown {{that she did not}} regard him with <b>complete</b> <b>indifference.</b> It was not his personal character, but his position and her father's hostility that stood in the way, and these were obstacles that might be overcome. He could expect nothing but the Colonel's stern opposition, and he must carefully arm himself for the fight; he did not undervalue the power of his antagonist.|$|R
60|$|His {{task was}} not a simple one.

40|$|Ostensible contradictions between Augustine's {{account of}} the two cities are {{resolved}} by his concealed claim to the privileged epistemic status of a Christian prophet. Faith and grace provide the mobility between this quasi-divine and the fallen human position. Such mobility is impossible in a pluralist and secular system of thought. This is why, having lost the creative Augustinian ambiguity, the liberal philosophy of history and norms of relationship between state and individual continue to veer between the logical end-points of anarchy and <b>complete</b> <b>indifference,</b> or utmost individualism...|$|R
