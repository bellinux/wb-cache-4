40|$|Our {{continent}} has a wretched {{history of}} invasive species. Ecosystems have succumbed to exotic {{animals such as}} foxes, rabbits and carp, {{while at the same}} time being beset by strange, virile plants. "Whenever I travel, I'm always amazed by the hold that exotic species have obtained over this land," <b>says</b> <b>Tim</b> Low of the Invasive Species Council. Two centuries ago, when British fleets brought the first bedraggled convicts to Australia, they brought foreign flora as well - including the infamous prickly pear. Shipped across from South America, the cactus slowly became recognised as one of the most invasive weeds ever imported into the country. By the 1920 s, the pear was no longer a garden ornamental or a ferocious homestead hedge; it had stretched its spiky pads, grown into dense, tangled structures, and covered 25 million hectares of Queensland and New South Wales. Last spring, a federally funded weed-awareness campaign was launched to educate people about the plants we purchase, as a third of weeds in Australia are said to originate in our backyards. "When you talk about weed invasion, it is often very pretty plants escaping out of our gardens that cause the problem," says Low. Weeds, we're told, cost the economy around $ 3. 3 billion a year in control efforts and lost production. At the same time, significant resources have been spent determining what constitutes a weed in the first place. In 1999, after recruiting specialists to study and rank Australia's most troublesome plants, commonwealth ministers announced the inaugural list of 'Weeds of National Significance', with species including pond apple, bridal creeper and lantana labelled especially problematic. On the federal government's weed website, each plant's information is accompanied by a floral mug shot...|$|E

This second edition, with new co-editor Wanhill, offers a similar mix of insights from authoritative contributors drawn from leading universities and practitioners across the world, demonstrating a truly global perspective. Where it justifies its repeated sub-title of new directions' is in looking at life after the hype of the Millennium and big Lottery funding and in the shadow of global warming, not to mention the current rumbles of recession; a life where sustainability is a universal problem. Those attractions which have held their own, <b>says</b> <b>Tim</b> Smit in his foreword, are likely to have strengthened their storytelling and focused on attracting repeat visits, citing Chester Zoo and Dynamic Earth among other leading examples. Grouped into four sections including marketing and development, the contributors pull no punches. Leask, for example, examining the nature and role of visitor attractions, concludes that the growing diversity of stakeholder involvement in any given attraction could contribute to its downfall unless managers can address the potential conflicts of interest and consonant pressures. The major section of this volume focuses on just this. Various contributors are at pains to stress the current overprovision in some areas and sound a warning lest imagination and political pressures lead to the visitor base being spread too thinly for sustainable business. Throughout, contributors offer case studies and tools to make managing these problems less hit-and-miss. In sumary, this is a book that offers authoritative information on the sector along with practical help and inspiration to those labouring at the coal-face...|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} of ATSIC’s role must look more widely across government, <b>says</b> <b>Tim</b> Rowse HARD {{on the heels}} of the fifth ATSIC Regional Council elections in October 2002, Phillip Ruddock has initiated a review of ATSIC 2 ̆ 7 s “role and functions”. From the information available to the public, it seems that the three reviewers have been given little guidance about what questions to ask, and how to answer them. In about six months, John Hannaford, Bob Collins and Jackie Huggins, after discussions with ”a range of stakeholders”, will produce a discussion paper “as a basis for broader public discussion”. If the minister thinks that there is a problem to be fixed, then he has not said what it is. He and the ATSIC chairperson Geoff Clark have used different concepts to name what is at stake for Indigenous Australians. Under Mr Clark ATSIC has invoked “Indigenous rights”, while Mr. Ruddock stresses “practical reconciliation”. Clark’s perspective includes the social policy agenda of “practical reconciliation” - improving housing, education, health, employment and income - but goes beyond it. “Indigenous rights” to a land and sea base and to agencies of “self-determination” are fundamental to Clark’s advocacy. Since 2000, he has used his chairmanship to revive public debate about a treaty that would entrench those rights. From the perspective of the Howard government, this campaign has been a distraction, but not much of a challenge. Whether “Indigenous rights” will remain prominent in ATSIC commissioners’ representations remains to be seen. It is unlikely that the minister 2 ̆ 7 s review would make any difference, and the government seems politically secure in the line it has taken. If anything, it is those who appear not to be concerned with the “practicalities” who are more likely to be on the defensive. So, what might the review be about? The minister 2 ̆ 7 s question is “how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can be best represented in the development of Commonwealth policies“. ATSIC has never spent more than about half of the Commonwealth budget devoted to Indigenous programs. How are Indigenous Australians represented in the policy development process in these other Commonwealth agencies? Broadly there are two answers. The other Commonwealth agencies may or may not have dealings with ATSIC. And these agencies are lobbied by Indigenous organisations to whom they give grants - for example the Department of Health and Aged Care by NACCHO (the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations). Because such lobbying is significant, it would be pointless for the reviewers to limit their discussions to ATSIC and its internal and external relationships. The representation of Indigenous Australians is a question that requires a “whole of government” perspective. And not simply “whole of Commonwealth government”. Indigenous Australians are affected by state and territory policies as well - particularly in issues of land and sea use and in education. Since the 1992 Council of Australian Governments meeting, the problem of state and territory accountability to Indigenous Australians has been on the agenda. Because the states and territories do not have bodies such as ATSIC, Indigenous Australians get a say over their policy development either by grantee lobbying of those governments or by the Commonwealth imposing performance standards on the states and territories. The Commonwealth is internationally accountable for the actions of all Australian governments. Federalism in Indigenous affairs has been an unexpectedly uncomfortable issue for the Howard government. In October 2000, the Commonwealth Grants Commission circulated a draft report on how governments could measure and compare Indigenous needs across regions. Concluding that there was no sound numerical index of comparative need, the commission suggested that “judgement” would continue to determine how the nine Australian governments resource the Indigenous sector. Such “judgements” would be more sound, the commission argued, if Indigenous Australians were genuinely involved in making them - whether as public servants, as organisational partners or as elected representatives. The commission restated this view in its final report in 2001, calling also for the states and territories to be more “transparent” to Commonwealth and Indigenous scrutiny. Not only did the CGC report remind the Commonwealth that it has powers to monitor state and territory performance, it also undermined the antithesis between “practical reconciliation” and “self-determination”. If the “practical reconciliation” dollar is to be spent efficiently, the commission argued, then Indigenous judgment must play a large part in deciding how. Commonwealth policy should thus focus on the channels of Indigenous political representation - across all Commonwealth, state and territory programs. Unfortunately, this is not how Minister Ruddock’s brief to his reviewers is worded. That short document implies that the issue of Indigenous participation in Commonwealth policy development can be squeezed within the box labelled “review of ATSIC”. It can’t be, and if Collins, Hannaford and Huggins are worth their pay it won’t be. Tim Rowse’s book Indigenous Futures was published in August by University of New South Wales Press.
