5|$|Adenhart's number 21 jersey was retired by the Cedar Rapids Kernels, the Angels' Class A affiliate, on June 20, 2010. The Kernels, the Kernels Foundation, and the Adenhart {{family also}} {{established}} the Nick Adenhart Memorial Scholarship, a yearly $1,000 scholarship. The Orem Owlz, for whom Adenhart briefly played in 2005, have worn special jerseys, which bear {{the likeness of}} a <b>screen-printed</b> picture of Adenhart, along with his number 34. The Little League Baseball field where Adenhart played in Halfway, Maryland, was rededicated as the Nicholas James Adenhart Memorial Field. The Hagerstown Suns, the Minor League Baseball affiliate in Hagerstown, Maryland, held a fundraiser for the Nick Adenhart Memorial Fund and added Adenhart to their Wall of Fame at Municipal Stadium. The city of Manhattan Beach, Wilhite's home town, erected the Pearson-Wilhite-Stewart-Adenhart Commemorative Wall at Marine Avenue Park honoring all four victims of the crash.|$|E

2500|$|A full area {{metal contact}} is {{made on the}} back surface, and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine [...] "fingers" [...] and larger [...] "bus bars" [...] are <b>screen-printed</b> onto the front surface using a silver paste. This is an {{evolution}} of the so-called [...] "wet" [...] process for applying electrodes, first described in a US patent filed in 1981 by Bayer AG. The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in ohmic contact with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency. After the metal contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into modules or [...] "solar panels". Solar panels have a sheet of tempered glass on the front, and a polymer encapsulation on the back.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the primary}} {{materials}} used throughout the wardrobe is lycra, primarily for its ease of care, suppleness, and elasticity. [...] Other materials used throughout include titanium rods, nylon sponge {{and other types of}} fire-retardant materials. [...] La Toupie's costume, for example, is made from lycra, and the tentacles are made from polystyrene foam. [...] In addition to textures and structures being created for the costumes, digital screen-printing was utilized for some pieces. [...] The costumes for the Russian swing act were inspired by volcanic eruptions. [...] Pictures were taken, scanned, processed and then digitally <b>screen-printed</b> to give the characters their bright red, explosive appearance. [...] The foliage seen on the heads and backs of some characters is made from crinyl and cristalette, which are both extremely light-weight materials. [...] Some of the translucent carapaces seen on some performers, including La Promise, are made from stretch netting mounted on a structure made of boning.|$|E
2500|$|Individual blanket {{sleepers}} can {{be marketed}} {{either as a}} unisex garment, or as a garment intended for one gender.

[...] (The size numbers are also consistent, as, although there are slight differences in the meanings of size numbers {{between boys and girls}} in the U.S. standard clothing size system, these are too small to matter {{in the case of a}} garment as loose-fitting as a blanket sleeper.) [...] Occasionally, however, sleepers marketed for girls may include effeminate decorative features such as lacy frills, and sleepers with <b>screen-printed</b> front panels may feature images of media characters appealing primarily to children of one gender. [...] Also, the ranges of colors available may be different between the genders, in particular pink sleepers are rarely worn by boys due to a cultural association of that color with femininity. [...] Unisex designs and colors offer a more sustainable option allowing the most use over time.|$|E

40|$|We report here a non-enzymatic {{detecting}} electrode strip {{for fast}} monitoring of uric acid in human whole blood. A single-use amperometric uric acid sensor strip, incorporating a three-electrode configuration, has been fabricated on a polypropylene substrate using low cost <b>screen-printing</b> (thick-film) technology. Both the working and counter electrodes were prepared by <b>screen-printing</b> commercial carbon ink. The integration {{on the same}} support of pseudo-reference electrode was obtained by <b>screen-printing</b> a commercial silver ink and subsequent electrochemical pretreatment. Simply by placing a 20 mu l human whole blood drop on the strip is enough for uric acid analysis by square-wave voltammetry. Real human whole blood samples were analyzed by this method and compared to the phosphotungstic acid clinical test procedure with satisfactory results. (C) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Solid oxide fuel cells are a developing technology where advanced ceramics play a crucial role. Within the fuel cell the most common electrolyte material is yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ). The use of nano particles may provide lower sintering temperatures enabling the possibility of co-sintering the electrolyte with the anode layer. One route for deposition is <b>screen-printing,</b> which is scalable and cost-effective. In this research an aqueous <b>screen-printing</b> route was adopted, which adds the benefits of reduced health and safety risks with reduced costs. The aims of the work were to produce aqueous zirconia inks suitable for <b>screen-printing</b> and to understand the factors involved in ink formulation. The overall objective {{of the project was}} to produce a dense impermeable zirconia layer by <b>screen-printing.</b> Sub-micron (100 nm) and nano (20 nm) primary particles were used to prepare suspensions and inks. The suspensions were optimised for dispersion {{with the addition of a}} dispersant (Darvan C or TAC) by zeta potential and rheological methods. The addition of a binder (Rheolate 216) to the suspensions was used to create a 60 wt...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{prototype}} of low-power thick-film gas sensor deposited by <b>screen-printing</b> onto a micromachined hotplate is presented. The micro-heater {{is designed to}} maintain a film temperature of 400 C with less than 30 mW of input power.
