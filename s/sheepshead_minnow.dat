40|$|The aquatic {{environment}} represents the final sink for many chemicals, including bactericidal agents. Among them Triclosan (TCS) {{has been shown}} to affect the thyroid system of teleost. Larval stages are particularly vulnerable to deleterious effects of endocrine disrupters because of potential impairment of fish development and behaviour. Thyroid hormones are critical {{to the development of the}} brain and auditory system. Thus, TCS could affect the development of the brain and hearing. The aims of this study were: to investigate hearing development in <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnows</b> (Cyprinodon variegatus) using the ABR technique (Auditory Brainstem Response) and to investigate the effects of triclosan on hearing development. Exposure to TCS was conducted from fertilization of eggs on at concentrations likely to be found in the environment: 20, 50 and 100 µgl- 1. We characterized previously the ontogenic variation of thyroid hormones in embryos and larvae of <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnows.</b> We observed an increase of thyroid hormones level around the 12 th and the 15 th day post hatching (dph), that may be associated with the transition from larval to juvenile stage during the development of this species. We concluded, that this period could be defined as a critical exposure window to pollutants. We determined hearing thresholds for <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnows</b> of different ages. Our <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnows</b> show ontogenic variations in the hearing ability during their development. At 30 days post hatching, their hearing ability is quite bad, with a narrow bandwidth of detected frequencies. But their hearing ability considerably enhance during their development to reach the adult hearing ability at around 80 days post hatching when this species reach sexual maturity. So we observe during the developmental phase of this fish species clear ontogenic improvements of the hearing ability and they showed an ontogenetic expansion in the frequency bandwidth they were able to detect. The effects of TCS in this development have yet to be determined but will be fully discussed. This study proposes an interesting new endpoint in thyroid disruption research. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Transgenerational {{plasticity}} (TGP), a type {{of maternal}} effect, occurs when the environment experienced by one or both the parents prior to fertilization directly translates, without changing DNA sequences, into changes in offspring reaction norms. Evidence of such effects {{has been found in}} several traits throughout many phyla, and, although of great potential importance - especially in a time of rapid climate change - TGP in thermal growth physiology had never been demonstrated for vertebrates until the first experiment on thermal TGP in <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnows,</b> who, given sufficient time, adaptively program their offspring for maximal egg viability and growth at the temperature experienced before fertilization. This study on <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnows</b> from South Carolina and Connecticut investigates how population, parent temperature, and offspring temperature affect egg production, size, viability, larval survival and growth rates, whether these effects provide evidence of TGP, and whether and how they vary with length of exposure time (5, 12, 19, 26, 33 and 43 days) of the parents to the new experimental temperatures of either 26 °C or 32 °C. Several results are consistent with those obtained in the previous TGP study, which outline a sequence of events consisting of an initial adjustment period to the new temperatures, in which egg production decreases and no signs of TGP are present, followed by a shift to TGP (towards 26 - 33 days of exposure) in which parents start to produce more eggs which are better adapted to the new thermal environment. Other results present new information, such as signs of TGP in the parent temperature effect on egg sizes already around 20 days of exposure. The innovative idea of populations being able to adapt to rapidly shifting environments through non-genetic mechanisms such as TGP opens new possibilities of survival of species and will have important implications on ecology, physiology, and contemporary evolution...|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} the {{invasive}} fish in the area is as of now, uncertain, but many {{studies have been done}} to figure out what exactly is going on. [...] Some of these studies have shown that this breed of cychlid has spread into Bayou St. John and City Park. The cichlid acts aggressively toward native Largemouth bass, Western mosquitofish, sailfin mollies, and blue crabs. This aggressiveness can occur in the form of tail beating and mouth wrestling. [...] The fish also appears to cause reproductive failure of <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnows.</b> The cichlid was largely unaffected by abiotic events like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita because of its high tolerance for salt-water intake. [...] In fact, these hurricanes actually helped the fish to take over the bayous of New Orleans. When the park flooded during Katrina, it helped the cichlid to spread.|$|R

50|$|Polykrikos hartmannii is a phototrophic dinoflagellate and {{has been}} {{reported}} in waters of Canada, USA, Mexico, China, India, Japan, Korea,. P. hartmanii feeds on algal species by engulfment after anchoring a prey using a nematocyst-taeniocyst complex (later referred to as NTC). Tang et al. observed P. hartmannii bloom that caused 100% mortality in juvenile <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnows</b> (Cyprinodon variegates) within 24 hours suggesting P. hartmannii is an ichthyotoxic, harmful alga. Interestingly, P.hartmannii feeds on chain-forming dinoflagellates Cochlodinium polykrikoides and Gymnodinium catenatum that are also known to cause fish mortality, and therefore P. hartmannii is thought to have enzymes that detoxify toxins produced by these prey dinoflagellates. Also, a comparison of three Polykrikos species feeding revealed that species differ in their prey preference, and some are more specialized than the other, such that P. hartmanii preying is less diverse (fed on 2 prey species) than of P. kofoidii and P. lebouriae, which fed on 14 different algal species.|$|R
5000|$|In Bayou St. John, the cichlid {{threatens to}} {{overwhelm}} native species and ruin {{the efforts of}} the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries to restore the historical fishery of Bayou St. John. Because the fish competes with native fish for shallow mating sites, it reduces the chances of the diverse fishery ever being fully recovered. The fish has already eliminated several smaller fish in this bayou, including killifish and <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnows.</b> In fact, if the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries did not routinely re-stock several midsized species, {{it is likely that the}} cichlid would have eliminated these fish too. Because of this, there is even a competition at the City Park Big Bass Fishing Rodeo & Fishtival to catch the most cichlids. According to a fisherman Joe Adams, who participates in the competition, [...] "They will eat just about anything...I know one guy who catches them with French fries...pieces of a hot dog and pieces of canned corn." [...] Despite these efforts, there is practically no chance or eradicating this fish from New Orleans' waters mainly because of its quick mating cycle.|$|R
40|$|The aquatic {{environment}} represents the final sink for many chemicals, including bactericidal agents. Among them Triclosan (TCS) {{has been shown}} to affect the thyroid system of teleost. Thyroid hormones are involved in the control of metabolism, so changes in hormone levels induced by triclosan may affect respiratory rates and antioxidant stress in exposed fish. Couples of three females and two males were placed in breeding chambers designed for this experiment. Eggs were collected and maintained in seawater. Embryos were selected under a dissection microscope, randomly assigned to each of five treatment groups: Control, DMSO control, 20 μg/L TCS, 50 μg/L TCS and 100 μg/L TCS and placed in incubation dishes (50 per dish) at 25 °C. On day 6, embryos hatched and larvae were transferred to 1 L dishes. The larvae were fed on artemias and on flaked fish food till day 15 and 30 post hatching when the fish were analyzed. Respiratory rate measurements were carried out by respirometry and assays of antioxidant enzymes, Glutathionreductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were conducted to determine the presence of oxidative stress. Respirometry showed that TCS exposed fish exhibited decreased the metabolism at 15 dph, whereas no differences in respiration rate could be observed between control and exposed larvae at 30 dph. At 15 dph no difference was observed for any of the antioxidant enzymes, whereas at 30 dph a sharp increase in the activity of GR was observed between the control and TCS exposed fish. The activity of GST and Gpx remained stable. Thyroid hormones are major factors controlling the metabolic rate related to respiration and oxidative stress. TCS reduced the metabolism at 15 dph that corresponds to the moment where larvae to juvenile transition of <b>Sheepshead</b> <b>minnows</b> occur. Previous experiments showed that TCS induces an increase in thyroid hormone concentrations and hyperthyroidism induces oxidative stress. So our observed increase of antioxidant protection mechanisms could be a way to compensate oxidative stress. On the other hand, the changes in GR activity observed at 30 dph, may also be related to the reduced metabolism at 15 dph. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|There are {{different}} types of toxicity tests that can be performed on various test species. Different species differ in their susceptibility to chemicals, most likely {{due to differences in}} accessibility, metabolic rate, excretion rate, genetic factors, dieteary factors, age, sex, health and stress level of the organism. Common standard test species are the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), daphnids (Daphnia magna, D. pulex, D. pulicaria, Ceriodaphnia dubia), midge (Chironomus tentans, C. ruparius), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> (Cyprinodon variegatu), mysids (Mysidopsis), oyster (Crassotreas), scud (Hyalalla Azteca), grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio), mussels (Mytilus).

5000|$|ELS {{tests were}} adapted from full {{life-cycle}} toxicity tests, chronic tests that expose an organism to a contaminant for its entire life-cycle.

The first full life-cycle tests on fish were developed for the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), and later for bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), flagfish (Jordanella floridae), and <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> (Cyprinodon variegatus). While useful, full life-cycle tests require a high number of test organisms and extensive exposure time in the lab, especially for vertebrates. Typically, life-cycle tests take 6-12 months for fathead minnow and 30 months for brook trout.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> is an omnivore, eating both {{animal and}} {{vegetable}} matter. Its diet mainly consists of detritus, microalgae, crustacean larvae {{and other small}} invertebrates. It is aggressive and will attack fish larger than itself, slashing its prey with its sharp teeth and devouring it when it is subdued. Breeding takes place in shallow water between April and September, the males competing fiercely for the females. A few eggs are spawned at a time, and these are fertilised by the males which grasp the females with their fins. The eggs clump together and sink to the seabed, connected by sticky threads. They hatch after five or six days. During the winter, this fish burrows into the soft substrate and remains dormant.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> is a deep-bodied fish {{growing to}} {{a length of}} up to 75 mm though a more normal length is 30 mm. It is nearly half as deep as it is long, {{excluding}} its tail. It is laterally compressed with flat sides, an arched back and a small head with a flattened top. The small mouth {{is at the end}} of the snout and the teeth are large and wedge-shaped with three cusps. The pectoral fins are large and extend past the origins of the small pelvic fins. The origin of the anal fin hardly overlaps the trailing edge of the dorsal fin. The caudal peduncle is thick and the caudal fin is truncated and square-ended. The arrangement of the fins, the deep body and the tri-cuspid teeth help to distinguish this fish from the mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), which is found in the same habitats. The body is covered by large, circular scales, the ones on the cheeks and the top of the head and a single scale just above the pectoral fin being the largest. The male is generally larger and more deep-bodied than the female, with larger dorsal, pelvic and anal fins.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{habitats}} {{make up the}} bay bottom; the dominant eelgrass Benthic habitat in the cove's of Patchogue Bay which can be classified as muddy sandflat and sandflat habitats. Many species that are found in both habitats. Sandy bottom types worms, slipper shell, and blue mussel, and mud crab. Atlantic oyster dril, a predator of bivalves, is abundant in eelgrass beds in Patchogue and Bellport Bay, and rock crab. The distribution and abundance of benthic species in the bay's eelgrass community is likely controlled {{by a number of}} factors that include eelgrass stem density, water temperature and salinity, sediment type, predation, food supply, and human harvest. Much of the bay is open water, while marshes and flats have developed on the protected northern edge of the barrier beach that shelters Patchogue Bay and the mainland from the Atlantic Ocean. Extensive tidal marshes and flats have developed on the bay side of Fire Island as well. Eelgrass beds are concentrated in the shallow waters along the back side of Fire Island, Silversides, killifish, menhaden, and bay anchovy. Forage fish species are found throughout the various aquatic habitats in the bay at different times of the year. Atlantic silverside, the most dominant member through much of the year, in most of the bay. Bay anchovy is the major mid-bay water column occupant in the summer during its spawning time in late June and July. Killifishes include mummichog in the salt marsh habitats, striped killifish over sandy habitat, and <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> in both habitats. Sticklebacks, including fourspine and threespine, are spring and summer spawners associated with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); although they are very abundant, their use as prey for other fish and birds is limited due to spines, body armor, and close association with vegetative cover. Northern pipefish s) is a zooplankton consumer preyed upon by both striped bass and summer flounder. American sandlance, probably the most abundant winter species, provides important forage for many species of special emphasis in the Bight. Summer flounder enter the bay in winter and spring and grow rapidly in the productive waters. The bay supports significant shellfishery for northern quahog and is a major spawning, nursery, and foraging area for blue crab. Other common aquatic species occurring in the backbarrier lagoon systems of Long Island include blue mussel, bay scallop, eastern oyster, horseshoe crab, American eel, spot, Atlantic croaker, northern kingfish, and northern puffer. There are a number of significant trout resources in streams that drain into The Bay. Nine of the twelve verified wild brook trout populations of Long Island occur in the Bay's drainage. Patchogue's Swan River, and many other local tributaries such as Mud Creek, Patchogue Creek, and Terrel Creek all contain naturally reproducing populations of brook trout.|$|E
40|$|The <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow,</b> Cyprinodon variegatus, is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} small fish species that inhabits estuaries and inshore waters from New England to northern South America. This species has been used extensively in aquatic environmental toxicity and carcinogenicity tests (Couch et al., 1981; Courtney and Couch, 1984). Hepatic neoplasms have been induced in the <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> by exposure to several known chemical carcinogens including diethylnitrosamine (Couch and Courtney, 1987), methylazoxymethanolacetate (Hawkins etal., 1985), and dimethylbenz(a) anthracene (Hawkins et al., 1991).

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> (Cyprinodon variegatus) {{are small}} fish capable of {{withstanding}} exposure to very {{low levels of}} dissolved oxygen, as well as extreme temperatures and salinities. It is an important model in understanding the impacts and biological response to hypoxia and co-occurring compounding stressors such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, endocrine disrupting chemicals, metals and herbicides. Here, we initiated a project to sequence and analyze over 10, 000 ESTs generated from the <b>Sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> (Cyprinodon variegatus) {{as a resource for}} investigating stressor responses. Results We sequenced 10, 858 EST clones using a normalized cDNA library made from larval, embryonic and adult suppression subtractive hybridization-PCR (SSH) libraries. Post- sequencing processing led to 8, 099 high quality sequences. Clustering analysis of these ESTs indentified 4, 223 unique sequences containing 1, 053 contigs and 3, 170 singletons. BLASTX searches produced 1, 394 significant (E-value - 5) hits and further Gene Ontology (GO) analysis annotated 388 of these genes. All the EST sequences were deposited by Expressed Sequence Tags database (dbEST) in GenBank (GenBank: GE 329585 to GE 337683). Gene discovery and annotations are presented and discussed. This set of ESTs represents a significant proportion of the <b>Sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> (Cyprinodon variegatus) transcriptome, and provides a material basis for the development of microarrays useful for further gene expression studies in association with stressors such as hypoxia, cadmium, chromium and pyrene. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —We used protein {{electrophoresis}} {{to study}} the distribution of hybrids between Pecos pupfish Cyprinodon pecosensis and introduced <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> C. variegatus in the Pecos River, New Mexico-Texas. Pecos pupfish populations in New Mexico apparently are free of hybrid influence except in waters near the New Mexico-Texas state boundary. In Texas, hybrids have replaced Pecos pupfish throughout 430 km of the Pecos River and have spread into downstream areas well outside the recorded range of Pecos pupfish. Hybrids are nearly ubiquitous in waters peripheral to the river, occurring in irrigation canals, reservoirs, and water-filled, commercial gravel pits. Unintrogressed Texas populations of Pecos pupfish occur only in a small tributary of the Pecos River and in a large gravel pit. Similarities in the genetic structure of hybrid pupfish pop-ulations in the Pecos River and peripheral waters suggest that the spread of alleles characteristic of <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> has been accomplished by dispersal of hybrids, rather than by multiple introductions of <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow.</b> Loss of native fishes through hybridization with introduced species is emerging as a major chal-lenge to conservationists.

40|$|The <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> Cyprinodon variegatus {{has become}} a favoured model for {{laboratory}} studies because of their small size, rapid development, and tolerance of laboratory conditions. Here, we analyse <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> post-embryonic development {{with the goal of}} providing a generally useful method for staging fish after embryogenesis. Groups of three females and two males were placed in breeding chambers designed for this experiment. More than 100 eggs were collected and maintained in seawater.

To define a simplified normalization table for <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> development, we measured each fish for its standard length and examined the fish for four externally evident traits: pigmentation pattern, caudal fin morphology, anal fin morphology, and dorsal fin morphology.

We have provided criteria for staging sheepshead minnows in studies of post-embryonic development. Our data suggest that dorsal and anal fin morphology may serve as a useful phenotype for defining metamorphic climax stages throughout post-embryonic development in C. variegatus.

40|$|The <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow,</b> Cyprinodon variegatus, {{is found}} from Cape Cod to Mexico. Several {{subspecies}} of sheepshead have been described, but {{little is known}} about the comparative growth and reproduction of the subspecies. ^ The offspring of sheepshead minnows from two populations were reared in the laboratory for six weeks at five temperatures: 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 C. One population (C. v. variegatus) was from the Gulf coast of Florida, and the other (C. v. ovinus) was from Rhode Island. The Rhode Isalnd fish grew at a significantly greater rate (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) at 15 C than the Florida fish, but growth rates were not significantly different at the other temperatures. ^ Individuals from the two populations were crossed in the laboratory and their offspring reared through two generations (F 1 and F 2). The fish from the two populations interbred freely, and the offspring of the reciprocal crosses were as viable and fertile as those of the self-crosses. Embryos with maternal parents or grandparents from Florida hatched significantly faster than those with maternal parents or grandparents from Rhode Island. There was no significant difference between the mean lengths at hatch or the mean growth rate at 25 C of the F 2 fish from the four crosses. ^ In Rhode Island sheepshead minnows were found in the marshes from May to November, and spawn from May to September. <b>Sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> were found in marshes in Florida in all months of the year and apparently spawn there year-round.

Length and body mass, hatching success, gross morphology, thyroid hormone levels and histology were measured. The onset of metamorphosis at 12 -day post-hatching coincided with surges in whole-body T 4 and T 3 concentrations. Thyroid follicles were first observed in pre-metamorphic larvae at hatching and were detected exclusively in the subpharyngeal region, surrounding the ventral aorta. Follicle size and thyrocyte epithelial cell heights varied during development, indicating fluctuations in thyroid hormone synthesis activity. The increase in the whole-body T 3 /T 4 ratio was indicative of an increase in outer ring deiodination activity. This study establishes a baseline for thyroid hormones in sheepshead minnows, which will be useful for the understanding of thyroid hormone functions and in future studies of thyroid toxicants in this species.

40|$|Low oxygen {{tolerances}} of ten fishes {{were estimated}} using an original nitrogen cascade design, and reciprocally transformed to express responses as ventilated volume necessary to satisfy minimal oxygen demand (L·mg O 2 ^- 1). Values ranged from 0. 52 to 5. 64 L·mg^- 1 and were partitioned into three statistically distinct groups. Eight stream fishes showed moderately high tolerances reflecting metabolic adaptations associated with stream intermittency. Juvenile longear sunfish and two mollies comprised the second group. High tolerance of hypoxia may allow juvenile sunfish to avoid predation, and mollies to survive harsh environmental oxygen regimens. The <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> {{was the most}} tolerant species of low oxygen, of those examined, explaining its presence in severely hypoxic environments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Assessment of {{contaminant}} impacts to federally identified endangered, {{threatened and}} candidate, and state-identified endangered species (collectively {{referred to as}} “listed ” species) requires understanding of a species ’ sensitiv-ities to particular chemicals. The most direct approach would be to determine the sensitivity of a listed species to a particular contaminant or perturbation. An indirect approach for aquatic species would be application of toxicity data obtained from standard test procedures and species commonly used in labo-ratory toxicity tests. Common test species (fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas; <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow,</b> Cyprinodon varie-gatus; and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) and 17 listed or closely related species were tested in acute 96 -hour water exposures with five chemicals (carbaryl, copper, 4 -nonylphe-nol, pentachlorophenol, and permethrin) representing a broa...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A partial {{bibliography}} of the <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> Cyprinodon variegatus Lacipide, 1803, is presented. Sci-entific works related to systematics and general biology are listed along {{with references to}} recent work involving toxico-logical bioassays. An extensive search {{of the literature on}} parasites of C. vuriegatus was not conducted. shrimp, Artemia salina, in aquaria. Most 19 th century references listed relate to systematics or collection records of C. variegatus. A great deal of work was done on the general biology and ecology of this species from 1900 to 1965. Over the past fifteen years, however, the majority of work has documented responses of C. variegatus to environmental pollutants. Thus, it is one o f ' the few organisms for which we have a good biological data base as well as an assessment of man's potential impact on the estuarine environment...|$|E
40|$|The <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow</b> {{is widely}} used in {{ecotoxicological}} studies that recently, begin to focus on potential disruption of the thyroid axis by xenobiotics and endocrine disrupting compounds. However, reference levels of thyroxin (T 4) and 3, 5, 3 ’-triiodothyronine (T 3) and their developmental patterns are unknown. This study set out to describe the ontogeny and morphology of the thyroid gland in <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow,</b> and correlate these with whole body concentrations of thyroid hormones during early development and metamorphosis. Couples of three females and two males were placed in breeding chambers designed for this experiment. More than 1000 eggs were collected and maintained in seawater. Embryos were selected under a dissection microscope and placed in incubation dishes (50 per dish) at 25 °C. On day 6, embryos hatched and larvae were transferred to 1 L beakers. For one week after hatching, larvae were fed on artemia, and from 8 to 30 days post-hatch they were fed on flaked fish food. Embryos were sampled on day 0, 3, 6 post-fertilization and larvae and juveniles were sampled every three days from day 0 to 28 days post-hatch. The pooled samples were taken from several incubation dishes and divided in three replicate batches of 10 - 30 individuals. T 4 and T 3 were extracted from whole fish bodies and an enzyme-linked immunoassay {{was used to measure}} whole-body hormone levels. At each sampling point 5 individuals were placed in formalin fixative for histology. Length and body mass were measured. Hatching success, gross morphology, thyroid hormone levels and histology data were recorded. The onset of metamorphosis at 12 days post-hatching coincided with surges in whole body T 4 and T 3 concentrations. Thyroid follicles were first observed in pre-metamorphic larvae at hatching, and were detected exclusively in the subpharyngeal region, surrounding the ventral aorta. Follicle size and epithelial cell heights varied during the developmental phase, indicating fluctuations in thyroid hormone synthesis activity. The increase in the whole body T 3 /T 4 ratio was indicative of an increase in outer ring deiodination. This study establishes a baseline for thyroid hormones in sheepshead minnows, which will be vital for the understanding of thyroid hormone functions and in future studies of thyroid toxicants in this species.

40|$|Linear {{relationships}} of the median lethal concentrations of several hundreds of chemicals {{for a variety}} of organisms with Vibrio fischeri median effective concentrations are investigated. Significant correlations can be developed for many aquatic species including the fishes fathead minnow, bluegill, catfish, goldfish, goldorfe, guppy, killifish, rainbow trout, <b>sheepshead</b> <b>minnow,</b> and zebrafish; the water flea Daphnia sp.; such crustaceans as Artemia sp. and Crangon sp.; the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis; and algae, such as Chlorella sp. These interspecies relationships can be used to estimate order-of-magnitude type toxic effects of many substances for these aquatic organisms. Highly significant relationships can be obtained when selecting compounds on a chemical basis, such as alcohols, ketones, aromatics, etc., which allow the calculation of the compounds ' toxicities to the corresponding aquatic species with increased accuracy and confidence. Analogous correlations with mammalian (rat and mouse) oral, intraperitoneal, and intravenous median lethal dose (LD 50) data are much weaker than those for most aquatic species. However, there are significant differences between these three routes of administration and the intravenous LD 50 data show the best relationship with the Vibrio data. Environ Health Perspec...|$|E
