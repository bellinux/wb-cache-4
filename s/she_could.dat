5|$|After Liliʻuokalani {{was imprisoned}} in the ʻIolani Palace, she was denied {{literature}} and newspapers, essentially cutting her {{off from her}} people.

60|$|<b>Could</b> <b>she</b> kiss them? <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> be blithe {{and cheerful}} in her parting? <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> venture {{to reveal her}} face to them without a blush? Yes. Tackleton {{observed}} her closely, and she did all this.|$|R
6000|$|Laverick drank {{his wine}} slowly. The woman knew! Impossible! Her eyes were {{watching}} his face, {{but he held}} himself bravely. What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> know? How <b>could</b> <b>she</b> guess? ...|$|R
6000|$|She rode forward, flushing. What dared <b>she</b> say? <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> {{speak of}} her wedding, and betray Miltoun's presence? <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> open her mouth at all without rousing painful feeling of some sort? Then, {{impatient}} of indecision, she began: ...|$|R
5|$|After {{one hour}} of jury deliberation, Wise {{was found guilty of}} first-degree murder. The jury urged mercy in sentencing, and the judge {{sentence}}d Wise to a life sentence in prison, under the terms of which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only be freed by executive clemency.|$|E

5|$|Camden County Coroner Robert J. Blake ruled {{her death}} an accident; {{a case of}} {{starvation}} with exposure as a contributing factor. A spokesman for the coroner said Barker became trapped in the closet, and died of fright and starvation. Due to {{a hole in the}} closet, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not have suffocated.|$|E
60|$|<b>She?</b> What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> see, save {{what all}} women see--that they only are real, {{and that all}} the rest are dreams.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not. Why should <b>she?</b> Whom <b>could</b> <b>she</b> talk to?" [...] Yet {{he stopped}} suddenly, {{and then with}} his {{characteristic}} reaction added, with a laugh, [...] "Why no, certainly not." ...|$|R

60|$|Patty {{went downstairs}} and {{stood for a}} moment in the hall, rapt in reflection. If she had been at home, she verily {{believed}} she would have sat down and cried. Oh, it was too bad, too disappointing! Clifford would certainly lose all chance of the permanency, even if the irate news editor did not discharge him at once. What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> do? <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> do anything? She must do something.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think you've {{any right}} to put such a {{responsibility}} on her. She has enough to bear. <b>She</b> is poor--how <b>could</b> <b>she</b> afford such an operation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I saw Mr. Pike nod {{his head}} grimly and sarcastically. He {{had already seen}} it from the lee-poop, {{and what he had}} not seen he had guessed. A score of times I saw him test the weight of the gusts on his cheek and with all the brain of him study the Elsinore's behaviour. And I knew what was in his mind. <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> carry what <b>she</b> had? <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> carry more? ...|$|R
5|$|Her son was {{diagnosed}} with autism {{at the age of}} three.

5|$|In May 1941, the Air Force {{appointed}} McKenzie as {{an honorary}} flight {{officer of the}} Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> legitimately instruct Air Force personnel.

5|$|In {{classical}} Athenian marriages, {{husband or}} wife could legally initiate a divorce. The woman's closest male relative (who {{would be her}} kyrios if she were not married) could also do so, apparently even against the couple's wishes. After divorce, the husband was required to return the dowry or pay 18 percent interest annually so the woman's livelihood would continue and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> remarry. If there were children {{at the time of}} the divorce, they remained in their father's house and he remained responsible for their upbringing. If a woman committed adultery, her husband was legally required to divorce her. A married epikleros would be divorced so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> marry her nearest relative.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{could not}} give you my life, so I have brought you my death!" [...] Those were her words. What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> mean--what <b>could</b> it all mean? I must know or I would go mad. There it lay, {{whatever}} it was, wrapped up in linen.|$|R
6000|$|... "So!" [...] he cried. [...] "Would that be why {{she refused}} to see me? Did she {{conceive}} that I went perhaps to plead? <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> think that? <b>Could</b> she?" ...|$|R
5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be based in Sapporo where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be close to her family and friends, {{as well as to}} I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she felt that she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E
5|$|McEntire {{was a guest}} {{judge on}} the July 13, 2016 episode of America's Got Talent. She used her golden buzzer, which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only use once and allowed an act to go {{straight}} to the live shows, on contortionist Sofie Dossi.|$|E

6000|$|There shut {{up in his}} castle, Tairiran's, [...] She who had nor ears nor tongue save in her hands, [...] Gone, ah, gone--untouched, unreachable! [...] <b>She</b> who <b>could</b> {{never live}} save through one person, [...] <b>She</b> who <b>could</b> never speak save to one person, [...] And {{all the rest of}} her a {{shifting}} change, [...] A broken bundle of mirrors...! ...|$|R
60|$|What would <b>she</b> {{have said}} <b>could</b> <b>she</b> {{have heard the}} {{conversation}} that was passing in her brother's study? Little <b>could</b> <b>she</b> dream that the mystery, about which she had timidly nibbled for years, was now about to be unrolled;--but it was even so. But, upon what she does not see, good reader, you and I, following invisibly on tiptoe, will make our observations.|$|R
6000|$|And yet, <b>could</b> <b>she</b> deny him? <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> say, [...] "I {{refuse to}} content this pining hunger?" [...] It would be refusing {{to do for}} him dead, what she was almost sure to do for him living. If he lived as Lydgate had said he might, for fifteen years or more, her life would {{certainly}} be spent in helping him and obeying him.|$|R
5|$|Roanoke, {{named after}} the Roanoke River, was laid down at the Norfolk Navy Yard in May 1854 and {{launched}} on 13 December 1855. The ship sank when launched {{and had to be}} refloated before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be completed. She was commissioned on 4 May 1857 with Captain John B. Montgomery in command.|$|E
5|$|She {{lived in}} the United States from 2006 to 2008, {{with the goal of}} {{improving}} the quality of her water polo play so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> qualify for the Olympics. In late 2010, she injured her arm and it took time to recover.|$|E
5|$|She was {{defeated}} {{the minute she}} tried to do it, because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not sell the people of California {{that she would be}} a better fighter against communism than Dick Nixon. She made the fatal mistake of attacking our strength instead of sticking to attacking our weakness.|$|E
60|$|Elfride {{swallowed}} {{her feelings}} as <b>she</b> best <b>could,</b> and languidly though flatly asked a question.|$|R
60|$|It was enough. The dancer's {{response}} told passionately, without words, what <b>she</b> never <b>could</b> have said.|$|R
