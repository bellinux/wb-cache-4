5|$|John Calvin was {{influenced}} by Martin Luther's idea of baptism as God's promises to the baptized person attached to the outward <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> washing with water. Calvin maintained Zwingli's idea of baptism as a public pledge, but insisted that it was secondary to baptism's meaning as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> God's promise to forgive sin. He maintained that sacraments were effective instruments in bringing about the promises they represent, however he also maintained that the promises could be refused by the baptized, and would have no effect in that case. Calvin carefully distinguished between the outward <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the washing of water with the promises that baptism signifies while maintaining that they were inseparable. Calvin's baptismal theology {{is very similar to}} that of Luther. It differs in the way Calvin subordinated sacraments to the preaching of the word of God. While Luther placed preaching and sacraments on the same level, Calvin saw sacraments as confirmation which is added to the preaching of the word of God.|$|E
