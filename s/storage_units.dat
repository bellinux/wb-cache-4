5|$|German {{intelligence}} {{suggested that}} the RAF was down to just 300 serviceable fighters on 17 August 1940, taking into consideration German pilots' claims and their estimates of British production capabilities. In fact, there were 855 machines serviceable, with another 289 at <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> and 84 at training units. These resources were included {{in a total of}} 1,438 fighters, twice as many as at the beginning of July 1940. Expecting weakening opposition, the Luftwaffe prepared for a major action against RAF Sector Stations on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|Some {{specialized}} {{types of}} oil tankers have evolved. One {{of these is}} the naval replenishment oiler, a tanker which can fuel a moving vessel. Combination ore-bulk-oil carriers and permanently moored floating <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> are two other variations on the standard oil tanker design. Oil tankers have been involved in a number of damaging and high-profile oil spills. As a result, they are subject to stringent design and operational regulations.|$|E
5|$|Barges {{were also}} used to {{transport}} ice, particularly along the Hudson River, doubling on occasion as <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> as well. These barges could carry between 400 and 800 tons (400,000 to 800,000kg) of ice and, like ice carrying ships, windmills were typically installed to power the barge's bilge pumps. Barges were believed to help preserve ice from melting, as the ice was stored beneath the deck and insulated by the river. Charlie Morse introduced larger, seagoing ice barges in the 1890s in order to supply New York; these were pulled by schooners and could each carry up to 3,000 tons (three million kg) of ice.|$|E

After he finished raping {{her for the first}} time he left her naked in the structure, which he bolted shut, warning her that Doberman Pinschers were outside and trained to attack her if she tried to escape. Garrido would visit her in the structure, bringing her food and milkshakes, and talking to her.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{construction}} on the Central Arizona Project (CAP) began while many of its facilities were still being planned and approved. One {{integral part of the}} project was a storage dam on the Salt River, Orme Dam. However, in 1977, US President Jimmy Carter recommended that Orme Dam and two other projects on the Gila River System be removed from the CAP plan because of their negative impacts and cost. While the two other projects (Hooker and Charleston Dam) were easily removed, Orme was not. Orme's removal was hampered by controversy that {{led to the creation of}} the Central Arizona Water Control Study (CAWCS) in 1979 after Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus requested that the Bureau of Reclamation identify a replacement. In 1980, the CAWCS recommended the removal of any <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> on the Gila River. Recent flooding within the CAWCS area and the Orme Dam problem led to an expansion of the study to include dams for flood control.|$|E
5|$|Many Public Storage {{customers}} have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau regarding insurance policies sold by Public Storage representatives, after experiencing burglaries of their <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> then having their insurance claims denied. Investigative journalists from TV news stations in California, Kansas, and Washington have reported on difficulties consumers had when filing insurance claims for burglaries with Willis and The New Hampshire Insurance Company, which are affiliated with Public Storage. For example, claims {{have been denied}} because the storage unit had an intact lock; affiliated insurance companies cited insufficient evidence of forced entry, though burglars often replace the unit's lock {{in an attempt to}} conceal the burglary. Insurance commissioners in two states have criticized the practices of insurance companies affiliated with Public Storage. An ongoing class action lawsuit alleges Public Storage misleads consumers into thinking that insurance premiums are charged at cost, whereas a substantial amount of those premiums are retained as profits by Public Storage. Sales of these insurance policies do have a high profit, but generate less than five percent of the company's total revenue.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper aims to {{investigate}} the sizing of an offshore energy <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> operated in conjunction with an offshore wind farm. The <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> is evaluated with technical limitations to reveal the parameter sensitivities when coupled with a wind farm. The main interest is the sizing of the <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> for capacity firming purposes. A <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> in combination with a large offshore wind farm has been simulated in time domain {{over the course of}} one year. The <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> has been operated with the goal of firming the wind power capacity within each bid period. Different constraints have been introduced to show parameter sensitivity of the <b>storage</b> <b>unit.</b> The constraints were both technical and control oriented. An important prerequisite for the simulation was that the combined wind power plant and the storage operate in a market where the imbalance between bid and delivered energy is measured and penalized. Results show that there are several important parameters regarding storage sizing. Storage sizing is shown to be very dependent on the production forecast error and market bid length. Furthermore, technical constraints in the shape of ramping rates and power reversal dead time can be countered by choosing an appropriate control strategy. No control strategy gives significantly more reduction in grid power imbalance than the constant, fixed mode control strategy. The same reduction can however be obtained, with somewhat less energy routed through the storage by applying an alternative control strategy...|$|R

25|$|In 1962 the IBM350 RAMAC {{disk storage}} unit was {{superseded}} by the IBM1301 {{disk storage unit}}, which consisted of 50 platters, each about 1/8-inch thick and 24 inches in diameter. Whereas the IBM350 used only two read/write heads which were pneumatically actuated and moved in two dimensions, the 1301 {{was one of the}} first disk <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> to use an array of heads, one per platter, moving as a single unit. Cylinder-mode read/write operations were supported, and the heads flew about 250 micro-inches (about 6µm) above the platter surface. Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning. The 1301 cabinet was about the size of three home refrigerators placed side by side, storing the equivalent of about 21 million eight-bit bytes. Access time was about a quarter of a second.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} cylinder boxes have a plain {{brown paper}} exterior, sometimes rubber-stamped {{with the company}} name. By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around {{the outside of the}} box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. A slip of paper stating the title and performer was placed inside the box with the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost. The recording itself usually began with a spoken announcement of the title and performer and also the name of the record company. On a typical Edison record slip from 1903, the consumer is invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information and paste it onto the lid of the box. Alternatively, a circular area within the coupon could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such <b>storage</b> <b>units,</b> however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped on the lid, then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.|$|E
