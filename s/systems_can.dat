5|$|A general {{application}} of matrices in physics {{is to the}} description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The equations of motion of such <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> be described in matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions {{is to determine the}} system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E

5|$|Chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems also exist, some {{of which}} perform cell {{functions}} such as responding to stresses, causing cell cycle arrest and bringing about programmed cell death. In evolutionary terms, toxin-antitoxin <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> be considered selfish DNA in {{that the purpose of}} the systems are to replicate, regardless of whether they benefit the host organism or not. Some have proposed adaptive theories to explain the evolution of toxin-antitoxin systems; for example, chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems could have evolved to prevent the inheritance of large deletions of the host genome. Toxin-antitoxin systems have several biotechnological applications, such as a method of maintaining plasmids in cell lines, targets for antibiotics, and as positive selection vectors.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlers}} and property owners {{contributed to the}} development of the city, and many families and individuals are remembered in street names. Streets laid out when Utica was a village had more irregularities than those built later in the 19th and 20thcenturies. As a result of the city's location (adjacent to the Mohawk River), many streets parallel the river, so they do not run strictly east-west or north–south. Remnants of Utica's early electric-rail <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> be seen in the West and South neighborhoods, where the rails were set into the streets.|$|E
5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that biological <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|Ensuring a plasmid accepts {{an insert}} {{is a common}} problem of DNA cloning. Toxin-antitoxin <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> be used to {{positively}} select for only those cells that have taken up a plasmid containing the inserted gene of interest, screening out those that lack the inserted gene. An example of this application comes from CcdB-encoded toxin, which has been incorporated into plasmid vectors. The gene of interest is then targeted to recombine into the CcdB locus, inactivating the transcription of the toxic protein. Thus, cells containing the plasmid but not the insert perish due to the toxic effects of CcdB protein, and only those that incorporate the insert survive.|$|E
5|$|Human {{language}} is also unique {{in being able}} to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events {{that took place in the}} past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> use displacement (such as the communication of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human {{language is}} also considered unique.|$|E
5|$|The LU {{decomposition}} factors matrices as {{a product}} of lower (L) and an upper triangular matrices (U). Once this decomposition is calculated, linear <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> be solved more efficiently, by a simple technique called forward and back substitution. Likewise, inverses of triangular matrices are algorithmically easier to calculate. The Gaussian elimination is a similar algorithm; it transforms any matrix to row echelon form. Both methods proceed by multiplying the matrix by suitable elementary matrices, which correspond to permuting rows or columns and adding multiples of one row to another row. Singular value decomposition expresses any matrix A {{as a product}} UDV∗, where U and V are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix.|$|E

5|$|The {{energy in}} {{sunlight}} is captured by plants, cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria and some protists.

Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees.
