5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as heirlooms owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added {{to that part of}} the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. It is not possible to <b>say</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the collection is worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold on the open market.|$|E
5|$|During December 2011, GM {{conducted}} four crash {{tests of}} Volts with the reinforced steel and upgraded cooling system, resulting in no intrusion to the battery and no coolant leakage. On December 22, 2011, the NHTSA also subjected a modified Volt {{to the same}} test {{that led to the}} original fire, with no signs of the damage that {{is believed to have been}} the cause. The NHTSA said “the preliminary results of the crash test indicate the remedy proposed by General Motors today should address the issue of battery intrusion” though its investigation remained open. General Motors declined to <b>say</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the modifications would cost.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} other {{difficulties}} in researching {{the effects of}} cannabis. Many people who smoke cannabis also smoke tobacco. This causes confounding factors, where questions arise {{as to whether the}} tobacco, the cannabis, or both that have caused a cancer. Another difficulty researchers have is in recruiting people who smoke cannabis into studies. Because cannabis is an illegal drug in many countries, people may be reluctant to take part in research, and if they do agree to take part, they may not <b>say</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> cannabis they actually smoke.|$|E

25|$|The {{greatest}} indigenous {{influence on}} the Jindyworobaks was literature which had been taken down by white folklorists and anthropologists. Written, as opposed to transcribed, indigenous literature did not appear in print until the 1920s when David Unaipon, a Christian from Point McLeay mission, South Australia, published {{a large body of}} work. Unaipon was publishing into the 1950s, by which time the Jindyworobaks were in decline. Unaipon was the sole published Indigenous Australian writer during their heyday, and indeed {{it was not until the}} 1960s that a second was published - Oodgeroo Noonuccal (Kath Walker). Unaipon, despite coming from South Australia, is not mentioned in the works of the Jindyworobaks, so it is hard to <b>say</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of an influence, Legendary Tales of the Australian Aborigines was.|$|E

25|$|On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further {{expanded}} the collateral it will loan against to include commercial paper {{using the new}} Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for non-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they'll buy {{as much of the}} debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to <b>say</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> that might be, but they noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was $1.61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market as of October 1, 2008, {{according to the most recent}} data from the Fed. That was down from $1.70 trillion in the previous week. Since the summer of 2007, the market has shrunk from more than $2.2 trillion. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. Forty-five out of 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.|$|E

Field notes indicate that while several major artifacts, including baskets, sandals, painted wood fragments, digging sticks, arrow heads, and crushed pots were found at the great house, the whereabouts of most of these items is [...] "one of the great archaeological mysteries of the Southwest". He ascribes the [...] "almost total disappearance" [...] of the Chetro Ketl artifacts, which were viewed as unimpressive in comparison to those found at Pueblo Bonito, {{as a consequence of}} Hewett's flippant treatment of the collection. The Museum of New Mexico holds several items excavated from Chetro Ketl, including pieces of turquoise, a black-on-white pottery canteen, and a fourteen-foot-long stone and shell necklace.|$|E

500|$|In a November {{session of}} the Federation Council, Putin stated that {{establishing}} the national symbols (anthem, flag and coat of arms) should be a top priority for the country. Putin pressed for the former Soviet anthem to be selected as the new Russian anthem, but strongly suggested that new lyrics be written. He did not <b>say</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the old Soviet lyrics should be retained for the new anthem. Putin submitted the bill [...] "On the National Anthem of the Russian Federation" [...] to the Duma for their consideration on 4 December. The Duma voted 381–51–1 in favor of adopting Alexandrov's music as the national anthem on 8 December 2000. Following the vote, a committee was formed and tasked with exploring lyrics for the national anthem. After receiving over 6,000 manuscripts from all sectors of Russian society, the committee selected lyrics by Mikhalkov for the anthem.|$|E

500|$|Although some British {{thought that}} Allenby should replace Chauvel with a British officer, Allenby {{retained}} him in command. However he overrode Chauvel's own preference {{to appoint a}} Royal Horse Guards officer, Brigadier General Richard Howard-Vyse, known as [...] "Wombat", as Chauvel's chief of staff. Chauvel thus, on 2 August 1917, became the first Australian to permanently command a corps. A [...] "brass-bound brigadier" [...] was quoted as saying, [...] "Fancy giving the command of the biggest mounted force in the world's history to an Australian." [...] On being told of the appointments, in a letter dated 12 August 1917 Chetwode wrote to congratulate Chauvel, [...] "I cannot <b>say</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I envy you the command of the largest body of mounted men ever under one hand – it is my own trade – but Fate has willed it otherwise." [...] At Romani Chauvel had been a battleground commander who led from the front while Chetwode, relying on the phone had been deciding to retreat at the victory at Rafa. Chetwode's [...] "arms length" [...] style of command also impacted the First Battle of Gaza.|$|E

500|$|The video {{starts with}} [...] "Let Me Talk to You" [...] as the {{background}} is surrounded by faulty fluorescent lighting, turning on and off in a programmed pattern. It also begins with Timberlake and Timbaland chanting [...] "hey" [...] to one another. The video proceeds with Timberlake dancing {{to the beat of}} the song. Timbaland then begins singing the first verse of the song, which then is proceeded by Timberlake. This is immediately followed with [...] "My Love" [...] playing; the first verse of the song, [...] "Ain't another woman that could take your spot my", plays. Timberlake comes floating toward the camera, down the faulty fluorescent tube. Once Timberlake stops floating, he begins singing the main verse of the song, which violins begin to float swirling gently around him, for [...] "If I wrote you a symphony / Just to <b>say</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you mean to me". The scene then changes with Timberlake and various dancers dancing accordingly in a choreographed style. When Timberlake begins the second verse, [...] "Now if I wrote you a love note / And made you smile at every word I wrote", pens and paper begin to float. This later exceeds with Timberlake singing [...] "This ring here represents my heart" [...] with a ring swirling into the camera. T.I. is then seen in the shot. T.I. begins rapping his lines in the song. After T.I. finishes his verse, Timberlake is then seen dancing with a female back-up dancer. Though, as they continue dancing, the female then leaves the shot, leaving Timberlake to dance {{to the end of the}} song. In the closing moments, the camera swirls around him, proving, conclusively, from every angle, that everyone has gone.|$|E
