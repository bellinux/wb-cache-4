This merged with the Board of Taxes in 1833/34, and the Board of Inland Revenue was created under the Inland Revenue Board Act 1849 by merger of the Board of Excise and Board of Stamps and Taxes. <b>Stamp</b> <b>taxes</b> were then {{administered by the}} Inland Revenue <b>Stamp</b> <b>Taxes</b> business stream (formerly the Stamp Office). Another merger occurred in 2004, when the Inland Revenue and HM Customs & Excise formed HM Revenue & Customs which now itself manages stamp duty.|$|E

The government derives its revenue from import tariffs, VAT, licence fees, property and <b>stamp</b> <b>taxes,</b> {{but there is no}} income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 3.9% paid by the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer. In 2010, overall tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.2%.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the federal}} {{government}} formerly imposed various documentary <b>stamp</b> <b>taxes</b> on deeds, notes, insurance premiums and other transactional documents, in modern times such taxes are only imposed by states. Typically when real estate is transferred or sold, a real estate transfer tax will be collected {{at the time of}} registration of the deed in the public records. In addition, many states impose a tax on mortgages or other instruments securing loans against real property. This tax, known variously as a mortgage tax, intangibles tax, or documentary stamp tax, is also usually collected at the time of registration of the mortgage or deed of trust with the recording authority.|$|E
50|$|A {{separate}} Board of Stamps {{was created}} by the Stamps Act 1694. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries at various points as financial strains on the economy demanded, and Parliament allowed, stamp duties were extended above a certain threshold of sale value to cover newspapers, pamphlets, lottery tickets, apprentices' indentures, advertisements, playing cards, dice, hats, gloves, patent medicines, perfumes, insurance policies, gold and silver plate and armorial bearings (coats of arms). One further category is the most widely cited example of an unpopular and most difficult to enforce tax, the Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795. The last <b>stamp</b> <b>taxes</b> to remain are stamp duty land tax and stamp duty reserve tax however stamping has ceased in favour of numerical certificates.|$|E

50|$|The Revenue Act of 1862 placed {{taxes on}} the {{majority}} of items available for retail and consumption. Among the items taxed were many luxury and sin items including, but not limited to, liquor, tobacco, playing cards, gunpowder, feathers, telegrams, iron, leather, pianos, yachts, carriages, billiard tables, and jewelry. More importantly, the federal government placed taxes on many services and public goods as well. Other taxed items included patented medicines, newspaper advertisements, <b>stamp</b> <b>taxes,</b> inheritance taxes, taxes on licenses for all services and professions (with the exception of clergy), and value added taxes on manufactured goods and processed meats. One particular new tax required that corporations, banks, trust companies, savings institutions, and insurance companies report their finances, including receipts and interest earned, so that these could be taxed as well. The majority of these taxes and tariffs were consumer-oriented, and affected lower-income Americans more severely than the higher-income Americans. To reinforce {{the fairness of the}} system, Congress implemented a supplementary system of taxation via a new income tax.|$|E
50|$|Other {{than for}} Holland (for which more data are known) revenue {{figures for the}} Republic as a whole are {{available}} for 1716, when it amounted to 32.5 million guilders, and again for 1792 (when the repartitie-system was revised for the first time), {{when it came to}} 40.5 million (inflated) guilders. After 1795 the Batavian Republic collected regular revenue statistics. These figures allow the following observations: in 1790 the per-capita tax burden at the national level in the Republic was comparable to that in Great Britain, and twice that in France (which had just started a revolution about that tax burden). This reflected a rapid rise in tax burdens in both France and Great Britain during the 18th century in which both countries made up a large difference with the Republic (but also in income levels, of course). Extrapolating backward, the Dutch level of taxation in 1720 probably was double that of Britain. Dutch innovations like excises and <b>stamp</b> <b>taxes</b> were followed with a lag of a century in the larger countries.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the enthusiasm of some observers for sweeping reforms to financial sector taxation (such as abolishing taxation of capital income or introducing a universal transactions tax), this paper argues that practical policy needs to {{pay special attention to}} the potential for tax arbitrage, and to avoiding a system that is too sensitive to inflation. A review of the main features of Chile's financial sector taxation regime (in particular the <b>stamp</b> <b>taxes</b> on checks and on loans) against this background shows some strengths, though the rates are somewhat higher than would result from a VAT applied systematically to financial services at the standard rate. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} tax {{factors in}} 21 developing {{countries that have}} an impact on foreign direct investment flows. It categorizes those factors into issues associated with tax coordination; tax rates and rate structures; and composition of the tax base. Recent actions by countries reveal no clear pattern in their attempts to increase tax coordination, while many have reduced corporate tax rates and stream-lined tax incentives. However, broad-based tax reform is lacking in most, leaving room for further possibilities in tax reform for attracting foreign investment. The paper also addresses nontax factors that can be instrumental in attracting foreign investment.
