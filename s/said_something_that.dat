25|$|This is {{a series}} of vignettes recounting a social {{occasion}} during which someone <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> should not have been said, or an awkward occurrence. The participant's task is to identify what was said that was awkward, why it was awkward, how people would have felt in reaction to the faux pas and to a factual control question. Although first designed for use in people on the autism spectrum, the test is also sensitive to patients with OFC dysfunction, who cannot judge when something socially awkward has happened despite appearing to understand the story perfectly well.|$|E
2500|$|... "Even {{before we}} flew the X-1, I {{talked to him}} at great length about ‘what are we getting into? You know, what's it mean? We're going to be fooling around out of my realm…and you may {{understand}} this stuff but I don't. What the hell are we getting into?' And Jack would patiently explain. And I {{had a great deal}} of confidence in him and, you know, if he <b>said</b> <b>something,</b> <b>that,</b> to me, was from the Bible. You could take it to the bank." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hillary Clinton {{described}} the remarks as [...] "elitist, out of touch, and frankly patronizing." [...] Noting {{he had not}} chosen his words well, Obama subsequently explained his remarks, [...] "Lately {{there has been a}} little typical sort of political flare-up, because I <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> everybody knows is true, which {{is that there are a}} whole bunch of folks in small towns in Pennsylvania, in towns right here in Indiana, in my hometown in Illinois, who are bitter." [...] Obama had addressed similar themes in a 2004 interview with Charlie Rose, and his strategists countered that Bill Clinton had made similar comments in 1991.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{returned}} Nigel, with a laugh; [...] "you {{at least}} gave {{me to understand}} <b>that</b> other people <b>said</b> <b>something</b> of <b>that</b> sort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad you've come, Luke," [...] he <b>said,</b> with <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{sounded like}} a sigh. [...] "The doctor tells me I cannot last long." ...|$|R
5000|$|Oriah's Story, who {{explains}} that he became violent and, in a rage, assaulted his mother. He <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> like <b>that</b> you can't take back, and can't forgive himself for doing said action.|$|R
2500|$|The S.T.A.R. Labs {{facility}} where the heroes initially meet {{was made to}} look like the Hall of Justice from the Super Friends animated series. Guggenheim noted, [...] "We were talking about where to put —we were talking about maybe it was an old warehouse or whatever. Someone <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> made me think, 'You know, there's this building in Cincinnati that is the basis for the Hall of Justice in the Super Friends. I'm sure there's stock footage that we could then alter.' That's what we ended up doing... Props to Encore who did an amazing job of altering it in all the right ways. Putting the waterpool in the front and the sculptures".|$|E
2500|$|On July 2, 1778, Lee was court-martialled at Brunswick, New Jersey {{by a jury}} presided by Lord Stirling {{on three}} charges: 1. disobedience of orders in not attacking the enemy; 2. misbehavior before the enemy in making an unnecessary, disorderly, and shameful retreat; 3. disrespect to the commander-in-chief. Lee was found guilty, and he was {{relieved}} of command {{for a period of}} one year. (In his Narrative, Joseph Plumb Martin recounted that Washington rode up during the retreat and asked Martin's officers [...] "by whose order the troops [...] retreating". [...] He was told that it was [...] "by Gen. Lee's", and he <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Martin wasn't close enough to hear. Martin was told later by those who had been close enough that Washington had said [...] "damn him!" [...] as he rode off, which Martin found unusual but plausible since Washington had been [...] "in a great passion" [...] because of the retreat.) ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E
60|$|Leger <b>said</b> <b>something</b> viciously <b>that</b> was {{not very}} distinct, while Hetty sat still a moment glancing at the paper without {{touching}} it, and then gravely held out her hand.|$|R
60|$|THE STATUE. Ha ha! Do you {{remember}} how I frightened you when I <b>said</b> <b>something</b> like <b>that</b> to you from my pedestal in Seville? It sounds rather flat without my trombones.|$|R
6000|$|... “You’re to be envied {{when you}} sail away,” Mrs. Jaques <b>said,</b> with <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{was almost a}} sigh. “Still, it isn’t all {{sunshine}} and smooth water in the North.” ...|$|R
60|$|She {{shook her}} head emphatically, and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> I failed to catch.|$|E
6000|$|Tommy did {{not hear}} Boris's reply, but in {{response}} to it Whittington <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> sounded like: [...] "Of course--only in an emergency...." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Durgin's speech {{had been}} {{thickening}} more and more. She now <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Jeff could not understand. He looked involuntarily at Cynthia.|$|E
6000|$|She looked {{round at}} him. [...] "You <b>said</b> <b>something</b> like <b>that</b> {{when you were}} delirious," [...] she answered, after a little pause. [...] "It's one of the ideas that you're {{struggling}} with. You go on, old man, and talk. We've months--for repetitions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{said his}} sister, [...] "I {{strongly}} suspect something {{wrong about the}} boys. Fergus was very odd and silent last night when I asked him about Jem Horner's picnic, and he <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about <b>that</b> Harewood cousin being an unmitigated brute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His father?" [...] he said, {{lifting his}} eyebrows. [...] "No. Oh! I remember, I <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to <b>that</b> effect the other night, {{but it was}} a mistake. I mixed up two names, as one often does after a lapse of many years." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{she put on}} {{coat and}} hat, jamming her hat down on her head, and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Cissie did not {{immediately}} understand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jack dear, I like him, but he <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was true. I {{should never}} have {{fallen in love with}} the real Cyril Jernyngham." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{man made}} several efforts to answer, and finally <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> to Alfred sounded like [...] "Zane," [...] then {{he fell to}} the ground unconscious.|$|E
60|$|He <b>said</b> <b>something</b> further <b>that</b> Graham {{could not}} hear, {{and a little}} phial was handed across to him. Graham felt a cooling spray, a {{fragrant}} mist played over his forehead for a moment, and his sense of refreshment increased. He closed his eyes in satisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|And I'd {{know why}} papa {{shut the door}} with a slam, [...] And <b>said</b> <b>something</b> funny <b>that</b> sounded like [...] "jam," [...] And then [...] "Edith--where are you?" [...] I said, [...] "Here I am." [...] "Ah, that's right, dear, look out of the window!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hem--hem--hem!" [...] said Touchwood, hesitating. [...] "I {{am sorry}} your ears have served you so well--something there was <b>said</b> lightly, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{can be easily}} explained, I dare say;--And now, Mr. Mowbray, let me speak a few serious words with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Katharine, you ARE in love!" [...] {{at which}} Katharine flushed, looked startled, {{as if she}} had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> she ought not to have said, and shook her head.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look like}} it." [...] Gordon smiled. [...] "As it happened, I saw Miss Waynefleet {{crossing}} the clearing. It {{occurs to me}} that she may have <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> set you thinking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's what I {{tried to}} hint. You {{can count on}} my {{recommendation}} when it's likely to be of use, but you <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was rather illuminating. You want to use your judgment?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, true, uncle--I had forgot that," [...] exclaimed the {{volatile}} Hector; [...] "but you <b>said</b> <b>something</b> just now <b>that</b> put {{everything out of}} my head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] almost shrieked Miss Fane. [...] "Stop one second; an effort, and I must be well; {{nothing has}} happened, {{and no one}} has done or said anything; but it is of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> should be <b>said,</b> of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> should be done, that I was thinking, and it overcame me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were going}} into the law, weren't you?" [...] I asked. [...] "I {{remember}} you <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about it <b>that</b> day we met at Beverly Farms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{really believe}} Tom was half sorry he couldn't do so last night. He <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{suggested}} it. I don't understand much about these matters, but Howitson was here, talking business, until late." ...|$|E
6000|$|Chatteris <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> struck Melville {{as having}} somehow been said before. [...] "Election, progress, good of humanity, public spirit. None {{of these things}} {{interest}} me really," [...] he said. [...] "At least, not just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} attempt {{to live on}} you, sir!" [...] This was spoken with some vivacity by our young man; he felt the next moment that he had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> might provoke a retort. But his {{companion}} showed no sharpness.|$|E
60|$|Hereat she <b>said</b> <b>something</b> so {{improper}} <b>that</b> it shocked even Binkie, who was dribbling patiently on {{the landing}} {{with the hope of}} seeing his master again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{join you}} on the trail," [...] said Dillon, who remarked that Stannard implied that he hesitated to go. Stannard had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> like <b>that</b> before, {{as if he wanted}} others to note that the plan was not his. All the same, it was not important, and Dillon took Laura's hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I {{not told}} you already," [...] {{answered}} Sir Mungo, [...] "that the king <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to <b>that</b> effect--so did the Prince too;--and such being the case, ye may {{take it on}} your corporal oath, that every man in the circle who was not silent, sung the same song as they did." ...|$|R
