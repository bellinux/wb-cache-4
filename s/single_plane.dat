5|$|Wolfenstein 3D was {{the second}} major release by id Software, after the Commander Keen series of episodes. In mid-1991, {{programmer}} John Carmack experimented with making a fast 3D game engine by restricting the gameplay and viewpoint to a <b>single</b> <b>plane,</b> producing Hovertank 3D and Catacomb 3-D as prototypes. After a design session prompted the company to shift from the family-friendly Keen to a more violent theme, programmer John Romero suggested remaking the 1981 stealth shooter Castle Wolfenstein as a fast-paced action game. He and designer Tom Hall designed the game, built on Carmack's engine, to be fast and violent, unlike other computer games on the market at the time. Wolfenstein 3D features artwork by Adrian Carmack and sound effects and music by Bobby Prince. The game was released through Apogee in two sets of three episodes under the shareware model, in which the first episode is released for free to drive interest in paying for the rest. An additional episode, Spear of Destiny, was released as a stand-alone retail title through FormGen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cable-stayed {{bridge with}} <b>single</b> cable <b>plane</b> has {{advantages}} in wide field of view. However, {{the problem of}} stability becomes especially important, because it can’t provide torsional stiffness. Based on LanQi SongHua River Bridge, a concrete cable-stayed bridge with <b>single</b> cable <b>plane,</b> the dynamic character, wind-resistant stability and flutter instability are analyzed, especially {{the analysis of the}} flutter stability at maximum double cantilever stage during construction phase. The paper analyzes the dynamic characters of the finite element model of the whole bridge through response spectrum method to reap the natural frequency, the vibration modes and other parameters, then checking the flutter stability. The results show that the bridge is very safe either at maximum double cantilever stage or finished stage. The analysis method provides a basis and references for the wind-resistant of cable-stayed bridge with <b>single</b> cable <b>plane...</b>|$|R

Echocardiography equipment has developed from bulky laboratory equipment to portable battery-powered with sufficient resolution suitable for field studies. Transthoracic echocardiography is suitable for the sampling used in decompression studies to identify highly reflective gas bubbles. Detection of venous gas bubbles by ultrasound imaging is a sensitive, but not specific, predictor of adverse effects of decompression, similar to the published relationship between Doppler detected bubbles and decompression sickness.|$|E
25|$|Hollows and Rounds {{are similar}} to {{moulding}} planes, but lack a specific moulding profile. Instead, they cut either a simple concave or convex shape on the face or edge of a board to create a single element of a complex-profile moulding. They are used in pairs or sets of various sizes to create moulding profile elements such as fillets, coves, bullnoses, thumbnails ovolos, ogees, etc. When making mouldings, hollows and rounds must be used together to create the several shapes of the profile. However, they {{may be used as}} a <b>single</b> <b>plane</b> to create a simple decorative cove or round-over {{on the edge of a}} board.

25|$|The {{superior}} planet systems—Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—all {{follow the}} same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism. Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a <b>single</b> <b>plane</b> parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.|$|E

25|$|As flight speed {{increases}} supersonically {{the shock}} system is initially external. For the SR-71 this was until about M1.6 to M1.8 and M2 for the XB-70. The intake {{is said to}} be unstarted. Further increase in speed produces supersonic speeds inside the duct with a plane shock near the throat. The intake {{is said to be}} started. Upstream or downstream disturbances, such as gusts/atmospheric temperature gradients and engine airflow changes, both intentional and unintentional(from surging), tend to cause the shock to be expelled almost instantaneously. Expulsion of the shock, known as an unstart, causes all the supersonic compression to take place externally through a <b>single</b> <b>plane</b> shock. The intake has changed in a split second from its most efficient configuration with most of its supersonic compression taking place inside the duct to the least efficient as shown by the large loss in pressure recovery, from about 80% to about 20% at M3 flight speeds. There is a large drop in intake pressure and loss in thrust together with temporary loss of control of the aircraft.|$|E
