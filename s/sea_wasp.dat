40|$|The late Precambrian Kimberella quadrata Glaessner et Wade, 1966, {{a member}} of the Ediacara faunal assemblage, was {{originally}} described from the Pound Quartzite of the Ediacara Hills, South Australia. First recognized as a problematic fossil, possibly belonging to the Siphonophora (Glaessner, in Glaessner and Daily, 1959), Kimberella was first reconstructed as a medusa of uncertain affinities (Glaessner and Wade, 1966). Known from only a few specimens, it was later interpreted as a pelagic cnidarian medusa, closely related to extant cubozoans or box jellies (Wade, 1972). Later authors reconstructed Kimberella as a form similar to extant chirodropid cubozoans or <b>sea</b> <b>wasps</b> (Glaessner, 1984; Jenkins 1984, 1992; Gehling, 1991). Thus, Kimberella has been cited {{as one of the best}} examples of a metazoan lineage crossing the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary with essentially little morphological change up to the present. It has been used as one of the most convincing examples countering hypotheses that group all Vendian macrofossils into non-metazoan higher taxa (e. g. Seilacher, 1992). Acceptance of Kimberella as an essentially modern cubozoan also has fundamental paleoecological implications. Living chirodropids are fast-swimming predators with powerful venom, and Kimberella has so been reconstructed by som...|$|R

40|$|RRS Discovery Cruise 229 was {{the fourth}} {{in a series of}} cruises within a 3 -year {{contract}} (MAS 3 CT 950018), BENGAL, funded under the MAST III programme of the EU, running from February 1996 to January 1999. The overall objective of the contract is to monitor the influence of the seasonal sedimentation of phytodetritus on the benthic biology and chemistry of a study site on the Porcupine Abyssal Plain. Cruise 229 was timed to follow the expected deposition of phytodetritus on the seafloor in May/June. Although little phytodetritus was apparent, the cruise recovered a very comprehensive set of water column and seafloor samples. Successful operations included: multiple corer, box corer and Kasten core seabed sampling; CTD, rosette multi-sampler, marine snow profiler, stand-alone-pumping system and bottom water sampler studies of the water column; <b>WASP</b> <b>seabed</b> photography; semi-balloon otter trawl, chalut á perche (beam trawl) and epibenthic sledge megabenthos sampling; recovery and redeployment of long-term sediment trap, Bathysnap and Module Autonome de Colonisation moorings; and short-term operations of other landers and moorings, NIOZ benthic lander, BIOFEED enrichment experiment rig, DEMAR benthic amphipod trap and a moored stand-alone-pumping system. ...|$|R

The primary objectives of the present cruise were: a) to revisit a series of five previously established study sites (A 140, A 300, A 950, A 1200 and A 1850) spanning the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) as it impinges on the seabed at the Pakistan Margin; b) to assess the chemical oceanography of the water column overlying these sites, through CTD sensor profiles and chemical determinations on water bottle samples from both the CTD and BBLS; c) to initiate a programme of detailed seabed sampling at these sites to determine a suite of biological, chemical and biogeochemical parameters using a Megacorer and a multicorer; d) to assess and sample the megabenthos of these sites by the combined use of trawling (Agassiz trawl) and seabed photography (WASP); e) as possible, to carry out similar operations at a site located at a depth between A 300 and A 950; f) as possible, to provide additional general characterization of the seabed in the area of these sites using acoustic remote sensing (EM 12 and 3. 5 kHz) and <b>seabed</b> imagery (<b>WASP).</b> The cruise successfully achieved all of the planned objectives. The effort of assessing the science of the cruise will take many months of work ashore. Of those parameters that could be initially assessed onboard there was little indication of major change between cruises 145 and 150, other than in the OMZ itself. Minimum oxygen values encountered during cruise 145 were around 400 m, but during the present cruise were in the 150 - 200 m range. If a value of 0. 5 ml/l is used as a boundary, then it had shallowed from c. 180 m (CD 145) to c. 80 m (CD 150). There also appeared to be some elevation of the lower boundary of the OMZ, although this was less marked...|$|R

The primary objectives of the present cruise were: a) to establish a series of some five sites on a transect spanning the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone as it impinges on the seabed at the Pakistan Margin; b) to assess the chemical oceanography of the water column overlying these sites, through CTD sensor profiles and chemical determinations on water bottle samples from both the CTD and BBLS; c) to provide a general characterization of the seabed in the area of these sites using acoustic remote sensing (EM 12 and 3. 5 kHz) and seabed imagery (WASP); d) to initiate a programme of detailed seabed sampling at these sites to determine a suite of biological, chemical and biogeochemical parameters using a range of coring devices (multicorer, Megacorer, box corer); and e) to assess and sample the megabenthos of these sites by the combined use of trawling (Agassiz trawl) and <b>seabed</b> photography (<b>WASP).</b> Despite being beset by a number of difficulties, this was a very successful cruise that very largely achieved its planned objectives: 1) A series of five sites on a transect spanning the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone were established in the Pakistan Margin work area, with a sixth deep-water site also successfully studied; 2) CTD sensor profiles and chemical determinations on water bottle samples from both the CTD and BBLS were successfully undertaken at all six sites; 3) A substantial tranche of EM 12 swath bathymetric mapping, and supporting 3. 5 kHz seabed profiling, was achieved in the Pakistan Margin work area; 4) An extensive coring programme, delivering a wealth of samples, was successfully carried out at all six sites.; and 5) Good quality seabed imagery was obtained with the WASP system at all six primary sites and a further six additional sites. Supporting work with the trawl was also undertaken at five of the six study depths and additional depths in the lower boundary of the oxygen minimum zone where rapid changes in the composition of the megabenthic fauna appears to occur. In summary, this cruise laid a firm foundation on which forthcoming cruises (see CD 146, 150 and 151) will build...|$|R

The most deadly cnidocytes (to humans, at least) are found on the body of a box jellyfish. One member of this family, the <b>sea</b> <b>wasp,</b> Chironex fleckeri, is [...] "claimed to be the most venomous marine animal known," [...] according to the Australian Institute of Marine Science. It can cause excruciating pain to humans, sometimes followed by death. Other cnidarians, such as the jellyfish Cyanea capillata (the [...] "Lion's Mane" [...] made famous by Sherlock Holmes) or the siphonophore Physalia physalis (Portuguese man o' war, [...] "Bluebottle") can cause extremely painful and sometimes fatal stings. On the other hand, aggregating sea anemones may have the lowest sting intensity, perhaps due to the inability of the nematocysts to penetrate the skin, creating a feeling similar to touching sticky candies. Besides feeding and defense, sea anemone and coral colonies use cnidocytes to sting one another in order to defend or win space.|$|E
