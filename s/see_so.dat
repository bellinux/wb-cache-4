5|$|A {{dense fog}} helped to cloud {{the advance of}} St. Hilaire's French division, but as they went up the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and {{encouraged}} them forward. Russian soldiers and commanders {{on top of the}} heights were stunned to <b>see</b> <b>so</b> many French troops coming towards them. Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, General Vandamme's division attacked an area called Staré Vinohrady ("Old Vineyards") and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{variant of}} {{iterative}} {{learning in the}} limit (cf. [LZ 96]) is studied when a learner gets negative examples refuting conjectures containing data {{in excess of the}} target language and uses additional information of the following four types: a) memorizing up to n input elements <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> far; b) up to n feedback memberships queries (testing if an item {{is a member of the}} input <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> far); c) the number of input elements <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> far; d) the maximal element of the input <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> far. We explore how additional information available to such learners (defined and studied in [JK 07]) may help. In particular, we show that adding the maximal element or the number of elements <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> far helps such learners to infer any indexed class of languages class-preservingly (using a descriptive numbering defining the class) — as it is proved in [JK 07], this is not possible without using additional information. We also study how, in the given context, different types of additional information fare against each other, and establish hierarchies of learners memorizing n + 1 versus n input elements seen and n + 1 versus n feedback membership queries. ...|$|R

25|$|Established in 498 as Diocese of Tindari (Italian) / Tyndaris (Latin) / Tyndaritan(us) (Latin adjective). In {{the early}} 7th century Sicily had no Metropolitan <b>see,</b> <b>so</b> {{although}} politically {{part of the}} Byzantine empire, all its bishoprics were in the sway of the papal ('Western') Patriarchate of Rome as (exempt) suffragan dioceses of Rome. During the conflict on Iconoclasm, Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian transferred all Sicily to his capital's Patriarchate of Constantinople (circa 732); in the 8th or 9th century, the newly created Metropolitan Archdiocese of Syracuse was given all Sicilian bishoprics as suffragans, including Tindari, where no bishops were recorded since 649.|$|E
25|$|At that time, {{the city}} of Turin had a {{population}} of 117,000 inhabitants. It reflected the effects of industrialization and urbanization: numerous poor families lived in the slums of the city, having come from the countryside {{in search of a}} better life. In visiting the prisons, Don Bosco was disturbed to <b>see</b> <b>so</b> many boys from 12 to 18 years of age. He was determined to find a means to prevent them ending up here. Because of population growth and migration to the city, Bosco found the traditional methods of parish ministry inefficient. He decided it was necessary to try another form of apostolate, and he began to meet the boys where they worked and gathered in shops and market places. They were pavers, stone-cutters, masons, plasterers who came from far away places, he recalled in his brief Memoires.|$|E

500|$|Filming took {{around six}} weeks, {{relatively}} short for a thriller; Weisz said most take {{about three months}} to complete. Producers used hand-held cameras and had a lower budget than usual for the genre. Kondracki said filming in Eastern Europe was crucial, [...] "In a story such as this, it's more about what you don't <b>see,</b> <b>so</b> you need to create that world." [...] The Carpathian Mountains in Romania served as the backdrop for the war-ravaged Sarajevo of the late 1990s. Scenes set in UN buildings were filmed in Toronto. Most outdoor scenes are set at night; daytime shots often appear bleak, gray and overcast. This, coupled with a grainy texture, helped create a documentary feel.|$|E

500|$|The poem {{starts with}} a {{flattering}} question to the beloved—"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" [...] The beloved is [...] "more lovely and more temperate" [...] than a summer's day. The speaker lists some negative things about summer: it is short—"summer's lease hath all too short a date"—and sometimes the sun is too hot—"Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines." [...] However, the beloved has beauty that will last forever, unlike the fleeting beauty of a summer's day. By putting his love's beauty into the form of poetry, the poet is preserving it forever. [...] "So long as men can breathe, or eyes can <b>see,</b> <b>So</b> long lives this, and this gives life to thee." [...] The lover's beauty will live on, through the poem which will {{last as long as}} it can be read.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V.

500|$|Ernest was {{fortunate}} in {{his support of}} victorious Prussia; many other petty German dukes, princes, and kings who had supported Austria suffered immensely at Hohenzollern hands. Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, and Nassau for instance were all annexed to Prussia {{at the expense of}} their respective rulers. Though he had only recently changed his political views, Ernest was allowed to ride at the head of his battalion during the victory parade. His eldest niece Prussian Crown Princess Victoria ("Vicky") was for one pleased with his Prussian support and commented [...] "I am not accustomed to hearing so much praise of Coburg here. [...] was not among the crushed and beaten foe, it is sad enough as it is to <b>see</b> <b>so</b> many of one's friends suffering from the effects of their miscalculations".

500|$|The {{strategy}} paid off, {{and in the}} wind-whipped Cleveland Municipal Stadium {{two days}} after Christmas, the Browns beat the Colts 27–0. Neither team scored in the first half, prompting New York Times columnist Red Smith to quip, [...] "Never have so many paid so dearly – $10, $8, and $6 – and suffered so sorely to <b>see</b> <b>so</b> little." [...] In the second half, the Browns' defense held on and the offense kicked into gear. Baltimore's cornerbacks were double-teaming Warfield, which Ryan exploited by throwing three touchdowns to his second wideout, Gary Collins. The Browns scored 10 points {{in the third quarter}} and a further 17 in the fourth, clinching the first title since Otto Graham's departure after the 1955 season. Collins was named the game's MVP. [...] This would be the last time that any professional sports team from Cleveland would win a league title until 2016, when the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers won the 2016 NBA Finals.|$|E
500|$|In 1576, in a {{move that}} {{endangered}} Henry's throne, Francis allied with the Protestant princes against the crown. On 6 May 1576, Catherine gave in to almost all Huguenot demands in the Edict of Beaulieu. The treaty became known as the Peace of Monsieur because it was thought that Francis had forced it on the crown. Francis died of consumption in June 1584, after a disastrous intervention in the Low Countries during which his army had been massacred. Catherine wrote, the next day: [...] "I am so wretched to live long enough to <b>see</b> <b>so</b> many people die before me, although I realize that God's will must be obeyed, that He owns everything, and that he lends us only for as long as He likes the children whom He gives us." [...] The death of her youngest son was a calamity for Catherine's dynastic dreams. Under Salic law, by which only males could ascend the throne, the Huguenot Henry of Navarre now became heir presumptive to the French crown.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{was a man}} of high {{ideals and}} was popular with his fellow players. Pelham Warner commented on his {{pleasant}} nature and Robert Trumble, an author and son of Hugh Trumble, recalled him as honest, direct and without guile. [...] An anecdote told about Hill had him hitting a low shot into shadows where Warren Bardsley was fielding. He completed one run and then asked the umpire if the ball had been caught. [...] The shadow made it impossible for the umpire to <b>see,</b> <b>so</b> Hill then asked Bardsley, [...] "Did you catch it?" [...] When Bardsley replied in the affirmative, Hill immediately walked to the pavilion. When England won four Tests in a row in 1911–12, Hill managed to retain the confidence of his players. [...] Frank Iredale wrote that Hill was a cheery skipper whose men were happy under his leadership. Despite breaking many records, Hill showed little awareness of them. [...] When watching Jack Hobbs break his record for the most runs in Test cricket at Headingley in 1926, it was Hobbs' wife sitting nearby who had to remind Hill that the record was previously his.|$|E
