25|$|Residences in Cottage Home are {{typified by}} spindlework porches, turned posts, gable ornaments, {{variegated}} and fishscale <b>shingling</b> and gingerbread trim, features {{often found in}} Queen Anne and Folk Victorian homes. These types of detailing were placed on simple folk homes as an inexpensive way to provide varied design and personalization. This practice was common in Victorian-era working-class neighborhoods such as Cottage Home.|$|E

These <b>shingles</b> {{are designed to}} avoid repetitive patterns in the <b>shingle</b> appearance. Special <b>shingles</b> are needed for the eaves starter course and ridge caps. Laminated <b>shingles</b> are heavier and more durable than traditional 3-tab <b>shingle</b> designs.|$|R
25|$|The house Sweet {{purchased}} is a 1½-story brick house, {{built in}} 1919, and {{is typical of}} many homes in working-class Detroit neighborhoods. It is a Bungalow-style structure with a full basement, an open porch on the first floor, and an enclosed sun porch on the south side. The second story is covered with brown <b>shingling,</b> and atop {{the house is a}} simple gable roof with a central dormer. The house is enclosed by an unpainted silver aluminum fence.|$|E
25|$|The House at 902 Selden Road is low, -story, gable-roofed, early 20th-century house.

500|$|Before he left, Carlton plotted to {{kill the}} {{residents}} of Taliesin. His primary target was draftsman Emil Brodelle, who had called Carlton a [...] "black son-of-a-bitch" [...] on August 12 for not following an order. Brodelle and Carlton also engaged in a minor physical confrontation two days later. He planned the assault, targeting the noon hour, when Borthwick, her children, and the studio personnel would be {{on opposite sides of}} the property awaiting lunch. Wright was away in Chicago completing Midway Gardens while Borthwick stayed at home with her two children, 11-year old John and 9-year-old Martha. On August 15, Carlton grabbed a <b>shingling</b> hatchet and began an attack. He started with the Borthwicks, who were waiting on the porch off the living room. Mamah Borthwick was killed by a single blow to the face, and her son John was slaughtered as he sat in his chair. Martha managed to flee, but was hunted down and slain in the courtyard. He then coated the bodies in gasoline and lit them on fire, setting the house ablaze.|$|E
50|$|Fiberglass <b>shingles</b> {{are slowly}} {{replacing}} organic felt <b>shingles</b> and by 1982 {{the production of}} fiberglass <b>shingles</b> overtook organic <b>shingles.</b> Widespread hurricane damage in Florida during the 1990s prompted the industry to adhere to a 1700-gram tear value on finished asphalt <b>shingles.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Shingle</b> {{fabrication}} was revolutionized in {{the early}} 19th century by steam-powered saw mills. <b>Shingle</b> mills made possible the production of uniform <b>shingles</b> in mass quantities. The sawn <b>shingle</b> of uniform taper and smooth surface eliminated the need to hand dress. The supply of wooden <b>shingles</b> was therefore no longer limited by local factors. These changes coincided with (and in turn increased) the popularity of architectural styles such as Carpenter Gothic, Queen Anne, and <b>Shingle</b> style architecture that used <b>shingles</b> to great effect.|$|R

50|$|<b>Shingle</b> Mill- Before the <b>Shingle</b> Mill, early {{settlers}} had to {{make their}} own <b>shingles</b> by splitting cedar with a froe (a tool with a long iron blade that was struck with a heavy mallet) and then shaved to the proper thickness with a drawknife. With the <b>Shingle</b> Mill, hundreds of <b>shingles</b> could be produced in an hour. The cedar <b>shingles</b> on some of the building in the Village were made by this mill.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} the wind-induced tearing and blow-off of asphalt roofing <b>shingles,</b> {{which are the}} most frequently observed forms of residential building damage in hurricanes. Field surveys indicate that in-service asphalt <b>shingle</b> sealant strips can lose adhesion along their leading edge over time, leaving the <b>shingle</b> partially unsealed and susceptible to wind uplift. Two interrelated studies {{presented in this paper}} show that unsealing is a naturally occurring process and that unsealed <b>shingles</b> are a contributing cause of <b>shingle</b> roof cover damage in high winds. The first study quantified the number, location, and failure mode of laminate and three-tab style <b>shingle</b> systems installed on residential buildings at 30 sites in Florida and Texas. Systematic patterns of partially unsealed field <b>shingles</b> found on 22 of the 30 roofs resembled spatial patterns of wind-induced <b>shingle</b> damage observed in post-hurricane building performance assessments. As expected, older roofs generally contained more unsealed <b>shingles</b> than newer roofs. The results of the second study link blow-off to partially unsealed <b>shingles.</b> Seventeen ASTM D 7158 Class H asphalt <b>shingle</b> roofs were aged outside for nominally one year at the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety Research Center and then evaluated in full-scale wind tunnel tests. Partially unsealed field and hip <b>shingles</b> frequently exhibited damage during wind testing, while fully sealed <b>shingles</b> were not damaged unless adjacent, unsealed <b>shingles</b> failed first...|$|R

50|$|Solar <b>shingles,</b> {{also called}} {{photovoltaic}} <b>shingles,</b> are solar panels {{designed to look}} like and function as conventional roofing materials, such as asphalt <b>shingle</b> or slate, while also producing electricity.

50|$|Roof <b>shingles</b> {{are almost}} always highly visible and so are an {{important}} aspect of a building's aesthetics in patterns, textures and colors. Roof <b>shingles,</b> like other building materials on vernacular buildings, are typically of a material locally available. The type of <b>shingle</b> is taken into account before construction because the material affects the roof pitch and construction method: Some <b>shingles</b> can be installed on lath where others need solid sheathing (sheeting) on the roof deck. All <b>shingle</b> roofs are installed from the bottom upward beginning with a starter course and the edge seams offset to avoid leaks. Many <b>shingle</b> installations benefit from being placed on top of an underlayment material such as asphalt felt paper to prevent leaks even from wind driven rain and snow and ice dams in cold climates. At the ridge the <b>shingles</b> {{on one side of the}} roof simply extend past the ridge or there is a ridge cap consisting of boards, copper, or lead sheeting. An asphalt <b>shingle</b> roof has flexible asphalt <b>shingles</b> as the ridge cap. Some roof <b>shingles</b> are non-combustable or have a better fire rating than others which influence their use, some building codes do not allow the use of <b>shingles</b> with less than a class-A fire rating to be used on some types of buildings. Due to increased fire hazard, wood <b>shingles</b> and organic-based asphalt <b>shingles</b> have become less common than fiberglass-based asphalt <b>shingles.</b> No <b>shingles</b> are water-tight so the minimum recommended roof pitch is 4:12 without additional underlayment materials.|$|R
