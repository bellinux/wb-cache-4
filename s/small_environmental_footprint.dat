50|$|Enzymes are {{proteins}} that catalyze (i.e. accelerate) chemical reactions. They are natural catalysts and are ubiquitous, in plants, animals and microorganisms where they catalyze {{processes that are}} vital to living organisms. They are intimately involved in numerous biotechnological processes, such as cheese making, beer brewing and winemaking, that {{date back to the}} dawn of civilization. Recent advances in biotechnology, particularly in genetic and protein engineering, and genetics have provided the basis for the efficient development of enzymes with improved properties for established applications and novel, tailor-made enzymes for completely new applications where enzymes were not previously used. Today, enzymes are widely applied in many different industries and the number of applications continues to increase. Examples include food (baking, dairy products, starch conversion) and beverage (beer, wine, fruit and vegetable juices) processing, animal feed, textiles, pulp and paper, detergents, biosensors, cosmetics, health care and nutrition, waste water treatment, pharmaceutical and chemical manufacture and, more recently, biofuels such as biodiesel.

Biomass based organic aerogels and carbon aerogels, featuring low cost, high scalability, and <b>small</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint,</b> represent an important new research direction in (carbon) aerogel development. Cellulose and lignin {{are the two most}} abundant natural polymers in the world, and the aerogels based on them are very promising. Classic silicon aerogels and available organic resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) or lignin-resorcinol-formaldehyde (LRF) aerogels are brittle and fragile; toughening of the aerogels is highly desired to expand their applications. This study reports the first attempt to toughen the intrinsically brittle LRF aerogel and carbon aerogel using bacterial cellulose. The facile process is catalyst-free and cost-effective. The toughened carbon aerogels, consisting of blackberry-like, core-shell structured, and highly graphitized carbon nanofibers, are able to undergo at least 20 % reversible compressive deformation. Due to their unique nanostructure and large mesopore population, the carbon materials exhibit an areal capacitance higher than most of the reported values in the literature. This property makes them suitable candidates for flexible solid-state energy storage devices. Besides energy storage, the conductive interconnected nanoporous structure can also find applications in oil/water separation, catalyst supports, sensors, and so forth. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The negative consequences of mining include toxic effluents from mineral processing and decanting streams, even after mine closure. Large volumes of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) are expected to increase as the {{mining industry}} grows. Currently, biological treatment of mine waters are preferred to chemical methods, due to various advantages offered such as low operational cost and <b>small</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint.</b> Biological treatment of AMD primarily rely on the activity of sulphate reducing bacteria which reduce sulphate to sulphide in the presence of organic matter thus allowing the precipitation of the metals and increase in pH. However, excess of sulphide remains in the system and if not removed, can be oxidized to sulphate. A sustainable AMD management plan could entail development of treatment technologies to remove total sulphur (sum of sulphur species) from the system. Production of elemental sulphur, which involves partial oxidation of sulphide, has been a recent subject of interest. The use of colourless sulphide oxidizing bacteria, especially Thiobacillus species has been widely reported. Six isolates of sulphide oxidizing microorganisms, of which 4 bacterial and 2 filamentous fungal species from a gold mine (Johannesburg, South Africa) were tested in this study to achieve partial oxidation of sulphide to sulphur. The microbial species were selected for high sulphide oxidation in the presence of carbon sources (glucose and lactate). Lysinicibacillus fusiformis was observed to be the most suitable microorganism for sulphide oxidation. In iiorder to investigate optimal conditions for sulphur recovery, L. fusiformis bacterial activity was tested under different conditions of pH and redox potential. It resulted that at a pH of 8 and Eh of - 80 mV up to 95 % of sulphur was recovered. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015. tm 2015 Chemical EngineeringMEngUnrestricte...|$|E

Due to the low number of SEVs in real accidents it is difficult to judge the collision severity of these vehicles, especially if such vehicles are equipped with ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) in order to avoid accidents or mitigate injury severity. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the collision severity of SEVs in real accidents to assess the injury severity of the occupants. Further the effectiveness of a collision mitigation system (CMS) that aims to reduce impact speeds or, if possible, avoid collisions of passenger cars is evaluated. The method used in this study refers to the virtual pre-crash simulation. In a first simulation (called the baseline simulation) the original vehicles were successively replaced by an L 7 e so that collisions between original cars and L 7 e cars are considered. In a second simulation (system simulation) it was assumed that the L 7 e vehicles are virtually equipped with a CMS. Certain characteristics of the CMS such as sensor range or opening angle and various response strategies were varied. The response strategies under investigation are:a) warning to the driver at 2. 6 s TTC (time to collision) and fully braking after 0. 8 s reaction time,b) braking with 50 % brake force at 1. 6 s TTC and fully braking at 0. 8 s TTC,c) braking with 50 % brake force at 1. 6 s TTC and finallyd) fully braking at 0. 8 s TTC. Occupants of L 7 e vehicles generally have a higher risk to suffer MAIS 3 + injury than in M 1 vehicles.

Gekko has found that many ores respond favourably to fine crushing with either high pressure grinding rolls or vertical shaft impactors which when combined with the inline pressure jig gravity separator and coarse flotation results in a narrow, low-head, compact processing plant that can be sensibly fitted in existing underground openings. The focus on fine crushing reduces the power requirements of the plant to approximately 5 kWh/t for a capacity of up to 20 t/h run of mine ore feed.

The theme of the workshop was to explore the feasibility and economic potential of increasing the power output of geothermal wells by an order of magnitude by drilling deeper to reach much higher pressures and temperatures. Development of higher enthalpy geothermal systems for power production has obvious advantages; specifically higher temperatures yield higher power outputs per well so that fewer wells are needed, leading to <b>smaller</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> for a given size of power plant.

However drilling deeper involves technical and economic challenges. One approach to mitigating the cost issue is to form a consortium of industry, government and academia to share the costs and broaden the scope of investigation.

The monogenean blood-sucking Sparicotyle chrisophrii and the emaciating intestinal myxozoan Enteromyxum leei, are the most widely reported pathogenic parasites in these conditions, and tools for their prevention and control in production conditions are rather limited. Lack of effective and licensed treatments and pressure for a <b>smaller</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint</b> of the activity has stimulated the development of bioactive additives and supplemented feeds as a possible strategy to Mitigate health problems in cage-cultured fish. Some of these products have clearly demonstrated biocidal and/or immunomodulating activity at laboratory scale with certain host-pathogen models. However, {{there is a significant}} lack of corroborating data from commercial scale cage production conditions, wherein fish must cope with multiple, sustained biotic and abiotic stressors. Since different parasites exploit different host niches using a wide repertoir of pathogenic mechanisms, it is important to evaluate the possible benefits of such strategies under real world conditions. In this study, groups of GSB fed a control and an experimental diet with commercial prebiotics and active ingredients (contained in Previda® and NextEnhance® supplements) were reared in triplicate experimental cages in Western Greece. Biometrical, haematological and parasitological data (focused on prevalence and abundance of gill monogeneans Sparicotyle chrisophrii and Furnestinia echeneis) was collected monthly (9 samplings along 14 months), with additional intermediate and final samplings analysing intestinal and kidney endoparasites. In addition, subsets from both groups were transferred to full-size production cages, and reared to commercial size (roughly 16 months). At harvest, these fish were also sampled for parasites, including a quantification of Enteromyxum leei load on the intestines using qPCR. Analyses of biometrical, haematological and parasitological data from both groups are presented and the differences between both fish groups are discussed. While certain differential effects can be observed with the feeds tested, the study highlights the difficulties to translate sensible nutritional prophylaxis strategies into immediate solutions for complex, multifactorial processes such as different host-parasite relationships.
