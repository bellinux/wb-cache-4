50|$|Tullio Campagnolo {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} legends in bicycle component invention and manufacture. During his life Tullio Campagnolo applied for many patents, and many design registrations (some of these were not in the field of bicycles, or bicycle parts). His designs were extremely influential, and very widely copied. Several companies produced items that were nearly identical in design, but consumers preferred the original as a status symbol, and as a guarantee of quality. In 1930, he patented the cam mechanism quick-release skewer that became the standard for the industry, a design still used today. In 1933, the first quick release hubs were produced by Campagnolo. Also in 1933, he patented the <b>sliding</b> <b>hub,</b> dual seatstay rod-operated, back-pedal derailleur, ultimately known as the 'Cambio Corsa'. In 1949, he introduced the 'Gran Sport' twin-cable, parallelogram rear derailleur at the Milan trade show, the first modern derailleur.|$|E
50|$|The {{different}} {{products and}} services of segment D include {{a wide range of}} application in engineering and plant manufacturing. The assortment contains sprocket chains, wheels and wheel discs, spur wheels, spur racks, bevel gears, chain tighteners, clutches, <b>sliding</b> <b>hubs,</b> tooth belts and discs, clamping sets and other components.|$|R
50|$|The {{slipper clutch}} {{consists}} of two bases, one with dog clutches and ramps with ball bearings, a splined hub, and clutch plates. In normal operation, the dog clutches mate, driving the transmission. When a back torque comes from the transmission, the splined <b>hub</b> <b>slides</b> up the bearing ramps, disconnecting from the clutch plates and allowing a limited slip between input and output.|$|R
5000|$|The {{system used}} two chain-lifters {{to lift the}} chain from the sprockets.The cyclist would then back-pedal to {{disengage}} the chain and then shift thesprocket cluster laterally to the desired position. It would then engagewhen the cyclist started pedalling again. [...] To allow for the smaller sprockets to <b>slide</b> into the <b>hub,</b> the larger gears were away from the wheel (unlike modern sprockets).|$|R
50|$|Brakes {{were the}} same across the range using a hub {{integrated}} (i.e. not a hat rotor) front ventilated disc design of 287 mm and single piston callipers <b>sliding</b> on the <b>hub</b> carrier. The rear used solid discs also at 287 mm and the rear callipers carried over the Ford handbrake system using a threaded piston applying the handbrake cable forces to the rear disc pads.|$|R
2500|$|In late-April 2016, BlackBerry {{began to}} release an upgrade to Android 6.0 [...] "Marshmallow"; along with {{features}} {{added to the}} core Android platform (which includes a new permissions system, and systems to reduce background activity when the device is not being physically handled to conserve battery power), it adds S/MIME, Slack, Skype, and Pinterest support to BlackBerry <b>Hub,</b> <b>slide</b> input on the physical keyboard, faster autofocus, and 24fps and 120fps video recording modes.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a modular {{propeller}} is to provide more user control on boat rally speed. Each modular propeller made of composite materials has three main parts: the hub part with a front-end cap, a set of replaceable blades, and a rear joint to the shaft. The propeller blade parts assembly into <b>slides</b> of the <b>hub</b> requires not professional assistance, but desscrewing a high quality bronze to remove cone. The blade` bottom joint part of composite blades must be compatible by manufacturer design to overall license the blade assembly for use.|$|R
