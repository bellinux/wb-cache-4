5|$|Alternative Songs is {{a record}} chart that ranks the most-played songs on American modern rock radio <b>stations.</b> Published by the music {{industry}} magazine Billboard, it {{was created in the}} midst of the growing popularity of alternative music on rock radio in the late 1980s. As less-established alternative acts were receiving minimal exposure on album-oriented rock (AOR) radio <b>stations,</b> their labels turned to modern rock <b>stations</b> for airplay. Billboard introduced the chart in response to demand within the music industry for consistent information on the commercial performance of alternative music. During the decade, it was known as the Modern Rock Tracks chart and tabulated based on weighted reports from twenty-nine radio stations: eighteen established standard-bearer commercial <b>stations</b> and eleven non-commercial college <b>stations.</b>|$|E

Most <b>stations</b> had two stories and an attic, although some of the <b>stations</b> serving lesser places had smaller buildings.

5|$|DuMont {{aspired to}} grow beyond its three <b>stations,</b> {{applying}} for new television station licenses in Cincinnati and Cleveland in 1947. This {{would give the}} network five owned-and-operated <b>stations</b> (O), the maximum allowed by the FCC at the time. However, DuMont was hampered by Paramount's two <b>stations,</b> KTLA (channel 5) in Los Angeles and WBKB (channel 4, now WBBM-TV on channel 2) in Chicago – {{the descendants of the}} two experimental <b>stations</b> that rankled DuMont in 1940. Although these <b>stations</b> did not carry DuMont programming (with the exception of KTLA for one year from 1947 to 1948), and in fact competed against DuMont's affiliates in those cities, the FCC ruled that Paramount essentially controlled DuMont, which effectively placed the network at the five-station cap. Paramount's exertion of influence over the network's management and the power of its voting stock brought the FCC to its conclusion. Thus, DuMont was unable to open additional <b>stations</b> as long as Paramount owned <b>stations</b> or owned a portion of DuMont. Paramount refused to sell.|$|E
