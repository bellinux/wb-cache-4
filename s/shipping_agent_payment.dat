40|$|The article {{presents}} structural changes in liner shipping sector, as many global Container shipping lines are opening their own agencies and many independent <b>shipping</b> <b>agents</b> are consecutively closing down their activities, either via takeovers or by {{going out of}} business completely. The process of horizontal and vertical integration in shipping industry is re-shaping the entire logistics industry. Such changes put pressure on <b>shipping</b> <b>agents</b> to redefine their market role and develop services with added quality, and relationships with actual and new principals. They are forced to seek for new ways to make income therefore they are forced to perform additional roles, in order to satisfy carriers on one hand, and usually just a few clients, on the other. A market analysis in Slovenia has been performed among companies offering ship-port services, with focus on comparison between independent agents and Container Line offices. It has been ascertained that independent <b>shipping</b> <b>agents</b> must implement the new strategy which is closer to a forwarder’s mentality and market role...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} bidding {{selection}} and assignment {{problem with a}} novel constraint, namely minimum quantity commitment (MQC), motivated by the Royal Philips Electronics Company. Responding to the stipulations by the US Federal Maritime Commission, any <b>shipping</b> <b>agent</b> transporting to the US must satisfy a minimum quantity of containers. To insure this MQC for <b>shipping</b> <b>agents,</b> the Royal Philips Electronics Company, {{with a large number}} of shipping needs, has to assign enough containers to each selected <b>shipping</b> <b>agent</b> to transport cargos to the US. This restriction creates difficulties for Philips as the company seeks to satisfy its shipping needs with minimum total costs. To solve this problem, we first formulate it by a mixed-integer programming model. In order for both linear programming relaxation and Lagrangian relaxation to provide good lower bounds, we then strengthen the model by a few valid inequalities. Furthermore, a Lagrangian-based heuristic and a branch and cut solver are applied to solve the problem. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of all the models and methods...|$|R
