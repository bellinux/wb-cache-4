5|$|According to officials, the <b>sinkhole</b> had {{similarities}} {{with another}} Guatemalan <b>sinkhole</b> which collapsed in 2007, which {{may also have}} been formed by ruptured sewage pipes.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the risk}} of sinkholes {{occurring}} in Guatemala City is high and unpredictable. One recent, similar <b>sinkhole</b> had collapsed in 2007, forming a pit 100 metres deep. The 2007 Guatemala City <b>sinkhole</b> was formed by fluid from a sewer eroding uncemented volcanic ash, limestone, and other pyroclastic deposits underlying Guatemala City. The hazards around the pipe have since then been mitigated, by improved handling of the city's wastewater and runoff. Several rainstorms {{also contributed to the}} sinkhole's collapse, as stormwater percolated into the ground, further dissolving the rocks beneath Guatemala City. The 2010 <b>sinkhole</b> was formed for similar reasons.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sinkhole</b> formed due to {{volcanic}} pumice deposits, {{upon which}} Guatemala City is built. These deposits were unconsolidated and of low density, allowing easy erosion. According to Sam Bonis, a geologist at Dartmouth College, leaking pipes went unfixed {{long enough to}} create the conditions necessary for <b>sinkhole</b> formation because of lax city zoning regulations and building codes. Bonis also says that the Guatemala City <b>sinkhole</b> is a misnomer: sinkholes have natural causes, but this one was mainly artificial. In addition, according to Bonis, sinkholes are usually formed from limestone {{but there is no}} limestone hundreds of metres underneath Guatemala City. Bonis proposes that the <b>sinkhole</b> be renamed a piping feature.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sinkholes</b> tend {{to occur}} in karst landscapes. Karst landscapes can have up to {{thousands}} of <b>sinkholes</b> within a small area, giving the landscape a pock-marked appearance. These <b>sinkholes</b> drain all the water, so there are only subterranean rivers in these areas. Examples of karst landscapes with a plethora of massive <b>sinkholes</b> include Khammouan Mountains (Laos) and Mamo Plateau (Papua New Guinea). The largest known <b>sinkholes</b> formed in sandstone are Sima Humboldt and Sima Martel in Venezuela.|$|R

40|$|Comparison of a {{database}} of interpreted <b>sinkholes</b> made using airborne laser swath mapping (ALSM) with databases of <b>sinkholes</b> made from interpretation of aerial photographs reveals substantial disagreement. The discrepancies involve the location, number, areas, and circularity of interpreted <b>sinkholes.</b> Methodological {{factors that contribute to}} the discrepancies include blockage of ALSM laser returns in thick vegetation, multi-path reflections, and misrepresentation of the true extent of <b>sinkholes.</b> Comparison of two ALSM-derived databases made (1) independently from versus (2) in combination with earlier air photo analysis in undeveloped regions had the following result: one-fourth of the <b>sinkholes</b> interpreted by using the composite method were missed by the independent analysis, and one-third of the <b>sinkholes</b> that were interpreted from the independent analysis were not interpreted as <b>sinkholes</b> using the composite method. Subjective interpretation leads to a high level of uncertainty such that the results of the remote sensing studies are suspect, if not invalid...|$|R

5|$|Barry dropped {{moderate}} to heavy rainfall across Florida, peaking at 6.99inches (178mm) at Palm Beach International Airport; several other locations reported over 3inches (75mm). The rainfall alleviated persistent drought conditions and assisted in combating severe wildfires across the state. In Brevard County, the rainfall closed {{a portion of}} Eau Gallie Boulevard after a large <b>sinkhole</b> developed. Several other roads across the area were flooded, and on Interstate 95 near Lake Worth, a <b>sinkhole</b> closed two lanes of traffic. Wet roads caused several traffic accidents across the state; in both Brevard and Volusia counties, a motorist was killed from an accident. On Interstate 4, a tractor trailer led to disruptions near Orlando after it crashed into a guardrail.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} sinkhole's collapse, there were plans {{to fill it}} in with a soil cement made from cement, limestone, and water known locally as lodocreto ("mudcrete"). This {{substance}} was also used {{to fill in the}} 2007 Guatemala City <b>sinkhole.</b> However, another technique, which geologists call the graded-filter technique, in which the <b>sinkhole</b> is filled with successive layers of boulders, smaller rocks, and gravel, could possibly be a better solution. This is because filling the hole in with cement diverts water runoff to other areas, potentially increasing the risk of sinkholes occurring {{in other parts of the}} city. The graded-filter technique, on the other hand, allows water to seep through.|$|E
40|$|Florida has a {{major problem}} {{when it comes to}} <b>sinkholes.</b> These <b>sinkholes</b> can become very {{hazardous}} to people, homes, and to the landscape as a whole. Florida sits on a carbonate platform which is highly indicative of <b>sinkholes.</b> There are three main types of <b>sinkholes</b> which occur in Florida: dissolution, cover subsidence, and cover collapse. I will compare these types of <b>sinkholes</b> to the underlying formation beneath Florida {{to see if there is}} a connection between the types of <b>sinkholes</b> that occur. I will also create a 3 D model of grout injection stabilization and calculate its volume to compare to the actual volume placed under the house. This information will help inform and bring attention to the problem in Florida and in turn, may help alleviate the problem if we can understand what causes these <b>sinkholes.</b> The 3 D model may help engineering companies become more efficient in predicting the projected amount of volume to stabilize a house that may be in danger. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1989, an {{overpass}} {{being built}} at MD198 over the B–W Parkway {{just east of}} Laurel collapsed during rush hour, injuring fourteen motorists and construction workers. The incident was blamed on faulty scaffolding used to support the uncompleted span. On July 9, 2005, a <b>sinkhole</b> opened beneath the parkway at a construction site, leading to the complete closure of the northbound roadway. The <b>sinkhole</b> was filled with concrete {{to shore up the}} roadbed and prevent further collapse; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers attempted to expedite repairs, but the route remained closed until the next day. On August 24, 2007, both directions of the parkway were closed when chunks of concrete fell from the overpass at MD193 (Greenbelt Road) onto the northbound lanes.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{percolation}} {{of water}} in the ground is responsible for measurable electric potentials called self-potentials. These potentials are influenced by the distribution of the electrical conductivity of the ground. Because <b>sinkholes</b> are associated both with self-potential and electrical conductivity anomalies, a joint inversion of EM- 34 conductivity and self-potential data is proposed as a way of delineating the location of these features. Self-potential and EM conductivity data were obtained at a test site in Normandy (France) where <b>sinkholes</b> and crypto-sinkholes are present over a karstic area in a chalk substratum overlain by clay-with-flint and loess covers. The presence of <b>sinkholes</b> and crypto-sinkholes is associated with negative self-potential anomalies with respect to a reference electrode located outside the area where the <b>sinkholes</b> are clustered. The <b>sinkholes</b> also have a conductivity signature identified by the EM- 34 conductivity data. We used the simulated-annealing method, which is a global optimization technique, to invert jointly EM- 34 conductivity and self-potential data. Self-potential and electrical conductivity provide clear complementary information to determine the interface between the loess and clay-with-flint formations. The <b>sinkholes</b> and crypto-sinkholes are marked by depressions in this interface, focusing the groundwater flow towards the aquifer contained in the chalk substratum...|$|R
