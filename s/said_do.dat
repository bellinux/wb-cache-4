25|$|Hansen {{said one}} of his most {{important}} achievements in the Senate was the passage of amendments to the Surface Mining Act which prevent mining companies from confiscating the wealth from private lands by means of following an oil bed onto adjacent properties. Farmers and ranchers as a whole in Wyoming, he <b>said,</b> <b>do</b> not object to mining but want compensation if minerals are found on their lands. Hansen said that the amendments have proved important over time because of the large coal industry now rooted in his state.|$|E
500|$|Ben Stein's famous {{monotonous}} lecture {{about the}} Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was not originally in Hughes's script. Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement {{of the student}} cast. [...] "I {{was just going to}} do it off camera, but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) <b>said</b> <b>do</b> it on camera, improvise, something you know a lot about. When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because they thought I was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E

500|$|The four verses each {{consist of}} two {{questions}} asked by [...] "Files" [...] and answered by the Sergeant- a call-and-response form – {{and then another}} four lines of the Sergeant explaining, as above. In some interpretations, the second four lines are taken to be spoken by a third voice, another [...] "file-on-parade". Both the poem's rhythm and its rhyme scheme reinforce the idea of drilling infantry by giving the effect of feet marching generally but not perfectly in unison: [...] Although the poem's overall meter is iambic, each line in the verses and, to the slightly lesser extent, the chorus features syllables with additional grammatical and phonetic emphasis that fit {{the rhythm of the}} [...] "left, left, left right left" [...] marching cadence. [...] The first four lines always end with the same word, and the last four feature an aaab rhyme scheme with slightly lighter syllables that force the pace into a brisk march despite its somber mood (cf. the text of the poem's final chorus). Eliot noted the imperfect rhyme scheme – parade and <b>said</b> <b>do</b> not quite rhyme – as strongly contributing to this effect, with the slight interruption supporting the feel {{of a large number of}} men marching together, not quite in harmony.|$|E
