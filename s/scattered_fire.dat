25|$|Wellington {{ordered an}} assault on the San Miguel hornwork, which guarded the fort's {{northeast}} approaches for the night of 19 September. Launched without the benefit of artillery support, there would be three simultaneous assaults, the 1st Battalion of the 42nd Foot was spotted by the French in the moonlight and over 200 men were mowed down. Brigadier General Denis Pack's Portuguese brigade suffered an additional 100 losses. Fortunately for the British, the flank companies of the 1st/42nd Foot, 1st/24th Foot, and 1st/79th Foot were able {{to gain access to the}} rear of the hornwork. From there they opened a <b>scattered</b> <b>fire</b> on the French. The defenders suddenly stampeded, leaving the hornwork in the Allies' possession. The 1st Battalion of the 34th Line lost 138 killed and wounded, plus 60 men and seven guns were captured. Allied losses numbered 421 killed and wounded.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} midnight Forte slowly {{moved to}} the lee of Sybille, firing a small broadside at long range at the British ship's bow, accompanied by <b>scattered</b> <b>fire</b> from the French prize crews on the merchant ships. Apart from damage to the jib, Sibylle remained unharmed, advancing silently and in darkness. French fire continued with little effect, allowing Cooke to bring Sybille within [...] of the stern of Forte at 12:45 and fire a raking broadside, followed by a second as the British ship pulled alongside the French frigate. The cannon were complemented by musketry from the soldiers aboard, which swept the exposed deck of Forte. The damage to the French ship was catastrophic: guns were smashed from their carriages and dozens of men killed and more wounded, the dead including Beaulieu and his first lieutenant.|$|E

60|$|A {{few moments}} more and {{the bridge was}} drawn back, and Paul Bevan was borne into the hut, amid a <b>scattering</b> <b>fire</b> from the assailants, which, however, did no damage.|$|R
60|$|A <b>scattering</b> <b>fire</b> was {{now being}} {{exchanged}} between the redskins behind {{the shelter of}} the trees and the Americans firing from the windows of the log house. Harold was but two or three minutes absent.|$|R
60|$|As they entered, a <b>scattered</b> <b>fire</b> opened {{upon them}} from the windows, but, without pausing, the band broke up into parties, each under its chief, and rushed at the entrances leading to the staircases.|$|E
6000|$|I {{wish it were}} spring cunningly blowing on {{the fallen}} sparks, odds and [...] ends of the old, <b>scattered</b> <b>fire,</b> and {{kindling}} shapely little conflagrations curious long-legged foals, and wide-eared calves, [...] and naked sparrow-bubs.|$|E
60|$|A {{moment later}} the chain was unshackled, and as the capstan rapidly revolved, the schooner's head receded from the shore. Yells of rage broke from the negroes, and a <b>scattered</b> <b>fire</b> of musketry was opened.|$|E
60|$|From both boats a <b>scattering</b> <b>fire</b> of musketry at once opened, the men {{loading and}} firing {{as quickly as}} they could. The effect was immediate. Arrows still fell, but only occasionally; and evidently shot at random, for but few of them came near the boats.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} they were in {{midstream}} a score of horsemen rode out on the bank they had just left and opened a <b>scattering</b> <b>fire.</b> The party crowded in the shelter of the car and listened to the occasional richochet of a bullet. Once, only, the car was struck.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you suppose}} they have quitted the vicinity?" [...] {{questioned}} Jeming, after listening vainly for some sound from without. From a distance came a <b>scattering</b> <b>fire,</b> {{but around the}} native house was the silence of death, {{for the man who}} had been shot by Sorrel had fainted from loss of blood.|$|R
60|$|For two days, Fadil endeavoured {{to persuade}} his troops {{to make another}} attack; but {{although}} they surrounded the town, and maintained a <b>scattered</b> <b>fire,</b> {{they could not be}} brought to attempt another assault, having lost over five hundred men in the two attacks the first day. He then fell back, eight miles.|$|E
60|$|A <b>scattered</b> <b>fire</b> {{was opened}} at the house soon after daybreak, and was kept up without {{intermission}} from bushes and other cover; but the watchers on the roof, seated behind the sandbags at opposite angles, were well under shelter, peering out occasionally through the crevices between the bags to see that no general movement was taking place among the enemy.|$|E
60|$|Her {{guns were}} already loaded, {{and those on}} board poured a {{broadside}} into the brigantine {{at the end of}} the line. The sailors in the battery were working with might and main to slue all the guns round to bear upon the pirates. On the hillsides above them a <b>scattered</b> <b>fire</b> of musketry was being kept up, and Mr. Hill hailed the schooner.|$|E
3000|$|Turkeypen Ridge Fire—April 1971, 32.4 ha (80 ac). “During {{the night}} of April 19 th, a violent {{thunderstorm}} passed over Cades Cove. On Turkeypen Ridge, {{a bolt of lightning}} struck a large hickory tree and set it to smoldering. April 27 th, in the afternoon, the top of the hickory fell, <b>scattering</b> <b>fire</b> into the dry leaves around it.” [...]...|$|R
60|$|The {{defenders}} {{were not}} idle; all had their allotted {{places at the}} windows, and from these a steady return was kept up in answer to the <b>scattering</b> <b>fire</b> without. Ned had caught up the gun which Mr. Cartwright had laid down when {{he ran to the}} bell rope, and with it he kept up a steady fire at the dark figures below.|$|R
6000|$|Let {{this not}} seem an anti-climax:--"Oh! [...] My guard! my old guard!"[548] exclaimed that god of clay. [...] Think of the Thunderer's falling down below [...] Carotid-artery-cutting Castlereagh![kg] [...] Alas! that glory should be chilled by snow! [...] But should {{we wish to}} warm us on our way [...] Through Poland, there is Kosciusko's name [...] Might <b>scatter</b> <b>fire</b> through ice, like Hecla's flame.|$|R
60|$|Patsey drew herself up, {{struck the}} horse with her whip, and galloped on at full speed. They soon left the road {{followed}} {{by the rest of}} the fugitives, and turned down one leading east. The din of battle had ceased now, but a <b>scattered</b> <b>fire</b> of musketry showed that the enemy were engaged in their usual work of shooting all who fell into their hands.|$|E
60|$|Almayer {{watched the}} canoe till it {{passed out of}} the line of light. Shortly after the murmur of many voices reached him across the water. He could see the torches being {{snatched}} out of the burning pile, and rendering visible for a moment the gate in the stockade round which they crowded. Then they went in apparently. The torches disappeared, and the <b>scattered</b> <b>fire</b> sent out only a dim and fitful glare.|$|E
60|$|During {{these three}} days the Zulus had made many hostile demonstrations against us. On {{the first and}} second they kept up a <b>scattered</b> <b>fire</b> at distant ranges at our men, and on the third, growing bolder, pushed their skirmishers down to the rocks on the {{opposite}} side of the river, and fired upon the men, as they were watering their horses in the stream. One horse was killed and several men wounded.|$|E
60|$|The echoing {{report of}} the gun and the fall of their {{companion}} evidently disconcerted {{the aim of the}} savages, for their <b>scattering</b> <b>fire</b> left the bounding Tim untouched. Before they could reload, Softswan sent them a present of another charge of slugs, which, the distance being great, so scattered itself as to embrace nearly the whole party, who thereupon went wounded and howling back into the forest.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} nearly ten o'clock that the French attack began; then a column moved down from the heights of La Belle Alliance against the wood of Hougoumont, and as it {{approached}} the leading companies broke up into skirmishing order. As these arrived within musketry range a <b>scattering</b> <b>fire</b> broke out from the hedges {{in front of the}} wood, and the battle of Waterloo had begun.|$|R
60|$|The oars all {{touched the}} water together, {{and the four}} boats leapt forward. In a minute a <b>scattering</b> <b>fire</b> of gingals and matchlocks was opened from the junks, and the bullets pattered on the water round the boats. Percy was {{kneeling}} up in the bow now. As they passed a branch channel three or four {{hundred yards from the}} village, he started and leapt to his feet.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as it}} was daybreak a <b>scattered</b> <b>fire</b> opened {{from the}} hills {{on either side of the}} valley, and it was evident that these were {{occupied}} by strong parties. The villagers, on being questioned, denied all knowledge of these bands; but under threats said that they had heard that Minas, with a very strong force, was in the neighbourhood, and that the Impecinado had been reported to be among the hills between the pass and that of Roncesvalles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Follow Me!" [...] he shouted. [...] "Make for the gun!" [...] At {{the first}} volley, the colonel of the dragoons {{and many of}} his men fell. A <b>scattered</b> <b>fire</b> broke out from the defenders. Leigh gave the word and, leaping up, they threw {{themselves}} on the traitor. He was the bearer of terrible news. Jean seized one of them by the throat. Westermann's cavalry charged into the streets of Dol. For two or three minutes, husband and wife stood together.|$|E
60|$|Half an hour passed, {{then the}} head of the column was seen {{descending}} the road. It opened out as it came, forming into a thick line of skirmishers, some two hundred yards wide. Moving along, Leigh spread the musketeers to a similar length of front. At first, the enemy were half hidden by the wood at {{the other side of the}} slope; but as they issued from this, some twenty yards from the stream, a <b>scattered</b> <b>fire</b> broke out from the defenders.|$|E
50|$|The two men {{proceeded}} {{to the location}} {{and were able to}} keep the fire under control. Only a few small <b>scattered</b> <b>fires</b> were started because the bombs were not dropped from the correct height. The men stayed on scene and worked through the night keeping the fires contained. In the morning, a fire crew arrived to help. A recent rain storm had kept the area wet, which helped the fire lookouts contain the blaze.|$|R
60|$|Aroused by {{the sound}} of the sentry's musket, the Russian {{soldiers}} rushed to their windows and doors and opened a <b>scattering</b> <b>fire,</b> which was heavily responded to by the Poles. The midshipmen with their party ran hastily down the village. There were two sentries over the boats, but these, alarmed by the din in the village and the sight of the approaching figures, fired their muskets and fled. Dick uttered a low exclamation.|$|R
60|$|As the lurking Croats and Pandoors had, every night, {{crept up}} through the {{brushwood}} and hollows, and skirmished with the Prussian outposts away on the right, <b>scattered</b> <b>firing</b> was not heeded much in Hochkirch. Fergus had just got up, in the little room he shared with Lindsay in the marshal's quarters, a mile north of Hochkirch; and was putting on his boots when, a few minutes past five, the sound of firing was heard.|$|R
60|$|Here {{and there}} a soldier was {{discharging}} his rifle, but this <b>scattered</b> <b>fire</b> had no effect in checking the mob. On it came, bellowing with brute rage. It seemed the machine-guns could not get started. The automobiles on which they were mounted blocked the street, compelling the soldiers to find positions in, between, and on the sidewalks. More and more soldiers were arriving, and in the jam {{we were unable to}} get away. Garthwaite held me by the arm, and we pressed close against the front of a building.|$|E
60|$|Slowly {{the long}} night passed. All {{along the line}} ahead, a <b>scattered</b> <b>fire</b> of musketry could be heard; as the villagers shot down the fugitives who, in hopes of finding water, straggled from the road. Sometimes sharp volleys rang out, as the troops stood at bay, and drove back the natives, when they pressed upon them. Several times the rear guard were hotly engaged as the Afghans--furious at seeing their prey {{slipping}} from their fingers--mustered and fell upon them; but each time they were repulsed, and the column held on its way.|$|E
60|$|Zeppa had delayed {{a moment}} in order to think for his disordered mind {{had been turned into}} a much-loved channel, that of preaching the Gospel to inquiring sinners. For many years he had been {{training}} himself in the knowledge of the Scriptures, and, being possessed of a good memory, he had got large portions of it by heart. Gathering together the embers of the <b>scattered</b> <b>fire,</b> he sat down again, and, gazing thoughtfully at the flickering flames, began to point out the way of salvation to the pirate.|$|E
60|$|Encouraged by the {{smallness}} of {{the number}} of their assailants, the mutineers, cheered on by their officers, resisted stoutly. A <b>scattering</b> <b>fire</b> opened upon the British from the houses round, and the shouts of the mutineers rose louder and louder, when a heavy volley was suddenly poured into them, and the Punjaubies rushed out from the street facing that by which the British had entered. They bore to the right, and fell upon the body with which Marshall was engaged.|$|R
50|$|Chaves {{then came}} under attack. Augusto Ribeiro de Carvalho hurried {{to recall the}} troops that he had sent out a day earlier; however, he also had local support from the townspeople. 150 {{civilian}} volunteers from Chaves, trained briefly months earlier, hurried to help the authorities against the royalists. The regular soldiers numbered around 100. The battle was one of <b>scattered</b> <b>firing</b> with small arms and casualties were light. The rebels could not penetrate the defenses, nor could the garrison venture out to attack them.|$|R
50|$|Lasered Rifle: The SPT's primary {{weapon is}} a proton laser cannon called a Lasered Rifle. Much {{like a human}} the SPT carries the Rifle in its arms and the Rifle can be stored on its back. In a non-atmospheric {{condition}} the Rifle can easily rip through 100 mm of standard armour, with the power being drawn from either a power clip or directly from the Tracer's main generator. Power output on the rifle can be adjusted from seven different levels including rapid to <b>scattering</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|R
