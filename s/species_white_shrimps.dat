40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the applicability of producing organic shrimp without using any chemicals in Ilan, Taiwan. The trials respectively employed intensive monoculture of two penaeoid <b>species,</b> <b>white</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Litopenaeus vannamei) and kuruma prawn (Marsupenaeus japonicus) and extensive polyculture of kuruma prawn (0. 56 m- 2 stocking density) and grey mullets (500 pcs). Experimental units consisted of three earthen ponds, 900 m 2, 1100 m 2 and 4600 m 2, respectively with a minimal water exchange. No significant effects in shrimp growth were found with the probiotics used in the trials. Although the survival rates for both species in the first two trials were low and obviously affected by the disease outbreaks, the third trial on extensive polyculture with grey mullet achieved a high survival and growth rate (3. 8 g to 37. 3 g) during the 12 weeks culture period. Dissolved oxygen concentration in three ponds fluctuates on a 24 -hour basis, increases during daylight hours and decreases at nighttime even dropping to a critical level of 2. 03 mg/L. The results obtained from those trials indicate that the culture conditions must be carefully maintained. Although our trials did not achieve good results, they can provide some implications for future research. Also, maintaining an organic ecosystem may simply be too difficult for some aquaculture systems. Thus, it would be unrealistic to say that all aquaculture systems, at least for those we currently know, would be suitable for organic certification. However, seeking a balance between aquaculture production and environmental protection will be our ultimate goal...|$|R

In case of this study, objects to be examined were intensive, semi-intensive, and traditional ponds located in Kendal Regency. This study aimed to find out the incidence of WSSV and TSV exposures to the shrimp ponds in Kendal that applied intensive, semi-intensive, and traditional technologies. Using a PCR test and histopathology examination on the <b>White</b> <b>shrimps</b> (Litopenaeus vannamei), the study was carried out from June to September 2009. The study used was a survey method, in which samples were obtained by means of a purposive random sampling. Objects of the sampling consisted of intensive (T 1), semi-intensive (T 2), and traditional (T 3) ponds. These shrimp samples were then subject to a PCR test at BBAP Jepara to investigate exposures or incidents of the WSSV and TSV in the sample animals. The PCR analysis was done descriptively.

The Km values for the oxidation of L-DOPA by <b>white</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Chen et al. [1991 b]) and kuruma prawn (Benjakul et al. [2006]) PPO were 3.48 and 0.26 mM, respectively. PPO from the viscera of Norway lobster showed a higher catalytic affinity for catechol than PPO from the carapace with apparent Km values of 5.97 and 19.40 mM, respectively (Gimenez et al. [2010]). Vmax for the oxidation of L-DOPA by PPO in DEAE-Sephacel fraction was 61 × 103 U/mg PPO. Simpson et al.

However, pre-cooking at high temperature was able to decrease the melanosis in shrimp (Manheem et al. 2012). Heating or pre-cooking at a higher temperature led to the loss in cooking yield. This was mainly associated with the thermal denaturation of the muscle protein in shrimp, particularly the myosin heavy chain (Benjakul et al. 2011). To produce pre-cooked shrimp with a long shelf life, sufficient pre-cooking is required to inactivate PPO, but it may cause the enhanced cooking loss and quality changes of pre-cooked shrimp.

[...] In 1993, Giovanni's (now Giovanni's Original <b>White</b> <b>Shrimp</b> Truck) started serving shrimp from a mobile truck, which set up a permanent location in Kahuku by 1995. In the wake of its success, other trucks followed to sell the area's shrimp as tourism and residential population increased along the North Shore. Those in operation today include Blue Water Shrimp, Famous Kahuku Shrimp Truck, Fumi's Kahuku Shrimp and Seafood, Giovanni's Original <b>White</b> <b>Shrimp</b> Truck, Macky's Kahuku Sweet Shrimp, Romy's Kahuku Prawns and Shrimp Hut and The Shrimp Shack.|$|R
