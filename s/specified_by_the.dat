5000|$|Because the IPA symbol {{stands for}} both the uvular {{fricative}} and the uvular approximant, the fricative nature of this sound may be <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> adding <b>the</b> uptack to the letter: [...] The approximant can be <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> adding <b>the</b> downtack: , though some writings use a superscript , which is not an official IPA practice.|$|R
30|$|If the {{magnitude}} of E is between 8 and 16  kJ mol− 1, the sorption process is supposed to proceed via chemisorption, while for values of E <  8  kJ mol− 1, the sorption process is of physical in nature.

5|$|An aspect weaver is a metaprogramming utility for aspect-oriented {{languages}} {{designed to}} take instructions specified by aspects (isolated representations of a significant concepts in a program) and generate the final implementation code.

Based on recommendations <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Township Council, the Board of Education approved $544,391 in cuts. The school budget was rejected again in 2009, with the Council cutting $1 million from the $94.8 million originally proposed. After the 2010 school budget failed, the Township Council removed $6.1 million from the $95 million budget proposed by the school district, zeroing out {{what would have been}} an 8.2% increase in the school tax levy. The school board eliminated 77 positions to meet the cuts approved by the council.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{released}} the fifth {{edition of the}} DSM (DSM-5). To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, two diagnostic criteria have to be met {{over much of the}} time of a period of at least one month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative symptoms, or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal {{expanded}} the scope of judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive discretion. In contrast to the subjective test, the objective test permits the court to examine whether the decision-maker's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ISA. The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test was only part of the obiter dicta of the case. The ratio decidendi of the case was based on narrower technical grounds.|$|E

5|$|Proteins are {{the chief}} actors within the cell, {{said to be}} {{carrying}} out the duties <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> information encoded in genes. With the exception of certain types of RNA, most other biological molecules are relatively inert elements upon which proteins act. Proteins make up half the dry weight of an Escherichia coli cell, whereas other macromolecules such as DNA and RNA make up only 3% and 20%, respectively. The set of proteins expressed in a particular cell or cell type is known as its proteome.|$|E
5|$|Securing an {{airstrip}} {{would be}} an important objective for the invader. Airfields, considered extremely vulnerable, were protected by trench works and pillboxes which faced inwards towards the runway, rather than outwards. Many of these fortifications were <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Air Ministry and defensive designs were unique to airfields—these would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so the degree of protection was less and there was more emphasis on all-round visibility and sweeping fields of fire. It was difficult to defend large open areas without creating impediments to the movement of friendly aircraft. Solutions to this problem included the pop-up Picket Hamilton fort—a light pillbox that could be lowered to ground level when the airfield was in use.|$|E
5|$|Testing of {{cosmetic}} products on animals is {{banned in the}} member states of the European Community, although France protested the ban and has made efforts to have it lifted. It is permitted in the United States but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods, and the test species is not <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Food and Drug Administration (FDA). When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing. Minnesota was {{the first state to}} enact a Beagle freedom adoption law in 2014, mandating that dogs and cats are allowed to be adopted once they have completed with research testing.|$|E

5|$|The aspect weaver {{analyzes}} the advice <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pointcut in the aspect and uses that advice {{to distribute the}} implementation code into the defined class.

The aspect weaver determines the appropriate code to generate in each situation {{as defined by the}} implementation advice and then injects it into methods matching the specified pointcut.|$|E
