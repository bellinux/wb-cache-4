40|$|The typical AdS/QCD models {{deal with}} the large-N_c limit of QCD, as a {{consequence}} the meson spectrum consists of the infinite number of states that {{is far from the}} real situation. Basing on introduction of anharmonic corrections to the holographic potential, the corrections whose existence has been recently advocated, we construct a class of bottom-up holographic models describing arbitrary finite number of states in the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> mesons. Within the proposed approach, the spectrum of masses square has the following properties: It is linear, m_n^ 2 ∼ n, at not very large n, nonlinear at larger n, with the nonlinear corrections being subleading in 1 /N_c, has a limiting mass, and the number of states is proportional to N_c. The considered holographic models reflect thereby the merging of resonances into continuum and the breaking of gluon string at sufficiently large quark-antiquark separation that causes the linear Regge trajectories to bend down. We show that these models provide a correct description for the spectrum of excited rho-mesons. Comment: 13 pages, 1 figur...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of the mass di erences for systems bound by the strong force has reached a very high precision with protons and anti-protons 1, 2. The extension of such measurement from (anti-) baryons to (anti-) nuclei allows one to probe any di erence in the interactions between nucleons and antinucleons encoded in the (anti-) nuclei masses. This force is a remnant of the underlying strong interaction among quarks and gluons and can be described by e ective theories 3, but cannot yet be directly derived from quantum chromodynamics.

The common origin of gauge trinification and of the family symmetry from E 8 separates the model from other trinification-based GUTs, as it protects, in particular, the Standard Model fermions from gaining mass until the electroweak symmetry is broken. Furthermore, {{it allows us to}} break the trinification symmetry via vacuum expectation values in SU(3) -adjoint scalars down to a left-right symmetric theory. Simultaneously, it ensures the unification of the gauge and Yukawa couplings as well as proton stability.

40|$|We {{attack the}} long-standing problem {{of finding the}} AdS dual of N = 2 superconformal QCD, the N= 2 super Yang Mills theory with gauge group SU(N_c) and N_f = 2 N_c {{fundamental}} hyper multiplets. The theory admits a Veneziano expansion of large N_c and large N_f, with N_f/N_c and lambda = g^ 2 N_c kept fixed. The topological structure of large N diagrams motivates a general conjecture: the flavor-singlet sector of a gauge theory in the Veneziano limit is dual to a closed string theory; single closed string states correspond to "generalized single-trace" operators, where adjoint letters and flavor-contracted fundamental/antifundamental pairs are stringed together in a closed chain. We look for the string dual of N = 2 superconformal QCD from two fronts. From the bottom-up, we perform a systematic analysis of the protected spectrum using superconformal representation theory. We also evaluate the one-loop dilation operator in the scalar sector, finding a novel spin chain. From the top-down, we consider the decoupling limit of known brane constructions. In both approaches, more insight is gained by viewing the theory as the degenerate limit of the N = 2 Z_ 2 orbifold of N = 4 SYM, {{as one of the}} two gauge couplings is tuned to zero. A consistent picture emerges. We conclude that the string dual is a sub-critical background with seven "geometric" dimensions, containing both an AdS_ 5 and an S^ 1 factor. The supergravity approximation is never entirely valid, even for large lambda, indeed the field theory has an exponential degeneracy of exactly protected states with higher spin, which must be dual to a <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> string states.

40|$|The {{question}} {{of the existence of}} glueballs is one of the unsolved problems in modern particle physics and can be regarded as a stringent test for quantum chromodynamics. Especially the supernumerous states in the light scalar meson spectrum are candidates for the observation of mixing effects between qq̅ mesons and pure gluonic bound states. On the other hand, the existence and the properties of many resonances in this sector are disputed. The COMPASS experiment was proposed to make significant contributions to this field. COMPASS is a fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS which focused on light-quark hadron spectroscopy during the data taking periods in 2008 and 2009. A world-leading data set was collected with a 190 GeV/c hadron beam impinging on a liquid hydrogen target in order to study, inter alia, the central production of glueball candidates in the light meson sector. Especially the double-Pomeron exchange mechanism is well suited for the production of mesons without valence-quark content. To this end, we select events with two protons and two pseudo-scalar mesons in the final state from the COMPASS data set recorded with an incident proton beam. Several selection criteria are compared in order to enhance the double-Pomeron component in the centrally produced sample. The angular distribution of the decay of these systems into π^+π^- and K^+K^- is decomposed in terms of partial-wave amplitudes, where particular attention is paid to the inherent mathematical ambiguities. They can be naturally resolved by using the information from the related π^ 0 π^ 0 final state. The resulting distributions yield unprecedented precision, most notably on the relative phase between the partial-wave amplitudes. For the first time, an analysis in narrow bins of the squared four-momentum transfer is possible, which provides information about the dynamics of the production process. Furthermore, we show that a mass-dependent fit of the obtained S-wave intensity distribution alone, as it was done in the past, can be achieved by substantially different models. Only if the intensities of the S- and D-wave amplitudes as well as their relative phase are fitted simultaneously, resonant states can be distinguished from non-resonant background. With this method, we obtain realistic Breit-Wigner parameters for the scalar mesons above 1 GeV/c^ 2, especially in the K^+K^- channel. A combination of the results with precision data from elastic scattering experiments may be able to elucidate the entire <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> scalar mesons...|$|E
