500|$|Less {{than three}} days before the 10,000 m, a special {{commission}} of the IAAF, consisting of the same seven members that had <b>suspended</b> Nurmi, <b>rejected</b> the Finn's entries and barred him from competing in Los Angeles. Sigfrid Edström, president of the IAAF and chairman of its executive council, stated that the full congress of the IAAF, which was scheduled to start the next day, could not reinstate Nurmi for the Olympics but merely review the phases and political angles related to the case. The AP called this [...] "one of the slickest political maneuvers in international athletic history", and wrote that the Games would now be [...] "like Hamlet without the celebrated Dane in the cast." [...] Thousands protested against the action in Helsinki. Details of the case were not released to the press, but the evidence against Nurmi was believed be the sworn statements from German race promoters that Nurmi had received $250–500 per race when running in Germany in autumn 1931. The statements were produced by Karl Ritter von Halt after Edström had sent him increasingly threatening letters, warning that if evidence against Nurmi is not provided, he [...] "will unfortunately have to take stringent action against the German Athletics Association." ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, an {{intermittently}} aerated Membrane bioreactors (MBR) with {{stainless steel}} mesh as filter was developed for simultaneous effective carbon and nitrogen removals. The biofilm attached on mesh filter can effectively <b>reject</b> <b>suspended</b> solids to improve effluent quality. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrogen removal efficiencies of the system were examined at different influent COD/N ratios, dissolved oxygen (DO) levels and aerobic/anoxic time ratios. The reactor achieved COD, NH 4 +-N and total nitrogen (TN) removals over 93. 7 %, 92. 8 % and 79. 5 %, respectively. To get a better insight into this process, a mechanistic mathematical model was developed based on the Activated Sludge Model No. 3 (ASM 3) for the process simulation. The simulation results agreed with the measured data well. The optimization results show that an appropriate DO level in the aerobic phase and a prolonged anoxic time is required to further improve the TN removal...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the fouling {{mechanism}} during silt density index (SDI) measurements of seawater in the seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination process, 11 runs were conducted under constant-pressure (207 kPa) dead-end filtration mode according to the standard protocol for SDI measurement, in which two kinds of 0. 45 μm membranes of different material and seawater samples from the Mediterranean including raw seawater and seawater pre-treated by coagulation followed by sand filtration (CSF) and coagulation followed by microfiltration (CMF) technologies were tested. Fouling mechanisms based on the constant-pressure filtration equation were fully analyzed. For all runs, only t/(V/A) ∼t showed very good linearity (correlation coefficient R 2 > 0. 99) since the first moment of the filtration, indicating that standard blocking rather than cake filtration was the dominant fouling mechanism during the entire filtration process. The very low concentration of <b>suspended</b> solids <b>rejected</b> by MF of 0. 45 μm in seawater was the main reason why a cake layer was not formed. High turbidity removal during filtration indicated that organic colloids retained on and/or adsorbed in membrane pores governed the filtration process (i. e., standard blocking) due to the important contribution of organic substances to seawater turbidity in this study. Therefore the standard blocking coefficient k s, i. e., the slope of t/(V/A) ∼t, {{could be used as}} a good fouling index for seawater because it showed good linearity with feed seawater turbidity. The correlation of SDI with k s and feed seawater quality indicated that SDI could be reliably used for seawater with low fouling potential (SDI 15 minseawater pre-treated by CSF>seawater pre-treated by CMF, indicating the better performance of CMF than CSF. © 2012 Elsevier B.

5000|$|The patient {{tells the}} team that {{he got into the}} Army to find out how his father, also a soldier, {{actually}} died. While telling the team this, they notice bleeding from his eyes and hands, blood in his urine, and an enlarged spleen. The team do an emergency operation to release more blood from his spleen but find his spleen to be lumpy. After House makes Taub guess several explanations during the D/Dx, he eventually comes up with sarcoidosis. While the DDx is going on, House and Taub are playing a game and House loses, Adams suggests that this is another example of House's impaired coordination. Park agrees with this, but Chase says that it's ironic that they're talking about a whistle blower while [...] "Blowing the Whistle" [...] on House. The patient decides to announce on live TV why he showed the video tape for which he was found treasonous, and unless he is granted this, he won't accept treatment. Chase, Taub and Foreman suggest his older brother sign a form to be his conservator. House decides to give the patient an offer he can't refuse, so they manage to get the Army to declassify the pages from his father's record. During this, Taub tricks House into providing a stool sample which proves his liver is failing. This then leads to a double DDx for the patients and for House. House says that their result isn't real. They decide to go straight to Foreman. Chase argues this puts patients at risk due to House being <b>suspended</b> if he <b>rejects</b> treatment.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 An {{information}} processing {{model of the}} problem-solving performance of mechanical designers is presented for four design tasks: conceptual assembly design, layout component design, detail component design, and catalog selection. These tasks are organized into six kinds of segments called episodes, which describe the goal structure of the designer while performing the task. The episodes are identified as plan, assimilation, specification, verification, repair, and documentation. The basic building blocks that designers apply during these episodes are known as operators, of which ten have been identified: select, create, simulate, compare, calculate, accept, <b>reject,</b> <b>suspend,</b> refine, and patch. These operators are applied in groups which comprise four local methods, identified as generate-and-test, generate-and-improve, deductive thinking, and means -end-analysis. These operators applied according to these methods constitute local design performance. Identifying these processes isolates which functions need to be performed by intelligent computer-aided design tools for assisting mechanical designers. Observations of global design performance, independent of task type, are also presented under nine topics. For example, designers often pursue a single conceptual design, and designers find satisfactory rather than optimal solutions to design problems. These observations provide insight as to the flexibility and level of intelligence actually needed of CAD tools as well as establishing differences between observed design performance and present design methodologies. A comparison of this research to other studies in mechanical design is also presented to solidify what is known or not known about mechanical design. This information has never previously been assimilated into coordinated and specific statements. These descriptions of the mechanical design process {{are based on the}} case studies of five mechanical designers, gathered through verbal protocol techniques of cognitive psychology. A data management technique called breakdown analysis was applied to over 36 hours of protocol data to identify the tasks, episodes, and operators that describe the process of mechanical-design performance...|$|R
