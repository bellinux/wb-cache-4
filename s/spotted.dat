Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that <b>spotted</b> hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the <b>spotted</b> hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view <b>spotted</b> hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, <b>spotted</b> hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Protein <b>spot</b> {{detection}} is {{an important}} step in gel image analysis. The results of <b>spot</b> detection may substantially influence gel image analysis. One of the most challenges of <b>spot</b> detection is separation of <b>spots</b> from complex region, where <b>spots</b> are overlapped and saturated. In this paper, we propose a <b>spot</b> detection algorithm which is capable of detection of <b>spots</b> from complex region. The proposed approach is realized by using European distance transform and centroid marker based watershed. Firstly, we apply a standard marker-controlled watershed algorithm to roughly segment the gel image into multiple regions. For those complex region containing several overlapped <b>spots,</b> we estimate <b>spot</b> centroids through a European distance transform. The estimated centroids are then served as <b>spot</b> markers in marker-controlled watershed algorithm to make a fine <b>spot</b> segmentation. Experimental results show the proposed method can obtain high detection performance in real gel images, and can accurately identify overlapped <b>spots</b> in complex region, when compared to other popular <b>spot</b> detection methods...|$|R

5|$|<b>Spotted</b> hyenas {{have also}} been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, black rhino, hippo calves, young African elephants, {{pangolins}} and pythons. There {{is at least one}} record of four hyenas killing an adult or subadult hippopotamus in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European <b>spotted</b> hyenas primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. <b>Spotted</b> hyenas are thought to be responsible for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for hyenas, especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. <b>Spotted</b> hyenas may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites.

5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the black woodpecker, great <b>spotted</b> woodpecker, middle <b>spotted</b> woodpecker, lesser <b>spotted</b> woodpecker, European green woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and middle <b>spotted</b> woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood {{is likely to be the}} major factor explaining the population increase of these species.|$|E
5|$|The dorsal spots {{make the}} <b>spotted</b> eagle ray an {{aquarium}} attraction, although {{because of its}} large size it is likely kept only at public aquariums. There are no target fisheries for the <b>spotted</b> eagle ray, but it is often eaten after being caught unintentionally as bycatch. There have been several reported incidents of <b>spotted</b> eagle rays leaping {{out of the water}} onto boats and landing on people. Nevertheless, <b>spotted</b> eagle rays do not pose a significant threat to humans, as they are shy and generally avoid human contact. Interactions with an individual snorkeler in the Caribbean has been reported especially in Jamaica involving one, two and even three <b>spotted</b> eagle rays. The rays may exhibit a behavior similar to human curiosity which allows the snorkeler to observe the eagle ray who may slow down so as to share more time with the much slower human observer if the human observer appears to be unthreatening or interesting to the <b>spotted</b> eagle ray.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Design and {{estimate}} {{the impacts of}} a prevention program for part 1 violent crimes in micro-place crime hot <b>spots.</b> Methods: A longitudinal study of crime hot <b>spots</b> using 21 years of crime offense report data on part 1 violent crimes from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Based on kernel density smoothing for a definition of micro-place crime hot <b>spots,</b> we replicate past work {{on the existence of}} “chronic” hot <b>spots,</b> but then with such hot <b>spots</b> accounted for introduce “temporary” hot <b>spots.</b> Results: Chronic hot <b>spots</b> are good targets for prevention. They are easily identified and they tend to persist. Temporary hot <b>spots,</b> however, predominantly last only one month. Thus the common practice of identifying hot <b>spots</b> using a short time window of crime data and assuming that the resulting hot <b>spots</b> will persist is ineffective for temporary hot <b>spots.</b> Instead it is necessary to forecast the emergence of temporary hot <b>spots</b> to prevent their crimes. Over time chronic hot <b>spots,</b> while still important, have accounted for less crime while temporary hot <b>spots</b> have grown, accounting for a larger share. Chronic hot <b>spots</b> are relatively easy targets for police whereas temporary hot <b>spots</b> require forecasting methods not commonly in use by police.

Europe experienced a massive loss of lowland habitats favoured by <b>spotted</b> hyenas, and a corresponding increase in mixed woodlands. <b>Spotted</b> hyenas, under these circumstances, would have been outcompeted by wolves and humans which were as much at home in forests as in open lands, and in highlands as in lowlands. <b>Spotted</b> hyena populations began to shrink roughly 20,000 years ago, completely disappearing from Western Europe between 14–11,000 years ago, and earlier in some areas.|$|E

5|$|A single <b>spotted</b> hyena can eat {{at least}} 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although <b>spotted</b> hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, <b>spotted</b> hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. <b>Spotted</b> hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. <b>Spotted</b> hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E

5|$|Both Björn Kurtén and Camille Arambourg {{promoted}} an Asiatic origin for the species; Kurtén focussed {{his arguments}} on the Plio-Pleistocene taxon Crocuta sivalensis from the Siwaliks, a view defended by Arambourg, who nonetheless allowed {{the possibility of}} an Indo-Ethiopian origin. This stance was contested by Ficarelli and Torre, who referred to evidence of the <b>spotted</b> hyena's presence from African deposists dating from the early Pleistocene, a similar age to the Asian C. sivalensis. Studies on the phylogeographic distribution of mtDNA haplotypes indicates three migration events from Africa to Eurasia, though neither the topology of the phylogenetic tree or the fossil record exclude {{the possibility of an}} Asian origin. The earliest migration of <b>spotted</b> hyenas from Africa to Eurasia began less than 3.5 million years ago, most probably from the area where the first <b>spotted</b> hyena fossils were discovered, reaching East Asia and most likely also Pakistan.

The third <b>spotted</b> hyena migration took place 0.36 million years ago, starting from the northern African population and reaching both Europe and Asia.

5|$|Compared {{to other}} hyenas, the <b>spotted</b> hyena shows a greater {{relative}} amount of frontal cortex which {{is involved in}} the mediation of social behavior. Studies strongly suggest convergent evolution in <b>spotted</b> hyena and primate intelligence. A study done by evolutionary anthropologists demonstrated that <b>spotted</b> hyenas outperform chimpanzees on cooperative problem-solving tests; captive pairs of <b>spotted</b> hyenas were challenged to tug two ropes in unison to earn a food reward, successfully cooperating and learning the maneuvers quickly without prior training. Experienced hyenas even helped inexperienced clan-mates to solve the problem. In contrast, chimps and other primates often require extensive training, and cooperation between individuals is not always as easy for them. The intelligence of the <b>spotted</b> hyena was attested to by Dutch colonists in 19th-century South Africa, who noted that hyenas were exceedingly cunning and suspicious, particularly after successfully escaping from traps. <b>Spotted</b> hyenas seem to plan on hunting specific species in advance; hyenas have been observed to indulge in activities such as scent marking before setting off to hunt zebras, a behaviour which does not occur when they target other prey species. Also, <b>spotted</b> hyenas have been recorded to utilise deceptive behaviour, including giving alarm calls during feeding when no enemies are present, thus frightening off other hyenas and allowing them to temporarily eat in peace. Similarly, mothers will emit alarm calls in attempting to interrupt attacks on their cubs by other hyenas.|$|E
