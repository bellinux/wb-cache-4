25|$|These {{modelling}} exercises {{provide insight}} into the relationships between the deformation styles we observe today and the processes that are responsible for these end-results. In order to perform the numerical and analogue simulations, data had to be collected in order to describe the geomechanical properties of the various tectonostratigraphic units and environments that characterise the Majella anticline and its bordering area. Representative <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> by the various operational units of the Project and laboratory deformation experiments were performed in Eni and in NorskHydro mechanical laboratories.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 an {{improved}} experiment {{was conducted by}} ISRO. On April 20, 2005, air <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> from the upper atmosphere at altitudes ranging from 20km to more than 40km. The samples were tested at two labs in India. The labs found 12 bacterial and 6 different fungal species in these samples. The fungi were Penicillium decumbens, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Alternaria sp. and Tilletiopsis albescens. Out of the 12 bacterial samples, three were identified as new species and named Janibacter hoylei (after Fred Hoyle), Bacillus isronensis (named after ISRO) and Bacillus aryabhattai (named after the ancient Indian mathematician, Aryabhata). These three new species showed {{that they were more}} resistant to UV radiation than similar bacteria.|$|E

25|$|On 24 March 1984, Bolte was {{involved}} in a serious head-on accident when he was driving home after an evening in the local hotel near his property at Bamganie. Bolte and the occupants of the other car were taken to the Ballarat Base Hospital, where blood samples were taken to test for alcohol levels. Whilst {{there was no evidence of}} alcohol in the blood of the other driver involved, there were indications of an alcohol content in excess of 0.05% in Bolte's blood. Subsequently, further <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> from the hospital by the police, but these were found to have been substituted, and the sample box containing them had been unlocked by an unknown person. An enquiry found that it would have been unfair to proceed with prosecution because of interference with the evidence.|$|E
25|$|On 30 September 2011, the Japanese Ministry of Education and Science {{published}} {{the results of}} a plutonium fallout survey, for which in June and July 50 soil <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> from a radius of slightly more than 80km around the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Plutonium was found in all samples, which is to be expected since plutonium from the nuclear weapon tests of the 1950s and '60s is found everywhere on the planet. The highest levels found (of Pu-239 and Pu-240 combined) were 15becquerels per square meters in Fukushima prefecture and 9.4Bq in Ibaraki prefecture, compared to a global average of 0.4 to 3.7 bq / kg from atomic bomb tests. Earlier in June, university researchers detected smaller amounts of plutonium in soil outside the plant after they collected samples during filming by NHK.|$|E
25|$|The coal {{deposits}} at Kongsfjorden {{were first}} discovered by Jonas Poole during a whaling expedition {{in the area}} in 1610. They did not receive more careful analysis until 1861, when Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand on Otto Torell's expedition carried out surveys. Additional <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> by a Swedish expedition in 1870. A/S Bergen–Spitsbergen Kulgrubekompani was founded in 1901 and, led by Skipper Bernhard Pedersen, laid claims at both Kings Bay and Adventfjorden. The claims at Kings Bay were never properly followed up as the company instead chose to focus on its other find. Ernest Mansfield claimed to have made claims to coal fields {{on the south side of}} Kongsfjorden in 1905 and 1906, which were sold to The Northern Exploration Co. Ltd. in 1910. During a scientific expedition in 1909 and 1910, later professor Olaf Holterdahl conducted geological sampling. In the ensuring five years, Green Harbour Coal Co. sent expeditions from Green Harbour. This included the construction of a test shaft. A hut was built in 1912 by the expedition on MK Onsø.|$|E

2500|$|Further, Wilby {{submitted}} {{that the}} Council committed {{a criminal act}} when they allowed the movement of toxic waste without a licence: in 1986 there was no proper permission in place for moving the contaminated waste, only for moving 'inert' waste. Inspectors were not told {{the true nature of}} the substances involved and so took only sporadic samples from the site. Wilby said that the council had deliberately ignored the advice from experts to properly analyse the site because it was going to be an expensive task. He said: [...] "They decided they were going to do this 'dig-and-dump'. They thought 'we have got this great deal of land and all this spoil on this site which must be contaminated, we have got to get it off there because we'll never be able to sell it.'"
