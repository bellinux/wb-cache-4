Land use planning techniques and tools such as zoning and subdivision regulations, as well as special solar zones and planned unit developments have been discussed as they relate to <b>protection</b> of <b>solar</b> access and solar energy use. This paper has distinguished between two types of solar energy systems, active and passive, and associated problems with each. Primary concerns for the users of solar energy systems have been the availability of solar energy and its access to the collector's surface.

40|$|Excessive {{exposure}} to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation {{is the main}} cause of skin cancer. The dose-response between UV exposure and skin cancer occurrence is not yet fully understood since UV exposure is highly heterogeneous and strongly influenced by host and behavioural factors, such as posture, orientation to the sun, skin complexion and clothing. To address this issue, a three-dimensional (3 D) numeric model (SimUVEx) has been developed to assess dose and distribution of anatomical UV exposure. The model uses 3 D computer graphics techniques to compute UV radiance on the basis of postural information and ambient irradiation data, without necessitating time-consuming individual dosimetry, ensuring a wide potential use in skin cancer prevention and research. With the purpose to improve simulation capabilities in order to obtain more realistic scenarios and quantify effective sun protection strategies, a new version has been released, SimUVEX v 2.

We selected three different styles of hat (cap, wide-brimmed hat and helmet) to compare scenarios with and without <b>solar</b> <b>protections</b> considering the relative contribution of the direct, diffuse and reflected radiation.
