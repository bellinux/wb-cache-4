40|$|The {{central focus}} is on the testing of the causes and effects of <b>export</b> <b>earnings</b> {{instability}} <b>in</b> Brazil, 1953 - 1983. While Brazil has been included in some cross-sectional studies of fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>export</b> <b>earnings,</b> it has not been the subject of a case study, as is provided here. We test the traditional theory which stipulates that increased diversification of exports will decrease <b>export</b> <b>earnings</b> instability, and that in turn, a decrease <b>in</b> <b>export</b> <b>earnings</b> instability will enhance economic growth. While we do find that <b>export</b> diversification <b>in</b> Brazil did result <b>in</b> lower <b>export</b> <b>earnings</b> instability, the lower <b>export</b> <b>earnings</b> instability did not in turn stimulate economic growth. Our results indicate that the <b>export</b> <b>earnings</b> instability of manufactured goods was positively associated with the growth rate of Brazil's Gross National Product.

40|$|Export {{diversification}} is {{an important}} lever for the economic growth due to its pivotal role <b>in</b> avoiding the <b>shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> <b>export</b> concentration. For instance, the sensitivity of export revenues to any shock may occur to a certain sector leading to underinvestment when investors avoid the risks. Thus, diversifying export items into different products within different sectors rather than concentrating on certain products in one sector may achieve the sustainability of <b>export</b> <b>earnings.</b> The role of export diversification can be proved {{in the light of}} success of East Asian "Tigers " such as South Korea, where the export diversification has been adopted over the last five decades with fruitful economic returns. However, some Central American countries, such as Costa Rica, applied different diversification programs in the early of 1970 s and lately 1990 s without attaining the stability <b>in</b> their <b>export</b> <b>earnings.</b> Thus, this paper aims to investigate the reasons behind the successful implementation of <b>export</b> diversification policy <b>in</b> South Korea by exploring the determinants of export diversification at all margins through developing a composite index of both export product and geographical diversification using the most common measurement, Hir-schmann-Herfindahl index, and Vector Error Correction Model in order to analysis the time series data over the period (1970 - 2010) based on Eviews 7. 0...|$|R

40|$|Malawi, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe depend {{heavily on}} <b>export</b> <b>earnings</b> from a narrow base of {{agricultural}} commodities (coffee, cotton, sugar, tea, and tobacco). This dependence increased between 1961 - 1973 and 1974 - 1987, when international prices for those commodities were declining and unstable. Policymakers {{concerned with the}} instability and downward trend <b>in</b> <b>export</b> <b>earnings</b> for the three countries, tend to equate these trends with the countries'narrow export commodity base. They often propose export diversification as an expedient remedy. But the authors found that horizontal diversification would have produced lower <b>export</b> <b>earnings</b> and more instability. Policymakers introducing horizontal diversification must first consider price forecasts, comparative advantage, the economy's changing structure, {{and the costs of}} adjustment. Reactions to historical price movements can produce unexpected, undesirable results. A shift during this period from favorable to unfavorable price trends, and shifts in the covariances of deviations from price trends, complicate the design of export diversification policies, especially policies aimed at stabilizing <b>export</b> <b>earnings.</b> Generally, {{the most effective way to}} achieve growth and stability <b>in</b> <b>export</b> <b>earnings</b> is to increase and stabilize agricultural production and the volume of exports.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a leading indicator of external debt servicing vulnerability that would serve as an advance signal of payments interruption. The traditional and widely used ratios of debt servicing capacity, such as the ratio of the balance on current account of debt service payment, and the ratio of external debt to exports among others, primarily measure a country’s current capacity to handle its international obligations. However, they fail to test the vulnerability to debtor countries to oncoming debt servicing problems, or to signal in advance an imminent situation of payments interruption. The proposed index combines a number of variables which have preceded payments interruption by a number of countries in recent years. These situations have been preceded with a varying time lead by all or most of the following developments: 1. A significant erosion in the international liquidity position. 2. A sharply faster growth rate of external debt than the rate of growth <b>in</b> <b>export</b> <b>earnings.</b> 3. An acceleration in the inflation rate experienced by the country. 4. A <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> <b>exports</b> or a deterioration <b>in</b> <b>export</b> performance. 5. Adverse internal political developments. The complied index is a weighted average of sub-indices or ratios which measure recent changes in the variables listed above. The index was applied to 20 developing countries (LDCs) accounting for about 80 percent of total external debt. Depending on their score, these countries were grouped in five categories ranging from those signaling significant improvement in their debt servicing capacity to those signaling an imminent payments interruption. © 1985 JIBS.

40|$|Since independence, Pakistan, {{like many}} other countries, has been facing {{the problem of the}} balance-of-payments deficit. A number of {{policies}} have been introduced during different periods for rapid and continuous growth <b>in</b> Pakistan’s <b>exports.</b> These policies, like import substitution, devaluation of the rupee <b>in</b> 1972, <b>export</b> finance schemes, tax concessions, delinking of the rupee from the U. S. dollar in 1982, etc., have helped <b>in</b> boosting its <b>exports</b> to some extent but not enough to stabilise its <b>export</b> <b>earnings.</b> The fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>export</b> <b>earnings</b> are known to have serious consequences. Specifically, unstable <b>export</b> <b>earnings</b> affect the investment decisions by hindering the continuous import of industrial raw materials. This, in turn, impedes the growth of the industrial sector. Moreover, it causes fluctuations in the GNP and promotes uncertainty in the economy. This uncertainty plays a decisive role in the private sector’s hesitation to invest in the large-scale manufacturing industries, thereby hampering the country’s overall development. Keeping in view the possibly serious consequences of <b>export</b> <b>earnings</b> instability, a study exploring its causes is in order. Concentration of exports on a few commodities and exporting to only a few markets is among the possible explanations of the current instability <b>in</b> Pakistan’s <b>export</b> <b>earnings.</b> Due to commodity concentration, the chances of offsetting the impact of adverse price movements in the international market are reduced. This commodity concentration is often associated with the concentration on primary products and is, therefore, the basis for a policy of diversification away from primary products. A diversification away from primary products and towards industrial goods is desirable for another reason, not central to this paper; {{and that is that the}} terms of trade argument which claims that the relative prices of the primary products have increased slowly relative to the prices of the manufactured goods in the international market. ...|$|R
