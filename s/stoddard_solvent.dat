50|$|<b>Stoddard</b> <b>solvent</b> is a {{specific}} mixture of hydrocarbons, typically > 65% C10 or higher hydrocarbons, developed in 1924 by Atlanta dry cleaner W. J. Stoddard and Lloyd E. Jackson of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research as a less volatile petroleum-based dry cleaning solvent than the petroleum solvents then in use. Dry cleaners began using the result of their work in 1928 and it soon became the predominant dry cleaning solvent in the United States, until the late 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Modern dry cleaning's use of non-water-based {{solvents}} {{to remove}} soil and stains from clothes was reported {{as early as}} 1855. The potential for petroleum-based solvents was recognized by French dye-works operator Jean Baptiste Jolly, who offered a new service that became known as nettoyage à sec—i.e., dry cleaning. Flammability concerns led William Joseph Stoddard, a dry cleaner from Atlanta, to develop <b>Stoddard</b> <b>solvent</b> (white spirit) as a slightly less flammable alternative to gasoline-based solvents. The use of highly flammable petroleum solvents caused many fires and explosions, resulting in government regulation of dry cleaners. After World War I, dry cleaners began using chlorinated solvents. These solvents were much less flammable than petroleum solvents and had improved cleaning power.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the late}} 60's, many methods of parts {{cleaning}} {{have been developed}} with improved levels of safety and lessened environmental impact. <b>Stoddard</b> <b>solvent,</b> gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene were commonly used to clean and degrease parts. Then, chlorinated solvents in vapor degreasers became an industry standard. During the 1980s environmental and safety issues led to the banning of chlorinated solvents for parts cleaning. Aqueous-based cleaning systems took on new prominence that led to many improvements, in the systems and the processes. In 1971, Gary Minkin developed an aqueous based parts washer for degreasing automobile parts. The Minkin breakthrough used the force of hydraulic impact pressure to significantly improve the cleaning power of the aqueous parts washer.|$|E
5000|$|Petroleum benzine is a {{hydrocarbon}} based solvent mixture that {{is classified}} by its physical properties (e.g. boiling point, vapor pressure) {{rather than a}} specific chemical composition, often obfuscating distinction within {{the long list of}} petroleum distillate solvent mixtures: mineral spirits, naphtha, white spirits, petroleum spirits, turps substitute, mineral turpentine, petroleum benzine, petroleum ether, ligroin, and <b>Stoddard</b> <b>Solvent.</b> The chemical composition of a petroleum distillate can also be modified to afford a solvent with reduced concentration of unsaturated hydrocarbons, i.e. alkenes, by hydrotreating and/or reduced aromatics, e.g. benzene, toluene xylene, by several dearomatization methods. In a document that attempts to draw more concise distinctions between hydrocarbon solvents, conservator Alan Phenix explains that the most important distinction amongst the various hydrocarbon solvents are their boiling/distillation ranges (and, by association, volatility, flash point etc.) and aromatic content. Given the toxicity/carcinogenicity of some aromatic hydrocarbons, most notably benzene, the aromatic content of petroleum distillate solvents, which would normally be in the 10-25% (w/w) range for most petroleum fractions, can be advantageously reduced when their special solvation properties are not required and a less odorous, lower toxicity solvent is desired, especially when present in consumer products. Phenix further points out that [...] "To all intents and purposes petroleum benzine appears synonymous with petroleum spirit." [...] Petroleum spirit is generally considered to be the fractions between the very lightest hydrocarbons, petroleum ether, and the heavier distillates, mineral spirits. For example, petroleum benzine with a boiling range of 36 - 83 °C sold by EMD Millipore under CAS-No. 64742-49-0 is identified in the product MSDS as hydrotreated light petroleum distillates comprising ≥ 90% C5-C7 hydrocarbons, n-alkanes, isoalkanes, and < 5% n-hexane, while Santa Cruz Biotechnology sells a petroleum ether product under the same CAS-No. Fisher Scientific offers a product ‘Benzine (Petroleum Naphtha)' that retails for a high price that would suggest it is a speciality product but in fact conforms to Marathon Petroleum's 'VM&P Naphtha' (Varnish Makers & Painters’ Naphtha) found widely distributed in many hardware stores in North America.|$|E

40|$|The Ideal Drycleaners site {{consists}} of an abandoned and demolished former drycleaning facility. The facility is situated in downtown Livingston on about 0. 4 acres (17, 300 ft 2) in a mixed-use, residential and commercial block. The drycleaner property is flat; however, the grade {{of the street and}} adjacent properties is such that runoff drains south, then west to a storm water network which is routed to a channelized tributary of Town Creek. Ideal began drycleaning operations in the 1940 's and ceased in 1983. The facility mainly used <b>stoddard</b> <b>solvent</b> but also used tetrachloroethylene (PCE) during its operation. It also operated a fuel island for its fleet of delivery trucks. No records of solvent usage rates, wastes, or disposal for the operation were found. During demolition, three aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) were observed, and two underground storage tanks (USTs) were discovered at the site. One UST was ruptured and released its contents to the soil and drainage network. Four additional USTs were later found at the site. PCE in free-product form was detected in one tank, all others contained mostly water contaminated with petroleum products, including <b>stoddard</b> <b>solvent.</b> Historical releases are assumed to have occurred through leaking tanks, the leaking pipes, and spills around filling ports and distribution points.
