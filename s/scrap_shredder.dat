The development of fish <b>scraps</b> <b>shredding</b> and mixing machine {{can be of}} great help {{to the production of}} fish emulsion fertilizer in both quality and quantity. The study specifically covered the design, development and performance evaluation of the fish <b>scraps</b> <b>shredding</b> and mixing machine that was employed for fish emulsion fertilizer production. Preliminary tests were performed to establish operating conditions of the machine such as working capacity, shredding speed, mixing speed, mixing time and mixing capacity. The working capacity was found to be 750 g of fish <b>scraps.</b> The <b>shredding</b> speed established was based on the variable frequency drive (VFD) at 50 Hz which corresponds to 1800 rpm. The actual performance of the machine was evaluated by determining the shredding rate and efficiency. Based from the results gathered from the performance evaluation of the machine, the shredding efficiency rate and efficiency was 164. 19 g/s and 91. 64 %, respectively. The mixing capacity was 12 kg of fish scraps and molasses with an acceptable mixing speed of 108 rpm, and a mixing time of 40 sec. For a 12 kg of fermented fish scraps and molasses mixture, the fish emulsion fertilizers extracted had a total mass of 8. 2 kg which represented 68. 33 % yield for the mixture.

This area was contaminated accidentally by the addition of auto <b>scrap</b> <b>shredding</b> to the soil and was limed later to reduce heavy metal mobility in the environment. Previous characterization showed that it also presents high concentration of boron, which has limited the initial plant development of some species. As sunflower plants require a high boron supply and the literature describes its use in the phytoremediation of soils contaminated with heavy metals under some conditions, the aim of this work was to evaluate its potential for the remediation of this area. In the present study, the results of preliminary tests are presented, aiming at the evaluation of sunflower plant germination and its initial development when cultivated in the contaminated soil described. Two sunflower hybrids were sown in soils treated with different rates of boron and in the soil from the contaminated area in study. The results showed that sunflower plants had a normal initial development, even in the soil from the contaminated area.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A three-layer {{cover system}} {{consisting}} of a barrier layer, drainage layer, and a cover layer is commonly used to cap abandoned landfills, and {{it was hypothesized that}} <b>shredded</b> <b>scrap</b> tires could serve as an effective drainage media for such systems. To evaluate the transmissivity (flow capacity per unit cross sectional area in the lateral direction) of a <b>shredded</b> <b>scrap</b> tire drainage layer in a landfill cover system, laboratory transmissivity tests were performed using two different size tire shreds, large (TS 1) and small (TS 2), that were subjected to simulated landfill cover conditions. The effects of normal stress and the use of a geotextile at the top, bottom, or at both interfaces of the three layer-simulated cover system were investigated. The transmissivity was high and remained almost the same in the tests when the geotextile was used at both the interfaces. In the case when there was no geotextile at the top interface, however, the amount of soil migration into the voids of the tire shreds from the cover soil layer was high. The absence of the geotextile at the bottom interface had a minimal effect on the transmissivity, but the absence of the geotextile at this interface may cause the protrusion of <b>shredded</b> <b>scrap</b> tires into the barrier layer. Based on the results and observations in this study, the presence of a geotextile at the interfaces, irrespective of the tire shred size and stress conditions, prevented a reduction in the performance of the drainage layer...|$|R
40|$|Each {{year in the}} United States land slips occur under road {{embankments}} {{because a}} weak plane in the in-situ soil is overloaded and fails. One preferred repair technique is to return the road to its original elevation using a lightweight fill instead of normal soil. When properly done, this technique prevents the road structure from overloading the weak slip plane again. In the past, sawdust or chipped lumber {{has been used as}} the fill material. However, these materials tend to rot in repeated wet/dry cycles and are becoming more expensive with the rising cost of wood fiber. This technology brief provides information on a viable alternative to conventional lightweight fill ⎯ using <b>shredded</b> <b>scrap</b> tires. Tires As Lightweight Embankments Road embankments have the potential to use an enormous quantity of tires. For example, an eightmile, 20 -foot embankment for a two-lane road would use approximately 50, 000 tires.

50|$|In 1986, slit rolling was {{introduced}} to Hadeed's Rolling Mills, increasing the daily production record by more than 21%. In 1987, a <b>scrap</b> car <b>shredder</b> plant was commissioned. With a capacity of 50 tonnes per hour, it shreds cars into pieces small enough to be charged into the electric arc furnaces. In 1988, Hadeed introduced a new technology (Bar Quenching) to its rolling mills in Jubail for the manufacture of concrete reinforcing bars. This process involves high pressure surface quenching followed by self-tempering. As the bar emerges from the last rolling stand, the surface temperature is rapidly reduced by high pressure water jets. This action causes change in the microstructure of the steel, making it harder and stronger. Subsequently the heat retained in the core dissipates out and heats the surface to around 620 °C causing another change in the microstructure, which improves the ductility and toughness of the bar. This process can meet increasing demands from structural engineers for higher yield strength combined with good ductility and weldability in reinforcing steel to reduce construction costs.|$|R

Performance of various physico-chemical characteristics of leachate after passing it through combined bed of scrap-tire-shreds and gravel for different combinations of thickness of scrap-tireshreds and gravel and for different variations of width of scrap-tire-shreds was studied. Best combination with the most suitable size and the percentage improvement in terms of reduction in various physico-chemical parameters of leachate samples was identified. Thus emphasized on using scrap-tire-shreds as potential alternative to conventional gravel in the drainage layer of leachate collection system for treating leachate and this would reduce the magnitude of the current tire disposal problem and convert one waste into a beneficial material.
