50|$|Quotron’s success {{attracted}} the attention of Robert S. Sinn, who observed its disadvantages: it could only give a last price. The opening price, high and low for the day, and share volume were not available. His system received the ticker transmissions from the various stock and commodity exchanges. These were then automatically interpreted by a hard wired digital computer updating a drum memory with the last sale prices {{and at the same time}} computing and updating highs and lows and total volume for each stock. As these items were updated a data packet would be generated for transmission by AT&T Dataphone at 1000 bits/second to identical magnetic drum storage devices in each major city in the United States. These slave drum memory units located in the metropolitan centers in the US could then be accessed by desk units in local stock brokerage offices again using Dataphone transmission. The desk units would set up the ticker symbol code for the desired stock by mechanical means actuating micro switches. The local control box would continuously interrogate each desk unit in sequence and send a request data packet by Dataphone to the local drum memory which would then send return data packets back to the local brokerage office. Each packet both for request and answer would contain the request stock alphabetic symbols plus a desk unit identifier. Because the desk units set up the requested stock code statically the desk unit would automatically update the stock price, volume, and highs and lows without any operator intervention because the control unit could complete the interrogation of all desk units in the office in about every one or two seconds, This is the first use of data packet transmission with the <b>sender’s</b> <b>identification</b> imbedded in the data packet in order to avoid switching- a forerunner of the internet?

By appropriately choosing the number of connection identifiers per connection, these schemes lead to a large reduction in the buffer requirements and an effective utilization of the VPI/VCI space. Based on extensive simulations, we show that by using two connection identifiers per connection, there is an 80 % reduction in buffer requirements for DMVC and FMVC when compared to the buffer required for traditional VC-Merge...|$|E

40|$|Our {{world of}} people and objects {{is on the verge}} of {{transforming}} to a world of highly-interconnected wireless devices. Incredible advances in wireless communications, hardware design, and power storage have facilitated hasty spread of wireless technologies in human life. In this new world, individuals are often identified and reached via one or multiple wireless devices that they always carry (e. g., smartphones, smart wearable, implantable medical devices, etc.), and their biometrics identities are replaced by their digital fingerprints. In near future, vehicles will be controlled and monitored via wireless monitoring systems and various physical objects (e. g., home appliance and retail store items) will be connected to the Internet. The list of these changes goes on. Unfortunately, as different aspects of our lives are being immerged in and dependent to wireless devices and services, we will become more vulnerable to wireless service/connection interruptions due to adversarial behavior and our privacy will become more potent to be exposed to adversaries. An adversary can learn the procedures of a wireless system and analyze its stages, and accordingly, launch various attacks against the operations of the system or the privacy of the people. Existing data confidentiality and integrity services (e. g., advanced encryption algorithms) have been able to prevent the leakage of users' messages. However, in wireless networks, even when upper-layer payloads are encrypted, the users' privacy and the operation of a wireless network can be threatened by the leakage of transmission attributes at the physical (PHY) layer. Examples of these attributes are payload size, frequency offset (FO), modulation scheme, and the transmission rate. These attributes can be exploited by an adversary to launch passive or active attacks. A passive attacker may learn about the interests, sexual orientation, political views, and patentable ideas of the user through analyzing these features, whereas an active attacker exploits captured attributes to launch selective packet jamming/dropping and disrupt wireless services. These call for novel privacy preserving techniques beyond encryption. In this dissertation, we study the vulnerability of current wireless systems to the leakage of transmission attributes at the PHY layer and propose several schemes to prevent it. First, we design and experimentally demonstrate with USRPs an energy-efficient and highly disruptive jamming attack on the FO estimation of an OFDM system. OFDM is the core multiplexing scheme in many modern wireless systems (e. g., LTE/ 5 G and 802. 11 a/n/ac) and is highly susceptible to FO. FO is the difference in the operating frequencies of two radio oscillators. This estimation is done by the receiver using the publicly-known frame preamble. We show that the leakage of FO value via the preamble can facilitate an optimally designed jamming signal without needing to know the channel between the transmitter and the legitimate receiver. Our results show that the jammer can guarantee a successful attack even when its power is slightly less than the transmitter's power. We then propose four mitigation approaches against the proposed FO attack. Next, we consider certain transmission attributes that are disclosed via unencrypted PHY/MAC headers. Example of these attributes are payload size, transmission rate, and MAC addresses. Beyond unencrypted headers, the adversary can estimate the frame size and transmission rate through identifying the payload's modulation scheme and measuring the transmission time. To prevent the leakage of these attributes, we propose Friendly CryptoJam scheme, which consists of three components: First, a modulation-aware encryption scheme to encrypt the headers. Second, an efficient modulation obfuscation techniques. Specifically, the proposed modulation obfuscation scheme embeds the modulation symbols of a frame's payload into the constellation of the highest-order modulation scheme supported by the system. Together with effective PHY/MAC header encryption at the modulation level, the proposed obfuscation scheme hides the transmission rate, payload size, and other attributes announced in the headers while avoiding any BER performance loss. Compared with prior art, Friendly CryptoJam enjoys less complexity and less susceptibility to FO estimation errors. The third component is a novel PHY-level identification method. To facilitate PHY/MAC header encryption when a MAC layer sender identifier cannot be used (e. g., due to MAC address encryption), we propose two preamble-based <b>sender</b> <b>identification</b> methods, one for OFDM and one for non-OFDM systems. A sender identifier is special message that can be embedded in the frame preamble. The extent of the applications of our embedding scheme goes beyond identifier embedding and include embedding part of the data frame, the sender's digital signature, or any meta-data that the sender provides. Our message embedding method can further be used to mitigate the FO estimation attack because the jammer can no longer optimize its jamming signal with respect to a fixed preamble signal. In addition, we considered friendly jamming technique in a multi-link/hop network to degrade the channels of the eavesdroppers and prevent successful decoding of the headers, while minimizing the required jamming power by optimally placing the friendly jamming devices...|$|E

As a novel feature, it allows sending of classical framing information via sequences of strong laser pulses that precede the quantum data. This allows synchronization, <b>sender</b> and receiver <b>identification,</b> and compensation of time-varying birefringence in the communication channel. In addition, this method also provides a platform to communicate implementation specific information such as encoding and protocol in view of future optical quantum networks. We demonstrate in a longterm (37 hour) proof-of-principle study that polarization information encoded in the classical control frames can indeed be used to stabilize unwanted qubit transformation in the quantum channel. All optical elements in our setup can be operated at Gbps rates, which is a first requirement for a future system delivering secret keys at Mbps. In order to remove another bottleneck towards a high rate system, we investigate forward error correction based on Low-Density Parity-Check Codes.

50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{information}} gathered through the money remitter and Vigo et al. investigations, the Treasury Department issued a Geographic Targeting Order (“GTO”). This GTO targeted all remittances from the greater New York area to Colombia in excess of $750. The GTO required the reporting of these remittances on a form similar to that of a currency transaction report to the IRS, which form required <b>sender</b> information and <b>identification.</b> Within two days of the issuance of the GTO, remittances from the greater New York area to Colombia fell almost 90%, confirming {{that the vast majority of}} the remittances consisted of drug proceeds. Five of the ten largest licensed remitters in the greater New York area either voluntarily closed down or were prosecuted and closed. The GTO displaced huge amounts of money out of the remitters and on to the streets, resulting in a huge increase in money seizures on the Eastern seaboard, including street seizures, port seizures and even Amtrak seizures. In total, during the period that the GTO was in existence, approximately one year, El Dorado Task Force and Klapper seized over $4 million attributable to the GTO. The final result of the GTO was the voluntary lowering of the identification requirement for money remitters sending money to Colombia to $1,000. In addition, the Treasury Department issued new nonbank financial service regulations to address problems identified during GTO. Klapper prosecuted and convicted fourteen money remitter owners and employees for violating the GTO. These prosecutions spanned 1997-1998.|$|R
30|$|However, {{researches}} in {{this area}} have focused on allocating the optimal energy and rate and reducing {{the complexity of the}} bit-loading calculation itself [8 – 13] with the assumption of the availability of the feedback channel information. On the other hand, little effort has been made to design efficient protocols for bit loading in wireless networks. Designing an efficient protocol is not a trivial problem, because not only is the feedback information quite voluminous but also the time-varying wireless channel requires frequent transmissions of such large amounts of information. The research in [12] targeted centralized networks; so it assumed the existence of a central node which knows all the channel conditions of all member nodes. Moreover, due to the slow fading channel model used in this research, it does not suffer from feedback overhead. In the method proposed in [14], only the strongest subcarriers are used with high-order constellation to meet the target total data rate. The receiver informs the <b>sender</b> of the <b>identification</b> numbers (IDs) of the subcarriers which will be used for the next data transmission. Even though the feedback overhead is reduced to two OFDM symbols, the method in [14] cannot fully utilize all of the subcarriers. In effect, some of the chosen subcarriers may not be strong enough to deal with the high-order constellation. In addition, a separate feedback channel is used in [14]. Thus, such voluminous and frequent feedback information does not deteriorate the performance of wireless networks. However, all the previous works do not propose the feedback method how the transmitter and receiver estimate and share the dynamic channel status. To the best of our knowledge, no work has been published about bit-loading in distributed wireless networks with practical feedback overhead.|$|R
