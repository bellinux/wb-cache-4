"Aerodynamic {{experimentation}} {{in those}} days was not sophisticated enough to understand the rideheight sensitivity of aero,” Lowe explains. “In the windtunnel now 2014 we run rideheight <b>sweeps,</b> steer <b>sweeps,</b> roll <b>sweeps,</b> and yaw <b>sweeps,</b> plus a load more.

40|$|The {{contribution}} from selective <b>sweeps</b> to variation in genetic diversity has proven notoriously difficult to assess, {{in part because}} polymorphism data only allows detection of <b>sweeps</b> {{in the most recent}} few hundred thousand years. Here, we show how linked selection in ancestral species can be quantified across evolutionary timescales by analyzing patterns of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) along the genomes of closely related species. We show that <b>sweeps</b> in the human-chimpanzee and human-orangutan ancestors can be identified as depletions of ILS in regions in excess of 100 kb in length. <b>Sweeps</b> predicted in each ancestral species, as well as recurrent <b>sweeps</b> predicted in both species, often overlap <b>sweeps</b> predicted in humans. This suggests that many genomic regions experience recurrent selective <b>sweeps.</b> By comparing the ILS patterns along the genomes of the closely related human-chimpanzee and human-orangutan ancestors, we are further able to quantify the impact of selective <b>sweeps</b> relative to that of background selection. Compared with the human-orangutan ancestor, the human-chimpanzee ancestor shows a strong excess of regions depleted of ILS as well as a stronger reduction in ILS around genes. We conclude that <b>sweeps</b> play a strong role in reducing diversity along the genome and that <b>sweeps</b> have reduced diversity in the human-chimpanzee ancestor much more than in the human-orangutan ancestor...|$|R

40|$|Otter trawls {{are very}} {{effective}} at capturing flatfish, {{but they can}} affect the seaf loor ecosystems where they are used. Alaska f latf ish trawlers have very long cables (called <b>sweeps)</b> between doors and net to herd fish {{into the path of}} the trawl. These <b>sweeps,</b> which ride on and can disturb the seaf loor, account for most of the area affected by these trawls and hence {{a large proportion of the}} potential for damage to seaf loor organisms. We examined modifications to otter trawls, such that disk clusters were installed at 9 -m intervals to raise trawl <b>sweeps</b> small distances above the seafloor, greatly reducing the area of direct seafloor contact. A critical consideration was whether flatfish would still be herded effectively by these <b>sweeps.</b> We compared conventional and modified <b>sweeps</b> using a twin trawl system and analyzed the volume and composition of the resulting catches. We tested <b>sweeps</b> raised 5, 7. 5, and 10 cm and observed no significant losses of flatfish catch until <b>sweeps</b> were raised 10 cm, and those losses were relatively small (5 – 10...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates whether lifting the trawl doors and <b>sweeps</b> from the seabed can reduce bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries. We {{carried out a}} catch {{comparison}} and catch ratio analysis between two gear setups, one with the trawl doors and <b>sweeps</b> at the seabed (the traditional way) {{and the other with}} the doors and <b>sweeps</b> lifted. The study was carried out on American plaice. The results showed that when fishing with the doors and <b>sweeps</b> at the seabed, the gear is significantly more efficient at catching flatfish. The gear setup with the doors and <b>sweeps</b> at the seabed captures between 50 % and 70 % more American plaice than the gear setup with the doors and <b>sweeps</b> lifted. This difference is significant for sizes between 10 and 36 cm. Further, this efficiency is size dependent and increases with fish size. The results obtained are encouraging for the shrimp fishing industry as lifting the doors and <b>sweeps</b> from the seabed could help mitigate fish bycatch problems, and reduce bottom impact. Further studies are recommended to investigate if lifting the doors and <b>sweeps</b> from the seabed is equally efficient at reducing bycatch of other species, and if it also affects the shrimp catches...|$|R

The typical routine of gunnery drills and squadron exercises occurred in January 1916. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to <b>sweep</b> the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea.
