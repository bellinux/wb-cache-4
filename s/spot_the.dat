5|$|The J79 engines {{produced}} noticeable {{amounts of}} black smoke (at mid-throttle/cruise settings), a severe disadvantage in that the enemy could <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. This was solved on the F-4S fitted with the −10A engine variant which used a smokeless combustor.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Owen's class goes ice-skating on a river. Cornered by the bullies, Owen hits Kenny {{with a metal}} pole, {{splitting}} {{his left}} ear. At the same moment, the students <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> neighbor's body encased in the ice.|$|E
5|$|Lion {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and firing {{of the guns}} {{under the command of}} the director positioned on the foremast. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers controlled by the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier to <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells as each turret fired individually.|$|E
50|$|H. guttatopustulata is 7-9 mm in length, {{with the}} {{distinct}} rounded elytra or fore wings typical of ladybirds. Apart from their coloured <b>spots,</b> <b>the</b> elytra and pronotum are black, while the propleura, {{the sides of}} the prothorax, are yellow or yellowish brown. Each elytron bears three <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> <b>spot</b> on <b>the</b> top of the midline is reddish brown, as is <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> on <b>the</b> rear of <b>the</b> elytron. Another <b>spot</b> on <b>the</b> lower front part of the elytron also is yellow or yellowish brown.|$|R

50|$|The common small flat has a {{wingspan}} {{or around}} 30-35 mm. It is a dull black or brown butterfly with a semi-transparent <b>spot</b> on <b>the</b> wings and sometimes with no visible <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> {{underside of the}} wings is grey brown with diffused dark <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> male and female are similar in shape and colour and with hardly any differentiation. Both sexes of the flat are similar in appearance, being dull brownish black above and greyer in colour below. The butterflies have small, semi-transparent discal, cell and apical <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> dark <b>spots</b> on <b>the</b> underside of the forewing are large, dark and diffused.|$|R
5|$|Marseille {{attacked}} {{under conditions}} many considered unfavourable, but his marksmanship {{allowed him to}} make an approach fast enough to escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target. Marseille's excellent eyesight {{made it possible for}} him to <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> opponent before he was spotted, allowing him to take the appropriate action and manoeuvre into position for an attack.|$|E
5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis {{makes it easy to}} <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> navigator by being the one with red eyes from sleep deprivation.|$|E
5|$|Princess Royal {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire-control under the gunnery officer who now fired the guns. To align their {{guns on the}} target, the turret crewmen had to follow pointers whose position was transmitted from the director. This greatly increased accuracy as {{it was easier for}} the director to <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> fall of shells and eliminated the shell spread caused by the ship's roll as the turrets fired individually.|$|E
50|$|Danaus dorippus is a {{medium-sized}} butterfly with a wingspan of about 60 - 80 mm. The body is black {{with a few}} white <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> wings are tawny and have a thin border of black enclosing a series of semicircular white <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> hindwing has three or four black <b>spots</b> around <b>the</b> center.|$|R
50|$|The body of this goniodorid nudibranch is {{translucent}} {{white with}} red patches composed of small red dots partly coalesced into irregular shaped <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> rhinophores and gills are white {{with a few}} smaller red <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> oral tentacles, lateral papillae, gills, and tail have red <b>spots</b> at <b>the</b> base and yellow tips.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 42 mm. The forewings are yellow, {{with a pink}} costal area to beyond the middle. There is a subbasal pink <b>spot</b> below <b>the</b> cell and an antemedial <b>spot</b> in <b>the</b> cell and another further from the base below the cell, {{as well as a}} round <b>spot</b> in <b>the</b> cell towards the extremity and two small discoidal <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> inner margin is pink from the middle to the toruus and there is a postmedial series of pink spots, as well as a subterminal series of small <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> hindwings are pale yellow.|$|R
5|$|She {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire control under the director officer who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy since the ship's roll no longer dispersed the shells as each turret fired on its own; also, the fire-control director could more easily <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> fall of the shells.|$|E
5|$|The 21st did {{not reach}} the stone wall on Marye's Heights but took shelter in a very slight {{depression}} in the terrain, remaining pinned in that position until night. Under the cover of darkness, the regiment retired, only to be ordered to the same <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> next morning, expecting a Confederate counterattack which never came. The regiment lost {{a third of its}} numbers at Frederickburg.|$|E
5|$|The concert {{took place}} on Saturday, September 19, 1981, on the Great Lawn, the central open space of Central Park. The first spectators, many {{carrying}} chairs or picnic blankets, arrived at daybreak to secure a good <b>spot.</b> <b>The</b> Parks Department originally expected about 300,000 attendees. Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until {{the start of the}} concert, an estimated 500,000 audience members made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.|$|E

5|$|The dzong was consecrated in {{the name}} of Pungthang Dechen Phodrang. In 1639, a {{commemorative}} chapel was erected to house the arms seized from the Tibetans who were defeated by the Bhutanese on this <b>spot.</b> <b>The</b> Zhabdrung also set up a monastic order with 600 monks (brought from Cheri Gompa of upper Thimphu valley) and he lived here till his death.|$|E
5|$|The event grossed over $423,500 in {{ticket sales}} from an {{attendance}} of 8,200. Canadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section rated the WWE Tag Team Championship match a {{nine out of}} ten stars, the highest match rating. The event was released on DVD on January 16, 2007 by Sony Music Entertainment. The DVD reached second on Billboard's DVD Sales Chart for recreational sports during the week of February 18, 2007, and it dropped to the tenth <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> following week.|$|E
5|$|The king {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of the Champavati Temple. Now, the temple is under the Archaeological Survey of India, for its historical and archaeological importance. The major attraction of the temple is its Shikhara style architecture. Stone carved walls, full with sculptures, make the temple an attractive tourist <b>spot.</b> <b>The</b> temple has a large wheel on the rooftop, which adores it and makes it a distinguished temple in North India. The Champavati Temple is often compared with Laxmi Narayan Temple, in its grandeur.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>spot</b> of <b>the</b> {{conversion}} {{has also}} changed through the years. In 1924, NCAA rules <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> conversion at the 3-yard line, before moving {{it back to}} the 5-yard line in 1925. In 1929, <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> was moved up to the 2-yard line, which the NFL had done until [...] In 1968, the NCAA diverged from the NFL rules in moving <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> back to <b>the</b> original 3-yard line. Canadian rules originally <b>spotted</b> <b>the</b> conversion at the 5-yard line, which remains closer than in the American code as the goalposts are {{at the front of the}} end zone. In , to make conversion kicks harder, the NFL and CFL moved <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> of <b>the</b> kick to the 15 and 25-yard lines, respectively. In addition, the CFL moved <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> for a two-point conversion up to the 3-yard line to entice more teams to go for 2 points as opposed to one.|$|R

5|$|The loss of Taihō and Shōkaku left Zuikaku {{to recover}} the Division's few {{remaining}} aircraft after their heavy losses (only 102 aircraft remained aboard the seven surviving carriers by the evening) and the 1st Mobile Fleet continued its withdrawal towards Okinawa. The Americans did not <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> Japanese carriers until {{the afternoon of the}} following day and launched a large airstrike that only succeeded in hitting Zuikaku with a single bomb that started a fire in the hangar.|$|E
5|$|After {{the attackers}} crossed the Norwegian {{coastline}} at 3:40pm, two Beaufighters from No.144 and No.489 Squadrons detached {{themselves from the}} main force and pressed ahead as outriders. The two 'outriders' crossed Førde Fjord near where the German ships had been sighted that morning. At 3:50pm they sent Milson a radio message stating {{that they could not}} see the ships. The 'outriders' then turned to the east and overflew the town of Førde before searching the next fjord to the north; during their flight near Førde Fjord they did not <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> German warships in their new position. Meanwhile, the Ninth and Twelfth Squadrons of JG5 were scrambled from Herdla at 3:50pm and ordered to attack the Dallachy Wing and its escorts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{other teams}} {{including}} the Kansas City Royals, Baltimore Orioles, and New York Yankees had vied for a Wild Card <b>spot,</b> <b>the</b> Indians, Rangers, and Rays all remained in contention {{until the end}} of the season. Entering the final day of the scheduled regular season, on which all three teams played, the Indians had a 91–70 record while both the Rangers and Rays had 90–71 records. These were the best non-division-leading records in the American League. Thus, the possibility existed (had the Indians lost and the Rays and Rangers won) for a three-way tie for the two Wild Card spots, which would have required several tie-breaker games to settle. However, all three teams won, leaving the Indians definitively in the Wild Card Game at 92–70 and the Rays and Rangers tied at 91–71 for the second spot.|$|E
50|$|Adults are dark, purple-brown, {{with a white}} costal <b>spot</b> before <b>the</b> apex, and an {{opposite}} dorsal one on the forewings. Before these <b>spots,</b> <b>the</b> wing is flecked with a few minute white <b>spots,</b> <b>the</b> two largest of which are on the fold, and there is another {{at the end of}} the cell. <b>The</b> costal white <b>spot</b> shows through <b>the</b> wing. The hindwings are fuscous. Adults have been recorded on wing from April to September.|$|R
50|$|This goby is reddish-green on its dorsal {{surface with}} a number of small black <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> head has short black lines. Both the body and the head have {{numerous}} tiny, iridescent, pale blue, violet, and yellow dots. On the middle of the sides of the body is a row of six longitudinal dark <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> fins are yellowish-orange in color. The first dorsal fin has a slanting violet stripe, while the second dorsal fin is studded with small dark <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> pectoral fin is also covered with small <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> base of the anal fin and the rear portion of the ventral fins are black. The caudal fin has a stripe running through the center. Males have more intense blue markings than females. Juveniles have more black spots and less yellow and blue <b>spots</b> than <b>the</b> adults.|$|R

5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> value of the shift {{by looking at the}} displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E

5|$|By the All-Star {{break in}} February 2011, the Rockets were 26-31. On February 24, 2011, the Rockets traded Shane Battier to the Memphis Grizzlies for Hasheem Thabeet and a first round pick. They also traded Aaron Brooks to the Phoenix Suns for Goran Dragić and a first round pick. Afterwards the team won 15 games out of 20, {{reaching}} {{a winning record}} and contending for a playoff <b>spot.</b> <b>The</b> team entered April with chances of qualifying for the postseason, but {{for the second straight}} season the Rockets failed to make the playoffs after losing to the New Orleans Hornets in Louisiana with three games remaining.
