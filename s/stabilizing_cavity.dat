The proposed intermediate structures are consistent with mechanistic synthesis proposals, especially that of the Leuven group. Based on Molecular Dynamics simulations of key elementary reaction steps we analyze the interaction between the structure directing agents (SDAs) and the silicate precursor species in MFI and MEL synthesis. A key result is the necessity of the alkyl chains of the alkylammonium ion templates to <b>stabilize</b> <b>cavities</b> in intermediate silicate oligomers as well as their role to assist the aggregation of such silicate clusters to form channel intersections.

The FS-CRDS allowed the collection of high-resolution (< 1 MHz) spectra {{in conjunction with the}} exception sensitivity of the CRDS technique. Line positions were measured with an accuracy better than 2 x 10 - 5 cm - 1 by calibrating our spectra against the hyperfine components of 39 K D lines.

Line intensities obtained using the Galatry profile are compared with previously measured values and found to be approximately 1 % smaller than intensities found in current databases. Many of the other lineshape parameters are in good agreement with previous measurements. However, the pressure-induced shifts of the current work are considered much more accurate than other studies.

40|$|Pulse {{generation}} {{often requires}} a <b>stabilized</b> <b>cavity</b> and its corresponding mode structure for initial phase-locking. Contrastingly, modeless cavity-free random lasers provide new possibilities for high quantum efficiency lasing {{that could potentially}} be widely tunable spectrally and temporally. Pulse generation in random lasers, however, has remained elusive since the discovery of modeless gain lasing. Here we report coherent pulse generation with modeless random lasers based on the unique polarization selectivity and broadband saturable absorption of monolayer graphene. Simultaneous temporal compression of cavity-free pulses are observed with such a polarization modulation, along with a broadly-tunable pulsewidth across two orders of magnitude down to 900 ps, a broadly-tunable repetition rate across three orders of magnitude up to 3 MHz, and a singly-polarized pulse train at 41 dB extinction ratio, about {{an order of magnitude}} larger than conventional pulsed fiber lasers. Moreover, our graphene-based pulse formation also demonstrates robust pulse-to-pulse stability and wide-wavelength operation due to the cavity-less feature. Such a graphene-based architecture not only provides a tunable pulsed random laser for fiber-optic sensing, speckle-free imaging, and laser-material processing, but also a new way for the non-random CW fiber lasers to generate widely tunable and singly-polarized pulses.

40|$|The {{coupling}} {{of mechanical}} oscillators with light {{has seen a}} recent surge of interest, as recent reviews report. [1, 2] This coupling is enhanced when confining light in an optical cavity where the mechanical oscillator is integrated as back- mirror or movable wall. At the nano-scale, the optomechanical coupling increases further thanks to a smaller optomechanical interaction volume and reduced mass of the mechanical oscillator. In view of realizing such cavity nano- optomechanics experiments, a scheme was proposed where a sub-wavelength sized nanomechanical oscillator is coupled to a high finesse optical microcavity. [3] Here we present such an experiment involving a single nanomechanical rod precisely positioned into the confined mode of a miniature Fabry-Pérot cavity. [4] We describe the employed <b>stabilized</b> <b>cavity</b> set-up and related finesse measurements. We proceed characterizing the nanorod vibration properties using ultrasonic piezo-actuation methods. Using the optical cavity as a transducer of nanomechanical motion, we monitor optically the piezo-driven nanorod vibration. On top of extending cavity quantum electrodynamics concepts to nanomechanical systems, cavity nano-optomechanics should advance into precision displacement measurements near the standard quantum limit [5], investigation of mechanical systems in their quantum regime, non-linear dynamics [6] and sensing applications.

40|$|Experiments {{involving}} micro- and nanomechanical resonators need to {{be carefully}} designed to reduce mechanical environmental noise. A small scale on-chip approach is to add an additional resonator to {{the system as a}} mechanical low-pass filter. Unfortunately, the inherent low frequency of the low-pass filter causes the system to be easily excited mechanically. Fixating the additional resonator ensures that the resonator itself can not be excited by the environment. This, however, negates the purpose of the low-pass filter. We solve this apparent paradox by applying active feedback to the resonator, thereby minimizing the motion with respect the front mirror of an optomechanical cavity. Not only does this method actively <b>stabilize</b> the <b>cavity</b> length, but it also retains the on-chip vibration isolation. Comment: Minor adjustments mad...|$|R

40|$|The unexplained {{nature of}} dark matter and dark energy is a {{prominent}} reason for investigating physicsbeyond the standard model of particle physics (SM). Some extensions of the SM propose weaklyinteracting slim particles (WISPs). In an attempt to prove {{the existence of these}} particles, Light shiningthrough the wall (LSW) experiments explore a very weak coupling between WISPs and photons (and viceversa). LSW experiments employ high-power lasers that provide a well defined flux of photons for theWISP-Photon conversion. The ALPS-I experiment at DESY in Hamburg was the first successfulexperiment with a high finesse optical resonator to enhance the laser power in a strong magnetic field inorder to increase the photon to WISP conversion probability. The ALPS-II experimental concept adds asecond optical cavity to also increase the reconversion probability. Both cavities are separated by a wall,amplify light at 1064 nm and share a common optical axis. Operating these two cavities inside 20 straightened HERA superconducting dipole magnets and using a transition edge sensor (TES) as a singlephoton detector will make the ALPS-II experiment almost three orders of magnitude more sensitive thanits predecessor. Since photons, originating from reconverted WISPs in the regeneration cavity (RC) have 1064 nm wavelengths, the RC has to be locked to the production cavity (PC) with light of a differentwavelength. Therefore frequency doubled PCs light will be used to lock the RC. This 532 nm light shallnot arrive at the TES to prevent background noise. To achieve this, an optical attenuation system forwavelengths different from 1064 nm is required. In my thesis, the required attenuation was estimated andan optical setup was proposed and constructed and tested. It attenuates green photons by a factor of of 10 ^− 18 and transmits 85 % of the infrared photons. Furthermore the high finesse production cavity ofALPS-IIa was set up and characterized during this thesis. The PC reached a finesse of F =~ 1600, whichis approximately a factor of five lower than the design value due to additional unknown losses. Nevertheless it was robustly locked for more than two hours. The <b>stabilized</b> <b>cavity</b> was used to gainimportant knowledge about the limiting factors and the environmental conditions in the new laboratoriesregarding vibrational noises.

40|$|Analysis of an {{application}} of the rudy maser to a superconducting <b>Cavity</b> <b>Stabilized</b> oscillator shows many attractive features. These derive from the mechancial stability inherent in an all-cryogenic design and from {{the properties of the}} ruby maser itself. A multiple-cavity design has been developed to allow physical separation of the high-Q superconducting cavity and the ruby element with its requried applied magnetic field. Mode selection is accomplished in this design by tuning the ruby by means of the applied field. We conclude that such an oscillator would perform well, even with cavity Q's as low as 10 to the 8 th power allowing the use of a superconductor-on-sapphire resonator with its greater rigidity and lower thermal expansion. A first test of the Superconducting <b>Cavity</b> <b>Stabilized</b> Maser Oscillator (SCSMO) confirms the efficacy of the multiple-cavity design and the applicability of the ruby maser. Frequency variation less than 4 x 10 to the minus 11 th power was measured in the stabilized mode and is attributed to the reference oscillator and to instabilities in the pump source. Variation of 10 to the minus 10 th power was observed in the low-Q unstabilized mode, again attributable to pump fluctuations. Even so, direct scaling to a Q of 10 the 9 th power predicts a stability better than 10 to the minus 15 th power.
