2500|$|Epithelial {{cells in}} SS lesions are active {{participants}} in the induction and perpetuation of the inflammatory process. Environmental and hormonal factors, in concert with an appropriate genetic background, are believed to trigger SS, which dysregulates epithelial cells and allows aberrant homing and activation of dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, and B cells. Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells [...] which process antigen material and present it to other T cells. Following the migration of lymphocytes into the glands in response to chemokines and <b>specific</b> <b>adhesion</b> molecules, T cells interact with epithelial cells. Epithelial cells are further activated by proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF), which are produced by adjacent T cells. The early accumulation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the target tissues, which produce high levels of type 1 IFNs, seems to be important, as these cells can further dysregulate the immune response through abnormal retention of lymphocytes in the tissues and their subsequent activation. IFN-α stimulates the production of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) by epithelial cells, DCs, and T cells. BAFF stimulates aberrant B-cell maturation, leading {{to the emergence of}} self-reactive B cells, which locally produce autoantibodies, in a germinal centre-like structure (GC-like), which is also the location of lymphomagenesis (origin of lymphoma).|$|E

Cadherins mediate neuronal interactions in an extensive way and are also associated with selective axon-axon fasciculation. Cadherin domains take part in homophilic cell-cell adhesion. Classical cadherins are characterized by a conserved catenin-binding side in their intracellular tail that provides a dynamic link to the cytoskeleton.|$|E
50|$|In active intravasation, {{cancerous}} cells actively migrate toward {{and then}} into nearby blood vessels. The first step in this process is <b>specific</b> <b>adhesion</b> to venular endothelial cells, followed by adherence to proteins of the subendothelial basement membrane, such as laminin and types IV and V collagen.

Numerous {{studies have shown that}} inhibiting a single adhesin in this coordinated effort can often be enough to make a pathogenic bacterium non-virulent. This has led to the exploration of adhesin activity interruption as a method of bacterial infection treatment.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBasement {{membrane}} (BM), a sheet-like form of extracellular matrix, surrounds most tissues. During organogenesis, <b>specific</b> <b>adhesions</b> between adjoining tissues frequently occur; however, their {{molecular basis}} is unclear. Using live-cell imaging and electron microscopy, we identify an adhesion system {{that connects the}} uterine and gonadal tissues through their juxtaposed BMs {{at the site of}} anchor cell (AC) invasion in C.  elegans. We find that the extracellular matrix component hemicentin (HIM- 4), found between BMs, forms punctate accumulations under the AC and controls BM linkage to promote rapid invasion. Through targeted screening, we identify the integrin-binding cytolinker plakin (VAB- 10 A) and integrin (INA- 1 /PAT- 3) as key BM-BM linkage regulators: VAB- 10 A localizes to the AC-BM interface and tethers hemicentin to the AC while integrin promotes hemicentin punctae formation. Together, plakin, integrin, and hemicentin are founding components of a cell-directed adhesion system, which we name a BM-LINKage (B-LINK), that connects adjacent tissues through adjoining BMs...|$|R

In contrast to the endothelial cells from other vessels, the high endothelial cells of HEVs have a distinctive appearance, consisting of a cuboidal morphology and with various receptors to interact with leukocytes (express specialized ligands for lymphocytes {{and are able to}} support high levels of lymphocyte extravasation). HEVs enable naïve lymphocytes to move {{in and out of the}} lymph nodes from the circulatory system.

Currently, the receptor:ligand theory is widely adopted as the governing mechanism of specific cell adhesion.

In this layer specific interactions between carbohydrate ligands and protein receptors are formed to control cell–cell recognition, cell adhesion and related processes. The aim of this work is {{to shed light on}} the principles of complex formation between surface anchored carbohydrates and receptor surfaces by measuring the <b>specific</b> <b>adhesion</b> between surface bound mannose on a concanavalin A (ConA) layer via poly(ethylene glycol) -(PEG) -based soft colloidal probes (SCPs). Special emphasis is on the dependence of multivalent presentation and density of carbohydrate units on <b>specific</b> <b>adhesion.</b> Consequently, we first present a synthetic strategy that allows for controlled density variation of functional groups on the PEG scaffold using unsaturated carboxylic acids (crotonic acid, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid) as grafting units for mannose conjugation. We showed by a range of analytic techniques (ATR–FTIR, Raman microscopy, zeta potential and titration) that this synthetic strategy allows for straightforward variation in grafting density and grafting length enabling the controlled presentation of mannose units on the PEG network. Finally we determined the <b>specific</b> <b>adhesion</b> of PEG-network-conjugated mannose units on ConA surfaces as a function of density and grafting type. Remarkably, the results indicated the absence of a molecular-level enhancement of mannose/ConA interaction due to chelate- or subsite-binding.

Here, a system is proposed that enables mechanical stimulation of human-skin-derived keratinocytes and human dermal fibroblasts that specifically interact with peptide sequences immobilized on a non-interacting but deformable substrate. The peptide sequences mimic fibronectin, laminin, and collagen type IV, three major components of the ECM.
