5000|$|A {{messaging}} {{system in which}} clients <b>address</b> <b>messages</b> to a specific node in a content hierarchy, called a topic. Publishers and subscribers are generally anonymous and can dynamically publish or subscribe to the content hierarchy. The system takes care of distributing the messages arriving from a node's multiple publishers to its multiple subscribers. Messages are generally not persistent and will only be received by subscribers who are listening {{at the time the}} message is sent. A special case known as a “durable subscription” allows subscribers to receive messages sent while the subscribers are not active. (Source: http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/glossary.html) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{network layer}} routes {{messages}} through the interconnect. Nodes {{in the network}} are identified {{by means of a}} 16-bit <b>address.</b> <b>Messages</b> are routed by successively matching bits of the destination address. On every node the message is brought closer to the destination by taking the first non matching bit, and looking up a set of links to be used for that destination. The message is then routed over that link, and the route is [...] "rolled up" [...] when the END or PAUSE control token is found.

If a slave has all the address bits so far, it returns a 0. The master uses this simple behavior to search systematically for valid sequences of address bits. The process is much faster than a brute force search of all possible 64-bit numbers because as soon as an invalid bit is detected, all <b>subsequent</b> <b>address</b> bits {{are known to be}} invalid.
