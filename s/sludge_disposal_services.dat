40|$|Abstract: Solutions for <b>sludge</b> {{treatment}} and <b>disposal</b> produced at {{waste water treatment}} plants have to be reliable {{at any time and}} therefore need a legally, organisationally and technically sound background. The legal background normally is created at a national or even supranational (EU) level. The technical and organisational solutions can be manifold depending on the specific local situation at a treatment plant. This paper deals with the development of indicators for <b>sludge</b> {{treatment and}} <b>disposal</b> which enable the decision makers at a national level to assess <b>sludge</b> <b>disposal</b> options in regard to economic and ecologic relevance. Special emphasis is given to the use of sludge in agriculture as it follows the ideas of recycling of valuable nutrients from waste water to agriculture. This investigation shows the different relevance of <b>sludge</b> <b>disposal</b> for the treatment plant operators and for agriculture in terms of economy and reliability. For the treatment plants <b>sludge</b> <b>disposal</b> represents a very important cost factor much less for the “consumers ” of waste water services. For agriculture sludge is of low economic relevance while for a farmer using sludge as P-fertiliser it can be high. The most relevant ecologic aspect of <b>sludge</b> <b>disposal</b> is with the P-content of sludge which has a high relevance in regional material cycle while it is low for Nitrogen, the value of organic matter in the sludge has only local/regional relevance. The method developed can be applied for other countries. The results for Austria (EU member state) are calculated and discussed in detail...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{mainly focused}} on the {{occurrence}} of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in sewage dewatered sludge and their discharges through <b>sludge</b> <b>disposal</b> from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The data were obtained and calculated from seven PPCPs in dewatered sludge collected from 12 WWTPs in two typical cities, Beijing and Shenzhen in China. Four of seven PPCPs, diclofenac acid, carbamazepine, mefenamic acid and N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide were detectable in dewatered sludge from Beijing and Shenzhen with concentration up to 4240, 11, 060, 92 and 219  μg/kg respectively. While, the other three compounds, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol and bezafibrate were not detected in collected samples from these two cities. The highest discharge of diclofenac acid and carbamazepine were 1023  g/d and 494  g/d respectively. In addition, the total discharge of these four detected PPCPs from each plant ranged from 5 to 1092  g/d in Beijing and 4 – 497  g/d in Shenzhen.

40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{forthcoming}} European Union ban on sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>disposal</b> at sea and associated environmental legislation which {{has increased the}} amount of sewage sludge produced annually in the UK, {{there is a need}} for consolidation and expansion of existing <b>sludge</b> <b>disposal</b> outlets and assessment of the suitability of alternative and innovative disposal options. This paper eviews the main elements of <b>sludge</b> <b>disposal</b> in the UK in relation to their environmental sensitivity, sustainability and general security. Much of the additional s udge produced by changes in waste water treatment is likely to be accommodated by an increase in disposal by incineration and application toagricultural land. The ffect of sludge application to land has, therefore, come under increasing examination, primarily due to potentially detrimental long-term effects on soil fertility and on nitrate leaching to groundwater. The implications and causes of nitrate leaching are discussed in relationship to sludge types and recommendations made for minimizing potentially adverse impacts to sensitive groundwater. Concern over the environmental impact of sewage sludge, together with other environ-mental issues, has given rise to a variety of recent legislation; for example, EC Directive...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of urbanization in china, municipal wastewater treatment develops rapidly.

Located near Area 3 on the TTR approximately 140 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, CAU 409 is comprised of three Corrective Action Sites (CASs) : CAS RG- 24 - 001 -RGCR, Battery Dump Site; CAS TA- 53 - 001 -TAB 2, Septic <b>Sludge</b> <b>Disposal</b> Pit (referred to as Septic <b>Sludge</b> <b>Disposal</b> Pit No. 1); CAS TA- 53 - 002 -TAB 2, Septic <b>Sludge</b> <b>Disposal</b> Pit (referred to as Septic <b>Sludge</b> <b>Disposal</b> Pit No. 2). This CADD/CR identifies and rationalizes the U. S.

The CADD/CR have been combined into one report based on sample data collected during the field investigation performed in November 2000. Analysis of the data generated from these investigation activities indicates preliminary action levels were not exceeded for total volatile organic compounds, Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) volatile organic compounds, total semivolatile organic compounds, TCLP semivolatile organic compounds, total Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) metals (except arsenic), TCLP RCRA metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline- and diesel-range organics, isotopic uranium, and gamma-emitting radionuclides (except thorium- 234) for any of the soil samples collected. Concentrations of arsenic were detected above the preliminary action level in all samples; however, the concentrations are considered representative of ambient conditions at the site. Thorium- 234 was tentatively identified in one sample; however, the concentration is considered no greater than background. The NNSA/NV's final determination is that CAU 409 shows no evidence of soil contamination at any of the associated CASs; therefore, the recommendation for no corrective action is justified...|$|R

40|$|Land {{application}} {{of sewage sludge}} in China is thoroughly reviewed. Operation of sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>disposal</b> is usually expensive and/or easy to contaminate the environment. In China, most sewage sludge has not been treated and disposed of properly, resulting in environmental pollution and potential exposure to humans. In the near future, sewage sludge production in China will increase rapidly together with the dramatic increase of municipal wastewater treatment ratio (treated/produced), implying {{that the problem of}} sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>disposal</b> will become more serious and unavoidable. Proper land utilization of stabilized sewage sludge can make a positive contribution to agriculture, forestry, horticulture and city development.

Corrective Action Unit 409 consists of three Corrective Action Sites (CASs) : TA- 53 - 001 -TAB 2, Septic <b>Sludge</b> <b>Disposal</b> Pit No. 1; TA- 53 - 002 -TAB 2, Septic <b>Sludge</b> <b>Disposal</b> Pit No. 2; and RG- 24 - 001 -RGCR, Battery Dump Site. The Septic <b>Sludge</b> <b>Disposal</b> Pits are located near Bunker Two, close to Area 3, on the Tonopah Test Range. The Battery Dump Site {{is located at the}} abandoned Cactus Repeater Station on Cactus Peak. The Cactus Repeater Station was a remote, battery-powered, signal repeater station. The two Septic <b>Sludge</b> <b>Disposal</b> Pits were suspected to be used through the late 1980 s as <b>disposal</b> sites for <b>sludge</b> from septic tanks located in Area 3. Based on site history collected to support the Data Quality Objectives process, contaminants of potential concern are the same for the disposal pits and include: volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semivolatile organic compounds, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) as gasoline- and diesel-range organics, polychlorinated biphenyls, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, and radionuclides (including plutonium and depleted uranium). The Battery Dump Site consists of discarded lead-acid batteries and associated construction debris, placing the site in a Housekeeping Category and, consequently, no contaminants are expected to be encountered during the cleanup process. The corrective action the at this CAU will include collection of discarded batteries and construction debris at the Battery Dump Site for proper disposal and recycling, along with photographic documentation as the process progresses. The corrective action for the remaining CASs involves the collection of background radiological data through borings drilled at undisturbed locations near the area of the disposal pits; field screening samples for radiological constituents; analysis for geotechnical/hydrologic parameters of samples beneath the disposal pits; and bioassessment samples, if VOC or TPH contamination concentrations exceed field-screening levels. The results of this field investigation will support a defensible evaluation of corrective action alternatives in the corrective action decision document...|$|R
