5|$|Roskilde Museum is a {{local history}} museum, run by the {{municipalities}} of Roskilde, Frederikssund and Lejre. The main branch in Roskilde, {{on the corner of}} Sankt Olsgade and Sankt Olsstræde, is based in two listed buildings, Sukkerhuset (the <b>Sugar</b> <b>House)</b> and Liebes Gård (Liebe House), a former sugar refinery and merchant's house. The <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> was built by a consortium led by Johan Jørgen Holst as a facility for the processing of raw sugar from the Danish West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Jacob Borch {{constructed}} Liebe House in 1804 on {{the site}} next to the sugar factory. It replaced a modest house with timber framing and a straw roof dating from the 17th century. The building {{takes its name from}} the Liebe family who owned the property for two generations later in the century. On the occasion of his death in 1900, Liebe left the entire building complex to Roskilde Municipality. In 1908, the <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> came into use as a fire station. Roskilde Local History Museum was founded on 12 November 1929 {{on the ground floor of}} the Liebe House. When the fire station moved to new premises in 1989, Roskilde Museum took over the <b>Sugar</b> <b>House.</b> The museum has exhibits from prehistory, through the Viking Era and the Middle Ages to modern times. The Museum of Tools, housed in separate premises, contains a collection of tools used by craftsmen such as wheelrights, carpenters, shoemakers and wood carvers from around 1850 to 1950.|$|E
5|$|The freeway {{enters the}} Salt Lake Valley {{on the former}} {{alignment}} of North Temple Street until it passes the Salt Lake City International Airport, where the freeway veers slightly south and leaves the North Temple Street corridor which leads to Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City. The Green Line of the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) TRAX system briefly parallels I-80 before traveling {{down the center of}} North Temple Street. I-80 becomes concurrent with I-15 after interchanges with SR-58 and 600South and continues south for about , passing along the western and southern edges of downtown Salt Lake City. The southern interchange with I-15, which also includes SR-201 (21st South Freeway) and marks the end of the concurrency, is known as the Spaghetti Bowl,. In the southwestern corner of the Spaghetti Bowl is another portion of the UTA TRAX Green Line as it travels towards West Valley City. After separating from I-15, the freeway continues easterly through South Salt Lake, loosely following an alignment just south of 2100South and the UTA S Line streetcar through the <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> neighborhood and past <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> Parkonce the home of the <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> Prison towards the clockwise terminus of the I-215 270° belt route around Salt Lake. It continues through Parley's Canyon, where the freeway joins the historical route of the Lincoln Highway. Between the mouth of the canyon and the Summit county line, the route re-enters the Wasatch National Forest.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sugar</b> <b>houses</b> in New York City {{were used}} as prisons by occupying British forces during the American Revolutionary War. Out of 2,600 prisoners of war {{captured}} during the Battle of Fort Washington in November 1776, 1,900 would die in the following months at makeshift prisons throughout the city. At least 17,500 are estimated to have perished under substandard conditions of such <b>sugar</b> <b>houses</b> and British prison ships {{over the course of}} the war, more than double that of casualties from battle.|$|R
50|$|The {{economic}} history of Edgard included a sawmill operated by Severin Tassin, a brick factory begun in 1878, and several sugar plantations that operated {{in the century}} between 1794 and 1894. By 1899, {{there were more than}} fifty family-owned <b>sugar</b> <b>houses</b> (<b>sugar</b> mills) still in existence.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{industry}} of Marsoui is forestry. The Bois Marsoui GDS mill supports 60% of its population. There {{is also a}} small tourism industry, including 2 commercial <b>sugar</b> <b>houses.</b> Other businesses provide local commercial and public services.|$|R

5|$|Nash {{himself was}} asked by the College to design a new {{building}} near fashionable Trafalgar Square but Nash's elaborate plan proved too costly and ambitious for the College. At the same time the College also asked Robert Abraham to submit to them a second plan for the building. When Nash heard that another architect was approached behind his back he reacted vehemently, and attacked the heralds. The College nevertheless continued with their plans. However they were constantly beset by conflicts between the different officers over the amount needed to build a new building. By 1827 the college still had no coherent plan; the Duke of Norfolk ordered the College to drop the matter altogether. By 1842 the heralds were reconciled with their location and once again commissioned Abraham to build a new octagonal-shaped Record Room {{on the site of the}} old <b>Sugar</b> <b>House.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Sugar</b> <b>House,</b> {{in southeastern}} Salt Lake City, has a {{reputation}} as an older neighborhood with lots of small shops in the center. <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> is an area which {{has been the focus of}} redevelopment efforts such as the UTA S-Line Streetcar. In late 2015 there were approximately 900 apartment units either recently built or under construction in the <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> area, with an additional 492 units proposed.|$|E

It combined several new office and residential buildings (one of which is the city's third-tallest building) around an outdoor shopping center featuring a stream, fountain, and other outdoor amenities; it opened on March 22, 2012. <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> is a neighborhood with a small town main street shopping area and numerous old parks, which will soon be served by the S Line (formerly known as <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> Streetcar). <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> Park is the second largest park in the city, and is host to frequent outdoor events and the primary Fourth of July fireworks in the city.|$|E
25|$|Between 64 and 125 enslaved men marched from sugar {{plantations}} near present-day LaPlace on the German Coast {{toward the}} city of New Orleans. They collected more men along the way. Some accounts claimed a total of 200 to 500 slaves participated. During their two-day, twenty-mile march, the men burned five plantation houses (three completely), several <b>sugar</b> <b>houses</b> (small <b>sugar</b> cane mills), and crops. They were armed mostly with hand tools.|$|R
50|$|In 1848, Houma was {{incorporated}} {{as a city}} {{by an act of}} legislature. By this time, industry in Houma consisted largely of plantations for sugar cane, the harvesting of seafood, fur trading, and logging industries. The cultivation of sugar cane was the principal agricultural industry in the parish. The first plantation in the parish was established in 1828. By 1851, Terrebonne had 110 plantations with 80 <b>sugar</b> <b>houses</b> (small <b>sugar</b> cane mills).|$|R
50|$|The VMSMA educates {{consumers}} {{by providing}} {{information on how}} maple syrup is made, its nutritional value, how to cook with it, and promotes visits to <b>sugar</b> <b>houses</b> where the public can watch maple syrup being made. As maple sugarmaking is intertwined with Vermont's culture and history the VMSMA works with its related organization, the non-profit Vermont Maple Foundation to provide demonstrations, arranges visits and events, and presents the story of Vermont maple sugarmaking.|$|R

25|$|The highway {{continues}} {{north on}} 700 East in Salt Lake City and intersects I-80 at exit 125, a diamond interchange. It crosses the S Line (formerly known as <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> Streetcar) right-of-way {{west of the}} Forest Dale neighborhood of <b>Sugar</b> <b>House,</b> and then intersects 2100 South (former US-40 and US-40A). Between 2100 South and Liberty Park, the road passes through mainly residential areas and includes bicycle lanes despite its formidable width and heavy traffic. SR-71 passes along {{the eastern edge of}} Liberty Park, which extends from 1300 South to 900 South. At 900 South the road narrows to approximately its original (generous) width laid out by Brigham Young and then passes Trolley Square (600 South to 500 South) before terminating at SR-186 (400 South), which has the UTA TRAX Red Line in its median, near the Gilgal Sculpture Garden. 700 East continues north as a wide (but not state-maintained) road as far as South Temple.|$|E
25|$|Navy Yard was Washington's {{earliest}} industrial neighborhood. One of {{the earliest}} industrial buildings was the eight-story brick <b>Sugar</b> <b>House,</b> built in Square 744 {{at the foot of}} New Jersey Avenue, SE as a sugar refinery in 1797-98. In 1805, it became the Washington Brewery, which produced beer until it closed in 1836. The brewery site was just west of the Washington City Canal in what is now Parking Lot H/I in the block between Nationals Park and the historic DC Water pumping station.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the town's folk worked in the <b>sugar</b> <b>houses,</b> in the fields, or {{in support of the}} sugar industry. Many families leased land from the Caires and Graugnards on Columbia Plantation, cultivating their own produce to sell. In 1899, the river was the scene of some excitement when in the late winter ice could be seen floating downstream. The ice flows jammed up the river, interrupting ship traffic for several days.|$|R

25|$|During {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, an {{extensive}} streetcar system was constructed throughout the city, {{with the first}} streetcar running in 1872 and electrification of the system in 1889. As {{in the rest of}} the country, the automobile usurped the streetcar, and the last trolley was approved for conversion in 1941, yet ran until 1945, due to WWII. Trolley buses ran until 1946. Light rail transit returned to the city when UTA's TRAX opened in 1999. The S Line (formerly known as <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> Streetcar) opened for service in December 2013 on an old D right-of-way.|$|E
25|$|The exact date of {{his release}} from the <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> Prison is not known. However, by October 1780, he was living near Crompond, New York where he was serving as pastor of the Presbyterian Church at that location. He served as the pastor of several Presbyterian churches in Westchester County, New York from 1780 to around 1788. In 1788 or 9 he was preaching in the North Parish of New Fairfield, Connecticut, now the town of Sherman, Connecticut; and in 1790 he was {{similarly}} engaged in Greenfield, then part of Saratoga, New York. Sometime in 1790, he had relocated to Duanesburg, New York where many {{members of his family}} had settled and he founded the Presbyterian Church in Duanesburg around this same time.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to larger centers like <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> and Downtown, Salt Lake City contains several smaller neighborhoods, each {{named after the}} closest major intersection. Two examples are the 9th and 9th (at the intersection of 900 East and 900 South Streets) and 15th & 15th (at the intersection of 1500 East and 1500 South Streets) neighborhoods. These areas are home to foot-traffic friendly, amenities-based businesses such as art galleries, clothing retail, salons, restaurants and coffee shops. During the summer of 2007, 9th and 9th saw sidewalk and street improvements {{as well as an}} art installation by Troy Pillow of Seattle, Washington inspired by the 9 Muses of Greek myth, thanks in part to a monetary grant from Salt Lake City.|$|E
50|$|The {{carriage}} {{house is a}} single-story timber frame structure which joins the house (via the ell) to the barn. Its construction date is uncertain, but it was built before 1890, and {{is probably the most}} recently built part of the connected complex. The barn is a massive structure with four levels, which was developed in stages between about 1818 and 1915. The <b>sugar</b> <b>house's</b> construction date is unknown, but is believed by the family to have been built between 1856 and 1890. The blacksmith shop, which stands a short way east of the main complex, is of great age, and appears to predate the Stearns family ownership.|$|R

25|$|In the 17th century, {{the site}} north from Wall Street was {{occupied}} by John Damen's farm; in 1685, Damen sold the land to captain John Knight, an officer of Thomas Dongan's administration. Knight resold the land to Dongan, and Dongan resold it in 1689 to Abraham de Peyster and Nicholas Bayard. Both de Peyster and Bayard served as Mayors of New York. The first known building on the site, a <b>sugar</b> <b>house,</b> was built by Samuel Bayard. In 1718, most of the present-day block was sold to a church congregation, while the corner lot, cut into narrow strips, remained in possession of the de Peysters and the Bayards. In 1773, de Peyster sold the corner lot to the Verplanck family for less than $1,500; the Verplanck mansion later housed Wall Street banks.|$|E
500|$|In 1742 a <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> {{was built}} {{against the wall}} of the College. This {{structure}} was a fire risk and the cause of great anxiety among the heralds. In 1775 the College Surveyor drew attention to this problem, but to no avail. In February 1800, the College was asked by a Select Committee of the House of Commons to report to them the state of public records; again the heralds drew attention to the proximity of the <b>Sugar</b> <b>House.</b> Members of the committee inspected the College premises and reported to the House that the College must either be moved to a new building or secured against the risk of fire. Again nothing was done; in 1812 water seeped through the walls of the College damaging records. The Surveyor traced the leak back to a shed recently erected by Mr. Alderman Smith, owner of the <b>Sugar</b> <b>House,</b> who declared his readiness to do everything he could, but who actually did very little to rectify the situation. After years of negotiation the College, in 1820, bought the <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> from Smith for the sum of £1,500.|$|E
500|$|Great {{financial}} strains {{placed upon}} the College during these times were relieved when the extravagant Prince Regent (the future George IV), {{granted to the}} College an annual endowment by Royal Warrant on 29 February 1820. This generous endowment from the crown, the first since 1555, was applied towards the reparation {{and support of the}} College. Despite the successes of the purchase of the <b>Sugar</b> <b>House</b> and the royal endowment, the College still looked upon the possibility of moving its location to a more suitable and fashionable place. John Nash was at the same time laying out his plans for a new London, and, in 1822, the College, through the Deputy Earl Marshal, asked the government for a portion of land in the new districts on which to build a house to keep their records. A petition from the College was given to the Lords of the Treasury setting out the herald's reason for the move: [...] "that the local situation of the College is so widely detached from the proper scene of the official duties and occupations of Your Memorialists and from the residences of that class of persons by whom the records in their charge are chiefly and most frequently consulted." ...|$|E
