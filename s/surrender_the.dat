50|$|Unfortunately for the French, {{the well}} rested and {{supplied}} Prussians split their forces into three groups, which they quickly used to flank and encircle the French, {{forcing them to}} fight the quite adverse Battle of Sedan. After staggering casualties, the force along with <b>the</b> king <b>surrendered</b> <b>the</b> following morning. Along with <b>the</b> <b>surrender</b> of <b>the</b> King, came <b>the</b> implicit <b>surrender</b> of <b>the</b> French government.

5|$|At Kruger's {{suggestion}} Joubert {{was elected}} Commandant-General of the restored republic, {{though he had}} little military experience and protested he was not suited to the position. The provisional government set up a temporary capital at Heidelberg, a strategically placed town {{on the main road}} from Natal, and sent a copy of the proclamation to Lanyon along with a written demand that he <b>surrender</b> <b>the</b> government offices in Pretoria. Lanyon refused and mobilised the British garrison.|$|E
5|$|British Governor Valentine Morris and {{military}} commander Lieutenant Colonel George Etherington disagreed {{on how to}} react and ended up surrendering without significant resistance.

The area remained under Carib control until the Second Carib War of 1795.|$|E
5|$|Béla {{adopted an}} active foreign policy {{soon after the}} {{withdrawal}} of the Mongols. In the second half of 1242 he invaded Austria and forced Duke Frederick II to <b>surrender</b> <b>the</b> three counties ceded to him during the Mongol invasion. On the other hand, Venice occupied Zadar in the summer of 1243. Béla renounced Zadar on 30 June 1244, but Venice acknowledged his claim to one third of the customs revenues of the Dalmatian town.|$|E

5|$|On April 13, 1855, a mutiny {{broke out}} among the artillerymen at Fort San Cristóbal. They were protesting an {{extended}} two years of military service imposed by the island's Spanish governor, Garcia Cambia.

5|$|On June 7, {{just two}} days after {{entering}} the city, Dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepted to shave their forehead, wear a queue, and <b>surrender,</b> <b>the</b> officials would be allowed to stay at their post. He had to repeal this command three weeks later after several peasant rebellions erupted around Beijing, threatening Qing control over the capital region.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 December 1807, a second raiding {{squadron}} under Pellew appeared off Griessie and demanded that the Dutch squadron in the harbour <b>surrender.</b> <b>The</b> Dutch commander—Captain Cowell—refused, and seized the boat party that had carried the message. Pellew responded by advancing up the river and exchanging fire with a Dutch gun battery on Madura Island, {{at which point the}} governor in Surabaya overruled Captain Cowell, released the seized boat party and agreed to <b>surrender</b> <b>the</b> ships at anchor in Gresik harbour. By the time Pellew reached the anchorage, however, Cowell had scuttled all of the ships in shallow water, and Pellew was only able to set the wreckage on fire. Landing shore parties, the British destroyed all military supplies in the town and demolished the battery on Madura. With the destruction of the force in Griessie, the last of the Dutch naval forces in the Pacific were eliminated. British forces returned to the region in 1810 with a large scale expeditionary force that successfully invaded and captured Java in 1811, temporary removing the last Dutch colony east of Africa.|$|E

5|$|Since Andros' {{commission}} included Connecticut, {{he asked}} Connecticut Governor Robert Treat to <b>surrender</b> <b>the</b> colonial charter {{not long after}} his arrival in Boston. Unlike Rhode Island, whose officials readily acceded to the dominion, Connecticut officials formally acknowledged Andros' authority, but did little to assist him. They continued to run their government according to the charter, holding quarterly meetings of the legislature and electing colony-wide officials, while Treat and Andros negotiated over the surrender of the charter.|$|E
5|$|Sweden had won {{its most}} prestigious victory, and Denmark had {{suffered}} its most costly defeat. Denmark {{was forced to}} yield the provinces of Scania, Halland, Blekinge and the island of Bornholm.

Denmark also had to <b>surrender</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian province Trøndelag to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Gythium {{was fought}} in 195 BC between Sparta and the {{coalition}} of Rome, Rhodes, the Achaean League and Pergamum. As the port of Gythium was an important Spartan base the allies decided to capture it before they advanced inland to Sparta. The Romans and the Achaeans were joined outside the city by the Pergamese and Rhodian fleets. The Spartans held out {{but one of the}} joint commanders, Dexagoridas, decided to <b>surrender</b> <b>the</b> city to the Roman legate. When Gorgopas, the other commander, found out, he killed Dexagoridas and took solo command of the city. After Dexagoridas' murder the Spartans held out more vigorously. However, Titus Quinctius Flamininus of the allied forces arrived with 4,000 more men and the Spartans decided to <b>surrender</b> <b>the</b> city on the condition that the garrison could leave unharmed. The result of this battle forced Nabis, the tyrant of Sparta, to abandon the surrounding land and withdraw to the city of Sparta. Later that year, Sparta capitulated to the allies.|$|E

5|$|After the French {{capitulation}} at Kehl (10 January 1797), Fürstenberg received additional {{forces with}} which he could end the siege at Hüningen.

General of Division Georges Joseph Dufour, the new French commander, pre-empted {{what would have been}} a costly attack, by offering to <b>surrender</b> <b>the</b> bridge. On 5 February, Fürstenberg finally took possession of the bridgehead.
