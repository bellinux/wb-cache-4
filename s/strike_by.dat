5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Mexican league incident, Robert Murphy, a former {{negotiator}} for the National Labor Relations Board, attempted {{to organize the}} Pittsburgh Pirates into a guild for purposes of collective bargaining.

Chandler worked with Pirates officials to avoid a threatened <b>strike</b> <b>by</b> the players. Part of Chandler's intervention included organizing a team of replacement players as a contingency plan; the team would have included Honus Wagner, who was 72 years old at the time.|$|E
