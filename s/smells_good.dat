This study investigates young people’s attitudes toward {{and beliefs about}} these alternative tobacco products. The study used data from a convenience sample survey of 5, 016 7 th- through 12 th-grade students in Massachusetts. The cigar attitudes receiving the highest endorsement levels were that cigars <b>smell</b> <b>good</b> and are something different to try, whereas the item receiving the lowest endorsement was that cigars {{give you a good}} buzz. The most endorsed bidi attitudes were that bidis look like joints and are something different to try. For kreteks, the most endorsed items were that kreteks <b>smell</b> <b>good</b> and are something different to try. Multivariate analyses found that reporting that these products tasted, <b>smelled</b> <b>good,</b> or were something different to try predicted use. Because the study was conducted with a convenience sample in one state, results do not necessarily generalize...|$|R

It is the same with silks, antiquities, shawls, etc. The place is crowded with people all the time, and as the gay-colored Eastern fabrics are lavishly displayed before every shop, the great Bazaar of Stamboul is one of the sights that are worth seeing. It is full of life, and stir, and business, dirt, beggars, asses, yelling peddlers, porters, dervishes, high-born Turkish female shoppers, Greeks, and weird-looking and weirdly dressed Mohammedans from the mountains and the far provinces --and the only solitary thing one does not smell when he is in the Great Bazaar, is something which <b>smells</b> <b>good.</b>|$|E
