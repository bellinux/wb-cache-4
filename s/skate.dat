5|$|The {{barndoor}} <b>skate</b> {{is one of}} five skates in the Gulf of Maine {{that has}} commercial value, but of those, the species that are most frequently targeted are the winter <b>skate</b> (Leucoraja ocellata) and the thorny <b>skate</b> (Amblyraja radiata). The barndoor <b>skate</b> is most commonly considered by-catch by commercial trawlers operating in the northwestern Atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using bottom trawling. When harvested, the flesh of the barndoor <b>skate</b> is used as bait, fish meal, pet food, and the meat from its wings is sold for human consumption. Since 1981, landings of skates have increased substantially, partly in response to increased demand for lobster bait, and more significantly, to the increased export market for <b>skate</b> wings. Currently, commercial retention and sale of barndoor <b>skate</b> is prohibited in the United States.|$|E
