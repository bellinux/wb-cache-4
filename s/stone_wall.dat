5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} {{party of}} 30 men was sent {{out from behind}} the third <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> to see if the British would try and flank the American position. The party ran into the British, who had continued to advance, and they fell back to the <b>stone</b> <b>wall.</b> The Americans behind the wall fired one volley before Glover gave the order to retreat. The Americans retreated across a bridge over the Hutchinson stream, their retreat covered by the 150 men of the 14th Continentals who engaged in an artillery duel with the British. Howe camped on a hill {{on the opposite side of}} the stream but made no attempt to cross the stream.|$|E

50|$|Linguist Nakamoto Masachie {{noted that}} in some dialects of Yaeyama, gusuku/gushiku means <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> {{themselves}} (not a structure with <b>stone</b> <b>walls)</b> and conjectured {{that this might be}} the original meaning of gusuku. According to Ono Masatoshi, gusuku has various meanings, depending on dialects of Yaeyama, including a partition of a mansion and <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> surrounding an agricultural field. Nakamatsu Yashū claimed that suku-like word forms were more prominent in Miyako and Yaeyama than gusuku.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{investigated}} the damage situation of masonry structures {{caused by the}} 2016 Kumamoto earthquake. In this paper, the damage situation of <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> in Kumamoto castle is reported and the mechanisms of failure and collapse of stones are discussed. The 3 -D laser scanner was also applied to obtain the 3 D geometry and the displacement/deformation of the <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> was analyzed by comparing with the previous measurement results before the earthquake. The 3 D laser scanning results clearly show the unnatural shape of the <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> caused by {{the movement of the}} backfill. This unnatural shape of the <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> can be observed even in the <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> which avoid the collapse. In the future, the evaluation of the safety/stability of the masonry walls is important for the restoration and 3 D digital data obtained by 3 D laser scanning technique will be useful. 研究ノー...|$|R

5|$|The British waited half an {{hour before}} attacking again. This time when they {{attacked}}, they attacked with all 4,000 men and seven cannon. The British bombarded the American position behind the <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> as their infantry advanced. The cannon fire was ineffective, and when the British were 50 yards away the Americans fired a volley which stopped the British infantry. The British returned fire, and musket and rifle fire ensued for 20 minutes, the British supported by cannon, at which point the lead American regiment fell back under cover of the next reserve regiment. The 3rd Continental Regiment was stationed behind the <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> {{on the opposite side of}} the road.|$|E
50|$|As for {{the outer}} castle, {{almost all the}} <b>stone</b> <b>walls,</b> mound lines and {{structures}} were demolished soon after the Meiji Restoration. The Hizen Moat and the Naka Moat were reclaimed and the Tojin-machiji-guchi Moat was converted into a culvert. However, {{a portion of the}} <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> to the south of the Higashi-toriire Gate and an upper portion of the northern <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> (bulwark) of the battery adjacent to the estuary of the Naka River can still be seen today.|$|R
50|$|All {{around the}} island of Tinos, the islanders have made the most unusual things out of stone. The hills are all terraced with <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> and every village is {{connected}} to its nearest neighbors by stone walkways set between a parallel set of <b>stone</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Of the {{original}} Fort Mifflin, only the white <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> {{of the fort}} still survive today.

Local residents know this siege and massive bombardment as the Battle of Mud Island.|$|R
5|$|A town borough was {{formally}} created in 1201, {{and by the}} 1220s there was a settlement established outside the castle gates; some of those residents who had been {{moved out of the}} bailey may have resettled there. Richard built a <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> around the new town, linking it to the castle defences, intending it both as a defensive measure and to impress visitors.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the {{archaeologist}} {{and historian}} Patrick Healy discovered {{the remains of}} a prehistoric wedge tomb in the woods. All the survives is the skeletal outline of the main chamber and the outer double walls. Most of the stones were removed to build the low <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> that runs across the front of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|In {{relation}} to the structure itself, the inner city is notable for the audience hall, which is an important representation of Serbian medieval architecture. High in the <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> on the Danube side, four sets of double-arched windows are carved in a combination of Gothic and Romanesque styles. This is where a merchant contract between the Republic of Venice and the Serbian Despotate was signed.|$|E
50|$|People {{had good}} access to local sources of stone, {{primarily}} basalt, which were {{often used in}} construction and tool-making. Lower Xiajiadian houses were typically round, made from mud and stone, and were built with <b>stone</b> <b>walls.</b> Lower Xiajiadian settlements were built near and were protected by cliffs or steep slopes. <b>Stone</b> <b>walls</b> were sometimes erected around the non-sloped perimeter of its settlement. Walls were not thick. Walls with watchtowers and were built by sandwiching a rammed earth core with two sides of <b>stone</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R

5|$|The 21st did {{not reach}} the <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> on Marye's Heights but took shelter in a very slight {{depression}} in the terrain, remaining pinned in that position until night. Under the cover of darkness, the regiment retired, only to be ordered to the same spot the next morning, expecting a Confederate counterattack which never came. The regiment lost {{a third of its}} numbers at Frederickburg.|$|E
5|$|The British {{attacked}} {{the position of}} the 3rd Continentals, and an engagement ensued. Both sides kept up constant fire, the Americans breaking the British lines several times. However, after 17 volleys, the British numbers began to overwhelm the Americans, and Glover ordered a withdrawal to another <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> on the crest of a hill while the next regiment in line, the 26th Continentals, engaged the British.|$|E
5|$|Thetford {{declined}} {{after the}} 12th century, and the castle rapidly became disused, although {{as late as}} 1558, the Castle Yard was in use and still {{said to have been}} surrounded with a <b>stone</b> <b>wall.</b> In 1772 the east bank of the outer bailey was destroyed. In 1823 a group of elm trees were planted {{near the top of the}} mound.|$|E

5|$|Edinburgh was {{formally}} {{established as a}} royal burgh by King David I of Scotland around 1125. This gave the town the privilege of holding a market, {{and the ability to}} raise money by taxing goods coming into the burgh for sale. It is probable, therefore, that some form of boundary was constructed around this time, although {{it may have been a}} timber palisade or ditch, rather than a <b>stone</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E

5|$|George Hunt leased {{the castle}} in 1841 {{and it was}} turned into a private house under the {{supervision}} of the architect George Guillame. Hunt remained at Netley until 1857, by when the castle had an oriel window overlooking the sea, and the battlements had been blocked in to allow the construction of a second storey to the building. George Sherriff leased the castle between 1868 and 1873, building a <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> around the front of property.|$|E
5|$|German paratroops {{attacked}} Crete on 20 May. Many paratroopers landed {{near the}} Div Cav positions and were beaten back. Cut {{off from the}} 10th Brigade headquarters, Russell followed Kippenberger's orders and withdrew to Galatas in Chania, to reinforce a Greek unit south of the village. At dusk, the regiment dug in near a <b>stone</b> <b>wall.</b> B Squadron held the right flank and C Squadron the centre; A Squadron and the 19th Battalion held the left, with the Greek unit in reserve.|$|E
5|$|Overlooking Old Grimsby harbour and the {{anchorage}} of St Helen's Pool, the blockhouse {{would have}} housed {{a battery of}} two or three artillery pieces, positioned on a square gun platform on top of a rocky outcrop.

A small room to provide living quarters for the garrison was later constructed {{on the side of the}} gun platform.|$|E
