50|$|Food {{processing}} in Bangladesh {{has traditionally}} been small scale, with domestic or family business using common processing knowledge for the conservation and handling of raw agricultural commodities to make them usable as food and feed. Although commercial scale food processing using modern technology especially for wheat and rice milling, mustard <b>seed</b> <b>crushing</b> and very limited bread and cookie manufacturing appeared during the 1960s, the growth of this sector did not gain momentum in terms of operational scale and quality until the 1980s. Recently the defining characteristics of the industry has been the processing of increasingly diverse products to meet the changing demands of the Bangladesh population. The major food processing sub-sectors in Bangladesh include dairy, edible oil, sugar, rice, wheat, fruit and vegetable, tea, poultry/beaf, pulses and spices and fish processing industries. Induced by the vigorous growth of the diverse middle class population of Bangladesh and the growing demands for additional consumption, the food processing sector is set to witness further hefty expansion in the coming years.|$|E

40|$|In 1750 {{the lower}} Medway Valley, {{the area between}} the towns of Maidstone and Rochester, was firmly part of Kent's 'Garden of England'. A century later, this tranquil, agrarian {{landscape}} had {{been transformed into a}} hive of industry and commerce, through the emergence of papermaking, cement manufacture, brickmaking, brewing, ship and barge building, <b>seed</b> <b>crushing</b> and engineering.

40|$|In rain forest, {{the large}} numbers of species of fleshy-fruited plants and frugivorous animals result in a large number of {{potential}} fruit-frugivore interactions, which are challenging to survey in the field. Yet, knowledge of these relationships is needed to predict consequences of changes in the frugivore assemblage for seed dispersal. In the absence of comprehensive dietary information, {{it may be possible to}} delineate between frugivores that disperse different plants using 'functional traits,' or morphological and behavioral attributes of frugivores that interact with differences in salient characteristics of plant species. Here we use data on the consumption of 244 Australian rain forest plant species by 38 bird species to test for associations between patterns of frugivory and birds': (1) degree of frugivory, (2) gape width, and (3) seed treatment (<b>seed</b> <b>crushing</b> or seed dispersing). Degree of frugivory and gape width explain 74 percent of the variation in the sizes of fruits consumed by frugivorous birds. Among birds that consume a substantial dietary proportion of fruit, birds with wider gapes consume larger fruits. In contrast, this relationship was not shown by birds for which fruit is only a minor dietary component. Degree of frugivory and gape width, together with seed treatment, also strongly predict the overall taxonomic composition and diversity of plants consumed by bird species. Functional classifications of frugivore species may prove useful in developing a predictive understanding of fruit-frugivore interactions in other rain forest regions where detailed dietary information is not available for most frugivores.

40|$|Canola {{meal was}} {{obtained}} from each of two oil <b>seed</b> <b>crushing</b> plants in the Prairies. One type of meal was derived predominantly from the seeds of Brassica napus, whereas the other was derived predominantly from the seeds of Brassica rapa. Proximate, amino acid, and protein electrophoresis analyses were conducted on each type of canola meal. It {{was found that the}} two types of canola meal resembled one another with respect to the components analyzed. The composition of the two canola meals was studied further by examining the indigenous microflora of the meals. The microbiological load of the meals was found to be relatively low and comparable to vegetable products which are processed. Twenty ­one species of filamentous fungi were isolated from the meal samples and identified at least to the genus level. Four species were found in both types of meal and were from the genera Aspergillus, Eurotian, Moniliella and Mucor. Strains unique to the Brassica napus meal occurred among the genera Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Hadrotrichum, Mucor and Penicillium. Strains unique to the Brassica rapa meal occurred among the genera Cladosporium, Monoascus, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Phoma, Polyscytalum, Rhizopus, and Rhizomucor. Several of the fungal strains isolated from the meal are known to be toxigenic and/or pathogenic to humans or livestock. The indigenous filamentous fungi of the meals were examined for their capacity to produce extracellular enzymes. A number of these species produced the enzymes necessary for the biotransformation of canola meal. In particular, Cladosporium sp., Mucor sp. M 1, Penicillium fellutanum, and Rhizopus stolonifer showed the capacity to degrade lignin or cellulose. The growth of the indigenous microflora in the meals resulted in a reduced nutritional quality of the meal. Canola meal biotransformed by its indigenous microorganisms had an elevated content of ash, total dietary fibre, and non-protein nitrogen. It was found that the dominant species resulting from the growth of the microbial population could be influenced by the use of differing levels of moisture in the meal. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity residing in the biotransformed meal samples was found to be correlated with the dominant species which resulted from the growth of the microflora. Two species of filamentous fungi know to have the capacity to degrade plant cell walls, Chaetomium cellulolyticum and Ganoderma colossus, were grown on the meal in a solid substrate fermentation process. It was found that C. cellulolyticum grew rapidly on the meal. The meal end product possessed less total dietary fibre and protein, and more ash and non-protein nitrogen than the untreated meal. Further examination revealed that C. cellulolyticum has a high capacity for rapid proteolysis of canola meal protein. The white-rot fungus G. colossus was also found to grow on canola meal and degrade meal fibre, but had less capacity to degrade meal protein than C. cellulolyticum. In relation to its control, incubation of G. colossus at 37 °C resulted in an increase in the essential amino acids lysine and valine, whereas incubation at 45 °C resulted in less proteolysis of meal proteins and encouraged ligninase activity...|$|E
40|$|Sunflower is {{the most}} {{important}} oilseed crop in South Africa and accounts for approximately 60 % of all oilseeds produced locally. The primary by-products of the sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>crushing</b> industry provides high-value inputs towards the food and animal feed manufacturing sector in the form of edible oil and protein meal. Prior to 1996, the South African sunflower seed complex market was controlled by the Oilseed Board, which operated a single-channel pool scheme and regulated the marketing of oilseeds and oilseed products. Since the liberalisation of the South African agricultural sector, role-players have been fully exposed to the dynamics and risks of the international oilseed complex market. Over the years participants in the agricultural commodity markets have developed various instruments to assist them in their decision-making process – one of them being commodity modelling, which is described as a methodological technique that provides a powerful analytical tool for examining the complexities of commodity markets. In South Africa, many role-players in the various agricultural industries make use of a multi-sector commodity level partial equilibrium model better know as the BFAP sector model which is maintained by the Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy (BFAP) at the University of Pretoria. The objective {{of this study was to}} expand the coverage of the existing BFAP sector model by developing a comprehensive system of equations for the total sunflower seed complex, which includes not only a partial equilibrium model for sunflower seed, but also sunflower oil and cake. In this study much emphasis was not only placed on the formation of prices of the various products, but also the application of the most suitable model structures in order to trace the behaviour of the various prices under real market conditions as accurately as possible. This study applied the methodology developed by the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) and further adapted by the Bureau for Food and Agriculture Policy (BFAP) to develop the partial equilibrium model of the South African sunflower complex. The single equations were estimated by mainly using ordinary least squares (OLS), but in cases where the results of the OLS were contradictory to the theory or where insufficient data was available, calibration techniques were employed and the equations were synthetically constructed. The constructed model was applied to lay down a baseline projection for the total production and consumption blocks of sunflower seed, oil and oilcake. The baseline projections also formed part of the ex post validation of the model’s performance. Finally the consistency of the model was evaluated in the form of scenario analysis. Various real-world market- and policy-related shocks were imposed and the results were compared to the baseline projections. In general the model developed in this dissertation performed well and can be used to analyse the effects of economic, technological and policy changes on the South African sunflower seed complex. It also provides a sound structure for the development of a complete South African oilseed complex model that includes soybeans, canola, groundnuts, cotton and imported palm oil.

40|$|The {{modern society}} {{recently}} {{became aware of}} the need to reduce pollutant emission in the environment and to have a sustainable development i. e. which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The substitution of fossil origin molecules by molecules from vegetables (biodegradable and renewable) could help to solve this problem at least in part : this would also limit our energy and/or material dependence. The lubricants, currently used in automobile industry, are mainly obtained from oil and pollute soils and water. Also, their substitution by bio-lubricants seems of a particu- lar importance. Vegetable oils are the main products likely to find industrial applications as alternative to petroleum products. However, the physicochemical properties (oxida- tion, temperature stability) of these natural substances are not yet competitive compared to those of usual lubricants. Nevertheless the linseed oil, once modified, could present interesting technical properties associated to a biodegradable character. To produce the oil initially contained in the seed cells, the oil industry developed around various pretreatments (mechanic, thermic, enzymatic) aiming at enhancing oil extraction, and expression as a central operation. A solvent extraction is then applied on the produced presscake. The objective {{of this study is to}} propose a new process for efficient oil extraction. This process had to be deprived of organic solvent (ecological aspect) and excessive heat treatment in order to preserve the various components of seed (economic aspect). First, we studied the effect of the <b>seed</b> <b>crushing</b> on expression. An optimal crushing allows to recover 70 % of the initial oil, which is comparable to industrial yield obtai- ned after crushing, cooking and expression. The study of seed maturity on expression highlights the need to have mature and dry seeds. An enzymatic preprocessing allows to discover a technological bolt due to the presence of mucilage (polysaccharides mixture) in the cuticule of seed. In order to extract mucilage, we propose an original solution based on the application of high voltage electric discharges (HVED) in water. In the second time, we sought to understand the phenomena during the electric discharge and calculate the energy consumption. After modeling of damped oscillations, recorded once the electric arc is created, we calculated the useful energy for the creation of the shock waves : the totality of the energy contained in the condenser is released during the discharge. It’s noticebale that only 25 % of this energy are used to generate shock waves. This treatment was then applied to the presscake produced after optimal crushing and expression. The mixture of presscake powder and water is treated by HVED then the resulting suspension is submitted to centrifugation to produce an emulsion as well as a solid residue. We then studied the effect of the pulse repetition frequency on the suspension and the produced emulsion physicochemical properties and on the composi- tion of the final products. The oil extraction kinetics and dry matter kinetics could be established and models are proposed. This process of extraction was finally optimized using an experimental design. Two successive treatments are thus applied by adjusting pH, temperature and mass of water. The total sum of applied impulses for the two treatments remaining constant and equal to 280. The oil extraction is favoured when the suspension is concentrated and the pH close to the average isoelectric pH of proteins of flax. Residues rich in oil (20 % of initial oil) and low in oil (2 % of initial oil) can be produced by adjusting the conditions of treatment. In conclusion, our study allowed us to propose a process with the following stages : crushing, expression, crushing, two treatments per electric discharge followed by centri- fugation. We propose two processes according to the results obtained with a forthcoming study concerning the separation of the produced emulsions. ...|$|E
