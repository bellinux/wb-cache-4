40|$|This {{technical}} report {{is aimed at}} providing a sound base to the revision process of the EU Ecolabel criteria for <b>Soil</b> <b>improvers</b> and Growing Media. Currently, separate sets of EU Ecolabel criteria exist for <b>Soil</b> <b>improvers</b> (Decision 2006 / 799 /EC) and Growing media (Decision 2007 / 64 /EC). The revision process spanned both product groups; thus common criteria for both <b>Soil</b> <b>improvers</b> and Growing media are developed, only distinguishing between technical product characteristics where necessary. Another objective of this revision is addressing the possibility to broaden the current scope to the product mulch, {{as it has been}} identified as a differentiated sub-product within the product group 'soil improvers'. To achieve those objectives, a Preliminary Report was produced together with the first version of this {{technical report}} as a working document. Hence, this document was developed to undergo the stakeholder consultation, which is crucial to come up with criteria adapted to the market reality while being able to select the best environmental performance products available on the market. After an extensive stakeholder's consultation process, this current version of the Technical Report supporting the draft criteria for growing media, <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> and mulch, constitutes the support of the criteria set voted positive by the Regulatory Committee.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} with the main objective of assessing the suitability of Tanzanian vermiculites as <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> for crop production through characterization. The research involved five samples from Tanzania and one from South Africa, which was included for comparison purposes. The results show that not all samples are vermiculites, some are hydrobiotites. Analysis shows {{that none of them}} contain hazardous accessory minerals. The samples have high cation exchange capacities (CEC) and, thus, they are suitable as <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> with ability to retain plant nutrients form leaching. Some have elevated concentrations of Cr and Ni, but the metals are insignificantly plant-available and do not inhibit the uptake of essential plant nutrients. Heating vermiculites above 600 °C should be avoided as it reduces the CEC by more than 90 %, and makes some of the exfoliated products strongly alkaline and, thus, unfavourable for crop production. The Tanzanian vermiculites can retain plant-available water, but their ability is less than vermiculite from South Africa. The P in the vermiculites is extractable and extractability increases on heating to 200 - 400 °C. Application of vermiculites to the soil significantly enhanced the retention and fertilization of P. Nitrogen and K were less retained. Maize vegetative growth, dry matter yield, and nutrient uptake were significantly enhanced by amending the soil with vermiculites. Pre-heated vermiculite at 600 °C performed better than unheated vermiculite and inhibited the fixation of the applied K and N. Thus, the Tanzanian vermiculites are suitable for use as <b>soil</b> <b>improvers</b> for crop production. However, more field trials are recommended on other types of soils and crops other than sand and maize used in this research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} methods {{currently available}} for the detection and enumeration of clostridia and enterococci in sludges and treated biowastes have been evaluated {{with a view to}} possible standardisation. The main methods used for the detection and enumeration of Clostridium and Enterococcus spp. have been developed largely for analysis of food and water and can be broadly divided into three groups. Quantification of colonies on agar media; most probable number (MPN) quantification in indicator broth using conventional test tube technology; and proprietary Quantitray® technology equivalent to the 5 -tube MPN technique employing disposable plastic trays for enumeration of enterococci. The merits of each are described. At least one report has suggested that the use of m-CP agar medium, which is used in the reference method in the European Union, is not suitable for recovering C. perfringens spores from groundwater. This questions its possible use as a method for detecting C. perfringens in sludge, soil, <b>soil</b> <b>improvers,</b> growing media, and biowaste. Indeed, all of the methods described for detection of C. perfringens and enterococci have strengths and weaknesses, dependent on not only the Regulators’ types of requirements for sludge, soil and biowaste analysis but also their sensitivity, specificity, speed and cost. Nevertheless, it is considered feasible to formulate horizontal standards to cover analysis of C. perfringens and enterococci in sludge, soil, <b>soil</b> <b>improvers,</b> growing media, and biowaste.

In this project Khorezm Sugar Company, operations in the factory and environmental problems in it have been studied. Impacts of defecation lime were described. The waste causes a lot of environmental and economical problems in the region. As it is dry and consists of particles with small size,defecat is easy spread able with the wind. It swells to nearest areas and could have impact on biodiversity as well as on health of people. Different modern methods of handling the defecation lime in Europe and Asian countries and new methods that are not in practice in large scales yet, were also described. These methods, such as: use of defecation lime as a <b>soil</b> <b>improver,</b> as a fertilizer, as an additive in greenhouse soil mixture, as a sorbent to treat waste water, as a micro filler incement production and foam concrete production and as a mineral additive in animal feeding. Advantages and disadvantages of these methods were examined. As an example the British Sugar and the Lime X division of the company were described. They obtain the same type of waste from sugar production. And use defecationlime as a <b>soil</b> <b>improver</b> to stabilize <b>soil</b> pH, to add organic matters to soil and improve soilstructure. The defecation lime is sold by 3 brands in the company, like: LimeX 45, LimeX 70 and LimeX Super 70 M. What they are doing and how they treat are described. As the main treatment method in the other sugar manufacturing companies, use of defecat as a <b>soil</b> <b>improver</b> was studied deeply. Therefore, soil characters of Uzbekistan have also been described. The fertilizer need in the country, especially in Khorezm region andcrops need for organic matters were overviewed. Different treatment methods of defecation lime, which are described in the thesis, are discussed to apply them in Khorezm Sugar.

In order to promote the utilization of such digestate products effectively, we need more information on their quality, safety, and applicability in crop production. We have used plant bioassays to evaluate the quality and potential phytotoxicity of various digestate products obtained from three full-scale biogas plants processing organic waste and by-products from agriculture, industry and municipalities in Finland.

The problem of measuring air flow rates through home compost bins was tackled by making comparisons with simultaneously run, forced-aeration sealed compost reactors at known air flow rates.
