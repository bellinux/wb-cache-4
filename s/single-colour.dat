25|$|Another knot {{frequently}} used in Persian carpets is the Jufti knot, which is tied around four warps instead of two. A serviceable carpet {{can be made}} with jufti knots, and jufti knots are sometimes used in large <b>single-colour</b> areas of a rug, for example in the field, to save on material. However, as carpets woven wholly or partly with the jufti knot need only half the amount of pile yarn compared to traditionally woven carpets, their pile is less resistant to wear, and these rugs do not last as long.|$|E
25|$|The updated one-colour {{version of}} the gem/pizza logo, created by Hubert Tison and Robert Innes, was {{introduced}} on January 1, 1986, and with it was introduced {{a new series of}} computer graphic-generated television idents for CBC and Radio-Canada. These idents consisted of different background colours corresponding to the time of day behind a translucent CBC gem logo, accompanied by different arrangements of the CBC's new, orchestrated five-note jingle. The logo was changed to one colour, generally dark blue on white, or white on dark blue, in 1986. Print ads and most television promos, however, have always used a <b>single-colour</b> version of this logo since 1974.|$|E
25|$|In general, Border Collies are {{medium-sized}} {{dogs with}} a moderate amount of coat, {{which is most}} often thick and sheds often. They have a double coat that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled. Whilst black and white is most commonly seen colour pattern of the Border Collie, the breed appears in just about any colour and pattern known to occur in dogs. Some of these include black tricolour (black/tan/white), liver and white, and red tricolour (red/tan/white) have also been seen regularly, with other colours such as blue, lilac, red merle, blue merle, brindle, and Australian red (also known as ee red, blonde, recessive red, or gold) which is seen less frequently. Some Border Collies may also have <b>single-colour</b> coats.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantages}} {{possessed by}} roller printing over all other processes are mainly three: firstly, its high productivity, 10,000 to 12,000 yards being commonly printed {{in one day}} of ten hours by a <b>single-colour</b> machine; secondly, by its capacity of being applied to the reproduction of every style of design, ranging from the fine delicate lines of copperplate engraving and the small repeats and limited colours of the perrotine to the broadest effects of block printing and to patterns varying in repeat from I to 80 in.; and thirdly, the wonderful exactitude with which each portion of an elaborate multicolour pattern can be fitted into its proper place, and the entire absence of faulty joints at its points of repeat or repetition consideration {{of the utmost importance}} in fine delicate work, where such a blur would utterly destroy the effect.|$|E
500|$|Barbarian was {{released}} in 1987 for the Commodore 64 and {{in the months that}} followed, most other home computers. [...] These machines were varied in their capabilities, and the software ported to them was modified accordingly. [...] The version for the 8-bit [...] is mostly monochromatic, displaying the outlines of the barbarians against <b>single-colour</b> backgrounds. [...] The sounds are recorded at a lower sampling rate. [...] Conversely, the version for the Atari ST, which has 16- and 32-bit buses, presents a greater variety of backgrounds and slightly higher quality graphics than the original version.

50|$|The colour of Bangkok taxi are {{in various}} colours {{including}} <b>single-colour,</b> bi-colour and <b>single-colour</b> with strip. The <b>single-colour</b> are a company taxi, personal taxi in cooperation or alliance and rental company taxi. These colour including bright green, bright sky blue, red, orange, yellow, blue, pink, purple, violet and tan. The bi-colour are in 3 kinds including yellow+green, red+blue and yellow+orange. The yellow+green are the personal private taxi. The red+blue are the rental taxi. The yellow+orange are the company taxi.|$|E

50|$|Several {{details of}} the car bore {{similarities}} with the station wagon designs of Bertone and Pininfarina in that period. The first examples of the SV-1600 had <b>single-colour</b> paint, while the front hood had a spoiler, which was something new for station cars.|$|E
50|$|LED strip {{designs are}} {{available}} populated with {{many different types}} of SMD, not only in different colours and addressable or non-addressable, by different shapes, sizes, and power levels. The most common types of SMD are: 3528, single colour, non-addressable, very low power; 5050, containing three LEDs allowing for RGB and addressable strips as well as higher power levels; 2835, a newer <b>single-colour</b> SMD having the same surface dimensions as the 3528 but a larger emitter area and a thinner design with an integrated heatsink allowing for higher power levels; 5630/5730, a newer replacement for <b>single-colour</b> 5050 SMDs which can operate at slightly higher power levels and have high efficacy. Less common designs may have 3014, 4014, 7020, 8020, or other SMDs.|$|E
50|$|After some time, a more luxurious {{version was}} produced, and bi-colour paint were applied, while new {{interiors}} were introduced. Starting from 1976, the SV-1600 received aluminium wheels, a new steering wheel, new side mirrors, and a <b>single-colour</b> paint with a black-and-white stripe on the sides. The car also had retractable seats for further enlarging the trunk space.|$|E
50|$|For <b>single-colour</b> work a {{stenciling}} {{machine was}} patented in 1894 by S. H. Sharp. It {{consists of an}} endless stencil plate of thin sheet steel that passes continuously over a revolving cast iron cylinder. The cloth to be ornamented passes between the two and the colour is forced onto it through {{the holes in the}} stencil by mechanical means.|$|E
50|$|Arakhchins {{could be}} sewn of various textiles, such as tirma wool and silk. However, only one <b>single-colour</b> textile per arakhchin was used. The textile {{was made into}} a round shape fitting the head and then {{decorated}} with embroidery, lace, beads and even pieces of gold. Men's arakhchins were relatively plain, especially those used for religious purposes.|$|E
50|$|The artwork in the station, {{entitled}} Immersion Land {{and created}} by the artist Stacey Spiegel, consists of panoramic posterized murals created from 150 digital photos rendered onto <b>single-colour</b> mosaic tiles. The artwork depicts rural scenery along Yonge Street or Highway 11 somewhere between Lake Ontario and North Bay, and {{is located on the}} upper (Sheppard line) platform level.|$|E
50|$|The {{researchers}} at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics thus speculated about new methods, and developed the optical frequency comb synthesizer. Its name {{comes from the fact}} that it generates a light spectrum out of what are originally <b>single-colour,</b> ultrashort pulses of light. This spectrum is made of hundreds of thousands of sharp spectral lines with a constant frequency interval.|$|E
50|$|Third: The third kit is an {{abstraction}} from previous alternate kits for Arsenal as it predominantly features a single colour of dark blue. A vibrant neon yellow forms the detail {{across a wide}} strip {{on the shoulder and}} on the cuffs of the sleeves. The shorts are also dark blue with neon yellow detail along the sides and the kit is completed with <b>single-colour</b> neon yellow socks with a single dark blue hoop on the upper section.|$|E

5000|$|A {{new series}} of stamps, {{engraved}} by Louis-Eugène Mouchon, was issued in 1897 and supplemented by additional values in 1898, 1899 und 1905. It comprised 19 nominals ranging from 2½ reis to 500 reis. Again, the 100 reis stamp was officially bisected for use on letters. These stamps were of the general <b>single-colour</b> design for Portuguese stamps at the time, but with the name [...] "Funchal" [...] and the value figure printed in black (on two values, in red). The 25 reis value was issued in 1899 in booklets containing six stamps each.|$|E
50|$|Roller {{printing}} {{was highly}} productive, 10,000 to 12,000 yards being commonly printed {{in one day}} of ten hours by a <b>single-colour</b> machine. It is capable of reproducing every style of design, ranging from the fine delicate lines of copperplate engraving to the small repeats and limited colours of the perrotine to the broadest effects of block printing with repeats from 1 in to 80 inches. It is precise, so each portion of an elaborate multicolour pattern can be fitted into its proper place without faulty joints at the points of repetition.|$|E
5000|$|St George {{played in}} <b>single-colour</b> jumpers to save costs, playing in purple in 1928 and in orange during World War II, but when Bill Cerutti became the club coach he {{recommended}} that it adopt the red-and-white-striped jumper of the Transvaal Club. This remained the club's uniform until {{the move to}} Sylvania. At this time Randwick was playing in red-and-white jumpers, but following requests from St George they changed their colours. The myrtle green that Randwick now play in, was adopted from the destination boards of the trams that ran to Coogee.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{decision}} involves colours. A <b>single-colour</b> cardboard {{model is}} easiest to construct [...] - [...] and some models {{can be made}} by folding a pattern, called a net, from a single sheet of cardboard. Choosing colours requires geometric understanding of the polyhedron. One way is to colour each face differently. A second way is to colour all square faces the same, all pentagonal faces the same, and so forth. A third way is to colour opposite faces the same. Many polyhedra are also coloured such that no same-coloured faces touch each other along an edge or at a vertex.|$|E

5000|$|A variant knot is the {{so-called}} jufti knot, which is woven around four strings of warp, with each loop of one single knot tied around two warps. Jufti can be knotted symmetrically or asymmetrically, open {{to the left or}} right. [...] A serviceable carpet can be made with jufti knots, and jufti knots are sometimes used in large <b>single-colour</b> areas of a rug, for example in the field.

50|$|Modern damasks are woven on {{computerized}} Jacquard looms. Damask weaves {{are commonly}} produced in monochromatic (<b>single-colour)</b> weaves in silk, linen, or synthetic fibres such as rayon and feature patterns of flowers, fruit, and other designs. The long floats of satin-woven {{warp and weft}} threads cause soft highlights on the fabric which reflect light differently according {{to the position of}} the observer. Damask weaves appear most commonly in table linens and furnishing fabrics, but they are also used for clothing. The Damask weave is used extensively throughout the fashion industry due to its versatility and high-quality finish. Damask is usually used for mid-to-high-quality garments, meaning the label tends to have a higher definition and a more “expensive” look.|$|E

5000|$|In 1880, a competitor, Payr and Mayer in Augsburg and its {{subsidiary}} in Mössingen {{were bought}} {{and the top}} management transferred to Bönnigheim. In 1882, Immanuel Böhringer retired leaving Alois Amann as the sole proprietor until he was joined by his sons, Emil Amann (1862 - 1935) and Alfred Amann (1863 - 1942), {{at which point the}} firm became known as Amann und Söhne. Emil’s pioneering experiments with synthetic fibres were abandoned when he decided that there was no substitute for real silk. There was expansion abroad with the purchase of two factories at Seriate and Telgate in Northern Italy. Emil Amann travelled throughout Europe on sales missions while his father and brother concentrated on the running of the factory. Colour dyeing was transferred in-house in 1884 as there had been complaints about the <b>single-colour</b> dyed silk that had previously been contracted out. No river flows through Bönnigheim and so a bore hole was sunk within the factory complex in 1886 to provide water for dyeing. [...] Alfred Amann followed apprenticeships in Lyon, London and Krefeld before returning to the firm in 1888 to take up the post of technical director. When Alois Amann died in 1892, the sons took over the business and continued in partnership until 1917 when Emil retired to Wiesbaden to live the life of a man of private means. [...] In 1893, the fusion with Payr and Mayer was completed. The Zabergäu Railway provided good communications with Güglingen and a branch was opened in that nearby town. This, however, did not prove a success and it was closed within a relatively short time. In 1900, a new 40 - 60 horsepower steam engine was installed at the Bönnigheim plant to generate electricity for lighting. Two years later, the factory was extended.|$|E
40|$|Two studies {{demonstrate}} {{that the need for}} coherence could nudge individuals to use structural similarities between binary visual displays and two concurrent cognitive tasks to unduly solve the latter in similar fashion. In an overt truth-judgement task, participants decided whether symmetric colourful displays matched conjunction or disjunction descriptions (e. g., "the black and/or the orange"). In the simultaneous covert categorisation task, they decided whether a colour name (e. g., "black") described a two-colour object or half of a <b>single-colour</b> object. Two response patterns emerged as follows. Participants either acknowledged or rejected matches between disjunction descriptions and two visual stimuli and, similarly, either acknowledged or rejected matches between single colour names and two-colour objects or between single colour names and half of <b>single-colour</b> objects. These findings confirm the coherence hypothesis, highlight the role of coherence in preserving working-memory resources, and demonstrate an interaction between high-level and low-level consciousness. 11 page(s...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method of {{producing}} single attosecond pulses by using a few-cycle (5 fs) driving pulse with two additional weak control pulses. We discuss how single attosecond pulses produced from high-order harmonic generation processes in a synthesized three-colour laser field {{are similar to those}} processes in a much shorter <b>single-colour</b> laser field. Based on the high-order harmonic spectrum, classical ionizing and returning energy maps, time-frequency maps and time profiles of the attosecond pulses, the actions of the synthesized three-colour laser field are analogous to a 3 fs field although some differences still exist, and our method is proved to be a potential way to reduce the attosecond pulse duration from high-order harmonic generation with a currently available ultrafast laser source instead of a shorter pulse...|$|E
40|$|Laser-induced {{magnetisation}} {{dynamics of}} a La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 /SrRuO 3 superlattice is studied {{by means of}} a <b>single-colour</b> optical pump-probe technique. Significant differences in the magnetisation dynamics of a superlattice with respect to the single layers of constituent materials are demonstrated. Below the Curie temperature T C of SrRuO 3, laser-induced ultrafast demagnetisation is found to be followed by a uniform precession of the magnetisation around its new equilibrium. The data is described within a simple model based on a displacive excitation of a precessional magnetisation dynamics. The model is shown to give a good fit to the experimental data. As the initial temperature approaches T C, the oscillations get suppressed and eventually vanish. The magnetisation dynamics is shown to depend on whether the two distinct magnetisation vectors in the superlattice are ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically aligne...|$|E
40|$|XUV and X-ray Free Electron Lasers (FELs) produce short {{wavelength}} pulses {{with high}} intensity, ultrashort duration, well-defined polarization and transverse coherence, {{and have been}} utilised for many experiments previously possible at long wavelengths only: multiphoton ionization, pumping an atomic laser, and four-wave mixing spectroscopy. However one important optical technique, coherent control, {{has not yet been}} demonstrated, because Self- Amplified Spontaneous Emission FELs have limited longitudinal coherence. <b>Single-colour</b> pulses from the FERMI seeded FEL are longitudinally coherent, and two-colour emission is predicted to be coherent. Here we demonstrate the phase correlation of two colours, and manipulate it to control an experiment. Light of wavelengths 63. 0 and 31. 5 nm ionized neon, and the asymmetry of the photoelectron angular distribution was controlled by adjusting the phase, with temporal resolution 3 attoseconds. This opens the door to new shortwavelength coherent control experiments with ultrahigh time resolution and chemical sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of potential diagnostic markers and target molecules among {{the plethora of}} tumour oncoproteins for cancer diagnosis requires facile technology {{that is capable of}} quantitatively analysing multiple biomarkers in tumour cells and tissues. Diagnostic and prognostic classifications of human tumours are currently based on the western blotting and <b>single-colour</b> immunohistochemical methods that are not suitable for multiplexed detection. Herein, we report a general and novel method to prepare single-band upconversion nanoparticles with different colours. The expression levels of three biomarkers in breast cancer cells were determined using single-band upconversion nanoparticles, western blotting and immunohistochemical technologies with excellent correlation. Significantly, the application of antibody-conjugated single-band upconversion nanoparticle molecular profiling technology can achieve the multiplexed simultaneous in situ biodetection of biomarkers in breast cancer cells and tissue specimens and produce more accurate results for the simultaneous quantification of proteins present at low levels compared with classical immunohistochemical technology...|$|E
40|$|Serial {{femtosecond}} crystallography at X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) offers unprecedented {{possibilities for}} macromolecular structure determination of systems prone to radiation damage. However, de novo structure determination, i. e., without prior structural knowledge, {{is complicated by}} the inherent inaccuracy of serial femtosecond crystallography data. By its very nature, serial femtosecond crystallography data collection entails shot-to-shot fluctuations in X-ray wavelength and intensity as well as variations in crystal size and quality that must be averaged out. Hence, to obtain accurate diffraction intensities for de novo phasing, large numbers of diffraction patterns are required, and, concomitantly large volumes of sample and long X-ray free-electron laser beamtimes. Here we show that serial femtosecond crystallography data collected using simultaneous two-colour X-ray free-electron laser pulses can be used for multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing. The phase angle determination is significantly more accurate than for <b>single-colour</b> phasing. We anticipate that two-colour multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing will enhance structure determination of difficult-to-phase proteins at X-ray free-electron lasers...|$|E
