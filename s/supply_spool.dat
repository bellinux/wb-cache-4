2500|$|A common {{mechanical}} problem {{occurred when}} a worn-out or dirty player rotated the <b>supply</b> <b>spool</b> {{faster than the}} take-up spool or failed to release the heads from the tape upon ejection. This would cause the magnetic tape to be fed out through {{the bottom of the}} cassette and become tangled in the mechanism of the player. In these cases the player was said to have [...] "eaten" [...] or [...] "chewed" [...] the tape, and it often destroyed the playability of the cassette altogether. Cutting blocks, analogous to those used for open-reel 1/4" [...] tape were readily available, though used mainly for retrieving valued recordings, could be used to remove the damaged portion, or repair the break in the tape.|$|E
50|$|The VCR format used large square {{cassettes}} with 2 co-axial reels, {{one on top}} of the other, containing {{half inch}} (12.7 mm) wide chrome dioxide magnetic tape. Three playing times were available: 30, 45 and 60 minutes. The 60-minute videocassettes proved very unreliable, suffering numerous snags and breakages due to the very thin 17μm video tape. Tapes of 45 minutes or less contained 20 μm thickness tape. The mechanically complicated recorders themselves also proved somewhat unreliable. One particularly common failing occurred should tape slack develop within the cassette; the tape from the top (takeup) spool may droop into the path of the bottom (<b>supply)</b> <b>spool</b> and become entangled in it if rewind was selected. The cassette would then completely jam and require dismantling to clear the problem, and the tape would then be creased and damaged.|$|E
40|$|A {{yarn carrier}} {{apparatus}} particularly suited {{for use in}} braiding machinery or the like due to its capability of continuous yarn feeding and retraction of long lengths of yarn. The yarn carrier apparatus comprises a yarn <b>supply</b> <b>spool</b> which is rotatably mounted within the housing, a spring motor also mounted within the housing and operatively connected to the yarn <b>supply</b> <b>spool</b> through a mechanical transmission assembly which is adapted to multiply rotational movement between the first element of the gear assembly operatively connected to the spring motor and the final element of the gear assembly operatively connected to the yarn <b>supply</b> <b>spool.</b> The spring motor is adapted to tension the yarn during both feeding and retraction thereof, and it is further adapted to periodically rotatably slip within the housing and partially unwind so as to allow for continuous withdrawal of a long length of yarn without the spring motor becoming fully wound and preventing further yarn retraction...|$|E

The Tsuzuki family has {{maintained}} residency in Nagoya, Japan and Greenville, South Carolina for many decades. Their connections to Greenville was through TNS Mills, which stood for Tsuzuki New Spinning, <b>supplying</b> <b>spools</b> of thread to the textile mills {{that were the}} heart of Greenville's economy.|$|R
40|$|The {{airborne}} {{rescue system}} includes a boom with telescoping members for extending {{a line and}} collar to a rescue victim. The boom extends beyond {{the tip of the}} helicopter rotor so that the victim may avoid the rotor downwash. The rescue line is played out and reeled in by winch. The line is temporarily retained under the boom. When the boom is extended, the rescue line passes through clips. When the victim dons the collar and the tension in the line reaches a predetermined level, the clips open and release the line from the boom. Then the rescue line can form a straight line between the victim and the winch, and the victim can be lifted to the helicopter. A translator is utilized to push out or pull in the telescoping members. The translator comprises a tape and a rope. Inside the telescoping members the tape is curled around the rope and the tape has a tube-like configuration. The tape and rope are provided from <b>supply</b> <b>spools...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mixing reel sizes between <b>supply</b> and takeup <b>spool</b> made fast winding {{still more}} complicated, and was {{discouraged}} or prohibited by almost all manufacturers. Even mixing metal and plastic flange reels {{of the same}} size was not supported by some machines.|$|R

50|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industries, {{coiled tubing}} refers to a very long metal pipe, {{normally}} 1 to 3.25 in in diameter which is <b>supplied</b> <b>spooled</b> on a large reel. It is used for interventions in oil and gas wells and sometimes as production tubing in depleted gas wells. Coiled tubing is often used to carry out operations similar to wirelining. The main benefits over wireline are the ability to pump chemicals through the coil and the ability to push it into the hole rather than relying on gravity. Pumping can be fairly self-contained, almost a closed system, since the tube is continuous instead of jointed pipe. For offshore operations, the 'footprint' for a coiled tubing operation is generally larger than a wireline spread, which can limit the number of installations where coiled tubing can be performed and make the operation more costly. A coiled tubing operation is normally performed through the drilling derrick on the oil platform, which is used to support the surface equipment, although on platforms with no drilling facilities a self-supporting tower can be used instead. For coiled tubing operations on sub-sea wells a Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) e.g. semi-submersible, Drillship etc. has to be utilized to support all the surface equipment and personnel, whereas wireline can be carried out from a smaller and cheaper intervention vessel. Onshore, they can be run using smaller service rigs, and for light operations a mobile self-contained coiled tubing rig can be used.|$|R

50|$|Having {{held their}} line, the 9th and 5th {{infantry}} began their boarding side boats and moving the skirmish line down river towards Point Pleasant. Loring's infantry fight progressed down the Kanawha shores {{well above the}} refugee fleet seemingly {{going to take the}} fight {{all the way to the}} mouth of the river. Lightburn had figured on rejoining the frontline troops at the mouth of the Kanawha where an Ohio artillery detachment set a trap for Loring's troops. Some historians have regarded this as one of the most intelligent execution of a military recall and retreat manoeuvre exercised. But, Loring knew when to stop his push. The Confederate occupation of six weeks was for the salt from which they caravan to the south to keep their meats <b>supply</b> from <b>spooling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Because the <b>supply</b> and take-up <b>spools</b> of the {{recording}} tape were no longer individually powered as in the UNITYPER 1, a mechanical solution consisting of a differential spring, ratching escapement and slip clutches was developed to overcome the problem of [...] "differential moment" [...] of accurately moving tape across the head. This was necessary because the supply reel is always decreasing in effective diameter while the take up reel is increasing in effective diameter as the tape moves from one reel to the other during encoding, and again when backspacing or rewinding.|$|R
25|$|The Correcting Selectric II used a new ribbon {{cartridge}} mechanism. The cartridge contained both <b>supply</b> and take-up <b>spools,</b> permitting both easy ribbon {{changes and the}} use of several types of ribbon on one machine. The ribbons were wider than had been used previously, giving more typed characters per inch of ribbon. Successive characters were staggered vertically on the ribbon, which incremented less than a full character position each time. Different types of ribbons had different-depth holes {{in the bottom of the}} cartridge, which set the mechanism to advance the ribbon by the amount appropriate for the type of ribbon.|$|R

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] paper discusses several practical {{issues related to}} the design of robust position controllers for hydraulic actuators by quantitative feedback theory (QFT). Important properties of the hydraulic actuator behavior, for control system design, are identified by calculating a family of equivalent frequency responses from acceptable nonlinear input-output data. The role of this modeling approach towards reducing over-design by decreasing the sizes of the QFT plant templates is described. The relationship between the geometry of the QFT bounds and the complexity of the robust feedback law is examined through the development of two low-order controllers having characteristics suitable for different applications. Experimental test results demonstrate the extent that each QFT controller is able to maintain robustness against variations in the hydraulic system dynamics that occur due to changing load conditions as well as uncertainties in the hydraulic <b>supply</b> pressure, valve <b>spool</b> gain, and actuator damping.

40|$|This report {{documents}} the design, fabrication, and testing for a marine biomass analyzer. The {{goal of the}} project and constructed system was to determine the validity and efficacy of a process that could flatten benthic macrofauna to a consistent thickness such that a biomass for the collected sample could be accurately determined. The system that was built and tested consists of a drive train that turns a mill subassembly where the organisms are flattened, <b>supply</b> and collection <b>spools</b> that hold the white fabric and clear film used to capture the organisms, a collection zone where the sample is injected, and a superstructure that supports the device for rigidity and positioning of components. Through clever design, we were able to minimize the parts required to locate and tension the spools, allowing them to be removed and resupplied quickly. Additionally, the number of lost organisms that were not captured was minimized to under 5 %. All components and fabrication were made using typical equipment found in a machine shop including a manual mill and lathe, laser cutter, 3 D printer, and general shop tools. A software package called Matlab was used for image processing to determine sample size and calculate a biomass given the interpreted surface area of the caught sample. Ultimately, we were able to design, build, and test a system and analytical process that could determine the biomass of a sample to within ± 10 % of its actual value. We consider our proof-of-concept design to be a success and can be further developed upon with new iterations. Eventually, this system could be incorporated into an autonomous underwater rover that simultaneously collects, filters, and scans benthic samples to determine biomass and biodiversity in oceanic environments...|$|R
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to design and {{fabricate}} a micro spindle turning (micro lathe) attachment with a micro EDG. The main hollow spindle of the former is positioned horizontally (can also be vertically, if required), located over two tungsten carbide V-bearings and steel ball as end-thrust bearing on a carbide support. This can be rotated about the horizontal axis by a balanced miniature DC motor via a belt-pulley system, reducing the spindle speed to about 3000 rpm (can also be either decreased or increased continuously). This spindle system may also be used as an attachment to any NC table of any type of EDM through its motor housing structure, to receive motions in the horizontal plane. The spindle accomodates micro collets on the free end for holding jobs from 0. 5 to 2 mm diameter. To ensure a compact mono block design with minimal components and low stray capacitance in the system, the entire housing and support structure is of single piece made of ABS plastic. The design and fabrication of a compact wire feeding mechanism for micro EDG ensures in situ processing of the micro tool on the spindle. Travelling wire is used as the tool electrode and moves around a carbide wire guide. The wire tension and speed are controlled using a spring loaded friction pad and directly driven wind-up system. The <b>supply</b> and wind-up <b>spools,</b> both are of insulating material sandwiching the friction pad and mounted on a shaft. A precision miniature geared (balanced epicyclical) DC servomotor drives the shaft. An insulating bracket developed n an FDM (RPT) system is used to hold the motor and shaft in place. A metallic tailstock centre supports the shaft at the other end. Horizontal and vertical pulleys are used to guide the wire perpendicularly and move it around the wire guide. The entire setup is mounted on a edge as opposed to problems of wire lag and vibration expereinced in wire EDM. The concept of the development is to incoporate both the systems to any configuration for micro EDMing. status: publishe...|$|R
