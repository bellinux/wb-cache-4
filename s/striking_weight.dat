40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the hypotensive action of the alkaloids of Rauwolfia serpentina (Chopra, 1933) many reports have appeared dealing with the chemistry, pharmacology, and clinical use of these drugs in hypertension. It is still difficult, however, to give a clear idea as to their exact place in therapy. Many workers have reported extremely good results, with a hypotensive response in one-half to three-quarters of the subjects treated (Hughes et al., 1954; Arnold and Bock, 1953; Hensler, 1953; Vakil, 1953; Chakravarty, 1951) while other reports are more disappointing with a satisfactory response in only 33 per cent (Wilkins and Judson, 1953) and 8 per cent of subjects treated (L 6 ffler, 1953). Nor is it clear from the reports what dosage should be employed. While Freis and Ari (1954) recommend a maintenance dose of 02 - 0 O 5 mg. reserpine daily others have found this dose completely ineffective and have employed 4 - 06 - 0 mg. daily of the same substance (Douthwaite, 1954). In a trial designed to clarify these points we were soon impressed by the <b>striking</b> <b>weight</b> increase of most subjects while on rauwolfia and by the appearance of cardiac failure in some. We accordingly modified our procedure to include a study of the influence of this drug on heart output, pulse rate, and fluid balance. The results of these observations are reported below...|$|E
40|$|Passive {{transfer}} of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) was achieved using the gamma globulin fraction and purified IgG from sera of rats immunized with Electrophus electricus (eel) acetylcholine receptor (AChR). This demonstrates {{the critical role}} of anti-AChR antibodies in impairing neuromuscular transmission in EAMG. Passive {{transfer of}} anti-AChR antibodies from rats with chronic EAMG induced signs of the acute phase of EAMG in normal recipient rats, including invasion of the motor end-plate region by mononuclear inflammatory cells. Clinical, eletrophysiological, histological, and biochemical signs of acute EAMG were observed by 24 h after antibody transfer. Recipient rats developed profound weakness and fatigability, and the posture characteristic of EAMG. <b>Striking</b> <b>weight</b> loss was attributable to dehydration. Recipient rats showed large decreases in amplitude of muscle responses to motor nerve stimulation, and repetitive nerve stimulation induced characteristic decrementing responses. End-plate potentials were not detectable in many muscle fibers, and the amplitudes of miniature end-plate potentials were reduced in the others. Passively transferred EAMG more severely affected the forearm muscles than diaphragm muscles, though neuromuscular transmission was impaired and curare sensitivity was increased in both muscles. Some AChR extracted from the muscles of rats with passively transferred EAMG {{was found to be}} complexed with antibody, and the total yield of AChR per rat was decreased. The quantitative decrease in AChR approximately paralleled in time the course of clinical and electrophysiological signs. The amount of AChR increased to normal levels and beyond at the time neuromuscular transmission was improving. The excess of AChR extractable from muscle as the serum antibody level decreased probably represented extrajunctional receptors formed in response to functional denervation caused by phagocytosis of the postsynaptic membrane by macrophages. The amount of antibody required to passively transfer EAMG was less than required to bind all AChR molecules in a rat's musculature. The effectiveness of samll amounts of antibody was probably amplified by the activation of complement and by the destruction of large areas of postsynaptic membrane by phagocytic cells. A self-sustaining autoimmune response to AChR was not provoked in animals with passively transferred EAMG...|$|E

Air Wakes are huge source of vibrational energy and these vibrations are harnessed using energy regenerative engineering technology. The lifting aircraft produces turbulent air wakes, which <b>strike</b> light <b>weight</b> swinging elliptical dish plates along sides of the runway.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the surfaceâ€“player interaction in female football players between natural and artificial turf. Methods: Eight university level female football players performed an unanticipated cutting manoeuvre at an angle of 30 Â° and 60 Â°, on a regulation natural grass pitch (NT) and a 3 G artificial turf pitch (AT). An automated active maker system (CodaSport CXS System, 200 Â Hz) quantified 3 D joint angles at the ankle and knee during the early deceleration phase of the cutting, defined from foot <b>strike</b> to <b>weight</b> acceptance at 20 % of the stance phase. Differences were statistically examined using a two-way (cutting angle, surface) ANOVA, with an Î± level of pÂ <Â  0. 05 and Cohen's d effect size reported. Results: A trend was observed on the AT, with a reduction in knee valgus and internal rotation, suggesting a reduced risk of knee injury. This findings highlight that AT is no worse than NT and may have the potential to reduce the risk of knee injury. The ankle joint during foot strike showed large effects for an increase dorsiflexion and inversion on AT. A large effect for an increase during weight acceptance was observed for ankle inversion and external rotation on AT. Conclusion: These findings provide some support for the use of AT in female football, with no evidence to suggests that there is an increased risk of injury when performing on an artificial turf. The ankle response was less clear and further research is warranted. This initial study provides a platform for more detailed analysis, and highlights the importance of exploring the biomechanical changes in performance and injury risk with the introduction of AT...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} analysis of shortcomings {{and benefits of}} individual techniques for the capital repair of out-of-commission water wells of standard designs. The author considers the capital repair procedure of water well No 3 B of Zhodino â€˜Severniyâ€™ water supply point by means of installing a repair filter of smaller diameter inside the failed one, cushioning the tubular annulus with gravel. It is shown {{that this kind of}} repair can be considered a temporary arrangement inasmuch as the water well specific yield and service life period will reduce significantly. For prolongation of the useful life of the water wells, the paper suggests performing preliminary unloading of their filters. The study reveals that the well capital repair by means of extracting the old filter and exchanging it with a new one can be complicated by the column burst along the welding joints working in tension. The performed column strength test demonstrated the fact that the required heave might exceed the welding joint tolerant tensile force owing to considerable friction of the column against the ground. The author arrives at a design equation of the heave required for extracting the production column with the filter applying only the static force. In which they offer to determine frictional force of the mudded filter against the formation from calculating formulae of the supporting power of an augered pile working with pulling loads. For decreasing the heaves via reducing frictional loads of the mudded filter against the formation, an improved design of the water well has been introduced recognized as an invention with the filter capable of downward biasing. Such water well design allows at the filter mud fill in the first instance the entire filtering column to be biased (knocked) down inside a special sleeve placed lower the settler by applying external buffing force, and then only extracting the filtering column out of the well by decreased traction pull.

5000|$|The unique {{plantigrade}} {{alignment of}} the human foot results in a distal-limb structure that can adapt {{to a variety of}} conditions. The less mobile and more robust tarsal bones are shaped and aligned to accept and transmit large loads during the early phases of stance (initial contact and loading response phases of walking, and inadvertent heel strikes during running). The tarsals of the midfoot, which are smaller and shorter than the hindfoot tarsals, appear well oriented to transmit loads between the hindfoot and forefoot; this is necessary for load transfer and locking of the foot complex into a rigid lever for late stance phase. Conversely, the midfoot bones and joints also allow for the transmission of loads and inter-joint movement that unlocks the foot to create a loosely packed structure which renders the foot highly compliant over a variety of surfaces. In this configuration, the foot is able to absorb and damp the large loads encountered during heel <b>strike</b> and early <b>weight</b> acceptance. [...] The forefoot, with its long metatarsal and relatively long phalanges, transmits loads during the end-of-stance phase that facilitate the push-off and transfer of forward momentum. The forefoot also serves as a lever to allow balance during standing and jumping. In addition, the arches of the foot that span the hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot {{play a critical role in}} the nature of transformation of the foot from a rigid lever to a flexible weight-accepting structure.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the present work was to investigate the effect of the change in dynamic energy on the compaction of soils. The energy was changed by altering; height of drop, diameter of <b>striking</b> face or <b>weight</b> of rammer. The film theory, advanced to interpret the compaction phenomena, has been, discussed {{in the light of the}} present work and led to the development of a new theory which is capable of interpreting all phenomena encountered in compaction. A general equation has been derived, and proved dimensionally, to determine the max. density of any type of soil compacted under dynamic energy, once the mechanical analysis and specific gravity of the soil are known. Another general equation has been derived to determine the optimum moisture content of any type of soil. An investigation, on the effect of compaction under static loads on tensile-strength, of Staines and Blue London Clays and Clayey Brickearth is given in, the course of this thesis. A new device was developed to measure the tensile strength as low as 2 lb/sq. in. Such investigations have shown that compaction increases the tensile strength of clays, which in turn increases with increase in compactive effort. The effect of the spent lye, from the paper industry, and hydrated lime on the compaction characteristics bios and stabilization of London Clay, has been investigated. The spent lye from the sulphite process reduces the capillary water absorption of the clay. Hydrated lime, which is cheaper than cement, is very effective in amounts of 10 %, for the stabilization of London Clay. Furthermore, it implies higher strengths than that of cement and is a good waterproofing agent which maintains high strengths under severe conditions...|$|R
40|$|Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is {{an immune}} {{mediated}} {{disease of the}} central nervous system (CNS). The aetiology is unknown, but environmental factors as well as multiple separate genetic loci contribute to the disease susceptibility. Much research in the last decades has focused on the genetic basis of MS, but increasing evidence is emerging for major impact of environmental risk factors. Research on environmental risk factors is important since they offer a potential for disease prevention. The present study was designed to evaluate and add new knowledge to the role of environmental risk factors associated with the disease. The specific objectives were: A) Explore whether diet intervention with n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) could influence MRI disease activity, microglia activation, de- and remyelination in the cuprizone model for demyelination (Paper I). B) Assess if diet intervention with n- 3 PUFAs from two different sources could prevent behavioural changes in the cuprizone model for demyelination (Paper II). C) Describe and characterise a case series of patients with co-occurrence of vitamin D dependent rickets (VDDR 1) and MS (Paper III), D) Study if relapses in MS were associated with reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (Paper IV). E) Examine changes in gene expression in cortical lesions, normal appearing grey matter and meninges of MS patients. Perform an immunohistochemical characterisation of these brain sections and determine if active replication or latent infection with EBV was present in the sections examined (Paper V). The prevalence of MS is lower in the northern than in the southern parts of Norway. Since the prevalence of MS is known to normally increase with the distance from equator, this is an anomalous distribution of the disease compared to most other parts of the world. One widely accepted hypothesis for this distribution is that the inhabitants in the northern parts of Norway have a higher consumption of fatty fish than in the south, and that some substances in the fish (vitamin D or n- 3 fatty acids) offer protection against MS. Two of the papers in this thesis investigate the role of nutrition and diet modification for the susceptibility to demyelinating diseases. We used an animal model for MS (the cuprizone model) in order to study how diet modification with fatty fish or fish oils could influence the disease course, MRI activity, de- and remyelination in this animal model. Sixty-three mice were fed either a diet enriched with 1) salmon filets, rich in n- 3 fatty acids, 2) cod liver oil rich in n- 3 fatty acids or 3) soybean oil rich in n- 6 fatty acids. Cuprizone was added to the different diets. In the first study (Paper I), we found that the mice fed a salmonenriched diet had less MRI disease activity and demyelination than the two other groups. In the second study behavioural changes to cuprizone treatment were assessed with the elevated-plus-maze test (EPM). There were <b>striking</b> differences in <b>weight</b> loss, anxiety behaviour and activity levels, with a more favourable clinical outcome for the mice given a diet enriched with salmon filets (Paper II). The findings from these two studies indicated that diets rich in fatty fish could have protective effects against demyelination. There were no effects of giving n- 3 supplements in the form of cod liver oil, indicating that other substances than the fatty acids could have accounted for the effect of a salmon based diet. Future studies should aim at isolating the active component in the fish diet, as this could offer a valuable treatment supplement for demyelinating diseases. Three of the papers deal with the most studied and recognised environmental triggers of MS, Vitamin D and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The third study (Paper III) identified three patients with a rare hereditary form of rickets (VDDR 1). All of these patients later developed MS. These findings indicated rickets as a possible risk factor for MS and supported the theory that early childhood or the intrauterine periods are the main susceptibility periods for low levels of vitamin D. The next study (Paper IV) was designed to analyse whether there was an association between exacerbations in MS and reactivation of latent EBV. Sixty-one patients were followed for one year and blood samples were taken in the case of exacerbations or if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated evidence of new enhancing lesions. All the 61 patients (100 %) were anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG positive, one (2 %) was anti-VCA IgM positive and 60 (98 %) were anti- Epstein Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) positive. Mean anti-early antigen (EA) -D IgG at baseline was 0. 57 (range 0. 12 - 2. 70) and at the time of exacerbations 0. 61 (range 0. 11 - 2. 70). As demonstrated in earlier studies, all the patients in this sample had evidence of previous EBV infections, indicating that EBV could have a role in the pathogenesis of MS. There were, however, no signs of EBV-reactivation at the time of relapse. Thus, this study concluded that EBV reactivations do not {{play a significant role in}} MS exacerbations. The last study (Paper V) was designed to examine changes in gene expression in cortical lesions and in normal appearing grey matter from patients with MS. We observed a strong activation of immunoglobulin (Ig) -related genes in cortical sections of MS patients. The Ig-genes with the strongest activation were mostly variable and constant regions of the kappa and lambda light chains, but also included genes encoding heavy chains for IgM and IgG. No upregulation of Fc-receptor (FcR) genes was found. The cortical sections were immunohistochemically stained for plasma cells, Igs, T- and B-lymphocytes. The stainings revealed Ig-deposition in the meninges of the MS-patients compared to the controls. There were few B-lymphocytes and no B-lymphocyte follicles. Plasma cells were present in the meninges of all the MS patients but not in any of the controls. The activation of Ig-genes observed in the present study was highly interesting, as the synthesis of oligoclonal IgGs have been hypothesised to be caused by activation of EBV infected B-lymphocytes. The samples were screened for the presence of EBV by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry, but no evidence of active or latent EBV infection was detected. This study demonstrated that genes involved in the synthesis of Igs are upregulated in MS patients, and that this upregulation seems to be caused by a small number of plasma cells located in the meninges. Further, it concluded that EBV infected cells were not necessary for this Ig-upregulation. The findings indicated that the oligoclonal band (OCB) producing B-lymphocytes found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS-patients could have meningeal origin...|$|R
