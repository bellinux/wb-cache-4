In addition, two different air supply rates will use to investigate the effect of air supply rate on contaminant removal efficiency. The CO 2 was used as the tracer gas and decay method was adopted to measure the CO 2 concentration of each individual sample point. Four CO 2 record trees were installed in the test chamber and each tree has two sample points.

40|$|The {{major problem}} with {{ventilation}} distribution calculations using DIR and 4 DCT is the motion artifacts in 4 DCT. Quite often not all phases would exhibit mushroom motion artifacts. If the ventilation series similarity is sufficiently robust, the ventilation distribution {{can be calculated}} using only the artifact-free phases. This study investigated the ventilation similarity among the data derived from different respiration phases. Fifteen lung cancer cases were analyzed. In each case, DIR was performed between the end-expiration phase and all other phases. Ventilation distributions were then calculated using the deformation matrices. The similarity was compared between the <b>series</b> <b>ventilation</b> distributions. The correlation between the majority phases was reasonably good, with average SCC values between 0. 28 and 0. 70 for the original data and 0. 30 and 0. 75 after smoothing. The better correlation between the neighboring phases, with average SCC values between 0. 55 and 0. 70 for the original data, revealed the nonlinear property of the dynamic ventilation. DSC analysis showed the same trend. To reduce the errors if motion artifacts are present, the phases without serious mushroom artifacts may be used. To minimize {{the effect of the}} nonlinearity in dynamic ventilation, the calculation phase should be chosen as close to the end-inspiration as possible...|$|E

In the upper section were placed a <b>series</b> of <b>ventilation</b> openings. The availability of lengths of trees suitable for splitting slabs influenced this decision. Sections of the outer iron bark slab walls were arranged to ensure that joining studs in the wall would meet tie beams in the ceiling. This junction is noticeable along the top plate.

The front ends are differenced mainly by the use of dual chrome bumpers in place of twin trapezoidal grilles, but the similarities end at the B-pillar.Giorgetto Giugiaro at Italdesign was commissioned the transformation of his last work the Bora into the Merak. Unlike its bigger sister the Merak doesn't have a true, fully glassed fastback, but rather a cabin ending abruptly with a vertical rear window and a flat, horizontal engine bonnet pierced by four <b>series</b> of <b>ventilation</b> slats. Giugiaro completed the vehicle's silhouette by adding open flying buttresses, visually extending the roofline to the tail.The main competitors of the Merak were the similarly Italian, mid-engined, 3-litre and 2+2 Dino 308 GT4 and Lamborghini Urraco P250. However unlike its transverse V8-engined rivals the Merak used a more compact V6, that could therefore be mounted longitudinally.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: CO(2) -pneumoperitoneum used in {{endoscopic}} surgery induces system effects by CO(2) absorption. This {{study investigated the}} effect of the addition of O(2) to CO(2) -pneumoperitoneum, upon CO(2) absorption. METHODS: The effect of a pneumoperitoneum using 100 % CO(2) or 94 % CO(2) + 6 % O(2) upon arterial blood gases, acid base and O(2) homeostasis was evaluated. In <b>series</b> A suboptimal <b>ventilation</b> and a pneumoperitoneum pressure (PP) of 10 mmHg was used. In <b>series</b> B adequate <b>ventilation</b> and PP of 6 mmHg was used. RESULTS: CO(2) -pneumoperitoneum profoundly affected blood gases and acid base homeostasis i. e. increasing pCO(2), HCO(3) (P < 0. 001) and lactate concentrations (P < 0. 05) and decreasing pH, actual base excess and standard bicarbonate (P < 0. 001), resulting in metabolic hypoxaemia with desaturation, lower pO(2) (P < 0. 001) and O(2) Hb (P < 0. 05). These effects were more pronounced with higher PP and suboptimal ventilation. CONCLUSION: CO(2) -pneumoperitoneum profoundly affected blood gases and acid base homeostasis resulting in metabolic hypoxaemia. The addition of 6 % of O(2) to the CO(2) -pneumoperitoneum prevented these effects to a large extent. If these preliminary data are confirmed in the human, the addition of a few percent of O(2) to CO(2) could become important for {{endoscopic surgery}} of long duration, especially in obese patients with limited cardiorespiratory adaptation and steep Trendelenburg. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{concern of}} this investigation is to develop the capability to simulate the dynamic effects of a tornado depressurization on a ventilation system. The basic formulation and solution of the two-zone <b>series</b> model <b>ventilation</b> subsystem is based on lumped parameter component response equations, the isothermal compression of air, and the conservation of mass. Solutions based on these assumptions are also presented for the two-zone series model with natural bypass, the two-zone series model with recirculation, and the natural branching model. A parameter study is presented comparing the effects of changes in system resistance, system capacitance, and variable tornado depressurization rates. The adaptability of the basic formulation to adiabatic compression of air {{and the addition of}} duct resistance is examined. A quasi-steady formulation is introduced and preliminary considerations of the importance of inertia are presented. Preliminary conclusions in this area indicate that inertial effects can be neglected. For relatively long ducts slow shock development appears possible. Work on the effect of tornado depressurization rates as related to shock development and on the importance of inertia effects is continuing. (auth...|$|R
50|$|The American pressed fiber sun helmet {{is known}} for the {{simplicity}} of its design, allowing for easy mass production. An important feature in the original conception of the helmet was to be shaped and contoured from one singular piece. This greatly assisted in making the helmet waterproof. The fiber material kept the helmet light and the soldier unencumbered by headgear. The major drawback in the design was heat. Despite being designed with a <b>series</b> of <b>ventilation</b> holes, {{the interior of the}} helmet would eventually become hot in the sun. The chin straps for the World War II model were made by General Fibre Company and Hawley Products Company, the same fiber liner used in the original M1 helmets. The design of the International Hat and Hawley Product versions of the helmet are almost identical. However, the defining difference in identification is that the Hawley Product model has four folds with a wider space between them in the faux puggaree. A puggaree is a type of Indian turban, namely a thin muslin scarf tied around a sun helmet. The International Hat has five thin folds in its faux puggaree.|$|R
40|$|A <b>series</b> of <b>ventilation</b> {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} to assess the potential retention of diesel exhaust constituents in the North Ramp of the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project`s Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF). Measurements were taken to help evaluate {{the potential impact of}} retained diesel exhaust constituents on future in-situ experiments and long-term waste isolation. Assessment of the diesel exhaust retention in the ESF North Ramp required the measurement of air velocities, meteorological measurements, quantification of exhaust constituents within the ventilation air stream, multiple gas sample collections, and on-line diesel exhaust measurements. In order to assess variability within specific measurements, the experiment was divided into three separate sampling events. Although somewhat variable from event to event, collected data appear to support pre-test assumptions of high retention rates for exhaust constituents within the tunnel. The results also show that complete air exchange in the ESF does not occur within the estimated 16 to 20 minutes derived from the ventilation flowrate measurements. Because the scope of work for these activities covered only measurement and acquisition of data, no judgment is offered by the author as to the implications of this work. Final analyses and decisions based upon the entire compendium of data associated with this investigation is being undertaken by the Repository and ESF Ventilation Design Groups of the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project...|$|R
50|$|Gribbles bore into {{wood and}} plant {{material}} for ingestion as food. The cellulose of wood is digested, most likely {{with the aid}} of cellulases produced by the gribbles themselves. The most destructive species are Limnoria lignorum, L. tripunctata and L. quadripunctata. Due to dispersal while inhabiting wooden ships, it is uncertain where these three mentioned species originated. Limnoriidae are second only to the Teredinidae in the amount of destruction caused to marine timber structures such as jetties and piers. L. tripunctata is unusually tolerant of creosote, a preservative often used to protect timber piles, due to symbiosis with creosote-degrading bacteria. Gribbles bore the surface layers of wood, unlike the Teredinidae which attack more deeply. Their burrows are 1-2 mm diameter, may be several centimetres long, and have the burrow’s roof punctured with a <b>series</b> of smaller <b>ventilation</b> holes. Attacked wood can become spongy and friable.|$|R

An optimal technique guarantees a significant response to pure oxygen in well-ventilated lung tissue. To improve the sensitivity, we investigated the effect of ECG and respiratory triggering. Centric reordered single-shot rapid acquisition relaxation enhancement sequences (TE 4. 2 ms, echo spacing 4. 2 ms, bandwidth 650 Hz/pixel), with an inversion recovery preparation pulse (TI 700 ms), were used. Series of 20 measurements were performed with and without ECG and respiratory triggering in five young volunteers. Subsequently, series of 100 images were acquired during breathing normal air and pure oxygen (as "stimulus"). Ventilation maps showed by means of the z-score how far the response deviates from the signal intensities during the normal air condition. The standard deviation of the lung signal intensities was lowest for the cardiac-triggered <b>series.</b> In the <b>ventilation</b> maps, on the other hand, signal changes were statistically more significant in the respiratory than in the cardiac-triggered series. The average z-scores in the right (left) cranial part of the lung were 12. 4 (13. 0) and 9. 2 (9. 7) for respiratory and ECG-triggered acquisitions.

40|$|International audienceAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) has a {{mortality}} {{estimated at}} 50 %. Its management relies on mechanical ventilation {{to support the}} respiration. However, {{it is estimated that}} 25 % of the deaths might be avoided if the parameter setting of the ventilation is better adapted to the patients. A new medical research study, started by the team of Réanimation Médicale, Hôpital de la Croix-Rousse, Lyon, France, using an animal model (piglets) with ARDS induced, aims to analyze the response of the lung to mechanical ventilation. The study uses computed tomography (CT) images to quantify the aeration. This task requires the delimitation of the lung in the images. However, in the case of ARDS, this delimitation is hindered by the reduced contrast between the lung and the surrounding structures. Traditional lung segmentation methods are not suited for those images. In this work, a method for the quantification of aeration in CT images for the medical study is presented. The method takes advantage of the acquisition protocol of the medical study. The protocol has two trials, each one uses a <b>series</b> of <b>ventilation</b> conditions (combination of pressure and volume). For each ventilation condition an image is acquired. First, a registration process is started. Beginning with the trial of decreasing pressure and constant volume (Vk), the image with the highest pressure I (Pmax,Vk) is registered to the image with the next lower pressure I(Pmax− 1,Vk). Then, the process continues in a cascade way, registering I(Pi,Vk) to I(Pi− 1,Vk) until the last pressure I(Pmin,Vk) is reached. The same process is used in the increasing volume and constant pressure (Pr) trial until the maximum volume image I(Pr,Vmax) is reached. The starting image is taken from the precedent trial as the one that has the closest pressure to Pr. Once all the images are registered, the result of an automatic lung segmentation performed on the image I(Pmax, Vk) is transformed to the other images using the deformation fields found in the registration process. Finally, the aeration in each image is quantified using the lung segmentation to delimit the quantification. Results over 16 pigs (502 images) were visually inspected by an expert. The segmentations were found consistent within the ventilation conditions. The quantification showed an expected tendency with respect to the behavior of the aeration in the different ventilation conditions. The proposed method quantifies the aeration in different mechanical ventilation conditions in an animal model with ARDS induced. The results are visually consistent and satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model for oxygen transport assuming a <b>series</b> linkage of <b>ventilation,</b> diffusion, oxygen uptake by erythrocytes, cardiac output, and oxygen release {{was used to}} calculate expected values for maximal oxygen intake (VO 2 max) of patients with various pulmonary disorders 22 patients with either restrictive or obstructive ventilatory impairment were studied at rest and maximal exercise. When exercise measurements of maximal pulmonary blood flow (QCmax), oxygen capacity, membrane diffusing capacity for CO, pulmonary capillary blood volume, alveolar ventilation, and mixed venous oxygen saturation were employed as input values, predictions of VO 2 max from the model correlated closely with measured values (r = 0. 978). Measured VO 2 max was 976 +/- 389 ml/min (45. 3 +/- 13 % of predicted normal), and VO 2 max predicted from the model was 1, 111 +/- 427 ml/min. The discrepancy may in part reflect uneven matching of alveolar ventilation, pulmonary capillary blood flow, and membrane diffusing capacity for CO within the lung; uniform matching is assumed in the model so that mismatching will impair gas exchange beyond our predictions. Although QCmax was less than predicted in most patients (63. 6 +/- 19. 6 % of predicted) the model suggests that raising QCmax to normal could have raised VO 2 max only 11. 6 +/- 8. 8 % {{in the face of}} existent impairment of intrapulmonary gas exchange. Since pulmonary functions measured at rest correlated well with exercise parameters needed in the model to predict VO 2 max we developed a nomogram for predicting VO 2 max from resting CO diffusing capacity, the forced one second expired volume, and the resting ratio of dead space to tidal volume. The correlation coefficient between measured and predicted VO 2 max, by using this nomogram, was 0. 942...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the multiple steady state behavior, an important observation in numerical and experimental studies in natural ventilation systems. The-oretical models are developed and their applications in numerical simulations and ventilation controls are presented. In {{a system with}} multiple steady states, how the system reaches different steady states {{is determined by the}} initial values of the systems and the dynamical system characteristics of the system. Mathematical models are developed to model the dynamical system behavior of a <b>series</b> of <b>ventilation</b> systems, ranging from simple single-zone systems to complex systems with thermal mass. More importantly, we found that the system can transform from one steady state to another under sufficient perturbations (disturbances) when multiple steady states exist. A successful transition is determined by both the magnitudes and durations of the perturbations. The transition dynamics are found to be important in theoretical, computational, and control applications. For example, the actual stability of a mathematically (or locally) stable steady state is highly correlated to the minimum perturbation requirements for a state transition. If two indicative parameters-the minimum perturbation time and the minimum perturbation magnitude-are small for the system to transit from one steady state to another, a mathematically stable steady state can be unstable in actual conditions, where stochastic disturbances exist as "strong perturbations". Further, building thermal mass is also found to have significant impacts on the state transitions between the multiple steady states. With thermal mass, the state transition becomes more difficult to occur. The state transition dynamics can also be applied to numerical simulations. (cont.) We have developed a convenient dynamical simulation method to identify the possible steady states in buildings with complex geometries and test the stabilities of the obtained steady states. The method can determine nearly all the possible steady state the system may reach in a feasible range using different search methods; whether the steady states obtained are stable in an actual environment can also be determined by a disturbance test based on the transition dynamics between the multiple steady states. Further, the state transition dynamics can be strategically applied in hybrid ventilation controls. In the past, designers and engineers have viewed the multiple steady states as negative aspect of ventilation design and have been trying to avoid the multiple steady states as much as possible. In this study, we have developed positive applications of multiple steady states based on a dynamic state transition in real-time to enhance the ventilation efficiency of a hybrid ventilation system and to reduce the energy usage in buildings. A coupled multi-zone airflow and thermal program for transient entire building simulations is also developed in parallel with the study. With the understanding on the multiple steady state issues, the developed program has overcome a few non-trivial numerical problems reported in other similar simulation programs and has shown good numerical performance in coupled airflow and thermal analysis. The program is also used as a tool for identifying the multiple steady states in buildings with complex geometries and for testing the actual stabilities of the obtained steady states in real conditions. by Jinchao Yuan.

40|$|Air {{filters are}} {{chosen for the}} minimum particle-capture {{efficiency}} they can provide in a specific application. Some media can achieve high efficiencies at low {{resistance to air flow}} by adding electrostatic charges on fairly coarse fibers. However, prolonged filter exposure to fine particles reduces the electrostatic enhancement effect. The filter efficiency must then rely mainly on mechanical collection mechanisms, and can fall well below the initial value. It is useful to test filter media when the effect of electrostatic charges is eliminated. To estimate the efficiency drop that may occur, air filter test standards include filter conditioning procedures to inhibit the effect of electrostatic charges. These treatments should leave only particle capture effects from mechanical collection mechanisms such as sieving, aerodynamics and diffusion, but not reduce or enhance these effects. EN 779 : 2012 and ISO 21220 : 2009 describe such a conditioning treatment for filter media, and ASHRAE 52. 2 - 2012 describes one for full-scale filters. The ASHRAE 52. 2 - 2012 optional treatment suggests that air filters be exposed to a potassium chloride aerosol having approximately 35 nm count mean diameter. Following the charge-elimination treatment, procedures measuring efficiency as a function particle size are performed. In ISO/TS 21220 : 2009 and EN 779 : 2012 the discharging treatment is also mandatory, but is performed on samples of the media used to manufacture the filter. This treatment requires a 2 minute soak in essentially pure isopropyl alcohol (IPA), after which the media samples are dried for 24 hours before further tests. This method presents problems, namely, that soaking in a liquid may alter the mechanical efficiency of media, and that samples of media may not be representative of the media used in the full-scale filter. A new approach, developed by T. Hayashi in Japan, eliminated electrostatic effects in electret-enhanced media sheets by exposure to IPA vapor for 16 hours or longer. This procedure was successfully duplicated by J. Cai in China, and at the Politecnico di Torino. ISO/TC 142 /WG 9 in 2010 ran an inter-laboratory comparison to assess this procedure, and in 2011 organized another comparison which extended the method to full-scale filters. The full-scale tests have included three different types of air filters, comparing the results with the other approaches previously mentioned. These results will be useful for revising the current ISO 29461 - 1 test method and also for developing the new ISO 16890 <b>series</b> for general <b>ventilation</b> applications.
