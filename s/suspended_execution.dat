50|$|The {{processor}} {{maintains a}} stack {{on which it}} places each frame {{that it has to}} suspend in order to handle a procedure call. If it is executing fib(2), and encounters a recursive call to fib(1), it will save fib(2) state, including its variables and where the code <b>suspended</b> <b>execution,</b> and put that state on the stack. It will not take a suspended state off the stack and resume execution until the procedure call that caused the suspension, and any procedures called in turn by that procedure, have all been fully executed.|$|E

Our model extends the current C [...] framework with new services. In particular, we suggest two extensions to the back-end runtime interface: a mechanism for saving the state of a <b>suspended</b> <b>execution</b> and a revised mechanism for resuming the state of a <b>suspended</b> <b>execution.</b> We demonstrate the plausibility of our model for the simplest case and conjecture on its extensibility to the general case...|$|E

30|$|The task {{scheduling}} problem in energy harvesting embedded systems was first proposed by Allavena and Mossé in [20], {{and then some}} algorithms for solving this problem were proposed. The lazy scheduling algorithm (LSA) proposed by Moser et al. [21] adjusts the worst-case execution time by adjusting frequency of the CPU according to tasks’ energy consumption. The LSA {{is based on a}} strong assumption that the worst-case execution time of a task is related with its energy consumption directly, and this assumption is impractical [22]. Chandarli et al. [23] proposed an ALAP scheduling algorithm, and it was a fixed-priority scheduling policy that delayed the executions of jobs as long as possible. Abdeddaïm et al. [24] proposed an ASAP algorithm, and this algorithm scheduled tasks as soon as possible when there was available energy in the battery and <b>suspended</b> <b>execution</b> to replenish the energy needed to execute one time unit. Under constraints of energy and time, ASAP is proved to be optimal.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is about study to the <b>suspended</b> death <b>execution</b> of narcotic convict in Indonesia (Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso’s Case). The kind of <b>suspended</b> death <b>execution</b> {{that happened to}} Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso {{is the first in}} Indonesia because it happened at the last minutes before the execution. The legal issues that raised are the reason of the <b>suspended</b> death <b>execution</b> that happened to Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso and the impact of it. The method of {{research is}} normative law research which is focused on norm of positive law in the form of supporting laws and regulations. The source of this research uses secondary data which consists of primary law, secondary law, and tertiary law. The result of this research are: there are two reasons of the <b>suspended</b> death <b>execution</b> of Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso that are juridical reason and political reason, and the impacts of the <b>suspended</b> death <b>execution</b> of Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso are social impact, law impact, and the impact to Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso herself. For recommendations, law enforcer should be more carefully when doing their duty and law maker is supposed to make a regulation about the term of <b>suspended</b> death <b>execution...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{suspending}} semantic {{model for}} {{the execution of the}} MONSTR generalised term graph rewriting language is defined. This is the canonical operational semantic {{model for the}} MONSTR language. Its correctness with respect to DACTL semantics is discussed, and a number of general theorems on the soundness of <b>suspending</b> <b>executions</b> with respect to DACTL semantics are proved. General theorems are proved about the independence of suspending primitive actions, which are useful in the verification of MONSTR systems...|$|R
5000|$|On January 1, 1938 {{the site}} of the {{execution}} chamber relocated to the newly built Georgia State Prison at Reidsville. From 1964 until 1976 the U.S. Supreme Court <b>suspended</b> <b>executions,</b> ruling that states' laws were insufficient. In 1974 the Supreme Court had outlawed executions and nullified original death penalty laws. The State of Georgia passed a rewritten death penalty law in 1973. In 1976 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Georgia death penalty was constitutional.|$|R

50|$|Modern {{languages}} after ALGOL such as PL/1 and C {{almost invariably}} use a stack, usually supported by most modern computer instruction sets {{to provide a}} fresh activation record for every execution of a subprogram. That way, the nested execution is free to modify its local variables without concern for the effect on other <b>suspended</b> <b>executions</b> in progress. As nested calls accumulate, a call stack structure is formed, consisting of one activation record for each suspended subprogram. In fact, this stack structure is virtually ubiquitous, and so activation records are commonly termed stack frames.|$|R
