30|$|Rice {{possesses}} a fibrous root system comprised of {{a mix of}} embryonic and post-embryonic roots with multiple branching orders (Rebouillat et al. 2009). Post-embryonic roots consist of nodal roots arising from each tiller and numerous lateral roots branching from these axes. There {{are two types of}} lateral roots in rice, small lateral roots and large lateral roots. Small lateral roots are shorter, more abundant, ageotropic and do not ramify, while large lateral roots are much longer, less abundant, geotropically positive and highly branched. Root length density in deeper soil layers is highly correlated with <b>soil</b> <b>exploration</b> and water uptake efficiency (Kamoshita et al. 2000; Siopongco et al. 2005). Since rice root architecture is characterized by relatively short nodal roots (shorter than maize or barley), the large lateral roots are likely to contribute substantially to deep <b>soil</b> <b>exploration.</b> Increased lateral root formation under drought stress was suggested as a potentially useful adaptation to drought in lowland rice (Morita et al. 2002; Henry et al. 2012).

40|$|An {{emerging}} {{paradigm is}} that root traits that reduce the metabolic costs of <b>soil</b> <b>exploration</b> improve {{the acquisition of}} limiting soil resources. Here we test the hypothesis that reduced lateral root branching density will improve drought tolerance in maize (Zea mays) by reducing the metabolic costs of <b>soil</b> <b>exploration,</b> permitting greater axial root elongation, greater rooting depth, and thereby greater water acquisition from drying soil. Maize recombinant inbred lines with contrasting lateral root number and length (FL: few but long; MS: many but short) were grown under water stress in greenhouse mesocosms, in field rainout shelters, and in a second field environment with natural drought. Under water stress in mesocosms, lines with the FL phenotype had substantially less lateral root respiration per unit axial root length, deeper rooting, greater leaf relative water content, greater stomatal conductance, and 50 % greater shoot biomass than lines with the MS phenotype. Under water stress in the two field sites, lines with the FL phenotype had deeper rooting, much lighter stem water δ 18 O signature signifying deeper water capture, 51 to 67 % greater shoot biomass at flowering, and 144 % greater yield than lines with the MS phenotype.

At this initial stage of the project the main objectives were: (1) to identify associations between chemical elements; (2) to estimate spatial patterns of variation for such associations in the surficial materials. The associations were established using principal component analysis (PCA). Variography was used to obtain the theoretical model of spatial continuity of each variable. These models were used in the interpolation method (kriging) selected to estimate surficial dispersion patterns. The results of PCA and PCA mapping indicate distinct distribution patterns for the metals related to the primary mineralogical or geochemical association, as identified for this deposit. Based on the results, six of the 53 chemical elements studied were selected to estimate spatial patterns of dispersion in the topsoil.

To do that a discrete analogue of pumice sand, a very crushable microporous granular material, is created.

The model has 6 material parameters that are calibrated using one oedometer test and analogies with similar geomaterials. The calibration is validated reproducing other element tests. To fill a calibration chamber capable of containing a realistic sized CPT the discrete analogue is up-scaled {{by a factor of}} 25. CPT is then performed at two different densities and three different confinement pressures. Cone tip resistance in the crushable material is practically insensitive to initial density, as had been observed in previous physical experiments.

30|$|Anatomical traits affect P {{efficiency}} via {{their effects}} on root metabolic cost, e.g. enhanced root cortical aerenchyma (RCA) formation reduces root respiration and the metabolic cost of <b>soil</b> <b>exploration</b> in maize subject to drought and low nitrogen (Zhu et al. 2010; Saengwilai et al. 2014). The functional-structural model SimRoot predicts that more RCA would improve P efficiency in maize, substantially improving growth and reducing critical P levels by 12  % (Postma and Lynch 2011). Despite the fact that rice has substantially greater RCA formation than maize, genotypic variation in rice RCA could affect metabolic cost by a similar mechanism. Increased specific root length, a phenomenon often observed under low nutrient treatments (Hill et al. 2006; Fernandez and Rubio 2015), is also predicted {{to reduce the cost}} of <b>soil</b> <b>exploration</b> (Chimungu and Lynch 2015). Changes in specific root length could be achieved by reduced secondary growth in dicots, or by various anatomical changes in monocots, such as fewer cortical cells or a smaller stele. Cortical cell file number, which is correlated with the number of cortical cells, has been shown to improve drought tolerance of maize by reducing root respiration, increasing rooting depth and thereby improving water capture (Chimungu et al. 2014). In rice, anatomical traits such as root diameter and xylem vessel size have previously been targeted for their potential to improve drought resistance (Clark et al. 2008; Henry et al. 2012), but could also contribute to root efficiency, i.e. P uptake per unit root size (Wissuwa 2005), under low P conditions.|$|E

We now need a second Green Revolution, to improve the yield of crops grown in infertile soils by farmers with little access to fertiliser, who represent the majority of third-world farmers. Just as the Green Revolution was based on crops responsive to high soil fertility, the second Green Revolution {{will be based on}} crops tolerant of low soil fertility. Substantial genetic variation in the productivity of crops in infertile soil has been known for over a century. In recent years we have developed {{a better understanding of the}} traits responsible for this variation. Root architecture is critically important by determining <b>soil</b> <b>exploration</b> and therefore nutrient acquisition. Architectural traits under genetic control include basal-root gravitropism, adventitious-root formation and lateral branching. Architectural traits that enhance topsoil foraging are important for acquisition of phosphorus from infertile soils. Genetic variation in the length and density of root hairs is important for the acquisition of immobile nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium. Genetic variation in root cortical aerenchyma formation and secondary development (‘root etiolation’) are important in reducing the metabolic costs of root growth and <b>soil</b> <b>exploration.</b> Genetic variation in rhizosphere modification through the efflux of protons, organic acids and enzymes is important for the mobilisation of nutrients such as phosphorus and transitionmetals, and the avoidance of aluminum toxicity.

30|$|Tropical rice genotypes {{within the}} Japonica varietal group have been {{described}} as having thick roots, while Japonica genotypes from temperate zones (group 6  T) had roots of intermediate thickness (Lafitte et al. 2001). When root diameter, measured as the total root cross-section area (RXSA), was compared across genotypes, we found that the Japonica genotypes had about 32  % greater average RXSA than the Indica genotypes (Additional file 3 : Table S 3), but that the two temperate japonica genotypes, Aichi Asahi and Nipponbare, had RXSA similar to Indica genotypes (Additional file 4 : Figure S 4). However, there was considerable variation among genotypes within groups and an overlapping distribution between groups. Plasticity of RXSA response to low P varied across genotypes, but most genotypes had thinner roots under low-P stress (Table  6). Reduction of root diameter in response to low P availability, a process termed “root etiolation”, has been suggested to reduce the metabolic cost of <b>soil</b> <b>exploration</b> (Lynch 2011). Consistent with this idea, low P mostly affected RXSA via its effects on the cortical area (TCA), by far the largest component of RXSA (Table  6) and therefore of root volume. All genotypes showed a reduction in TCA with low P, while stele area (TSA) showed variable responses to low P. The metabolic cost of <b>soil</b> <b>exploration</b> is predicted to decline under low P stress via reduction of the total area of the cortex and increasing aerenchyma formation (%AA), which combine to reduce the living cortical area (LCA) (Table  6). Reduced LCA due to greater aerenchyma formation has been shown to reduce specific root respiration in maize, permitting greater root elongation, better resource capture and greater yields under drought and nitrogen limitation in maize (Fan et al. 2003; Zhu et al. 2010; Jaramillo et al. 2013; Saengwilai et al. 2014; Chimungu et al. 2015).|$|E

Compared with RDI- 1, PRI- 1 increased irrigation depth and total soil water (theta(v)) availability in the root zone, and stimulated greater fine root growth and water uptake. Increased <b>soil</b> volume <b>exploration</b> supported greater canopy water use, vegetative development, biomass accumulation and internal water storage capacity. PRI- 1 vines had higher stomatal conductance, lower leaf-level water use efficiency and increased leaf xylem sap concentration ([X-ABA](leaf)) following reirrigation. Compared with RDI- 2, PRI- 2 decreased total theta(v) availability, fine root growth and water uptake, gas exchange, leaf water status, [X-ABA](leaf), biomass accumulation and storage capacity. Xylem ABA decreased with total theta(v) availability in PRI- 2, probably from limited sap flow when theta(v) in drying soil was low (approximate to 20 %). For this rootstock-scion combination, high irrigation volumes applied to the wet part of the roots (theta(v) > 30 %) are critical for increasing root-to-shoot ABA signalling and growth, and improving performance under semiarid conditions...|$|R
