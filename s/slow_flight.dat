500|$|Feathers on the alula or bastard wing are not {{generally}} considered to be flight feathers in the strict sense; though they are asymmetrical, they lack the length and stiffness of most true flight feathers. [...] However, alula feathers are definitely an aid to <b>slow</b> <b>flight.</b> [...] These feathers—which are attached to the bird's [...] "thumb" [...] and normally lie flush against the anterior edge of the wing—function {{in the same way as}} the slats on an airplane wing, allowing the wing to achieve a higher than normal angle of attack– and thus lift– without resulting in a stall. [...] By manipulating its thumb to create a gap between the alula and the rest of the wing, a bird can avoid stalling when flying at low speeds or landing.|$|E

500|$|The pale {{crag martin}} (Ptyonoprogne obsoleta) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the swallow family that is resident in northern Africa and in southwestern Asia east to Pakistan. It breeds mainly in the mountains, but also at lower altitudes, especially in rocky areas and around towns. Unlike most swallows, it is often found far from water. It is 12–13cm (4.7–5.1in) long, with mainly brown plumage, paler-toned on the upper breast and underwing coverts, and with white [...] "windows" [...] on the spread tail in flight. The sexes are similar in appearance, but juveniles have pale fringes to the upperparts and flight feathers. It was formerly {{considered to be the}} northern subspecies of the rock martin of southern Africa, although it is smaller, paler, and whiter-throated than that species. The pale crag martin hunts along cliff faces for flying insects using a <b>slow</b> <b>flight</b> with much gliding. Its call is a soft twitter.|$|E

A small, freely-moving {{projection}} on {{the anterior}} {{edge of the}} wing of modern birds (and a few non-avian dinosaurs)—a bird's [...] "thumb"—the word is Latin and means [...] "winglet"; it is the diminutive of ala, meaning [...] "wing". Alula typically bears three to five small , with the exact number depending on the species. They normally lie flush against the anterior edge of the wing, and function in similar manner to the slats of an airplane's wing, allowing the wing to achieve a higher than normal angle of attack, thus aiding in lift.

500|$|Dragonflies are {{powerful}} and agile fliers, capable of migrating across oceans, moving in any direction, and changing direction suddenly. In flight, the adult dragonfly can propel itself in six directions: upward, downward, forward, back, to left and to right. They have four {{different styles of}} flight: A number of flying modes are used that include counter-stroking, with forewings beating 180° out of phase with the hindwings, is used for hovering and <b>slow</b> <b>flight.</b> This style is efficient and generates {{a large amount of}} lift; phased-stroking, with the hindwings beating 90° ahead of the forewings, is used for fast flight. This style creates more thrust, but less lift than counter-stroking; synchronised-stroking, with forewings and hindwings beating together, is used when changing direction rapidly, as it maximises thrust; and gliding, with the wings held out, is used in three situations: free gliding, for a few seconds in between bursts of powered flight; gliding in the updraft at the crest of a hill, effectively hovering by falling at the same speed as the updraft; and in certain dragonflies such as darters, when [...] "in cop" [...] with a male, the female sometimes simply glides while the male pulls the pair along by beating his wings.|$|E

500|$|Michelson {{directed}} various efforts {{pertaining to}} future transportation. His team invented battery-state-of-charge estimation techniques, developed electric vehicle systems simulation tools, and experimented with actively blown surfaces on passenger vehicles. During the mid-1990s, Michelson's research {{began to focus}} almost entirely on unmanned vehicle systems, especially those {{with the power of}} flight. [...] He directed efforts with both U.S. Government agencies and private industry pertaining to unmanned aerial vehicles systems (UAS). [...] One of his first UAS development programs was for a traffic surveillance drone using a compound ducted fan design, made to fly over Atlanta's highways in order to fill surveillance gaps in the State's tower-mounted traffic camera system. [...] It also could be sent to traffic accident locations to gather and relay vital information in advance of first-responder arrival. Funding shortfalls resulted in the cancellation of the project before its maiden flight, but the design was later marketed for military use. [...] Michelson's focus turned to smaller vehicle systems that could fly indoors autonomously without the aid of global positioning system (GPS) reference signals. [...] Under various contracts to DARPA and the Air Force, and using internal research and development funds from the Georgia Tech Research Institute, his design team designed a micro air vehicle (MAV) known as the entomopter. [...] The NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts recognized the unique flight qualities of the entomopter and awarded Michelson two contracts to explore the feasibility of the entomopter for <b>slow</b> <b>flight</b> in Mars' lower atmosphere.|$|E

Over 45 {{different}} aircraft [...] have flown proving VTOL and STOL capabilities, of which the V-22, Harrier, Yak-38 and F-35 jets have proceeded to production. By 2008, Bell had estimated that very light jets and large offshore helicopters like the Sikorsky S-92 had reduced the potential market for tiltrotors. Also in 2008, {{it was reported that}} limited funding of the program by both Bell and AgustaWestland had resulted in <b>slow</b> <b>flight</b> testing progress.|$|E

50|$|High {{aspect ratio}} wings, which usually have low wing loading and are {{far longer than}} they are wide, are used for <b>slower</b> <b>flight.</b> This may {{take the form of}} almost {{hovering}} (as used by kestrels, terns and nightjars) or in soaring and gliding flight, particularly the dynamic soaring used by seabirds, which takes advantage of wind speed variation at different altitudes (wind shear) above ocean waves to provide lift. Low speed flight is also important for birds that plunge-dive for fish.|$|R
25|$|Woodcock migrate at night. They fly at low altitudes, {{individually}} or in small, loose flocks. Flight speeds of migrating birds have been clocked at 16 to 28 {{miles per hour}} (26 to 45kilometers per hour). However, the <b>slowest</b> <b>flight</b> speed ever recorded for a bird, 5 miles per hour (8 kilometers per hour), was recorded for this species. It is believed that woodcock orient visually using major physiographic features such as coastlines and broad river valleys. Both the autumn and spring migrations are leisurely compared with the swift, direct migrations of many passerine birds.|$|R
2500|$|Foot-launched {{aircraft}} {{had been}} flown by Lilienthal {{and at the}} meetings at Wasserkuppe in the 1920s. However the innovation that led to modern hang gliders was in 1951 when Francis Rogallo and Gertrude Rogallo applied for a patent for a fully flexible wing with a stiffening structure. [...] The American space agency NASA began testing in various flexible and semi-rigid configurations of this Rogallo wing in 1957 {{in order to use}} it as a recovery system for the Gemini space capsules. Charles Richards and Paul Bikle developed the concept producing a wing that was simple to build which was capable of <b>slow</b> <b>flight</b> and as gentle landing. Between 1960 and 1962 Barry Hill Palmer used this concept to make foot-launched hang gliders, followed in 1963 by Mike Burns who built a kite-hang glider called Skiplane. In 1963, John W. Dickenson began commercial production.|$|E

60|$|I {{remember}} {{a day when}} the breast of the hills was heaving in a last quick waking sigh, and the blue eyes of the waters opened bright. Across the infinite skies of March great rounded masses of cloud had sailed stately all day, domed with a white radiance, softened with faint, fleeting shadows as if companies of angels were gently sweeping past; adorned with resting, silken shadows like those of a full white breast. All day the clouds had moved on to their vast destination, and I had clung to the earth yearning and impatient. I took a brush and tried to paint them, then I raged at myself. I wished that in all the wild valley where cloud shadows were travelling like pilgrims, something would call me forth from my rooted loneliness. Through all the grandeur of the white and blue day, the poised cloud masses swung their <b>slow</b> <b>flight,</b> and left me unnoticed.|$|E
60|$|If, therefore, {{we accept}} it as highly {{probable}} (if not proved) that the Heliconidæ are very greatly protected from attack by their peculiar odour and taste, we find it much more easy to understand their chief characteristics--their great abundance, their <b>slow</b> <b>flight,</b> their gaudy colours, and the entire absence of protective tints on their under surfaces. This property places them somewhat {{in the position of}} those curious wingless birds of oceanic islands, the dodo, the apteryx, and the moas, which are with great reason supposed to have lost the power of flight on account of the absence of carnivorous quadrupeds. Our butterflies have been protected in a different way, but quite as effectually; and the result has been that as there has been nothing to escape from, there has been no weeding out of slow flyers, and as there has been nothing to hide from, there has been no extermination of the bright-coloured varieties, and no preservation of such as tended to assimilate with surrounding objects.|$|E

50|$|During World War II, German {{aircraft}} commonly fitted a {{more advanced}} version that pushed back flush against the wing by air pressure to reduce drag, popping out when the angle of attack increased during <b>slower</b> <b>flight.</b> Notable slats of that time belonged to the German Fieseler Fi 156 Storch. These were similar in design to retractable slats, but were fixed non-retractable slots. The slotted wing allowed this aircraft to take off into a light wind in less than 45 m (150 ft), and land in 18 m (60 ft). Aircraft designed by the Messerschmitt company employed automatic, spring-loaded leading-edge slats as a general rule, except for the Alexander Lippisch-designed Messerschmitt Me 163B Komet rocket fighter, which used fixed slots built integrally with, and just behind the wing panel's outer leading edges instead.|$|R
