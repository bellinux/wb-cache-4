25|$|When Maria Theresa of Austria {{became the}} queen of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1740, she promised to the nobles of the kingdom that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{residence}} both in Austria and in the Kingdom of Hungary– that is in Pressburg Castle. She kept the promise and spent much time in Bratislava. A corresponding conversion of the defense castle into a (at that time) modern royal residence was performed between 1761 and 1766.|$|E
25|$|Blankers-Koen {{was born}} Francina Elsje Koen on 26 April 1918 in Lage Vuursche (near Baarn) to Arnoldus and Helena Koen. Her {{father was a}} {{government}} official who competed in the shot put and discus. She had five brothers. As a teenager, she enjoyed tennis, swimming, gymnastics, ice skating, fencing and running. Standing , she was a natural athlete. It soon became clear she was a sports talent, {{but she could not}} decide which sport to pick. A swimming coach advised her to do track because there were already several top swimmers in the Netherlands at that time (such as Rie Mastenbroek), and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better chance to qualify for the Olympics in a track event.|$|E
25|$|In 1844 {{their mother}} took {{the girls to}} Paris to {{continue}} their studies, first with Francesco Piermarini, {{and then with the}} distinguished tenor Marco Bordogni. Bordogni thought highly of Sophie: it is said that he allowed her to sing only scales and solfeggi which he composed for her, for two whole years. After that time mother Crüwell wanted to remove her, saying that she had learnt scales enough and that {{if she was going to}} do nothing else she might as well get married and give it up. Bordogni persuaded mother that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wonderful career, and that she should go on to complete her studies in Milan. A first public appearance in January 1846 was reported in the musical journal Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris.|$|E

She was almost {{satisfied}} that he should go alone. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> hour with Luke, if he came early, and it was necessary {{that she should have}} him to herself, before too many people had shouted evil and good news, congratulations, opprobrium, and suspicions at him.|$|R
25|$|Tomari is very {{athletic}} and competitive, so {{in high school}} she joined the track and field club. In contrast to Hazumu and Yasuna who are not athletes and rather feminine, Tomari is a tomboy who does not often partake in traditionally feminine things such as clothing, shopping, or cosmetics. In her entire life, Tomari never wore a yukata during the annual summer festival, and has to borrow on old one from her mother when she finally does wear one during the summer festival shortly after Hazumu's transformation. At least two of Tomari's female friends on the track team consider her very masculine, and like her cool character; one of these friends even says that if Tomari were a boy that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> huge crush on her. Unlike Yasuna, Tomari {{has a lot of}} difficulty when it comes to her affection towards Hazumu, but still ends up with her.|$|E
25|$|In 1773, {{at the age}} of 20, Phillis {{accompanied}} Nathaniel Wheatley to London in {{part for}} her health, but also because Susanna believed <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better chance publishing her book of poems there. She had an audience with the Lord Mayor of London (an audience with George III was arranged, but Phillis returned home beforehand), as well as with other significant members of British society. Unfortunately, she was never able to personally meet Selina Hastings, the Countess of Huntingdon, who served as the patron of Wheatley's volume of poems, which was published in the summer of 1773. In 1774, Phillis Wheatley wrote a letter to Reverend Samson Occom, commending him on his ideas and beliefs of how the slaves should be given their natural born rights in America. Wheatley also exchanged letters with the British philanthropist John Thornton, who in turn discussed Wheatley and her poetry in his correspondence with John Newton. Along with her poetry, she was able to express her thoughts, comments and concerns to others.|$|E
25|$|Responding to {{the success}} of Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and their rival Deutschland, a sister to the former was ordered. Named in honour of Crown Prince Wilhelm, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> varied career. Her transatlantic maiden voyage on 17 September 1901 was from Bremerhaven, via Southampton and Cherbourg, to New York City. In 1902, she transported Prince Henry of Prussia to America and was also visited by her namesake. In September the same year, she won the Blue Riband, as her sister had done in 1898. This, however, was quickly taken by Deutschland. From 1914 she was an {{auxiliary}} cruiser for the Imperial German Navy, sailing as a commerce raider for a year. Highly successful in this role, when the United States entered the war, she was seized in April 1917 and served as a Navy troop transport until 1919. Renamed USS Von Steuben (ID-3017) at capture, she was decommissioned and turned over to the United States Shipping Board, where she remained in service until she was scrapped in 1923.|$|E

In the Bible, {{he is one of the}} three patriarchs of the Israelites, the only one whose name was not changed, and the only one who did not move out of Canaan. According to the narrative, he died when he was 180years old, the longest-lived of the three.|$|E
500|$|Although Milian was a {{songwriter}} since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, [...] "there are no rules". Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, where <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a [...] "no rules theory", which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, [...] "It was just, you know what? I can change up the melody I can do different things. Sometimes I might get stuck but wait {{half an hour}} and it'll {{come to you and}} end up being hot. So that's probably my biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new. Once I got past all that, it was just easy. With flying colors, I started writing all the records." ...|$|E

500|$|During the season, the {{producers}} worked with Glenn Hetrick of Optic Nerve Studios {{to help create}} Raina's Inhuman look, and introduce the Inhumans to the MCU. To get to the final look, the writers {{spent a lot of}} time discussing what her transformed look would entail, such as if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> nose, or a tail, with series writer Drew Greenberg eventually suggesting thorns. With the design idea in hand, Hetrick and his team began compiling potential designs for the character, looking to the Clive Barker film Nightbreed, specifically the character Shuna Sassi, because [...] "She's a creature covered in porcupine quills and that image is so strong — it creates such a striking silhouette". Since Hetrick and his team did not have source material to pull from in the comics, he wanted to [...] "make her feel like the first real Inhuman" [...] and give her face a level of symmetry. When creating the prosthetic makeup, which was done in two weeks, {{the producers}} wanted to still be able to see Negga's eyes, with Bell saying, [...] "Ruth Negga has amazingly expressive eyes and eyebrows. And she gets so much of who Raina is through the eyes. We wanted her to still be able to communicate, we still wanted you to feel her expressions through all of [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Like her 2000 studio album, Music, Madonna {{enlisted the}} help of French DJ and {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Always interested in adapting herself and her music to the contemporary compositions, Madonna was inspired by the new Massive Attack and Lemon Jelly albums. [...] "We set out to put the two worlds of acoustic and electronic music together," [...] said Madonna. [...] "It is another step on, but I've never wanted to repeat myself. I don't ever want to repeat myself or make the same record twice." [...] American Life became Madonna's final studio album with Maverick Records, and marked the end of an eleven-year recording history with the label. In an interview with VH1 titled Madonna Speaks, the singer discussed her 20 years in the music industry, and revealed her motivations behind American Life, about [...] "material things" [...] being unimportant. [...] "I have lots of 'material' things and I've had lots of beliefs about things and what's important, and I look back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that {{a lot of things that}} I'd valued weren't important", she concluded. Discussing her thoughts on the conception of the album, she told Q magazine that through her 20 years of being in the entertainment industry, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> correct opinion on fame and fortune and its perils, which would be the base of the album.|$|E

2500|$|Zina {{was about}} seven months {{pregnant}} with a Jacobs's child (Zebulon William Jacobs), as confirmed by DNA evidence, when she married Smith. It is not clear when Jacobs was {{made aware of the}} wedding to Smith, however, he believed in Smith's prophetic counsel. Zina and Henry Jacobs continued to live together as man and wife, and Zina's [...] "connubial relations with Joseph Smith, if any occurred at all, [...] certainly infrequent and irregular." [...] She never had any children with Joseph, but she and Jacobs had another son, Henry Chariton Jacobs, on March 22, 1846. Her husband Henry was constantly called on missions (he served at least eight between 1839 and 1845) and was thus often absent from the house. In the face of such absences, Zina did not turn to Joseph but rather sought relief from female kin. Her marriage to Henry, riddled with absences as it was, was the only time in her life that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> full-time husband. Though many 19th and early 20th century Mormon biographers painted her marriage to Henry as [...] "not proving a happy union" [...] to justify her subsequent marriages to Smith and later to Brigham Young, evidence from her diaries suggests this assertion is unfounded.|$|E
