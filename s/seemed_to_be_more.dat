25|$|What {{was perhaps}} most {{significant}} for the LXX, as distinct from other Greek versions, was that the LXX began to lose Jewish sanction after differences between it and contemporary Hebrew scriptures were discovered (see Disputes over canonicity). Even Greek-speaking Jews tended less to the LXX, preferring other Jewish versions in Greek, {{such as that of}} the 2nd-century Aquila translation, which <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> concordant with contemporary Hebrew texts.|$|E
25|$|After {{her three}} miscarriages, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> and more {{unlikely}} that the queen would bear an heir. Royal advisors urged the monarch to seek a divorce, hoping that the new wife would be Protestant and fertile – but Charles refused. This eventually led to her being made a target by courtiers. Throughout his reign, Charles firmly dismissed the idea of divorcing Catherine, and she remained faithful to Charles throughout their marriage.|$|E
25|$|At Thanbyuzayat, {{other groups}} of prisoners would {{gradually}} {{be brought into the}} camp, and these would come under Varley's jurisdiction such that he was eventually responsible for 9,000 men in total. To manage A Force, he had a small headquarters, with departments responsible for food, medical care and so forth. During his time in Burma, Varley constantly agitated to improve conditions as much as possible for the men under his command. He also tried to keep as many men as possible working. This meant that a possibly more cordial relationship existed with the Japanese at Thanbyuzayat than elsewhere, to the benefit of the welfare of the men under his charge. The Japanese commander also <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> lenient than other commandants in charge of prison camps in the region.|$|E

25|$|For the myogoenic fishes, {{this change}} in signal {{waveform}} occurs with the initial larval electrocytes fusing together forming new electrocytes with different shapes, along with redistribution of ion-gated channels, formation of new extracellular structures on the electrocytes, etc. Some pulse fishes also develop accessory electric organs located on {{other parts of the}} body; these extra electric organs further play a role in adding phases to the EODs. For the only neurogenic fish known so far, apteronotids, EOD changes during the developmental process <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> dramatic than that of the myogenic fishes, which might indicate that neurogenic electrocytes are more easily prone to modifications. Similar with the myogenic fishes, apteronotids has its electric organ formed by myocytes. As apteronotids matures, new neurogenic electrocytes derived from spinal motoneurons replace the myogenic electrocytes.|$|E
25|$|On January 8, 1863, Governor Leland Stanford ceremoniously broke {{ground in}} Sacramento, California, to begin {{construction}} of the Central Pacific Railroad. After great initial progress along the Sacramento Valley, construction was slowed, first by {{the foothills of the}} Sierra Nevada, then by cutting a railroad bed up the mountains themselves. As they progressed higher in the mountains, winter snowstorms and a shortage of reliable labor compounded the problems. Consequently, after a trial crew of Chinese workers was hired and found to work successfully, the Central Pacific expanded its efforts to hire more emigrant laborers—mostly Chinese. Emigrants from poverty stricken regions of China, many of which suffered from the strife of the Taiping Rebellion, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> willing to tolerate the living and working conditions on the railroad construction, and progress on the railroad continued. The increasing necessity for tunneling as they proceeded up the mountains then began to slow progress of the line yet again.|$|E

Although one of the poorer major network ratings of the night, it constituted a slight increase over the previous week's episode, [...] "The Stakeout". The episode received a 1.9 rating/5 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49. The episode received generally positive reviews, with several commentators claiming the season continued a trend of funnier episodes than in the first season. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the show <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> confident. He praised the silliness of Andy, the deadpan humor of April and [...] "the sweetness of Leslie realizing how much she likes Dave the cop".|$|E

He believed that the snow had [...] "all but stopped" [...] and was more concerned about the amount of vehicular traffic, such as sweepers and ploughs, than he was about the snowfall. The second officer of Trump Shuttle Flight 1541, which had landed around the time Flight 405 was taxiing, said their Boeing 727 had [...] "picked up a lot of snow quickly during my post-landing walkaround, but by the finish it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> rain." [...] He described Flight 405 as a [...] "fairly clean airplane." [...] He said that he could not comment on clear ice, but that the wings and fuselage were clear of snow.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{lover of}} Russian fantasy and horror, Bava decided to adapt Nikolai Gogol's 1835 horror story [...] "Viy" [...] into a feature film. However, the {{resultant}} screenplay (by Bava, Ennio De Concini and Mario Serandrei) in fact owed very little to Gogol at all, and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> {{a tribute to the}} atmospheric black-and-white gothic horror films of the 1930s, especially those produced by Universal Studios.|$|E

This newfound attention to Laysan attracted scientists, and in the next decade, many of Laysan's unique species were scientifically examined for the first time.

2500|$|When Rockefeller {{made his}} second {{run in the}} 1966 election, only 11 percent of Arkansans {{considered}} themselves Republicans.

[...] Democrats themselves <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> interested in the reforms that Rockefeller offered in his campaign than [...] "winning another one for the party." [...] An odd coalition of Republicans and Democratic reform voters catapulted Rockefeller into the governor's office, as he defeated a segregationist Democratic former Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court, James D.

2500|$|As Davis {{left office}} in 2003, the San Francisco Chronicle {{published}} an editorial discussing his legacy.

The Chronicle commented that Davis was often {{on the right side}} of the issues but that being {{on the right side of}} the issues alienated the electorate. Davis lacked charisma and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> passionate about winning campaigns than governing. Davis never showed emotion to the voters.

2500|$|Dennison {{controlled}} Omaha politics {{throughout his}} reign. His approval {{to run for}} office was gained through payment of bribes and by supporting the rest of Dennison’s political slate. In 1906, Omaha Republicans supporting the Progressive Movement nominated a reformer named Erastus Benson for Mayor, and Dennison was afraid that Benson would come out in favor of prohibition. Omaha Democrats nominated James C. [...] "Cowboy Jim" [...] Dahlman, a popular, first-time candidate. Dahlman <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> tolerant of [...] Dennison's [...] "Sporting District", so Dennison supported him. Dahlman was elected mayor that year, and in eight out of nine subsequent campaigns for mayor between 1906 and 1930; Dahlman's losing the election in 1918 was part of the background to racial violence in Omaha.|$|E
2500|$|The {{period from}} the late 1880s was one of steady and inexorable decline. Gradually it became too {{difficult}} for him to travel to Europe. He suffered a complete collapse on his final tour, which included Beauvais, Sallanches and Venice, in 1888. The emergence and dominance of the Aesthetic movement and Impressionism distanced Ruskin from the modern art world, his ideas on the social utility of art contrasting with the [...] "l'art pour l'art" [...] or [...] "art for art's sake" [...] that was beginning to dominate. His later writings were increasingly seen as irrelevant, especially as he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> interested in book illustrators such as Kate Greenaway than in modern art. He also attacked Darwinian theory with increasing violence, although he knew and respected Darwin personally.|$|E
