40|$|Watermarking {{consists}} of hiding of information within a multimedia element {{such as an}} image, a text, music or a video clip. Hiding information within other information is called steganography. A TV station's logo may serve as an example for perceptible information. <b>Steganographical</b> methods are needed to integrate non-perceptible information: that means this information is hidden within a multimedia element like an image...|$|E
40|$|Textual labels {{overlaid}} {{on medical}} images provide significant information {{which should be}} unavailable to un-authorized persons {{who have access to}} the image. This paper proposes “image steganography ” as a means to hide this valuable information inside the image without losing it. Conventional template matching is used to find the text on the image and extract it, the text is subsequently removed from the image and In the next step, a <b>steganographical</b> method is proposed by the authors to embed the text into the image, so that the textual data will be present in the image but visually undetectable. In the proposed <b>steganographical</b> scheme, the data is embedded into the mean value of a number of pixels. But since any degradation in medical images could reduce the clinical value of the image, keeping the image alterations to a negligible amount becomes of great concern, thus the maximum modification on each pixel is limited by the algorithm. Implementation of this algorithm on many medical images shows that a reasonable amount of data can be embedded into an image without perceptible alterations besides having a satisfying robustness against noise...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{literature}} on information security has to consider innovative and continuously developing ways of protecting data from infiltration {{taking into consideration}} {{the speed of the}} processors and the cryptanalysis. New <b>steganographical</b> technologies have been created to provide security with or without data encryption including data hiding. Etymologically, the term ‘steganography’, which means ‘covered writing’, originates from the Greek words “stegos” (cover), and “grafia ” (writing). Steganography operates to conceal a secret message rooted in various forms of media including image, video, audio, and text. The domain of information hiding utilizes several algorithms. The easiest and widely known technique is Least Significant Bit (LSB). This paper compares and analyses Least Significant Bit algorithm using the cover object as an image with a focus on two types: BMP and JPEG. The comparison and analysis are done with respect to a number of criteria to understand their strengths and weaknesses...|$|E
40|$|Information {{interchange}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} processes in human everyday life. This process was simplified due to development of modern technologies, especially computer technologies. But the drawback of such transmission is data exposure. Steganography tries to find possible decisions of this problem. The main difference between steganography and cryptography: malicious person has no any data about information hiding in first case. That’s mean he doesn’t think about possible valuable information in message. This paper contains information about the conception of digital steganography’s development as protection method of the confidential information. Classification of the basic scopes is given, and the problems facing to the given science are explained. Some aspects of steganography were examined in the context of the theory of signal transmission. The properties of possible universal stegomethod’s constructor are determined on the basis of required transmission’s reliability. The way, which increases the probability of a bit correct detecting in Kutter method till 70 %, is offered as improvement of data embedding procedure. Disadvantages of the original <b>steganographical</b> Kutter method’s were commented at the same time. Results of experiments are presented as numerous histograms...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} pixel value differencing (PVD) <b>steganographical</b> schemes {{are easily}} detected by pixel difference histogram (PDH) analysis. This {{problem could be}} addressed by adding two tricks: (i) utilizing horizontal, vertical, and diagonal edges and (ii) using adaptive quantization ranges. This paper presents an adaptive PVD technique using 6 -pixel blocks. There are two variants. The proposed adaptive PVD for 2 × 3 -pixel blocks is known as variant 1, and the proposed adaptive PVD for 3 × 2 -pixel blocks is known as variant 2. For every block in variant 1, the four corner pixels are used to hide data bits using the middle column pixels for detecting the horizontal and diagonal edges. Similarly, for every block in variant 2, the four corner pixels are used to hide data bits using the middle row pixels for detecting the vertical and diagonal edges. The quantization ranges are adaptive and are calculated using the correlation of the two middle column/row pixels with the four corner pixels. The technique performs better {{as compared to the}} existing adaptive PVD techniques by possessing higher hiding capacity and lesser distortion. Furthermore, it has been proven that the PDH steganalysis and RS steganalysis cannot detect this proposed technique...|$|E
40|$|Steganography is {{the science}} and art of covert {{communications}} and involves two procedures. First, the required message is concealed in a particular carrier, e. g. image, audio, text, etc., that is called a steganographic cover. The second procedure is concerned with transmitting the cover to the message recipient without drawing suspicion. Fundamentally, the steganographic {{goal is not to}} hinder the adversary from decoding a hidden message, but to prevent an adversary from suspecting the existence of covert communications. When using any steganographic technique if suspicion is raised, the goal of steganography is defeated {{regardless of whether or not}} a plaintext is revealed. Contemporary steganography approaches camouflage data as noise in a cover that is assumed to look innocent. For example, the encoded message can be embedded as alteration of digital images, audio files, text, etc., without noticeable degradation. However, such alteration of authenticated covers can raise suspicion and makes the message detectable. Another example is when linguistics, e. g., using synonymous words, is exploited as a means to conceal a message, causing the presence of abnormal and sometimes weird sentences in a text that become discernable by human and machine examinations. The presence of such unjustifiable noise draws attention and unravels the hidden communications. This dissertation introduces a novel Noiseless Steganography Paradigm (Nostega). Nostega neither hides data in a noise nor produces noise. Instead, it camouflages messages in a form of unquestionable data in the generated cover. In addition, steganography approaches found in the literature have focused on how to conceal a message and not on how to camouflage its transmittal. Nostega addresses such shortcoming by not only camouflaging a message but also its transmission. Thus, Nostega is a novel paradigm in steganography research. In Nostega, the <b>steganographical</b> goal is achieved by determining a suitable domain that is capable of generating an unsuspicious steganographic cover in which a message intrinsically is embedded in a form of innocent data that is compatible with the chosen domain. In addition, Nostega establishes a covert channel by employing the selected domain to serve as a justification for the interaction and delivering the cover among the communicating parties. A number of Nostega- based methodologies are presented. The first methodology, a novel cover type, namely graph- cover, is introduced. Unlike image, audio, and text based steganographic covers, graphs enable data hiding in a plotted graph. Graph covers fit very well with Nostega and are suitable for many domains. The second methodology pursues popular games such as chess, checkers, crosswords, domino, etc., to conceal messages. Meanwhile, the third methodology pursues the linguistics path to generate text- cover. It exploits educational documents as steganographic covers by manipulating mainly, but not limited to, questions and answers. This methodology can employ exam generators and text substitution techniques to automate the process of cover generation. Finally, the fourth methodology is also a linguistic steganography type that conceals messages by manipulating automatic summarization techniques to conceal data in textual summaries. Implementation and steganalysis validation of these methodologies are presented...|$|E
