In 1976, it merged with the Philippine Bank of Commerce and Merchants Banking Corporation, creating then the largest branch network. The 1980s was a very significant decade in the bank; in 1982 it officially decided to adopt the history of the Philippine Bank of Commerce, resulting it to get the distinction of being the first Filipino-owned private commercial bank in the country, and it established its ExpressPadala Center in Ermita and it pioneered the remittance business in the country. Then in 1983, it decided to change the [...] "I" [...] in PCIBank from Industrial to International, to reflect the wide foreign office network of the bank. In 1985, it merged with the Insular Bank of Asia and America. In 1987, John Gokongwei bought shares in the bank, becoming the second largest stockholder he appointed Rafael Buenaventura to head PCIBank as President and CEO. Adding sparkle to PCI Bank’s history are the string of the [...] "Bank of the Year" [...] awards from the editors of Euromoney and Asiamoney. The Bank has also been cited for its export financing, specialized lending and consumer finance activities by the Philippine Export and Foreign Loan Guarantee Corporation, the Development Bank of the Philippines, and the Home Insurance and Guaranty Corporation. Addressing the various needs of its customers, PCI Bank set up subsidiaries to provide services ranging from leasing, investment banking and <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>transactions</b> to credit cards, consumer loans, insurance, and overseas remittances. Also in the 1980s proved hard for the Lopezes because all of their businesses were seized by President Marcos. To this day The Romualdez-Lopez Dispute case still remains at court. Also in the 1980s when Gokongwei entered PCIBank he also owned Far East Bank and Trust Co and talks of a merger surfaced which would have created the largest bank in the Philippines. In 1991, PCIBank formed BancNet along with Security Bank, Chinabank, RCBC, Allied Bank (merged with PNB), Metrobank, International Corporate Bank (now part of UnionBank) and Citytrust Savings Bank. BancNet was also the brainchild of one of PCIBank's senior officers Mr. Ramon Arceo, Jr., the Senior Vice President.

Herding often arises and is particularly pervasive on some days. The proportion of herd buyers (sellers) is 2 percent (4 percent) and is greater than 10 percent in 7 percent (11 percent) of information-event days.

40|$|Three essays {{comprise}} this dissertation. The first essay uses panel data to {{show that}} labor income risk alone cannot explain limited <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> participation. However, <b>transaction</b> costs and household demographics, considered jointly, can determine both the discrete choice of whether to hold stock and the amount held, conditional on whether the household is already investing in the <b>stock</b> <b>market.</b> <b>Transaction</b> costs are proxied by state-level number of brokers per capita. The second essay builds on the first essay. I measure two different covariance terms. One is between self-evaluated house value and uninsurable labor income risk. The other is between housing investment return and stock return. The results show that homeownership has a diversification effect on stock holdings. This effect occurs because adding a house to the household portfolio can significantly decrease the overall risk of the portfolio. The last essay empirically shows that unemployment is significant in determining both consumer bankruptcy filings and delinquency even after controlling for household demographics. Furthermore, I show that unemployment and the debt/wealth ratio also affect the choice of whether to file for bankruptcy under chapter 7 or chapter 13, after controlling for demographics.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an extensive empirical {{investigation into the}} sources of index return autocorrelation, focusing on the relation between autocorrelation in individual stock returns and autocorrelation in index returns. The study uses daily data from the Stockholm Stock Exchange over the period 1980 - 1995 and reports three main empirical findings. Daily Swedish stock index returns exhibit strong, and consistently positive, first order autocorrelation throughout the sample period. Positive autocorrelation is observed for return frequencies between 1 day and 3 months. The most liquid stocks exhibit strong positive return autocorrelation. Less liquid stocks exhibit weak or negative return autocorrelation. Autocorrelation is asymmetric, high after days of above average performance of the <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> low after days of below average performance. When {{compared to the other}} days of the week, both index returns and individual stock returns exhibit the strongest autocorrelation following on Friday returns. The transaction cost hypothesis was tested using the Swedish <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>transaction</b> tax. Results indicate lower precision of stock prices during the transaction tax period, but no direct effect on return autocorrelation. The paper concludes that at least three sources contribute to observed return autocorrelation. For daily and short-term returns, profit taking and nonsynchronous trading are the probable causes of observed autocorrelation. For monthly and longer term returns, time-varying expected returns best describe the empirical results.

40|$|Market Trends and Trading in Options versus Stocks PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Although {{there is}} a lot of {{evidence}} on impact of market states on investors’ behavior, the majority of studies in the area concentrates on equity markets, while options have received very limited attention. This thesis aims to partially fill this gap. The topic is of particular importance given the recent fast growth of derivatives markets. In this study, I theoretically and empirically address the question of how do past equity returns affect trading in options compared to stocks. I investigate both informed and uninformed trade. To the best of my knowledge, this thesis is the first academic study on the subject. DATA The sample consists of Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) traded individual stock options associated with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) traded equity and covers the period from January 1996 to September 2008. The data includes option <b>market’s</b> <b>transactions,</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market’s</b> <b>transactions,</b> and analysts’ forecasts. Option market data is obtained from the OptionMetrics, which is currently the most comprehensive publically available options trading database. <b>Stock</b> <b>market</b> data comes from The Center for Research in Security Prices database (CRSP). Analysts’ forecasts were extracted from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S database (IBES). RESULTS I develop a theoretical model predicting that both trading volume in options versus <b>stocks</b> and option <b>market’s</b> price informativeness increase following <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> gains. In the model, I incorporate the overconfidence mechanism of Gervais and Odean (2001) into the trading framework by Admati and Pfleiderer (1988). Uninformed (liquidity) investors on aggregate hold long positions in equity and, due to a self-attribution bias, become more (over) confident following bull markets. Overconfident liquidity investors prefer to trade in options underestimating risks of leverage and attracted by higher returns it provides. Increased liquidity reduces trading costs and consequently brings more informed traders to option market, which improves its price informativeness. I also find empirical evidence in support of my theory. In particular, by regressing option-tostock trading ratios on past market returns and controls, I document an increase in option trading volume relatively to stock trading volume following bull markets. The effect is also present in cross-section as there is relatively more trading in options versus stocks for companies which shares had been on their way up. Additionally, by regressing <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> returns on past options’ volatility skews and controls, I find that option <b>market</b> predicts <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> better after equity market gains, suggesting increased informed trading.

[...] <b>Transaction</b> costs are particularly applicable to [...] "momentum strategies"; {{a comprehensive}} 1996 review of the data and studies concluded that even small transaction costs would lead to an inability to capture any excess from such strategies.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} the Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) adopts a linear {{extrapolation}} method {{to set the}} settlement price for the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) options with less liquidity and thin trading. The empirical {{results indicate that the}} settlement-price-determined implied volatility is a smile function, consistent with the pattern of the market-price-determined implied volatility. Moreover, we examine the influence of economic factors on the TAIFEX's decision regarding the parameters of implied volatility function. Compared with the economic determinants of market-force-driven volatility parameters, the TAIFEX inappropriately values the impacts of the parameters of prior days, current stock returns, distribution of stock returns, long-term measurement of the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> trend, <b>market</b> <b>transaction</b> cost, and time to maturity.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact of outward foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) on economic growth. Design/methodology/approach – Two econometric approaches are used: cross-country regressions for a sample of 50 countries and time-series estimators for the USA. Findings – Both approaches tell the same story: outward FDI is positively associated with growth. This finding is robust to several model specifications, potential outliers, and different estimation techniques. In addition, Granger-causality tests for the USA indicate that causality is bidirectional, suggesting that increased outward FDI is both a cause and a consequence of increased domestic output. Originality/value – Previous studies have primarily examined the firm- and industry-level effects of outward FDI – for example, on domestic investment, employment, and productivity. This paper, in contrast, deals with the effects of aggregate outward FDI on the economy as a whole. Arbitrage, Dividends, <b>Stock</b> <b>markets,</b> Taxes, <b>Transaction</b> costs...|$|R
