Shooting was {{accomplished}} on location over a span of two months, from September to November 2005. Locations featured included the Singapore Zoo, the Gateway building, and the Singapore National Library. Another major filming location was Robinson Road, where heavy rains caused production delays. The Singapore police were on location to block roads and protect the filming equipment, such as when the film's action scenes required two 250-foot high industrial cranes. Author Audrey Yue noted that the film shoot benefited Singapore by leading to domestic and Indian film-induced tourism.|$|E

40|$|Extract]In this {{dissertation}} we {{have studied}} the origins of deadweight loss in employment <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes.</b> The disagreement between micro and macroeconometric studies of the added value of such schemes in guiding long-term unemployed back to the labour market has been {{the reason for this}} research. Microeconometric studies find positive treatment effects for participating long-term unemployed. That is, their re-employment probability improves as compared to similar non-participating long-term unemployed. Consequently, micro studies are positive about employment <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes.</b> Macroeconometric studies – unlike micro studies – take the overall employment effect of employment <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> into account and find that employment <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> hardly lead to additional employment. As a consequence, such studies are more conservative with respect to the role employment <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> should play in reducing long-term unemployment. Deadweight loss – the share of long-term unemployed the firm would have hired {{in the absence of the}} subsidy – is one of the main and most harmful impediments to extending employment as a consequence of introducing the subsidy. In case of deadweight loss, the microeconomic effect (i. e. productivity gain) cannot be attributed to the subsidy, as the employee in question would also have found the job without that subsidy. The same holds for the macro effect (i. e. extending the effective labour supply). In case of deadweight loss, firms would have considered subsidized employees even without the subsidy, which implies they are already part of the effective labour supply. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{voluntary}} {{provision of}} public goods can be boosted by subsidies paid to contributors. This paper compares {{the performance of}} two types of <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> in a threshold public game: an unconditional subsidy paid to each contributor proportionally to his contribution; and a conditional subsidy paid to each contributor only if the public good threshold is attained. Our experimental results show that <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> are not only effective but also efficient to improve the provision of threshold public goods. In addition, introducing a conditional payment improves {{the efficiency of the}} mechanism and in some cases improves its effectiveness, despite identical game-theoretic predictions. By drawing an analogy between agri-environmental contracts and <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> in threshold public goods, these results suggest that the performance of environmental contracts (such as agri-environmental schemes) could be improved in the case of threshold effects of pollution on the environment by introducing a collective conditionality on contract payments...|$|R

We show how this environment can lead to an economy where females earn less and drop out more frequently than equally skilled males in equilibrium, even when males and females constitute ex-ante identical populations. We then examine how different government homecare <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> may affect such gender inequality in the labor market. We show that the effect of government homecare <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> on gender inequality depends crucially on the form in which the subsidy is given and to whom it is allocated.

40|$|Danish {{farmers have}} been far less {{interested}} in agri-environmental <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> (AES) than anticipated. In order to examine how to improve the appeal of such schemes, a choice experiment was conducted concerning 444 Danish farmers' preferences for <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> for pesticide-free buffer zones. A random parameter logit framework was used to capture heterogeneity among farmers. Our results indicate that 1) {{the vast majority of}} farmers are willing to trade off the size of the subsidy for less restrictive scheme requirements and that 2) the amount of the subsidy they are willing to trade off varies with specific scheme requirements, suggesting which features are most important for successful policy design. Our results suggest that farmers value flexible contract terms higher than reduced administrative burdens. Finally, we suggest a practical approach to estimating a monetary value of farmers' reluctance to participate in AES. While the trade off's that farmers are willing to make between subsidy size and individual scheme requirements are case specific, our results concerning increased use of farm advisors, farmers ability of valuing different types of flexibility, and our attempt to place a monetary value on farmers' reluctance to engage in regulatory <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> have a potentially broader application platform.

40|$|The {{development}} and diffusion of clean technologies {{has an important}} role to play in preventing pollution. Government must address the issue of how firms can be given the necessary incentive to develop environmentally sound production techniques and products. This paper focus on how subsidies can — under certain restrictive conditions — stimulate innovation. Subsidization is usually assumed to involve unit subsidies for pollution reduction. Unit subsidies {{have little to do with}} the <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> in actual use. Our focus is on <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> specifically designed to promote the development of clean technologies through the use of grants/financial aid. Based on data from the development projects initiated through The Danish Clean Technology Programme we analyze how environmental innovations take place when the polluters, their suppliers and consultants are actively engaged in the development processes. The main merit of <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> like the Danish one is its direct focus on the innovation processes and the active incorporation of the network of firms surrounding the polluters. Our findings lead us to conclude that when it comes to subsidization, the role of government should be redefined. Government can act as a “matchmaker” by providing firms with informative incentives and necessary contacts for finding more efficient technological solutions to specific environmental problems.

The overall fiscal deficit shrank by more than 4 percentage points of GDP during the last four years, bringing the budget close to balance in 2007. However, the overall deficit is projected to widen to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2008, driven by the upward surge in the fiscal cost of Morocco's universal <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> following the sharp increase in world commodity and oil prices.|$|E
25|$|The subsidy {{stratification}} {{system in}} Colombia has proven fairly ineffective at channeling subsidies towards the poor. Although the scheme is broad in its coverage and excludes {{no more than}} 2 percent of the poor for services with broad coverage such as electricity, water and sanitation, there are also high leakage rates. Some 50-60 percent of subsidy beneficiaries are from {{the top half of}} the income distribution and, moreover, only 30-35 percent of subsidy resources are captured by the poor. Nevertheless, the performance of this <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> varies depending on the service considered, being water the sector with the poorest performance and telephony the one with the best behavior.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} redistributive role of {{the housing}} subsidies has got a relatively little attention in the literature. However, non-linear housing <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> are commonly used by many countries. We consider {{the question of the}} optimal tax treatment of housing in a model where agents di¤er in two dimensions; ability and the housing price they face. The problem is also solved numerically. In addition to a general four-type model, we also considered two extensions: endogenously determined housing prices and paternalistic government. The key lesson from the paper is that when individuals differ also in access to housing, the housing <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> have a redistributive role and they are non-linear. A justification for subsidizing or taxing housing holds also without introducing any merit good argument to the analysis; in the optimal tax model where agents di¤er in their abilities and access to housing it is optimal to tax and subsidize housing, even with separable preferences...|$|R
25|$|The Direct <b>Subsidy</b> <b>Scheme</b> (DSS) is instituted by the Education Bureau of Hong Kong as a {{means to}} enhance the quality of private schools in Hong Kong at the primary and {{secondary}} levels. The Hong Kong government has been encouraging non-government secondary schools which have attained a sufficiently high educational standard to join the DSS by providing subsidies to enhance the quality of private school education since the 1991–92 school year. In the 2000–01 school year, the DSS is extended to primary schools. In the 2001–02 school year, the terms of the DSS were significantly improved to attract more schools to join the scheme. Under the scheme, schools are free to decide on their curriculum, fees and entrance requirements.|$|E
25|$|The Blackout Reduction Program (PRA) was {{established}} {{by the government in}} 2001. Initially designed to last two years, it has been subsequently extended {{in the absence of an}} alternative way to deal with the issues it addresses. This program has the objective of targeting subsidies to the poor on a geographical basis and implementing rolling blackouts in a more organized fashion. The poorest neighborhoods in the cities were to have a provision of about 20 hours of electricity per day at a price highly subsidized by the government and the utility. The PRA was initially considered a success. However, the country's macroeconomic crisis, the perverse incentives built into the PRA, and the deficiently targeted <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> have jeopardized the medium-term sustainability of the program. The absence of demand management, the lack of metering systems, sustained losses, a culture of non-payment and the absence of incentives for the distribution companies to fix the technical problems make it urgent to design a new subsidy and rationing system that is part of a more comprehensive approach to solve the problems of the power sector.|$|E

This paper presents a detailed examination of the impact of two types of <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> [...] mortgage interest rate write-downs, both universal and income-targeted, and income-targeted down-payment subsidies [...] on the housing purchase capacity and the potential demand for mortgage loan volume in two very diverse markets: Budapest and Moscow. An accounting model that performs detailed calculations at the household level using information on household resources (income, savings and home equity), mortgage terms and conditions, and housing costs (unit prices plus an assortment of closing costs) was developed for the analysis. The down-payment subsidy is found to be better in both markets at stimulating housing purchase capacity in terms of efficiency and the distribution of subsidies in favour of moderate-income families.

40|$|Pricing policy {{recommendations}} infrastructure services {{are based on}} two principles. One is that prices should cover {{the total cost of}} the service. The other is that cross <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> should be avoided. This technical paper explores the economic literature for rules on applying these principles to real world infrastructure services. The discussion is based on a partial equilibrium approach that uses market surplus as a proxy for social welfare and efficiency. Three main conclusions are reached in this paper. First, if a uniform price schedule is established and prices diverge from marginal cost, then social welfare can be increased by establishing appropriate price discrimination schemes that have cross subsidies. Second, from a voluntary sustainability standpoint, some cross <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> are not suitable, whereas others are appropriate. Third, sometimes, optimal and voluntary sustainable price schedules are not compatible. In these cases, a trade-off between optimality and sustainability is often necessary.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{development}} and political legitimation of economical subsidies to the Danish press, based on document analysis of bills, political negotiations, and reports from various committees, commissions, and working groups from the 1960 s until present. The study maps out the different <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> of the period, their descriptions of purpose, and the political discussions relating to the subject. Also the change of demands and expectations of the aided newspapers, as well as the changing perceptions of the press, are discussed. This analysis shows that the development of Danish media subsidies was characterised by a tension between conflicting political views on media regulation. The <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> were therefore conceived as both cultural and business politics. As a result, the purposes of the subsidies appeared ambiguous, and the schemes were indirect and general, as opposed to the more direct and selective media subsidies in Norway and Sweden. However, during the last decade the Danish <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> have been amended, resembling the other Scandinavian models, and last year the first actual ‘law on media subsidy’ was passed. The fear of state regulation seems to have decreased, and the goals of the media subsidies have become more apparent in the legislation. In conclusion the thesis states that media subsidies over the studied period have become an institutionalized part of Danish media politics. The development points towards a more democratic corporatist approach to media politics, and the thesis suggests that media subsidies {{can be seen as a}} political ‘brake pad’, limiting the process of convergence towards the more liberal media systems...|$|R

We develop a lobbying model where farmers trade bribes for favorable policies; a key element of this model is the ability of farmers to tilt the terms of the bargaining game with policy makers in their favor by pre-committing to an inefficient choice of semi-fixed inputs. Government corruption and its willingness to provide subsidies cause farmers to adopt inefficient modes of production as a mechanism to capture such subsidies. Our predictions are consistent with stylized facts on land use in Latin America, and suggest that <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> have been counterproductive- distorting and constraining development, and triggering excessive depletion of natural resources. We validate some of the predictions of the model through econometric analyses using a new data set for nine countries in Latin America.
