5000|$|Crankshafts {{manufactured}} for the 1999 {{model year}} (to {{the end of}} 4.3L production) had a pilot hole depth of 1.410" [...] when coupled to the LSx-based 4L60E, which had a redesigned torque converter pilot hub which is longer and used with a 300mm <b>stator</b> <b>shaft).</b> The torque converter pilot hub is longer than the early 4L60E (similar in appearance to the 700R4 c. 1993-95) or the second generation variants (incorporating a removable bellhousing) with the GMT330 or 1996-2000 C/K series.|$|E
50|$|Commonly, {{torque sensors}} or torque {{transducers}} use strain gauges {{applied to a}} rotating shaft or axle. With this method, a means to power the strain gauge bridge is necessary, {{as well as a}} means to receive the signal from the rotating shaft. This can be accomplished using slip rings, wireless telemetry, or rotary transformers. Newer types of torque transducers add conditioning electronics and an A/D converter to the rotating <b>shaft.</b> <b>Stator</b> electronics then read the digital signals and convert those signals to a high-level analog output signal, such as +/-10VDC.|$|R
30|$|From the IF components, {{marginal}} spectral and HHS distribution (Figure 4 b-d), the rotor-stator contact phenomenon can be found, {{although there}} exist some trivial interferences components (e.g., the embraced part by red dash line in Figure 4 b), {{introduced by the}} EMD procedure. The higher frequencies are excited by contact rubbing. Accumulated energy distribution of these higher frequencies can be observed from the marginal spectral in Figure 4 c. These higher frequencies disappear once the rotor loses the contact with the <b>stator.</b> With <b>shaft</b> rotation, approximately periodical occurrences of the rub can roughly be observed from Figure 4 b, d. However, it can clearly be noted that there exist considerable mismatches on both time and period of rub occurrences between the IF (Figure 4 b) and the HHS (Figure 4 d), due to the inherent drawbacks in EMD. Thus, it is apparently impossible to determine the precisely equal ranges of rub occurrence T 1, T 2, T 3, and T 4, which may make some later procedures, such as feature extraction from the time-frequency data, difficult.|$|R
50|$|On a {{practical}} level, synchros resemble motors, {{in that there}} is a rotor, <b>stator,</b> and a <b>shaft.</b> Ordinarily, slip rings and brushes connect the rotor to external power. A synchro transmitter's shaft is rotated by the mechanism that sends information, while the synchro receiver's shaft rotates a dial, or operates a light mechanical load. Single and three-phase units are common in use, and will follow the other's rotation when connected properly. One transmitter can turn several receivers; if torque is a factor, the transmitter must be physically larger to source the additional current. In a motion picture interlock system, a large motor-driven distributor can drive as many as 20 machines, sound dubbers, footage counters, and projectors.|$|R

The oscillator is a mechanism that moves the fan from side to side. The armature shaft comes out {{on both ends of}} the motor, one end of the shaft is attached to the blade and the other is attached to the oscillator gearbox. The motor case joins to the gearbox to contain the rotor and <b>stator.</b> The oscillator <b>shaft</b> combines to the weighted base and the gearbox. A motor housing covers the oscillator mechanism. The blade guard joins to the motor case for safety.|$|R
40|$|In Adjustable Speed Drives (ASDs) for {{industrial}} and traction applications the {{pulse width modulation}} (PWM) inverters may produce a shaft voltage due to the capacitive couplings between the windings and the rotor and between the rotor and the <b>stator.</b> Such <b>shaft</b> voltage may be so intense to generate breakdown of the lubricating film in the motor bearings and the associated impulsive currents damage the bearing elements thus affecting the overall ASD reliability. In order to analyze these phenomena and carry out appropriate system design, suitable numerical models are needed which accurately {{take into account the}} effects of electromagnetic wave propagation and reflection and the frequency-dependent distributed losses in the system. For this purpose, by means of a model based on a lossy multiconductor transmission lines (MTLs) approach previously developed, the prediction of the voltages and currents at critical sections of a full stator winding (of the wound type) of a three phase high power traction motor is carried out. The MTL model is studied in the time-domain by using the telegraphers' equation system with suitable boundary conditions. The phase voltage at the input terminals of the motor and the voltage across the two bearings are calculated. Moreover, the simulated input voltages are shown to be in good agreement with those obtained by measurements on a real traction drive. Â© 2014 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} to detect the presence of broken bars in the rotor of a squirrel cage induction motor (SCIM). A mathematical model of the SCIM capturing both the healthy and faulty operating conditions of the motor is introduced, and a model-based FDI observer, based on second order sliding modes (2 -SMs), is presented. Appropriate theoretical arguments are invoked {{to demonstrate that the}} suggested FDI observer is capable of detecting the occurrence of the Broken Bar Fault (BBF) condition by relying on <b>stator</b> current and <b>shaft</b> speed measurements, which can be easily achieved in practice. Additionally, the proposed observer provides an exponentially convergent estimation of the rotor fluxes and of the the external load torque. The proposed scheme has been experimentally tested by means of a commercial Siemens 1. 1 -kW three-phase SCIM. The experimental results confirm the robust performance featured by the suggested methodology...|$|R

A rotor rotates coaxially around the stator, and a cycloidal reducer has an output that rotates at a reduced rate. The reducer output is rotationally fixed to, and is disposed within, the drum shell. An input gear of the reducer received a hollow eccentric input shaft, and is urged into eccentric motion as the input shaft rotates. The output gear urges the drum shell into rotation at same rate of rotation as the output gear. An harmonic drive speed reducer that has an input shaft provides rotatory motion to a wave generator that is disposed against a flexible splined member.

40|$|A high-thrust screw-type {{piezoelectric}} ultrasonic motor with a three-wavelength exciting mode {{is proposed}} in this paper. The motor mainly includes a stator and a screw output <b>shaft,</b> and the <b>stator</b> {{is composed of}} twelve rectangular piezoelectric plates and a hollow metal elastomer with an internal thread. The stator can be excited to generate the combined micro ultrasonic vibration mode. With this ultrasonic vibration mode, a three-wavelength traveling wave can be synthesized. The three-wavelength traveling wave is used to drive the screw output shaft {{by means of the}} frictional force between the <b>stator</b> and the <b>shaft.</b> Rotary-linear motion can be achieved without any additional conversion mechanism. Large thrust output can be easily obtained using a three-wavelength exciting mode. The exciting mode is analyzed in detail. The prototype is designed, simulated, and fabricated.

40|$|The use of {{switching}} devices, such as IGBTs, characterised by high switching {{frequencies and}} very low switching times in new generation {{pulse width modulation}} (PWM) inverters has increased the efficiency and performances of Adjustable Speed Drives (ASDs) for industrial and traction applications. However, such systems may be affected by disadvantages like over voltages at the motor terminals, when long cables are used between the drive, and the generation of rotor shaft voltage, due to the capacitive couplings in the motor (between the windings and the rotor and between the rotor and the <b>stator).</b> The <b>shaft</b> voltage may cause {{the breakdown of the}} lubricating film in the bearings. The resulting impulsive currents, by damaging the bearing elements shorten the component life, which in turn seriously affects the ASD reliability. For this reason, it is of great importance to develop numerical models able to predict the shaft voltage so as to estimate the currents flowing through the bearings. Several works, based on either concentrated or distributed circuit models, have been proposed for the evaluation of the shaft voltage magnitudes for several motors sizes. However, the results obtained by such approaches suffer from approximations and simplifications in the considered circuit model. Therefore, in the present paper, a numerical model able to accurately predict the shaft voltage in high power induction motor for traction applications fed by a PWM inverter is presented. The windings of the motor are modelled by a multi conductor transmission line (MTL), whereas the cables between the source and the motor are described by a single transmission line. The effect of wave propagation and reflection and of the frequency-dependent distributed losses is considered by using a time-domain equivalent circuit to represent the MTL. A semi-analytical method, based on the perturbation theory of the spectrum of symmetric matrices, is adopted. The parameters of the MTL are obtained either analytically or numerically by using a commercial software (MaxwellÂ® by Ansoft). The effects of the rise time of the input voltage together with the length of the cables are considered...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] A {{traditional}} {{method for}} transferring data in rotating mechanisms {{has been the}} slip ring, {{but these are not}} viable inside pistons due to size, the associated cabling, and the requirement of one slip ring per parameter. A mechatronic data acquisition system is developed whereby signal conditioning is performed by the sensor and the signal passed to a Bluetooth transmitter module for wireless telemetry to a Bluetooth receiver located in very close proximity, connected to an external host PC. The Data Acquisition (DAQ) Bluetooth module integrates a microcontroller that reads the conditioned thermocouple signal and performs any other DAQ functionality required. The microcontroller firmware includes a server that collates all DAQ data for transmission via Bluetooth to the host PC for display via a client interface. This Short Distance Telemetry (SDT) system is a substitute for slip rings and their associated cabling. A slip ring also transfers power, but this cannot be achieved with the SDT system, therefore an independent power supply is required. The power supply consists of a rotor incorporating NdFeB magnets and a wire wound <b>stator.</b> As the <b>shaft</b> rotates the rotor induces an AC voltage into the stator. A rectifying circuit converts the AC voltage into a regulated DC output voltage that drives the signal conditioning and embedded Bluetooth circuits...|$|R
40|$|Wired sensor {{systems are}} {{currently}} {{used to monitor}} the performance and health of electric motors. Since the sensors need to be wired, these systems can only use few sensor modalities which are generally insufficient to detect {{the wide range of}} faults in motors. Wireless sensors, on the other hand, allow access to sensors mounted in accessible locations and on rotating parts. They are easy to install and maintain. However, the reliability of the transmission due to electromagnetic interference and the fidelity of the data due to high winding temperatures inside the motor need to be examined. This paper studies the feasibility of wireless sensors inside a 200 hp AC induction motor. Two wireless sensors are attached inside the motor- one on the stator frame and one on the rotating shaft. A wired sensor is attached {{on the outside of the}} stator frame to study the fidelity of data from the wireless sensor. The packet delivery performance as a function of spatial location in terms of direction and distance with respect to the base station and the fidelity of data received by the base station are studied. The results show that an average of 97 % and 87. 9 % of the data from the wireless sensor attached on the <b>stator</b> frame and <b>shaft</b> respectively is received at the base station, thus showing that wireless sensors can be reliably used inside the motor. 1...|$|R

The applied voltage and current waveforms are generally quite non-sinusoidal and polluted with higher time harmonic components. The higher time harmonics affect the electrical and mechanical performance significantly, and adverse effects are investigated. Literature {{on the effect of}} higher time harmonics is reviewed. Recommendations referring to various aspects under non-sinusoidal excitation are made when installing inverter-fed induction motors. Different inverter supplies (6 -Pulse Square Wave voltage source inverter (VSI), PWM VSI and sinusoidal excitation) are used with a small 3 -Phase, 3 -kW squirrel cage induction motor, configured under synchronous characteristic Váµ£/ 50 and subsynchronous characteristic Váµ£/ 87. The respective voltage and current frequency spectrums of the excitation source are analyzed and the harmonic content determined.

40|$|INTEGRAL COMPRESSOR / GENERATOR / FAN UNITARY STRUCTURE. *) Dr. Nelik Dreiman Consultant, P. O. Box 144, Tipton, MI E-mail: ndreiman@frontier. com An {{extremely}} compact, therefore {{space saving}} single compressor/generator/cooling fan structure of short axial length and light weight {{has been developed}} to provide generation of electrical power with simultaneous operation of the compressor when power is unavailable or function as a regular AC compressor powered by a power line. The generators and air conditioning or mobile refrigeration compressors are designed and used at present as independent units (portable or automatic standby generator and a compressor of a condenser unit; car generator and AC compressor; generator driven by auxiliary engine and compressor of a trailer refrigeration unit, etc.). Such design makes it necessary to provide {{a considerable amount of}} material, installation space for every independent unit and requires separate mounting, wiring andÃ maintenance The present paper contemplates single unit serving as both a compressor and a generator to overcome the disadvantages related to utilization of independent multi-units specified above. The unitary compressor/generator structure is developed by radial integration of a revolving piston rotary compressor with an external rotor electric motor which can function as a motor or as an output generator. The integrally formed revolving piston compressor can be selectively driven by either the compressor electric motor powered by a line supply or by the external driver means when a source of electrical power is unavailable. The compressor driven by the external driver means pumps refrigerant and simultaneously produce electric power for utility by employing the generating mode of the compressors electric motor. Novel revolving piston rotary compressor which provides possibility for such integration comprises the following: a suction gas delivery system which provides cooling of the electric motor / generator and supplies refrigerant into the suction chamber under higher pressure (supercharged); a modified discharge system and lubricating oil supply system. Axial passages formed in the stationary crankshaft are used to supply discharge gas to a condenser, to return vaporized cooling agent from the evaporator to the suction cavity of the compressor, to pass a lubricant and to accommodate wiring for an electric power supply and transmission. An impeller wheel attached externally and spaced concentrically to the spinning piston is utilized to cool the compressor and direct the air over a condenser. The unitary C/G structure employs single electric motor to run the compressor, to generate electric power and to operate the airflow fan. The developed compressor/generator structure eliminates plurality of electric motors, related wiring, and control elements, reduce weight and cost due to exclusion of secondary <b>stators,</b> rotors, <b>shafts</b> and bearings, mounting and fence arrangements. The structure also minimizes the installation space. Ã *) Patent pending...|$|R
