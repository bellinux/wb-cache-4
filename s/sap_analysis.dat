40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Acid {{gastro-oesophageal}} reflux {{is one of}} the most important causes of chronic cough. The response to acid suppression in these patients is not as good as in patients with heartburn but improvement with antireflux surgery has been reported, suggesting the involvement of a non-acidic gastric component in the refluxate. Less acidic reflux may produce symptoms such as regurgitation or chest pain. We investigated whether chronic cough might be associated with weakly acidic reflux. METHODS: We studied 28 patients with chronic cough using 24 hour ambulatory pressure-pH-impedance monitoring. Manometry was used for precise recognition of cough and impedance-pHmetry to detect acid (pH /= 7) reflux. A symptom association probability (<b>SAP)</b> <b>analysis</b> was performed for each type of reflux. RESULTS: Analysis was completed in 22 patients with 24 cough events (5 - 92) /patient. The majority of cough events (69. 4 %) were considered "independent" of reflux whereas 30. 6 % occurred within two minutes of a reflux episode. Half of these (49 %) were "reflux cough" sequences, involving acid (65 %), weakly acidic (29 %), and weakly alkaline (6 %) reflux. Ten patients (45 %) had a positive SAP between reflux and cough: five with acid, two with acid and weakly acidic, and three only with weakly acidic reflux. CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory pressure-pH-impedance monitoring with <b>SAP</b> <b>analysis</b> allowed precise determination of the temporal association between cough and {{gastro-oesophageal reflux}} (acid, weakly acidic, and weakly alkaline) and identification of a subgroup of patients with chronic cough clearly associated with weakly acidic gastro-oesophageal reflux. status: publishe...|$|E

In pathogenic fungi, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways regulate dimorphism, biofilm/mat formation, and virulence.

40|$|The poor {{response}} of some plant species, e. g. wheat, to ammonium nutrition has {{been attributed to}} a diversion of carbon allocation from structural material for root extension to functions associated with the assimilation and translocation of ammonium in the root. The aim of this research was to investigate carbon allocation in response to ammonium or nitrate nutrition in wheat, an ammonium intolerant species, and maize, which exhibits ammonium tolerance. Experiments were carried out at 4 mM and 12 mM nitrogen feeding levels in sand and hydroponic culture respectively. pH of growth media was maintained at 6. 0 to 6. 5. Measurements made included shoot : root ratios, photosynthetic and root respiratory rates, plant water content, xylem <b>sap</b> <b>analysis,</b> and ¹⁴C and ¹⁵N allocation to soluble and bound nitrogen compounds, and soluble, storage and structural carbohydrates. Stunted root growth occurred in ammonium-fed wheat, which was exacerbated by increasing the NH 4 concentration. No difference in growth response was evident between ammonium- and nitrate-fed maize. Photosynthetic rates of ammonium- and nitrate-fed plants within both species were similar but maize showed a 3 -fold higher photosynthetic rate than wheat. Root respiration of ammonium- and nitrate-fed wheat was similar, while nitrate-fed maize appeared to have a higher root respiratory rate than ammonium-fed maize. Xylem <b>sap</b> <b>analysis</b> showed that for both species, ammonium-fed plants translocated more amino compounds and more carbon to the shoots than nitrate-fed plants, although maize appeared to have a more rapid translocation-rate than wheat. ¹⁴C allocation to nitrogenous compounds in roots of ammonium-fed plants was greater than that in nitrate-fed counterparts for both species. In wheat this increase appeared to be accommodated by a larger initial diversion of ¹⁴C to the root. In maize, reserve carbon in the root appeared to accommodate this increase. A reduction in ¹⁴C allocation to structural material in ammonium-fed plants compared to nitrate-fed counterparts was not evident in either species. ¹⁵N tracing in maize showed that significantly more nitrogen was taken up by ammonium-fed plants in comparison to nitrate-fed plants. The difference in total N between plants fed ammonium or nitrate was, however, not nearly as pronounced, suggesting that ammonium may be cycled out of the plant again.

Examination of an individual signal may fail to provide sufficient information to identify all instances of damage. Upon comparative evaluation {{of the performance of}} forward and inverse inferences for damage identification, a data fusion scheme was developed for predicting multi-damage in a structure {{with the aid of a}} sensor network. The approach, conducted hierarchically by activating different sensors in a sensor network, fused an extracted signal feature, time-of-flight (ToF), at different levels, to provide an overall consensus as to all possible instances of damage. This consensus was presented in an intuitional contour map indicating the probability of damage occurrence. Benefiting from the sensor network, the dependence of identification processes on a specific sensor was minimized, and the need for interpreting complex signal scattering by multi-damage was avoided as much as possible.

Este experimento foi conduzido com o objetivo de avaliar a concentração de nutrientes na seiva de duas variedades de laranja, quando fornecidas cinco doses de N, P 2 O 5 e K 2 O via fertirrigação. A seiva foi extraída mensalmente do ramo da brotação nova com éter etílico, durante duas safras consecutivas. Para compreender a dinâmica dos nutrientes na seiva, também foram feitas, simultaneamente, análises de folha e de solução do solo. Os valores de pH na seiva mantiveram-se constantes, em torno de 5, 5, independentemente dos tratamentos. A análise da seiva mostrou-se sensível às variações da adubação, pois as concentrações de N e K na seiva aumentaram {{conforme}} as doses de nutrientes aplicadas e correlacionaram-se de forma positiva com os valores desses nutrientes na folha e na solução do solo.

The sap was monthly extracted from stems of new shoots with ethyl ether during two consecutive growth seasons.

Xylem sap was also collected {{for a period of}} one hour beginning half an hour before each harvest and continuing for half an hour after harvesting. Separate batches of plants were used for harvesting and sap collection. In nitrate-fed plants the shoot was shown to be the main organ of nitrate assimilation. Xylem <b>sap</b> <b>analysis</b> indicated that 66 % of the ¹⁵N supply to the shoot was in the form of nitrate and the majority of the absorbed and assimilated ¹⁵N was located in this region. In ammonium-fed plants, however, ¹⁵N-ammonium accumulated in the root with only a very small amount detectable in the xylem sap. Some 93 % of the ¹⁵N exported from root to shoot in the xylem stream was in the form of organic nitrogen (mainly glutamine). This indicated that the root was the major organ of ammonium assimilation and that the shoot was the main destination of root assimilated nitrogen...|$|E
40|$|The {{roles of}} two cytosolic maize {{glutamine}} synthetase isoenzymes (GS 1), {{products of the}} Gln 1 - 3 and Gln 1 - 4 genes, were investigated by examining the impact of knockout mutations on kernel yield. In the gln 1 - 3 and gln 1 - 4 single mutants and the gln 1 - 3 gln 1 - 4 double mutant, GS mRNA expression was impaired, resulting in reduced GS 1 protein and activity. The gln 1 - 4 phenotype displayed reduced kernel size and gln 1 - 3 reduced kernel number, with both phenotypes displayed in gln 1 - 3 gln 1 - 4. However, at maturity, shoot biomass production was not modified in either the single mutants or double mutants, suggesting a specific impact on grain production in both mutants. Asn increased in {{the leaves of the}} mutants during grain filling, indicating that it probably accumulates to circumvent ammonium buildup resulting from lower GS 1 activity. Phloem <b>sap</b> <b>analysis</b> revealed that unlike Gln, Asn is not efficiently transported to developing kernels, apparently causing reduced kernel production. When Gln 1 - 3 was overexpressed constitutively in leaves, kernel number increased by 30 %, providing further evidence that GS 1 - 3 {{plays a major role in}} kernel yield. Cytoimmunochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed that GS 1 - 3 is present in mesophyll cells, whereas GS 1 - 4 is specifically localized in the bundle sheath cells. The two GS 1 isoenzymes play nonredundant roles with respect to their tissue-specific localization...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that site-specific nitrogen (N) fertilizer recommendations based on an assessment of a soil’s N supply (mineral N testing) and the crop’s N status (<b>sap</b> nitrate <b>analysis)</b> can help to decrease excessive N inputs for winter wheat on the North China Plain. However, the costs to derive such recommendations based on multiple sampling of a single field hamper the use of this approach at the on-farm level. In this study low-altitude aerial true-color photographs were used {{to examine the relationship between}} image-derived reflectance values and soil–plant data in an on-station experiment. Treatments comprised a conventional N treatment (typical farmers’ practice), an optimum N treatment (N application based on soil–plant testing) and six treatments without N (one to six cropping seasons without any N fertilizer input). Normalized intensities of the red, green and blue color bands on the photographs were highly correlated with total N concentrations, SPAD readings and stem sap nitrate of winter wheat. The results indicate the potential of aerial photography to determine in combination with on site soil–plant testing the optimum N fertilizer rate for larger fields and to thereby decrease the costs for N need assessments...|$|R
40|$|This Sampling and <b>Analysis</b> (<b>SAP)</b> {{presents}} the project requirements for proposed soil sampling {{to support the}} White Oak Creek Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. During the Data Quality Objectives process for the project, {{it was determined that}} limited surface soils sampling is need to supplement the historical environmental characterization database. The primary driver for the additional sampling is the need to identify potential human health and ecological risks at various sites that have not yet proceeded through a remedial investigation. These sites include Waste Area Grouping (WAG) 3, WAG 4, WAG 7, and WAG 9. WAG 4 efforts are limited to nonradiological characterization since recent seep characterization activities at the WAG have defined the radiological problem there...|$|R
40|$|To {{extend the}} {{usefulness}} of the Michigan Structural Analysis Program (MSAP), a computer graphics program called MSAPLOT has been developed. Using MSAP input data it plots line, plane and 3 -D objects in isometric form as well as their orthotropic projection. MSAPLOT allows the user of MSAP to accomplish the following: (1) Check visually on the screen the correctness of the input data of the model being studied. (2) View the deformed structure. (3) Produce an ink drawing through the CalComp plotter. (4) Draw pictures of any object following input format of MSAP. Note that MSAPLOT is equally applicable to all input data of SOLID SAP and to most of <b>SAP</b> IV. Static <b>analysis</b> mode and cartesian coordinates are needed for the latter...|$|R
