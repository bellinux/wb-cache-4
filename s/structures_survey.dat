The estimates are computed using data from three sources: the Wage <b>Structure</b> <b>Survey</b> (ESS), the Workforce Movement Questionnaire (DMMO), and the Occupational <b>Structure</b> <b>Survey</b> (ESE). We show that the estimated costs are generally asymmetric (hiring is cheaper than terminations), increasing, and concave functions of the number of entries or exits (either retirements or terminations). There is a fixed component to each of these costs that is related to the structure of the firm's personnel department. Our estimates imply that firms should not adjust gradually to the desired level of employment. ...|$|R

Data on wages are obtained through the annual survey on employment and wages among firms and partly through administrative data on the insured workers. This means that all information on wages comes from administrative sources (firms or administrative data on insured people). This dataset also contains information on gender, age and job characteristics. Data on education are obtained from the annual labour force survey and are matched with the wage data. This matched data-set is called the Wage <b>Structure</b> <b>Survey.</b> We obtained data from the surveys of 1995, 1996, 1997 and 2002.

The interior of the house features several rooms arranged around a central hallway and staircase; the rooms are decorated with oak trim, and the doors are topped with oak grilles.

The cast iron gates were likely built in 1865, the year the {{cemetery}} opened and the one emblazoned on the gates, though records of their construction have been lost. While cast iron was commonly used for building facades at the time, the gates are a rare example of its use in landscape architecture. The gates have a Serlian design with a wide central road entry and narrower pedestrian gates on either side; square columns separate the gates. An arch bearing the cemetery's name rises above the center entrance, while lintels span the side entrances; both the arch and the lintels feature ornamental designs.

50|$|The Winchester Historic District is a {{historic}} district which encompasses much of the developed area of Winchester, Illinois. The district includes 438 buildings, of which 273 are contributing buildings. Winchester's historic area represents a typical small, rural county seat; its commercial development is focused around the county courthouse and town square, while low- to moderate-density residential development can be found away from the commercial center. Development in the district began in the 1830s; by the 1870s, most of the significant buildings had been completed. The district's older buildings are mainly designed in the Federal and Greek Revival styles, while its later buildings mostly have Italianate designs. The Greek Revival Presbyterian Church stands out among these traditionally-styled buildings; according to the Illinois Historic <b>Structures</b> <b>Survey,</b> {{it is the most}} exceptional Greek Revival church in any Illinois city of over 500 people The Scott County Courthouse, a late addition to the district in 1885, has also been noted as architecturally significant, though its design does not conform to a single style.|$|E
5000|$|Schumm {{is known}} for his {{research}} on the putative adverse effects of LGBT parenting, and the state of Florida called on him to give expert testimony in support of their same-sex marriage ban when it was challenged in court in 2008. For example, in 2010, he published a study claiming that LGBT parents are more likely than non-LGBT parents to have LGBT children. In November 2012, he wrote a commentary in defense of the methodology of Mark Regnerus' New Family Structures Study (NFSS), which was originally published earlier that year and which claimed that children of same-sex parents were less likely to succeed later in life. Writing in the same journal (Social Science Research) that originally published the NFSS, Schumm claimed that â€œthe methodological decisions he Regnerus made in the design and implementation of the New Family <b>Structures</b> <b>Survey</b> were not uncommon among social scientists, including many progressive, gay and lesbian scholars."

Enterprises {{that do not have}} complete information for each year from 2003 to 2006 were dropped from the computations. The sample is limited to firms from West Germany. There are large differences between enterprises from West Germany and the former communist East Germany even many years after the unification in 1990. Therefore, an empirical study should be performed separately for both parts of Germany. The KombiFiD Agreement Sample for East German manufacturing firms, however, contains {{only a small number of}} firms, and this sample turned out to be not representative for the population of firms in a replication study that compares results based on the complete cost <b>structure</b> <b>survey</b> data and data from the KombiFiD Agreement Sample (see Wagner 2012).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe network {{architecture}} {{of the human brain}} has become a feature of increasing interest to the neuroscientific community, largely because of its potential to illuminate human cognition, its variation over development and aging, and its alteration in disease or injury. Traditional tools and approaches to study this architecture have largely focused on single scalesâ€”of topology, time, and space. Expanding beyond this narrow view, we focus this review on pertinent questions and novel methodological advances for the multi-scale brain. We separate our exposition into content related to multi-scale topological structure, multi-scale temporal structure, and multi-scale spatial structure. In each case, we recount empirical evidence for such <b>structures,</b> <b>survey</b> network-based methodological approaches to reveal these structures, and outline current frontiers and open questions. Although predominantly peppered with examples from human neuroimaging, we hope that this account will offer an accessible guide to any neuroscientist aiming to measure, characterize, and understand the full richness of the brain's multiscale network structureâ€”irrespective of species, imaging modality, or spatial resolution...|$|E

We draw on ARMS to provide the distribution of commodity and conservation payments by farm size. Although limits on payments to large farms have long been addressed by the periodic US Farm Acts, payments continue to be concentrated on large farms largely because of their historical ties to farm production.
