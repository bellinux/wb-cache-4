40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} the role of band edge discontinuities on ionisation rates in Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs/GaAs multilayer structures has been undertaken. This was investigated initially by measuring the electron and hole multiplication characteristics, M_e, and M_h, in a series of Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs/GaAs <b>single</b> <b>heterojunction</b> pin diode structures with x= 0. 3, 0. 45 and 0. 6, and with the i-type Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs and GaAs layers equally 500 A thick. The microscopic aspects of hot carrier transport in these devices were studied numerically using a simple Monte Carlo model. The simulations suggest that the advantage obtained from the conduction band edge step down from Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs to GaAs is offset by the energy loss via the higher phonon scattering rate in the Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs layer. The investigations were then extended to multilayer structures. The ionisation and multiplication behaviour in the Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs/GaAs periodic structures were predictable after the effects of a <b>single</b> <b>heterojunction</b> on the carrier ionisation process had been understood. The measured and modelled results were found to be in good agreement. It was found that for multiplication lengths exceeding 0. 3 #mu#m the effects of dead space become insignificant and M_e in the multilayer structures samples the ionisation properties of both the Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs barrier and the GaAs well. As a result only 'equivalent alloy' behaviour is observed. No electron ionisation enhancement is observed for any of the Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs/GaAs structures studied because the effects of the band edge discontinuities at the heterojunction interface on M_e are compensated by the different energy loss rates in Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs and GaAs. The different carrier dynamics in Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs and GaAs are important aspects in considering carrier multiplication in devices incorporating Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs/GaAs heterostructures. Photomultiplication in the Al_ 0 _. _ 3 Ga_ 0 _. _ 7 As/GaAs <b>single</b> <b>heterojunction</b> was also examined at lower temperatures. The effect of energy gain from the band edge discontinuity is found always to be offset by the higher energy loss rate in Al_ 0 _. _ 3 Ga_ 0 _. _ 7 As compared to that in GaAs, for lattice temperatures ranging from 20 K to 300 K.
