40|$|Problem statement. Stock {{market is}} {{a major source of}} funding for {{corporations}} in the world economy. <b>Stock</b> <b>indices</b> and their dynamics are designed to assess the state of the stock market which makes this study topical. The analysis of <b>stock</b> <b>indexes</b> interdependence is crucial. Indexes of emerging markets such as Ukrainian are very sensitive to changes in global indices, therefore estimation of such dependency is very important. Ukrainian scientists started to research the problem thoroughly only a few years ago. Y. Makogon and V. Lyashenko thoroughly investigated the <b>stock</b> <b>indices</b> and ratings; V. Kucherenko characterized the PFTS; O. Mozgoviy defined the relationship between the <b>stock</b> <b>indexes</b> and indicators of economic development of Ukraine. There is an interesting work on autocorrelation analysis and study of dependency of <b>stock</b> <b>indices</b> and industries in M. Alyeksyenkova’s paper, Borovikova’s research on the <b>stock</b> <b>indices</b> behavior, Polyuhovich’s analytical papers and analysis of the <b>stock</b> <b>indices</b> quality by Belarusian scientist A. Belzetskiy. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to build a model of interaction of Ukrainian and foreign stock markets and interpretation of the model. There are different mathematical models to show the interaction of <b>stock</b> <b>indexes.</b> We are interested in finding such a model that will represent the interaction of selected indices in the long and short term.

40|$|Abstract: The {{doubt about}} whether {{socially}} responsible investment is a viable strategy for investors seeking to maximize both social and financial returns is the central question of this paper. This is addressed by investigating whether portfolio selection based on sustainability criteria harms investor’s returns, or in contrast {{it can be a}} driver of superior financial benefits. With this purpose, daily prices and returns of 4 traditional and 10 sustainable <b>stock</b> <b>indexes</b> are analyzed from 2001 to 2011 and in the peaks and downs of both bull and bear markets. One of the major results {{of this study is that}} sustainable <b>indexes</b> outperform traditional <b>stock</b> <b>indexes</b> in all the periods under analysis; however the differences on average returns are not statistically significant. Through unit root tests we acknowledge that returns are stationary and levels are nonstationary. The short-run relationship analysis based on Granger causality test reveals a feedback effect between traditional and sustainable <b>stock</b> <b>indexes</b> returns. In contrast, long-run relationship, based on cointegration analysis, points that most of the <b>stock</b> <b>indexes</b> are not cointegrated, suggesting that sustainable and traditional <b>stock</b> <b>indexes</b> do not have a long-run linkage and thus can diverge without bound...|$|R

25|$|When the {{deliverable}} asset {{exists in}} plentiful supply, {{or may be}} freely created, then {{the price of a}} futures contract is determined via arbitrage arguments. This is typical for <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures, treasury bond futures, and futures on physical commodities when they are in supply (e.g. agricultural crops after the harvest). However, when the deliverable commodity is not in plentiful supply or when it does not yet exist - for example on crops before the harvest or on Eurodollar Futures or Federal funds rate futures (in which the supposed underlying instrument is to be created upon the delivery date) - the futures price cannot be fixed by arbitrage. In this scenario there is only one force setting the price, which is simple supply and demand for the asset in the future, as expressed by supply and demand for the futures contract.|$|E
25|$|Despite slowing of the economy, as of June 2015 the Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>index,</b> the CSI 300 Index, {{which is}} based on 300 stocks traded in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, had risen nearly 150% over the past 12 months. In an effort to {{forestall}} damage from collapse of a possible economic bubble fueled by margin trading the central government raised requirements for margin lending. Economic damage from a crash in 2007-2008 was limited due to margin lending being highly restricted. In early July, after a fall in the markets of nearly 30% from their 12 June highs, there were efforts by blue-chip, often state-owned, firms, the Chinese securities industry, and the central government to stabilize the market by buying back stock and increasing purchases of the stock of established firms; however, much of the volatility has been in smaller, less-established firms that had been heavily invested in by unsophisticated, often working class, investors who had purchased stock based solely on its rapid increase in valuation. 80% of Chinese stocks are owned by individual investors, many novices. As of 10 July 2015 efforts by the China Securities Finance Corporation, CFS, a firm created by China's commodities and stock exchanges to finance trades, had apparently stabilized the market. Major Chinese securities firms were required by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to buy, and hold, a substantial amount of securities affected by the downturn. Using funds supplied by the central bank and commercial banks the China Securities Finance Corporation purchased enough stocks to halt the slide acquiring as much as 5% of the stock in some firms. Lines of credit were extended by CFS to 21 securities firms, some of which also purchased up to 5% of some companies stocks. Some of the small cap stocks acquired may be overvalued.|$|E
