5|$|After the war, Dow {{returned}} to his leadership of the prohibition movement, co-founding the National Temperance Society and Publishing House with James Black in 1865. He {{spent the rest of}} the 1860s and 1870s giving <b>speeches</b> <b>in</b> support of temperance across the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. His efforts produced little success, as the public turned against prohibition and the alcohol industry was better organized to resist. Dow expended a great deal of effort organizing and giving <b>speeches</b> <b>in</b> support of the Liberal Party before the British elections of 1874, as their leader, William Ewart Gladstone, was sympathetic to prohibition; the Liberals lost decisively, a result Gladstone and Dow blamed on liquor interests. Dow continued to promote prohibition in Britain until May 1875 when, exhausted, he returned home.|$|E

Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his <b>speeches</b> <b>in</b> favor of the president: Johnson was impeached {{by a vote of}} 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office.|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare's first plays {{were written}} in the {{conventional}} style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from {{the needs of the}} characters or the drama. The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand <b>speeches</b> <b>in</b> Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted.|$|E

5|$|After Harrison led Indiana's Republican {{delegation}} at the 1880 Republican National Convention, he {{was considered}} the state's presumptive candidate for the U.S. Senate. He gave <b>speeches</b> <b>in</b> favor of Garfield in Indiana and New York, further raising his profile in the party. However, when the Republicans retook {{the majority in the}} state legislature, Harrison's election to a six-year term in the U.S. Senate was threatened by Judge Walter Q.

Wałęsa was an informal leader of the non-governmental side in the negotiations. During the talks, he traveled throughout Poland giving <b>speeches</b> <b>in</b> support of the negotiations. At the end of the talks, the government signed an agreement to re-establish the Solidarity Trade Union and to organize semi-free elections to the Polish parliament; in accordance with the Round Table Agreement, only members of the Communist Party and its allies could stand for 65 percent of the seats in the lower house, the Sejm.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at {{the time for a}} {{national}} candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of <b>speeches</b> <b>in</b> Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
5|$|Debs appealed his {{conviction}} to the Supreme Court. In its ruling on Debs v. United States, the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding World War I and socialism. While Debs had carefully worded his <b>speeches</b> <b>in</b> {{an attempt to}} comply with the Espionage Act, the Court found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. stated in his opinion that little attention was needed since Debs' case was essentially {{the same as that of}} Schenck v.

40|$|<b>Speech</b> {{intelligibility}} <b>in</b> adverse situations, such as reverberation and noise, is conserved {{until the}} degradations reach certain thresholds. Psychoacoustic studies {{have described the}} properties of speech {{that lead to the}} conservation of its intelligibility under those circumstances. The neural mechanisms that underlie the robustness of intelligibility in these situations, however, are not yet well understood. Here, the cortical representations of <b>speech</b> <b>in</b> reverberation and <b>speech</b> plus noise <b>in</b> reverberation are studied by measuring the cortical responses of human subjects using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while they listened to continuous speech narratives. It was hypothesized that the neural processing of <b>speech</b> <b>in</b> reverberation and <b>speech</b> plus noise <b>in</b> reverberation would follow a lack of cortical synchronization as function of the degradations. Encoding models show, however, that the neural encoding of <b>speech</b> <b>in</b> reverberation follow a different mechanism than that of <b>speech</b> <b>in</b> noise. On the other hand, in the absence of noise, it is possible to reconstruct with high accuracy the envelope of reverberant speech, thus demonstrating that the reverberant speech is well encoded by the brain...|$|R
