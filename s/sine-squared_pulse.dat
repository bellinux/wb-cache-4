40|$|A {{television}} system {{is concerned with}} the faithful transmission of transient signals in a restricted bandwidth. The <b>sine-squared</b> <b>pulse</b> {{has proved to be a}} suitable test signal for such systems. The C. C. I. R. -approved method of generating such pulses uses a 7 th order network, devised by W. E. Thomson, of the British Post Office. The work described herein was aimed at the development of networks with a lower distortion than the 7 th order Thomson network, so that the pulse generator could be used for testing very low distortion systems and units. Ninth and eleventh order transfer functions, calculated by the Thomson method, gave impulse responses of superior shape, but the improvement in overshoot was moderate. Alternative methods, giving transfer functions with higher order numerators, were studied - in these, the pulse shapes were not quite so perfect, but the overshoots were smaller than those produced by Thomson functions of the same order. Four transfer functions were selected, and networks were synthesised from these. The filters were built up, and tested for insertion loss and impulse response. In the course of the work, a number of computer programs were written for various phases of the project. Descriptions of these are given, illustrated by flow charts, and sample calculations...|$|E

This pulse is made up of a sine-squared luminance pulse and a chrominance packet with a sine-squared envelope as shown in the figure below. This waveform has many advantages. First it allows for the evaluation of both gain and delay differences with a single signal. It also eliminates the need to separately establish a low-frequency amplitude reference with a white bar. Since a low-frequency reference pulse is present along with the highfrequency information, the amplitude of the pulse itself can be normalized. The HAD of 12. 5 T was chosen in order to occupy the chrominance bandwidth of NTSC as fully as possible and to produce a pulse with sufficient sensitivity to delay distortion...|$|E

40|$|In the {{conventional}} quantum mechanics (i. e., hermitian QM) the adia- batic theorem for systems subjected to time periodic fields holds only for bound systems {{and not for}} open ones (where ionization and dissociation take place) [D. W. Hone, R. Ketzmerik, and W. Kohn, Phys. Rev. A 56, 4045 (1997) ]. Here {{with the help of}} the (t,t') formalism combined with the complex scaling method we derive an adiabatic theorem for open systems and provide an analytical criteria for the validity of the adiabatic limit. The use of the complex scaling transformation plays a key role in our derivation. As a numerical example we apply the adiabatic theorem we derived to a 1 D model Hamiltonian of Xe atom which interacts with strong, monochromatic <b>sine-square</b> laser <b>pulses.</b> We show that the gener- ation of odd-order harmonics and the absence of hyper-Raman lines, even when the pulses are extremely short, can be explained {{with the help of the}} adiabatic theorem we derived...|$|R
