5|$|Ordinarily, spinner sharks do {{not pose}} a {{substantial}} danger to humans; they do not perceive large mammals as prey, as their small, narrow teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting. However, they can become excited {{by the presence of}} food, so caution is warranted if this species is encountered while <b>spearfishing.</b> As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed 16 unprovoked attacks and one provoked attack attributable to the spinner shark, none of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|Off South Africa, {{the round}} ribbontail ray is {{captured}} incidentally by prawn trawlers on offshore banks, {{but is not}} utilized. Because of its size and strength, it is also prized by sport anglers, who usually release it unharmed. South Africa sets a recreational bag limit of one ray per species per person per day, and does not allow <b>spearfishing</b> for this species. In Australian waters, this ray has been assessed as of Least Concern. Although it is caught (and discarded) by prawn trawlers, this mortality has been reduced by the mandatory installation of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). Furthermore, a portion of its Australian range lies within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This species has also been listed under Least Concern in the Maldives where, due to the tourist value of rays, the government has created protected marine reserves and banned the export of rays in 1995 and ray skins in 1996.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{validation}} of the roundscale <b>spearfish</b> (Tetrapturus georgii) within the western North Atlantic has introduced new complexities {{in the management of}} the overfished white marlin (Kajikia albida) in this region due to historical and contemporary misidentification between the two morphologically similar species. Compounding the management challenge for white marlin, which is currently assessed as a single Atlantic-wide stock, is an unclear picture of the extent of the roundscale <b>spearfish</b> 2 ̆ 7 s overall Atlantic distribution. By using genetic tools (mitochondrial DNA ND 4 L-ND 4 locus sequences) for species identification, we confirm that the roundscale <b>spearfish</b> has a much broader distribution than previously known, including the central North Atlantic and much of the western South Atlantic to at least 28 ° 52 ′S. This much wider Atlantic distribution of the roundscale <b>spearfish</b> sympatric with its morphologically similar congeners, the white marlin and longbill <b>spearfish</b> (Tetrapturus pfluegeri), raises further management complexities: it increases the geographic scale for species misidentification in catch records that form the basis for stock assessments and uncertainty in currently accepted white marlin biological parameters. Additional vigilance in obtaining accurate species identification by improved fishery onboard observer training and incorporation of genetic tools is recommended for informing management of white marlin, longbill <b>spearfish</b> and roundscale <b>spearfish</b> throughout the Atlantic...|$|R
500|$|<b>Spearfishing</b> with barbed {{harpoons}} {{along the}} sea coast was widespread by the Palaeolithic. Fish ponds surrounded Sumerian temples by 2500 BC and a Chinese classical text credited to the 5th-century BC businessman Fan Li is {{the earliest known}} work on fish farming. A surviving fragment of Isidore of Charax's 1st-century Parthian itinerary describes locals freediving for pearls in the Persian Gulf, and Oppian's 2nd-century Halieutics relates the four main Greek and Roman fishing methods as hook-and-line, netting, passive traps, and trident. Traditional fishing boats operate in near-shore waters but, during the late Middle Ages and early Modern period, fishing on the open sea—particularly cod—became important to the economic and naval development of Northern Europe, New England, and Canada. Overfishing along the coasts of the North Sea spurred the development of deep-sea fishers such as the Brixham and otter trawlers, which might serve as motherships for longlining dories; in the 19th century, advances such as rail transport, canning, and refrigeration allowed fishing to become a full-fledged industry. Improvements in sonar during the world wars were adapted as fishfinders and, during the 1950s, great factory ships caught and processed as many fish in an hour as earlier trawlers had in a season. By the 1960s, the North Atlantic and North Pacific fisheries were close to maximal exploitation. After the catch from wild marine fisheries grew from 18 million metric tons (20 million tons) in 1950 to around 85 million metric tons ( [...] million tons) by the late 1980s, it has remained essentially constant since. Chinese economic reform led to massive growth of its fishing production, from 7% of the world total in 1961 to 35% by 2010. Scientific studies of population dynamics and nationalization of formerly shared waters are both helping to cope with overexploitation but the success of modern commercial fishing has required major corrective actions: {{the collapse of the}} Grand Banks cod fishery to less than 1% of its historic levels required a complete moratorium by Canada in 1992 and China has enforced a zero-growth policy in its wild catch since 2000, redirecting its industry towards aquaculture; its annual months-long bans on fishing in disputed areas of the South China Sea is enforced over the protest of neighboring states.|$|E
2500|$|Competitive <b>spearfishing</b> {{is defined}} by the world {{governing}} body CMAS as [...] "the hunting and capture of fish underwater without the aid of artificial breathing devices, using gear that depends entirely on the physical strength of the competitor."

2500|$|The risk also differs across diving {{cultures}} and practices. [...] For example, approximately 70% of Italian divers who regularly compete in {{national and international}} <b>spearfishing</b> competitions {{have had at least}} one blackout whereas Japanese Ama divers have a low rate of blackout as they follow a conservative dive profile, limiting dive duration to one minute, resting between dives and making several short dives rather than fewer long ones.|$|E
2500|$|The {{species has}} {{also failed to}} become as a food fish and {{commercial}} resource for the islands, because of low market prices. [...] Since it competes with more commercially valuable fish, most fishers {{view it as a}} pest. Since 2008, Hawaii has conducted a series of <b>spearfishing</b> contests that targeted bluestripes, along with blue-spotted groupers and black tail snappers with the intent of removing these fish from Hawaiian waters.|$|E
2500|$|Sharks are {{equipped}} with sensory organs called the Ampullae of Lorenzini that detect the electricity generated by muscle movement. The shark's electrical receptors, which pick up movement, detect signals like those emitted from fish wounded, for example, by someone who is <b>spearfishing,</b> leading the shark to attack the person by mistake. George H. Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File, said the following regarding why people are attacked: [...] "Attacks are basically an odds game based on how many hours {{you are in the}} water".|$|E
500|$|The <b>Spearfish</b> was {{designed}} by Fairey Aviation to Admiralty Specification O.5/43 {{as a replacement for}} the Fairey Barracuda in the torpedo/dive bomber role.

2500|$|Holt was a keen outdoorsman, and had beach {{houses at}} Portsea, Victoria, and Bingil Bay, Queensland. He was {{introduced}} to <b>spearfishing</b> in 1954, and it soon became his preferred vacation activity. Holt wore a wetsuit so he could fish year round, and preferred either skin diving or snorkelling as he found air tanks burdensome and inauthentic. Once he had speared a fish, he would unzip his suit and place it inside (still bleeding), allowing him to continue fishing. According to his companions, Holt had [...] "incredible powers of endurance underwater", and sometimes kept himself amused during parliamentary debates by seeing how long he could hold his breath.

40|$|Background: Misidentifications between {{exploited}} {{species may}} lead to inaccuracies in population assessments, with potentially irreversible conservation ramifications if overexploitation of either species is occurring. A notable showcase {{is provided by the}} realization that the roundscale <b>spearfish</b> (Tetrapturus georgii), a recently validated species, has been historically misidentified as the morphologically very similar and severely overfished white marlin (Kajikia albida) (IUCN listing: Vulnerable). In effect, no information exists on the population status and evolutionary history of the enigmatic roundscale <b>spearfish,</b> a large, highly vagile and broadly distributed pelagic species. We provide the first population genetic evaluation of the roundscale <b>spearfish,</b> utilizing nuclear microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA sequence markers. Furthermore, we re-evaluated existing white marlin mitochondrial genetic data and present our findings in a comparative context to the roundscale <b>spearfish.</b> Results: Microsatellite and mitochondrial (control region) DNA markers provided mixed evidence for roundscale <b>spearfish</b> population differentiation between the western north and south Atlantic regions, depending on marker-statistical analysis combination used. Mitochondrial DNA analyses provided strong signals of historical population growth for both white marlin and roundscale <b>spearfish,</b> but higher genetic diversity and effective female population size (1. 5 - 1. 9 X) for white marlin. Conclusions: The equivocal indications of roundscale <b>spearfish</b> population structure, combined with a smaller effective female population size compared to the white marlin, already a species of concern, suggests that a species-specific and precautionary management strategy recognizing two management units is prudent for this newly validated billfish...|$|R
