40|$|Budding yeast Sec 16 {{is a large}} {{peripheral}} {{endoplasmic reticulum}} (ER) membrane protein that functions in generating COPII transport vesicles and in clustering COPII components at transitional ER (tER) sites. Sec 16 interacts with multiple COPII components. Although the COPII assembly pathway is evolutionarily conserved, Sec 16 homologues have not been described in higher eukaryotes. Here, we show that mammalian cells contain two distinct Sec 16 homologues: a large protein that we term Sec 16 L and a smaller protein that we term <b>Sec</b> 16 <b>S.</b> These proteins localize to tER sites, and an N-terminal region of each protein is necessary and sufficient for tER localization. The Sec 16 L and <b>Sec</b> 16 <b>S</b> genes are both expressed in every tissue examined, and both proteins are required in HeLa cells for ER export and for normal tER organization. Sec 16 L resembles yeast Sec 16 in having a C-terminal conserved domain that interacts with the COPII coat protein Sec 23, but <b>Sec</b> 16 <b>S</b> lacks such a C-terminal conserved domain.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effect of}} {{different}} thawing procedures for ram semen frozen in minitubes and mini straws on the fertility of sheep was {{tested in a}} field trial. Methods Altogether, 719 Norwegian Crossbred ewes, aged between six months and six-and-a-half years from 8 farms, were inseminated vaginally in natural oestrus with frozen-thawed semen. Minitubes were thawed at 70 °C for 8 sec (T 70) and mini straws either at 50 °C for 9 <b>sec</b> (<b>S</b> 50) or at 35 °C for 12 <b>sec</b> (<b>S</b> 35). Results Vaginal insemination with 200 × 10 6 spermatozoa resulted in 25 -days non-return rates of 63. 2, 59. 6, and 62. 5 % (overall 61. 8 %), respectively, and lambing rates of 56. 8, 55. 0, and 59. 2 % (overall 57. 0 %), respectively. No significant effect on fertility (as 25 -days non-return- or lambing rate) was seen for straw type/thawing temperature (P = 0. 5 / 0. 5), but semen filled in mini straws and thawed at 35 °C resulted numerically in the highest lambing rate (59. 2 %). A significant effect was, however, seen for farmer (P = > 0. 0001 /> 0. 0001) and ram (P = 0. 009 / 0. 002). Moreover, age of the ewes {{had a significant effect}} on the NR rate (0. 007), but not on lambing rate (P = 0. 2). Conclusion A vaginal deposition of frozen ram semen containing approximately 200 × 10 6 spermatozoa, filled in mini straws and thawed at 35 °C is a simplified technique that under field conditions and used on a do-it-yourself regime gives acceptable lambing rates in Norway. </p...|$|E

Abnormal preattentive arousal processes {{may contribute to}} these deficits. In this study, we investigated components of the cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP) reflecting preattentive arousal in children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children aged 3 - 8 years. Pairs of clicks (‘S 1 ’ and ‘S 2 ’) separated by a 1 <b>sec</b> <b>S</b> 1 -S 2 interstimulus interval (ISI) and much longer (8 - 10 <b>sec)</b> <b>S</b> 1 -S 1 ISIs were presented monaurally to either {{the left or right}} ear. In TD children, the P 50, P 100 and N 1 c CAEP components were strongly influenced by temporal novelty of clicks and were much greater in response to the S 1 than the S 2 click. Irrespective of the stimulation side, the ‘tangential ’ P 100 component was rightward lateralized in TD children, whereas the ‘radial ’ N 1 c component had higher amplitude contralaterally to the stimulated ear. Compared to the TD children, children with ASD demonstrated 1) reduced amplitude of the P 100 component under the condition of temporal novelty (S 1) and 2) an attenuated P 100 repetition suppression effect. The abnormalities were lateralized and depended on the presentation side. They were evident {{in the case of the}} left but not the right ear stimulation. The P 100 abnormalities in ASD correlated with the degree of developmental delay and with the severity of auditory sensory modulation difficulties observed in early life. The results suggest that some rightward-lateralized brain networks that are crucially important for arousal an...|$|E

In normal rats, 77 +/- 7 % (S. D.) of the administered leukotriene radioactivity were recovered in bile within 1 hr. The total recovery of radioactivity from bile, urine, liver, intestine, stomach, kidneys, muscular system and blood 1 hr after intravenous [3 H]leukotriene C 4 was 89 +/- 6 % (S.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between 25 -m sprint front crawl swimming performance and muscle fascicle length in young male swimmers. 23 swimmers were selected and divided into two groups according to their best records of 25 -m sprint performance: 14. 6 - 15. 7 <b>sec</b> (<b>S</b> 1, n = 11) and 15. 8 - 17 <b>sec</b> (<b>S</b> 2, n = 12). Muscle thickness and pennation angle of Biceps Brachii (BB; only muscle thickness), Triceps Brachii (TB), Vastus Lateralis (VL), Gastrocnemius Medialis (GM) and Lateralis (GL) muscles were measured by B-mode ultrasonography, and fascicle length was estimated. Although, there was no significant differences between groups in anthropometrical parameter as standing height, body mass, arm length, thigh length and leg length (p < 0. 001), however, S 1 significantly had a greater muscle thickness in VL, GL, and TB muscles (p < 0. 05). Pennation angle only in TB was significantly smaller in S 1 (p < 0. 05). S 1 in VL, GL, and TB muscles significantly had greater absolute fascicle length and in VL and TB muscles had relatively (relative to limb length) greater fascicle length (p < 0. 05). Moreover, there was a significant relationship between sprint swimming time and absolute and relative fascicle length in VL (absolute: r = - 0. 49 and relative: r = - 0. 43, both p < 0. 05) and GL (absolute: r = - 0. 47 and relative: r = - 0. 42, both p < 0. 05).

The unprecedented combination of RGS and EPIC also sheds new light on the emission of the complex nuclear region, the X-ray plume and the disk diffuse emission.

Enterotoxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus strains are, among others, staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) A, SEB, SEC, SED, SEE, SEG, SEH, SEI, SEJ, SEK, SEL and SEM. For SEC, there are three major antigentically distinct SEC subtypes, i. e. SEC 1, SEC 2 and SEC 3, {{in addition to other}} molecular variants. The nucleotide sequence homology between SEC 1, SEC 2, and SEC 3 genes is higher than 97 %; however, we were able to develop a second set of PCR primers that allowed us to differentiate the three SECs, i. e., SEC 1, SEC 2 and SEC 3, S. aureus strains.

The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze the role of ictal HR changes in localizing both mesial and lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in a group of 68 patients. The influence of the gender and the side of epilepsy on HR modulation was also evaluated. METHODS: Ictal HR was recorded during prolonged Video-EEG monitoring performed in 68 patients affected by drug-resistant TLE during a non-invasive pre-surgical protocol. According to the electro-clinical correlation, obtained by video-EEG monitoring, one hundred-thirteen seizures (n= 113) and one hundred-forty-four auras (n= 144) were identified and included in the study. Furthermore, the electro-clinical correlation allowed the classification of all the epileptic events (seizures and auras) as having mesial or lateral origin, based on the temporal lobe seizure onset zone. Ictal HR was calculated with respect to the R-R waves, and assessed from 15 <b>sec</b> (<b>s)</b> before (T(- 15)) to 15 s after (T(+ 15)) the time of EEG seizure onset (T(0)). RESULTS: We observed a high incidence (92 %) of ictal HR increase in TLE seizures. When the ictal EEG indicated a seizure onset from the mesial temporal structures, the onset of ictal HR increase preceded by about 5 s the EEG ictal onset (SD+/- 18. 4), whereas the onset of HR increase coincided with the onset of EEG discharges (SD+/- 14. 8) when the ictal EEG indicated the onset of seizures from the lateral temporal structures. No significant differences were found between male and female patients; and between right and left TLE. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that ictal HR increase, preceding the onset of the EEG discharge, is associated with ictal EEG seizure pattern defining temporal lobe seizures originating from the mesial temporal lobe structures; this association suggests that the HR changes may be coupled to the functional impairment of neural circuits involved in sympathetic cardiovascular regulation, in the mesial temporal lobe structures. Further studies investigating the relationship between intracranial EEG monitoring and ECG recording are worthwhile, to confirm our results and to give further indications on the pathogenesis of ictal HR abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUsing {{heart rate}} {{spectral}} analysis of nocturnal pulse oximetry, we prospectively evaluated {{the utility of}} this methodology in patients clinically suspected of having obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). A hundred and ninety-seven outpatients referred with symptoms compatible with the diagnosis of OSA were studied. All participants had nocturnal pulse oximetry performed simultaneously with conventional polysomnography. Power density of heart rate obtained by nocturnal pulse oximetry was analysed using fast Fourier transformation of a Hamming-windowed signal. Recording test results were classified as abnormal (suspicion of OSA) {{in the presence of}} a peak in the periodogram between period boundaries 30 – 70 sec. A normal test result was defined as the absence of the 30 – 70 sec peak in the periodogram. The total area of the periodogram (STOT), the area enclosed in the periodogram between the period boundaries 30 – 70 <b>sec</b> (<b>S</b> 30 – 70), the area enclosed in the period boundaries 30 – 70 sec with respect to the total area of the periodogram (S) and the peak amplitude 30 – 70 sec (PA) were measured. The presence of a peak in the periodogram has a sensitivity of 81 · 3 %, a specificity of 91 · 5 %, a positive predictive value of 89 · 1 % and a negative predictive value of 85 · 1 % for OSA diagnosis. The OSA patients were found to have higher values of STOT, S 30 – 70, S and PA than the non-OSA patients. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was constructed at different thresholds of STOT, S 30 – 70 S and PA. For a PA threshold of 10 (%) 2, heart rate spectral analysis sensitivity for OSA was 58 % and specificity was 92 %. Furthermore, the positive and negative predictive values for diagnosis of OSA were 87 and 72 % respectively. Apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) correlated significantly with STOT(r= 0 · 44;P< 0 · 001), S 30 – 70 (r= 0 · 59;P< 0 · 001), S (r= 0 · 58;P< 0 · 001) and PA (r= 0 · 58;P< 0 · 001). According to our results, heart rate spectral analysis obtained by nocturnal pulse oximetry and identification of peak in the periodogram between period boundaries 30 – 70 sec could be useful as a diagnostic technique for OSA patients...|$|E
40|$|While play {{occurs in}} many taxa with younger conspecifics {{engaging}} in play behaviors {{more often than}} older conspecifics, little empirical research currently exists on play by white whales, or belugas, (Delphinapterus leucas). The {{purpose of the current}} study was to explore the types of play exhibited by a group of belugas in human care. Archived video footage representing 24. 5 hours of observation time collected over three years for 14 belugas (5 immature and 9 adults) was coded for type, frequency, and duration of all play events. Out of 2, 092 play events, the belugas produced 497 bouts of play and preferred to engage in independent forms of play (92 %) as opposed to coordinating their activities together (8 %). Immature belugas exhibited four times as many play bouts (n = 405) compared to adult play events (n = 92) and included motor play, water play, and object play as well as some social interactions (e. g., play chases). When compared to all types of play, play with objects represented 50 % of the bouts, and when the degree of diversity of play was considered all belugas showed more diversity with environmental enrichment devices (EEDs) present (83 % of diverse play bouts) than when exhibiting motor or water play. Age and sex of the belugas also influenced the type of play (i. e., motor, water, or EEDs) exhibited during different degrees of complexity of play bouts (i. e., single events, repetitive bouts, diverse bouts, and complex cooperative social play). When sex of the beluga was considered, males appeared to prefer to engage in motor play while females appeared to prefer to engage in object play during single play events (males: n = 68, 64 %, females: n = 55, 52 %) and repetitive bouts (males: n = 18, 62 %, females: n = 20, 54 %). Some complex cooperative play bouts between immature belugas and between immature and adult belugas (n = 42, 10 %) were observed. Play bouts involving EEDs lasted significantly longer (M = 55. 38 <b>sec,</b> <b>s</b> = 2. 85) and produced greater diversity in play behaviors for all belugas combined. In summary, belugas of all ages engage in spontaneous play behaviors, but the age and sex of each beluga produce different play preferences...|$|E

40|$|The SraP adhesin of Staphylococcus aureus is {{a member}} of a highly conserved family of serine-rich surface glycoproteins of gram-positive bacteria. For streptococci, export of the SraP homologs {{requires}} a specialized transport pathway (the accessory Sec system). Compared to streptococci, however, SraP is predicted to differ in its signal peptide and glycosylation, which may affect its dependence on a specialized system for transport. In addition, two genes (asp 4 and asp 5) essential for export in Streptococcus gordonii are missing in S. aureus. Thus, the selectivity of the accessory <b>Sec</b> system in <b>S.</b> aureus may also differ compared to streptococci. To address these issues, the five genes encoding the putative accessory Sec system (secY 2, secA 2, and asp 1 - 3) were disrupted individually in S. aureus ISP 479 C, and the resultant mutants were examined for SraP export. Disruption of secA 2 resulted in the near complete loss of SraP surface expression. Similar results were seen with disruption of secY 2 and asp 1, asp 2, or asp 3. To assess whether the accessory Sec system transported other substrates, we compared secreted proteomes of ISP 479 C and a secA 2 isogenic mutant, by two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis. Although two consistent differences in proteome content were noted between the strains, neither protein appeared to be a likely substrate for accessory Sec export. Thus, the accessory <b>Sec</b> system of <b>S.</b> aureus is required for the export of SraP, and it appears to be dedicated to the transport of this substrate exclusively...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{metals and alloys}} to form and retain {{protective}} oxide scales is crucial to their stability at elevated temperatures for extended times. Hence the identification of factors that promote or limit the integrity of oxides on high temperature materials {{has been the subject}} of intensive investigations. In the present study the mechanical properties of this chromiwm. -rkh scale on 304 stainless steel foil has been investigated in relation to the deformation rates in the substrate. It was shown that heavy cold working (up to 90 %) delays the onset of breakaway oxidation and results in a very adherent scale. The cracking behaviour of the scale was found to be strain rate and temperature dependent under slow strain rate conditions when the substrate deforms by creep. No strain rate dependence was observed over the temperature range 700 - 900 °C when faster strain rates (> 10 - <b>S</b> <b>sec</b> - 1) were applied. The transition between these two responses was found to vary only slightly with temperature between S. Ox 10 - S sec- 1 and 7. Sx 10 - <b>S</b> <b>sec</b> - 1,increasing as the temperature is raised. A new method has been described for determining the fracture behaviour of oxide scale by estimating the composite defect size. From a knowledge of the onset of scale cracking, determined in Sl(U usi ng (h~ acoustic emission technique, it was possible to correlate the measured intercrack spacing with the fracture toughness from which the tensile properties of the scale can be evaluated...|$|R
