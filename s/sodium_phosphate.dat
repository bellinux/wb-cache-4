25|$|The {{day before}} the colonoscopy, the patient is either given a {{laxative}} preparation (such as Picosalax, Bisacodyl, phospho soda, sodium picosulfate, or <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> and/or magnesium citrate) and large quantities of fluid, or whole bowel irrigation is performed using a solution of polyethylene glycol and electrolytes. Often, the procedure involves both a pill-form laxative and a bowel irrigation preparation with the polyethylene glycol powder dissolved into any clear liquid, preferably a sports drink that contains electrolytes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{factor is the}} mobile phase pH since it can change the hydrophobic character of the analyte. For this reason most methods use a buffering agent, such as <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> to control the pH. Buffers serve multiple purposes: control of pH, neutralize the charge on the silica surface of the stationary phase and act as ion pairing agents to neutralize analyte charge. Ammonium formate is commonly added in mass spectrometry to improve detection of certain analytes by the formation of analyte-ammonium adducts. A volatile organic acid such as acetic acid, or most commonly formic acid, is often added to the mobile phase if mass spectrometry is {{used to analyze the}} column effluent. Trifluoroacetic acid is used infrequently in mass spectrometry applications due to its persistence in the detector and solvent delivery system, but can be effective in improving retention of analytes such as carboxylic acids in applications utilizing other detectors, as it is a fairly strong organic acid. The effects of acids and buffers vary by application but generally improve chromatographic resolution.|$|E

Although titrimetric assays are very well established and precise, iodimetric determination of <b>sodium</b> cysteamine <b>phosphate</b> requires considerably more carefulness and time from the analyst than usual. The possibility to assess <b>sodium</b> cysteamine <b>phosphate</b> by CE was evaluated by means of the quantification of its oxidation product, cystamine, which is a more suitable substance to be used as primary standard than <b>sodium</b> cysteamine <b>phosphate.</b> Apparently, this approach should be straightforward, but systematic differences between the results obtained with CE and titrimetric assays were noticed. MS and CE-MS were employed to aid in the investigation of the possible causes of imprecision of the <b>sodium</b> cysteamine <b>phosphate</b> titration and CE determination. For this purpose, a simple and inexpensive ESI source was constructed. It was observed that cystamine is not the final product of the cysteamine and/or <b>sodium</b> cysteamine <b>phosphate</b> iodine-oxidation and other species besides cystamine may be formed depending on the reaction conditions, which explains the difficulties observed in the <b>sodium</b> cysteamine <b>phosphate</b> quantification. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{tribological}} {{behaviors of}} {{three types of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphates</b> (<b>sodium</b> ortho-, pyro-, and metaphosphate) with different chain lengths are evaluated using the ball-on-disk tribometer at 800 °C.

XPS spectra indicate a phosphate glassy film consisting of Na, Fe, P, and O elements formed on the tribostressed area. The tribochemistry of tribosurface investigated by XPS and XANES reveals that NaPO 3 and Na 4 P 2 O 7 react with oxide wear debris to produce mixed short-chain Na/Fe polyphosphate in the tribostressed area, leading to a severe depolymerization for NaPO 3 and a slight polymerization for Na 4 P 2 O 7.

5000|$|When {{the group}} of casein {{micelles}} are exposed to heat and shearing forces, kappa-casein is cleaved causing the displacement of the glycosylated hydrophilic tails. The casein micelle becomes destabilized as alpha and beta-casein are now exposed to the environment. Emulsifying agents such as <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{play an important role}} in stabilizing the newly destabilized structure. The hydrophilic portion of <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> removes calcium from the calcium paracaseinate from ion exchange reactions. This action causes “hydration and partial dispersion of the calcium-paracaseinate phosphate network." [...] The hydration process increases the solubility of the protein. <b>Sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> removes calcium from the Ca-paracaseinate cheese complex due to ion exchange interactions, where positive calcium ions bind to the negative phosphate groups. Phosphate and citrate anions can then bind to the protein structure, converting calcium-paracaseinate converts to water-soluble sodium-paracaseinate. Upon cooling, the partially dispersed matrix forms a gel-like network that gives rise to the textural properties of the final product.|$|E
