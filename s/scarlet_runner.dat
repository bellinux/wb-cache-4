25|$|By roughly 6000 BC, hunter-gatherers {{living in}} the {{highlands}} and lowlands of Mesoamerica began to develop agricultural practices with early cultivation of squash and chilli. The earliest example of maize dates to c. 4000 BC and comes from Guilá Naquitz, a cave in Oaxaca. Earlier maize samples have been documented at the Los Ladrones cave site in Panama, c. 5500 BC. Slightly thereafter, other crops began to be cultivated by the semi-agrarian communities throughout Mesoamerica. Although maize {{is the most common}} domesticate, the common bean, tepary bean, <b>scarlet</b> <b>runner</b> bean, jicama, tomato and squash all became common cultivates by 3500 BC. At the same time, cotton, yucca and agave were exploited for fibers and textile materials. By 2000 BC, corn was the staple crop in the region and remained so through modern times. The Ramón or Breadnut tree (Brosimum alicastrum) was an occasional substitute for maize in producing flour. Fruit was also important in the daily diet of Mesoamerican cultures. Some of the main ones consumed include avocado, papaya, guava, mamey, zapote, and annona.|$|E

60|$|The {{premises}} of Mr Mould were {{hard of hearing}} to the boisterous noises in the great main streets, and nestled in a quiet corner, where the City strife became a drowsy hum, that sometimes rose and sometimes fell and sometimes altogether ceased; suggesting to a thoughtful mind a stoppage in Cheapside.

In an adjoining row of Fulmer's dwarf bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) one single plant escaped. A still more severe frost occurred four days afterwards, and of the dozen plants which had previously escaped only three survived; these were not taller or more vigorous than the other young plants, but they escaped completely, with not even the tips of their leaves browned. It was impossible to behold these three plants, with their blackened, withered, and dead brethren all around them, and not see at a glance that they differed widely in their constitutional power of resisting frost." ...|$|R

50|$|Common {{beans in}} {{moderate}} temperature regions {{are victims of}} halo blights. Main hosts are lima beans, red kidney bean, cranberry yellow eye field beans, snap beans, <b>scarlet</b> <b>runner,</b> kudzu vine and common P.vulgaris. Halo blight is affected by environment factors and enter through plant injuries or natural openings. The development of the Halo blight is highly favored by cool temperature (such as 20-23°C), unlike other common bacterial blights. In warm temperatures (over 24 °C), the production of phaseolotoxin decreases and symptoms become less obvious. Phaseolotoxin is a toxin produced by Halo blight pathogen which causes systemic chlorosis. Halo blight causes small water-soaked spots on leaves. These spot progressively turn dark brown and are surrounded by a wide greenish yellow halo. The necrotic spots remain small unlike that of common blight. Similar to foliage symptoms, halo blights causes water-soaked spots on vegetative pods. It also causes streaks along pod sutures. If lesions becomes severe on the pods, it may penetrate the pod walls or expand into the pod sutures which causes the seed to be wrinkled and discolored (yellow patches on the seed coat). Systemic infections are not common, but occur more favorably in some dry bean varieties. If the disease develops a systemic infection, it will cause curling, yellowing and death of young leaflets.|$|E

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Vegetables IPM Fact SheetBean anthracnose, {{caused by}} the fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, is a major disease of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), causing serious crop loss {{in many parts of}} the world. In 1921, M. F. Barrus of Cornell University {{demonstrated}} that bean anthracnose is seedborne. This information resulted in the widespread use of anthracnose-free seed and a subsequent decline in the occurrence of bean anthracnose in the United States. In bean-growing areas that receive frequent rainfall, however, such as central and western New York State, epidemics of the disease may develop. Production is reduced because of poor seed germination, poor seedling vigor, and low yields. Marketing losses are attributed to seed spots and blemishes, which lower their quality rating and salability. The disease is most common and severe on dry and snap beans (P. vulgaris) but may also affect lima bean (P. lunatus L.), <b>scarlet</b> <b>runner</b> bean (P. multiflorus Willd.), mung bean (P. aureus Roxb.), cowpea (Vigna sinensis Savi), and broad bean (Vicia faba L.) ...|$|E

P. coccineus genotypes PI 255956 ('Mayan White Runner') and PI 535278 (Tars- 046 A) were more resistant than susceptible 'Wolven Pole'. Sensitivity to oxalate ranked highest for Wolven Pole, lowest for PI 255956, and intermediate for PI 535278. Oxalate concentrations were similar in infected stem tissues of the partially resistant lines and lower than Wolven Pole. Moreover, oxalate oxidase and superoxide dismutase activities were absent in the more resistant lines but induced in Wolven Pole. Collectively, these results suggest that genetic differences in susceptibility to S. sclerotiorum among different P. coccineus lines are partially dependent on oxalic acid. ?? 2005 The American Phytopathological Society...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Bean seed storage {{requires}} specific {{control of}} temperature and humidity. Different research institutions have expensive equipment and controls {{to maintain and}} preserve germplasm viability. However, not all laboratory facilities have the recommended equipment to guarantee long term storage with no adverse effects on seed germination and vigor.

Gray), the <b>scarlet</b> <b>runner</b> bean (P. coccineus L.) and other grain legume species, it has been necessary to maintain small quantities of seeds originating from experiments conducted at the greenhouse located in the Mayagüez campus of the University of Puerto Rico. Over these years, seeds harvested in the greenhouse have been stored in a laboratory refrigerator.

40|$|One of {{the major}} unsolved issues in plant {{development}} is understanding the regulatory networks that control the differential gene activity that {{is required for the}} specification and development of the two major embryonic regions, the embryo proper and suspensor. Historically, the giant embryo of <b>scarlet</b> <b>runner</b> bean (SRB), Phaseolus coccineus, {{has been used as a}} model system to investigate the physiological events that occur early in embryogenesis – focusing on the question of what role the suspensor region plays. A major feature distinguishing SRB embryos from those of other plants is a highly enlarged suspensor containing at least 200 cells that synthesize growth regulators required for subsequent embryonic development. Recent studies have exploited the giant size of the SRB embryo to micro-dissect the embryo proper and suspensor regions in order to use genomics-based approaches to identify regulatory genes that may be involved in controlling suspensor and embryo proper differentiation, as well as the cellular processes that may be unique to each embryonic region.

40|$|The <b>scarlet</b> <b>runner</b> bean is a {{climbing}} perennial crop but it {{is often}} grown as an annual for dry seeds and immature green pods production {{in some parts of}} Europe. The runner bean cultivars are appreciated for their large seeds and culinary quality together with high yield. As observed by the authors and local farmers, the runner bean generally requires moderate temperatures for good germination and growth and the optimum temperature ranges from 20 ºC to 30 ºC. Thus, temperature is a limiting factor for runner bean production and temperature under 10 ºC at sowing delays both germination and plant emergence, lengthening the crop cycle and increasing production costs. Therefore, an alternative to make maximum utilization of the available growing period is to use cultivars tolerant to sub-optimal temperature at the germination and emergence stages. The performance of cultivars under different growing conditions was evaluated in growing chamber at optimal (17 ºC-day/ 15 ºC-night) and sub-optimal (14 ºC-day/ 8 ºC-night) temperature on the basis of germination, earliness, ability to grow and vigor (Rodiño et al. 2007).
