40|$|This study {{compared}} the gender roles {{and attitudes toward}} women‟s and men‟s social roles of <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home fathers and employed fathers recruited on the Internet. The relationship between gender roles and attitudes toward women‟s and men‟s social roles on reasons for becoming a <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home father were also investigated. It was predicted that <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home fathers would endorse more traditionally feminine characteristics for themselves and would have more nontraditional attitudes toward men‟s and women‟s social roles than employed fathers. In addition, {{it was predicted that}} fathers who choose to <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home for practical reasons (i. e. lost job) would be more traditional in their gender role attitudes than fathers who choose to <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home for other reasons (i. e. really wanted to care for the children). Although <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home and employed fathers reported having similar feminine and masculine characteristics, <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home fathers reported having less traditional gender role attitudes than employed fathers. Biosocial theory (Eagly & Wood, 1999) suggests that <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home fathers may have less traditional attitudes about gender roles because the gender role they are acting out is a non-traditional role for men. <b>Stay</b> <b>at</b> home fathers reported that they really wanted to stay home with their children more than any other reason, whereas the least reported reason for choosing to stay home was having a child with special needs. Contrary to a prediction based on evolutionary psychology, <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home and employed fathers also reported that their children resembled them to the same degree. The results of this study will contribute further information about a group of fathers that have been under-studied and may also provide helpful information to support groups for <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> home and employed fathers.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{people with}} chronic nonspecific {{musculoskeletal}} pain (CMP) have decreased work ability. The majority, however, <b>stays</b> <b>at</b> work despite their pain. Knowledge about workers who <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> work despite chronic pain is limited, narrowing our views on work participation. The {{aim of this}} study was to explore why people with CMP <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> work despite pain (motivators) and how they manage to maintain working (success factors). Methods A semi-structured interview was conducted among 21 subjects who <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> work despite CMP. Participants were included through purposeful sampling. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and imported into computer software Atlas. ti. Data was analyzed by means of thematic analysis. The interviews consisted of open questions such as: "Why are you working with pain?" or "How do you manage working while having pain?" Results A total of 16 motivators and 52 success factors emerged in the interviews. Motivators were categorized into four themes: work as value, work as therapy, work as income generator, and work as responsibility. Success factors were categorized into five themes: personal characteristics, adjustment latitude, coping with pain, use of healthcare services, and pain beliefs. Conclusions Personal characteristics, well-developed self-management skills, and motivation to work may be considered to be important success factors and prerequisites for <b>staying</b> <b>at</b> work, resulting in behaviors promoting <b>staying</b> <b>at</b> work such as: raising adjustment latitude, changing pain-coping strategies, organizing modifications and conditions at work, finding access to healthcare services, and asking for support. Motivators and success factors for <b>staying</b> <b>at</b> work may be used for interventions in rehabilitation and occupational medicine, to prevent absenteeism, or to promote a sustainable return to work. This qualitative study has evoked new hypotheses about <b>staying</b> <b>at</b> work; quantitative studies on <b>staying</b> <b>at</b> work are needed to obtain further evidence. </p...|$|R
