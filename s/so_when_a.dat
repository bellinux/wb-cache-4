5|$|Both spiders and {{scorpions}} are venomous, {{so their}} threat displays can be considered generally aposematic. However, some predators such as hedgehogs and spider-hunting wasps (Pompilidae) actively hunt arachnids, overcoming their defences, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> hedgehog is startled by, for instance, the sounds made by a scorpion, {{there is reason to}} describe the display as deimatic.|$|E
5|$|The males sing {{throughout}} much of the construction and even more <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> female approaches his nest. Following copulation, the male and female continue to build the nest. Nests may be in any type of hole, common locations include inside hollowed trees, buildings, tree stumps and man-made nest-boxes. S. v. zetlandicus typically breeds in crevices and holes in cliffs, a habitat only rarely used by the nominate form. Nests are typically made out of straw, dry grass and twigs with an inner lining made up of feathers, wool and soft leaves. Construction usually takes four or five days and may continue through incubation.|$|E
5|$|Tina (McShera) {{arrives at}} a Victorian villa for a séance. Hives (Shearsmith) settles Tina before {{retrieving}} Talbot (Steadman), who arrives shrouded in black and carrying a doll. Talbot, an elderly woman with heavy cataracts, speaks in a high-pitched voice, unnerving Tina. When the séance begins, objects fly around the room, Talbot's voice becomes demonic and ectoplasm seeps from her mouth. Hives encourages Tina not to break the circle, but she does <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> blue-faced demon (Starkey) appears behind her. She is terrified until Hives reveals himself to be Terry, {{the host of a}} hidden camera programme called Scaredy Cam.|$|E

50|$|The {{game was}} created to be child-friendly, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> animal is brought in, it doesn't act vicious or have any cuts or blood or {{anything}} similar. The game can teach you about wild African animals, and the problems that they can get.|$|R
5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E

5000|$|Ainu {{folklore}} {{held that}} due to its odor, this wild onion was capable of repelling diseases. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> epidemic broke out, the onion would be left hanging at the entrances to the village or dangled from the eaves of each house.。 ...|$|R
50|$|<b>So,</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> {{option is}} traded with one party opening and one party closing, the open {{interest}} remains unchanged. If both {{parties in the}} transaction are closing positions then the open interest decreases accordingly. If both parties are opening positions then the open interest goes up accordingly.|$|R
50|$|TCAS {{works in}} <b>a</b> coordinated manner, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> RA is issued to {{conflicting}} aircraft, a required action (i.e., Climb. Climb.) {{has to be}} immediately performed {{by one of the}} aircraft, while the other one receives a similar RA in the opposite direction (i.e., Descend. Descend.).|$|R
25|$|Vysotsky had {{a unique}} singing style. He had an unusual habit of {{elongating}} consonants instead of vowels in his songs. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> syllable is sung for {{a prolonged period}} of time, he would elongate the consonant instead of the vowel in that syllable.|$|E
25|$|Another form {{of grief}} in animals is when an {{individual}} loses its mate; this can be especially brutal when the species is monogamous. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> pair bonding species, such as a black-backed jackal, loses its mate {{it can be very}} difficult for it to detach itself from its dead mate.|$|E
25|$|In 23 Test innings he {{had managed}} a highest score of 89 and a second highest of just 47 <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> Test series {{scheduled}} against Pakistan followed the Sri Lanka series in January 2002 he was perhaps fortunate {{to be included in}} the squad. The series took place at Sharjah due to security reasons and in the 2nd Test Ganga made 65 in the first innings.|$|E

25|$|By the 1930s, the {{steamboat}} {{service to}} the school {{was more of a}} tradition than a necessity, and it was losing clientele Bay-wide due to the increased usage of automobiles. The main roads leading to the college were also by then paved. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> storm destroyed the school dock in 1934, the school let go of the steamboat service and transportation to the college was thereafter only by automobile.|$|E
25|$|These {{efforts were}} wasted as {{details of the}} plan {{were given to the}} British by François de Bussy, French Ambassador in London, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> French naval force left Brest on 26 January, the Royal Navy refused the bait. Fierce storms then sank 12 French ships and {{severely}} damaged the transports, while the British government arrested a number of suspected Jacobites. Louis cancelled the invasion at the end of March, declared war on Britain in October and thereafter focused on campaigns in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{television}} sets, however, {{usually have}} a built-in memory, often for a few thousand different pages. This way, the teletext decoder captures every page sent out and stores it in memory, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> page is requested by the user it can be loaded directly from memory {{instead of having to}} wait for the page to be transmitted. When the page is transmitted again, the television checks if the page in memory is still up-to-date and updates it if necessary.|$|E

25|$|While the Hawker Fury offered better performance, lower {{production}} volumes {{made it more}} expensive and therefore it remained available only in small numbers, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> fighter version of the Hart was suggested, the Air Ministry selected the type as an interim fighter until higher-performance fighters could be bought in larger numbers. The new fighter variant added a second Vickers machine gun, while the coaming of the rear cockpit was angled to give a better field of fire, and a supercharged Kestrel IS engine was fitted. Evaluation of an initial batch of six aircraft, known as Hart Fighters by one flight of 23 Squadron during 1931 was successful, and larger orders followed for the fighter Hart, {{now known as the}} Hawker Demon. The Demon's first flight was on 10 February 1933.|$|E
25|$|There {{really are}} two {{different}} kinds of DDD: Inside and Outside Abraded Die Doubling. This is because Die Deterioration Doubling manifests itself in two different ways. The two classes look different, and are caused by wear in two different places. Inside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by wear around the edges and inside the actual detail affected. It appears as an enlarged, irregular outline of the element overlapping the original design element. Outside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by actual wear {{in the field of}} the die. The field of a die is the highest point, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> mint technician polishes the die or the metal flow of a coin wears it away, the field is the first thing to be worn down. The difference here is that Outside doubling does not overlap any of the original design, but rather appears like an irregular shelf around the object.|$|E
25|$|On Christmas of 1868, {{shortly after}} {{the opening of the}} port, a horse race was held at the riding ground in the northeastern portion of the settlement, where the town plan had been delayed. This race set a precedent, and cricket and {{track-and-field}} events came to be held in the same spot. Even so, this was to the foreign residents only a temporary opportunity until the town plan was completed, and demand rose for an area to be officially allocated for sports. The residents recalled that the Japanese government had promised the establishment of such a sports ground, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> large plot of land appeared to the east of the settlement during the reconstruction of the Ikuta River between April 29 and July 26, 1871, a rumor spread among them that this was to become the sports ground.|$|E

25|$|In the anime, a Mr. Mime {{lives with}} Delia Ketchum. He does {{housework}} {{for her in}} exchange for room and board. Ash dressed as a Mr. Mime to inspire a real Mr. Mime who worked for a circus. Delia knew about this, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> wild Mr. Mime came to her door and wanted lunch, {{she thought it was}} Ash in costume, and provided it with food. When the real Ash showed up, still in costume, she was quite puzzled, but wound up keeping Mimey as her live-in maid. It will only listen to Delia, and if anyone else, even Ash, gives it orders, or asks it to do something, it will normally ignore them. It is unknown if Delia has actually captured Mimey, as she is never shown with its Poké Ball. When Ash and his friends returned to Pallet Town following the Orange Islands saga, it was revealed that Brock and Mimey had become rather competitive regarding household tasks while {{the two of them were}} sharing the house with Delia.|$|E
25|$|Another {{view is that}} a stutter (stammer) is {{a complex}} tic. This view is held for the {{following}} reasons. It always arises from repetition of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, the more they like this outlet for their tension – an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. <b>So,</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> 3 year old finds {{he has a new}} baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3–4 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more cortisol than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} recent experiment demonstrates {{several aspects of}} bee learning. Foragers were trained to enter a simple Y-shaped maze that had been marked at the entrance with a particular color. Inside the maze was a branching point where the bee was required to choose between two paths. One path, {{which led to the}} food reward, was marked with the same color that had been used {{at the entrance to the}} maze, while the other was marked with a different color. Foragers learned to choose the correct path, and continued to do <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> different kind of marker (black and white stripes oriented in various directions) was substituted for the colored markers. When the experimental conditions were reversed, rewarding bees for choosing the inner passage marked with a symbol that was different from the entrance symbol, the bees again learned to choose the correct path. Variations in the length of the tunnel between the stimulus markers showed that bees retain information in working memory for about 5 seconds, equivalent to the short-term memory of birds. Altogether, the experiments demonstrated that bees can to choose between alternatives, determine if a stimulus is the same or different than one seen earlier, remember the earlier one for a short period, and generalize this performance to new pairs of stimuli.|$|E
