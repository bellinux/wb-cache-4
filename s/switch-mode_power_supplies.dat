25|$|High current power-frequency devices, such as {{electric}} motors, {{generators and}} transformers, use multiple small conductors in parallel {{to break up}} the eddy flows that can form within large solid conductors. The same principle is applied to transformers used at higher than power frequency, for example, those used in <b>switch-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> and the intermediate frequency coupling transformers of radio receivers.|$|E
25|$|For low {{to medium}} frequencies, {{conductors}} {{can be divided}} into stranded wires, each insulated from one another, and the relative positions of individual strands specially arranged within the conductor bundle. Wire constructed using this technique is called Litz wire. This measure helps to partially mitigate skin effect by forcing more equal current throughout the total cross section of the stranded conductors. Litz wire is used for making high-Q inductors, reducing losses in flexible conductors carrying very high currents at lower frequencies, and in the windings of devices carrying higher radio frequency current (up to hundreds of kilohertz), such as <b>switch-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> and radio frequency transformers.|$|E
2500|$|Three-phase {{electrical}} {{generation is}} very common. The simplest {{way is to}} use three separate coils in the generator stator, physically offset by an angle of 120° (one-third of a complete 360° phase) to each other. Three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120° out of phase to each other. If coils are added opposite to these (60° spacing), they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired together. In practice, higher [...] "pole orders" [...] are commonly used. For example, a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10° spacing). The advantage is that lower rotational speeds {{can be used to}} generate the same frequency. For example, a 2-pole machine running at 3600rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600rpm produce the same frequency; the lower speed is preferable for larger machines. If the load on a three-phase system is balanced equally among the phases, no current flows through the neutral point. Even in the worst-case unbalanced (linear) load, the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents. Non-linear loads (e.g. the <b>switch-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> widely used) may require an oversized neutral bus and neutral conductor in the upstream distribution panel to handle harmonics. Harmonics can cause neutral conductor current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: – A novel <b>switch-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (SMPS) {{concept is}} {{presented}} which is especially suited to high input voltages. The topology {{is based on}} a multi-cell arrangement where individual DC-DC converter cells are connected in series regarding their input side whereas the isolated output stages of the cells are connected in parallel. The identical cells are realized as self-oscillating series-resonant converters operated at near unity duty cycle. Consequently, the cell only performs an isolation function, the voltage regulation is realized by a subsequent non-isolated DC-DC converter at low voltage level. The isolation stage is based on the well known half-bridge topology utilizing efficient standard medium-voltage MOSFETs. A very interesting feature of the proposed system is that it is characterized by an inherent equalizing of the input voltage of the individual cells without any control requirements. The paper gives a short introduction to the basic problems of SMPS for high input voltages, describes the basic operation of the presented topology and gives a dimensioning as well as simulation results and presents measurement results taken from a laboratory prototype.
