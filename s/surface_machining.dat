40|$|AbstractUse {{of powder}} {{metallurgy}} processed (PM) electrode in {{electrical discharge machining}} (EDM) has emerged as an alternate tooling option {{with a view to}} impart improved surface properties to the work surface. Preliminary investigation with CuW PM electrode using Taguchi method was done on Inconel 718 to obtain best parameter settings for higher the better surface roughness. In the present work surface micro hardness study and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on the <b>machined</b> <b>surface</b> at the best parameter setting and comparison was done with the <b>surface</b> <b>machined</b> using conventional copper electrode. It was observed that the micro hardness of the <b>machined</b> <b>surface</b> was improved from 380. 9 HV of the base metal to 496. 7 HV of the <b>surface</b> <b>machined</b> with powder metallurgy processed electrode.

50|$|Though MEMS {{processes}} are generally classified {{into a number}} of categories - such as <b>surface</b> <b>machining,</b> bulk machining, LIGA, and EFAB - there are indeed thousands of different MEMS processes. Some produce fairly simple geometries, while others offer more complex 3-D geometries and more versatility. A company making accelerometers for airbags would need a completely different design and process to produce an accelerometer for inertial navigation. Changing from an accelerometer to another inertial device such as a gyroscope requires an even greater change in design and process, and most likely a completely different fabrication facility and engineering team.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} successful rotary kilns {{were developed}} in Pennsylvania around 1890, based on a design by Frederick Ransome, and were about 1.5 m in diameter and 15 m in length. Such a kiln made about 20 tonnes of clinker per day. The fuel, initially, was oil, which was readily available in Pennsylvania at the time. It was particularly easy {{to get a good}} flame with this fuel. Within the next 10 years, the technique of firing by blowing in pulverized coal was developed, allowing the use of the cheapest available fuel. By 1905, the largest kilns were 2.7 x 60 m in size, and made 190 tonnes per day. At that date, after only 15 years of development, rotary kilns accounted for half of world production. Since then, the capacity of kilns has increased steadily, and the largest kilns today produce around 10,000 tonnes per day. In contrast to static kilns, the material passes through quickly: it takes from 3 hours (in some old wet process kilns) to as little as 10 minutes (in short precalciner kilns). Rotary kilns run 24 hours a day, and are typically stopped only for a few days {{once or twice a year}} for essential maintenance. One of the main maintenance works on rotary kilns is tyre and roller <b>surface</b> <b>machining</b> and grinding works which can be done while the kiln works in full operation at speeds up to 3.5 rpm. This is an important discipline, because heating up and cooling down are long, wasteful and damaging processes. Uninterrupted runs as long as 18 months have been achieved.|$|E

40|$|Pressure tube material, Zr- 2. 5 Nb, of {{pressurized}} {{heavy water}} reactors was given selective heat-treatments. The {{objective was to}} generate microstructures with different compositions of the second phase beta namely, Nb depleted beta(Zr) phase and Nb rich beta(Nb) phase. The material with bZr was then subjected to <b>surface</b> <b>machining.</b> The presence of phases after different heat-treatments was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and the resultant microstructures were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and electron back scattered diffraction. The Nb content in the beta phase after heat-treatments and residual stresses before and after <b>surface</b> <b>machining</b> were measured using X-ray diffraction. Oxidation {{was carried out in}} steam at 400 degrees C and 10 MPa up to 30 days and the oxides were characterized by Raman spectroscopy.

The surface phase transition characteristics of ZrO 2 and ZTA ceramics under different machining methods were tested by X-ray diffraction in the paper. Through the qualitative and quantitative phase analyses, the influences of several different precision machining methods on the phase transitions in the machined surface were studied. Research results show {{that there are more}} transitions from tetragonal phase ZrO 2 to monoclinic phase ZrO 2 in the high speed grinding surface; because of the high-frequency vibration of lapping tool in ultrasonic lapping, the stress condition in the grinding area can be improved and the stable tetragonal phase ZrO 2 in the ultrasonic lapped surface is easy to get.

40|$|Abstract. In free-form <b>surface</b> <b>machining,</b> it is {{essential}} to optimize the feedrate in order to improve the machining efficiency. Conservative constant feedrate values have been mostly used since {{there was a lack of}} physical models and optimization tools for the machining processes. The overall goal of this research is the integration of geometric and mechanistic milling models for force prediction and feedrate scheduling for free-form <b>surface</b> <b>machining.</b> For each tool move a geometric model calculates the cutting geometry parameters, then a mechanistic model uses this information with the constraint force to calculate desired feedrates. The feedrate is written into the part program. When the integrated modeling approach was used, it was shown that the machining time can be decreased significantly along the tool path. Production time in machining propeller example was reduced to 35 % compared to constant feedrate cases...|$|E

Time:APR 26 - 29, 2010. Any {{kinds of}} tiny {{vibration}} of machine tool parts {{will have a}} great influence on surface quality of the workpiece at ultra-precise machining process of aspheric surface. At present the major way for decreasing influence of vibration is machining compensation technology. Therefore {{it is important for}} machining compensation control to acquire and transmit these vibration signals effectively. This paper presents a vibration monitoring system of aspheric <b>surface</b> <b>machining</b> machine tool based on wireless sensor networks (WSN). Some key issues of wireless sensor networks for vibration monitoring system of aspheric <b>surface</b> <b>machining</b> are discussed. The reliability of data transmission, network communication protocol and synchronization mechanism of wireless sensor networks are studied for the vibration monitoring system. The proposed system achieves multi-sensors vibration monitoring involving the grinding wheel, the workpiece and the workbench spindle. The wireless transmission of vibration signals is achieved by the combination with vibration sensor nodes and wireless network. In this paper, these vibration sensor nodes are developed. An experimental platform is structured which employs wireless sensor networks to the vibration monitoring system in order to test acquisition and wireless transmission of vibration signal.

This paper {{presents}} {{findings of}} an experimental work which involved use of wiping edge {{on the cutting}} tool and a priory heating of the work surfaces to improve the integrity of <b>machined</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The wiper edge cleans the <b>machined</b> <b>surface</b> and a priory heating induces necessary local ductility into the <b>machined</b> <b>surface</b> to promote improvement in the surface integrity. The result shows that the wiper inserts reduce surface roughness (by about 38 %); cutting forces (by about 8 %) and induce compressive (or lower tensile) residual stresses in the <b>machined</b> <b>surfaces,</b> hence help to improve the surface integrity. Similarly, a priory heating of work surfaces at 70 ºC was also found to improve <b>machined</b> <b>surface</b> roughness considerably...|$|R

40|$|In {{machining}} of Inconel 718, various difficulties such {{as increased}} tool wear and poor <b>machined</b> <b>surface</b> quality are frequently encountered {{due to its}} high temperature strength and poor thermal properties. This work considers the effect of number of passes and the machining environment on the <b>machined</b> <b>surface</b> quality in ball end milling of Inconel 718, which hitherto has not been adequately understood. To this effect, extensive experimentation {{has been carried out}} to analyze <b>machined</b> <b>surface</b> quality and integrity in terms of surface roughness, surface damage, and microhardness variation in the <b>machined</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The <b>machined</b> <b>surfaces</b> show formation of distinct bands as a function of instantaneous machining parameters along the periphery of cutting tool edge. A distinct variation is also observed in the measured values of surface roughness and microhardness in these regions. The minimum surface roughness is obtained in the stable cutting zone and it increases toward the periphery of the cutter on band # 2 and band # 3. Microhardness of depth beneath the <b>machined</b> <b>surface</b> shows that the machining affected zone varies from 60 to 100 A mu m in ball end milling under various machining conditions...|$|R

30|$|One of the {{purposes}} of wood cutting is to obtain satisfactory <b>machined</b> <b>surface.</b> The <b>machined</b> <b>surface</b> of good quality is considered to be formed when the workpiece is cut exactly at the path of the cutting edge, meaning that the workpiece above the path of the edge is completely removed and no machining defects such as torn grain, fuzzy grain, or any other destructions would be found. In addition, as Scholz et al. [1] mentioned, no compressed cells should be found on and beneath the surface, since they may absorb moisture and swell, causing rough surface. Some studies have been done observing both the <b>machined</b> <b>surface</b> and subsurface structure; although the workpiece was cut at a plane normal to the <b>machined</b> <b>surface</b> to be observed with microscope, so the procedure was destructive and might have changed shapes of cells observed [2 – 4].|$|R
