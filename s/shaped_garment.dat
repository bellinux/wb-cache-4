40|$|Pressure is {{the most}} {{important}} aspect for body <b>shaping</b> <b>garment,</b> among various performance requirements such as moisture transference, softness, elasticity, recovery and skin stimulation. Girdle pant is a typical fashion product of body shapers. In order to achieve the required performance of hip lifting, abdomen reshaping and waist tightening, certain fabric pressure must be applied to the human body. The greater the pressure, the more shaping result can be achieved. However, if the garment is too tight, the human muscles and nerves will receive excessive pressure and blood vessels may be closed. All these will lead to the sensation of tiredness or even pain. This paper explores the comfort boundary towards girdle pressure and determines the corresponding fabric mechanical properties.

40|$|Garments used {{throughout}} the Southern Andean region from the early Pre-Columbian era to at least {{the time of the}} Spanish arrival in the sixteenth century, traditionally were constructed of single or multiple webs of rectangular four-selvaged cloth sometimes folded and seamed, but never cut to shape. As a result, the drape and style of most garments retained the rigid outlines of their originally constructed rectangular format. Sometime during the Late Intermediate Period, along the far south coast of Peru and northern Chile, a different garment style developed. It featured a wide, curving shoulder, tapered sides, and bulging lower edges, and was woven to shape by utilizing unusual technical features. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has in its collection, an exceptional example of this type of garment. It features designs woven with discontinuous warps, as well as warp-patterning, and is an unique example among the corpus.

40|$|Trapezoid <b>shaped</b> <b>garments</b> are {{not common}} in the Andean Pre-Columbian cultures. Generally, men and women wore {{sleeveless}} tunics made from the whole woven fabric without cutting and sewing it into any shape as did the Europeans for instance. The lengths of these tunics ranged from chest to ankle. Often the shorter tunics were complemented by loincloths or skirts. The number of fabrics needed to make these garments would vary: one web folded in half or two or more webs sown together. The warps were hardly ever cut from the loom bar and wefts would be inserted up to the heading cord {{with the use of}} a needle. Thus, in order to make a flaring garment, the fabric itself had to be woven into a trapezoidal shape. In the Chiribaya culture (AD 900 - 1375) in the extreme south of Peru, the flaring tunic was a well known <b>garment</b> <b>shape</b> that would become ever more common and more flaring over time. While studying a part of the archaeological textile collection from the Osmore valley in the extreme south of Peru (1999 - 2002), the author found two different methods of creating such flaring form. Two textiles had been found wrapped around the body of an adult man buried at the Chiribaya section of the site La Cruz. One was a loincloth that had been worn around the groin as it would have been in life; the other, wrapped around the man in a seated, fetal position and also covering his arms and feet, was a tunic, secured by wool ropes. A second flaring tunic, made with entirely different structural and decorative devices, was found at the coastal Chiribaya site of Boca del Río. This second tunic is included here because it seems to form a link between the two textile traditions found in this area...|$|R

Taking the history of London’s garment industry in the post-war 1940 s as a case study, this paper traces the major stages of the making process–pattern making, cutting, machining and finishing–through four garments from the Museum of London’s fashion collection. By understanding these material fashion objects as processes, it uncovers the hidden stories of historic garment workers through the tiny clues left in old stitching, revealing the creativity of the individuals who made them and how they contributed to the creative cultures of the historic fashion city. This study of material processes shows how individual makers <b>shaped</b> <b>garments</b> and contributed to a creative culture that played {{a vital role in}} London's growing post-war reputation as a fashion city. It also broadens the boundaries of London as a fashion city beyond the confines of the West End by revealing that a network of workrooms and factories across the city supported this centrally located cluster of fashion businesses. Having established the historical role of making in the creative cultures of London fashion, this paper concludes by questioning how future studies of contemporary fashion cities might look to material objects in order to reconsider the creative agency of subcontracted garment workers in the new international division of labour and the contributions they make towards the symbolic reputations of major fashion cities, in spite of geographical distances...|$|R
50|$|A style {{line is a}} seam in {{a garment}} made {{primarily}} {{for the purpose of}} its visual effect, rather than for the purpose of shaping of structuring the garment.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Realistic human models are widely used in variety of applications. Much research {{has been carried out}} on improving realism of virtual humans from various aspects, such as body shapes, hair, and facial expressions and so on. In most occasions, these virtual humans need to wear garments. However, it is time-consuming and tedious to dress a human model using current software packages [Maya 2004]. Several methods for dressing virtual humans have been proposed recently [Bourguignon 2001, Turquin 2004, Turquin 2007 and Wang 2003 B]. The method proposed by Bourguignon et al [Bourguignon 2001] can only generate 3 D garment contour instead of 3 D surface. The method presented by Turquin et al. [Turquin 2004, Turquin 2007] could generate various kinds of garments from sketches but their <b>garments</b> followed the <b>shape</b> of the body and the side of a garment looked not convincing because of using simple linear interpolation. The method proposed by Wang et al. [Wang 2003 B] lacked interactivity from users, so users had very limited control on the <b>garment</b> <b>shape.</b> This thesis proposes a framework for dressing virtual humans to obtain convincing dressing results, which overcomes problems existing in previous papers mentioned above by using nonlinear interpolation, level set-based shape modification, feature constraints and so on. Human models used in this thesis are reconstructed from real human body data obtained using a body scanning system. Semantic information is then extracted from human models to assist in generation of 3 dimensional (3 D) garments. The proposed framework allows users to dress virtual humans using garment patterns and sketches. The proposed dressing method is based on semantic virtual humans. A semantic human model is a human body with semantic information represented by certain of structure and body features. The semantic human body is reconstructed from body scanned data from a real human body. After segmenting the human model into six parts some key features are extracted. These key features are used as constraints for garment construction. Simple 3 D garment patterns are generated using the techniques of sweep and offset. To dress a virtual human, users just choose a garment pattern, which is put on the human body at the default position with a default size automatically. Users are allowed to change simple parameters to specify some sizes of a garment by sketching the desired position on the human body. To enable users to dress virtual humans by their own design styles in an intuitive way, this thesis proposes an approach for garment generation from user-drawn sketches. Users can directly draw sketches around reconstructed human bodies and then generates 3 D garments based on user-drawn strokes. Some techniques for generating 3 D garments and dressing virtual humans are proposed. The specific focus of the research lies in generation of 3 D geometric <b>garments,</b> <b>garment</b> <b>shape</b> modification, local <b>shape</b> modification, <b>garment</b> surface processing and decoration creation. A sketch-based interface has been developed allowing users to draw garment contour representing the front-view <b>shape</b> of a <b>garment,</b> and the system can generate a 3 D geometric garment surface accordingly. To improve realism of a garment surface, this thesis presents three methods as follows. Firstly, the procedure of garment vertices generation takes key body features as constraints. Secondly, an optimisation algorithm is carried out after generation of garment vertices to optimise positions of garment vertices. Finally, some mesh processing schemes are applied to further process the garment surface. Then, an elaborate 3 D geometric garment surface can be obtained through this series of processing. Finally, this thesis proposes some modification and editing methods. The user-drawn sketches are processed into spline curves, which allow users to modify the existing <b>garment</b> <b>shape</b> by dragging the control points into desired positions. This makes it easy for users to obtain a more satisfactory <b>garment</b> <b>shape</b> compared with the existing one. Three decoration tools including a 3 D pen, a brush and an embroidery tool, are provided letting users decorate the garment surface by adding some small 3 D details such as brand names, symbols and so on. The prototype of the framework is developed using Microsoft Visual Studio C++,OpenGL and GPU programming...|$|R

An answer to the research question was formed by re-instating the designer-maker at the centre of the development process in order to reconnect the cloth with the body, as well as the cloth with the making practice. This resulted in a system of patternmaking, which is referred to as ?The Cube Method?.
