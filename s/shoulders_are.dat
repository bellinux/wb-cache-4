5|$|Pugs' {{legs are}} strong, straight, of {{moderate}} length, and are set well under. Their <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> moderately laid back. Their ankles are strong, their feet are small, their toes are well split-up, and their nails are black. The lower teeth normally protrude further than their upper, {{resulting in an}} under-bite.|$|E
5|$|Many Gobioolithus minor {{specimens}} contain embryonic {{remains of}} the enantiornithine genus Gobipipus. The embryos have well-ossified skeletons, implying that they were at a late stage in development when they died. Their wings and <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> especially well-developed. Only the modern megapodes and the little tern exhibit a comparable degree of embryonic ossification in the arm and shoulder bones. It is likely that Gobipipus hatchlings, like megapodes and little terns, {{would be able to}} fly very soon after hatching.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} is {{distinguished}} from the black-throated loon (G. arctica) and the red-throated loon (G. stellata) mainly by its larger size. It usually has a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is heavier and the back is paler than its hindneck. It {{is more difficult to}} separate from the yellow-billed loon, but its breeding plumage has more white markings on the neck and the squares on its <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more sharply with pale areas and bill colour.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Shoulder</b> Drop <b>is</b> {{performed}} {{in a similar manner}} to the Classic Push Up, but one <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> lowered to the ground as the opposite <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> raised high in the air.|$|R

50|$|Anterior {{shoulder}} in obstetrics refers to that {{shoulder of the}} fetus that faces the pubic symphysis of the mother during delivery. Depending upon the original position of the fetus, either the left or the right <b>shoulder</b> can <b>be</b> the anterior <b>shoulder.</b> It <b>is</b> known as the anterior shoulder as it faces the anterior of the mother. This distinction between the anterior and the posterior <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> important as the anterior <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> delivered first.|$|R
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact {{dog that}} gives the {{impression}} of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.|$|E
5|$|The head is well-proportioned {{and similar}} to that of the Selle Francais, with wide nostrils, small ears and a {{straight}} or convex facial profile. The neck is thick, muscular and arched. The mane is sometimes roached. The <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> broad and angled, the chest deep and the withers pronounced. The body is compact and stocky, with a short, strong back. The hindquarters are powerful, although not so much as in heavy draft breeds, and the croup muscular and sloping. The legs are short, muscular and strong, with thick bone, but less massive than most draft breeds. The feet are round, wide and solid.|$|E
5|$|The plumage is {{generally}} light gray-brown and lighter and pinkish below. The wings have black spotting, {{and the outer}} tail feathers are white, contrasting with the black inners. Below the eye is a distinctive crescent-shaped area of dark feathers. The eyes are dark, with light skin surrounding them. The adult male has bright purple-pink patches on the neck sides, with light pink coloring reaching the breast. The crown of the adult male is a distinctly bluish-grey color. Females are similar in appearance, but with more brown coloring overall and a little smaller than the male. The iridescent feather patches on the neck above the <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> nearly absent, but can be quite vivid on males. Juvenile birds have a scaly appearance, and are generally darker.|$|E
5000|$|A hard <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} called an emergency lane or a breakdown lane, {{when it is}} reserved for vehicle breakdowns, and for emergency vehicles. On some congested roads, the <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> used as a vehicle lane during peak travel hours.|$|R
50|$|Posterior {{shoulder}} in obstetrics {{refers to the}} shoulder of the fetus other than the anterior shoulder. Thus, the posterior shoulder faces the rectum of the mother during delivery. Whether left or the right shoulder becomes the posterior <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> dependent upon the original position of the fetus. It is known as the posterior shoulder as it faces the posterior of the mother. This distinction between the anterior and the posterior <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> important as the anterior <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> delivered first.|$|R
50|$|The lateral fibers perform basic {{shoulder}} abduction {{when the}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> internally rotated, and perform shoulder transverse abduction when the <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> externally rotated. They are not utilized significantly during strict transverse extension (shoulder internally rotated) {{such as in}} rowing movements, which use the posterior fibers.|$|R
5|$|The red-capped robin (Petroica goodenovii) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{native to}} Australia. Found in drier regions {{across much of the}} continent, it inhabits scrub and open woodland. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family Petroicidae, it is sexually dimorphic. Measuring 10.5–12.5cm (4–5in) in length, the robin has a small thin black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to advertise territories and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.|$|E
5|$|Kata is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the posture and movement associated with taiko performance. The term is used in martial arts in a similar way: for example, both traditions include the idea that the hara is the center of being. Author Sean Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another, and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance. For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players. An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing, and can be accomplished by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee bent over the toes and keeping the right leg straight. It is important that the hips face the drum and the <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> relaxed. Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing, and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.|$|E
5|$|The head is {{long and}} strong, with a convex profile and thick, long ears. The neck {{is long and}} the <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> sloping. The chest is broad and deep, the withers prominent, the back long and broad, and the {{hindquarters}} strong. The legs are well developed and powerful, with large joints. The Poitevin has large hooves, an advantage in wet environments, as an adaptation to the alternately hard and waterlogged marshes upon which it developed. The lower legs are well feathered, and the mane and tail are long and thick. The Poitevin is gentle, calm and robust. Historically the breed {{has been known for}} its slow movement and disinterest in pulling, although it can produce significant power if necessary. The breed enjoys human contact, and shows intelligence, although it can also be stubborn. Prolonged effort is its weak point, as the Poitevin sometimes lack endurance.|$|E
5000|$|Verse 22 {{names the}} next feudatory ruler as Ayushchandra, {{the son of}} Alhana. It states that Anayachandra's <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> [...] "tireless <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> like safety latches" [...] for the {{stability}} of Govindachandra's kingdom. (According to K. V. Ramesh's reading, this expression refers to Alhana, not Ayushchandra.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Phobia {{looks much}} like her sister, but has an {{extended}} proboscis and live heads as earrings.

50|$|Discomfort {{with the}} <b>shoulder</b> blade <b>is</b> also {{extremely}} common in Erb's palsy as the <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> often {{at risk of}} dislocation. This can result, again, in sickness or lack of sleep.|$|R
5|$|The adult green rosella has {{a yellow}} head and underparts with blue cheeks and red band on the {{forehead}} and upper lores. The yellow feathers of the forecrown, lower lores, cheeks, chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow feathers of the sides and rear {{of the head and}} neck, and the underparts have dark brown bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint scalloping, which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow feathers of the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow {{of the back of the}} head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or dark brown with green margins. The feathers of the <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> blackish with yellow tips. These margins and tips are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more solid black. The blue-violet feathers of the chin, throat and cheeks have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers and tips. The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted dark brown primaries and outer secondaries. Underneath the feathers of the wings are dark brown with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent.|$|E
5|$|The site is moated {{and lies}} {{immediately}} {{west of the}} village of Dunham, with its deer park to the south. The hall was donated to the National Trust by Roger Grey, 10th and last Earl of Stamford in 1976. The hall {{was used as a}} military hospital during the First World War. Inside is a significant collection of Huguenot silver, the carving The Crucifixion by 17th-century wood carver Grinling Gibbons, and a white marble bust of the Emperor Hadrian; the head is antique, but the neck and <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> 18th-century; it was probably acquired by the George, Earl of Stamford and Warrington. The hall's collection of paintings include Allegory with Venus, Mars, Cupid and Time by Guercino; The Cascade at Terni by Louis Ducros; and portraits by William Beechey, Francis Cotes, Michael Dahl, A. R. Mengs, Sir Joshua Reynolds, George Romney, Enoch Seeman, and Zoffany. George Harry, Earl of Stamford and Warrington removed a selection of paintings to Enville Hall in the late-1850s, and it was not until Roger Grey, 10th Earl of Stamford succeeded as Earl, that some were rebought by the family after sales in 1929 and 1931. The deer park is the only surviving medieval park in Trafford or the surrounding area. The hall and grounds {{are open to the public}} and are a popular tourist attraction, with 340,000 visitors in 2014.|$|E

25|$|A {{dead man}} is {{prepared}} {{by his wife}} for the wake, known in Ilocano as the bagongon. Typically, only the wife will clothe the corpse, believing {{that the spirit of}} the dead man can convey messages through her. There are many customs and beliefs that are followed, such as coffin placement, lighting a wooden log in front of the house, chanting while crying (dung-aw), in order to give the deceased one respects and ensuring a safe travel to heaven. During the wake, immediate family members of the deceased one are not allowed to work, cook, or carry heavy objects. The ceremonial attire of female mourners for the vigil is black clothing, while their heads and <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> covered in a black veil called a manto.|$|E

25|$|The Murciélago is an all-wheel drive, {{mid-engined}} supersports car. With an angular {{design and}} an exceptionally low slung body, {{the highest point}} of the roof is just under 4 feet above the ground. One of the vehicle's most distinguishing features are its scissor doors. which lends to the extreme image. First-generation Murciélagos, produced between 2001 and 2006, were powered by a Lamborghini V12 that traces its roots back to the company's beginnings in the 1960s. The rear differential is integrated with the engine itself, with a viscous coupling center differential providing drive to the front wheels. Power is delivered through a 6-speed manual transmission. The Murciélago suspension uses an independent double-wishbone design, and bodywork features carbon fiber, steel and aluminum parts. The rear spoiler and the active air intakes integrated into the car's <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> electromechanically controlled, deploying automatically only at high speeds {{in an effort to}} maximize both aerodynamic and cooling efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Tea Time is an oil {{painting}} on cardboard with dimensions 75.9 x 70.2cm (29.9 x 27.6 in), signed Metzinger and dated 1911 lower right. The painting represents a barely draped (nude) woman holding a spoon, {{seated at a}} table with a cup of tea. In the 'background', the upper left quadrant, stands a vase on a commode, table or shelf. A square or cubic shape, a chair or painting behind the model, espouses the shape of the stretcher. The painting is practically square, like the side of a cube. The woman's head is highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves (the forehead, nose, cheeks, hair). The source of light appears to be off to her right, with some reflected light {{on the left side of}} her face. Reflected light, consistently, can be seen on other parts of her body (breast, shoulder, arm). Her breast is composed of a triangle and a sphere. The faceting of the rest of her body, to some extent, coincides with actual muscular and skeletal features (collar bone, ribcage, pectorals, deltoids, neck tissue). Both of here <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> coupled with elements of the background, superimposed, gradational and transparent to varying degrees. Unidentified elements are composed of alternating angular structures, The colors employed by Metzinger are subdued, mixed (either on a palette of directly on the surface), with an overall natural allure. The brushwork is reminiscent of Metzinger's Divisionist period (ca. 1903–1907), described by the critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as large, mosaic-like 'cubes', used to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.|$|E
