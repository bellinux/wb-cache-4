40|$|AbstractA milling {{operation}} is inherently an intermittent material removal process where cutter engagement and disengagement is repeated {{until the end}} of the material removal process. During the process, the cutter receives multiple impacts and mechanical and thermal vibrations which eventually damage the cutting edge. The optimum rigidity and damping of the spindle motor for the least tool damage highly depends on the cutter and workpiece material properties and the cutting application. This paper introduces the concept of flexible rotational rigidity control using a high performance Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) which is used as a direct spindle drive. With the PMSM spindle, the spindle rotational characteristics can be adjusted for optimizing the cutting process in order to prevent tools from unwanted premature damage. Simulation models of the <b>spindle</b> motor drive <b>system</b> are presented, which show that a very stiff spindle can be realized by fully utilizing the potential capability of the PMSM and a spindle with the same dynamic properties of a conventionally used induction motor can be realized with a single PMSM <b>spindle.</b> The <b>system</b> prototype and feasibility studies are also presented in this paper. The experimental results show that the PMSM spindle characteristics behave differently depending on the controller setting, and the <b>spindle</b> motor drive <b>system</b> rotational characteristics greatly affect the cutting process, which confirms the importance of the flexible motor control concept...|$|R

Thus, when <b>spindle</b> <b>systems</b> are designed and their dynamic stiffness is important, {{it is very difficult to}} find suitable characteristics to use in the modelling.

In the 1980 s, some models were developed, but these were in confidential, limited-circulation publications. However, per-mission has now been given to present these models in the open literature. The principles of a rig are described that allow the stiffness and damping properties of rolling-element bearings to be measured under rotating conditions. A theoretical analysis is presented that allows the characteristics of the rolling contacts to be predicted. In addition, the effect of the necessary joints that arise when using bearings is analysed. A detailed description is given of the rig and its initial calibration and testing.
