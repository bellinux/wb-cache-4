25|$|The 2007 {{model year}} {{marked the first}} time the S2000 was offered in more than one trim level in the United States. In {{addition}} to the base model, Honda offered a more track-oriented version of the S2000, distinguished by reduced weight, fewer amenities, and an increase in performance. The S2000 Club Racer made its world debut at the New York International Auto Show on 4 April 2007. Changes for the CR included a lower ratio steering rack, revised exhaust system, black lug nuts, darker colored wheels, clear side markers, stiffer suspension and new Bridgestone Potenza RE070 tires that were wider at the rear; 245/40R-17 to 255/40R-17. A revised body kit, composed of a redesigned front lip, and a large spoiler, were wind-tunnel tested and claimed to reduce the overall coefficient of lift by 70–80%. The power folding soft top was removed and replaced with additional chassis bracing topped off with a tonneau cover, while the hard top, optional on other models, became a standard feature on the CR. Honda also revised the <b>shift</b> <b>knob</b> over the base with an exclusive spherical aluminum <b>shift</b> <b>knob</b> that rests 12.6mm lower for a 6 percent reduction in shift stroke compared to the conventional S2000 cylindrical <b>shift</b> <b>knob</b> (aluminum/leather wrapped).

30|$|The above focused beam {{position}} {{change and}} beam scanning {{have been achieved}} by adjusting the x–y <b>shift</b> <b>knobs</b> of the TEM instrument. For Fig.  1 a, {{to get a good}} dot position separation, 3 coarse shift steps have been made for each beam position change, and the transient beam left some much smaller nanodots (~ 20 – 30  nm sized) between the labeled larger dots.

5000|$|The Snow Trac {{is made up}} {{largely of}} off the shelf {{automotive}} and industrial parts supplied by Volkswagen including an air cooled flat 4 industrial version of VW Beetle engine, a VW Bus transmission, and hundreds of surplus parts including steering wheels, <b>shift</b> <b>knobs,</b> and lighting components. A proprietary drive variator was adapted to the transmission to allow {{the use of a}} steering wheel to control the tracks. The variator steplessly changes the speed of the left and right tracks, accelerating one track while slowing the other to effect a turn. Unlike traditional tracked vehicle steering, the brakes are not used to turn, increasing efficiency and reducing brake wear. Production of the air cooled VW engine ceased in 1981 in Europe and this effectively led to the demise of the Snow Trac, which ended factory production in Sweden.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} localization and transgene expression from adenoviral vector of serotypes 5, 35, and 28, 6 an RGD motif in {{the fiber}} following intravitreal or subretinal administration. Methods: Ocular transduction by adenoviral vector serotypes 6 RGD was {{studied in the}} eyes of mice receiving an intravitreous or subretinal injection. Each serotype expressed a CMV-GFP expression cassette and histological sections of eyes were examined. Transgene expression levels were examined using luciferase (Luc) regulated by the CMV promoter. Results: GFP localization studies revealed that serotypes 5 and 28 given intravitreously transduced corneal endothelial, trabecular, and iris cells. Intravitreous delivery of the unmodified Ad 35 serotype transduced only trabecular meshwork cells, but, the modification of the RGD motif into the fiber of the Ad 35 viral vector base expanded transduction to corneal endothelial and iris cells. Incorporation of the RGD motif into the fiber knob with deletion of RGD from the penton base did not affect the transduction ability of the Ad 5 vector base. Subretinal studies showed that RGD in the Ad 5 <b>knob</b> <b>shifted</b> transduction from RPE cells to photoreceptor cells. Using a CMV-Luc expression cassette, intravitreous delivery of all the tested vectors, such as Ad 5 -, Ad 35 - and Ad 28 - resulted in an initial rapid induction of luciferase activity that thereafter declined. Subretinal administration of vectors showed a marked difference in transgene activity. Ad 35 -Luc gene expression peaked at 7 days and remained elevated for 6 months. Ad 28 -Luc expression was high after 1 day and remained sustaine...|$|R
