Also, it’s worth mentioning that in windy weather, the canopy of the control trees was covered with plastic sheet to avoid <b>spray</b> <b>drifting</b> from treated trees. Neem oil and abamectin, as two positive controls, were used at the recommended dose of 0.1  μl/ 100  ml and 0.03  ml/ 100  ml, respectively.

A vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (VUV-ATOFMS) and an atmospheric gas analysis mass spectrometer were synchronously used to online monitor the decays of particulate ametryn and gas-phase isoprene. The reactive uptake coefficient of NO 3 radicals on ametryn particles was calculated to be 2. 9 x 10 (- 2), according to the measured ametryn loss ratio and the average NO 3 concentration. The effective rate constant for the heterogeneous reaction of particulate ametryn with NO 3 radicals measured under experimental conditions was 8. 4 x 10 (- 13) cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{reduction}} of pesticide <b>spraying</b> <b>drift</b> {{is still one}} of the major challenges in Brazilian agriculture. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of different adjuvant products, such as surfactants, drift retardants, mineral oil and vegetable oil for reducing <b>drift</b> in agricultural <b>spraying.</b> The experiment consisted of quantifying drift of sprayings of 18 adjuvants dissolved in water under controlled conditions in a wind tunnel. Tests were performed in triplicates with spraying nozzles type Teejet XR 8003 VK, pressure of 200 kPa and medium drops. Solutions sprayed were marked with Brilliant Blue dye at 0. 6 % (m v- 1). The drift was collected using polyethylene strips transversally fixed along the tunnel at different distances from the nozzle and different heights from the bottom part of the tunnel. Drift deposits were evaluated by spectrophotometry in order to quantify deposits. The adjuvants from chemical groups of mineral oil and drift retardant resulted in lower values of drift in comparison with surfactants and water. The results obtained in laboratory show that the selection of appropriate class and concentration of adjuvants can significantly decrease the risk of <b>drift</b> in agricultural <b>spraying.</b> However, the best results obtained in laboratory should be validated with pesticide under field conditions in the future...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Glyphosate is used {{to control}} weeds in citrus orchards, and {{accidental}} <b>spraying</b> or wind <b>drift</b> onto the seedlings may cause growth arrest owing to metabolism disturbance. Two experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of non-lethal rates (0, 180, 360 and 720 g Al ha(- 1)) of glyphosate on four-month-old `Cravo` lime, Citrus limonia (L.) Osbeck, seedlings. Photosynthesis and the concentrations of shikimic acid, total free amino acids and phenolic acids were evaluated. RESULTS: Only transitory effects were observed in the! contents of shikimate and total free amino acids. No visual effects were observed. CONCLUSION: The present study showed that glyphosate at non-lethal rates, which is very usual when accidental <b>spraying</b> or wind <b>drift</b> occurs in citrus orchard, did not cause severe metabolic damage in `Cravo` lime seedlings.

Only two of the extant stands are in uncleared areas, the rest occur on cleared land, or weedy verges. No natural increase in plant numbers, totalling fewer than 1000 mature individuals, has been observed since the populations have been monitored. It is believed that inbreeding has resulted in weaker plants with reduced reproductive capacity. Although unauthorised seed collection from roadside plants {{has occurred in the}} past, this practice is now less common.

50|$|One of {{the most}} common forms of {{pesticide}} application, especially in conventional agriculture, is the use of mechanical sprayers. Hydraulic sprayers consists of a tank, a pump, a lance (for single nozzles) or boom, and a nozzle (or multiple nozzles). Sprayers convert a pesticide formulation, often containing a mixture of water (or another liquid chemical carrier, such as fertilizer) and chemical, into droplets, which can be large rain-type drops or tiny almost-invisible particles. This conversion is accomplished by forcing the spray mixture through a spray nozzle under pressure. The size of droplets can be altered through the use of different nozzle sizes, or by altering the pressure under which it is forced, or a combination of both. Large droplets have the advantage of being less susceptible to <b>spray</b> <b>drift,</b> but require more water per unit of land covered. Due to static electricity, small droplets are able to maximize contact with a target organism, but very still wind conditions are required.|$|E
5000|$|Pesticides can {{contribute}} to air pollution. Pesticide drift occurs when pesticides suspended {{in the air as}} particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them. Pesticides that are applied to crops can volatilize and may be blown by winds into nearby areas, potentially posing a threat to wildlife. Weather conditions at the time of application as well as temperature and relative humidity change the spread of the pesticide in the air. As wind velocity increases so does the <b>spray</b> <b>drift</b> and exposure. Low relative humidity and high temperature result in more spray evaporating. The amount of inhalable pesticides in the outdoor environment is therefore often dependent on the season. Also, droplets of sprayed pesticides or particles from pesticides applied as dusts may travel on the wind to other areas, or pesticides may adhere to particles that blow in the wind, such as dust particles. [...] Ground spraying produces less pesticide drift than aerial spraying does. [...] Farmers can employ a buffer zone around their cro ...|$|E
40|$|The aerial {{application}} of mosquito adulticides {{is an important}} part of many mosquito control programs’ IPM approach. For some it is the only effective method for dealing with large migratory populations of mosquitoes. Mosquito adulticides are applied as aerosols over large areas of 10, 000 to 50, 000 acres with diverse habitats, with the intent of drifting through these target zones. Much research has been conducted for these adulticides, primarily in laboratory wind tunnels and small scale field trials, and all indicate 5 to 30 microns as the optimum droplet size range. Mosquito adulticides are applied as space sprays to treat the air column in which mosquitoes are active, not deposit sprays treating surfaces on which they might feed or alight. As space <b>sprays,</b> <b>drift</b> of these drops is desirable since it keeps the pesticide available to contact actively flying mosquitoes, whereas deposit of the drops is undesirable as it removes the pesticide from impacting the mosquitoes. There is no standard, or guidance on labels, for many of the operational parameters in aerial adulticiding applications such as spray altitude or swath width. This results in an extremely wide variation in peak deposits and spray cloud concentrations that could reasonably be expected to result from different aerial adulticide applications. Due to the nature of the application and the reliance on local meteorology to disperse the spray cloud, significant off-target drift could be expected. Much research on optimum droplet size, efficacy and long distance drift and deposit from operational aerial applications remains to be completed...|$|R
