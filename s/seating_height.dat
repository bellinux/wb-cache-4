Design: Laboratory-based study. Subjects: Twelve persons {{with spinal cord injury}} (age range 19 – 77 years, lesion level: C 5 /C 6 –L 2; 7 men; 8 incomplete). Methods: Subjects conducted 8 submaximal hand rim wheel-chair exercise tests (4 min) on a computerized ergometer at 8 <b>seat</b> <b>heights</b> (elbow angle: 70 – 140 °, full extension = 180 °) in a counter-balanced order (individualized fixed power out-put (5. 4 – 13. 9 W) and speed). Last-minute physiological and technique parameters were evaluated using repeated meas-ures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multilevel regression analysis (p < 0. 05). Results: Physical strain and mechanical efficiency changed significantly (p < 0. 05) with <b>seat</b> <b>height,</b> with optimal values at 100 – 130 °. Lower <b>seat</b> <b>heights</b> were clearly detrimental. Forces on the hand rims were affected by <b>seat</b> <b>height,</b> show-ing lower forces with increasing <b>seat</b> <b>height.</b> Lesion level was not a confounder of <b>seat</b> <b>height</b> with respect to mechanical efficiency, oxygen uptake or fraction effective force.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this project is to provide information pertaining to changes in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> due to spinal elongation in a microgravity environment. The proposed experiment aims to collect <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> data for subjects exposed to microgravity environments, provide information relating to <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> rate of change over time, and feed new information regarding the elongation of the spine forward into the design of Constellation systems. Historical data indicates that spinal elongation occurs when crewmembers are subjected to microgravity. In as little as two days, the typical crewmember will exhibit increases in stature of up to 3 percent. However, data has been collected only for crewmembers in standing postures, and a limited pool of subjects was available. Due to the criticality of <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> {{in the design of}} the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), a better understanding of the effects of microgravity on <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> is necessary. Small changes in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> that may not have impacted crew accommodation in previous programs will have significant effects on crew accommodation due to the layout of seats in the CEV. The proposed study will directly measure changes in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> for crewmembers in the Shuttle cockpit. An anthropometer will be used to record measurements to the top of the head of a seated subject, and an orthogonal photograph will be taken in order to measure <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> based on scaling references of known sizes as well as verify the posture and positioning remained consistent throughout the study.

40|$|Within this {{experimental}} study, {{we compare}} the anchorage stability of 3 {{state of the}} art press-fit cups to a press-fit design with 6 additional radially arranged, curved fins called Ana. Nova® cup. Method: The 4 types of press-fit cups (Ana. Nova® [ImplanTec], Allofit® [Zimmer], Reflection® [Smith & Nephew], Monoblock [Zimmer]) are pressed into rigid polyurethane foam, a test medium for human cancellous bone produced by Sawbones®. The reaming of the cavity in the foam is performed using a common surgery reamer with required diameter. The cups are pressed into the cavity until they reach the desired <b>seating</b> <b>height</b> of 0 -, 2 - or 4 mm. Afterwards a force is applied vertically {{on the rim of the}} cups until loosening or outbreaking occurs. The required load is recorded and the results are statistically evaluated. Results: The highest primary stability for every tested cup is registered at seating heights of 0 mm and 2 mm. At insufficient seating heights of 4 mm, we find a strongly decreased stability in the process of loosening and outbreaking. The Allofit®-, Reflection®- and Monoblock cups are showing similar patterns of behaviour for loosening at every <b>seating</b> <b>height.</b> The 6 -finned Ana. Nova® cup requires more power for loosening and outbreaking than the regular press-fit cups at every <b>seating</b> <b>height.</b> The maximum difference between the Ana. Nova® cup and the conventional cups occurs during outbreaking at insufficient <b>seating</b> <b>height</b> of 4 mm. The results of this experimental study indicate a high primary stability of the Ana. Nova® cup at regular and insufficient seating heights. The empiric set-up restricts the possibility of statistical interpretation, however there is a potential of an explorative interpretation. Evaluation of results: The design of the Ana. Nova® hybrid cup provides a higher anchorage stability. This may base upon the 6 additional fins. Most likely, these fins intrude the acetabular bone and hence influence the periacetabular structure more than the conventional press-fit cups. This might lead to increased bone loss in comparison to conventional press-fit cups, which is not further discussed throughout this study but could be of interest for future research. Recommendation: It’s possible that the Ana. Nova® cup shows a high primary stability and deep anchoring in the subchondral bone in vivo. Potentially the Ana. Nova® cup offers an alternative in case of reduced bone quality, pathological configured acetabula, the revision of hip joint alloarthroplasty and osteoporotic bone conditions...|$|E

40|$|An {{ultralight}} manual wheelchair {{that allows}} users to independently adjust rear <b>seat</b> <b>height</b> and backrest angle during normal everyday usage was recently commercialized. Prior research has been performed on wheelchair tilt, recline, and seat elevation use in the community, however no such {{research has been done}} on this new class of manual ultralight wheelchair with "on the fly" adjustments. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate and characterize the use of the two adjustable seating functions available on the Elevation™ ultralight dynamic wheelchair during its use in the community. Eight participants had data loggers installed onto their own wheelchair for seven days to measure rear <b>seat</b> <b>height,</b> backrest angle position, occupied sitting time, and distance traveled. Analysis of rear <b>seat</b> <b>height</b> and backrest adjustment data revealed considerable variability in the frequency of use and positions used by participants. There was a wide spread of mean daily rear <b>seat</b> <b>heights</b> among participants, from 34. 1 cm to 46. 7 cm. Two sub-groups of users were further identified: those who sat habitually at a single typical rear <b>seat</b> <b>height,</b> and those who varied their rear <b>seat</b> <b>height</b> more continuously. Findings also showed that participants used the rear <b>seat</b> <b>height</b> adjustment feature significantly more often than the backrest adjustment feature. This obvious contrast in feature use may indicate that new users of this class of wheelchair may benefit from specific training. While the small sample size and exploratory nature of this study limit the generalizability of our results, our findings offer a first look at how active wheelchairs users are using a new class of ultralight wheelchair with "on the fly" seating adjustments in their communities.

40|$|The {{current study}} is a review of our {{previous}} papers with certain improvements, so it proves the hypothesis that passenger vehicles are still not sufficiently adapted to man in terms of ergonomics, especially from the aspect of interior space. In the ergonomic adjustment of passenger vehicles, the limits of anthropomeasures and technical limitations, are the most important. The methodology mainly uses operative investigations, and the 'man-vehicle' system is optimized within existing limitations. Here, we also explain original methodology for modeling that space. The {{fact that there is}} a point ' 0 ' as the origin point of a coordinate system with x, y and z axes of the man-vehicle system, which can be considered to be more or less fixed, enabled us to determine more accurately the mechanical and mathematical codependence in this system. The paper also proves that the anthropomeasures of length have mechanical and mathematical functions which also determine the width, i. e. all three dimensions and provides the design of the space behind the windscreen glass, the position of the steering wheel and the position of the foot commands with space for feet and knees determined, as well as the total space which the driver occupies. It is proved that the floor-ceiling height of a vehicle is primarily affected by the anthropomeasures of <b>seating</b> <b>height</b> and lower leg, while width is affected by the anthropomeasures of lower and upper leg and only then by shoulder width, so that the interior space for the driver of a passenger vehicle is 1250 mm and the width for knees spread at seat level is 926 mm maximum...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to provide input into {{knowledge-based}} expert systems by providing mean wind speed at the entire pedestrian level street width. The air flow around an individual building is complex. Around two or more buildings it is even more complicated, a recirculating flow can occur in the street canyon between them. Such urban flows can introduce high wind speeds at pedestrian height inside the street canyon, causing discomfort or even injuries. A fundamental study using the steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations has been performed to analyze the flow pattern and pedestrian comfort inside uniform and non-uniform street canyons for medium rise buildings inside a thick atmospheric boundary layer. For the uniform street canyon study, street width to building height aspect ratios considered (S/H) were 0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 7, 0. 8, 0. 9 and 1. 0 whereas for the non-uniform cases the ratio S/H was kept constant with a value of 1. The Reynolds number involved in this study was 8. 1 × 10 ^ 6 based on the height of the building and free stream velocity. This study reveals that for the uniform street canyon cases pedestrian comfort near the downwind building decreases with increasing street width. At S/H = 1, the region of approximately 20 - 30 % of the width of the canyon at the pedestrian level <b>seating</b> <b>height</b> is in the danger zone for pedestrians.

We exemplify visualization in requirements assessment for an automotive interior cockpit unit and for the layout of a ride-on lawn mower. Visualized structure and behavior are then related to the product model and so-called organ units. We choose {{to make use of}} open-source VR - Open Scene Graph - that has optimum real-time performance, up-to-date rendering, and work on simple workstations. One example is the visualization of issues which influence <b>seating</b> <b>height.</b> The optimum seat position and preferred height above the engine are critical dimensions in this case, shown in Figure 2. It is therefore important to show how these should be varied in direction and amount as done here. The "optimum seat position" requirement is then related to the ergonomic function "Support pelvis" while the "preferred height" requirement is an iib relation from the engine to the "Support pelvis" function. Another example treats requirements on a passive knee absorber. It is important in this case to show the areas covered by active and passive protection and the interval of initial knee speed. We suggest here colored fields which show likelihood of impact position of the knees for a certain body size, so that the structure stiffness can be optimized and any conflicts with other functionality such as storage can be characterized.

Thirteen healthy young women (age: 23. 1 ± 2. 6 years, height: 1. 61 ± 0. 06 m, body mass: 51. 9 ± 7. 4 kg·m- 2) participated in four incremental sit-to-stand tests with different <b>seat</b> <b>heights</b> and cycle tests in random order. The <b>seat</b> <b>heights</b> were adjusted to 100 %, 80 %, 120 %, and 140 % of knee height distance (100 %, 80 %, 120 %, and 140 % incremental sit-to-stand exercise, respectively). The peak VO 2 and completion time were measured during incremental sit-to-stand and cycle ergometer tests, and repeated-measures analysis of variance and Student’s paired t-test with Holm’s method were used to evaluate differences between these variables. The peak VO 2 values increased by about 10 - 12 mL·min- 1 ·kg- 1 as the <b>seat</b> <b>height</b> on the ISTS decreased over a 60 % range of lower leg lengths. The peak VO 2 values on the 80 %, 100 %, 120 %, and 140 % incremental sit-to-stand tests were about 11 %, 25 %, 40 %, and 50 % lower than that on the cycle ergometer test, respectively. The peak VO 2 on the incremental sit-to-stand test increased as <b>seat</b> <b>height</b> decreased. These findings are useful to determine which <b>seat</b> <b>height</b> on the incremental sit-to-stand tests test is suitable for different populations...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Many {{physiological}} factors, such as spinal elongation, fluid shifts, bone atrophy, {{and muscle}} loss, occur during an {{exposure to a}} microgravity environment. Spinal elongation {{is just one of}} the factors that can also affect the safety and performance of a crewmember while in space. Spinal elongation occurs due to the lack of gravity/compression on the spinal column. This allows for the straightening of the natural spinal curve. There is a possible fluid shift in the inter-vertebral disks that may also result in changes in height. This study aims at collecting the overall change in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> for crewmembers exposed to a microgravity environment. During previous Programs, Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) and Skylab, spinal elongation data was collected from a small number of subjects in a standing posture but were limited in scope. Data from these studies indicated a quick increase in stature during the first few days of weightlessness, after which stature growth reached a plateau resulting in up to a 3 % increase of the original measurement [1 - 5]. However, this data was collected only for crewmembers in standing posture and not in a <b>seated</b> posture. <b>Seated</b> <b>height</b> may have a different effect than standing height due to a change in posture as well as due to a compounded effect of wearing restraints and a potential compression of the gluteal area. <b>Seated</b> <b>height</b> was deemed as a critical measurement in the design of the Constellation Program s (CxP) Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), called Orion which is now the point-of-departure vehicle for the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Program; therefore a better understanding of the effects of microgravity on <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> is necessary. Potential changes in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> that may not have impacted crew accommodation in previous Programs will have significant effects on crew accommodation due to the layout of seats in the Orion [...] The current and existing configuration is such that the four crewmembers are stacked two by two with the commander and pilot seats on the top and the two remaining seats underneath, thereby limiting the amount of clearance for the crewmembers seated in the bottom seat. The inner mold line of these types of vehicles are fixed due to other design constraints; therefore, it is essential that all seats incorporate additional clearance to account for adequate spinal growth thereby ensuring that the crew can safely ingress the seat and be strapped in prior to its return to earth. If there is not enough clearance to account for spinal growth deltas between seats then there is the potential that crewmembers will not be able to comfortably and safely fit into their seats. The crewmember in the bottom stacked seat may even have negative clearance with the seat above him or her which could lead to potential ingress/egress issues or potentially injury of the crewmember during landing. These impacts are specific to these types of vehicles with stacked seat configuration. Without proper knowledge of the amount of spinal elongation, or growth, which occurs due to microgravity and space flight, the design of future vehicle(s) or suits may cause injury, discomfort, and limit crew accommodation and crew complements. The experiment primarily aimed to collect <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> data for subjects exposed to microgravity environments, and feed new information regarding the effect of elongation of the spine forward into the design of the Orion. The data collected during the experiment included, two <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> measurement and two digital pictures of <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> pre-, in-, and post-flight. In addition to <b>seated</b> <b>height,</b> crewmembers had an optional task of collecting stature, standing <b>height.</b> <b>Seated</b> <b>height</b> data was obtained from 29 crewmembers that included 8 ISS increment crew (2 females and 6 males) and 21 Shuttle crew (1 female, 20 males), and whose mean age was 48 years (4 years). This study utilized the last six Shuttle flights, STS- 128 to STS- 134. The results show that partipating crewmembers experienced growth up to 6 % in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> and up to 3 % in stature. Based on the worst case statistical analysis of the subject data, the recommended <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> growth of 6 % will be provided to the designers as the necessary <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> adjustment...|$|R
