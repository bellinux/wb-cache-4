The two <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> Joyce gave the pitcher {{a pat on the}} shoulder, with a warm {{reception}} from the audience. Joyce's accountability and regret, and Galarraga's sportsmanship were widely praised for turning the unfortunate situation into a positive.|$|E

Mr. Jones fired at Mr. Philips without effect and Mr. Philips then fired his pistol in the air, {{upon which the}} seconds interfered, the two man <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> honour was satisfied. Two weeks later, two other {{men who had been}} quarrelling in the {{newspapers}} met on the moor to gain satisfaction.

5|$|The fourth match, between Minoru Suzuki and Kazushi Sakuraba, was {{conducted}} under UWFi rules; {{it would end}} with a knockout, submission, or referee stoppage. During the match, Sakuraba and Suzuki battled onto the entrance ramp, where Sakuraba used a kimura lock to injure Suzuki's arm. When {{they returned to the}} ring, Sakuraba targeted Suzuki's injured arm with kicks, stomps, and a cross armbreaker hold. Suzuki withstood the assault, responding with slaps with his good arm and a running kick to Sakuraba's face. Suzuki applied a rear naked choke, making a judo throw while maintaining the choke (Saka Otoshi). Sakuraba fought the hold until he lost consciousness, at which point the referee stopped the match in favour of Suzuki at 9 minutes and 21 seconds. After the match, the wrestlers <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> embraced.|$|E

5|$|A {{rapprochement}} {{between the}} two men was achieved in the winter of 1384, when Carrouges and Le Gris were both invited to the estate of a mutual friend, Jean Crespin, to celebrate the birth of his son. For the first time, Carrouges brought his wife Marguerite into society and it was at this party that she made her first acquaintance with Le Gris. Despite the tension between them, Carrouges and Le Gris <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> drank together, putting their quarrel behind them before their peers and neighbours. A few months later Jean de Carrouges departed on campaign to Scotland and Le Gris took the opportunity to increase his influence with the Count, making substantial financial and territorial gains in the his rival's absence. Carrouges returned a year later, now a knight but bankrupt, ill and suffering the aftermath of a long and unsuccessful campaign. When Carrouges appeared at Argentan in January 1386 he was involved in a confrontation with his erstwhile friend. Although it is not known what was said, the two men separated on poor terms and Carrouges departed for Paris in a state of agitation.|$|E
25|$|After the 2003 {{earthquake}} in Bam, the Iranian government rebuffed Israel's offer of assistance. On 8 April 2005, Khatami sat near Iranian-born Israeli President Moshe Katsav during {{the funeral of}} Pope John PaulII because of alphabetical order. Later, Katsav <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> spoke with Khatami. Katsav himself is in origin an Iranian Jew, and from a part of Iran close to Khatami's home; he stated that they had spoken about their home province. That would make this incident the first official political contact between Iran and Israel since diplomatic ties were severed in 1979.|$|E

In September 1799, Burr fought a duel with John Barker Church, whose wife, Angelica, was the sister of Hamilton's wife, Elizabeth. Church had alleged that Burr had taken a bribe from the Holland Company in {{exchange}} for using his political influence on its behalf. Burr and Church fired {{at each other and}} missed, and afterward Church acknowledged that he was wrong to have accused Burr without having proof. Burr accepted this as an apology, and the two men <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> ended the dispute.|$|E

25|$|Bret {{returned}} on the January 4, 2010 {{episode of}} Raw, and promptly called out Michaels {{in order to}} bury the hatchet. Hart and Michaels then aired their grievances with one another while recognizing that their Ironman match at Wrestlemania XII {{ought to be the}} highlight of their relationship rather than the Montreal Screwjob. The pair <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> Michaels turned as if to deliver Sweet Chin Music, but instead chose to embrace Hart. While many cast doubts on the sincerity of their reconciliation, Hart has confirmed that it was indeed genuine, as did Michaels, and acknowledged that he felt that Michaels changed as a person, for the better. Later in the night, a storyline between Hart and McMahon began with the two appearing to have their own reconciliation only to have McMahon subsequently kick Hart in the gut: in real life, Hart and McMahon have been on slight speaking terms since 2002, when McMahon called Hart during his recovery from a stroke. The feud culminated in an encounter at WrestleMania 26, which saw Hart defeat McMahon in a match that involved the Hart family. After the match, Hart would continue to periodically work televised events for WWE.|$|E
25|$|Mero got {{involved}} in a rivalry with Cactus Jack after the two were randomly placed as tag team partners via Lethal Lottery for Starrcade but failed to get along. The duo teamed {{for the first time}} on the December 26 episode of Saturday Night, where they defeated Tex Slazenger and Shanghai Pierce. They had a confrontation after the match, during which Jack delivered a double underhook DDT. At Starrcade, Mero's team lost in their Lethal Lottery match after Mero knocked Jack out with a Tutti Frutti. Mero faced Jack in a match on the January 13, 1993 episode of Clash of the Champions, where he lost. Badd began his next major program with Maxx Payne after Payne injured him with a Payne Killer on February 9. During this rivalry, Payne stole the Badd Blaster and Badd attempted to reclaim his gun. Badd lost a match to Payne by forfeit on the June 16 episode of Clash of the Champions after Payne took him out with the Badd Blaster. Badd donned a mask due to the sustained injuries and faced Payne in a series of matches. He defeated Payne at the Beach Blast pay-per-view but lost to him in a no disqualification match on the July 31 episode of Saturday Night. Badd defeated Payne in a mask versus guitar match on the August 18 episode of Clash of the Champions, to claim Payne's guitar. The two ended their feud on the October 30 episode of Saturday Night, where both men <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> buried the hatchet after a confrontation with Paul Orndorff.|$|E

[...] One of his brigade's men bravely lifted his head above the parapet and others from both sides walked onto no man's land. [...] Officers and men <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> exchanged cigarettes and cigars, one of his captains [...] "smoked a cigar with the best shot in the German army", the latter no more than 18 years old. [...] Congreve admitted {{he was reluctant to}} personally witness the scene of the truce for fear he would be a prime target for German snipers.|$|E
500|$|After {{his first}} tour ended flying Stirlings with 218 Squadron, Lamason then {{instructed}} other pilots at 1657 Heavy Conversion Unit. Returning to operations with No. 15 Squadron RAF, Lamason was twice Mentioned in Despatches, first on 2 June 1943 and again, having received promotion to acting squadron leader, on 14 January 1944. [...] He {{was awarded a}} Bar to his DFC on 27 June 1944, for [...] "courage and devotion to duty of a high order" [...] and [...] "vigorous determination" [...] in attacks on Berlin and other heavily defended targets. Lamason was presented his award after the war by King George VI at Buckingham Palace, where he met and befriended a young Princess Elizabeth. A day after making an emergency landing at an American base in England, Lamason was introduced to, <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> spoke with Clark Gable.|$|E
500|$|At the {{interrogation}} centre he was poorly fed and physically weakened. It {{was part of}} the German technique for weakening resistance to interrogation. The Germans had prepared a file on all famous RAF personnel based on information from British newspapers. They knew most of what had happened in his career and private life. While there, he was interrogated by the aide of Reichsmarshall Hermann GÃ¶ring. The German questioned him about British defences and Supermarine Spitfires, {{as he was about to}} resume operations on Ju 88s. Jokingly, Braham advised him to steer clear of Spitfires. While at Oberursel the pilot who had shot him downâ€”Leutnant Robert Spreckels of Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1 Fighter Wing 1)â€” arrived to meet him. Braham was one of his 12 air victories; a figure of 45 is often misquoted. An interpreter was provided. Braham promised to buy him a whisky when the Allies won the war. The statement came as a shock to Spreckels who believed firmly in a German victory. Braham came to respect Spreckels, their differences aside. He learned that Spreckels had lost his parents in a British air attack and was surprised when the German dismissed the fact with the words [...] "it is the war." [...] Both fighter pilots dissociated themselves with the bomber war. They <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> parted.|$|E

500|$|The generals were {{secretly}} interrogated {{for five}} and a half hours, mostly about details of their coup against Diá»‡m, rather than the original charge of promoting neutralism. As all of the officers were involved in the plot against Diá»‡m, this did not reveal any information new to them. The court deliberated for over nine hours, and when it reconvened for the verdict, KhÃ¡nh stated, [...] "We ask that once you begin to serve again in the army, you do not take revenge on anybody". The tribunal then [...] "congratulated" [...] the generals, but found that they were of [...] "lax morality" [...] and unqualified to command due to a [...] "lack of a clear political concept". They were chastised for being [...] "inadequately aware of their heavy responsibility" [...] and of letting [...] "their subordinates take advantage of their positions". KhÃ¡nh also assailed Dinh, claiming that he had derogatorily compared KhÃ¡nh to Gamal Abdel Nasser in a meeting with Diá»‡m. The four imprisoned generals were allowed to remain in Da Lat under surveillance with their families. However, there were reports that the trial ended in a festive manner akin to a party, as the officers <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> made up with one another. All four generals were barred from commanding troops for a period; Kim was banned for six years, and Don 18 months. Offices were prepared for the quartet so that they could participate in [...] "research and planning". Worried that the group of idle officers would plot against him, KhÃ¡nh made some preliminary arrangements to send them to the United States for military study, but this fell through.|$|E
500|$|Michaels {{returned}} to WWE programming {{in a series}} of segments that aired on the August 10, 2009 episode of Raw, where he had, in storyline, left the WWE. Triple H met with Michaels at an office cafeteria in Texas where he was working as a chef; throughout the segments, Triple H would try to convince Michaels to return to WWE and reform DX. After several incidents during the segments, Michaels agreed to team with Triple H to face The Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase) at SummerSlam. At the pay-per-view event, DX defeated Legacy. The two teams would exchange victories, with their feud concluding in October. Two months later, at , DX defeated Chris Jericho and Big Show to win the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match (TLC). On the January 4, 2010 episode of Raw, Michaels buried the hatchet with long-time rival Bret Hart, as they <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> hugged in the ring. In contrast to the storylines featured on the show, this was in fact a real-life reconciliation which laid to rest animosities surrounding the Montreal Screwjob. While some cast doubts on its sincerity, both men have confirmed that it was indeed genuine. DX lost the Unified Tag Team Championship in a Triple Threat match to the team of The Miz and Big Show on the February 8 episode of Raw, the match also included The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk and Luke Gallows). At the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, Michaels cost The Undertaker the World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. At WrestleMania XXVI, Michaels lost to The Undertaker and, as a result, he was forced to retire due to the match stipulation, the same way HBK ended Ric Flair's career. The following night, on the March 29 episode of Raw, Michaels gave an emotional farewell speech, departing with the familiar sentence, [...] "Shawn Michaels has left the building." ...|$|E
