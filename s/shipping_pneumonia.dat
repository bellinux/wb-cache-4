40|$|Unanswered {{questions}} on the etiology and prevention of <b>shipping</b> fever <b>pneumonia</b> have allowed this disease to remain {{one of the most}} costly to the North American cattle industry. Research in this area has indirected that while Pasteurella haemolytica and, to a lesser extent, P. multocida are involved in most cases, they seem to require additional factors to help initiate the disease process. Bovine herpes virus 1 has been shown experimentally to be one such factor. This review examines in some detail the topics of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, shipping fever, and viral-bacterial interactions in the production of respiratory disease in various species. It deals with history, definitions, etiologies, clinical signs and lesions, and considers exposure levels, transmission and various pathogenetic mechanisms that are postulated or known to occur...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory tract infections with {{viruses and}} Pasteurella spp. were {{determined}} sequentially among 26 cattle that died during two severe epizootics of <b>shipping</b> fever <b>pneumonia.</b> Nasal swab and serum {{samples were collected}} prior to onset of the epizootics, during disease progression, and after death, when necropsies were performed and lung samples were collected. Eighteen normal control cattle also were sampled {{at the beginning of}} the epizootics as well as at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. Respiratory bovine coronaviruses (RBCV) were isolated from nasal secretions of 21 and 25 cattle before and after transport. Two and 17 cattle nasally shed Pasteurella spp. before and after transport, respectively. RBCV were isolated at titers of 1 × 103 to 1. 2 × 107 PFU per g of lung tissue from 18 cattle that died within 7 days of the epizootics, but not from the lungs of the remaining cattle that died on days 9 to 36. Twenty-five of the 26 lung samples were positive for Pasteurella spp., and their CFU ranged between 4. 0 × 105 and 2. 3 × 109 per g. Acute and subacute exudative, necrotizing lobar pneumonia characterized the lung lesions of these cattle with a majority of pneumonic lung lobes exhibiting fibronecrotic and exudative changes typical of pneumonic pasteurellosis, but other lung lobules had histological changes consisting of bronchiolitis and alveolitis typical of virus-induced changes. These cattle were immunologically naive to both infectious agents at the onset of the epizootics, but those that died after day 7 had rising antibody titers against RBCV and Pasteurella haemolytica. In contrast, the 18 clinically normal and RBCV isolation-negative cattle had high hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titers to RBCV from the beginning, while their antibody responses to P. haemolytica antigens were delayed. Evans' criteria for causation were applied to our findings because of the multifactorial nature of <b>shipping</b> fever <b>pneumonia.</b> This analysis identified RBCV as the primary inciting cause in these two epizootics. These viruses were previously not recognized as a causative agent in this complex respiratory tract disease of cattle...|$|R
40|$|Pasteurella haemolytica {{serotype}} A 1 isolates {{were collected}} from cattle within a feedlot during an outbreak of bovine respiratory disease. Genetic heterogeneity among the isolates was examined by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA), ribotyping, and analysis of plasmid content. The susceptibilities of isolates to several antibiotics were also examined. Five different REA patterns and three different ribotypes were observed among the isolates. Fifty percent of the isolates had an identical REA type, ribotype, and plasmid profile. Examination of the plasmid content of the isolates revealed that most (73 %) carry a single plasmid which encodes beta-lactamase, 13. 5 % carry two plasmids, and 13. 5 % carry no plasmid. The data reveal the presence of genetic differences among isolates of P. haemolytica A 1, associated with <b>shipping</b> fever <b>pneumonia</b> within a closed feedlot, and suggest {{that a combination of}} REA, ribotyping, plasmid analysis, and antibiotic susceptibility determination will be useful in analyzing the molecular epidemiology of this disease...|$|R

Antibody titers were also assayed in serum from 84 calves on entry to feedlots in the fall of 1979. Titers on entry were low compared to antibody levels at necropsy. Cattle which died with pneumonia, in particular those dying of fibrinous <b>pneumonia</b> (<b>shipping</b> fever), had lower levels of antibody to P. haemolytica than did those dying of other causes...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine if Pasteurella haemolytica within feedlot cattle affected by pneumonic pasteurellosis express fimbriae (pili) and bacterial glycocalyx. Bacteriological culture of pulmonary tissue from three calves with fibrinous pneumonia resulted in heavy growth of P. haemolytica. Transmission electron microscopy of the lungs showed numerous microcolonies of gram-negative bacteria with morphology typical of Pasteurella haemolytica. The cells within these microcolonies possessed bacterial glycocalyces which stained with ruthenium red. Glycocalyx-encased microcolonies were also present in specimens examined by scanning electron microscopy. Typical P. haemolytica cells were evident in a tracheal specimen and these bacteria had radial glycocalyces consistent with polysaccharide and proteinaceous material condensed on linear structures suggestive of fimbriae. The pathogenetic importance of the bacterial glycocalyx and fimbriae in <b>shipping</b> fever <b>pneumonia</b> {{has yet to be}} established but their presence in clinical cases of Pasteurella pneumonia in feedlot cattle further supports a possible role in the initiation and progression of this disease as well as bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents.

40|$|The serum {{antibody}} {{responses of}} cattle with respiratory coronavirus infections during {{the pathogenesis of}} <b>shipping</b> fever <b>pneumonia</b> were analyzed with different bovine coronavirus antigens, including those from a wild-type respiratory bovine coronavirus (RBCV) strain (97 TXSF-Lu 15 - 2) directly isolated from lung tissue from a fatally infected bovine, a wild-type enteropathogenic bovine coronavirus (EBCV) strain (Ly 138 - 3), and the highly cell culture-adapted, enteric prototype strain (EBCV L 9 - 81). Infectivity-neutralizing (IN) and hemagglutinin-inhibiting (HAI) activities were tested. Sequential serum samples, collected during {{the onset of the}} respiratory coronavirus infection and at weekly intervals for 5 weeks thereafter, had significantly higher IN and HAI titers for antigens of RBCV strain 97 TXSF-Lu 15 - 2 than for the wild-type and the highly cell culture-adapted EBCV strains, with P values ranging from < 0. 0001 to 0. 0483. The IN and HAI antibody responses against the two EBCV strains did not differ significantly, but the lowest titers were detected with EBCV strain L 9 - 81...|$|R
40|$|The {{induction}} of {{pneumonic pasteurellosis}} in guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) was examined. Specific pathogen free male guinea pigs were anesthetized and a tracheostomy performed to introduce 10 (5), 10 (4) or 10 (3) Pasteurella haemolytica-A 1 {{into the left}} principal bronchus. The surgical site was closed with tissue adhesive and staples and the animals were monitored for signs of respiratory tract infection. Within 24 hours after inoculation they became depressed, anorectic, pyretic and dyspneic. Fibrinous pleuropneumonia with prominent areas of necrosis and hemorrhage was present. Pericardial effusion was a frequent finding. There was infiltration of the pleura and alveoli with degenerate heterophils and macrophages, a hyperplastic mesothelium and fibrin exudation on the pleura and within alveoli. Hemorrhage, congestion, consolidation, edema and fibrin exudation were prominent in the hilar region of the lungs. Bacterial colonies were evident in all airways. More bacteria were recovered from infected lungs than were inoculated (p less than 0. 05) indicating P. haemolytica was actively multiplying in the lungs. Hematological and clinical chemistry data were consistent with fibrinous pneumonia, however, blood cultures were positive for P. haemolytica in 61 % (11 / 18) of animals sampled. Examination of pneumonic pasteurellosis in guinea pigs {{may be useful in}} studying pathogenetic and pathological features applicable to bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis (<b>shipping</b> fever <b>pneumonia)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Several modern {{electron}} microscopy techniques {{were used to}} examine Pasteurella haemolytica (biotype A, serotype 1) (strain B 122) recovered from experimentally infected cattle and in situ within the lung tissue of experimentally infected cattle. Glycocalyx {{four to five times}} thicker than that seen on P. haemolytica grown in vitro was evident on bacterial cells recovered from live infected calves by pulmonary lavage. Fimbriae were also present on cells recovered by lavage. A thick glycocalyx was also seen on P. haemolytica-A 1 within the lungs of experimentally infected cattle at necropsy. In summary, cells of P. haemolytica-A 1 in experimentally infected cattle have fimbriae and glycocalyx on their cell surfaces and these structures appear to be important in bacterial colonization of the bovine respiratory tract and pathogenesis of <b>shipping</b> fever (Pasteurella) <b>pneumonia...</b>|$|R
40|$|Respiratory bovine coronaviruses (RBCV) {{emerged as}} an {{infectious}} agent most frequently isolated from respiratory tract samples of cattle with acute respiratory tract diseases. Infectivity-neutralizing (IN) and hemagglutinin-inhibiting (HAI) antibodies induced by RBCV infections were monitored in sequential serum samples collected from cattle during a naturally evolving and experimentally monitored epizootic of <b>shipping</b> fever <b>pneumonia</b> (SFP). Cattle nasally shedding RBCV {{at the beginning of}} the epizootic started with low levels of serum IN and HAI antibodies. An increase in serum IN antibody after day 7 led to reduction of virus shedding in nasal secretions by the majority of the cattle between days 7 and 14. A substantial rise in the serum HAI antibody was observed during the initial phase among the sick but not the clinically normal cattle which were infected with RBCV. The RBCV isolation-positive cattle that developed fatal SFP had minimal serum IN and HAI antibodies during the course of disease development. Cattle that remained negative in RBCV isolation tests entered this epizootic with high levels of serum IN and HAI antibodies, which dramatically increased during the next two weeks. Protection against SFP was apparently associated with significantly higher levels of serum IN antibodies {{at the beginning of the}} epizootic. The RBCV-neutralizing activity is associated with serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), particularly the IgG 2 subclass, while RBCV-specific HAI antibody is related to both serum IgG and IgM fractions...|$|R
40|$|The leukotoxin of Mannheimia haemolytica is an {{important}} virulence factor that contributes {{to much of the}} pathology observed in the lungs of animals with bovine <b>shipping</b> fever <b>pneumonia.</b> We believe that identification of factors that regulate leukotoxin expression may provide insight into M. haemolytica pathogenicity. The DNA sequence upstream of the leukotoxin operon is divergently shared by PlapT, which transcribes an arginine permease gene. The intergenic region contains several elements that are potential sites for transcriptional modulation of the promoters. We have developed plasmid-borne chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) operon fusions, as well as lktC::cat chromosomal fusions, to study transcription initiation in M. haemolytica. Using these genetic tools, we have identified cis-acting sequences and environmental conditions that modulate transcription of the leukotoxin and lapT promoters. By deletion analysis, promoters were shown to rely on sequences upstream of their − 10 and − 35 regions for full activity. Direct repeats of the sequence TGT-N(11) -ACA and a static bend region caused by phased adenine tracts were necessary for full activation of Plkt. A computer-generated model of the promoter's structure shows how DNA bending brings the repeat sequences within close proximity to the Plkt RNA polymerase, and we hypothesize that these repeats are a binding site for an activator of leukotoxin transcription. The lktC::cat operon fusion was also used to demonstrate that, like that of other RTX toxins, leukotoxin transcription is environmentally regulated. Roles for iron deprivation and temperature change were identified...|$|R
40|$|Mannheimia haemolytica {{serotype}} 1 (S 1) is {{the most}} common bacterial isolate found in <b>shipping</b> fever <b>pneumonia</b> in beef cattle. Currently used vaccines against M. haemolytica do not provide complete protection against the disease. Research with M. haemolytica outer membrane proteins (OMPs) has shown that antibodies to one particular OMP from S 1, PlpE, may be important in immunity. In a recently published work, members of our laboratory showed that recombinant PlpE (rPlpE) is highly immunogenic when injected subcutaneously into cattle and that the acquired immunity markedly enhanced resistance to experimental challenge (A. W. Confer, S. Ayalew, R. J. Panciera, M. Montelongo, L. C. Whitworth, and J. D. Hammer, Vaccine 21 : 2821 - 2829, 2003). The objective of this work was to identify epitopes of PlpE that are responsible for inducing the immune response. Western blot analysis of a series of rPlpE with nested deletions on both termini with bovine anti-PlpE hyperimmune sera showed that the immunodominant region is located close to the N terminus of PlpE. Fine epitope mapping, in which an array of overlapping 13 -mer synthetic peptides attached to a derivatized cellulose membrane was probed with various affinity-purified anti-PlpE antibodies, identified eight highly reactive regions, of which region 2 (R 2) was identified as the specific epitope. The R 2 region is comprised of eight imperfect repeats of a hexapeptide (QAQNAP) and is located between residues 26 and 76. Complement-mediated bactericidal activity of affinity-purified anti-PlpE bovine antibodies confirmed that antibodies directed against the R 2 region are effective in killing M. haemolytica...|$|R
40|$|Pasteurella haemolytica, the causative {{agent of}} <b>shipping</b> fever <b>pneumonia</b> in cattle, {{produces}} a leukotoxin (LKT) which lyses ruminant leukocytes with high efficiency but is reputed to not affect leukocytes from nonruminant species. In this study, {{we tested the}} supposition that LKT binding correlates positively with susceptibility to intoxication of susceptible isolated bovine lymphocytes and lymphoma tissue culture cells (BL 3 cells) and negatively with reputed nonsusceptible equine, porcine, and canine lymphocytes and human lymphoid tissue culture cells (Raji cells). Bovine lymphocytes and BL 3 cells were highly susceptible to LKT intoxication, exhibiting both substantial increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration and marked leukolysis. Exposure of reputed LKT-nonsusceptible porcine lymphocytes and Raji cells to LKT caused a slightly increased intracellular Ca 2 + concentration but no leukolysis. No LKT effect was detected for equine and canine lymphocytes. LKT bound to lymphoid cells from all species tested. Intact 102 -kDa LKT was recovered from exposed isolated lymphoid cell membranes. Pro-LKT acylation was not required for LKT binding to BL 3 cells. LKT binding was rapid, with maximal binding occurring by 3 min, and was proportional to the LKT concentration in the range 0. 04 to 4. 0 μg/ml. For this LKT concentration range, BL 3 cells bound more LKT than did porcine lymphocytes or Raji cells, suggesting that LKT binds to BL 3 cells with higher affinity than to porcine lymphocytes or Raji cells. Above 4. 0 μg/ml, LKT demonstrated saturable binding to BL 3 cells. Neutralizing anti-LKT monoclonal antibody (MAb) MM 601 diminished LKT binding to BL 3 by 36 % while decreasing leukolysis by 81 %. In contrast, MM 601 did not diminish LKT binding to Raji cells. Pretreatment of target cells with 120 μg of protease K per ml diminished LKT binding to BL 3 cells by 75 %, with only a 25 % decrease in leukolysis. However, pretreatment with 150 μg of protease K per ml abolished the remaining 25 % of LKT binding and 75 % leukolysis. Therefore, P. haemolytica LKT binds rapidly to susceptible and to reputed nonsusceptible lymphoid cells. LKT binding resulting in species-specific leukolysis was characterized by high affinity, inhibition by MAb MM 601, and relative resistance to protease K pretreatment of lymphoid cells. Two types of LKT binding to lymphoid cells are proposed. High-affinity binding leads to efficient leukolysis. In some lymphoid cells from reputed LKT-nonsusceptible species, low-affinity LKT binding may cause a low-efficiency increase in the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration without leading to leukolysis...|$|R
