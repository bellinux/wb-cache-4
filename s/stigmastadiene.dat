40|$|The {{increased}} {{marketing of}} olive oil in Brazil has intensified legal requirements to ensure regulation of this product. The measurement of the specific extinction at 270 nm (E 270) and content of <b>stigmastadiene</b> {{can be used to}} assess the presence of refined oils in virgin olive oil. During the vegetable oil refining process, compounds with conjugated double bonds are generated from unsaturated fatty acids that absorb at 270 nm and sterols, such as stigmasta- 3, 5 -diene. To compare these parameters, seven samples of extra virgin olive oil and three samples {{of olive oil}} (blend of virgin and refined) were analyzed. Among the samples analyzed, four extra virgin samples had levels of <b>stigmastadiene</b> and E 270 higher than expected, among which two were adulterated with seed oil (rich in linoleic acid) and the other two with olive pomace oil. The results demonstrate the higher sensitivity of <b>stigmastadiene</b> to determine the presence of the refined oil in virgin olive oil and good agreement with determining E 270. The latter technique is a simple, quick, and low cost method of determination that can be easily implemented in laboratories to assist in the screening and regulation of olive oils sold in Brazil...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePyrolysis-gas (Py-GC) {{chromatography}} {{was used}} to characterize organic [(diethyl ether (DEE) and chloroform (CHCl 3) ] extracts of raw and composted duck excreta enriched wood shavings from two finishing cycles (C 1 and C 2). Materials were collected on days 0, 8 and 23. C 1 contained 1. 7 % total N while C 2 contained 0. 9 % total N. Py-GC-MS (mass spectrometry) showed that the extracts contained n-alkanes (C 12 to C 32), alkenes (C 12 : 1 to C 33 : 1), n-fatty acids (C 12 to C 28), unsaturated fatty acids (C 18 : 1 and C 18 : 2), and sterols (chochlestene, cholestadiene, stigmastene, <b>stigmastadiene,</b> stigmastatriene, cholesterol, stigmastanol, stigmastanone, stigmastadienone, 17 -methyl dialkylsulfanyl decahydro- 1 H-cyclopenta [a] phenanthrene, 17 -methyl dialkylsulfanyl dodecahydro- 1 H-cyclopenta [a] phenanthrene, and 17 -methyl- 17 -dialkylsulfanyl decahydro- 1 H-cyclopenta [a] phenanthrene). Other components identified were prystene, squalene (precursor of cholesterol), phthalic acid, diphenylpropane, diphenylbut- 2 -ene and 1, 3, 6 triphenyl hex- 4 -ene. Our data showed {{significant changes in the}} lipid composition of duck excreta enriched wood shavings during composting, which appeared {{to be related to the}} total N content of the system...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Qualidade e Segurança Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{main goal}} of the present work was the {{application}} of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) in the characterization of soybean oil, sunflower oil, {{extra virgin olive oil}} and olive oil. Firstly, the models provided by Bruker, the equipment manufacturer, were validated. These models are related to the fatty acid composition and acidity for oils and olive oils, iodine value for oils and peroxide value, ultraviolet absorbance (232 and 270 nm), -sitosterol and total sterols in olive oils. Simultaneously calibration models were developed for the individual oils (fatty acid composition, iodine value, anisidine value and the ultraviolet absorbance (230 and 270 nm) and olive oils (acidity, fatty acid composition, -sitosterol, total sterol, absorbance at 232 nm, erythrodiol and uvaol). Also two calibration models were developed for the quantification of <b>stigmastadienes</b> in extra virgin olive oils, to detect and quantify the presence of soybean oil or sunflower oil. Both models proved promising – sunflower oil (r 2 = 0, 94; RMSECV = 0, 013 ppm; RPD = 3, 95) and soybean oil (r 2 = 0, 70; RMSECV = 0, 054 ppm; RPD = 1, 82). However, it is necessary to analyze a greater number of samples to carry out an external validatio...|$|R
