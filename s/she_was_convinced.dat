5|$|Breakaway is {{the second}} studio album by American singer Kelly Clarkson, {{released}} on November 30, 2004, by RCA Records. The album is a follow-up to her successful debut album, Thankful (2003). Executive produced by Clive Davis, Breakaway sees Clarkson collaborating with various producers and songwriters for the first time, primarily Dr. Luke, Max Martin, John Shanks, Kara DioGuardi, Ben Moody, and David Hodges; the latter two are former members of American rock band Evanescence. Despite the established commercial success of Thankful, music critics still continued to typecast Clarkson as an American Idol winner and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> by Davis to work with Dr. Luke and Martin in Stockholm, and with Moody and Hodges in Los Angeles, {{in pursuit of a}} pop rock direction. This also led her to part ways with her manager Simon Fuller and hire the management services of Jeff Kwatinetz before the album's release. Breakaway is predominately a pop rock album with elements of rock and soul music, marking a departure from the R sound of Thankful; its lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, love, and escapism.|$|E

25|$|Their {{parents were}} against the match. Alexander II {{did not want}} to lose his daughter, to whom he was deeply attached.

25|$|In the United States, Peter II soon drifted away. Having made poor {{financial}} investments, he {{lost the}} little money he had left. Unable {{to adapt to the}} daily life of a normal citizen, he gradually turned to alcoholism and trying to forget his problems with several affairs with younger women. For her part, Alexandra's love for her husband turned to obsession. Probably prone to anorexia for years, she developed a body dysmorphic disorder, which led her to undergo removal of the breasts because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that Peter II didn't like her chest.

25|$|Scholars differ {{about why}} Dowager Queen Elizabeth {{spent the last}} five years of her life living at Bermondsey Abbey, to which she retired on 12 February 1487. Among her modern biographers, David Baldwin {{believes}} that Henry VII forced her retreat from the Court, while Arlene Okerlund presents evidence from July 1486 that she was already planning her retirement from court to live a religious, contemplative life at Bermondsey Abbey. Another suggestion is that her retreat to Bermondsey was forced on her because she was in some way involved in the 1487 Yorkist rebellion of Lambert Simnel, or at least was seen as a potential ally of the rebels, a curious role for her to take if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that both her sons had died in 1483.|$|E
25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> {{it was a}} Sidney Lumet project, but {{the film}} rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a {{different}} picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E

500|$|Isenhour was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf, and became Wolf's senior campaign adviser during his 2014 campaign, {{at a time when}} state Representative Allyson Schwartz and state Treasurer Rob McCord were considered to have better chances of winning. Isenhour, who had long been acquainted with Wolf, had not intended to become involved with a lengthy and work-intensive gubernatorial campaign, but said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> to do so after an hour-long phone conversation with Wolf in 2013, after which <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> he was the right man for the job: [...] "I've been in politics 30 years and I've never had a candidate like this." [...] Isenhour maintained other clients during his campaign, but said Wolf was [...] "my main focus for the next year and a half". After Wolf's successful election, Isenhour co-chaired his inaugural committee, then worked as his Secretary of Legislative Affairs, serving as a liaison during negotiating sessions at the Pennsylvania General Assembly, and providing key planning during the governor's budget strategy. Political reporter John L. Micek wrote of Isenhour: [...] "She is in the unique position of having to work with Republicans she once ran campaigns against." [...] Her annual salary in the position was $145,018. Isenhour developed a reputation for communicating and building relationships with legislative leaders and staff members from both parties.|$|E

She thought it was odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E

500|$|Barrett spent 1908 first organinsing a {{campaign}} in Nottingham and then {{working on the}} by-elections in both Dewsbury and Dundee.

After recovering she moved closer to home, volunteering for Annie Kenney in Bristol. She soon agreed to resume her role as a paid organiser for he WSPU and was sent to Newport in south-east Wales to continue her duties.

The meeting lasted two and a half hours, and by its end <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that Lloyd George had been insincere over his support for equal voting rights and believed him to be against women's suffrage. By {{the end of the year}} her post was changed to organising all WSPU activities in Wales and she was relocated to the country's headquarters in Cardiff.
