5000|$|Miniature wave <b>selective</b> <b>solder</b> fountain(s): This {{typically}} uses a round miniature pumped solder wave, {{similar to}} the end of a pencil or crayon, to sequentially solder the PCB. The process is slower than the two previous methods, but more accurate. The PCB may be fixed, and the wave solder pot moved underneath the PCB; alternately, the PCB may be articulated over a fixed wave or solder bath to undergo the selective-soldering process. Unlike the first two examples, this process is toolless.|$|E
5000|$|Surface-mount {{technology}} {{was developed in}} the 1960s and became widely used in the mid 1980s. Much of the pioneering work in this {{technology was}} by IBM. The design approach first demonstrated by IBM in 1960 in a small-scale computer was later applied in the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer used in the Instrument Unit that guided all Saturn IB and Saturn V vehicles. Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be directly soldered {{to the surface of the}} PCB. Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of a board became far more common with surface mounting than through-hole mounting, allowing much higher circuit densities. Often only the solder joints hold the parts to the board, in rare cases parts on the bottom or [...] "second" [...] side of the board may be secured with a dot of adhesive to keep components from dropping off inside reflow ovens if the part has a large size or weight. [...] Adhesive is sometimes used to hold SMT components on the bottom side of a board if a wave soldering process is used to solder both SMT and through-hole components simultaneously. Alternatively, SMT and through-hole components can be soldered together without adhesive if the SMT parts are first reflow-soldered, then a <b>selective</b> <b>solder</b> mask is used to prevent the solder holding the parts in place from reflowing and the parts floating away during wave soldering. Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor cost and greatly increasing production rates. SMDs can be one-quarter to one-tenth the size and weight, and one-half to one-quarter the cost of equivalent through-hole parts.|$|E
40|$|Solar {{cells have}} to be {{connected}} electrically {{to each other in}} a solar module. During the last years, new connection techniques with low stress have been developed, such as <b>selective</b> <b>soldering.</b> The industrially most frequently used <b>selective</b> <b>soldering</b> techniques are induction soldering, contact soldering, laser soldering and spot light soldering. The aim of this work is to evaluate the characteristics of solder joints, which are produced by the use of <b>selective</b> <b>soldering</b> techniques. Therefore adhesive strength tests, electrical characterizations and x-ray analyses have been performed. In this process one front-side metallization, a SnAg-solder and a SnPbAg-solder were used. The characterization method will be demonstrated on the spot light soldering technique. In addition the influence of the solder joint quality on the resistance of the whole solar cell will be demonstrated and discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>{{soldering}}</b> is {{a process}} for soldering thru-hole components on the bottom side of an assembly. In a <b>selective</b> <b>soldering</b> process a robot system is used {{to pick up the}} assembly and drag it over a single point select wave, or dip the assembly into multiple nozzles that are mounted on a product specific nozzle plate. In contrast, the soldering process utilizing traditional wave soldering equipment consists of transporting the entire assembly, by means of a conveyor system, over a liquid solder wave. The implementation of lead-free alloys will affect the thermal load of components and board material due to higher process temperatures. Not all of the components can withstand the high temperatures that they may be exposed to during wave and reflow processes. For this reason <b>selective</b> <b>soldering</b> becomes interesting since in this process only the areas that come into contact with the lead-free solder will reach higher temperatures while other sections and components remain significantly below critical temperature levels. This paper focuses on the effects of board surface finishes and <b>selective</b> <b>soldering</b> process parameters such as drag speed and solderpot temperatures, on the formation and strength of the solder joints. The analysis shows that the process development and material selection should be optimized per component type. This work was accomplished within the scope of the NEMI Lead Fre...|$|R
40|$|The {{packaging}} of optoelectronics and MEMS devices is placing challenging {{requirements for}} the interconnection and soldering technology. These requirements {{can no longer be}} met with standard flux– based processes which use a long temperature reflow profile and are implementing a lot of mechanical handling steps and processes. Basically, the packaging of these new devices is requiring fluxless soldering, no thermal stress by localized heating, low respectively no mechanical contact and damage on sensitive membranes in MEMS or optical components (like lenses, etc.). Some of these applications even require 3 D–packaging and <b>selective</b> <b>solder</b> application in 3 D-structures, like cavity, vertical assembly, etc. An additional, very challenging requirement is a high flexibility in solder alloys because eutectic tin lead and other lead-based solder alloys are not applicable. Instead Gold/Tin and Indium-based solder alloys are required. In order to fulfill the specific needs in these applications, a new laser-based solder jetting technology has been developed. This technology fulfills all the needs of fluxless soldering, local heating and reflow, no mechanical contact and stress during soldering, high solder alloy flexibility and capability of 3 D-packaging. Prior to developing the Solder Ball Bumper Jet (SB-Jet) process, many potential applications have bee...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{creation}} of a more economical bumping process has been the focus. One of the most promising technologies is the low-cost stencil printing based flip-chip technology. It consists of electroless Nickel/Gold (Ni / Au) Under Bump Metallurgy (UBM) plated on an Aluminum bond pad, followed by <b>selective</b> <b>solder</b> paste printing, using the stencil mask, on top of the UBM. It eliminates the expensive photolithography with thick photoresist and the usage of vacuum sputtering. Ni/Au UBM is not only important in stencil printed bumping technology, but also widely used in some of the anisotropic conductive flip chip technologies as conductive mini bump for the anisotropic conductive film (ACF). The redistribution (RDL) technology facilitates the adaptation of chips designed for wire bonding to flip chip bonding, and relaxes the otherwise tight wire bond pitch to a loose area array pitch. RDLs are formed by adding passivation and metal layers on the top of die, relocating the pads according to the design rules of the solder bumping process. The basic redistribution process includes both a reroute metal layer and additional dielectric layers. The redistribution metal can be aluminum, copper, or other metals. The choice of the conductive material is determined by the substrate and the electrical requirements of the IC. The most popular dielectrics for redistribution technology are Benzocyclobutene (BCB) and Polyimide (PI). BCB has a number of properties that makes it suitable for thick passivation including low moisture uptake, a low dielectric constant and a high degree of planarization over the topography in IC chips...|$|E
50|$|Other <b>selective</b> <b>soldering</b> {{applications}} are non-electronic, such as lead-frame attachment to ceramic substrates, coil-lead attachment, SMT attachment (such as LEDs to PCBs) and fire sprinklers (where the fuse is low-temperature solder alloys).|$|R
5000|$|Mass <b>selective</b> dip <b>solder</b> fountain: A {{variant of}} selective-aperture {{soldering}} in which specialized tooling (with apertures to allow solder to be pumped through it) represent the areas to be soldered. The PCB is then presented over the selective-solder fountain; all <b>selective</b> <b>soldering</b> of the PCB is soldered simultaneously as {{the board is}} lowered into the solder fountain. Each tool is specific to a PCB assembly.|$|R
50|$|Regardless of the <b>selective</b> <b>soldering</b> {{equipment}} used, {{there are}} two types of selective flux applicators: spray and dropjet fluxers. The spray fluxer applies atomized flux to a specific area, while the dropjet fluxer is more precise; the choice depends on the circumstances surrounding the soldering application.|$|R
5000|$|Laser <b>Selective</b> <b>Soldering</b> System: A new system, able {{to import}} CAD-based board layouts {{and use that}} data to {{position}} a laser to directly solder any point on the board. Its advantages are the elimination of thermal stress, its non-contact quality, consistent high-quality solder joints and flexibility. Soldering time averages one second per joint; stencils and solder masks may be eliminated from the circuit board to reduce manufacturing costs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>soldering</b> is {{the process}} of {{selectively}} soldering components to printed circuit boards and molded modules that could be damaged by the heat of a reflow oven in a traditional surface-mount technology (SMT) assembly process. This usually follows an SMT oven reflow process; parts to be selectively soldered are usually surrounded by parts that have been previously soldered in a surface-mount reflow process, and the selective-solder process must be sufficiently precise to avoid damaging them.|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{behaviors}} of liquid solders, which are demanded for the lead-free changeover, are unsatisfactory known for the so called flow soldering processes, that is wave <b>soldering</b> and <b>selective</b> <b>soldering.</b> The poor wetting behavior, the incomplete via filling and also for resulting failure in the solder joints like fillet lifting {{are related to the}} lead-free solders, the causal correlation widely unexplored. Additional micro-alloyed elements in the solder alloys, which serve the purpose to reduce the dissolving of pcb metallization or pot corrosion as well the hardening of the solder joints, were qualitatively specified by the suppliers, but often not comparable in its effects. Therefore an industrial team was founded together with Fraunhofer IZM with the objective to conduct comparable investigations of liquid solders. Selected results will be presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{growth in}} the telecommunications sector {{in the mid to}} late 1990 ’s saw a high demand in the area of optical packages and optical networks. This sudden growth in demand for optical technology in telecom and data communication applications could not be supported by the existing manufacturing infrastructure; so, to meet the growing volume needs of the industry – the electronics manufacturing sector adopted what was still a laboratory method of assembling technique to high volume manufacturing. Since most of the assembly of the optical component and attaching the component to the board involved tedious manual labor, the process often resulted in a high cycle time and low yields. This drove the need for automated or semi-automated assembly processes that would address these issues and result in a lower cost solution to the contract electronic manufacturer. This paper discusses one of the National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative’s (NEMI) projects addressing this issue. The main purpose of this research project is to identify low-cost, high-yield, data-driven processes such as laser <b>selective</b> <b>soldering</b> and infra-red (IR) soldering to attach non-reflowable optoelectronic packages to circuit boards. Packages whose form factors are currently not standardized will be assembled, placed, affixed to board and connected using automated techniques in order to reduce costs significantly in terms of cycle time, rework, and unreworkable scrap. With the current and foreseeable lack of standard packages formats, the use of data-driven <b>selective</b> <b>soldering</b> techniques hold the promise of maintaining flexibility while replacing the manual assembly techniques that incur high costs and high yields. This paper will discuss the need for automation – the factors supporting and challenging the needs for the same are also addressed. One of the actions undertaken to quantify and justify the need for an automated process is the creation of a Cost of Ownership (COO) model based on the industry standard SEMI E 35. Results from the cost model are discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a feasibility study of using eddy current induced heating for the solder reflow of area array packages. With a high frequency electromagnetic field, Sn 3. 5 % Ag lead-free solder balls were heated to melt and wet the solder pads on an organic substrate. The experimental {{results showed that}} such a solder reflow process could be implemented effectively in a wide processing window. With an infrared temperature sensor, {{it was found that}} the temperature difference between the solder balls and the FR 4 board might reach 80 degrees C, indicating a rather localized heating mechanism. In addition, the heating and cooling rates during the soldering were found very high. This is another feature of the induction heating reflow process. It was also found that the generated temperature in the solder balls would depend on the size of the solder balls. This characteristic may be used to perform <b>selective</b> <b>soldering</b> of flip chip BGA packages. Furthermore, the developed soldering process was applied to the board level reflow of actual components. The result verified that the induction heating reflow is a feasible soldering process in actual applications. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|This poster {{presents}} {{the principles and}} state {{of the work of}} a joint research project ?MICROFLOW?, funded by the German Department for Education and Research (BMBF). The usually used simultaneous reflow soldering processes were optimized in the past for a minimum of temperature difference between small and large or heavy components. A further development of soldering processes is demanded because of the increasing requirements for polymer electronics, electrical-optical assemblies or high temperature electronics. The technology developed should allow a direct heating of the solder paste while the components are at a considerably lower temperature. This is possible only by sequentially working <b>selective</b> <b>soldering</b> processes at present. The selective heating method for a simultaneous process presented here is possible using microwaves provided the energy penetrates the assembly and heats certain regions only, depending on specific material characteristics. Today?s conventional solder pastes are already able to be heated with microwave, but only very slowly and using a high power density. It is possible to increase the absorbed heat considerably by mixing additional materials referred to as suszeptors into the solder paste which are absorbing microwave power. A main task for a save microwave application was to guarantee the operators safety and to ensure the electromagnetic compatibility to the printed circuit boards, integrated circuits and other components as well.

In this way it is possible to accelerate the heating of the solder paste significant in comparison with the remaining assembly, whereby the demanded microwave energy can be minimized. Beside of this fundamental work, to generate a microwave suited heat source in the solder paste, the usual works of paste or flux development and qualification are also very important. First of all the wetting quality, especially for lead-free solders and no less the behaviors of flux residues, have to be investigated. Therefore the solder melting and wetting was investigated, including solder balling tests on different substrate materials. In the next step various corrosion tests like humidity storage and surface insulation measurements were carried out. The test results were leading to a goal-directed selection and optimization of flux systems for a new microwave suited solder paste...|$|R
