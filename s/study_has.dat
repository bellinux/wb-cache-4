50|$|Limited <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> {{examined}} ideological {{correlates of}} the belief in a just world.

30|$|From the 9 -point Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale [34], 1 <b>study</b> <b>had</b> {{a quality}} score of 6, 6 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> a quality score of 7, 32 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> a quality score of 8, and 15 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> a quality score of 9 (only peer-reviewed {{articles}} were assessed).

5|$|Another {{potential}} protocarnivorous pitfall trap is {{a species}} of teasel, Dipsacus fullonum, which has been only suggested as a possible carnivore. Only one major <b>study</b> <b>has</b> examined D. fullonum for carnivory and no evidence of digestive enzymes or foliar nutrient absorption was revealed.|$|E

30|$|Nine of the {{analyzed}} studies included well-trained individuals, six of {{the studies}} included moderately trained individuals, and five studies included untrained individuals. The degree of inertia {{in the included studies}} varied between 0.07 and 0.145  kg m 2. The rest times between sets varied between 1 and 5  min (1 <b>study</b> <b>had</b> 1  min, 1 <b>study</b> <b>had</b> 1.5  min, 11 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> 2  min, 5 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> 3  min, and 2 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> 5  min).

5|$|A recent threat, first {{reported}} in 1978, is forest dieback. In some areas, {{especially in the}} peripheral region, this has been severe with nearly a 50% in vegetation. Water deficiency has been attributed as {{the main cause of}} dieback as droughts are becoming more frequent. Regrowth of forest is hindered by frost which is increasingly severe. The forest dieback has affected 22 species of plants with Calophyllum walkeri being the most affected. A <b>study</b> <b>has</b> suggested that low calcium causes soil acidification and increased toxicity caused by metallic elements such as aluminium may be causing the dieback. Leaching of nutrients and the resulting imbalance in soil micronutrients may also be contributing to the dieback.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many of the}} afore-mentioned inhibitors {{share the}} same Hsp90 binding site (either N- or C-terminal), {{it has been shown}} that some of these drugs {{preferentially}} access distinct Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by the extent of their post-translational modification. Though no published inhibitor has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent <b>study</b> <b>has</b> shown that phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide isoform specificity to inhibitor binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation for optimal Hsp90 targeting.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>study</b> <b>has</b> implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This {{rare and}} severe autosomal recessive disorder associated with partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulation defects and propensity to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, caused by incomplete phagocytosis due to failure in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may imply {{the role of}} EFS as a disease progression modifier, although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Attempts to {{quantify}} {{the economic impact of}} growth in the air transport sector generate results which depend on assumptions made, and therefore the viewpoint of the organisation making the analysis. The OEF <b>study</b> <b>has</b> produced a figure of £2.5billion per annum of additional GDP by 2015 for Heathrow, or £7billion per annum by 2030 if a third runway is built there. Full implementation of the White Paper runway proposals resulted in a forecast yield of an additional £13billion per annum in GDP by 2030. Calculations done for the AEF, based on a new runway at Stansted, and which assume increased taxation of the industry, result in a negative economic benefit.|$|E

50|$|Most glioblastomas are {{infected}} with cytomegalovirus, which speeds the development of tumors. Though some <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> shown that farmers have higher rates of gliomas compared to the general population, exposure to farm animals or manure is not associated with glioma. Later <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> not found an association between farming and gliomas; similar conflicting data concerns teachers and glioma. More consistent data shows that architects, surveyors, retail workers, butchers, and engineers have higher rates of gliomas. Most <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> found that pesticide exposure is probably not a cause of glioma, though a minority of <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> found an association.|$|R
