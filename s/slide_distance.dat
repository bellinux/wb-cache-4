40|$|Abstract: In many {{motorcycle}} accidents, {{the motorcycle}} {{falls to the}} ground and slides to rest following impact or loss of control. The determination of the motorcycle speed just prior to ‘fall-over ’ is important for biomechanics research and for litigation. This paper presents a new model of motorcycle fall-over and slide, which accounts for the loss of horizontal momentum resulting from the initial motorcycle-to-ground impact and the subsequent slide to rest. The model includes cases involving motorcycle fall-over owing to loss of control as well as impact. The models represent both the mean and variation present in the available experimental data for dry roads very well and are used to develop confidence limits for accident reconstruction purposes, in cases where only the motorcycle <b>slide</b> <b>distance</b> along the ground is known. Previously proposed confidence limit criteria are applied to predicting motorcycle speed ranges from <b>slide</b> <b>distance,</b> and it is shown that the level of prediction uncertainty can be substantially reduced in cases where additional information specific to the vehicle and road configurations is available...|$|E

In this study, a pre-event TerraSAR-X image of Tohoku area, taken on Oct. 21, 2010 and three post-event images taken on March 13, 24 and April 4, 2011 were used to estimate the constant crustal movements by a subpixel level area-based matching method.

The sand is prepared and added in weight percentage of 1 % and 2 %. It is grain size ranges between 50 - 75 um. Wettability of the mixture was increased by adding 2 gm of pure magnesium. A special electric mixer {{was used to}} disperse silica sand grains to support aluminum scrap melt (matrix). Then the composite pieces were cut to samples suitable for tension, compression, hardness, wear, impact, corrosion resistance (in sea water) and microstructure inspection. The tests {{have shown that the}} composite has more resistance to tension, compression, hardness, and wear than the base alloy. This is because sand particles are dispersed uniformly (uniformly distributed throughout the cast) which hinder the movement of the dislocations slip plane.

In wear resistance test, pin-on-desk was used where load, sliding speed, and <b>slide</b> <b>distance</b> were kept constant.

According to wear theory, contact pressure and <b>sliding</b> <b>distance</b> {{are the two}} dominant factors in determining sliding wear. We applied the finite element analysis to accurately quantify the contact pressure and <b>sliding</b> <b>distance</b> at the die radius in sheet metal stamping. The results were then applied to analyze sliding wear at the die radius. We found that a typical two-peak steady-state contact pressure response exists during a channel forming process. The steady-state contact pressure response was preceded by an initial transient response, which produced extremely large and localized contact pressures. We proposed a method to numerically quantify the <b>sliding</b> <b>distance,</b> which was applied to examine the contact <b>sliding</b> <b>distance</b> at the die radius.

40|$|Values {{of charge}} {{transfer}} integrals, spatial overlap integrals and site energies involved in transport of positive charges along columnar stacked triphenylene derivatives are provided. These parameters were calculated directly as the matrix {{elements of the}} Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian, {{defined in terms of}} the molecular orbitals on individual triphenylene molecules. This was realized by exploiting the unique feature of the Amsterdam density functional theory program that allows one to use molecular orbitals on individual molecules as a basis set in calculations on a system composed of two or more molecules. The charge transfer integrals obtained in this way differ significantly from values estimated from the energy splitting between the highest occupied molecular orbitals in a dimer. The difference is due to the nonzero spatial overlap between the molecular orbitals on adjacent molecules. Calculations were performed on unsubstituted and methoxy- or methylthio-substituted triphenylenes. Charge transfer integrals and site energies were computed {{as a function of the}} twist angle, stacking distance and lateral <b>slide</b> <b>distance</b> between adjacent molecules. The variation of the charge transfer integrals and site energies with these conformational degrees of freedom provide a qualitative explanation of the similarities and differences between the experimental charge carrier mobilities in different phases of alkoxy- and alkylthio-substituted triphenylenes.
