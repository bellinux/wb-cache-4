40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{importance}} of getting workers involved in safety and health issues at work. Since modernisation and industrialisation have led to human loss and tragedy all around the world due to industrial accidents, safety practitioners and observers have widely agreed that the traditional belief that employers are solely responsible for the workers’ safety at work should have a new paradigm. To create a <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> <b>condition,</b> workers should be allowed to participate actively in safety and health matters and cooperate with the employers. Since they are closer to their work, it is felt that the workers themselves are the most qualified to make decisions about safety and job improvements. Evidence showed that various benefits could be yielded if workers work together with employers including the reduction of death and injury rates at work. However, to make workers’ participation in this field effective, several criteria are crucial. They are the legal support, management support, trade union support, training and the positive quality of the workers involved...|$|E

40|$|Bord and pillar {{method is}} the most widely practiced {{underground}} mining method in India. Nevertheless about 61 % of underground coal mining accidents are due to roof and side fall of bord and pillar. Design of systematic support is essential to avoid strata control problem and to provide <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> <b>condition.</b> Three distinct methodologies; empirical approach, numerical modeling and field monitoring were followed and compared in the project to provide a comprehensive design of systematic support. A case study of 1 AS 2 panel of RK- 6 Incline, SCCL is chosen {{for the design of}} systematic support. The empirical design of support is developed using RMR and Q-system and validated with numerical modeling and field monitoring. The systematic support developed by RMR with factor of safety greater than 2 for the gallery was 1. 5 m spacing of 1. 8 m full column grouted bolts with spacing of 1. 4 m between rows. Junction support was 33 % extra full column grouted bolts. Systematic support designed for slices and goaf edges with Q-System was skin to skin chocks with corner props and breaker line bolt with 1 m spacing. Maximum convergence measured with telescopic convergence rod in the field at the station 6 F- 57 LS was 48 mm. Maximum deformations observed by numerical modeling in the gallery was 58 mm. The numerical model was almost validated with the field monitoring data with 17 % approximation, thus the numerical model can be used for prediction of strata behavior of future working...|$|E

Safety when working in presence of electricity is a universal goal. Finding practical methods to achieve this safety, however, is not always easy or obvious. Maintenance personnel must take the necessary steps to assure that the system or portion of the system on which they plan to work is in an electrically <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> <b>condition</b> [11. The accepted, reliable way to provide safety is to de-energize the equipment first, then to connect the equipment to ground so that it cannot be reenergized. If there is no electrical power, there is no risk of electrical injury. Complexity of the electrical system normally determines the level of detail planning required for system clearing procedures. Complex power distribution systems that may have several sources into an area require several switching steps to isolate a portion of the system. It is necessary to use more elaborate clearing procedures and written switching instructions for systems together with a single-line diagram [l]. The instructions and/or procedures should include verifying that the power has been removed (by live line testing or other means,) followed by the placing of grounds and locking/tagging of isolating devices(l 1. The clearing procedures should be completely written, checked and understood by all persons involved before applying them to any portion of the power distribution system.

40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, mine {{backfilling}} has progressively integrated into underground mining operations. The high stresses associated with mining at depth in the Canadian Shield, also requires innovative approaches to mine backfilling to withstand the loading both during and after mining operations. Not only new or modified minefill systems are required, but also new techniques are needed {{to increase the speed}} of the mining cycle for optimizing the mining operation. Three major purposes of mine backfill are known as (1) providing <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> <b>condition,</b> (2) maximizing ore recovery and (3) improving underground stability. Therefore, mine backfill has contributed greatly to the economics and environmental aspects of mining industry. In order to improve the mechanical behaviour of fill, cementitious materials are used. These cementitious materials are expensive. As a result the consumption of these cementitious materials has to be optimized and minimized {{in a way that the}} required strength is met. The objective of this research is to investigate a new type of backfill, which is known as gelfill. Gelfill binders usually consist of alkali activators such as sodium silicate and the other cementitious materials. Sodium silicate has been used in waste treatment and activation of artificial pozzolans such as blast furnace slag and fly ash. The work presented in this thesis is to evaluate the use of sodium silicate in gelfill. Consequently, the influence of mixing time, mixing sequence and curing time are studied on gelfill and silica sand hydraulic backfill. Various tests including unconfined and confined compressive strength were conducted in order to investigate the mechanical behaviour of samples. By conducting mercury intrusion porosimetery (MIP) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), microstructure and mineralogical properties of specimens were studied. The result of this thesis demonstrates that gelfill compared with silica sand hydraulic backfill has better mechanical properties. In addition, other variables, including: mixing time and sequence, have a significant effect on gelfill...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MEd (Education Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 The concept {{duty of care}} {{is defined}} as heedful, careful guarding, {{supervision}} of a minor, and/or overseeing. An obligation rests on teachers to scrupulously see to the safety (and also the well-being) of all learners entrusted to them. Hence teachers {{are responsible for the}} physical safety of learners and for creating a safe haven for them. The Civil Technology workshop teacher has an increased caring duty towards his learners due to the potential life-threatening circumstances and conditions that can prevail in his workshop compared to, for instance, the ordinary classroom environment. Furthermore, a specific legal duty rests on a person when he is placed in control of dangerous objects or machinery, seeing that he has {{to see to it that}} he ensures the safety of others through positive action. Internationally, the circular saw is statistically speaking seen to be the most dangerous woodwork machine in the Civil Technology workshop. Circular saws are responsible for more accidents than any other machine, and the most claims for damages against teachers and school managements also arise from it. Due to the underlying dangers inherent to circular saws and the presence thereof in Civil Technology workshops, it increases the risks attached to the caring supervision duty of the Civil Technology teacher to a great extent. Civil Technology workshop teachers are therefore confronted by unique challenges in their workshops. Hence it is essential that they be equipped with sufficient knowledge pertaining to educational law so as to make head against these challenges. Civil Technology workshop teachers should therefore not only be aware of all common law principles, relevant legislation and case law as applicable to workshops, but also be able to apply it in practice in the workshop environment. This practical application furthermore requires workshop teachers to be knowledgeable to be able to maintain workshop machinery in a <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> <b>condition</b> through regular upkeep and maintenance. An empirical investigation (n= 38) was launched, based on a questionnaire filled in by all Civil Technology teachers and their heads of department North West where Civil Technology is presented as a choice subject at high schools. The aim of the empirical investigation was to determine: * what the level of Civil Technology workshop teachers‘ expertise and knowledge is regarding legal key issues concerning their caring supervising duty, and * to what extent effective safety management of woodwork machinery in Civil Technology workshops is applied. The empirical investigation found, amongst others, that: * The respondents do not have sufficient knowledge of the principles pertaining to educational law to apply it in the Civil Technology workshops of the study population practically. * Civil Technology workshop teachers and heads of department should have a high degree of expertise with a view to execute their duty of care. Poor educational law training can possibly be proffered as reason why their level of expertise cannot be seen to be sufficient in a case where an increased level of duty of car is required in potentially dangerous workshops. Following on above-mentioned findings, specific recommendations were made to all role-players involved that are involved in learner safety in Civil Technology workshops. These recommendations may possibly contribute to increased and more effective caring supervision in promoting learner safety. Master...|$|E
