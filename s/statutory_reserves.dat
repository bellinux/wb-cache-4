40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{recent changes in}} the U.

Since 1990, reductions in <b>statutory</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements have significantly reduced {{the importance of the}} requirements as a constraint on the deposit and lending behavior of banks and other depository institutions. During the same period, depositories' interbank payments activities have come to determine most, if not all of their, demand for Federal Reserve Bank deposits. Our analysis suggests that measures of the monetary source base should be broadened to include all Federal Reserve deposits held by domestic depository institutions rather than just those deposits available to satisfy <b>statutory</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements, and that adjustments for the effects of changes in reserve requirements must recognize that many depositories' behavior is not affected by such requirements.

40|$|Deposits held at Federal Reserve Banks are an {{essential}} input {{to the business}} activity of most depository institutions in the United States. Managing these deposits is an important and complex inventory problem, for two reasons. First, Federal Reserve regulations require that depository institutions hold certain amounts of such deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks to satisfy <b>statutory</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements against customers* transaction accounts (demand deposits and other checkable deposits). Second, some inventory of such deposits is essential for banks to operate one of their core lines of business: furnishing payment services to households and firms. including wire transfers, ACH payments, and check clearing settlement. Because the Federal Reserve does not pay interest on such deposits used to satisfy <b>statutory</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements, banks seek to minimize their inventory of such deposits. In 1994, the banking industry introduced a new inventory management tool for such deposits, the retail deposit sweep program, which avoids the statutory requirement by reclassifying transaction deposits as savings deposits. In this analysis, we examine two algorithms for operating such sweeps programs {{within the limits of}} Federal Reserve regulations. Banks and banking; Retail trade...|$|R

The revised measure of the adjusted reserves component differs from the current measure by including the aggregate amount of depository institutions' required clearing balance contracts with the Federal Reserve. The new RAM differs from the current RAM by recognizing that, since the Monetary Control Act of 1980, an increasing number of depository institutions have not significantly changed their demand for base money (vault cash and Federal Reserve deposits) relative to transactions deposits following changes in <b>statutory</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements.

40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{conditions for}} the extraction of useful minerals require {{the formation of a}} working zone of work sites that include <b>statutory</b> <b>reserves</b> of rock and rock masses, ready to be removed. The increase of an open-cast performance by ore leads to increase of width of the work sites. In this case the volume of open-cut mining is growing, both due to a short-term increase in the speed of horizontal promotion of each upstream horizon, and due to changes in the mode of mining operations. The aim of the work is the improvement of methods for determining the volume of open-cut mining ensured normal conditions of the extraction of useful minerals with the change in its performance. We derived formulas for determining the current coefficients of open-cut mining in the expansion of work areas, as well as the volume of debt for opening. Calculations showed that due to an increase in the performance of the open-cast by ore, the open-cut mining ratio also increases, both by reducing the angle of the open pit slope and due to a short-term increase in the speed of horizontal promotion of each upstream horizon relative to downstream, {{as a result of the}} expansion of work sites. Application of methods is possible in the case when mining under project open-cast flanks on day level, and in the case of abandonment of mining in the case of outperformance of working flanks on the project ones. ...|$|E
40|$|Demand {{and supply}} of money plays an {{important}} role in monetary policy in every economy. In a closed economy, the demand and {{supply of money}} is influenced by the behavior of banks and the public. Being in an open economy, influenced by the amount of income, the ratio of trade through the influence of interest rates and increasing trend in the general price level continuously over time from a country. This study aims to see the effect of real income, interest rate, reserve requirement and the minimum level of consumer prices to the demand and supply of money in Indonesia. Processing of data using quantitative data and descriptive empirical models of money demand is a function of real income, interest rates and general price level. While the empirical model of the money supply is a function of high-powered money. This study examines the mechanisms and magnitude of the effect of real income, interest rates, general price levels, statutory minimum, and the stock of money in a broad sense over the period 1990 to 2010. By using simultaneous equations Two-Stage Least Square (2 SLS), suggesting that the effect of general price level has positive and significant, real income is positive but not significant effect, the interest rate a negative and significant effect on the demand and supply of money in Indonesia. Meanwhile, the stock of money in the importance and the general price level has positive and significant, and the statutory minimum level of real income a negative and no significant effect on interest rates.   _________________________________ Keywords:Demand and Money Supply, Interest Rate, <b>Statutory</b> <b>Reserves,</b> Real Income, Stock Exchange in the broadest sense, the General Price Level...|$|E
40|$|Sustained {{very high}} rate of growth (above 8 % in the context today in India) {{would be able to}} achieve (since a labour {{productivity}} growth of 4 to 4. 5 % is to be factored in) a labour absorption rate of 3. 5 to 4 % which is about a percent above the growth in the rate of the workforce. But slower growth of around 6 % which is what India seems to be achieving in the 90 s on an average would keep disguised unemployment alive for long. Similarly, the transformation of firms and especially SMEs which have little autonomous capacity is itself a function of growth oriented policies. In the nineties labour has been sufficiently flexible to allow rapid growth whenever demand was high. In any case the unorganised workers, did not have the ability to resist hire and fire. Demand has been lower than possible otherwise since the rupee especially in comparison to the East Asian currencies has not been aggressively priced. Lacking a very rapid growth in the market sufficient to overcome disguised unemployment, the transformation of these industries has itself been affected. Similarly the continuation of tariff inversion, high and uncompensated energy taxes hurt manufacturing and especially the small and medium sector whose dependence on relative factor cost is higher. The slow movement towards de-reservation has further attenuated the process. The dynamic inefficiencies and distortions are far more significant than the static efficiency penalty that the economy pays in the continuation of reservation. Without these corrections the move to have “free-trade” agreements with the ASEAN countries would hurt manufacturing in India and especially the SMEs. Many of the traditional small firms are in clusters, and a cluster oriented approach would be important for their success. A strategy based on leveraging trade names /brand names, many of which could be argued to be "geographic indicators", with much equity world wide, would require immediate changes in our intellectual property rights regime. Costs of excise registration and dealing with excise authorities are too large, and there is a fixed component to this cost which cannot be spread over a large value of turnover. Only significantly lower excise rates for small firms could compensate them sufficiently. The criteria of "with and without the use of power" in the Factories Act, be entirely dispensed with. All units with more than 50 employees including the entrepreneur and family labour, be brought /retained under (all) the provisions of the Factories Act. And all other units be entirely exempt from its provisions. Credit {{is the single most important}} constraint for small firms. Incentivisation of priority sector targets is the solution. The policy of directed lending to small firms (the targets for priority sector lending) ought to shift from targets or quotas to incentives to banks for lending to small firms. Responsible risk taking in lending would have to re-emerge. Tax based incentives for banks and financial intermediaries are possible. <b>Statutory</b> <b>Reserves</b> based incentives for banks too are possible. Concessions on interest rates are dysfunctional, though the margin above PLR rates ought to be subject to a ceiling. State Finance Corporations which could play a crucial role in financing of SMEs would have to go through quick restructuring and refocus on promotion of new enterprises typically where vast positive external effects are anticipated, such as in technology based small firms, promising industries, nodal industries, industrial estate corporations, in exchanging specific infrastructural support to existing clusters of small firms, etc. Investments in infrastructure especially general roads, power, railways, and water supply would help to improve the performance of small firms significantly. For all small firms power and water continue to remain constraints shamefully after nearly 10 years of reform. These can easily come down at least for export industries if the taxes and cross subsidies on them are made vattable. Despite the Electricity Act 2003, it is shameful that open-access has not been extended to SMEs. Technology based and skill labour using industries such as IT, BT, pharmaceuticals and auto oriented industries, also need to be exploited. In automobiles taxes are still very large and the inverted tariffs / high cost of materials and energy that are uncompensated hurt the prospects of India emerging as a base for manufactures. In IT, Biotechnology, pharmaceutical industries and other related offshoring activities the challenges lie in bringing about better IPR regimes that reduces the risk faced by foreign firms in their operations in India. IPR regimes requiring much insight would have to be worked work out that is able to balance the interest of Indian firms and yet lead to much industrial relocation. The addition of a petty patent register could considerably enhance the extraction of value from the many innovations that take place in the SME sector. Municipal infrastructure is inadequate and its correction in at least a few cities is of crucial importance to the growth of the off-shoring activities and growth in these industries. Financial institutions could usefully develop strong venture capital arms to finance innovative small firms that have a good potential to emerge in the near future in many industries. Problems with government procurement which are designed to fail keeps alive a very large market for shoddy goods among SMEs. Merging of the umpteen laws and regulations into one wherever feasible can reduce the currently large costs of SMEs in dealing with government. ...|$|E
