However, the theft of portable gauges is still a concern if the gauge is abandoned in the environment, is recycled in a steel mill, or is used inappropriately.

However, these conveniences may come at the cost of physical <b>security</b> since <b>portable</b> devices are often operated in a public environment where there is a possibility of being physically exposed or obtained by untrustworthy users. While it is a common practice to secure the data that is transferred from one point to another, the contents of system memory often go unprotected.

Using <b>portable</b> eye tracking glasses, 40 security screeners were observed in the field as they performed search, examination and interface interactions during airport security x-ray screening. Data from semi structured interviews was used to further explore the nature of visual and physical interactions.

As experience is gained, security screeners are found to perform search, examination and interface interactions more intuitively.

This inference was made based on the dominant processing styles associated with search and examination activities. The paper concludes by discussing the implications that this research has for the design of visual and physical interfaces.

40|$|In this work, radial {{transitions}} {{have been}} successfully mated with a HEMT-based MMIC (high-electron-mobility-transistor-based monolithic microwave integrated circuit) oscillator circuit. The chip has been assembled into a WR 2. 2 waveguide module for the basic implementation with radial E-plane probe transitions to convert the waveguide mode to the MMIC coplanar waveguide mode. The E-plane transitions have been directly integrated onto the InP substrate to couple the submillimeter-wave energy directly to the waveguides, thus avoiding wire-bonds in the RF path. The oscillator demonstrates a measured 1. 7 percent DC-RF efficiency at the module level. The oscillator chip uses 35 -nm-gate-length HEMT devices, which enable the high frequency of oscillation, creating the first demonstration of a packaged waveguide oscillator that operates over 300 GHz {{and is based on}} InP HEMT technology. The oscillator chip is extremely compact, with dimensions of only 1. 085 x 320 sq mm for a total die size of 0. 35 sq mm. This fully integrated, waveguide oscillator module, with an output power of 0. 27 mW at 330 GHz, can provide low-mass, low DC-power-consumption alternatives to existing local oscillator schemes, which require high DC power consumption and large mass. This oscillator module can be easily integrated with mixers, multipliers, and amplifiers for building high-frequency transmit and receive systems at submillimeter wave frequencies. Because it requires only a DC bias to enable submillimeter wave output power, it is a simple and reliable technique for generating power at these frequencies. Future work will be directed to further improving the applicability of HEMT transistors to submillimeter wave and terahertz applications. Commercial applications include submillimeter-wave imaging systems for hidden weapons detection, airport security, homeland <b>security,</b> and <b>portable</b> low-mass, low-power imaging system...|$|R

These methods can help to mitigate the harm done by a malicious attacker who has already gained a partial access into the system. The main focus in the thesis is to give an idea how attacks can be pursued and how to protect against them. The first research question is: What proactive steps can be done to reduce errors and vulnerabilities in code before it is released? What methods can be adapted to harden the code and make it less penetrable? I examine a few design principles which are known to be good against malicious activities. The second research question is: What is the state of the static analyzers in modern compilers, when compared to dedicated static analyzers?
