25|$|The (spinal cord) {{dorsal horn}} neurons {{give rise to}} the spinothalamic tract (STT), which {{constitutes}} the major ascending nociceptive pathway. As a consequence of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>activity</b> arising in the periphery, STT neurons develop increased background activity, enlarged receptive fields and increased responses to afferent impulses, including normally innocuous tactile stimuli. This phenomenon is called central sensitization. Central sensitization is an important mechanism of persistent neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|After a nerve lesion {{of either}} C fibers or Aδ fibers, they become {{abnormally}} sensitive and cause pathological <b>spontaneous</b> <b>activity.</b> This alteration of normal activity {{is explained by}} molecular and cellular changes of the primary afferent nociceptors {{in response to the}} nerve damage. The abnormal activity of the damaged nerves is associated with the increased presence of mRNA for voltage-gated sodium channels. Irregular grouping of these channels in sites of the abnormal activity may be responsible for lowering the activation threshold, thus leading to hyperactivity.|$|E
25|$|In {{experiments}} where nerve {{injury is}} caused but nearby C fibers remain intact, increased <b>spontaneous</b> <b>activity</b> in the C fibers is observed. This phenomenon supports {{the theory that}} damaged nerve fibers may release factors that alter the function of neighboring undamaged fibers. Study of Remak bundles has important implications in nerve regeneration after sustaining injury. Currently, recovery of distal C fiber function takes months and may still only regain incomplete function. This may result in abnormal sensory function or neuropathic pain. Remak bundles are thought to release certain trophic factors that promote the regeneration of the damaged axons.|$|E

25|$|Phase {{resetting}} also {{permits the}} study of evoked activity, a term used in electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography for responses in brain activity that {{are directly related to}} stimulus-related activity. Evoked potentials and event-related potentials are obtained from an electroencephalogram by stimulus-locked averaging, i.e. averaging different trials at fixed latencies around the presentation of a stimulus. As a consequence, those signal components that are the same in each single measurement are conserved and all others, i.e. ongoing or <b>spontaneous</b> <b>activity,</b> are averaged out. That is, event-related potentials only reflect oscillations in brain activity that are phase-locked to the stimulus or event.

40|$|The {{locus coeruleus}} (LC) {{is a group}} of {{norepinephrine}} (NE) -containing neurons that shows marked NE depletion when rats are exposed to uncontrollable shock. The depletion of NE in the LC region results in an increase in burst-firing of LC neurons. Evidence indicates that an increase in burst-firing of LC neurons results in a decrease in motor activity. Intraperitoneal (ip) administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, also causes an increase in burst-firing of LC neurons, apparently via the induction of interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) in the brain. Ip LPS also results in a decrease in <b>spontaneous</b> motor <b>activity</b> in rats, a behavior that expressed in “sickness behavior. ” However, a causal relationship between an increase in burst-firing of LC neurons and a decrease in <b>spontaneous</b> motor <b>activity</b> after ip LPS has not yet been established. Therefore, this manuscript examines the effect of IL- 1 acting within the LC region on producing an aspect of sickness behavior - a decrease in <b>spontaneous</b> motor <b>activity</b> — that is seen after ip LPS. We hypothesize that the decrease in <b>spontaneous</b> motor <b>activity</b> that occurs after an injection of ip LPS is mediated by the induction of IL- 1 in the LC region. Several experiments conducted measured <b>spontaneous</b> motor <b>activity</b> as affected by 1) ip LPS, 2) LPS infused into the LC region or 3) IL- 1 infused into the LC or LC surrounding regions. A final experiment tested whether interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (IL-lra) infused into the LC region would block the decrease in <b>spontaneous</b> motor <b>activity</b> in response to an injection of ip LPS. The results showed that a range of ip LPS doses (5 - 20 pg/kg), a range of LPS doses (0. 1 - 4. 0 ng/rat) or a range of IL-lp doses (0. 1 - 40 ng/rat) infused into the LC region all decreased <b>spontaneous</b> motor <b>activity</b> in a dose-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, an infusion of IL-ip (0. 4 ng/rat) into LC surrounding regions did not significantly decrease <b>spontaneous</b> motor <b>activity</b> differently from an infusion of IL-ip (0. 4 ng/rat) into the LC region. Finally, central IL-lra (40 pg/rat) was unable to block or affect the decrease in <b>spontaneous</b> motor <b>activity</b> seen after an injection of ip LPS (10 pg/kg). Collectively, the findings do not support the hypothesis that the decrease in <b>spontaneous</b> motor <b>activity</b> that occurs after an injection of ip LPS is mediated by the induction of IL- 1 in the LC region. Although LPS infused into the LC region or IL-ip infused into the LC region decreased <b>spontaneous</b> motor <b>activity,</b> IL-lra was unable to block the decrease in <b>spontaneous</b> motor <b>activity</b> seen after an injection of ip LPS...|$|R
25|$|Electrodiagnostic testing {{can help}} {{distinguish}} myopathies from neuropathies, {{which can help}} determine the course of further work-up. Most of the electrodiagnostic abnormalities seen in myopathies are also seen in neuropathies (nerve disorders). Electrodiagnostic abnormalities common to myopathies and neuropathies include; abnormal <b>spontaneous</b> <b>activity</b> (e.g., fibrillations, positive sharp waves, etc.) on needle EMG and, small amplitudes of the motor responses compound muscle action potential, or CMAP during nerve conduction studies. Many neuropathies, however, cause abnormalities of sensory nerve studies, whereas myopathies involve only the muscle, with normal sensory nerves. The most important factor distinguishing a myopathy from a neuropathy on needle EMG is the careful analysis of the motor unit action potential (MUAP) size, shape, and recruitment pattern.|$|E
25|$|During {{exocytosis}} at the bipolar ribbon synapse, vesicles {{are seen}} to pause at the membrane and then upon opening of the calcium channels to promptly release their contents within milliseconds. Like most exocytosis, Ca2+ regulates the release of vesicles from the presynaptic membrane. Different types of ribbon synapses have different dependence on Ca2+ releases. The hair cell ribbon synapses exhibit a steep dependence on Ca2+ concentration, while the photoreceptor synapses is less steeply dependent on Ca2+ and is stimulated by much lower levels of free Ca2+. The hair cell ribbon synapse experiences <b>spontaneous</b> <b>activity</b> {{in the absence of}} stimuli, under conditions of a constant hair cell membrane potential. Voltage clamp at the postsynaptic bouton showed that the bouton experiences a wide range of excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes. The current amplitude distribution is a positive-skew, with a range of larger amplitudes for both spontaneous and stimulus evoked release. It was thought that this current distribution was not explainable with single vesicle release, and other scenarios of release have been proposed: coordinated multivesicular release, kiss-and-run, or compound fusion of vesicles prior to exocytosis. However it has been recently proposed that uniquantal release with fusion pore flickering is the most plausible interpretation of the found current distribution. In fact, the charge distribution of currents is actually normally distributed, supporting the uniquantal release scenario. It has been shown that the skewness of the current amplitude distribution is well explained by different time courses of neurotransmitter release of a single vesicles with a flickering fusion pore.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Spontaneous</b> <b>{{activity}}</b> is {{brain activity}} {{in the absence of}} an explicit task, such as sensory input or motor output, and hence also referred to as resting-state activity. It is opposed to induced activity, i.e. brain activity that is induced by sensory stimuli or motor responses. [...] The term ongoing brain activity is used in electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography for those signal components that are not associated with the processing of a stimulus or the occurrence of specific other events, such as moving a body part, i.e. events that do not form evoked potentials/evoked fields, or induced activity. <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>activity</b> is usually considered to be noise if one is interested in stimulus processing; however, <b>spontaneous</b> <b>activity</b> is considered to play a crucial role during brain development, such as in network formation and synaptogenesis. [...] <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>activity</b> may be informative regarding the current mental state of the person (e.g. wakefulness, alertness) and is often used in sleep research. Certain types of oscillatory activity, such as alpha waves, are part of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>activity.</b> Statistical analysis of power fluctuations of alpha activity reveals a bimodal distribution, i.e. a high- and low-amplitude mode, and hence shows that resting-state activity does not just reflect a noise process. In case of fMRI, spontaneous fluctuations in the Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal reveal correlation patterns that are linked to resting states networks, such as the default network. The temporal evolution of resting state networks is correlated with fluctuations of oscillatory EEG activity in different frequency bands.|$|E
