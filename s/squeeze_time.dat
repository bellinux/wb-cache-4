40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ability to}} produce near net shape {{components}} is made possible by means of squeeze casting process. Squeeze casting is a hybrid metal forming process which combines the features of both casting and forging in a single operation. The primary objective {{of this paper is}} to study the influence of the process parameters on wear resistance in squeeze casting of LM 6 Al-flyash composite using Taguchi method. The parameters studied include percentage wt. of flyash, squeeze pressure, and <b>squeeze</b> <b>time.</b> In Taguchi method, a four level orthogonal array has been used to determine the S/N ratio. In this investigation, composites have been produced by incorporating flyash as a reinforcement material and eutectic Al–Si alloy as a matrix. Stir casting route has been adopted to disperse fly ash (from 5 % to 12. 5 %wt.) in the Al–Si alloy matrix which is followed by applying the squeeze pressure of 30, 60, 90 and 120 bar for a varying <b>squeeze</b> <b>time.</b> The Pin-ondisc test was conducted on the specimen prepared out of these castings to determine the sliding wear behavior of the composite. The results of experimental investigation on wear resistance of flyash reinforced aluminium metal matrix composite shows that the inclusion of the flyash by weight percentage and the squeeze pressure are the recognized parameters to cause appreciable improvement in the wear resistance of the squeeze cast components...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a theoretical {{analysis of the}} effects of surface roughness in squeeze film lubrication of spherical bearings. The analysis is based on a deterministic theory of hydrodynamic lubrication. The important squeeze film parameters are obtained as simple closed form expressions for roughness types. The generalized Reynolds equation accounting for the surface roughness is considered and it is applied to study the effects of roughness in squeeze film lubrication of spherical bearings. In order to get the expression for pressure, the generalized Reynolds equation is solved. Then by making use of this expression we obtain the expression for load carrying capacity, which in turn is used to find the expression for response time. These expressions are numerically computed and the results are presented graphically. From the numerical computations of the results, it is found that, the load capacity and <b>squeezing</b> <b>time</b> increases with an increase of peripheral viscosity of the lubricant.

In squeeze casting, {{the relationship between the}} process parameters {{and the quality of the}} squeeze cast components is not fully understood; thus the need for more studies in this area of technology for better understanding of the process. The present work encompasses studying the effect of direct squeeze casting process parameters on the production of (3 and 20 ٪) volume fraction carbon fibers (CF) reinforced Al-Si matrix composites. The evaluated process parameters are squeeze pressure in the range (7. 5 - 53) MPa, die preheating temperature (100, 200, 300) °C, pouring temperature (700, 780) °C, <b>squeeze</b> <b>time</b> (30 sec.), and delay time (5 sec.).

Increasing the carbon fibers volume fraction had led to increasing the tensile strength. The using of higher pressure (53 MPa), lower pouring temperature (700 °C), and lower die temperature (200 °C) have increased the ultimate tensile strength of the CF/Al-Si composites to (183 MPa) when compared to that of the non-reinforced alloy which was (168 MPa) because of the increased bonding, decreased shrinkage defects and fibers degradation based on the results.
