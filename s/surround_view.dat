40|$|Understanding the {{surrounding}} {{environment of the}} vehicle {{is still one of}} the challenges for autonomous driving. This paper addresses 360 -degree road scene semantic segmentation using <b>surround</b> <b>view</b> cameras, which are widely equipped in existing production cars. First, in order to address large distortion problem in the fisheye images, Restricted Deformable Convolution (RDC) is proposed for semantic segmentation, which can effectively model geometric transformations by learning the shapes of convolutional filters conditioned on the input feature map. Second, in order to obtain a large-scale training set of <b>surround</b> <b>view</b> images, a novel method called zoom augmentation is proposed to transform conventional images to fisheye images. Finally, an RDC based semantic segmentation model is built. The model is trained for real-world <b>surround</b> <b>view</b> images through a multi-task learning architecture by combining real-world images with transformed images. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the RDC to handle images with large distortions, and the proposed approach shows a good performance using <b>surround</b> <b>view</b> cameras with the help of the transformed images.

40|$|Precise {{navigation}} map {{is crucial}} in many fields. This paper proposes a panorama based method to detect and recognize lane markings and traffic signs on the road surface. Firstly, {{to deal with the}} limited field of view and the occlusion problem, this paper designs a vision-based sensing system which consists of a <b>surround</b> <b>view</b> system and a panoramic system. Secondly, in order to detect and identify traffic signs on the road surface, sliding window based detection method is proposed. Template matching method and SVM (Support Vector Machine) are used to recognize the traffic signs. Thirdly, to avoid the occlusion problem, this paper utilities vision based ego-motion estimation to detect and remove other vehicles. As <b>surround</b> <b>view</b> images contain less dynamic information and gray scales, improved ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm is introduced to ensure that the ego-motion parameters are consequently obtained. For panoramic images, optical flow algorithm is used. The results from the <b>surround</b> <b>view</b> system help to filter the optical flow and optimize the ego-motion parameters; other vehicles are detected by the optical flow feature. Experimental results show that it can handle different kinds of lane markings and traffic signs well...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the performance}} of Modelica implemented state estimation algorithms for semi-active suspension control for the DLR ROboMObil (ROMO). In this approach the prediction model for the vertical dynamics state estimation and the tire contact force estimation is designed as a quarter vehicle model, which directly incorporates all relevant nonlinear parts. Based on this prediction model a square root unscented Kalman-filter (SR-UKF) is implemented, using the DLR Modelica Kalman-filter library and the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI). In a consecutive step this prediction model is extended by introducing an input port for road obstacle information, e. g. extracted from image data from ROMO 360 degree stereo <b>surround</b> <b>view.</b> The observer design and implementation on real-time hardware are performed in Modelica using the automated tool chain from the Modelica simulator to the Rapid Control Prototyping (RCP) hardware. Experimental results from a four post test-rig and simulations illustrate, that the estimation accuracy can be improved by the SR-UKF compared to an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based implementation...|$|E
40|$|Advanced driver {{assistance}} systems (ADAS) {{have been developed}} to automate and modify vehicles for safety and better driving experience. Among all computer vision modules in ADAS, 360 -degree <b>surround</b> <b>view</b> generation of immediate surroundings of the vehicle is very important, due to application in on-road traffic assistance, parking assistance etc. This paper presents a novel algorithm for fast and computationally efficient transformation of input fisheye images into required top down view. This paper also presents a generalized framework for generating top down view of images captured by cameras with fish-eye lenses mounted on vehicles, irrespective of pitch or tilt angle. The proposed approach comprises of two major steps, viz. correcting the fish-eye lens images to rectilinear images, and generating top-view perspective of the corrected images. The images captured by the fish-eye lens possess barrel distortion, for which a nonlinear and non-iterative method is used. Thereafter, homography is used to obtain top-down view of corrected images. This paper also targets to develop surroundings of the vehicle for wider distortion less field of view and camera perspective independent top down view, with minimum computation cost which is essential due to limited computation power on vehicles...|$|E

40|$|Panoramic images {{portray a}} <b>surround</b> <b>view</b> {{of the real}} world in one image. This kind of {{presentation}} however does, alike regular pictures, not give any real depth information. Deepness related relationships are only to be detected (within one image) by psychological cues like relative size, linear perspective and shadow. The relative distance between two features can only be retrieved by 1) stereoscopic measurement within two pictures or 2) by the integration of terrestrial laser scanning systems. In the second approach the photo is enhanced with information about the distance between each pixel and the location of image recording. If we visualize this cloud of ‘distance pixels ’ from a point of view chosen at the recording place through a panoramic perspective it will give us the impression of the original panoramic picture, but now with the added value of depth-related queries. This kind of ‘distance-value-added ’ panoramic pictures {{can be used as a}} base data model for 3 D-GIS visualizations. This paper concentrates on the database organization of RGB laser scan point clouds, the creation of virtual ‘distance-value-added ’ panoramic images out of these clouds, and the visualization and spatial analysis based on this kind of perceptive rich images. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{use of a}} multi-camera system {{enables a}} robot to obtain a <b>surround</b> <b>view,</b> and thus, {{maximize}} its perceptual awareness of its environment. An accurate calibration is a nec-essary prerequisite if vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) is expected to provide reliable pose estimates for a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) with a multi-camera system. On our MAV, we set up each camera pair in a stereo configuration. We propose a novel vSLAM-based self-calibration method for a multi-sensor system that includes multiple calibrated stereo cameras and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Our self-calibration estimates the transform with metric scale between each camera and the IMU. Once the MAV is calibrated, the MAV is able to estimate its global pose via a multi-camera vSLAM implementation based on the generalized camera model. We propose a novel minimal and linear 3 -point algorithm that uses inertial information to recover the relative motion of the MAV with metric scale. Our constant-time vSLAM implementation with loop closures runs on-board the MAV in real-time. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, no published work has demonstrated real-time on-board vSLAM with loop closures. We show experimental results in both indoor and outdoor environments.

If vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) is expected to provide reliable pose estimates for a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) with a multi-camera system, an accurate calibration of the multi-camera system is a necessary prerequisite. We propose a novel vSLAM-based self-calibration method for a multi-camera system that includes at least one calibrated stereo camera, and an arbitrary number of monocular cameras. We assume overlapping fields of view to only exist within stereo cameras. Our self-calibration estimates the inter-camera trans-forms with metric scale; metric scale is inferred from cal-ibrated stereo. On our MAV, we set up each camera pair in a stereo configuration which facilitates the estimation of the MAV’s pose with metric scale. Once the MAV is cal-ibrated, the MAV is able to estimate its global pose via a multi-camera vSLAM implementation based on the general-ized camera model. We propose a novel minimal and linear 3 -point algorithm that uses relative rotation angle measure-ments from a 3 -axis gyroscope to recover the relative mo-tion of the MAV with metric scale from 2 D- 2 D feature cor-respondences.
