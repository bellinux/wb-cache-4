25|$|The National Park Service {{chose to}} {{refinish}} the statues using brush electroplating. Workers discovered {{that because the}} interior of each pedestal was exposed to bare earth, excessive condensation built up inside the hollow statues. Additionally, the statues had not been completely seated on their plinths, and additional moisture worked its way inside through the poorly sealed joint. Extreme temperature changes (due to daytime heating and nighttime cooling of the bronze) and proximity to the river also led to extensive condensation inside the statures. Workers found the interior of each statue damp, even wet, and water pooled in every recess. The moisture build-up created tremendous galvanic corrosion inside the sculptures. The steel joint bolts were so extensively corroded that some had almost completely disintegrated, {{and many of the}} <b>steel</b> <b>angle</b> irons were close to failure. National Bureau of Standards workers believed all four statues {{were on the verge of}} structural collapse. The corrosion problem was worsened by the presence of gypsum. Gypsum was used to make the molds from which the bronze was cast. But the gypsum was never completely cleaned from the interior of the two The Arts of Peace statues, leading to additional corrosion in these pieces. The corrosion problems were solved by removing the steel bolts and angle irons and replacing them with bronze components, and by cleaning as much gypsum as possible from the statue interiors. More than 1,000 brass bolts were used in Music and Harvest and Aspiration and Literature alone.|$|E

40|$|The {{main problem}} facing steel {{structures}} is corrosion {{which could lead}} to the failure during operating conditions. With regard to this issue, there is growing focus to repair or rehabilitate corroded steel structures. This study investigates the possibility of strengthening corroded <b>steel</b> <b>angles</b> using Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP). The focus here is on tension angle members in truss type of steel structures. The loss of sectional area due to corrosion effect was represented by creating notches of different sizes (3 mm – 12 mm) in the angles. The effects of corrosion on tensile strength of artificially corroded <b>steel</b> <b>angles</b> were considered. The tensile characteristics of the CFRP strengthened-corroded <b>steel</b> <b>angles</b> were experimentally studied. The results revealed that CFRP is able to rehabilitate the corroded steel to a reasonable extent, i. e. there is high gain in the yield load which nearly reaches the original value of the angle member and reasonable improvement in tensile strength and ductility. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. High {{strength}} steel sections {{have been}} increasingly used in buildings and bridges, and <b>steel</b> <b>angles</b> {{have also been}} widely used in many steel structures, especially in transmission towers and long span trusses. However, high strength steel exhibits mechanical properties that are quite different from ordinary strength steel, and hence, the local buckling behavior of <b>steel</b> equal <b>angle</b> members under axial compression varies with the steel strength. However, {{there is a lack}} of research on the relationship of the local buckling behavior of <b>steel</b> equal <b>angle</b> members under axial compression with the steel strength. A finite element model is developed in this paper to analyze the local buckling behavior of <b>steel</b> equal <b>angle</b> members under axial compression, and study its relationship with the steel strength and the width-to-thickness ratio of the angle leg. The finite element analysis (FEA) results are compared with the corresponding design method in the American code AISC 360 - 05, which provides a reference for the related design...|$|R

Angle defended the title in this match against Henry. The match marked the first time that two former Olympians battled for a world title in history. Angle began the match in trying to put Henry down but instead Henry dumped him to the floor, where Angle was beaten by former manager Daivari. Henry controlled Angle using his power but Angle managed to apply the ankle lock. After Henry kicked out after an Angle Slam, Angle locked in an ankle lock once more. Daivari distracted the referee and when Henry broke the hold again, he sent Angle crashing into the referee. At that point, Kurt got a chair. Daivari tried to stop him but Angle hit Daivari with the chair. When Angle tried to use the chair, Henry blocked the attempt and tossed Angle to the mat. As Henry advanced though, Angle low blowed Henry, which was followed by two chair shots. Angle went for the pin but Henry kicked out. Angle untied one of the turnbuckle pads on the middle rope. Angle ended up in that corner, but as Henry charged, Angle sidestepped and tripped him into the exposed <b>steel.</b> <b>Angle</b> rolled up Henry to retain the World Heavyweight Championship but as Angle celebrated, there was all darkness and The Undertaker's music played.
