5|$|Lithium's {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion is {{twice that of}} aluminium and almost four times that of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at <b>standard</b> <b>pressure</b> and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures.|$|E
25|$|At room {{temperature}} and <b>standard</b> <b>pressure,</b> methane is a colorless, odorless gas. The familiar smell {{of natural gas}} as used in homes is achieved {{by the addition of}} an odorant, usually blends containing tert-butylthiol, as a safety measure. Methane has a boiling point of −161 °C (−257.8 °F) at a pressure of one atmosphere. As a gas it is flammable over a range of concentrations (5.4–17%) in air at <b>standard</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{boiling point}} {{corresponds}} to the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the surrounding environmental pressure. Thus, the boiling point {{is dependent on the}} pressure. Boiling points may be published with respect to the NIST, USA <b>standard</b> <b>pressure</b> of 101.325 kPa (or 1 atm), or the IUPAC <b>standard</b> <b>pressure</b> of 100.000 kPa. At higher elevations, where the atmospheric pressure is much lower, the boiling point is also lower. The boiling point increases with increased pressure up to the critical point, where the gas and liquid properties become identical. The boiling point cannot be increased beyond the critical point. Likewise, the boiling point decreases with decreasing pressure until the triple point is reached. The boiling point cannot be reduced below the triple point.|$|E

25|$|The {{phase of}} a {{substance}} is invariably determined by its energy and the energy of its surroundings. When the intermolecular forces of a substance are such that {{the energy of the}} surroundings is not sufficient to overcome them, it occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid {{as is the case with}} water (H2O); a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by hydrogen bonds.

25|$|Silicon crystallises {{in a giant}} {{covalent}} structure at standard conditions, {{specifically in}} a diamond cubic lattice. It thus has a high melting point of 1414°C. It is not known to have any allotropes at <b>standard</b> <b>pressure,</b> but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing coordination number with pressure, culminating in a hexagonal close-packed allotrope at about 40gigapascals known as Si–VII (the standard modification being Si–I). Silicon boils at 3265°C: this, while high, is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener carbon sublimes (3642°C) and silicon similarly has a lower heat of vaporisation than carbon, consistent {{with the fact that}} the Si–Si bond is weaker than the C–C bond.|$|E

25|$|Short path {{distillation}} is a distillation {{technique that}} involves the distillate travelling a short distance, often only a few centimeters, and is normally done at reduced pressure. A classic example would be a distillation involving the distillate travelling from one glass bulb to another, {{without the need for}} a condenser separating the two chambers. This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower (at reduced pressure) than the boiling point of the liquid at <b>standard</b> <b>pressure,</b> and the distillate only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A short path ensures that little compound is lost {{on the sides of the}} apparatus. The Kugelrohr is a kind of a short path distillation apparatus which often contain multiple chambers to collect distillate fractions.|$|E
