40|$|Certain {{geolocation}} parameters derived in {{the early}} analyses of SCIAMACHY's limb measurements deviated from the expected values. After a corrective action in the ENVISAT flight operation segment concerning state vector parameters the situation improved significantly. However small inconsistencies persisted. These include a still existing bias and a leftright asymmetry in the limb tangent heights. We assume that the inconsistencies originate in additional small line-of-sight misalignments. This view is supported by azimuth/elevation features observed in solar occultation and sub-solar measurements around times when scanner control is switched from prediction to <b>Sun</b> <b>Follower.</b> In a model approach we use these specific measurements of SCIAMACHY to quantitatively determine extra misalignments in pitch, roll and yaw. The approach uses the features in elevation and azimuth to simulate misalignment effects. The determined extra misalignments {{will be used in}} operational tangent height retrievals. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{precisely}} determine the viewing direction for solar occultation instruments from scans over the solar disk. Basic idea is the fit of the maximum intensity during the scan, which corresponds {{to the center of}} the solar disk in the scanning direction. We apply this method to the solar occultation measurements of the satellite instrument SCIAMACHY, which scans the Sun in elevation direction. The achieved mean precision is 0. 46 mdeg, which corresponds to an tangent height error of about 26 m for individual occultation sequences. The deviation of the derived elevation angle from the geolocation information given along with the product has a seasonal cycle with an amplitude of 2. 26 mdeg, which is in tangent height an amplitude of about 127 m. The mean elevation angle offset is − 4. 41 mdeg (249 m). SCIAMACHY's <b>sun</b> <b>follower</b> device controls the azimuth viewing direction during the occultation measurements. The derived mean azimuth direction has an standard error of 0. 65 mdeg, which is about 36 m in horizontal direction at the tangent point. We observe also a seasonal cycle of the azimuth mispointing with an amplitude of 2. 3 mdeg, which is slightly increasing with time. The almost constant mean offset is 88 mdeg, which is about 5. 0 km horizontal offset at the tangent point...|$|E
40|$|The SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) on Envisat (2002 – 2012) {{performed}} nadir, limb, solar/lunar occultation {{and various}} monitoring measurements. The pointing information {{of the instrument}} {{is determined by the}} attitude information of the Envisat platform with its star trackers together with the encoder readouts of both the azimuth and the elevation scanner of SCIAMACHY. In this work, we present additional sources of attitude information from the SCIAMACHY measurements itself. The basic principle is the same as used by the star tracker: we measure the viewing direction towards celestial objects, i. e. sun and moon, to detect possible mispointings. In sun over limb port observations, we utilise the vertical scans over the solar disk. In horizontal direction, SCIAMACHY's <b>sun</b> <b>follower</b> device (SFD) is used to adjust the viewing direction. Moon over limb port measurements use for both the vertical and the horizontal direction the adjustment by the SFD. The viewing direction is steered towards the intensity centroid of the illuminated part of the lunar disk. We use reference images from the USGS Robotic Lunar Observatory (ROLO) {{to take into account the}} inhomogeneous surface and the variations by lunar libration and phase to parameterise the location of the intensity centroid from the observation geometry. Solar observations through SCIAMACHY's so-called sub-solar port (with a viewing direction closely to zenith) also use the SFD in the vertical direction. In the horizontal direction the geometry of the port defines the viewing direction. Using these three type of measurements, we fit improved mispointing parameters by minimising the pointing offsets in elevation and azimuth. The geolocation of all retrieved products will benefit from this; the tangent heights are especially improved. The altitudes assigned to SCIAMACHY's solar occultation measurements are changed in the range of − 130 to − 330  m, the lunar occultation measurements are changed in the range of 0 to + 130  m and the limb measurements are changed in the range of − 50 to + 60  m (depending on season, altitude and azimuth angle). The horizontal location of the tangent point is changed by about 5  km for all measurements. These updates are implemented in version  9 of the SCIAMACHY Level 1 b products and Level 2 version 7 (based on L 1 b version 9) ...|$|E

The newspapers of the Cheekongtong and the Rixin Bao were in conflict with each other by the late 1900s and early 1910s; the former asked for revolution while the latter asked for reform without revolution. A revolution in China occurred in 1911. The Tai Hon Bo was, in 1914, renamed Tai Hon Kung Go ("Chinese Times"). In the 1970s Tai Hon Kung Bo was still in operation.|$|R

50|$|In Jiangdong, Sun Quan felt {{threatened}} by Cao Cao's approaching army and sent Lu Su to discuss forming {{an alliance with}} Liu Bei and Liu Qi against Cao Cao.

Sun Quan had 30,000 men at most while Liu Bei and Liu Qi's combined forces totaled about 10,000. In view of Cao Cao'soverwhelming forces, many of <b>Sun</b> Quan's <b>followers,</b> including Zhang Zhao, strongly advocated surrender. However, Sun Quan refused as he agreed with Zhou Yu and Lu Su's view that Cao Cao might not let him off even if he submitted. By late 208, with help from Zhou Yu and Lu Su (and Zhuge Liang, who represented Liu Bei in the diplomatic exchange), an alliance was formed between Sun Quan and Liu Bei against Cao Cao.|$|R
