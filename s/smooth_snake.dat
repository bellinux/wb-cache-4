25|$|About thirty {{species of}} snake occur in Egypt, {{about half of}} them venomous. These include the Egyptian cobra, false <b>smooth</b> <b>snake</b> and horned viper. There are also {{numerous}} species of lizards. Above the Aswan Dam, the shores of Lake Nasser are largely barren, but the lake does support the last remaining Nile crocodiles and African softshell turtle in Egypt.|$|E
25|$|The area of {{the site}} is , and {{comprises}} {{a significant amount of}} heath; the northern and western parts are primarily of the dry heath Calluna vulgaris and Erica cinerea, while the low-lying parts of the south-east are mostly the damp or humid heath Erica tetralix and Molinia caerulea. Rare heathland species include the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis), <b>smooth</b> <b>snake</b> (Coronella austriaca), heath grasshopper (Chorthippus vagansand) and the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata). Parley Common has an abundance of spider fauna—at least 147 species—which includes the very rare Ero aphana, Xysticus robustus—otherwise found in only a few places in the New Forest—and Gnaphosa lugubris. The site holds claim to a number of firsts: the <b>smooth</b> <b>snake</b> was first recorded in Britain in Parley Common in 1853; the Mazarine blue (Cyaniris semiargus)—now extinct in Britain—was first discovered here in the late nineteenth century; the moth Pachythelia villosella and the ringed carpet moth (Cleora cinctaria) were also first discovered here.|$|E

50|$|Reptiles that roam in {{this park}} include garter snake, red belly <b>snake,</b> ringneck <b>snake,</b> <b>smooth</b> green <b>snake,</b> wood turtle and {{leatherback}} sea turtle.|$|R
25|$|There are 12 reptile species, not {{counting}} the spur-thighed tortoise which breeds just outside the park's limits {{near the village of}} Pastra. The largest diversity is found in the lower zones— 10 species. Rila Monastery Forest Reserve is home to 5 reptile species. The population of the Aesculapian snake is of European importance. Of national importance are the populations of the slowworm, viviparous lizard, <b>smooth</b> <b>snake</b> and common European viper. The amphibians are represented with 11 species, with highest diversity in the wet deciduous forests and the forest streams. Rila Monastery Forest Reserve is the most important area for amphibians conservation. Three species have a population of national importance: the Alpine newt, yellow-bellied toad and common frog.|$|E
25|$|The area of {{the site}} is , and {{comprises}} {{a significant amount of}} heath—primarily the dry heath Calluna vulgaris and Erica cinerea, but locally dominant are the damp or humid heath Erica tetralix and Molinia caerulea. Rare heathland species include the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis), <b>smooth</b> <b>snake</b> (Coronella austriaca), heath grasshopper (Chorthippus vagansand) and the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata). Other local heathland species at Ferndown Common include the silver-studded blue butterfly (Plebejus argus), European nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) and European stonechat. In the south-east of the site there are several small ponds, which support at least 14 species of dragonflies, most of which are heathland species. Also resident in the ponds are large populations of the widespread, although in decline, common frog (Rana temporaria) and palmate newt (Triturus helveticus).|$|E
500|$|The River Frome, {{which forms}} the {{southern}} {{boundary of the}} parish, is designated by Natural England as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Southwest of the village and almost wholly within the parish is Puddletown Forest, which covers [...] and is managed by the Forestry Commission. The forest is {{on the edge of}} the Dorset Heaths Natural Area and some of the forest is being restored to heathland; the heath flora consists of Calluna, Ulex gallii, Ulex minor and bilberry; fauna includes the rare <b>smooth</b> <b>snake</b> and sand lizard. Close to Puddletown Forest are Yellowham Wood and Ilsington Wood, which are ancient woodland sites, though Ilsington Wood has significant conifer plantings.|$|E
50|$|The {{reptiles}} {{include the}} adder {{and the grass}} snake, the slowworm, which is a legless lizard, and the common lizard. <b>Smooth</b> <b>snakes,</b> found elsewhere in the UK are absent, and grass snakes are rarely reported.|$|R
40|$|Reptiles {{are declining}} {{in many parts}} of the world, mainly due to habitat loss and {{environmental}} change. A major factor in this is availability of suitable food. For many animals, dietary requirements shift during developmental stages and a habitat will only be suitable for conserving a species if it supports all stages. Conventional methods for establishing diet often rely on visual recognition of morphologically identifiable features of prey in faeces, regurgitation or stomach contents, which suffer from biases and poor resolution of taxa. DNA-based techniques facilitate noninvasive analysis of diet from faeces without these constraints. We tested the hypothesis that diet changes during growth stages of <b>smooth</b> <b>snakes</b> (Coronella austriaca), which have a highly restricted distribution in the UK but are widespread in continental Europe. Small numbers of the sympatric grass snake (Natrix natrix) were analysed for comparison. Faecal samples were collected from snakes and prey DNA analysed using PCR, targeting amphibians, reptiles, mammals and invertebrates. Over 85 % of <b>smooth</b> <b>snakes</b> were found to have eaten reptiles and 28 % had eaten mammals. Predation on mammals increased with age and was entirely absent among juveniles and subadults. Predation on reptiles did not change ontogenetically. <b>Smooth</b> <b>snakes</b> may, therefore, be restricted to areas of sufficiently high reptile densities to support young snakes...|$|R
