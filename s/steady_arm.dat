60|$|When the Second Lesson was ended, and {{the clergy}} and the choir, in their surplices, moved down to {{encircle}} the Font, {{it was as}} if they came to gather him in among them. Felix came and helped him up. He could stand now with one support, and this was his young godfather's right arm, to which he held tightly, but without any nervous convulsiveness--he was too happy for that now--during the prayers that entreated for his being safely gathered into the Ark, and the Gospel of admission into the Kingdom. He had an impulse to loose his clasp and stand alone at the beginning of the vows, but he could not; he had not withdrawn his hand before he was forced again to lean his weight upon the <b>steady</b> <b>arm</b> beside him.|$|E
5000|$|The adagio or adage (meaning [...] "slowly") {{part of a}} grand pas de deux {{features}} {{graceful and}} elaborate partnering by the dancing pair. In the adagio, the ballerina performs elegant, often slow and sustained movements while the danseur supports her. The danseur, in turn, strives to maintain a display of poise and seemingly effortless strength while providing support for the ballerina. The danseur may support the ballerina {{in a variety of}} common ways, including lifting her, holding and steadying her during turns, and offering a <b>steady</b> <b>arm</b> or hand for her to use as a [...] "virtual barre" [...] when she performs balancing feats that would be difficult or impossible without assistance. Because of this support the adagio is sometimes called supported adagio.|$|E
5000|$|Stir Brew is a brewing {{technique}} {{unique to}} Jack’s Coffee that involves stirring the ground beans throughout the drip process. Stirring oxygenates the blend and ensures {{that all the}} beans are utilized. [...] The resulting coffee {{has been described as}} smoother and richer in flavor.Before Jack's opened the search was on to find the perfect coffee roast and the best brewing method. For early inspiration, Jack would head back and forth from his apartment to Puerto Rico Coffee Importers as he tried to nail down the perfect cup of coffee. His method of brewing was the French Press. As Jack ground the coffee and added water, he would stir the grinds to make sure he got an even balanced brew. That was the moment it hit, he remembered his Italian grandmother, who mixed together all the ingredients of her tomato sauce with a <b>steady</b> <b>arm,</b> and he said [...] "We have to Stir the Coffee!" [...] With the idea of stirring to provide full extraction of flavor, a ton of passion and the help of Jack's father's friend, a world class engineer, {{two and a half years}} later the Stir Brewer was awarded a patent and was already in use at the first Jack's Location on 10th St in NYC.|$|E
60|$|Less {{than two}} minutes later, Sir Marmaduke reappeared in the doorway.

60|$|Claire shivered, then, and the {{strength}} seemed to go from the <b>steady</b> <b>arms</b> that had supported Dlorus's head. Dusk had sneaked up on them; the clearing was full of swimming grayness, and between the woman's screams, the woods crackled. Each time Dlorus spoke, her screech was like that of an animal in the woods, and round about them crept such sinister echoes that Milt kept wanting to look back over his shoulder.|$|R
