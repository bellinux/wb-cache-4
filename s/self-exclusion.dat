2500|$|The Roman Catholic Church defines Hell as [...] "a {{state of}} {{definitive}} <b>self-exclusion</b> from communion with God and the blessed." [...] One finds oneself in Hell {{as the result}} of dying in mortal sin without repenting and accepting God's merciful love, becoming eternally separated from Him by one's own free choice immediately after death. In the Roman Catholic Church, many other Christian churches, such as the Baptists and Episcopalians, and some Greek Orthodox churches, Hell is taught as the final destiny of those who have not been found worthy after the general resurrection and last judgment, where they will be eternally punished for sin and permanently separated from God. The nature of this judgment is inconsistent with many Protestant churches teaching the saving comes from accepting Jesus Christ as their savior, while the Greek Orthodox and Catholic Churches teach that the judgment hinges on both faith and works. However, many Liberal Christians throughout Liberal Protestant and Anglican churches believe in universal reconciliation (see below) even though it might contradict more evangelical views in their denomination.|$|E

Neither the austerities and mortifications to which their lives are devoted, nor their rigid and terrible <b>self-exclusion</b> from all intercourse with their fellow-beings in the world around them, have diminished their sympathy for affliction, or their readiness in ministering to the wants of the poor. Any assistance of any kind that they can render, is always at the service of those who require it, without distinction of rank or religion.

3000|$|Furthermore, {{young people}} in post-conflict {{settings}} arrive in school with profound exposure to social cruelties (UNICEF 1996) some exhibiting troubled and troublesome behaviour (Boyden and Rider 1996) for having participated in violence for survival, or forcefully recruited by militias equipping them with “power of the gun” (Sommers 2009 : 35). Similarly, when society allows those who commit violations against human rights {{get away with it}} due to a culture of impunity (HRW 2013), the violence culture is potentially reinforced amongst young people (UNICEF-Kenya 2009) resulting in strained teacher–pupil relationships as reported in Kenyan schools (Datoo and Johnson 2013). Besides PEV-related violence, implementation of corporal punishment policy in Kenyan schools is still problematic (Mweru 2010). Accordingly, it provides ‘easy’ means to managing troublesome behaviour. As Davies (2004) posits, repeated experiences of violence in and outside school can result in children perceiving ‘threat’ as daily danger. This situation can stimulate self-protection habits for some children e.g. <b>self-exclusions,</b> thus avoiding intimidating places like schools (Salmi 2006). Yet, an understanding and response to children’s needs and behaviour difficulties in post-conflict schooling is fundamental in not only combating reproduction of conflict and victimisation (Davies 2004) but also promoting children’s continued access, participation and achievement in education. This review of literature leads to my research question: “How did conflict-affected children perceive their own learning and development needs in relation to their inclusion in education after post-election violence in Kenya, and how were these needs addressed through their interactions with their teachers?” [...]...|$|R
60|$|But while opinion {{concerning}} him {{had remained}} nearly stationary, and his daily habits had presented scarcely any visible change, Marner's inward {{life had been}} a history and a metamorphosis, as that of every fervid nature must be when it has fled, or been condemned, to solitude. His life, before he came to Raveloe, had been filled with the movement, the mental activity, and the close fellowship, which, in that day as in this, marked {{the life of an}} artisan early incorporated in a narrow religious sect, where the poorest layman has the chance of distinguishing himself by gifts of speech, and has, at the very least, the weight of a silent voter in the government of his community. Marner was highly thought of in that little hidden world, known to itself as the church assembling in Lantern Yard; he was believed to be a young man of exemplary life and ardent faith; and a peculiar interest had been centred in him ever since he had fallen, at a prayer-meeting, into a mysterious rigidity and suspension of consciousness, which, lasting for an hour or more, had been mistaken for death. To have sought a medical explanation for this phenomenon would have been held by Silas himself, as well as by his minister and fellow-members, a wilful <b>self-exclusion</b> from the spiritual significance that might lie therein. Silas was evidently a brother selected for a peculiar discipline; and though the effort to interpret this discipline was discouraged by the absence, on his part, of any spiritual vision during his outward trance, yet it was believed by himself and others that its effect was seen in an accession of light and fervour. A less truthful man than he might have been tempted into the subsequent creation of a vision in the form of resurgent memory; a less sane man might have believed in such a creation; but Silas was both sane and honest, though, as with many honest and fervent men, culture had not defined any channels for his sense of mystery, and so it spread itself over the proper pathway of inquiry and knowledge. He had inherited from his mother some acquaintance with medicinal herbs and their preparation--a little store of wisdom which she had imparted to him as a solemn bequest--but of late years he had had doubts about the lawfulness of applying this knowledge, believing that herbs could have no efficacy without prayer, and that prayer might suffice without herbs; so that the inherited delight he had in wandering in the fields in search of foxglove and dandelion and coltsfoot, began to wear to him the character of a temptation.|$|E

These somewhat similar experiences or cultural memories are what he defines as [...] "family resemblance" [...] to explain intercultural relations. In this case, West L.A. punk was primarily composed of children of elites who deviated from their status quo, privileged positions and undertook a process of self-marginalization and isolation resulting from their growing discontent of mainstream society. Experience of <b>self-exclusion</b> and isolation represented itself in the music produced by West L.A. punks whereas music produced in the Eastern half of Los Angeles similarly echoed experiences and memories of anger and discontent towards the isolation and marginalization that dominant society imposed onto them.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Despite {{the great}} {{advances}} in serological testing for transfusion-transmitted infections, {{the selection of}} blood donors by blood bank operators remains {{the only way to}} avoid transmission within the testing window period. Part of this selection is the <b>self-exclusion</b> form, on which the donors can exclude their blood from donation without any explanation. This study assessed the clinical and epidemiological characteristics related to positivity for viral hepatitis and {{to the use of the}} confidential <b>self-exclusion</b> (CSE) form. Methods This transversal study analyzed the data collected from blood donors' files in a hospital in Southern Brazil. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified the clinical and epidemiological variables related to positive serologies of viral hepatitis and to whether the donor was self-excluded. Results Of the 3, 180 donors included in this study, 0. 1 % tested positive for HBsAg, 2. 1 % for anti-HBc, and 0. 9 % for anti-HCV. When the 93 donors with positive serologies for viral hepatitis were compared with those who were negative, a greater proportion of the positive serology group was found to have had a history of blood transfusions (OR= 4. 908; 95 %CI= 1. 628 - 14. 799; p< 0. 01), had repeatedly donated (OR= 2. 147; 95 %CI= 1. 236 - 3. 729; p< 0. 01), and used the CSE form for <b>self-exclusion</b> (OR= 7. 139; 95 %CI= 2. 045 - 24. 923; p< 0. 01).
