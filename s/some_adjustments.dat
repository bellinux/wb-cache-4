5|$|The 1859 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured seven hurricanes, the most recorded during an Atlantic {{hurricane season}} until 1870. However, {{in the absence}} of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated. Of the eight known 1859 cyclones, five were first documented in 1995 by Jose Fernandez-Partagás and Henry Diaz, which was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), with <b>some</b> <b>adjustments.</b> HURDAT is the official source for hurricane data such as track and intensity, although due to sparse records, listings on some storms are incomplete.|$|E
5|$|The 1863 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured five landfalling tropical cyclones. In {{the absence of}} modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated. There were seven recorded hurricanes and no major hurricanes, which are Category3 or higher on the modern day Saffir–Simpson scale. Of the known 1863 cyclones, seven were first documented in 1995 by José Fernández-Partagás and Henry Diaz, while the ninth tropical storm was first documented in 2003. These changes were largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), with <b>some</b> <b>adjustments.</b>|$|E

He also had the experience of working with all the elements as a continuous production system. During construction, Slater made <b>some</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the designs to fit local needs.

25|$|The Shamrock IV and Erin {{proceeded}} to New York, {{from where the}} Erin returned to Britain while Shamrock IV was laid up in the Erie Basin dry dock until 1920, when she received <b>some</b> <b>adjustments</b> to her build and ballast, just before the races were held. Despite Shamrock IVs severe rating, she took the first two races from the defender Resolute, and came closer to winning back the Cup than any previous challenger. The Resolute won every subsequent race of the event.|$|E
25|$|As planned at the outset, {{enrollment}} steadily {{increased in}} following years; the second class comprised 24 students, which rose to 52 by 1991—the year SAMS graduates would {{be tested in}} Operation Desert Storm. The school saw {{a number of other}} changes as well in the early years. Due to challenges with the Army Personnel Management Division in supplying high-quality officers to serve as instructors for three years, Wass de Czege made <b>some</b> <b>adjustments.</b> In 1984, he hired the first two civilian faculty members, both with PhDs in history.|$|E

25|$|Also in the 1990s, Kmart opened four {{stores in}} Mexico, in {{partnership}} with the Mexican retailer Liverpool. All were supercenters, and the locations were all suburbs of Mexico City. About half of the store area was devoted to groceries, and this part of the stores resembled those in the US with <b>some</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the local market. These plus an unfinished store were sold in 1997 to the Mexican hypermarket chain Mega (part of Comercial Mexicana) and remain open under that name, except the store in Tlalnepantla, which was demolished in 2004 to build a Costco.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} {{of the end of the}} war in Europe, Juin was in the United States, where he {{represented}} France at the San Francisco Conference. In the immediate post-war period he continued with his task of rebuilding France's armed forces. This was made difficult by the ending of American Lend-Lease aid, and the military commitments to the Allied occupation of Germany, and in North Africa, Syria and Italy, where the 1947 Paris Peace Treaties made <b>some</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the border. The major looming crisis, though, was the Indochina War. Juin lost his direct access to the President when de Gaulle left office in 1946, and his plans for an Army large enough to handle France's commitments had to be scaled back.|$|E

25|$|On 29 November 1947, the UN General Assembly, voting 33 to 13, with 10 abstentions, {{adopted a}} {{resolution}} recommending the adoption {{and implementation of}} the Plan of Partition with Economic Union as Resolution 181 (II)., while making <b>some</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the boundaries between the two states proposed by it. The division was to take effect on the date of British withdrawal. The partition plan required that the proposed states grant full civil rights to all people within their borders, regardless of race, religion or gender. It {{is important to note that}} the UN General Assembly is only granted the power to make recommendations, therefore, UNGAR 181 was not legally binding. Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union supported the resolution. Haiti, Liberia, and the Philippines changed their votes at the last moment after concerted pressure from the U.S. and from Zionist organisations. The five members of the Arab League, who were voting members at the time, voted against the Plan.|$|E
25|$|This royal {{residence}} {{has been}} in the same location by Norrström {{in the northern part of}} Gamla stan in Stockholm since the middle of the 13th century when the Tre Kronor Castle was built. In modern times the name relates to the building called Kungliga Slottet. The palace was designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and erected on the same place as the medieval Tre Kronor Castle which was destroyed in a fire on 7May 1697. Due to the costly Great Northern War which started in 1700, construction of the palace was halted in 1709, and not recommenced until 1727— six years after the war. When Tessin the Younger died in 1728, the palace was completed by Carl Hårleman who also designed a large part of its Rococo interior. The palace was not ready to use until 1754, when King Adolf Frederick and Queen Louisa Ulrika moved in, but some interior work proceeded until the 1770s. No major conversions have been done in the palace since its completion, only <b>some</b> <b>adjustments,</b> new interiors, modernization and redecorating for different regents and their families, coloration of the facades and addition of the palace museums.|$|E
500|$|In 1920, the Commission built three {{experimental}} cemeteries at Le Treport, Forceville and Louvencourt, {{following the}} principles {{outlined in the}} Kenyon report. Of these, the Forceville Communal Cemetery and Extension was agreed {{to be the most}} successful. Having consulted with garden designer Gertrude Jekyll, the architects created a walled cemetery with uniform headstones in a garden setting, augmented by Blomfield's Cross of Sacrifice and Lutyens' Stone of Remembrance. After <b>some</b> <b>adjustments,</b> Forceville became the template for the Commission's building programme. Cost overruns at all three experimental cemeteries necessitated <b>some</b> <b>adjustments.</b> To ensure future cemeteries remained within their budget the Commission decided to not build shelters in cemeteries that contained less than 200graves, to not place a Stone of Remembrance in any cemetery with less than 400graves, and to limit the height of cemetery walls to [...]|$|E

500|$|Six {{years after}} the Treaty of Paris, the Treaties of Rome were signed by the six ECSC members, {{creating}} the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom). These Communities were based, with <b>some</b> <b>adjustments,</b> on the ECSC. The Treaties of Rome were {{to be in force}} indefinitely, unlike the Treaty of Paris, which was to expire after fifty years. These two new Communities worked on the creation of a customs union and nuclear power community respectively. The Rome treaties were hurried through just before de Gaulle was given emergency powers and proclaimed the Fifth Republic. Despite his efforts to [...] "chloroform" [...] the Communities, their fields rapidly expanded and the EEC became the most important tool for political unification, overshadowing the ECSC.|$|E
500|$|Auditioning actors with no {{theatrical}} experience {{were required}} to prove they could sing and dance as well as act. Mays auditioned with the song [...] "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" [...] from The Rocky Horror Show, while Monteith initially submitted a tape of himself acting only, and was requested to submit a second, musical tape, in which he sang [...] "a cheesy, '80s music-video-style version" [...] of REO Speedwagon's [...] "Can't Fight This Feeling"." [...] Monteith has deemed his casting [...] "spot on" [...] as: [...] "I'm just like my character. I've never trained or had any lessons. I can just do it – with <b>some</b> <b>adjustments,</b> obviously." [...] McHale came from a boy-band background, having previously {{been part of the}} group Not Like Them. He auditioned with the song [...] "Let It Be" [...] and tested alongside Colfer and Ushkowitz. He explained that the diversity of the cast's backgrounds reflects the range of different musical styles within the show itself: [...] "It's a mix of everything: classic rock, current stuff, R Even the musical theater stuff is switched up. You won't always recognize it." [...] Lynch was originally intended to be a guest star, but became a series regular when a Damon Wayans pilot she was working on for ABC fell through.|$|E
500|$|The English {{localization}} of Uprising {{was handled}} by Nintendo of America's Nintendo Treehouse localization department. Sakurai gave the localization team [...] "a lot of leeway" [...] for {{this part of}} development. Much of the original script's humor stemmed from the usage of Japanese conversational nuances, which would not have translated properly into English. Because of this, adjustments needed to be made {{so that it was}} enjoyable for English speakers. The video game references were taken almost directly from the Japanese script, with <b>some</b> <b>adjustments</b> so they resonated with the Western market. As with other localizations, the team avoided topical references so the scripts would take on a timeless feel. The casting and recording director was Ginny McSwain. Two prominent English cast members were Antony Del Rio, who voices Pit and Dark Pit, and Ali Hillis, who voices Palutena. The majority of the voice recording was done separately, but half the dialogue between Pit and Palutena was recorded by the two actors together before scheduling conflicts forced them to record their lines separately, responding to either voice clips of the other actors or the director reading lines. The European version only included the English dub, as there was no room on the 3DS cartridge to include multiple voice tracks.|$|E

500|$|Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep {{was also}} {{released}} {{with a limited}} edition PSP-3000 as a bundle in Japan featuring designs from the Kingdom Hearts series on its back. On March 16, 2010, Square Enix announced the English version of the game, which was released on September 7, 2010 in North America, and on September 10, 2010 in Europe. The English version of the game contains <b>some</b> <b>adjustments</b> from the original version, such as a new difficulty setting called Critical Mode, and additional songs for the Ice Cream Beat minigame. A new boss known only as the Unknown appears in the overseas versions, {{as well as a}} new gameplay element called [...] "Crown Stickers", which act {{much the same way as}} the Puzzle Pieces from Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix. The game also has a notable voice-acting cast of returning members such as Jesse McCartney and James Woods, as well as numerous new actors such as Willa Holland, Jason Dohring, Leonard Nimoy, and Mark Hamill. An Ultimania guidebook of the game was released on March 25, 2010. Like previous games, a light novel of Birth by Sleep has been written by Tomoko Kanemaki and illustrated by Shiro Amano.
