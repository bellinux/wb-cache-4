40|$|Consider {{the task}} of {{sampling}} and reconstructing a bandlimited spatial field in ^ 2 using moving sensors that take measurements along their path. It is inexpensive to increase the sampling rate along the paths of the sensors but more expensive to increase the total distance traveled by the sensors per unit area, which we call the path density. In this paper we introduce the problem of designing sensor trajectories that are minimal in path density subject to the condition that the measurements of the field on these trajectories admit perfect reconstruction of bandlimited fields. We study various possible designs of sampling trajectories. Generalizing some ideas from the classical theory of sampling on lattices, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on the trajectories for perfect reconstruction. We show that a single set of equispaced parallel lines has the lowest path density from certain restricted classes of trajectories that admit perfect reconstruction. We then generalize some of our results to higher dimensions. We first obtain results on designing sampling trajectories in higher dimensional fields. Further, interpreting trajectories as 1 -dimensional manifolds, we extend some of our ideas to higher dimensional <b>sampling</b> <b>manifolds.</b> We formulate the problem of designing κ-dimensional <b>sampling</b> <b>manifolds</b> for d-dimensional spatial fields that are minimal in manifold density, a natural generalization of the path density.

40|$|Recently, various {{applications}} have {{motivated the}} study of spectral structures (eigenvalues and eigenfunctions) of the so-called Laplace-Beltrami operator of a manifold and their discrete versions. A popular choice for the discrete version is the so-called Gaussian weighted graph Laplacian which {{can be applied to}} point cloud data that <b>samples</b> a <b>manifold.</b> Naturally, the question of stability of the spectrum of this discrete Laplacian under the perturbation of the <b>sampled</b> <b>manifold</b> becomes important for its practical usage. Previous results showed that the spectra of both the manifold Laplacian and discrete Laplacian are stable when the perturbation is “nice ” {{in the sense that it}} is restricted to a diffeomorphism with minor area distortion. However, this forbids, for example, small topological changes. We study the stability of the spectrum of the weighted graph Laplacian under more general perturbations. In particular, we allow arbitrary, including topological, changes to the hidden manifold as long as they are localized in the ambient space and the area distortion is small. Manifold Laplacians may change dramatically in this case. Nevertheless, we show that the weighted graph Laplacians computed from two sets of points, uniformly randomly <b>sampled</b> from a <b>manifold</b> and a perturbed version of it, have similar spectra. The distance between the two spectra can be bounded in terms of the size of the perturbation and some intrinsic properties of the original manifold. ...|$|R

An important feature of manifold hopping is that significant data reduction can be achieved without sacrificing output visual fidelity, by carefully adjusting the hopping intervals. A novel view along the manifold is rendered by locally warping a single manifold mosaic using a constant depth assumption, without the need for accurate depth or feature correspondence.

Continuous measurements were obtained at six locations using an automated chamber system between April and December, 2000. Fluxes were measured every half hour by circulating chamber headspace air through a <b>sampling</b> <b>manifold</b> assembly and a closed-path infrared gas analyzer. Maximum CO 2 fluxes measured varied by a factor of almost 3 between the chamber locations, while the highest daily average fluxes observed at two chamber locations occasionally reached values near 15 mol C m− 2 s− 1. Generally, fluxes ranged between 2 and 10 mol C m− 2 s− 1 during the measurement period. CO 2 flux from the forest floor was strongly related to soil temperature with the highest correlation found with 5 cm depth temperature. A simple temperature dependent exponential model fit to the nighttime fluxes revealed Q 10 values in the normal range of 2 – 3 during the warmer parts of the year, but values of 4 – 5 during cooler periods. Moss photosynthesis was negligible in four of the six chambers, while at the other locations, it reduced daytime half-hourly net CO 2 flux by about 25 %. Soil moisture had very little effect on forest floor CO 2 flux. Hysteresis in the annual relationship between chamber fluxes and soil temperatures was observed. Net exchange from the six chambers was estimated to be 1920 ± 530 g C m− 2 per year, the higher estimates exceeding measurement of ecosystem respiration using year-round eddy correlation above the canopy at this site.

A common strategy {{to overcome this}} problem is to perform dimensionality reduction on selected landmarks and to successively embed the entire dataset with the Nyström method. The two main challenges that arise are: (i) the landmarks selected in non-Euclidean geometries must result in a low reconstruction error, (ii) the graph constructed from sparsely sampled landmarks must approximate the manifold well. We propose to sample the landmarks from determinantal distributions on non-Euclidean spaces. Since current determinantal sampling algorithms have the same complexity as those for manifold learning, we present an efficient approximation with linear complexity. Further, we recover the local geometry after the sparsification by assigning each landmark a local covariance matrix, estimated from the original point set.

The δ additional dimensions may be required when the RS model is embedded into a more fundamental theory. We analyze two classes of δ−dimensional manifolds: flat and curved geometries. In the first case, the additional flat dimensions may accommodate localized fermions which in turn could resolve issues, such as proton decay and flavor, that were not addressed in the original RS proposal. In the latter case, the positive curvature of an Sδ manifold with δ> 1 can geometrically provide the 5 -dimensional warping of the RS model.
