50|$|One {{turn of the}} cock {{controlling}} the couplings divided the train into segments of separate cars, each of which had a brake which acted automatically upon detachment from the train. This partially destroyed {{the momentum of the}} whole, and a collision could only take place by a succession of comparatively light blows from the engine and slowing sections of the train, instead of by a single blow with the momentum of the whole train. The brakes were operated upon the balancing wheels of the trucks, but they mayed also be fitted upon the <b>supporting</b> <b>wheels.</b> The action of the brakes could be well illustrated by rails between the rolls of a rolling mill, except that the action was reversed. It was apparent that no slipping of the wheels can take place, no matter what pressure may be brought to bear upon them.|$|E

50|$|The {{truck was}} a {{development}} of the conditions controlling {{the adoption of the}} permanent way. It consisted of a horizontal rectangular wrought iron frame, stiffened by cast iron pieces and provided with stiff pedestals bolted to its under side, in which was a fixed short axle for the wheels. Each truck had four wheels set at an angle of about 45 degrees, the axles being properly inclined. Between the <b>supporting</b> <b>wheels</b> were two horizontal wheels, one {{on each side of the}} upper girder, upon vertical axles attached to the frame. These wheels bear upon the rails of the upper truck beam, and were kept in yielding contact with the rails by springs outside the boxes, and served as balancing wheels to take the side oscillations of the cars. They were formed with flanges that passed under the lower edges of the rails, thus tying the truck to the rails, so that no lifting or jumping could take place, and there was no possibility of the trucks running off the track. The wheels were 42 inches in diameter, had a tread of 3½ inches, and rotated independently of each other. In case any or all of the wheels should break, provision was made to prevent the cars from overturning or leaving the track, by means of a strong shoe, which would slide upon but could not leave the way. On top of the truck frame was a movable iron frame carrying four posts containing heavy spiral springs. These posts interlock with similar spring sockets bolted to the framing of the floor of the car, which was directly above the truck and within 18 inches of the top of the girder. The truck was guided in turning by a center pin, and was securely tied to the car body, as the horizontal flanges of its frame castings overlap the rim of the upper turntable. In passing curves and switches, the trucks turned upon the balancing wheels, placed centrally between the <b>supporting</b> <b>wheels,</b> which were 4 feet apart.|$|E
50|$|As is {{usual in}} engineering, {{there were a}} number of {{trade-offs}} to be made in steam locomotive design. There is a limit to the rate that steam can be delivered to the pistons, therefore higher speed was obtained with larger driving wheels. These however, limited the size of the boiler, since it needed to fit between them, particularly with the preoccupation of the time with a lower centre of gravity. The tendency had been to lengthen the boilers with <b>supporting</b> <b>wheels</b> front and rear. Thus, passenger engines like the so-called Long Boiler locomotives were usually of a 4-2-0 wheel arrangement. However too long a boiler also created instability. Some locomotives improved adhesion for heavier loads by coupling pairs of driving wheels, however there was a tendency for the wrought iron coupling rods to break especially at speed. Thus four and six-coupled locomotives were used for freight trains.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Wheels are an {{important}} component of a motorcycle. Tires is a ring shaped component that covers the wheels rim to protect it and enable better vehicle performance. Maintaining them is very important. Tires of the motorcycle often get punctured, and we are left with some problems. To tackle these problems we {{have come up with a}} mechanism. In this mechanism we have provided additional wheels of comparatively smaller diameter and thickness. Whenever a tire punctures we are left with a flat tire, so in this situation our mechanism comes in effect. The motorcycle is put on a main stand with some clearance on the front end of the wheel. The two additional wheels come on the ground and support the vehicle in front. Now the front punctured tyre is above the ground. To move the vehicle power is supplied from the rear wheel thus driving the front <b>supporting</b> <b>wheels...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{stability}} of axially moving beam-like materials (e. g., belts, bands, paper and webs) which translate at speeds near to and above the so-called "critical speed stability limit. " In the companion paper, a theoretical model for an axially moving beam was presented which accounted for geometrically non-linear beam deflections and the initial beam curvature generated by <b>supporting</b> <b>wheels</b> and pulleys. In that paper, analysis of steady response revealed that the beam possesses multiple, non-trivial equilibrium states when translating at supercritical speeds. The equations of motion are presently linearized about these equilibria and their stability is predicted from the eigenvalue problem for free response. Asymptotic and numerical solutions to the eigenvalue problem are presented for the respective cases of small and arbitrary equilibrium curvature. The solutions illustrate that the translating beam has multiple stable equilibrium states in the supercritical speed regime. The solutions confirm that the critical speed behavior for axially moving materials is extremely sensitive to system imperfections, such as initial curvature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Composite (multiple) {{bead wire}} is an {{important}} machine for stone-sheet production with efficiency, but it takes up space, with big energy consumption, uneven thickness, and noise. The current study aims at optimal designing a bead saw with energy-, material- saving, and being light in weight under the constraint of the strength, stiffness and stability for the frame. A 140 rope saw, as a prototype {{and one of the}} applications, discussion of two main frames were done with the layouts consisting of the driving wheel, guide wheel, and the <b>supporting</b> <b>wheels</b> from a variety of structural Patterns. By comparison between the triangular and rectangular layouts, a conclusion was drawn that under the condition of all other things being equal, rectangular layout is more reasonable; each wire is supposed to be adjusted for the uniformity of tension of the whole wires. The objective function was taken as the sum of the mass expression of each component of the frame with a series of punishing factors. The hollow structure of double columns with guide grooves and special beams were got, achieving design goals...|$|E

40|$|Early in the 1980 's Jens G. Balchen {{wanted to}} create an {{autonomous}} bike, capable of driving without any help from <b>supporting</b> <b>wheels</b> or human interaction. The intriguing idea included a variety of complicated concepts and {{was at that time}} almost an impossible task to accomplish. As time progressed and both technology and equipment developed, the possibility of a driverless bike becomes more than just an idea. The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) has during the later years dedicated resources, time and effort in making a reality of the concept through the project named CyberBike. Every year, clever solutions are brought to the table, adding more functionality and better designs, bringing the project closer to a complete solution of an autonomous bike. The main focus of this thesis has been to develop a system for the bikes positioning system, as well as collision avoidance. It also includes the communication made from the bike to a potential operator via wireless data transfer. The goal is to make a solution for the bike so that it could travel a given route, while communicating important data back to the observers. The task encompasses gathering the information made available by previous work, defining key areas of improvement and designing and testing a proposed solution. First, the overall design is presented, showing how the two circuit boards made as the solution are connected with possible peripherals. The technical communication challenges pertaining the wireless communication is touched upon and relevant concepts are introduced. Furthermore, the selected microcontroller for the system is presented, giving key pointers in specific areas which might be confusing. Different possible devices are then discussed for the positioning system, the wireless communication and different setups of range sensors. Testing done using the equipment explained in the thesis is presented, showing the results of the system. Improvements to the solution are introduced based on the experience obtained through the work, giving a solid basis for further work relating to the subject. </p...|$|E

40|$|O estudo das tensões em colhedoras de forragens é imprescindível, uma vez que as condições de operação são muito variáveis e severas. Utilizou-se um sistema "datalogger" devidamente calibrado para medir as tensões, em função do tempo, numa colhedora de forragem. Foram desenvolvidos modelos matemáticos para obter a variação periódica dessas tensões, considerando-se a influência da roda de apoio e da velocidade angular do rotor de corte. O ajuste dos modelos foi verificado pelo coeficiente de determinação (R²). A variação periódica das tensões, em função do tempo, para os valores experimentais e teóricos, foi representada graficamente, utilizando-se da planilha eletrônica EXCEL. Observou-se que as menores amplitudes de tensões e os maiores períodos do ciclo corresponderam aos tratamentos que utilizaram a roda de apoio. A análise estatística mostrou que a velocidade angular do rotor de corte apresentou diferença significativa, {{conforme}} o Teste de Tukey, para 5 %. Com base nos resultados obtidos, concluiu-se que os ciclos de tensões em colhedoras de forragens podem ser representados com bom ajuste por funções senoidais e que o uso da roda de apoio pode aumentar o tempo de serviço da colhedora.
