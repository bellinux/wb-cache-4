5|$|JFK was {{released}} in theaters on December 20, 1991. In its first week of release, JFK tied with Beauty and the Beast for fifth place in the U.S. box office and its critics began to <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> flop. Warner Brothers executives argued that this was at least partly because the film's long running time meant it had had fewer screenings than other films. Box office picked up momentum, however, {{in part due to}} a $15 million marketing campaign from the studio. By the first week in January 1992, it had grossed over $50 million worldwide, eventually earning over $200 million worldwide and $70 million in the United States during its initial run.|$|E

He had, in turn, been thinking about leaving, so you could <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> mutual decision. There's no bad blood, just a relationship that came to an end, and that's that." ...|$|E
500|$|James Caldwell of the Pro Wrestling Torch {{published}} {{a review of}} the show. In his review he stated that the main event was an [...] "amazing, special match", which he felt was [...] "pro wrestling at its finest in 2005." [...] As for the Raven's Rules match, Caldwell thought it was a [...] "brutal hardcore match", which was a [...] "good adrenaline rush but nothing separated the match from previous TNA hardcore matches." [...] Regarding the NWA World Tag Team Championship bout, Caldwell <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "decent tag match that could have been much better if Waltman and Shelley were around at the end where the formula could have been changed up." ...|$|E

Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico {{one of my favorite}} places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There was a moment where I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. I was looking at the take at 5 in the morning, [...] ready to kill me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me.|$|E
500|$|James Caldwell, {{also of the}} Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, {{reviewed}} the show. He felt differently from both Keller and Kapur, as he stated that Bound for Glory overall was a [...] "bad PPV." [...] He believed the main event was a [...] "cluster," [...] the Gauntlet match was [...] "pointless," [...] and the Monster's Ball match was the [...] "same ole' carwreck match with no long-term selling and too many highspots that didn't mean much {{at the end of}} the day." [...] He called the NWA World Tag Team Championship match [...] "ridiculous" [...] and the TNA X Division Champion number-one contender the [...] "worst Ultimate X match in TNA history." [...] He did, however, praise the Iron Man match stating it was [...] "definitely the match of the night with some good wrestling holds and believable nearfalls." [...] He also enjoyed the Liger versus Joe bout, <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "good start to the show even if it was shorter than expected." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Juicy" [...] was {{released}} {{as the lead}} single on August 8, 1994. It peaked at number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 14 on Hot R/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and reached number 3 on the Hot Rap Singles. It shipped 500,000 copies in the United States and the RIAA certified it Gold on November 16, 1994. Produced by Combs, it features a prominent sample of [...] "Juicy Fruit" [...] as performed by James Mtume. AllMusic's Steve Huey stated that, {{along with the other}} singles, it was an [...] "upbeat, commercial moment", calling it a [...] "rags-to-riches chronicle". Andrew Kameka, of HipHopDX.com, stated that the song was one of his [...] "greatest and most-revealing songs" [...] and went on to <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Part-autobiography, part-declaration-of-success.

500|$|On 7 May, Benfica {{played their}} final match {{of the season}} at Estádio da Mata Real. Benfica's Manuel Fernandes scored first but could not prevent Paços de Ferreira scoring three second-half goals, thus losing the game. Benfica ended the season in third place, missing out on the title and an {{automatic}} place in the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League. Despite winning both games against Porto, the closest Benfica had come from them was on the 18 and 19 match-days, with only three points. Benfica closed the season 12 points behind the leader and five from Sporting. Of the Big Three, Benfica conceded the most goals (29) and scored the second-highest number of goals (51), with the worst goal-average (+22). Koeman wanted to fulfil his contract with Benfica, but after negotiations with the management and sudden interest from PSV, Benfica opted to release him on mutual terms. Koeman thanked Luís Filipe Vieira and José Veiga for their support in face of repeated criticism, and said, [...] "This is very big club, but you cannot win all the time, although I admit, that in the Primeira Liga, {{he did not do}} everything he could. We could have done better. But I <b>say,</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pleasure being here, now my career will continue elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{review of}} the Birthday of the World volume in Booklist Review commented that it offered a [...] "change of pace" [...] {{from the rest of}} the collection, and that in {{contrast}} to many of the other stories, which are set in the Hainish Universe, it [...] "stood well on its own". Suzy Hansen, writing in Salon, said that the novella allowed the reader to imagine the process of designing a part of the world. Hansen went on to say that [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] allowed [...] "reality architects" [...] to ponder questions such as how to form language, and what environmental constraints shaped human beings. Hansen described the relationship between Hsing and Luis as a [...] "wonderful love story", and also praised the characterization of Bliss as a [...] "remarkable twist on organized religion", saying that the [...] "conflict [...] logical sense". Writing in 2015, Haiven called [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] a [...] "telling narrative" [...] and described it as a [...] "grim and timely warning" [...] about religious fundamentalism, and its power to shape society. He compared the struggle of the protagonists to that of the anarchist society of The Dispossessed, and went on to <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "a chastening lesson in both the potential and the perils of freedom, [...] the secret life of authority".|$|E
500|$|Other {{issues of}} {{contention}} include {{the lack of}} historical context; the film does not cover some of the {{events leading up to}} Chávez's ousting, including the long-running political crisis and the general strike. Gunson also criticizes the filmmakers for showing events out of order. In June 2002, they filmed an opposition community group as its members considered [...] "how to defend themselves against possible... attacks" [...] from Chávez's supporters. In the film, this sequence is placed before the march. Bartley justified the action, saying that the residents' opinions were representative of those held [...] "long before" [...] the events of April 2002. Responding to the critique, the BBC added a date stamp to the sequence for the film's repeat broadcast. Gunson also cites footage of Caracas mayor Freddy Bernal as he sings to a happy group of Chávez supporters in front of the palace. Later images of a [...] "differently dressed Bernal" [...] reveal that the footage was from another day. Similarly, Gunson says that until shot at, [...] "The opposition march was entirely peaceful." [...] The film presents footage of its [...] "violent finale"—including an image from another day—as if it occurred during the protest's approach to the palace, accompanied by the narrated claim that [...] "some in the vanguard looked ready for a fight". Bartley and ÓBriain admit that they included a [...] "limited" [...] amount of archive footage, but <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "legitimate reconstruction" [...] to build context [...] "before the core narrative of the coup [...] off" [...] as they [...] "could not be everywhere filming at all times".|$|E
