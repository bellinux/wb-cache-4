Nothing but political [...] argument, and again political argument, even at table, where he [...] managed to hunt me out. At dinner, when I so gladly forget all the [...] vexations of the world, he spoiled the best dishes for me by his [...] patriotic gall, which he poured as a bitter <b>sauce</b> <b>over</b> everything. [...] Calf’s feet, à la maître d’hôtel, then my innocent bonne bouche, [...] he completely spoiled for me by Job’s tidings from Germany, which he [...] scraped together out of the most unreliable newspapers. And then his [...] accursed remarks, which spoiled one’s appetite! [...] . This was a sort [...] of table-talk which did not greatly exhilarate me, and I avenged [...] myself by affecting an excessive, almost impassioned indifference for [...] the object of Börne’s enthusiasm. For example, Börne was indignant [...] that immediately on my arrival in Paris I had nothing better to do [...] than to write for German papers a long account of the Exhibition of [...] Pictures. I omit all discussion as to whether that interest in Art [...] which induced me to undertake this work was so utterly irreconcilable [...] with the revolutionary interests of the day; but Börne saw in it a [...] proof of my indifference toward the sacred cause of humanity, and I [...] could in my turn spoil the taste of his patriotic sauerkraut for [...] him by talking all dinner-time of nothing but pictures, of Robert’s [...] ‘Reapers,’ Horace Vernet’s ‘Judith,’ and Scheffer’s ‘Faust.’ [...] That I never thought it worth while to discuss my political [...] principles with him it is needless to say; and once when he declared [...] that he had found a contradiction in my writings, I satisfied myself [...] with the ironical answer, ‘You are mistaken, mon cher; such [...] contradictions never occur in my works, for always before I begin to [...] write, I read over the statement of my political principles in my [...] previous writings, that I may not contradict myself, and that no one [...] may be able to reproach me with apostasy from my liberal [...] principles.’” ...|$|E
