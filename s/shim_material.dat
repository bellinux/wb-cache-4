40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} a microwave interferometer technique which measures the thickness of liquid <b>shim</b> <b>material</b> applied to composite surfaces. Liquid shim, which is a low dielectric material, is applied to spar cap surfaces in order to maintain wing skin mold-line tolerances while reducing stresses at the location of fastener holes. For this application, the thickness of the <b>shim</b> <b>material</b> must be controlled within specified limits. Microwave reflection techniques provide an alternative nondestructive approach to liquid shim thickness measurements...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{hysteretic}} behaviour of Asymmetrical Friction Connection (AFC) assembled with different shim materials such as Aluminium, Brass, Mild Steel, Bisalloy 80, Bisalloy 400, and Bisalloy 500 subjected to a cyclic displacement regime applied with a quasi-static velocity of 10 mm/s and with higher velocities of 190 mm/s. Results show that at the high velocity regardless of the <b>shim</b> <b>material</b> the hysteresis loop is less stable, and greater forces are required to activate the sliding mechanism of the slotted plate {{when compared with the}} hysteresis loop at the low velocity. Boundaries of the effective friction coefficient for the quasi-static and high velocity cases, as well as a model that represents the velocity dependence of AFCs in terms of the effective friction coefficient are presented...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{introduces a}} shaft seal in which leaf seal elements are constructed from slotted <b>shim</b> <b>material</b> formed and layered into a frusto-conical assembly. Limited elastic deflection of seal leaves with increasing system pressure close large startup clearance to a small, non-contacting, steady state running clearance. At shutdown seal elements resiliently retract as differential seal pressure diminishes. Large seal clearance during startup and shutdown provides {{a mechanism for}} rub avoidance. Minimum operating clearance improves performance and non-contacting operation promises long seal life. Design features of this seal, sample calculations at differential pressures up to 2400 psid and benefit comparison with brush and labyrinth seals is documented in paper, AIAA 2005 3985, presented at the Advanced Seal Technology session of the Joint Propulsion Conference in Tucson this past July. In this presentation use of bimetallic leaf material will be discussed. Frictional heating of bimetallic leaf seals during a seal rub can relieve the rub condition to some extent with a change in seal shape. Improved leaf seal rub tolerance is expected with bimetallic material...|$|E

A test rig that is typically used to conduct contact fatigue experiments was used for these tests. Several sizes of drill <b>material,</b> <b>shim</b> stock and pieces of gear teeth were introduced and then driven through the meshing region. The level of torque required to drive the "chip" through the gear mesh was measured. From the data gathered, chip size sufficient to jam the mechanism can be determined...|$|R

A test rig that is typically used to conduct contact fatigue experiments was used for these tests.

The level of torque required to drive the "chip" through the gear mesh was measured. From the data gathered, chip size sufficient to jam the mechanism can be determined. INTRODUCTION In some space mechanisms the loading can be so high that there is some possibility that a gear chip might be liberated while in operation of the mechanism [1 - 5]. Also, due to the closely packed nature of some space mechanisms and the fact that a space grease is used for lubrication, chips that are released can then be introduced to other gear meshes within this mechanism. In this instance, it is desirable to know the consequences of a gear chip entering in between meshing gear teeth. To help provide some understanding, a series of bench-top experiments was conducted to engage chips of simulated and gear material fragments into a meshing gear pair. One purpose of the experiments was to determine the relationship of chip size to the torque required to rotate the gear set through the mesh cycle. The second purpose was to determine the condition of the gear chip material after engagement by the meshing gears, primarily to determine if the chip would break into pieces and to observe the motion of the chip as the engagement was completed. This document also presents preliminary testing done with metal debris other than chips from gears, namely steel shim stock and drill bits of various sizes and diameters...|$|R
