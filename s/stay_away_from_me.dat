40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed January 13, 2011) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 61 - 64) I hail from the beautiful city of Mumbai {{in the western part}} of India. Since 2007, I have been a student of Graphic Design at San Diego State University. Although it sounds ironic, <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home allowed <b>me</b> to understand my country and her people better. Several times, I reflected upon the social issues back in my country and how I could approach them through my work. I realized that the religious intolerance that is so prevalent approach them through my work. I realized that the religious intolerance that is so prevalent in the Indian society bothered me. Considering India is home to several religions and practices. I couldn't justify these religious conflicts, especially between Hindus and Muslims. Hindus form the majority group with eighty percent of the Indian population practicing Hinduism. Muslims are the largest minority group being fourteen percent of the total Indian population. Both these groups share a history of ethnic violence and bloody riots. Hinduism was born in India; whereas, Islam was introduced in the country around the tenth century A. D. by Arab traders on business visits. In spite of living together for more than a thousand years on the same land, the two religious groups still show signs of conflict. India's politicians and their agendas have also contributed to the rise of religious conflicts. These politicians have repeatedly exploited religious and ethnic tensions for short-term political gain. In this process, they have completely ignored the long-term social consequences that have impacted the cordial relations between these two groups. These tensions, resulting in repeated riots, have left permanent scars in the minds of the people of both groups. Through my work, I am attempting to bridge the differences between these two groups and highlight the elements of harmonious relationships that can exist between them. I am addressing this issue by showing the CONTRAST in the stereotypical iconographic images in various categories, such as food, clothing, architecture, literature, beliefs, and symbols between the two groups; and at the same time highlighting the commonality between the two, which is the UNIFYING element in my design. Through my work, I want to emphasize that even though these two groups have had several conflicts and have different faiths and beliefs, the commonality between Hindus and Muslims is far stronger than the differences. During the week of October 17 - 22, 2009, I used the space of the Flor y Canto Gallery at San Diego State University in order to showcase my posters, information panels and mandala installation. Overall, I created an intimate environment in the gallery where the visitor could experience the contrasting nature between the two religious groups and travel through the factors that unify them. Slides of the gallery installation of the project are available for viewing in the Slide Library in the School of Art, Design, and Art History...|$|R
6000|$|He {{gave us a}} {{look out}} of those eyes of his, so like {{the eyes of a}} mild eagle, and said abruptly: [...] "What do you say to this then? [...] . I was out in the dog-days last year with this fellow of mine, looking for Osmunda, and stayed some days in a village--never mind the name. Coming back one evening from my tramp, I saw some boys stoning a mealy-coloured dog. I went up and told the young devils to stop it. They only looked at me in the injured way boys do, and one of them called out, 'It's mad, guv'nor!' I told them to clear off, and they took to their heels. The dog {{followed}} me. It was a young, leggy, mild looking mongrel, cross--I should say--between a brown retriever and an Irish terrier. There was froth about its lips, and its eyes were watery; it looked indeed as if it might be in distemper. I was afraid of infection for this fellow of mine, and whenever it came too close shooed it away, till at last it slunk off altogether. Well, about nine o'clock, when I was settling down to write by the open window of my sitting-room--still daylight, and very quiet and warm--there began that most maddening sound, the barking of an unhappy dog. I could do nothing with that continual 'Yap yap!' going on, and it was too hot to shut the window; so I went out to see if I could stop it. The men were all at the pub, and the women just finished with their gossip; there was no sound at all but the continual barking of this dog, somewhere away out in the fields. I travelled by ear across three meadows, till I came on a hay-stack by a pool of water. There was the dog sure enough--the same mealy-coloured mongrel, tied to a stake, yapping, and making frantic little runs on a bit of rusty chain; whirling round and round the stake, then standing quite still, and shivering. I went up and spoke to it, but it backed into the hay-stack, and there it <b>stayed</b> shrinking <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> with its tongue hanging out. It had been heavily struck by something on the head; the cheek was cut, one eye half-closed, and an ear badly swollen. I tried to get hold of it, but the poor thing was beside itself with fear. It snapped and flew round so that I had to give it up, and sit down with this fellow here beside me, to try and quiet it--a strange dog, you know, will generally form his estimate of you from the way it sees you treat another dog. I had to sit there quite half an hour before it would let me go up to it, pull the stake out, and lead it away. The poor beast, though it was so feeble from the blows it had received, was still half-frantic, and I didn't dare to touch it; and all the time I took good care that this fellow here didn't come too near. Then came the question what was to be done. There was no vet, of course, and I'd no place to put it except my sitting-room, which didn't belong to me. But, looking at its battered head, and its half-mad eyes, I thought: 'No trusting you with these bumpkins; you'll have to come in here for the night!' Well, I got it in, and heaped two or three of those hairy little red rugs landladies are so fond of, up in a corner; and got it on to them, and put down my bread and milk. But it wouldn't eat--its sense of proportion was all gone, fairly destroyed by terror. It lay there moaning, {{and every now and then}} it raised its head with a 'yap' of sheer fright, dreadful to hear, and bit the air, as if its enemies were on it again; and this fellow of mine lay in the opposite corner, with his head on his paw, watching it. I sat up for a long time with that poor beast, sick enough, and wondering how it had come to be stoned and kicked and battered into this state; and next day I made it my business to find out." ...|$|R
