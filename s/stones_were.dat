5|$|In 1965, the Museum Society raised $40,000 {{to mount}} the grand portal of the old church. It was {{installed}} in the de Young Museum, the centerpiece of Hearst Court, the main exhibit hall. The rest of the <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> abandoned by the museum in May 1969 with the announcement {{that there would be}} no reconstruction. After this, <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> occasionally taken by park workers and used to decorate Golden Gate Park.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{some of the}} <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> used to {{construct}} an outdoor reading terrace adjoining the Helen Crocker Russell Library of Horticulture, part of the Strybing Arboretum and Botanical Gardens in Golden Gate Park. Other <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> used for various purposes around Golden Gate Park and the Japanese Tea Garden, taken unofficially by park workers as they saw fit. Some of these {{ended up in the}} park's AIDS Memorial Grove, others on a scent-based flower walkway named Garden of Fragrance.|$|E
5|$|A new weir {{wall was}} {{constructed}} between 1992 and 2000 due to safety concerns {{with the original}} wall. Construction was planned to limit negative affects on scenery and wildlife. To this end, natural <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> used for the exterior and fishways {{were included in the}} design.|$|E
50|$|Tapaan <b>Stone</b> <b>is</b> in Akad Village. The name of Tapaan <b>Stone</b> <b>is</b> {{taken by}} the name of a big <b>stone.</b> Tapaan <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> a big <b>stone</b> that has large {{footprints}} and tourists travel there.|$|R
50|$|The eastern Class I <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> highly eroded and the incised {{symbols are}} {{extremely}} difficult to make out. This <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> thought to be unfinished or a later fake. This <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> known as Aberlemno 5.|$|R
5000|$|A quarry {{was opened}} at Mariveles, Bataan, 30 mi west of Manila across Manila Bay, in which coping <b>stone</b> <b>was</b> cut {{and from which}} about [...] of broken <b>stone</b> <b>was</b> taken. A <b>stone</b> crusher <b>was</b> {{installed}} in Manila at the bridge site and <b>stone</b> <b>was</b> crushed for concrete there.|$|R
5|$|Following excavation, several <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> {{placed in}} the {{original}} sockets {{in order to create}} a reconstruction of the original circle. A fence was then erected around the circle to discourage further interference.|$|E
5|$|In July 2017, it was {{reported}} that the Rolling <b>Stones</b> <b>were</b> getting ready to record their first album of original material in more than a decade.|$|E
5|$|This {{view was}} {{the norm for}} some time after Boece and is {{reflected}} in the Statistical Accounts for Aberlemno. It took until the mid-19th century for it to be pointed out that not only was there no evidence that the <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> Scandinavian in origin, there was also ample evidence that the <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> Pictish/Scottish in origin. The kirkyard stone predates the Battle of Barry by three centuries and the most widely accepted interpretation is that the stone commemorates the Pictish victory at the historical Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 AD.|$|E
500|$|When the Great <b>Stone</b> Road <b>was</b> widened in {{the late}} 19th century, the <b>stone</b> <b>was</b> moved back from the road slightly. In 1925, the <b>stone</b> <b>was</b> moved again, to its current {{location}} outside the North Lodge of Gorse Hill Park, about [...] from its historical location. The <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> a Grade II listed structure.|$|R
50|$|Natural <b>stone</b> veneer <b>is</b> {{made from}} real <b>stone</b> that <b>is</b> either collected, i.e. fieldstone, or quarried. The <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> {{cut to a}} {{consistent}} thickness and weight {{for use as a}} veneer. This <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> often called thin stone veneer invented by Gernot Ehrlich.|$|R

5|$|Yet celebrities often held {{parties at}} the hotel, and the Rolling <b>Stones</b> <b>were</b> guests for many years. British Prime Ministers Harold Wilson, Edward Heath and Harold MacMillan often lunched at the Ritz; Heath would always reserve table 29 in the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 {{the stones}} {{in the circle}} were {{disturbed}} by agricultural activity. It was then decided that the site would be excavated, a project which was ordered by the Ministry of Public Building and Works and carried out in May 1965 under the directorship of Geoffrey J. Wainwright. The 28 <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> moved from the site using a crane to permit the archaeologists to excavate the area beneath them.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the {{archaeologist}} {{and historian}} Patrick Healy discovered {{the remains of}} a prehistoric wedge tomb in the woods. All the survives is the skeletal outline of the main chamber and the outer double walls. Most of the <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> removed to build the low stone wall that runs across the front of the tomb.|$|E
50|$|When a <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> touched when <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> in play, the {{remedies}} vary between {{placing the}} stones as {{they end up}} after the touch, replacing the stones {{as they would have}} <b>been</b> if no <b>stone</b> <b>were</b> touched, or removal of the touched stone from play. In non-officiated league play, the skip of the non-offending team has the final say on where the <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> placed after the infraction.|$|R
50|$|Note: The plural form of {{the unit}} <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> either <b>stone</b> or <b>stones,</b> but <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> most {{frequently}} used.|$|R
50|$|On Christmas Day 1950, the Westminster <b>Stone</b> <b>was</b> {{taken from}} the abbey by four Scottish students. It {{remained}} hidden until April 1951, when a <b>stone</b> <b>was</b> left in Arbroath Abbey. Some speculate that this <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> not the one {{taken from the}} Abbey, but merely a copy.|$|R
5|$|Only one runestone {{mentioning}} the Byzantine Empire {{has been found}} on Gotland. This may be due both {{to the fact that}} few rune <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> raised on Gotland in favour of image stones, {{as well as to the}} fact that the Gotlanders dealt mainly in trade, paying a yearly tribute to the Swedes for military protection.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} discoveries by Johannes Bureus {{in the late}} 16th century, these runestones have been {{frequently}} identified by scholars, with many stones discovered during a national search for historic monuments in the late 17th century. Several <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> documented by Richard Dybeck in the 19th century. The latest stone to be found was in Nolinge, near Stockholm, in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The Rolling <b>Stones</b> <b>were</b> {{the first}} major {{recording}} artists to broadcast a concert over the Internet; a 20-minute video was broadcast on 18 November 1994 using the Mbone at 10 frames per second. The broadcast, engineered by Thinking Pictures and financed by Sun Microsystems, {{was one of the}} first demonstrations of streaming video; while it was not a true webcast, it introduced many to the technology.|$|E
5000|$|A Neolithic cup {{and ring}} marked <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> located on Blackshaw Hill, near West Kilbride. This <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> unusual, {{in that it}} is carved with three spirals. [...] Although the purpose of such <b>stones</b> <b>is</b> not known, it is {{considered}} that they may have had religious importance.|$|R
40|$|Renal <b>stone</b> disease <b>is</b> {{characterized}} by the differences depending on the age, gender, and the geographic location of the patients. Seventy-five percent of the renal <b>stone</b> components <b>is</b> the calcium (Ca). The {{most common type of}} the <b>stones</b> <b>is</b> the Ca oxalate stones, while Ca phosphate, uric acid, struvite, and sistine <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> more rarely reported. Other than these types, triamterene, adenosine, silica, indinavir, and ephedrine <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> also reported in the literature as case reports. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, aluminum hydroxide <b>stones</b> <b>was</b> not reported reported before. Herein we will report a 38 -years-old woman with the history of recurrent renal colic disease whose renal <b>stone</b> <b>was</b> determined as aluminum hydroxide stone in type. Aluminum mineral may be considered in the formation of kidney <b>stones</b> as it <b>is</b> widely used in the field of healthcare and cosmetics...|$|R

5|$|The {{aqueduct}} {{was built}} of local limestone. <b>Stones</b> <b>were</b> attached {{with the use}} of pozzolana. It was this successful feature that gave most praise to Bontadini. The aqueduct supplied water to cisterns in private and public buildings, to ships in Marsamxett Harbour and Grand Harbour, and to fountains which generally included a water trough.|$|E
5|$|The royal tomb {{found in}} the royal palace G is {{designated}} hypogeum G4; it dates to the archive period, most probably the reign of Isar-Damu. The tomb is heavily damaged; most of its <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> sacked and nothing of the roof system remains. It also lacks any skeletal remains or funerary goods suggesting that it was either heavily pillaged, never used, or was built as a cenotaph.|$|E
5|$|After the Roman Empire {{collapsed}} and the aqueduct fell into disuse, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact, {{due to the}} importance of its secondary function, as a toll bridge. For centuries the local lords and bishops were responsible for its upkeep, in exchange for the right to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river, although some of its <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> looted and serious damage was inflicted on it in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination.|$|E
5000|$|Oliver <b>Stone</b> <b>is</b> {{the leader}} of the Camel Club. <b>Stone</b> <b>is</b> the crypt keeper of the Mt. Zion United Methodist Church. <b>Stone</b> <b>is</b> a false name (his real name, though rarely used, is John Carr), taken because of the real Oliver Stone's {{conspiracy}} theory-themed movies. <b>Stone</b> <b>was</b> {{a former member of the}} esteemed and fictional [...] "Triple Six" [...] division of the CIA that was composed of highly skilled government assassins. <b>Stone</b> himself <b>is</b> also monitored by the government, which constantly has agents watching him.

5|$|All {{buildings}} have been adorned with elaborate carvings and sculptures and {{were supported by}} large stone columns. These stone columns {{can be seen in}} several buildings such as the Lovamahapaya (brazen palace). Drainage systems of these buildings are also well planned, and terra cotta pipes were used to carry water to drainage pits. Large ponds were attached to some monasteries, such as the Kuttam Pokuna (twin pond). Hospital complexes have also been found close to monasteries. Buildings were constructed using timber, bricks and stones. <b>Stones</b> <b>were</b> used for foundations and columns, while brick were used for walls. Lime mortar was used for plastering walls.|$|E
5|$|Hearst first {{bought the}} monastery {{intending}} {{to replace the}} family retreat at Wyntoon, {{on the bank of}} the McCloud River near Mount Shasta in remote Northern California. The original building was his mother's Bernard Maybeck-designed fantasy chalet which burned down in 1929. Hearst wanted to replace it with a great stone building fitted with towers and turrets—an eccentric castle folly that was to be larger than its predecessor. To prepare for the arrival of the Spanish stones, Morgan drew up plans with the monastery's chapter house serving as the castle's entrance hall, and the large church enclosing a swimming pool. Other <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> designated as cladding for walls and rooms on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|If {{used as a}} {{space for}} rituals, the Hampton Down circle would have only been able to {{accommodate}} a few individuals standing within it at any given time. It was also not the site of any cremation deposits, unlike some stone circles in Northern Britain. Burl suggested that the Hampton Down Stone Circle may never {{have been part of}} the prehistoric stone circle tradition, but that the <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> actually once the kerbstones of a round barrow. To support this suggestion, he noted that round barrows were known at Poole, around 20 miles (32 kilometres) to the east of the site.|$|E
50|$|Once a {{stone and}} its prisoners reach home, any enemy <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> {{removed from the}} game, or killed. Friendly <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> liberated or {{returned}} to the set of <b>stones</b> which can <b>be</b> played.|$|R
