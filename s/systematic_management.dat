25|$|The {{history of}} the area {{can be traced back}} to 200–300 AD. A ruin of a city built by Chand Sadagar has been found in the Baghmara Forest Block. During the Mughal period, the Mughal Kings leased the forests of the Sundarbans to nearby residents. Many criminals took refuge in the Sundarbans from the {{advancing}} armies of Emperor Akbar. Many have been known to be attacked by tigers. Many of the buildings which were built by them later fell to hands of Portuguese pirates, salt smugglers and dacoits in the 17th century. Evidence of the fact can be traced from the ruins at Netidhopani and other places scattered all over Sundarbans. The legal status of the forests underwent a series of changes, including the distinction of being the first mangrove forest in the world to be brought under scientific management. The area was mapped first in Persian, by the Surveyor General as early as 1764 following soon after proprietary rights were obtained from the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II by the British East India Company in 1757. <b>Systematic</b> <b>management</b> of this forest tract started in the 1860s after the establishment of a Forest Department in the Province of Bengal, in British India. The management was entirely designed to extract whatever treasures were available, but labour and lower management mostly were staffed by locals, as the British had no expertise or adaptation experience in mangrove forests.|$|E

40|$|As {{construction}} projects become more complex, {{the understanding of}} <b>systematic</b> risk <b>management</b> requires improvement not only in risk identification, analysis and allocation {{but also in the}} management of risk in a structured and a systematic way. This PhD research aims at understanding the Iranian stakeholders' (i. e. the client, the consultant and the main contractor) attitudes to <b>systematic</b> risk <b>management</b> by comparing it with their Swedish counterparts. It aims at exploring the barriers to the implementation of; <b>systematic</b> risk <b>management</b> process in infrastructure projects in Iran. The research focuses on the stakeholders' attitudes to <b>systematic</b> risk <b>management</b> from the feasibility study stage through to production in tunnelling (infrastructure) projects. Stakeholders on the selected tunnelling projects perceive and identify different risks on their projects. However, the Iranian client does not perceive any importance in managing risk systematically and in a structured way. The Iranian consultant perceives the importance of <b>systematic</b> risk <b>management</b> but it is not paid by the client to carry out risk management. The contractor has no experience in managing the risk associated with tunnelling and relies on the foreign consultant to propose solutions {{on how to deal with}} certain risks.

40|$|Aim The aim of {{this study}} is to through {{managers}} in eldercares deskriptions of the systematic qualityleadingsystem examine the implementation process of this system in the eldercare in the municipality of Halmstad.     Background In this paper the background explains elderly care and social work context, leadership in change and implementation processes. The theoretical frame illustrates Vedungs implementation theory and Webers model of bureaucracy   Method To collect empirical data for this study, a qualitative research design was used in which eleven managers within Halmstads municipality home care management stood as respondents.   Result The respondents highlighted a variety in the use of the <b>systematic</b> quality <b>management</b> system tool. The result describes that several obstacles were experienced in the use of the systematic quality system.   Conclusion Based on the descriptions the respondents gives of the implementation process of the <b>systematic</b> quality <b>management</b> of Halmstad municipality home care management, the conclusion can be drawn that the implementation process has not resulted in the employees making use of <b>systematic</b> quality <b>management</b> in practice. The <b>systematic</b> quality <b>management</b> system that will ensure the quality of the care work is thus used to a limited extent...|$|R
6000|$|I ask {{permission}} {{to introduce a}} Bill {{for the establishment of}} a national system of Labour Exchanges. There is high authority for this proposal. The Majority and Minority representatives of the Poor Law Commission, differing in so much else, are agreed unanimously in its support. [...] "In the forefront of our proposals," [...] says the Majority Report, [...] "we place Labour Exchanges." [...] "This National Labour Exchange," [...] says the Minority Report, [...] "though in itself no adequate remedy, is the foundation of all our proposals. It is, in our view, an indispensable condition of any real reform." [...] The National Conference of Trade Union Delegates, convened by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress, of March 19, 1909, resolved unanimously: [...] "That this Conference of Trade Union delegates, representing 1,400,000 members, approves of the establishment of Labour Exchanges on a national basis, under the control of the Board of Trade, provided that the managing board contains at least an equal proportion of employers and representatives of Trade Unions." [...] The Central Unemployed Body for London, by a Resolution in June 1908, declared in favour of a national system of Labour Exchanges. Economists as divergent in opinion as Professor Ashley, of Birmingham, and Professor Chapman, of Manchester, have all approved and urged the project publicly in the strongest terms. Several of the principal members of the late Government have, either in evidence before the Poor Law Commission or in public speeches, expressed themselves in favour of Labour Exchanges, and the Report of the delegates of the Labour Party to Germany strongly approves of the system which they found there, namely: [...] "the co-ordination and <b>systematic</b> <b>management</b> of Public Labour Exchanges." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to make a survey of a larger company in Sweden to analyze if it {{complied}} to the stipulated <b>Systematic</b> Work Environment <b>Management</b> rules in Sweden. The company chosen was Hennes & Mauritz. The key question was to see if the company was examining and judging the risks, developing handling plans and if they were making yearly follow ups so that problems could be attended to. Further, I also wanted to examine if there was lack of competence within different departments as well as give some substantiate proposals on educations in <b>Systematic</b> Work Environment <b>Management.</b> The method used to investigate this was interviews and observations on how the <b>Systematic</b> Work Environment <b>Management</b> was handled in the company. The interview study included ten different directors of stores. The observation was made during two weeks at the headquarter following the daily work concerning the <b>Systematic</b> Work Environment <b>Management</b> from management´s point of view. The result of the study and the observation showed that in general H&M is working very well with the <b>Systematic</b> Work Environment <b>Management</b> at the store level. The local managers considered that they had sufficient knowledge but they were lacking continuous education and updates in the area. Specifically, the results showed that there is some lack of knowledge in the field of responsibility for work environment and that the local management doesn’t get the yearly education according to top management´s intention. A short suggestion on a yearly educational plan in <b>Systematic</b> Work Environment <b>Management</b> has been added to the report based on the results in the survey. A reasonable time for this education is one day per year to update the responsible local management in the area of <b>Systematic</b> Work Environment <b>Management...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Co-morbid major {{depression}} occurs in approximately 10 % of {{people suffering from}} a chronic medical condition such as cancer. <b>Systematic</b> integrated <b>management</b> that includes both identification and treatment has been advocated. However, we lack information on the cost-effectiveness of this combined approach, as published evaluations have focused solely on the systematic (collaborative care) treatment stage. We therefore aimed to use the best available evidence to estimate the cost-effectiveness of <b>systematic</b> integrated <b>management</b> (both identification and treatment) compared with usual practice, for patients attending specialist cancer clinics. METHOD: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytic model structured to reflect both the identification and treatment processes. Evidence was taken from reviews of relevant clinical trials and from observational studies, together with data from a large depression screening service. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were undertaken {{to determine the effects}} of variations in depression incidence rates, time horizons and patient characteristics. RESULTS: <b>Systematic</b> integrated depression <b>management</b> generated more costs than usual practice, but also more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £ 11, 765 per QALY. This finding was robust to tests of uncertainty and variation in key model parameters. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Systematic</b> integrated <b>management</b> of co-morbid {{major depression}} in cancer patients is likely to be cost-effective at widely accepted threshold values and may be a better way of generating QALYs for cancer patients than some existing medical and surgical treatments. It could usefully be applied to other chronic medical conditions...|$|R

50|$|The fifth marquess {{recognized}} that the woodlands needed to be made commercially viable. Included among the 778,000 trees he planted were {{a high proportion of}} softwoods, placed outside the forest's core (e.g.: Birch Copse in the SE). This warden was too deeply imbued with tradition to contemplate industrialized forestry but he was the first of his family to introduce a measure of <b>systematic</b> <b>management</b> of larch and spruce plantations. Chandos Bruce, the sixth marquess, did everything possible to carry on with this combination of <b>systematic</b> <b>management</b> and concern for amenity and symbolic representation. Eventually, however, he found the burden too heavy due to increasing costs, Lloyd George's taxes on inherited wealth, and the impossibility of hiring enough labour during and after the First World War. In 1930 he approached the government Forestry Commission but drew back when he recognised that surrendering control would probably bring on an invasion by ranks of straight-backed conifers. Eight years later the commission became more open to the suggestion that recreational uses might be as legitimate as commercial ones and agreed to the special conditions the sixth marquess had stubbornly laid down. As a result, after 800 years of wardenship, the family surrendered control and the public, because of Lord Ailesbury's dedication, gained a handsome amenity.|$|E
