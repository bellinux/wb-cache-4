40|$|A 14 -year {{study of}} <b>snag</b> {{characteristics}} {{was established in}} 41 - to 44 -year old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands in southeastern USA. During the initial 5. 5 years, no stand manipulation or unusually high-mortality events occurred. Afterwards, three treatments were applied consisting of trees thinned and removed, trees felled and not removed, and artificial creation of <b>snags</b> produced by girdling and herbicide injection. The thinned treatments were designed to maintain the same live canopy density as the snag-created treatment, disregarding <b>snags</b> that remained standing. We monitored <b>snag</b> height, diameter, density, volume, and bark percentage; the number of cavities was monitored in natural <b>snags</b> only. During the first 5. 5 years, recruitment and loss rates were stable, resulting in a stable <b>snag</b> population. Large <b>snags</b> (≥ 25 cm diameter) were common, but subcanopy small <b>snags</b> (10 to < 25 cm diameter) dominated numerically. Large natural <b>snags</b> survived (90 % quantile) significantly longer (6. 0 – 9. 4 years) than smaller <b>snags</b> (4. 4 – 6. 9 years). Large artificial <b>snags</b> persisted the longest (11. 8 years). Cavities in natural <b>snags</b> developed within 3 years following tree death. The mean number of cavities per <b>snag</b> was five times greater in large versus small <b>snags</b> and large <b>snags</b> {{were more likely to}} have multiple cavities, emphasizing the importance of mature pine stands for cavity-dependent wildlife species...|$|R
30|$|<b>Snags</b> were {{evaluated}} for 10  years after death. Over 35 % of the <b>snags</b> were still {{standing by the}} end of the observation period. These <b>snags</b> were considered right-censored (i.e., <b>snags</b> were followed for a set amount of time rather than until all <b>snags</b> in our sample population fell). In addition to the right-censoring, several <b>snags</b> had years in which they were not measured. If these <b>snags</b> were standing before the missed observation, but down at the next observation, the censoring was assumed to be non-informative and those <b>snags</b> were considered to be standing for the missing years. This is the standard protocol for such interval censoring (Kleinbaum and Klein 2010).|$|R

One of the men who had carried out the procedure for Yoke was then also found to have burns on his hands and was hospitalized too, but was discharged on 28 May. Once again the drone tank gave trouble, and bogged in the crater, but the soil samples were retrieved by the backup drone tank. Both tanks were subsequently dumped in the ocean.|$|E

40|$|<b>Snags</b> (standing dead trees) provide {{important}} habitat for forest wildlife, {{as well as}} a source of coarse woody debris important in forest succession. Because of their importance, some land-management agencies have standards for <b>snag</b> retention on lands under their jurisdiction (e. g. U. S. Forest Service, British Columbia Ministry of Forestry). Despite these guidelines, however, little information is typically available on <b>snag</b> numbers or dynamics on these lands. As part of a long-term effort to monitor <b>snag</b> dynamics, <b>snag</b> populations were sampled on 114 1 -ha plots randomly located across six Ranger Districts on two National Forests in northern Arizona. Sixty plots were located in ponderosa pine forest, with the remainder in mixed-conifer forest. Small <b>snags</b> and <b>snags</b> in later decay classes numerically dominated <b>snag</b> populations. Because large <b>snags</b> are most useful to forest wildlife, this suggests a need to retain large trees as future <b>snags.</b> Only 6. 7 and 16. 7 % of plots in ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forest, respectively, met or exceeded current U. S. Forest Service standards for retention of large <b>snags</b> (de®ned as <b>snags</b> 46 cm in diameter at breast height and 9 m in height) in this geographic region. Even plots with no evidence of timber or fuelwood harvest seldom met targets for retention of large <b>snags,</b> however. Only 30 and 32 % of unlogged plots met or exceeded standards in ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forest, respectively. This suggests that current standards for <b>snag</b> retention may be unrealistic, and that those standards may need to be reconsidered. <b>Snag</b> guidelines should be based on an understanding of both, <b>snag</b> dynamics and the requirements of snag-dependent wildlife species. # 199...|$|R

30|$|<b>Snags</b> and downed logs are {{essential}} to forest ecosystems, providing numerous ecosystem benefits, but also contributing to fuel loading (Dunn and Bailey 2015). This study provides post-fire <b>snag</b> persistence information for five conifer species to aid land managers in meeting snag-related forest objectives. <b>Snag</b> age and DBH were the strongest predictors of fire-killed <b>snag</b> persistence. For all species, smaller-diameter <b>snags</b> fell more quickly than larger <b>snags,</b> with white fir and sugar pine <b>snags</b> over 50  cm DBH and yellow pine over 90  cm DBH predicted to persist much longer than smaller <b>snags.</b> Incense-cedar <b>snags</b> were fairly stable, {{but they are not}} as widely used by wildlife as the other species studied (Thomas 1979; Morrison et al. 1987; Bagne et al. 2008) and therefore may not be the preferred tree species for <b>snag</b> retention for wildlife objectives in a post-fire management scenario. However, incense-cedar could be useful for other objectives such as carbon storage. White fir and sugar pine <b>snags</b> both persisted for an extended time on the landscape and are moderately used by wildlife (Thomas 1979; Morrison et al. 1987; Ganey and Vojta 2004; Bagne et al. 2008). Although yellow pine <b>snags</b> are widely used by wildlife, virtually all yellow pine fell within 10  years of dying. In addition, we found FFE-FVS greatly over-predicted yellow pine fire-killed <b>snag</b> persistence and recommend revising the equations in the software to reflect the consistently reported finding of fast fall rates in yellow pine. <b>Snags</b> and logs provide numerous ecosystem benefits (e.g., wildlife habitat, nutrient cycling, germination microsites), but also can potentially increase future fire severity. Our results can be used to inform post-fire <b>snag</b> management considerations.|$|R

Mean <b>snag</b> density was 28. 4 snags/ha and mean <b>snag</b> diameter (DBH) and height were 20. 3 cm and 9. 9 m, respectively. Highest <b>snag</b> densities occurred in hardwood stand types; pine plantations had lower (p 0. 05) <b>snag</b> density than all other types. Within a particular stand type, <b>snag</b> densities, recruitment rates, and loss rates generally were lowest in the oldest age classes.

Young pine plantations had the lowest recruitment rate (x 1. 79 snags/ha/year) and old pine plantations had the lowest loss rate (x 1. 59 snags/ha/year) of all the stand type–age class combinations. Although twenty species of <b>snags</b> were observed, five species/species groups, shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), red oaks (Quercus spp.), white oaks (Quercus spp.), loblolly pine (P. taeda), and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), occurred most frequently. <b>Snag</b> DBH and cavities/snag were not significantly correlated.

For the twelve 1 ha plots, field methods included mapping and measuring 15 characteristics for 668 <b>snags</b> (630 in burned and 38 in unburned plots) 4 years post-fire on the H 96 fire, and 1010 <b>snags</b> (996 in burned and 14 in unburned plots) 1 year post-fire on the P 00 fire. We remeasured characteristics of all <b>snags</b> in 2003. Most burned <b>snags</b> were standing 3 years after fire, but 7 years after fire, 41 % had fallen. <b>Snags</b> in burned plots were clumped when initially measured and remeasured. After 7 years, <b>snags</b> in burned plots that were still standing were straight, large diameter trees in denser clumps. Density of excavated cavities was similar between burned (3. 0 ha 1) and unburned (2. 2 ha 1) plots, even though burned areas producedmuch higher densities of <b>snags.</b> <b>Snags</b> (both burned and unburned) that {{were most likely to}} contain excavated cavities were large diameter with broken tops. This evidence of cavity nester use indicates tha...|$|R
