5000|$|A {{variant of}} the octal base, the B8G loctal base or lock-in base (sometimes spelled [...] "loktal" [...] - trademarked by Sylvania), was {{developed}} by Sylvania for ruggedized applications such as automobile radios. Along with B8B (a British designation out of date by 1958), these eight-pin locking bases are almost identical and the names usually taken as interchangeable (although there are some minor differences in specifications, such as spigot material and spigot taper, etc.). The pin geometry {{was the same as}} for octal, but the pins were thinner (although they will fit into a standard octal socket, they wobble and do not make good contact), the base shell was made of aluminium, and the center hole had an electrical contact that also mechanically locked (hence [...] "loctal") the tube in place. Loctal tubes were only used widely by a few equipment manufacturers, most notably Philco, which used the tubes in many table radios. Loctal tubes have a small indexing mark {{on the side of the}} base skirt; they do not release easily from their sockets unless pushed from that side. Because the pins are actually the Fernico or Cunife lead-out wires from the tube itself, they are prone to intermittent connections caused by the build-up of electrolytic corrosion products due to the pin being of a different metallic composition to the <b>socket</b> <b>contact.</b>|$|E
40|$|Integrated Circuit (IC) sockets provide {{hundreds}} {{to thousands}} of electrical interconnects in enterprise servers, where quality and reliability are critical for customer applications. The evaluation of IC sockets, according to current industry practices, relies on the execution of stress loads and stress levels that are defined by standards, having no consideration to the physics of failure (PoF), target operating environment, or contact resistance behavior over time. In a similar manner, monitoring of contact resistance during system operation has no considerations to the PoF or environmental conditions.

40|$|During system {{level testing}} {{intermittent}} and permanent open circuit failures of mated, crimp removable, electrical contact pairs were experienced. The {{root cause of}} the failures {{was determined to be}} low (but not zero) contact forces applied by the <b>socket</b> <b>contact</b> tines against the engaging pin. The low contact force reduces the effectiveness of the wiping action of the socket tines against the pin. The observed failure mode may be produced when insufficient wiping during mate, demate and small relative movement in use allows for the accumulation of debris or insulating films that electrically separate the contact pair. The investigation identified at least three manufacturing process control problems associated with the socket contacts that enabled shipment of contacts susceptible to developing low contact forces: (1) Improper heat treatment of the socket tines resulting in plastic rather than elastic behavior; (2) Overly thinned socket tines at their base resulting in reduced pin retention forces; (3) insufficient screening tests to identify parts susceptible to the aforementioned failure mechanisms. The results from an extensive screening program of socket contacts utilizing the industry standard contact separation force test procedures are described herein. The investigation shows this method to be capable of identifying initially weak sockets. However, sockets whose contact retention forces may degrade during use may not be screened out by pin retention testing alone. Further investigations are required to correlate low contact retention forces with increased electrical contact resistance in the presence of insulating films that may accumulate in the use environment...|$|E

40|$|A {{proposed}} tool {{would be}} used to inspect alignments of mating twinaxial-connector assemblies on interconnecting wiring harnesses. More specifically, the tool {{would be used}} to inspect the alignment of each contact pin of each connector on one assembly with the corresponding socket in the corresponding connector on the other assembly. It is necessary to inspect the alignment because if mating of the assemblies is attempted when any pin/socket pair is misaligned beyond tolerance, the connection will not be completed and the dielectric material in the socket will be damaged (see Figure 1). Although the basic principle of the tool is applicable to almost any type of mating connector assemblies, the specific geometry of the tool must match the pin-and-socket geometry of the specific mating assemblies to be inspected. In the original application for which the tool was conceived, each of the mating assemblies contains eight twinaxial connectors; the pin diameter is 0. 014 in. (. 0. 35 mm), and the maximum allowable pin/socket misalignment is 0. 007 in. (. 0. 18 mm). Incomplete connections can result in loss of flight data within the functional path to the space shuttle crew cockpit displays. The tool (see Figure 2) would consist mainly of a transparent disk with alignment clocking tabs that can be fitted onto either connector assembly. Sets of circles or equivalent reference markings are affixed to the face of the tool, located at the desired positions of the mating contact pairs. An inspector would simply fit the tool onto a connector assembly, engaging the clocking tabs until the tool fits tightly. The inspector would then align one set of circles positioning a line of sight perpendicular to one contact within the connector assembly. Mis alignments would be evidenced by the tip of a pin contact straying past the inner edge of the circle. <b>Socket</b> <b>contact</b> misalignments would be evidenced by a crescent-shaped portion of the white dielectric appearing within the circle. The tool could include a variable magnifier plus an illuminator that could be configured so as not to cast shadows...|$|E
40|$|In {{the twenty-first}} century, new {{cutting-edge}} osseointegration technology is improving quality of life. Osseointegration {{is a new}} technique to suspend an implant prosthetic device for individuals with a limb-loss. The science of osseointegration is not clearly understood although {{there appears to be}} a special relationship between pure titanium that promotes activation of our bone building cells and bone remodeling. Direct bone-anchored osseointegration to integrate a foreign device into the body without the body rejecting the prosthesis is the new technology lacking knowledge and research clinical cases for human translation. The objective of the case study was to review the science of bone-anchored osseointegration as a limb-salvaging technique and potential translation to humans using a canine model in a well-defined control study. Aims were to enhance knowledge technology, improve mobility, decrease pain to improve quality of life and influence health care practices. By the year 2050, the projected number of American amputees is expected to reach 3. 6 million. Many people depend on artificial limbs to perform their activities of daily living. Often these limbs start developing complications associated with stump-socket designs such as separation from the human tissue, poor fit with repeated fittings, recurrent skin infections, ulcers and pressure sores due to non-uniform pressure distribution over the <b>socket</b> <b>contact</b> area and pain which decreases their mobility. Since 2001, close to 28, 500 American troops have been wounded in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. Greater than 24, 600 of them have survived their injury, the highest survival rate of any war in the history of the United States. Sadly, 700 of these services members have lost at least one limb from amputations. Lower limb amputations are still performed above the knee as not enough bone can be preserved below the knee for prosthesis. Osseointegration with limb-salvaging techniques could enhance mobility and quality of life for those individuals who sacrifice their limbs defending our freedoms...|$|E

A methodology was developed for modeling and monitoring contact resistance of electrical interconnects. The technique combined a PoF model with the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). In the methodology the resistance behavior is characterized as a function of temperature. The effective a-spot radius was extracted from the characterization data and modeled with a power-law. A PoF model was developed to estimate the resistance of an elastomer contact, based on the effective a-spot radius and the ambient temperature. The methodology was experimentally demonstrated with a temperature cycle test of the elastomer socket. During the evaluation the difference between estimated and observed resistance values were tested with the SPRT. The technique was shown to be very accurate for modeling contact resistance and to be highly sensitive for the detection of resistance degradation. A qualitative reliability model was developed for the mean contact resistance of an elastomer socket, using fundamental material properties and user defined failure criteria. To derive the model, the resistance behavior of contacts under nominal mechanical load was studied as a function of time and temperature. The elastomer contact was shown to have a very complex resistance behavior, which was modeled by multiple statistical distributions. It was shown that elastomer sockets, in spite of experiencing stress relaxation at the macroscale (elastomer), can exhibit decreases in contact resistance, a result of stress redistribution at the microscale (Ag particles), which increases Ag-Ag particle stress and the effective contact area...|$|E

In this project, we investigate the UHMWPE/MWCNTs nanocomposites reinforced with MWCNTs at different concentrations. The samples were treated with cold argon plasma at different exposure times. The water contact angles for 60 min plasma-treated nanocomposites with 0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 wt % MWCNTs were found to be 55. 65 °, 52. 51 °, 48. 01 °, 43. 72 °, and 37. 18 ° respectively. Increasing the treatment time of nanocomposites has shown transformation from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic nature due to carboxyl groups being bonded on the surface for treated nanocomposites.
