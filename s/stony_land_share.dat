Results for the representative farms indicate that income variations are due to economies of size, differences in crop yields (experimental or farm level) and type of reclamation method used. The market values for <b>stony</b> <b>lands</b> (determined by regression technique) are higher compared with the productive values. Analysis also indicates that crop production is feasible within the parameters defined {{and that it is}} more economical to develop unutilized <b>stony</b> <b>land</b> rather than purchase prime agricultural land at current market prices.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} agronomic and {{economic}} feasibility of utilizing <b>stony</b> <b>lands</b> for crop production in South-Western Quebec where stoniness {{is the major}} constraint. Field experiments conducted on stony soils indicated significant differences in yields of grain corn and silage corn between stone treatments. With oats, however, {{there were no significant}} differences in yields. Regression analysis of bare land values indicated an inverse relationship between size of <b>stony</b> <b>land</b> and unit price. A similar relationship also existed for land clearing and reclamation machinery costs for different farm sizes. Linear programming optimization for farms within two agricultural sub-zones showed that variation in net income is due to economies of scale, differences in yields and subsidy arrangements. For small farms, additional subsidy is required to make them economically attractive. Post-optimal procedures indicated that the base solutions are more sensitive to crop yields and prices than reclamation costs. The study concludes that crop production on <b>stony</b> <b>lands</b> is feasible within the parameters defined and that it might be more economical for an operator to develop under-utilized reserves of <b>stony</b> <b>lands</b> rather than purchase prime land at current market prices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Human {{activities}} are causing a biodiversity crisis in all biomes of the Earth. As the world's population continues to grow, more land will {{be converted to}} agricultural land to meet the growing food demands, especially in the tropics where we find the most species rich habitats in the world. Many of these species and ecosystems provide valuable services to the humans living here. To best protect species richness and the people dependent on rural livelihoods in the tropics, two types of managed agricultural landscapes have been suggested: land sparing and <b>land</b> <b>sharing.</b> <b>Land</b> sparing promotes high yield agriculture {{in order to have}} as large an area as possible protected, while <b>land</b> <b>sharing</b> is farming a more extensive area of the landscape, but is able to retain more species and ecosystem services by using agricultural methods such as agroforestry. The potential for conservation and retaining ecosystem services in a <b>land</b> <b>sharing</b> or a <b>land</b> sparing type landscape in Uganda is addressed using data about insectivorous bats recorded with Anabat detectors in habitats from sugarcane, home garden and forest in and around Budongo forest, Uganda. Species richness, diversity, activity and species composition were determined for all habitats and used to give a picture of the conservation value of the different habitat types. As found in other studies both agricultural landscape types have a higher species richness and diversity than the forest habitat. But the higher activity and number of species related to the forest gives the home garden landscape better potential for conservation of microbats. Scattered trees and distance to the forest in the sugarcane landscape type does not add any conservation value compared to the sugarcane habitat. This study helps to demonstrate the value of <b>land</b> <b>sharing</b> type agriculture for conserving species richness and retaining ecosystem services...|$|R
