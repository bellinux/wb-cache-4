5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey {{to have an}} open {{container}} of alcohol in the passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported {{in the trunk of}} a car, and consumption of alcohol on a bus, train, taxi, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions, but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} Medicaid {{expansion}} under the Affordable Care Act {{was to make}} health care more accessible to low-income populations. By early 2015, 28 states had expanded Medicaid eligibility. The expansion by some states but not by others provides {{a unique opportunity to}} examine the impact of this new policy on changes in health insurance coverage. Moreover, as the newly elected Republican President and the Republican-controlled Congress consider the future of health care reform, understanding the efficacy of components of the Affordable Care Act, such as Medicaid expansion, will be essential for continuing efforts to increase coverage rates and subsequently minimize the associated consequences of low coverage rates. In this brief, author Danielle Rhubart reports <b>that</b> counties in <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not expand Medicaid compared to counties in <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> experienced significantly smaller increases in non-elderly adult health insurance coverage between 2013 and 2015, even after controlling for other county characteristics. Counties in <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not expand Medicaid compared to counties in <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> had larger shares of the vulnerable populations. Within <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not expand Medicaid, counties with larger shares of vulnerable residents experienced smaller improvements in health insurance coverage rates than did counties with smaller shares of vulnerable residents. She concludes that any proposed revisions to the ACA, and especially the curtailment of Medicaid, would reduce county-level insurance coverage rates and thus require counties {{to find new ways to}} deal with an increase in uninsured non-elderly adults. For counties with large shares of vulnerable populations located in <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not expand Medicaid, leaders interested in reducing the impact of lack of health insurance coverage should focus on increasing access to low-cost health care and preventive health...|$|R
