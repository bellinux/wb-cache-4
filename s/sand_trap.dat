5|$|It is {{believed}} that initial investigations into the treatment of Afghan detainees sparked investigations into Canada's elite military unit, Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2). The first investigation, named <b>Sand</b> <b>Trap,</b> examined allegations that a JTF2 member {{was involved in the}} 2006 shooting death of an Afghan who was surrendering. No charges were laid {{at the conclusion of the}} investigation. However, a larger investigation called <b>Sand</b> <b>Trap</b> II began hearing from witnesses in May 2009 regarding allegations of JTF2 members witnessing United States armed forces killing an unarmed man. This investigation is still being conducted by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service, and it has led to calls for civilian oversight of JTF2.|$|E
5|$|As per his contract, Webber {{started the}} year in Melbourne with Red Bull Racing. He {{recorded}} top-six lap times {{in each of the}} three practice sessions, and was on his way to the top ten in the qualifying session when the front right brake disc in his car failed going into turn 6 during Q2, sending him spinning off into the <b>sand</b> <b>trap</b> ending his qualifying session, and resulting in 15th position on the grid. Although starting well, he momentarily went off the track at turn 1 to avoid being involved in contact that had already erupted. Webber made several positions by turn 3 but an incident involving himself, Kazuki Nakajima and Anthony Davidson when he was slightly contacted by Davidson whilst trying to avoid the struggle between the other two drivers, ended his race.|$|E

He reluctantly, but doggedly, pursues Justine throughout the wedding reception. She cannot consummate her marriage with her husband and goes out onto a <b>sand</b> <b>trap</b> and has sex with Tim. Tim is later fired for his failure, and Justine aggressively resigns. Justine and Michael talk and decide that their marriage was a failure. Michael departs. Early the following morning, while horseback riding with Claire, Justine notices Antares is no longer visible in the sky.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the biggest}} {{incident}} {{of the year}} happened at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. With two laps remaining, Senna held a five-second lead over the Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto, who were {{closing in on the}} McLaren (Prost had earlier retired with a badly misfiring engine). Going into the Rettifilo Chicane, Senna closed on the Williams of Jean-Louis Schlesser (standing in for a sick Nigel Mansell). Schlesser steered wide, attempting to give Senna room to lap him, losing then regaining control to avoid going into the <b>sand</b> <b>trap.</b> Unfortunately, Senna did not give the Williams room and took his normal racing line. Subsequently, Senna's McLaren was T-boned and ended up beached on a curb with broken rear suspension. Ferrari would go on to an emotional 1–2 finish, the first in an Italian Grand Prix since the death of the team's founder Enzo Ferrari. This would prove to be the only race McLaren did not win in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Chaz Mostert {{took his}} first V8 Supercar pole {{position}} when he qualified fastest for the first race of the Ubet Perth Super Sprint. His teammate Mark Winterbottom qualified second {{and went on to}} score pole position for the second race. Winterbottom made a better start than Mostert in the first race and the pair went on to finish first and second, while Craig Lowndes finished in third. Jamie Whincup, after qualifying in 21st place, managed to finish in 15th place but lost the championship lead to Lowndes. Winterbottom won the second race ahead of Whincup and Fabian Coulthard. With Lowndes finishing fifth, Winterbottom took the championship lead. Mostert took his second pole in qualifying for the Sunday race. The session saw Lee Holdsworth make a mistake at turn six and his car rolled onto its side after digging into the <b>sand</b> <b>trap.</b> Despite starting off the front row, Mostert and Winterbottom finished fourth and 15th respectively after their tyre strategy was ruined by a safety car on lap 48. Will Davison won the race, taking Erebus Motorsport's second ever victory, after passing Lowndes for the lead with five laps remaining. Coulthard finished third despite starting 24th. With Winterbottom finishing down the order, Lowndes left the event with the championship lead.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} construction, a <b>sand</b> <b>trap</b> {{immediately}} {{to the south of}} the sea opening was incorporated into the design to capture sand buildup from the natural south to north movement along the coast caused by the predominant south-westerly winds.

2500|$|Lockheed won the X-608 {{proposal}} {{with their}} twin-engine Model 22 design, signing {{a contract with}} the Air Corps in June 1937. Kelsey flew the first prototype of the P-38 Lightning, the XP-38, on January 27, 1939. After Lockheed performed a series of tests and associated engineering adjustments, Kelsey took the prototype across the country on a record-breaking speed flight in February 1939. Just short of his goal, as he was directed into the landing pattern at Mitchel Field behind three slow trainer aircraft, his prototype's carburetors iced up and the engines would not respond—they continued to idle and would not increase in power. Without the ability to add power, Kelsey fell short of the runway and belly-landed into a <b>sand</b> <b>trap</b> at a golf course, destroying the plane but suffering only minor scratches himself. General Henry [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold was very happy with the speed demonstration and ordered Kelsey to proceed with further development of the design. In May, Kelsey was promoted to the rank of captain.|$|E

40|$|The current {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate six different free stall surface options and their impact on stall usage and comfort, bedding usage, animal cleanliness and health, and economics. Results showed significantly different stall usages with different stall surfaces and a significant stall surface by week or season interaction. Sand stalls showed significantly higher usage in summer, followed by sand stall with <b>sand</b> <b>traps,</b> Pasture and Agromatic mattresses, and Dynamat rubber mats, respectively. <b>Sand</b> with <b>Sand</b> <b>Traps</b> and both Pasture Mats showed significantly higher stall usage during the fall and winter weeks (no differences between them) and Dynamat rubber mats showed the lowest usage in all 3 periods. The addition of <b>Sand</b> <b>Traps</b> to the <b>sand</b> stalls significantly reduced sand usage (69 %). Greater variation in usage was seen with sand and Dynamats, as compared to the 4 other surfaces. This research substantiates differences in cow preferences for stall surface materials depending on season, temperature, surface hardness, and surface maintenance...|$|R

In a twist of fate, as Richards was sliding off into the <b>sand</b> <b>trap</b> at Bathurst, George Fury, who Richards had just lapped, joined him having gone off on the same oil.
