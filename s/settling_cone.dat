40|$|A {{polysulfone}} ultrafilter membrane {{having a}} 0. 04 -{micro}m pore opening {{has been used}} to filter high explosive contaminated water. The water is being recycled for the coolant used during the machining of high explosive billets. High explosive contaminated wastewater is generated from the machining of high explosives at Pantex Plant. The water is used as the coolant during the machining operation. Typically, the water flow rate is from 2 to 3 gallons per minute. The water must be tempered to about room temperature so that it does not affect the dimensions of the explosive piece being machined. In normal operations, the wastewater and cuttings are allowed to flow to a centralized collection system. The solid explosives are separated from the water using a filtration and recycle system. The wastewater is collected in an air agitated receiving tank or sump. It is pumped from the sump to a <b>settling</b> <b>cone</b> where the solid particles are decanted off of the bottom. The overflow from the cone is collected in another tank and then pumped through two cyclone separators operated in series. This water is also collected in a holding tank prior to final filtration through a 25 -{micro}m filter. The effluent from the particle filter flows through two activated carbon filters operated in series prior to being discharged to a drainage ditch. This results in an average discharge of about 2, 000 gallons per operating day from Building 11 - 50...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{evaluation}} of two commonly used coagulation–flocculation aids (alum and ferric chloride) was {{conducted for the}} supernatant overflow from <b>settling</b> <b>cones</b> used to treat the effluent from microscreen filters in an intensive recirculating aquaculture system. In addition to determining {{the effectiveness of these}} aids in removing both suspended solids and phosphorus, a systematic testing of the variables normally encountered in the coagulation–flocculation process was performed. Tests were carried out to evaluate the dosages and conditions (mixing and flocculation stirring speeds, durations, and settling times) required to achieve optimum waste capture. The orthophosphate removal efficiency for alum and ferric chloride were 89 and 93 %, respectively, at a dosage of 90 mg/l. Optimum turbidity removal was achieved with a 60 mg/l dosage for both alum and ferric chloride. Both alum and ferric chloride demonstrated excellent removal of suspended solids from initial TSS values of approximately 100 – 10 mg/l at a dosage of 90 mg/l. Flocculation and mixing speed played only a minor role in the removal efficiencies for both orthophosphates and suspended solids. Both coagulation–flocculation aids also exhibited excellent settling characteristics, with the majority of the floc quickly settling out in the first 5 min...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Marine {{aggregates}} {{were evaluated}} for their potential {{role in the}} ecology of aquatic pathogens using underwater video surveys coupled with direct collection of aggregates in modified <b>settling</b> <b>cones.</b> Six locations, two each in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, were surveyed over 8 months to explore differences in the characteristics of aggregates found in habitats populated by clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) and oysters (Cras-sostrea virginica). Microaggregate ( 500 lm) concentrations, but peak concentrations of macroaggregates and microaggregates, mean size of particles, and volume fraction of aggregated material varied among the six shallow-water habitats. Concentrations (colony-forming units per ml) of total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) and total mesophilic pathogenic bacteria (MPB) from samples of aggregates were significantly different among the four locations bordering Long Island Sound (LIS). The highest concentrations and enrichment factors in aggregates were observed in August for THB and in June for MPB. Significant correlations were detected for salinity and the concentrations and enrichment factors of THB in aggregates and for the concentrations and percentages of MPB in seawater samples. Significant correlations were also detected for temperature and the concentrations of MPB in aggregates and the enrichment factors for THB and MPB (marginal significance). Bacterial species identified in association with aggregates included: Vibrio cholerea, V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, V. alginolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa...|$|R
40|$|A quasi-one-dimensional {{model of}} the process of {{continuous}} sedimentation in clarifier-thickeners (settlers) with variable cross-sectional area is presented. The partial differential equation (PDE) model extends the settler model advanced by Bürger et al. (2013), which assumes a constant cross section. A reliable numerical method that handles the special features of the nonlinear PDE is presented along with an advantageous time-step condition for continuous and batch sedimentation under the condition of a variable cross-sectional area. Simulations of continuous sedimentation show the effect of change of cross-sectional area in the concentration inside the vessel and in the underflow. Simulations of batch <b>settling</b> in <b>cones</b> illustrate the versatility of the numerical scheme to include a vertex, where the area shrinks to zero...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{epizootiology}} is {{the study}} of environmental influences on the health of animals including disease incidence, persistence and transmission. It is a conceptual approach that unifies molecular biology, environmental sciences, and epidemiology for the purpose of identifying causes, classifying risks, and controlling health problems. Ecological epizootiology has been successfully applied in terrestrial systems, but its adaptation to marine ecosystems is relatively new. My dissertation uses this approach to evaluate the role of marine aggregates (i. e., marine snow, organic aggregates, flocs) in the ecology of Quahog Parasite X (QPX), a disease of northern quahogs (=hard clam), Mercenaria mercenaria. Marine aggregates are a ubiquitous feature of aquatic ecosystems, but have no terrestrial counterpart. They have the potential to serve as a link between aquatic pathogens (e. g., QPX) and benthic hosts (e. g., hard clams) in two ways: (1) as environmental reservoirs for pathogens embedded in aggregates; and (2) as vectors for aggregate-bound pathogens transported between hosts. The results of this research include the descriptive epizootiology of QPX disease in hard clams, along with the first quantitative assay for the QPX organism, and data to support QPX as a facultative pathogen. Evidence that QPX is facultative is critical because it supports that once QPX is established in a location, eradication will be difficult because QPX is capable of surviving on environmental resources other than hard clams. In this research, marine aggregates were characterized using underwater video surveys coupled with direct collection of suspended aggregates in modified <b>settling</b> <b>cones.</b> The results provide a starting point for determining the temporal and spatial scales at which aggregates influence persistence and transmission of aquatic pathogens. Overall, these results have important implications for the way in which aquatic pathogens are collected, quantified, and monitored for water quality assessments in shallow-water ecosystems. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{water sample}} to be {{measured}} should {{be representative of the}} total stream. Samples are best collected from the discharge falling from a pipe or over a weir, because samples skimmed from the top of a flowing channel may fail to capture larger, high-density solids moving along the bottom of the channel. The sampling bucket is vigorously stirred to uniformly re-suspend all collected solids immediately before pouring the volume required to fill the cone. The filled cone is immediately placed in a stationary holding rack to allow quiescent settling. The rack should be located away from heating sources, including direct sunlight, which might cause currents within the cone from thermal density changes of the liquid contents. After 45 minutes of <b>settling,</b> the <b>cone</b> is partially rotated about its axis of symmetry just enough to dislodge any settled material adhering {{to the side of the}} cone. Accumulated sediment is observed and measured fifteen minutes later, after one hour of total settling time.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this project was to evaluate the utility of a device called the {open_quotes}beach cone{close_quotes} in combating coastal erosion. Seven initial sites were selected for testing beach cones {{in a variety of}} geometric configurations. Permits were obtained from the State of Louisiana and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers to perform the work associated with this study. Six hundred beach cones were actually installed at six of the sites in late July and early August, 1992. Findings indicate that beach cones accreted significant amounts of materials along the beach of a barrier island, and they might have been instrumental in repairing an approximately 200 meter gap in the island. At the eighth installation the amount of accreted material was measured by surveys to be 2200 cubic meters (2900 cubic yards) in February of 1993, when the cones were found to have been completely covered by the material. At other test sites, accretion rates have been less dramatic but importantly, no significant additional erosion has occurred, which is a positive result. The cost of sediment accretion using beach cones was found to be about $ 13. 72 per cubic yard, which would be much lower if the cones were mass produced (on the order of $ 3. 00 per cubic yard). The survival of the cones through the fringes of Hurricane Andrew indicates that they can be anchored sufficiently to survive significant storms. The measurements of the <b>cones</b> <b>settling</b> rates indicate that this effect is not significant enough to hinder their effectiveness. A subcontract to Xavier University to assess the ecological quality of the experimental sites involved the study of the biogeochemical cycle of trace metals. The highest concentration of heavy metals were near a fishing camp while the lowest levels were in the beach sand of a barrier island. This suggests that the metals do not occur naturally in these areas, but have been placed in the sediments by man`s activities...|$|R
