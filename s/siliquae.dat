Punjabi Special) at different effluent concentrations. The effluent showed unpleasant odour, acidic pH, high COD and high chlorides. Five concentrations of the distillery effluent (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 %) were used for irrigation of B. napus plants with tap water as control. Various characteristics of <b>siliqua</b> (number of <b>siliqua,</b> average <b>siliqua</b> length, weight of <b>siliqua)</b> and seeds (number of seeds, weight of hundred seeds, economic yield) were quantified to check the variations in the yield attributes of effluent irrigated test plant.

2500|$|The {{cessation}} in {{supply of}} freshly struck coins didn’t necessarily cause an immediate halt {{in the use}} of coinage. [...] Numismatists and archaeologists have long been struck by the phenomenon of clipped <b>siliquae</b> from the early 5th century, though precise dates and explanations for it remain elusive. [...] Clipping may have carried on {{into the middle of the}} 5th century, or been restricted to the 410s and 420s, and was perhaps carried out as a means of taxation by a government deprived of new supplies of coinage. [...] According to this model, <b>siliquae</b> of a specified weight would have been brought in, clipped, and finally reissued by unit rather than weight.|$|E

The finds included a moderately large villa at Chew Park, where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with ink writing were found. There is also evidence from the Pagans Hill Roman Temple at Chew Stoke. In October 2001 the West Bagborough Hoard of 4th-century Roman silver was discovered in West Bagborough. The 681 coins included two denarii from the early 2nd century and 8 miliarensia and 671 <b>siliquae</b> all dating from AD 337 to 367. The majority were struck in the reigns of emperors Constantius II and Julian and derive from a range of mints including Arles and Lyons in France, Trier in Germany, and Rome. In April 2010, the Frome Hoard, one of the largest ever hoards of Roman coins discovered in Britain, was found by a metal detectorist. The hoard of 52,500 coins dated from the 3rd century AD and was found buried in a field near Frome, in a jar [...] below the surface.

40|$|Yield {{improvement}} {{has always}} been an important objective for plant breeders although seed yield is a complex trait influenced by several component characters. The present paper reports the efforts made to develop lines of yellow sarson with some established morpho-phisiological characters contributing to seed yield. A spontaneous erectophyle multilocular <b>siliqua</b> mutant was first used to transfer this trait into improved breeding lines. Both multilocular and bilocular <b>siliqua</b> types were comparable in seed yield but bilocular types recorded significantly higher number of <b>siliqua</b> per plant while tetralocular types recorded significantly larger number of seeds per <b>siliqua.</b> Erectophyle <b>siliqua</b> orientation was then established to be more productive than other posture like pendant or horizontal. A spontaneous basal branching mutant was then used to transfer this trait into the breeding lines and incorporated lines produced more number of <b>siliqua</b> per plant through increase in number of branches. A spontaneous apetalous mutant was isolated and this trait was transferred to the elite breeding lines. Among different groups waxy multilocular apetalous groups recorded significantly higher seed yield per plant. Thus the long term research efforts established the concept of achieving a high yielding ideotype in yellow sarson through incorporation of some morpho-physical traits following classical breeding...|$|R

Constantine's solidus was struck {{at a rate of}} 72 to a Roman pound (of about 326.6 g) of pure gold; each coin weighed 24 Greco-Roman carats(189 mg each), or about 4.5 grams of gold per coin.
