5|$|Warfarin is {{contraindicated}} in pregnancy, as {{it passes}} through the placental barrier and may cause bleeding in the fetus; warfarin use during pregnancy is commonly associated with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion,</b> stillbirth, neonatal death, and preterm birth. Coumarins (such as warfarin) are also teratogens, that is, they cause birth defects; the incidence of birth defects in infants exposed to warfarin in utero appears to be around 5%, although higher figures (up to 30%) {{have been reported in}} some studies. Depending on when exposure occurs during pregnancy, two distinct combinations of congenital abnormalities can arise.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> in {{hospitals}} were analysed from two sources—membership {{files of the}} Union of Rubber and Leather Workers (about 10 000 women) and records of the personnel of a rubber factory (about 1600 women). Two frequencies of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> were calculated for each population analysed: rate (No <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> X 100 /No pregnancies) and ratio (No <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> X 100 /No births). The two frequencies were increased for all union members compared with all Finnish women. The frequencies, however, did not appreciably differ when the pregnancies occurred during union membership {{as compared with the}} pregnancies before or after membership. The frequency of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> was higher for the short-time union members than for those employed for longer periods, but the increased frequency did not correlate with union membership. The employees of a rubber factory had slightly fewer <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> on average than the community population. The women employed in the rubber factory for three to 23 months were found to have appreciably higher frequencies of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> than the women employed for longer periods. The present study showed the feasibility of using cases of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> {{in hospitals}} in an occupational study with longitudinal employment data. Women with short periods of employment appeared to have more <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> than those with longer periods of employment suggesting the presence of selection mechanisms, perhaps with some analogies to the “healthy worker effect” in occupational mortality studies. The presence of such selection mechanisms deserve serious consideration in occupational reproductive epidemiology...|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of 2922 karyotyped <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions,</b> 62 {{were found to be}} {{trisomic}} for chromosome 13, 46 having a simple trisomy and 16 a translocation trisomy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: First {{trimester}} {{pregnancy loss}} {{is a very}} common complication and a matter of concern for couples planning pregnancy. Balanced chromosomal rearrangements in either parent is an important cause of recurrent pregnancy loss particularly in the first trimester. AIMS: In this study {{an evaluation of the}} contribution of chromosomal anomalies in causing repeated <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> was made. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A review of the cytogenetic data in 742 couples (1484 individuals) with recurrent <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> who were examined for chromosomal aberrations in the period 1990 - 2003 is presented. Women who had at least two <b>abortions,</b> or <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> preceded or followed by fetal deaths or birth of a malformed child, and patients who had recurrent <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> (> 3) with normal live issue/s were studied. RESULTS: Chromosomal rearrangements were found in 31 individuals (2 &#x 0025;). These abnormalities included 22 (2. 9 &#x 0025;) structural aberrations, 9 (1. 2 &#x 0025;) numerical anomalies. In addition to these abnormalities, 21 (3. 2 &#x 0025;) chromosomal variants were also found. CONCLUSION: Chromosomal analysis is an important etiological investigation in couples with repeated <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> as it helps in genetic counseling and deciding about further reproductive options...|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} cause of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> during the first {{trimester}} is chromosomal abnormalities of the embryo or fetus, accounting for at least 50% of sampled early pregnancy losses. Other causes include vascular disease (such as lupus), diabetes, other hormonal problems, infection, and abnormalities of the uterus. Advancing maternal age and a woman's history of previous spontaneous abortions are the two leading factors associated with a greater risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> A <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> can also be caused by accidental trauma; intentional trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion or feticide.|$|E

On the other hand, the combination mother B/child AB is rarer than expected, but no increase in the rate of previous <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> is obvious among these women. These discrepancies are interpreted as an indication that prenatal selection associated with ABO incompatibility may operate at various stages from fertilization through pregnancy, and that different incompatible combinations may be subject to selection at different stages...|$|R

40|$|Data on {{the birth}} ranks of miscarriages within sibships in which a case of {{anencephaly}} or spina bifida (ASB) had occurred were analysed by the Haldane-Smith statistical test.

The strongest source of bias in this analysis [...] the fact that mothers tend to forget early <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> [...] worked against this finding, so the negative birth order effect is probably genuine. Because ASB itself shows a negative birth order effect and because <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> in normal sibships do not show such an effect, the additional <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> in ASB sibships are probably of fetuses affected by ASB...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background & Objective To {{assess the}} extent of L. monocytogenes in {{causation}} of human <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> by isolation methods and PCR analysis {{for the presence of}} actA and InlB genes. Methods : In this descriptive study, vaginal swabs were collected from 96 women with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> who referred to Tehran`s hospitals. The samples were cultured in to Listeria specific media (PALCAM agar). Then, the Listeria genus was verified by differentiation  biochemical tests, such as, haemolysis on Blood agar, Catalase and Oxidase reaction, motility at room temperature. PCR test was performed on all samples and detected the actA and InlB genes of L. monocytogenes. Results : In culture, 7 of 96 samples were positive for L. monocytogenes.                                      in PCR technique, actA and InlB genes were detected from 12 and 2 vaginal samples,  respectively. Conclusions : The occurrence of pathogenic L. monocytogenes in cases of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> was 12. 5 %. It seems that the actA and InlB genes have an important roles as essential virulences determinant in pathogenic L. monocytogenes. The results show the PCR method is more sensitive, easier and faster than culture to detect L. monocytogenes.

40|$|The {{value of}} histologic {{evaluation}} of placental tissue in <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> remains undefined. We analyzed 90 placentas from early <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> to ascertain if morphologic features were predictive of karyotype. Normal karyotypes {{were observed in}} 40 cases, and abnormal karyotypes were found in 50. There were 25 trisomies, 6 triploidies, 2 tetraploidies, one 45, &times; 0, and 16 other abnormalities, such as mosaic and chimera. All 6 triploid placentas were partial moles. The pres-ence of intravillous cistern formation and focal trophoblastic hyperplasia was seen more frequently in cases with abnormal karyotypes. The triploid cases, however, contributed {{the majority of cases}} with these villous changes. Hydropic abortion was observed approximately equally in both chromosomally normal and abnormal cases, and its incidence was high in cases of trisomy 16 and tetraploid placenta. Mild edema and regressive changes, such as stromal fibrosis, hypovascular stroma, and attenuated trophoblastic layers, were often found and none showed any specific chromosomal abnormalities. These results indicate that histology can provide only a suggestion as to the likelihood of triploidy and that histologic examination of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> is not useful as a method for predicting chromosomal abnor-mality.
