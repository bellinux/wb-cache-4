40|$|Two-dimensional (2 D) layered {{transition}} metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been recently proposed as appealing candidate materials for spintronic applications owing to their distinctive atomic crystal structure and exotic physical properties {{arising from the}} large bonding anisotropy. Here we introduce the first MoS 2 -based spin-valves that employ monolayer MoS 2 as the nonmagnetic spacer. In contrast with what expected from the semiconducting band-structure of MoS 2, the vertically sandwiched-MoS 2 layers exhibit metallic behavior. This originates from their strong hybridization with the Ni and Fe atoms of the Permalloy (Py) electrode. The spin-valve effect is observed up to 240 K, with the highest magnetoresistance (MR) up to 0. 73 % at low temperatures. The experimental work is accompanied by the first principle electron transport calculations, which reveal an MR of ~ 9 % for an ideal Py/MoS 2 /Py junction. Our results clearly identify TMDs as a promising <b>spacer</b> <b>compound</b> in magnetic tunnel junctions and may open {{a new avenue for}} the TMDs-based spintronic applications...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 120 - 125). Many antimalarial drugs including chloroquine are {{no longer}} effective against the disease, as their efficacy has been decreased by the spread of drug resistant strains. This loss {{has been a major}} barrier to the effective treatment of malaria and has necessitated an urgent need to discover new antimalarial drugs. New 4 -aminoquinoline isatin derivatives have been designed and synthesised. Isatin was used as a biologically validated starting point for the design of chemical libraries directed at the intended target due to its privileged nature. Included in the design of these isatin derivatives is the thiosemicarbazone moiety previously demonstrated to inhibit cysteine proteases from mUltiple protozoan parasites. Synthesized compounds were tested against the enzyme falcipain- 2 (Rec-FP- 2) as well as the parasite source of this protease, Plasmodium Jalciparum (P. f. W 2). The results of structure activity relationship studies demonstrate the influence of substituents at position 5 of the isatin scaffold. With respect to the chain length, a two carbon methylene spacer between the aminoquinoline and isatin moieties, was found optimum. A 5 -bromo isatin derivative with this <b>spacer,</b> <b>compound</b> 79 b, was found to be the most active with an IC₅₀ value of 163. 5 nM against the W 2 parasite strain and second most active against the enzyme (lC₅₀ = 3. 65 μM) ...|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to tuning the nonlinear optical properties of hybrid oligo(triacetylene) compounds is studied. The method {{is based on the}} insertion of a central heterospacer group between two (E) -hex- 3 -ene- 1, 5 -diyne moieties. A significant increase in the second hyperpolarizability g is expected if the central spacer fragment is an extended conjugated chromophore. We present a series of molecules with enhanced second hyperpolarizability caused by the presence of highly conjugated spacer groups, which increase the overall p-electron delocalization. Some metal complexes obtained from the coordination of these hybrid oligomers to transitionmetal centers have also been investigated and revealed substantial differences in the capacities of the metal centers to act as electronic bridges. Finally, we show that theoretical predictions of the relative differences in the second hyperpolarizabilities of the new <b>spacer</b> <b>compounds</b> are in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

Such compounds were tested against a panel of PRMTs (RmtA, PRMT 1, and CARM 1) and against human SET 7 (a HKMT), using histone and non-histone proteins as a substrate. They were also screened against HAT and SIRTs, because they are structurally related to some HAT and/or SIRT modulators. From the inhibitory data, some of tested compounds (1 b, 1 c, 4 b, 4 f, 4 j, 4 l, 7 b, and 7 f) were able to inhibit PRMTs, HKMT, HAT, and SIRTs with similar potency, thus behaving as multiple ligands for these epigenetic targets (epi-MLs). When tested on the human leukemia U 937 cell line, the epi-MLs induced high apoptosis levels [i. e., 40. 7 % (4 l) and 42. 6 % (7 b) ] and/or massive, dose-dependent cytodifferentiation [i. e., 95. 2 % (1 c) and 96. 1 % (4 j) ], whereas the single-target inhibitors eosin, curcumin, and sirtinol were ineffective or showed a weak effec...|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of sample components whose pI values {{are outside the}} pH gradient established by 101 hypothetical biprotic carrier ampholytes covering a pH 6 - 8 range was investigated by computer simulation under constant current conditions with concomitant constant electroosmosis toward the cathode. Data obtained with the sample being applied between zones of carrier ampholytes and on the anodic side of the carrier ampholytes were studied and found to evolve into zone structures comprising three regions between anolyte and catholyte. The focusing region with the pH gradient is bracketed by two isotachopheretic zone structures comprising selected sample and carrier components as isotachophoretic zones. The isotachophoretic structures electrophoretically migrate in opposite direction and their lengths increase with time due to the gradual isotachophoretic decay at the pH gradient edges. Due to electroosmosis, however, the overall pattern is being transported toward the cathode. Sample components whose pI values are outside the established pH gradient are demonstrated to form isotachophoretic zones behind the leading cation of the catholyte (components with pI values larger than 8) and the leading anion of the anolyte (components with pI values smaller than 6). Amphoteric compounds with appropriate pI values or nonamphoteric components can act as isotachophoretic <b>spacer</b> <b>compounds</b> between sample compounds or between the leader and the sample with the highest mobility.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the screening of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) based on cellular potency using the murine multiple myeloma 5 T 33 MM model. METHODS: The cellular potencies of 10 structurally related compounds {{of the natural}} HDACi Trichostatin (TSA) were screened by measuring the DNA synthesis in primary murine 5 T 33 MMvv cells. The anti-tumor activity of the three most potent analogues was further confirmed in the 5 T 33 MMvt cell line using proliferation, viability and active caspase- 3 assays. The data of this 5 T 33 MM model were compared with the HDAC IC 50 of these compounds which were preliminarily determined in normal hepatocyte extract. RESULTS: The TSA analogues with a tetranoic <b>spacer</b> (<b>compounds</b> 7 - 10) had no sig-nificant effect on the DNA synthesis of 5 T 33 MM cells, whereas the three most potent analogues (compounds 1, 3 and 4), having a pentanoic spacer, significantly reduced the DNA synthesis and the viability. We further observed a significant increase of active caspase- 3 in the 5 T 33 MM cells when treated with compound 3 or 4, reflecting their apoptosis-inducing capability. When comparing with the HDAC-inhibitory activiti-es of these compounds in normal hepatocyte extract, a similar result was obtained to suggest that compound 4 had the most potent anti-cancer activity. CONCLUSION: Screening the cellular potency of TSA analogues using the 5 T 33 MM model is a reliable and efficient system to select the most potent analogue early {{in the development of}} HDACi and proves the value of this model for evaluation of HDACi...|$|R

PQ-CAD amides 3 a–k were prepared by a simple one-step condensation reaction of PQ with a series of CAD chlorides (method A) or benzotriazolides 2 (method B). The synthesis of acylsemicarbazides 7 a–k included activation of PQ with benzotriazole, preparation of PQ-semicarbazide 6 and its condensation with CAD chlorides 4. All synthesized PQ-CAD conjugates were evaluated for their anticancer, antiviral and antioxidative activities. Almost all compounds from series 3 were selective towards the MCF- 7 cell line and active at micromolar concentrations. The o-fluoro derivative 3 h showed high activity against HeLa, MCF- 7 and in particular against the SW 620 cell line, while acylsemicarbazide 7 f with a benzodioxole ring and 7 c, 7 g and especially 7 j with methoxy-, chloro- or trifluoromethyl-substituents in the para position showed high selectivity and high inhibitory activity against MCF- 7 cell line at micromolar (7 c, 7 f, 7 g) and nanomolar (7 j) levels.

40|$|Chapter 1 : Peptide {{targeting}} of integrin αvβ 3 Integrins are cellular surface receptor proteins involved in numerous cellular signalling and adhesion processes. The integrin αvβ 3 subtype is up-regulated around sites of malignancy especially solid tumour masses. This {{is due to}} its expression on the endothelial and smooth muscle cells which are concentrated in areas of cancer where the uncontrolled proliferation and longeitivity of cells characterises the malignant process. Sustaining such a process is achieved {{through the development of}} a labyrinth of new vessels to supply nutrients and remove waste from the accumulating tumour mass. This is the process of angiogenesis, where endothelial and smooth muscle cells accumulate to form new blood vessels. Crystallographic studies have determined that the tri-amino acid sequence RGD is crucial for the recognition and binding of extracellular proteins in the αvβ 3 integrin binding site. Cyclic penta-peptides bearing this RGD motif have been found to exhibit preferential in vivo stability properties over their linear counterparts without affecting recognition and binding. In this study the cyclic peptide cRGDfK was synthesised using solid phase peptide chemistry and the lysine (K) residue proved an efficient means of attaching a fluorophore for potential diagnostic imaging applications. Targeted fluorescent imaging is the backbone of this study. Novel lanthanide metal complexes with a variety of appended chromophores were synthesised via the Ugi four-component condensation reaction. The plan was to discern the most effective energy transfer mediated long-lifetime luminescent combinations, for subsequent attachment to the cyclic peptide as long-lifetime imaging agents which would allow the use of time-gated technology to eliminate troublesome background fluorescence. This chemistry was published. Near-IR emissive organic fluorophores were also appended to the cyclic peptide and intraveneously injected into live lung tumour bearing mice. This interesting work investigated the in vivo potential of these targeted probes. Chapter 2 : β-Galactoside {{targeting of}} galectin- 3 Galectins are a family of intra and extra-cellular proteins which bind specifically to the β-galactoside carbohydrate residues of cellular glycoproteins. Several galectins, but most significantly galectin- 3, have been found to mediate important inter- and intra-cellular processes particular to cancer cells including their signalling, proliferation and also in the metastasis of malignancy. Galectin- 3 targeted lactosamine derivatives were synthesised with various organic fluorophores appended via an N-caproic <b>spacer</b> unit. These <b>compounds</b> were then tested against galectin- 3 expressing cell lines and the binding and subsequent emission visualised through fluorescence microscopy.

40|$|Tamoxifen (TAM) {{is widely}} used in the {{treatment}} of hormone dependent breast cancer. TAM itself acts as prodrug, which is activated by hydroxylation of the 4 -position of the A-ring. The resulting 4 -hydroxytamoxifen (4 -OHT) possesses an 8 times higher binding affinity to the estrogen receptor (ER) and acts as pure anti-estrogen in hormone dependent tumor cells. The dimethylaminoethoxy side chain in 4 -position of the B-ring seems to be crucial for the anti-estrogenic activity. As it could be previously shown a series of O-acyl triarylalkene derivatives possessed weak but significant antagonistic effects, without bearing a basic side chain. Therefore in this work the necessicity of a basic side chain for the antagonistic effects of triarylalkenes was examined on molecular level. According to this 1, 1 -Bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 2 -phenylalkenes (BisOHR), 1, 1, 2 -Tris(4 -hydroxyphenyl) alkenes (TrisOHR), 1 -(3 -Fluor- 4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 1, 2 -bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) alkenes (FTrisOHR) and the corresponding O-methylethers with different C 2 -alkyl side chains were synthesized. Additionally BisOHPr and TrisOHPr derivatives with different functional groups at the alkyl side chain were synthesized. Receptor binding affinity, agonistic and antagonistic properties on the MCF- 7 - 2 a hormone dependent breast cancer cell line and the cytotoxic properties were examined. Receptor binding affinity and antagonistic properties were influenced by the length and the functional groups {{at the end of the}} side chain at C 2. The most active compounds BisOHEt, TrisOHEt and FTrisOHBu possessed similar antagonistic properties on molecular level as 4 -OHT. These strong antagonistic effects cannot be mediated by the mode of action that is known for 4 -OHT, as the examined compounds do not bear a basic side chain. It might rather be assumed that the antagonistic properties are exerted by a mode of action termed &rdquo passive &rdquo antagonism which was proposed recently for a tetrahydrochrysene derivative. The cytotoxic properties could not be correlated with the length of the C 2 -alkyl side chain. The most active compounds were the O-methylated amines BisOMePrNH 2 and TrisOMePrNH 2 which showed even cytocidal effects on MCF- 7 cells. Furthermore investigations on the fluorescence labelling of ER-ligands were carried out. To achieve this goal conjugation of a triarylalkene with a fluorescent probe seemed the most suitable method. Two positions of the triarylalkene scaffold were chosen for conjugation by overlay with E 2. Regarding an application of the conjugates in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy the triarylalkenes were connected with rhodamine b by means of a hexyl <b>spacer.</b> The resulting <b>compounds</b> 27 and 33 Z still require optimisation according to ER-affinity and fluorescence characteristics in view of their future application...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} forty years, {{inorganic}} silicon and gallium arsenide semiconductors, silicon dioxide insulators, and metals such as aluminium and copper {{have been the}} backbone of the semiconductor industry. However, there has been a growing research effort in "organic electronic" to improve the semiconducting, conducting and light emitting properties of organics (polymers, oligomers) and hybrids (organic-inorganic composites) through the novel synthesis and self-assembly techniques. This rich area of research has been benefited from studies on rational design based on crystal engineering, including supramolecular chemistry, and the interest to investigate the structures and properties of organic solids states. This research work was carried out to understand the intermolecular interactions and molecular recognition of solid state structures that might exhibit interesting electrical, magnetic and optical properties. For this purpose, molecules possessing pyridyl groups at the terminal positions have attracted much attention, and their derivatives have been reported by several groups since these molecules can afford supramolecular wires by coordination with metals and/or hydrogen bonding involving the nitrogen atoms of the pyridyl groups. In this context, linear π-conjugated molecules have now been synthesized by inserting benzothiadiazole as spacer units between the dipyridyl backbone. The introducing of 1, 2, 5 -thiadiazole rings is of interest due to their extended m-conjugation and polarized heteroatoms which are expected to afford well-ordered crystal structures leading to intermolecular interactions such as heteroatom contacts or π [...] . π interactions. The compounds containing thiadiazole rings are well known as strong fluorescent materials. Highly fluorescent π-conjugated molecules are of interest from the application purposes such as EL (electrioluminescence) devices and single molecular detection. Moreover, this heterocycle is electron-withdrawing and the compounds bearing this ring arc possible candidates for electron carriers. The electron accepting conjugated molecules are also of interest from view points of the NDR (negative differential resistance) behaviors since recent studies have shown that oligo (phenyleneethylene) s containing an electron-withdrawing nitro group can be used as active redox centers responsible for the NDR behavior in semiconductor devices. In this research work, the author designed some new dipyridyl compounds and their viologen analogues containing benzothiadiazole spacer units as shown in general scheme l and investigated their electronic properties, crystal structures, and established the relationship between the structures and fluorescence properties. The compounds of 4, 7 -di(n-pyridyl) - 1, 2, 3 -benzothiadiazole (n = 2, 3, and 4) (1 a-c) show high quantum yields of fluorescence and high electron affinities. They also show solid-state fluorescence due to weak intermolecular interactions caused by their large torsion angle between the benzothiadiazole and pyridyl rings. There is no significant effect of the nitrogen positions of the pyridyl rings on the quantum yield of fluorescence. The crystal structures of the compounds 1 a-c have the similar space group with overlapping the stacked molecules in a head-to-tail fashion. The reduction potentials of their viologen analogues 2 - 3 are higher than their corresponding neutral compounds. The quantum yields of fluorescence of these compounds are low due to decrease of the torsion angles. The compounds 4, 7 -bis (n-pyridylethynyl) - 1, 2, 3 -benzothiadiazole (n = 2, 3, and 4) (4 a-c) also show high electron affinities and high quantum yields of fluorescence. The absolute quantum yield of 4 c is 0. 87 ± 0. 05. The solids-state fluorescence of these compounds is lower compared to the compounds 1 a-c. This {{can be explained by the}} planarity of the molecular structures. X-ray structures analysis revealed that the torsion angles between the benzothiadiazole and pyridine ring are smaller than those of the compounds 1 a-c. So the intermolecular interactions becomes stronger and the solid-state fluorescence decreases. The molecules are stacked to afford unusual two-dimensional columns where the distance between the molecular planes is 3. 79 Å. The columns run in two directions with 45 °. No short heteroatom contacts such as S [...] . N are observed. The crystal structures of 4 a-c are similar although the space groups are different. The noncentrosymmetric space group is interesting from the standpoint of nonlinear optical properties. The molecular structures of their methylated compounds are more planar than the corresponding neutral compounds. Their crystal structures include π [...] . π staking of long molecules. A number of intermolecular O-H [...] . O C-H [...] . O and C-H [...] . F interactions are also found in the methylated structures. The absorption maxima of bis (benzothiadiazole) compounds (8 - 11) are observed at longer wavelengths than those of mono(benzothiadiazole) compounds due to longer conjugation in these compounds. The quantum yields are a little decreased compared to the mono(benzothiadiazole) compounds. There is no significant effect of the nitrogen positions on the absorption and emission spectra on these compounds. The reduction potentials of these compounds show stepwise one-electron reduction waves due to the presence of two benzothiadiazole ring, and also higher than those of mono benzothiadiazole derivatives. This is attributed to the electron withdrawing property of the thiadiazole ring. X-ray structure analysis reveals that the bis(benzothidiazole) derivatives are nonplanar structures due to the repulsion between the pyridine and benzothidiazole ring. There are short S-N contacts observed, leading to the molecular tape structures. It is noteworthy that the dihedral angles of their methylated compounds are drastically decreased, and the dihedral angle between the pyridine and benzothidiazole ring is absolutely zero degree in the methylated compound 11 c. Finally, the author used dipyridyl compounds containing π-conjugated groups as proton acceptor as shown in general Scheme 2, and investigated their complexation with chloranilic(CLA) and squaric (SQA) acid by hydrogen-bonding interactions which are very important in the field of crystal engineering as well as in supramolecular chemistry. The introduction of a π-conjugated <b>spacer</b> to dipyridyl <b>compounds</b> have been considered to increase intermolecular π-π interactions and decrease Coulombs repulsion in the dication states. The crystal structures are strongly dependent on the spacer group. Although the details of relationship between the crystal structures and spacer group are still ambiguous, it should be noted that the structure of the complexes of the twisted molecules are completely different from those of the planar molecules. The author believed that more elaborated crystal engineering would be possible by changing the spacer group and/or substituents of anilic acid...|$|R
