50|$|In {{addition}} to firing very quickly when properly activated, EBW detonators are safe from stray <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> other electric current. Enough current and the bridgewire may melt, {{but it is}} small enough that it cannot detonate the initiator explosive unless the full, high voltage high current charge passes through the bridgewire. EBW detonators are used in many civilian applications where radio signals, <b>static</b> <b>electricity,</b> or other electrical hazards might cause accidents with conventional electric detonators.|$|R

25|$|<b>Static</b> <b>{{electric}}ity</b> <b>and</b> {{electric current}} are two separate phenomena. They both involve electric charge, and may occur simultaneously {{in the same}} object. <b>Static</b> <b>electricity</b> refers to the electric charge of an object and the related electrostatic discharge when two objects are brought together that are not at equilibrium. An electrostatic discharge creates {{a change in the}} charge of each of the two objects. In contrast, electric current is the flow of electric charge through an object, which produces no net loss or gain of electric charge.|$|R
25|$|In power {{transmission}} systems, {{one side of}} the circuit, known as the neutral, is grounded to dissipate <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> to reduce hazardous voltages caused by insulation failure and other electrical faults. It is possible to get a shock by only touching the hot wire, due to the person's body being capacitively coupled to the ground upon which the person stands, even if the person is standing on an insulated surface.|$|R

2500|$|By the mid-18th century, French chemist Charles François de Cisternay Du Fay had {{discovered}} {{two forms of}} <b>static</b> <b>electricity,</b> <b>and</b> that like charges repel each other while unlike charges attract. Du Fay announced that electricity consisted of two fluids: vitreous (from the Latin for [...] "glass"), or positive, electricity; and resinous, or negative, electricity. This was the [...] "two-fluid theory" [...] of electricity, which was opposed by Benjamin Franklin's [...] "one-fluid theory" [...] later in the century.|$|R
50|$|Archival quality plastic {{enclosures}} {{are made}} of uncoated polyester, polypropylene, or polyethylene. The transparent quality of plastic lends itself to easier access to the image {{because there is no}} extra step to remove the photograph. Plastic is also less resistant to tears in comparison to paper. Some disadvantages include being prone to <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> a risk of ferrotyping (the act of moisture becoming trapped between the enclosure and item, causing the materials to stick to one another).|$|R

5000|$|Dust Bunnies (or dustbunnies) {{are small}} clumps of dust that form under {{furniture}} and in corners {{that are not}} cleaned regularly. They are made of hair, lint, dead skin, spider webs, dust, and sometimes light rubbish and debris, and are held together by <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> felt-like entanglement. [...] They can house dust mites or other parasites, and can lower the efficiency of dust filters by clogging. The movement of a single large particle can start {{the formation of a}} dust bunny.|$|R
5|$|To avoid a {{potentially}} vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal {{is kept in}} an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, <b>static</b> <b>electricity,</b> <b>and</b> exposure to oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Anything that may contact with barium should be electrically grounded. Anyone who works with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, goggles, and a gas mask. Smoking in the working area is forbidden. Thorough washing is required after handling barium.|$|R

50|$|The Subject then sends {{an email}} {{complaining}} about Praemus. He complains that the unit {{claims he was}} online for 200 hours in a week, and other various problems with his computer, such as his monitor vibrating, blasts of <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> his screen shutting down, meaning he has to send his email from an internet cafe. The Subject gets an email back {{saying that this is}} the first time the Praemus system has done this, and that he should try turning the computer off and on again. However, unknown to him, there is no one working in the Praemus office.|$|R
50|$|After the Crimea, Crompton {{returned}} to Britain {{and went to}} Harrow School. He eschewed the school's highly classical education, decided to study extra mathematics. He built his own <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> generator <b>and</b> performed experiments with Leyden Jars. During a summer holiday, he designed and built a road-going steam tractor called Bluebell.|$|R
50|$|Electroscopes detect {{electric}} charge by {{the motion of}} a test object due to the Coulomb electrostatic force. Since the electric potential or voltage of an object with respect to ground equals its charge divided by its capacitance to ground, an electroscope {{can be regarded as}} a crude voltmeter. However, the accumulation of enough charge to detect with an electroscope requires hundreds or thousands of volts, so electroscopes are only used with high-voltage sources such as <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> electrostatic machines. Electroscopes generally give only a rough, qualitative indication of the magnitude of the charge. An instrument that measures charge quantitatively is called an electrometer.|$|R

This study used a classroom action research approach implementing two cycles. Every cycle consisted of planning, action, observation and reflection.

50|$|The {{most common}} product is 3 mm outer {{diameter}} and 1 mm inner diameter, {{with a tiny}} dusting of HMX/aluminum explosive powder on the tubing's inner surface, which detonates down the tube at a speed greater than 6500 feet per second but does not burst the tube. Being non-electrical and non-metallic, shock tubes are less sensitive to <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> radio frequency energy and thus have replaced many uses of electric detonators and are safer to handle and store than detonating cord. A version containing an explosive gas mixture has the additional advantage of being entirely inert until the tubing is charged with the gas.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is never}} {{explained}} why female Moonbase personnel uniformly wore mauve or purple wigs, silver catsuits, and extensive eye make-up (although {{it has been}} suggested in the novelisation of the show that it was to combat <b>static</b> <b>electricity)</b> <b>and</b> their unusual apparel is never discussed in the series. Gerry Anderson has commented that it made them look more futuristic and that it filmed better under the bright lights, while Sylvia Anderson said she believed wigs would become accepted components of military uniforms by the 1980s. But whenever female Moonbase personnel visited Earth (as Ellis and Barry did from time to time), their lunar uniforms and wigs were never worn.|$|R
5000|$|Since it {{is able to}} {{distinguish}} between charged and non-charged objects, it {{is an example of a}} class of devices known as electroscopes. The versorium is of a similar construction to the magnetic compass, but is influenced by electrostatic rather than magnetic forces. At the time it was invented, the differences between magnetic and electrical forces were poorly understood and Gilbert did a series of experiments to prove they were two separate types of forces with the versorium and another device called a Terrella (or [...] "little Earth"). In fact, Gilbert was the first to draw a clear distinction between magnetism <b>and</b> <b>static</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> is credited with establishing the term electricity.|$|R
