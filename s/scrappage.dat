In contrast, the U.S. market share was 2.8% for the same year. These record sales allowed Japan to surpass the U.S. in total new hybrid sales, with the Japanese market representing almost half (48%) of the worldwide hybrid sales in 2009 while the U.S. market represented 42% of global sales.

5000|$|<b>Scrappage</b> {{programs}} were touted with different names, mostly referring to an environmental benefit. The Vehicle Efficiency Incentive in Canada {{was based on}} fuel-efficiency of cars. In Germany the economic stimulus program was called [...] "Umweltprämie" [...] (environmental premium) and in Austria [...] "Ökoprämie" [...] (eco-premium) {{while most of the}} public referred to it simply as [...] "Abwrackprämie" [...] (<b>scrappage</b> premium). Other countries have not tried to connect the program title with an environment aspect - still the Italian [...] "Incentivi alla rottamazione" [...] (<b>scrappage</b> incentives) and French [...] "Prime à la casse" [...] (<b>scrappage</b> premium) require the new car to meet modern emission standards. The German <b>scrappage</b> incentive scheme and the British <b>scrappage</b> scheme do not have such requirements, and the UK scheme was openly sketched on the target to provide financial support to the motor industry. Similarly, the United States Congress devised a <b>scrappage</b> scheme, commonly referred to as [...] "cash for clunkers," [...] as part of a general Automotive Stimulus package series; however, the voucher is only given when the newer car has a better fuel efficiency than the old car.|$|E
50|$|A <b>scrappage</b> {{program is}} a {{government}} budget program to promote the replacement of old vehicles with modern vehicles. <b>Scrappage</b> programs generally have the dual aim of stimulating the automobile industry and removing inefficient, high emissions vehicles from the road. Many European countries have introduced large-scale <b>scrappage</b> programs as an economic stimulus to increase market demand in the industrial sector during the global recession that began in 2008.|$|E

50|$|The UK Vehicle <b>scrappage</b> scheme (also Vehicle {{discount}} {{scheme and}} Car <b>Scrappage</b> Scheme) is a vehicle <b>scrappage</b> scheme that {{was introduced in}} the 2009 United Kingdom Budget to encourage UK citizens to purchase a new car or van and scrap an old one that they have owned for more than 12 months. The scheme was extended in September 2009 and again in February 2010 and it finished at the end of March 2010. In February 2010 a separate Plug-in Car Grant to provide £5,000 towards the cost of electric vehicles was announced and it began in January 2011.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{automakers}} {{say that}} the federal government is not doing enough with the <b>scrappage</b> program and contrasted it with the American Car Allowance Rebate System, where people who bring in a vehicle less than 25 years old may receive US$3,500 to US$4,500 towards a new vehicle. For example, the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, which represents General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, says a stronger <b>scrappage</b> program would have provide a better boost to the economy while taking polluting vehicles off the road. As a result, some automakers have created their own programs on top of the federal <b>scrappage</b> program that increase cash incentives in hopes of increasing vehicle sales.|$|E

50|$|In Italy {{there was}} <b>scrappage</b> scheme from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2008, that allowed for €700 plus a tax rebate. A new <b>scrappage</b> scheme {{is in place}} in 2009. New cars must comply at minimum with Euro 4 + emit a maximum of 130 g/km (diesel) or 140 g/km (other fuels) of CO2.Scrapping {{incentive}} for cars is €1,500 but can be combined with purchase incentive of €1,500 for a new car running on CNG, electricity or hydrogen (increased to €3,000 if it emits exactly 120 g/km and to €3,500 if it emits less than 120 g/km) The purchase incentive for new car running on LPG is €1,500, increased to €2,000 if the car emits less than 120 g/km. This can also be combined with the scrapping incentive. <b>Scrappage</b> program ended in December 2009 with delivery of vehicle by March 2010.|$|E
50|$|The <b>scrappage</b> {{scheme of}} Germany {{has been the}} largest so far. Every owner of a car being older than 9 years was {{entitled}} for a <b>scrappage</b> premium of €2,500 ($3,320) when buying a new car. When introduced on 13 January 2009, the program was limited to at most 600,000 cars and a budget of €1.5b. However the car market boomed with an unexpected increase of 40% (March 2009 compared to March 2008) in sales making the program too short running to offer more than a short termed stimulus - estimates showed that the program fund would be used up by May. On March 25, 2009, the government decided to continue the <b>scrappage</b> scheme {{at least until the}} end of year. A German think tank estimated that the net impact of the program on the German budget will be €2.5b ($3.5b).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>scrappage</b> {{scheme of}} France was {{introduced}} on January 19, 2009 - the old car {{would need to}} be older than 10 years and the new car would have needed to meet a particular CO2 emission standard - it started with €1000 for a car with less than 160 g/km. This was added up for even better emission standards (€5000 for cars with less than 60 g/km - effectively one electric vehicles) and a [...] "super-bonus" [...] for the <b>scrappage</b> of the old car.|$|E
50|$|In Slovakia a <b>scrappage</b> {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} {{that allows for}} €2,000 (originally €2,500) if the old car was older than 10 years and the new car was below €25,000.|$|E
