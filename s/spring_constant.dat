40|$|Funding: University of St Andrews. A {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} calibration of the <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> of all flexural modes of microcantilevers is presented. It {{is based on}} a flow of gas from a microchannel that interacts with the microcantilever. The gas flow causes a measurable shift in the resonance frequencies of thermal noise spectra of the flexural modes. From the magnitude of the frequency shifts of the individual modes the <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> can be determined with high accuracy and precision. The method is non-invasive and does not risk damage to the cantilever.

25|$|The basic physics behind {{neutrino}} oscillation can {{be found}} in any system of coupled harmonic oscillators. A simple example is a system of two pendulums connected by a weak spring (a spring with a small <b>spring</b> <b>constant).</b> The first pendulum is set in motion by the experimenter while the second begins at rest. Over time, the second pendulum begins to swing {{under the influence of the}} spring, while the first pendulum's amplitude decreases as it loses energy to the second. Eventually all of the system's energy is transferred to the second pendulum and the first is at rest. The process then reverses. The energy oscillates between the two pendulums repeatedly until it is lost to friction.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe single-parameter Γ {{matrix of}} force {{constants}} {{proposed by the}} Gaussian Network Model (GNM) is iteratively modified to yield native state fluctuations that agree exactly with experimentally observed values. The resulting optimized Γ matrix contains residue-specific force constants {{that may be used}} for an accurate analysis of ligand binding to single or multiple sites on proteins. Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI) is used as an example. The calculated off-diagonal elements of the Γ matrix, i. e., the optimized <b>spring</b> <b>constants,</b> obey a Lorentzian distribution. The mean value of the <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> is ∼− 0. 1, a value much weaker than − 1 of the GNM. Few of the <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> are positive, indicating repulsion between residues. Residue pairs with large number of neighbors have <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> around the mean, − 0. 1. Large negative <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> are between highly correlated pairs of residues. The fluctuations of the distance between anticorrelated pairs of residues are subject to smaller <b>spring</b> <b>constants.</b> The importance of the number of neighbors of residue pairs in determining the elements of the Γ matrix is pointed out. Allosteric effects of binding on a single or multiple residues of BPTI are illustrated and discussed. Comparison of the predictions of the present model with those of the standard GNM shows that the two models agree at lower modes, i. e., those relating to global motions, but they disagree at higher modes. In the higher modes, the present model points to the important contributions from specific residues whereas the standard GNM fails to do so...|$|R
40|$|Influence of {{the joint}} springs and the initial {{conditions}} on the locomotion of the bipedal model has been investigated. The bipedal model, as proposed before, has eight rigid links representing upper and lower legs, feet, the waist, and the upper body, which are jointed each other by pins together with tensional springs. As reported previously, in the monopedal period, a limited range of <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> are available for the model to move continuously alike human walking. However, {{it has been found}} that these same values of <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> are not appropriate for the bipedal period.

40|$|Bacteria {{adhering}} to surfaces demonstrate random, nanoscopic vibrations around their equilibrium positions. This paper compares vibrational amplitudes of bacteria {{adhering to}} glass. <b>Spring</b> <b>constants</b> {{of the bond}} are derived from vibrational amplitudes and related to the electrophoretic softness of the cell surfaces and dissipation shifts measured upon bacterial adhesion in a quartz-crystal-microbalance (QCM-D). Experiments were conducted with six bacterial strains with pairwise differences in cell surface characteristics. Vibrational amplitudes were highest in low ionic strength suspensions. Under fluid flow, vibrational amplitudes were lower {{in the direction of}} flow than perpendicular to it because stretching of cell surface polymers in the direction of flow causes stiffening of the polyelectrolyte network surrounding a bacterium. Under static conditions (0. 57 mM), vibrational amplitudes of fibrillated Streptococcus salivarius HB 7 (145 nm) were higher than that of a bald mutant HB-C 12 (76 nm). Amplitudes of moderately extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) producing Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35983 (47 nm) were more than twice the amplitudes of strongly EPS producing S. epidermidis ATCC 35984 (21 nm). No differences were found between Staphylococcus aureus strains differing in membrane cross-linking. High vibrational amplitudes corresponded with low dissipation shifts in QCM-D.

A method {{suitable}} for the calibration of the <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> of all torsional and lateral eigenmodes of micro- and nanocantilever sensors is described. Such sensors enable nanomechanical measurements and the characterization of nanomaterials, for example with atomic force microscopy. The method presented involves the interaction of a flow of fluid from a microchannel with the cantilever beam. Forces imparted by the flow cause the cantilever to bend and induce a measurable change of the torsional and lateral resonance frequencies. From the frequency shifts the cantilever <b>spring</b> <b>constants</b> can be determined. The method does not involve physical contact between the cantilever or its tip and a hard surface. As such it is non-invasive and does not risk damage to the cantilever.
