After {{designing}} a scissor platform which main {{function is to}} standunderload, according to the load that the platform may bear, a finite element model is established, the ANSYS software is used to analysis the load on the <b>scissor</b> <b>arm</b> and mobile platform whole. The result show that the mobile platform could {{meet the requirements of}} bearing load. The maximum mises stress is taken as the objective function, the structure optimization is used on the <b>scissor</b> <b>arm,</b> so stress distribution more uniform. The work done in this article made theory basis for research and making the scissor prototype...|$|E

50|$|The {{long drive}} shaft {{ran along the}} full length of the port beam of the lifting frame. It entered a worm gear at the pivot clamp, then {{continued}} to the nose clamp where it entered another worm gear. A shift lever at the nose clamp disengaged the drive shaft to allow either simultaneous or independent operation of the two worm gears. The worm gear at the pivot clamp operated a pair of <b>scissor</b> <b>arms,</b> one {{on each side of the}} lifting frame to insert or extract the trunnion pins from the rocket. The worm gear at the nose clamp operated the jaws of the nose clamp to either open or close, thus enclosing or releasing the rocket.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf [41]) This thesis {{describes a}} novel interactive procedure for designing a scissor lift {{with a computer}} program. An optimization scheme and stress analysis are incorporated. The program determines the optimum cylinder location of a scissor lift, performs stress analysis by using the finite element method, and computes the proper cross-section sizes of the <b>scissor</b> <b>arms</b> for specified design requirements. Modeling techniques and boundary conditions of the design program are discussed. Several illustrative examples are given to demonstrate how the special-purpose code can automate an originally tedious design process, output more accurate results, and reduce design calculation time from about 8 hours for the conventional design to about 30 minutes with the new procedure.

Two forms of robot models were prepared: fix standing type landers, named Hunveyor (Hungarian UNiversity SURVEYOR) and moving robotic rovers, named Husar (Hungarian University Surface Analyser Rover) at Eötvös University, Budapest, Pécs University, Pécs, and Óbuda University, Alba Regia Center, Székesfehérvár. We report some basic instrumentations: a) minimal space probe energetics and electronic system, b) some basic instrumental assemblage (spectrometer, thermometer, Nürnbergian <b>scissor</b> type <b>arm</b> and the cameras), c) rover units, c) test-fields and testing experiments for soil strength analysis...|$|R

Z is the moment where one swoons, drawn into the grips of a presence, as familiar as it is unexplained. The project analyses spaces, objects, and situations where Z threatens to exist. The project searches for Z in the way one may follow a sound, not knowing what it is, searching for its source. The project uses alleged recordings of Z as the conceptual basis of a sculptural practice involving the making of objects and spaces...|$|R

50|$|Sir John Arthur Trudgen {{picked up}} the {{hand-over}} stroke from South American natives he observed swimming {{on a trip to}} Buenos Aires. On his return to England in 1868, he successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873 and won a local competition in 1875. Although the new stroke was really the reintroduction of a more intuitive method for swimming, one that had been in evidence in ancient cultures such as Ancient Assyria, his method revolutionized the state of competitive swimming - his stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today. In his stroke, the arms were brought forward, alternating, while the body rolled from side to side. The kick was a scissors kick such as that familiarly used in breaststroke, with one kick for two arm strokes, although it is believed that the Native Americans had indeed used a flutter kick. Front crawl variants used different ratios of <b>scissor</b> kicks to <b>arm</b> strokes, or alternated with a flutter (up-and-down) kick. The speed of the new stroke was demonstrated by F.V.C. Lane in 1901, swimming 100 yd in 1:00.0, an improvement of about ten seconds compared to the breaststroke record. Due to its speed the Trudgen became very quickly popular around the world, despite all the ungentle-manlike splashing.|$|R
