5|$|The Mahans {{typically}} had {{a tripod}} foremast with a pole mainmast. To improve the anti-aircraft field of fire, their tripod foremast was constructed without nautical rigging. In silhouette, they {{were similar to}} the larger s that immediately preceded them. The Mahans were fitted with the first emergency generators, replacing the storage batteries of earlier classes. Gun crew shelters were built for the superimposed weapons, one shelter before the bridge and one atop the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> aft.|$|E
5|$|An {{active sonar}} system was {{scheduled}} to be installed in June 1940, but it is uncertain when it was actually done. During the war, the ship's light anti-aircraft armament was augmented several times. Improved 2cm C/38 guns replaced the original C/30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941. The two guns on the aft <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> were replaced by a single 2cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably during her late 1941 refit. Richard Beitzen appears not have any additional AA guns added after this time.|$|E

2500|$|McLean {{secured a}} bank loan for $500 million and in January 1956 bought two World War II T-2 tankers, which he {{converted}} to carry containers on and under deck. McLean oversaw {{the construction of}} wooden <b>shelter</b> <b>decks,</b> known as Mechano decking. This was a common practice in World War II for the carriage of oversized cargo, such as aircraft. [...] It took several months to refit the ships, construct containers to carry on and below the vessels' decks and design trailer chassis to allow removable containers.|$|R
50|$|Westermann then {{denied a}} request from his senior gunnery officer to open fire on the German ships, and ordered his {{anti-aircraft}} artillery crews to seek <b>shelter</b> below <b>deck.</b>|$|R
25|$|A's most {{numerous}} {{product was}} another of its standard designs, the SD14 <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> cargo ship. During the Second World War, shipyards in the United States had delivered more than 2,700 Liberty ship <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> cargo ships. By the 1960s many Liberty ships were reaching {{the end of}} their service lives, so in 1965 A started to develop a low-cost shelter-deck cargo vessel to replace them.|$|E
25|$|The Ben-my-Chree {{was also}} fitted with 8 private cabins. These were {{located on the}} <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> and were {{exceptionally}} well furnished, fitted with sofas, a table and a folding lavatory.|$|E
25|$|In 1917 Hibernias ten 6-inch (152-mm) {{guns were}} removed from their casemates because they were flooded in heavy seas and {{replaced}} with four 6-inch (152-mm) guns on the higher <b>shelter</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
50|$|Main deck: <b>sheltered</b> {{exterior}} <b>deck</b> aft {{leading into}} the saloon; dining room and galley; entrance amidships; owner's suite forward, usually includes a study, and sometimes a second stateroom for a personal assistant/bodyguard.|$|R

25|$|Situated on the {{promenade}} deck was a tea room which was paneled in grey sycamore and mahogany. Below this {{there was the}} Lady's Saloon, which was finished in satin wood and walnut. The smoke room with adjacent bar was situated in the after part of the deck-house on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early in 1925 Joyce {{returned}} with his 9 thoroughbreds to the United States on the SS California from an extended engagement in London. It {{was a very}} rough passage. Captain James Blaike had to transfer the animals from improvised stalls on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> to an inner freight square on another deck.|$|E
25|$|C Deck, the <b>Shelter</b> <b>Deck,</b> was {{the highest}} deck to run {{uninterrupted}} from stem to stern. It included both well decks; the aft one served {{as part of the}} Third Class promenade. Crew cabins were housed below the forecastle and Third Class public rooms were housed below the Poop Deck. In between were the majority of First Class cabins and the Second Class library.|$|E

25|$|Z51, {{the only}} ship {{of the class}} to be laid down, was ordered from Deschimag on 25 November 1942, and {{launched}} on 2 October 1944. She was sunk during a major air raid on Bremen, on 21 March 1945. She had just been moved away from a fitting-out quay at the Deschimag yard, although heavily incomplete: she had only her forward and after <b>shelter</b> <b>decks,</b> no machinery was installed and her shaft tunnels had been welded up to make them watertight. From this {{it has been suggested}} that her launch was done only to clear the slip for U-boat building. She was lying abandoned, with her portside to the eastern end of Kohlenhafen, alongside Röchling wharf.|$|R
5000|$|Six Bays were {{completed}} to different designs. Dundrum Bay and Gerrans Bay were renamed Alert and Surprise and completed as [...] "despatch vessels", Commander-in-Chief's (C-in-C) yachts for the Mediterranean and Far East Stations. These ships omitted the Mark V Bofors mounts and the aft 4 in guns {{and had the}} superstructure extended to provide additional flag accommodation and stepped a tall mainmast. The four other ships {{were completed}} as survey vessels, specifically {{to deal with the}} vast numbers of uncharted wrecks and mines around the British Isles from wartime. They were unarmed, except for four 3-pounder saluting guns. They had shorter forward <b>shelter</b> <b>decks</b> and carried survey boats under davits abreast the funnel and minesweeping gear aft.|$|R
25|$|Owned by Isak Skaugen, Skaubryn {{was first}} {{intended}} to be a <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> cargo ship for one of his companies, Eikland. She was built by the Öresundsvarvet Shipbuilding Company in Landskrona, Sweden, and launched on October 7, 1950. Whilst being fitted out, Skaugen decided to have her completed as an emigrant liner, and she was transferred to the Howaldtswerke shipyard for completion as a passenger liner. When completed she offered tourist class accommodation for 1,205 passengers, as well as eight twin-bedded cabins accommodating 16 first class passengers on the bridge deck.|$|E
25|$|First class {{passengers}} had {{quarters in}} the midship {{house on the}} bridge and shelter decks with access to a saloon lighted by a skylight and dinging room. Some rooms had private lavatories, but lavatories for men and another for women were located aft of the engine casing on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> with another set {{in the center of}} the bridge deck accommodations. The upper deck was fitted for either light cargo or steerage passengers and, in the event of Chinese steerage passengers, had provision for a Chinese galley and wash area.|$|E
25|$|The hull was double {{bottomed}} with {{a capacity}} of 2,270 tons of fresh water for boilers or ship use with trimming tanks in the peaks and three deep tanks, one forward and two aft of the engine room, for a total water ballast of 4,600 tons. There were five complete decks composed of orlop, lower, middle, upper and shelter decks with the strength deck at the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> rather than usual upper deck with ten watertight bulkheads running up to the upper deck. Normal coal capacity was 1,950 tons but that could be increased by use of reserve bunkers to 2,800 tons.|$|E

50|$|Paducah was {{modified}} {{in the early}} 1930s to run on oil-fired boilers. The triple expansion engines were installed, with boilers fore and aft. Additional modifications included hammock berthing on a new boat <b>deck,</b> and a <b>sheltered</b> main <b>deck</b> between the quarterdeck and the pilot house.|$|R
50|$|In August 1992, James K. Polk began a nineteen-month {{shipyard}} conversion that {{removed her}} ballistic missiles and deactivated her missile tubes, converted her into an attack submarine, and installed Dry <b>Deck</b> <b>Shelters</b> on her <b>deck</b> {{which would allow}} her to support special warfare operations. Upon completion of this conversion in March 1994, her hull classification symbol was changed from SSBN-645 to SSN-645 to reflect her conversion from a fleet ballistic missile submarine to an attack submarine.|$|R
25|$|C Deck, the <b>Shelter</b> <b>Deck,</b> was the {{uppermost}} deck to run uninterrupted from the ships' bow to stern. It included the two well decks, {{both of which}} served as the Third Class promenade spaces. Each well deck also contained large cranes for loading cargo into the interior holds. Crew cabins were located under the forecastle and Third Class public rooms were situated under the Poop Deck. The superstructure of C Deck between the bow and stern contained mostly First Class accommodation, but the Second Class Library was also placed further aft, directly below the Second Class Smoking Room. This was the first deck to feature portholes.|$|E
25|$|Ben-my-Chree's {{design was}} very much suited to the Edwardian era. Her five decks {{consisted}} of lower, main, shelter, promenade and boat decks, and offered ample room for her passengers. The promenade deck extended over two-thirds of the vessel's length. Above the promenade deck was the boat deck, extending over half of her length and affording ample shelter to passengers during inclement weather. The <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> was carried right fore and aft, and on each side there was a fine promenade. The centre of this deck consisted of cabins and public rooms while on the two decks below (the main and lower) there were additional public saloons. The first class passengers occupied the forward part {{of the ship and}} the second class the after part. There was a wide companionway forward allowing access to all decks via stairways.|$|E
500|$|The ship's {{secondary}} armament {{consisted of}} seven 45-caliber [...] Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1893 naval guns. Four were mounted in individual casemates {{on the main}} deck; two more were mounted on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> with gun shields and the last gun was mounted in a <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> turret superfiring over the rear main gun turret. This was the first superfiring turret in naval history and, in this case, was not very successful because {{the barrel of the}} 138mm gun was too short to clear the sighting hood of the turret below. These guns fired [...] shells at muzzle velocities of [...]|$|E
50|$|A {{platform}} for six 5-inch rocket launchers. This platform was rather unsophisticated as the rocket launchers were {{fixed to the}} deck, and so the ship had to be maneuvered to aim them. When fired the crew had to take <b>shelter</b> below <b>decks</b> to escape the blast of the rocket engines.|$|R

500|$|Hoods {{secondary}} armament was a dozen 50-calibre BL 5.5-inch Mk I guns, {{each with}} 200 rounds. They were shipped on shielded single pivot mounts fitted along {{the upper deck}} and the forward <b>shelter</b> <b>deck.</b> This high position allowed them to be worked during heavy weather as they were less affected by waves and spray compared with the casemate mounts of earlier British capital ships. Two of these guns on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> were temporarily replaced by QF 4-inch Mk V anti-aircraft (AA) guns between 1938 and 1939. All the 5.5-inch guns were removed during another refit in 1940. The gun fired a [...] shell to a maximum range of [...]|$|E
500|$|In 1931, {{a pair of}} octuple {{mountings}} for the [...] QF 2-pounder Mk VIII gun {{were added}} on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck,</b> abreast the funnels, and a third mount was added in 1937. These gun mounts could depress to −10° and elevate {{to a maximum of}} +80°. The Mk VIII 2-pounder gun fired a [...] shell at a muzzle velocity of [...] to a distance of [...] The gun's rate of fire was approximately 96–98 rounds per minute.|$|E
500|$|During the war the ship's light {{anti-aircraft}} armament was augmented several times. In April 1941, improved 2cm C/38 guns {{replaced the}} original C/30 guns and three additional guns were added. The two {{guns on the}} aft <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> were replaced at some point by a single 2cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably in 1942. Sometime in 1944–45, Ihn received a partial [...] "Barbara" [...] anti-aircraft refit where twin 2cm mounts replaced her singles, giving her a total of 18 2cm barrels.|$|E
