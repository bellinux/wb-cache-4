5000|$|Many {{types of}} early guns {{required}} two {{different forms of}} gunpowder (such as a flintlock with finer priming powder for the pan, and a coarser <b>standard</b> <b>powder</b> for the main charge), necessitating two containers, a main flask and a smaller [...] "priming flask". During roughly the 18th century, paper cartridges {{became more and more}} popular, and a higher proportion of flasks made were the smaller priming variety. It appears that the British Army in the Peninsular War, despite regulations specifying the issue of powder horns and priming flasks, found the former inferior in action to cartridges, with the measuring spout prone to get detached and lost, and informally switched to cartridges during the war. The powder flask was finally rendered obsolete by the spread of breech-loading guns and the innovations brought about by Hall, Sharps, Spencer, and the later development of self-contained cartridges that were developed and marketed successfully by Oliver Winchester, after which manufactured cartridges or bullets became <b>standard.</b> <b>Powder</b> flasks were also used for priming naval cannon; such a flask would be as large as, or even larger than, a main flask for a personal sidearm.

X-ray diffractograms of epoxy cement show it to be amorphous with no sharp diagnostic peaks. With copper radiation the epoxy exhibits only a broad low-angle scattering peak between 12. 5 ° and 25 ° 20. This peak is depressed by dilution of the epoxy with sample powders.
