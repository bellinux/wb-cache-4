40|$|We {{introduce}} strategists to the Mindspace {{framework and}} explore its applications in <b>strategic</b> <b>contexts.</b> This framework consists of nine effective behavioral interventions which {{are grounded in}} the public policy applications, and focuses on how changing the context can {{be more effective than}} attempts to de-bias decision-makers. Behavioral changes are likely when we follow rather than fight human nature. Better decisions can be achieved by engineering choice contexts to “engage a bias” to overcome a more damaging bias. We illustrate how to engineer <b>strategic</b> <b>contexts</b> through two <b>case</b> studies and outline directions and challenges when applying Mindspace to strategic decisions...|$|R
40|$|Based on multiple-case research, {{this paper}} {{develops}} {{a model of}} strategic information systems (IS) investment in {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). IS investment is modelled as a function of an SME's <b>strategic</b> <b>context</b> as defined by its strategic focus, i. e. cost reduction versus value added and its market positioning, i. e. few versus many customers. The paper first investigates the ways in which IS may add value to organizations. It then outlines the use of IS in SMEs. This is followed by an analysis of competitiveness in small businesses. The paper develops an analytical model, which is termed the focus-dominance model, analyses case studies of 27 firms and reports that IS investment is strongly influenced by an SME's <b>strategic</b> <b>context.</b> Four <b>cases</b> are presented in order to illustrate the four different IS profiles identified. Finally, the implications for theory and practice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{pressing}} {{need to understand}} the challenges surrounding procurement of and business case development for hospital electronic prescribing systems, and to identify possible strategies to enhance the efficiency of these processes in order to assist strategic decision making. We organized eight multi-disciplinary round-table discussions in the United Kingdom. Participants included policy makers, representatives from hospitals, system developers, academics, and patients. Each discussion was digitally audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and, together with accompanying field notes, analyzed thematically with NVivo 9. We drew on data from 17 participants (approximately eight per roundtable), six hours of discussion, and 15 pages of field notes. Key challenges included silo planning with systems not being considered as part of an integrated organizational information technology strategy, lack of opportunity for interactions between customers and potential suppliers, lack of support for hospitals in choosing appropriate systems, difficulty of balancing structured planning with flexibility, and the on-going challenge of distinguishing "wants" and aspirations from organizational "needs". Development of business cases for major investments in information technology does not take place in an organizational vacuum. Building on previously identified potentially transferable dimensions to the development and execution of business cases surrounding measurements of costs/benefits and risk management, we have identified additional components relevant to ePrescribing systems. These include: considerations surrounding <b>strategic</b> <b>context,</b> <b>case</b> for change and objectives, future service requirements and options appraisal, capital and revenue implications, timescale and deliverability, and risk analysis and management...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} role of policy {{leadership}} in German defence and security policy between 1990 and 2002, with particular reference to reform of the Bundeswehr. It situates this case study in the framework of a set of analytical perspectives about policy change derived from public policy theory, arguing that public policy theory has either underestimated policy leadership or failed to discriminate different leadership roles, styles and strategies. The author rejects the dominant contextualist and culturalist approach to leadership in studies of German defence and security policy in favour of an interactionist approach that stresses the dialectical interaction between policy skills and <b>strategic</b> <b>context.</b> The <b>case</b> study also shifts the focus in studies of policy leadership in Germany away from a preoccupation with the Chancellor to the role of ministerial and administrative leadership within the core executive. The thesis illustrates the strongly self-referential nature of Bundeswehr reform, despite adaptational pressures from Europeanisation and 'NATO-isation', and the domestic politics of base closures. It also shows how domestic macro-political arrangements predispose leadership roles in German defence and security policy towards brokerage and veto playing rather than towards entrepreneurship...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{decades of}} {{intervention}} to promote equal pay, the gender wage gap in Australia persists. A key {{explanation is that}} equal pay strategies have had limited capacity to address the subtle, historical undervaluation that keep wages low in highly feminized areas of employment, especially where care work is performed. In this article, we examine a recent attempt to address the undervaluation of care work through a test case of the expanded equal remuneration clause in the Fair Work Act 2009. A highly feminized area of employment, the social and community services industry proved a <b>strategic</b> <b>context</b> for the <b>case.</b> We discuss three significant aspects of the case: the recognition given to the undervaluation of care work; the divergent interests of non-government sector employers and business associations; and strong contestation over who should pay, arising from the government's third-party role as purchaser of social and community services. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This study {{contributes}} to critical information systems research {{understanding of the}} broader <b>strategic</b> <b>context</b> of information systems initiatives in developing countries. It investigates contextual influences with structural impacts {{that may lead to}} instabilities and discontinuities in the immediate project context using a critical realist paradigm. It was informed by literature on development as discourse, ICT 4 D policy and technology transfer, E-Government adoption, and information systems research paradigms and applications in developing countries. A disconnection was observed between ICT 4 D policy practice that favors positivist technology diffusion models and research findings that suggest interpretive and critical contextual approaches. A theoretical framework was developed to reconsider ICT 4 D from a postcolonial country perspective by integrating critiques of modernity from Critical realism and postcolonial theory. An empirical case study investigation of change in Kenya‘s transition to E-Governance was then conducted and analyzed using a critical realist research framework, the Morphogenetic approach, supplemented by Q-methodology to study subjectivity. Finally ICT change was interpreted using critical realist concepts for structure, culture, and agency, with an overriding direction towards greater freedom. The main research contribution is a new approach to ICT 4 D where change is conceived within a dialectical framework that assumes people are moral and ethical beings possessing values. Research findings have implications for understanding the <b>strategic</b> <b>context</b> of E-Governance and ICT 4 D, time and temporality in contextual integrative frameworks, and suggest an alternative approach to strategy analysis in situations of rapid political and institutional change. They highlight the importance of political leaders and development agencies as mediators and interpreters of the <b>strategic</b> <b>context.</b> Development was conceived as a dialectical process towards transformative praxis, which together with the suggested approach to the <b>strategic</b> <b>context,</b> may require us to rethink the meaning of IS project success or failure in postcolonial developing countries.
