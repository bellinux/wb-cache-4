The positions of the courses {{in the vicinity of}} the crown were first marked out at right angles to the faces using long wooden straight-edges, then the remaining courses were marked out in parallel.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{provides}} a J estimation <b>of</b> <b>intrados</b> circumferential through-wall center cracked elbow under in-plane bending. To find the finite element (FE) J-integral, non-linear three-dimensional finite element analyses are performed. The material properties for elastic-plastic FE analysis {{are assumed to}} be a Ramberg-Osgood model. Validity of that estimation of circumferential through-wall cracked elbow under given loading condition is evaluated. Next, effects of the elbow geometry and crack lengths are systematically investigated. Results are presented in the failure assessment diagram (FAD) space. The results show that FE J of circumferential through-wall center cracked elbow give more non-conservative results than reference stress based J estimation by R 6. If an optimized reference moment was taken into consideration, almost all FE J values in the given range have only slight different of its elbow geometry and crack lengths...|$|R

50|$|The arch of {{the bridge}} was made of local stone known as tenelija. The shape of the arch {{is the result of}} {{numerous}} irregularities produced by the deformation <b>of</b> the <b>intrados</b> (the inner line of the arch). The most accurate description would be that it is a circle of which the centre is depressed in relation to the string course.|$|R
25|$|Nicholson {{approached}} {{the problem by}} constructing a development <b>of</b> the <b>intrados</b> <b>of</b> the arch from the plan and elevation drawings, effectively unrolling and flattening the surface, then drawing the courses perpendicular to the faces, adding the header joints perpendicular to the courses, then finally rolling up the development diagram by projecting the detail <b>of</b> the <b>intrados</b> back onto the plan and elevation drawings, a technique also used by others who would later offer alternative solutions to the problem. This method resulted in the courses of stone voussoirs making up {{the barrel of the}} skew arch following parallel helical paths between the abutments, giving the view along the barrel an attractive rifled appearance. Although these courses meet the arch faces at right angles at the crown of the arch, the nearer they are to the springing line the greater their deviation from perpendicularity. Thus Nicholson's method is not the perfect solution, but it is a workable one that has one great advantage over more purist alternatives, namely that since the helical courses run parallel to each other, all the voussoir stones can be cut to the same pattern, the only exceptions being the ring stones, or quoins, where the barrel meets the faces of the arch, each of which is unique but has an identical copy in the other face.|$|R

40|$|The authors {{address the}} {{structural}} behavior of masonry arches strengthened through carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips at intrados or extrados surfaces {{and subjected to}} horizontal forces. The paper reports and compares results from experimental tests on 1 : 2 -scale arches and from an analytical model that considers no-tensile strength, infinite rigid, and infinite compressive strength material. Under {{the assumption that the}} structure fails because of the formation of a four-hinge collapse mechanism, the model allows the calculation of the collapse load and the evaluation of the load-displacement diagram. The model is based on the equilibrium conditions and considers finite displacements. Results provide an evaluation of the dependence of arch structural behavior on the length of CFRP strengthening. In particular, the postpeak behavior is evaluated in the perspective of performance-based seismic design criteria, which regard the ultimate displacement as a key parameter for seismic capacity. The evaluation shows that, for the considered case study, an increase <b>of</b> <b>intrados</b> reinforcement length produces an increase of maximum load but a decrease of the ultimate displacement...|$|R
