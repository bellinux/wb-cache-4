40|$|We {{study the}} sparse set {{conjecture}} for sets with low density. The sparse set conjecture states that P = NP if {{and only if}} there exists a sparse Turing <b>hard</b> <b>set</b> for NP. In this paper we study a weaker variant of the conjecture. We are interested in the consequences of NP having Turing <b>hard</b> <b>sets</b> of density f(n), for (unbounded) functions f(n), that are sub-polynomial, for example log(n). We establish a connection between Turing <b>hard</b> <b>sets</b> for NP with density f(n) and bounded nondeterminism: We prove that if NP has a Turing <b>hard</b> <b>set</b> of density f(n), then satisfiability is computable in polynomial time with O(log(n) *f(n^c)) many nondeterministic bits for some constant c. As a consequence of the proof technique we obtain absolute results about the density of Turing <b>hard</b> <b>sets</b> for EXP. We show that no Turing <b>hard</b> <b>set</b> for EXP can have sub-polynomial density. On the other hand we show that these results are optimal w. r. t. relativizing computations. For unbounded functions f(n), there exists an oracle relative to which NP has a f(n) dense Turing <b>hard</b> tally <b>set</b> but still P is different from NP. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|We prove {{unlikely}} {{consequences of}} the existence of sparse <b>hard</b> <b>sets</b> for P under deterministic as well as one-sided error randomized truth-table reductions. Our main results are as follows. We establish that the existence of a polynomially dense <b>hard</b> <b>set</b> for P under (randomized) logspace bounded truth-table reductions implies that P ` (R) L, and that the collapse goes down to P ` (R) NC 1 in case of reductions computable in (R) NC 1.

The randomized space complexity classes we consider are based on the multiple access randomness concept. 1 Introduction A lot of research effort in complexity theory has been spent on the sparse <b>hard</b> <b>set</b> problem for NP, i. e., the question whether there are sparse <b>hard</b> <b>sets</b> for NP under various polynomial-time reducibilities.
