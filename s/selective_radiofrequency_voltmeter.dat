40|$|A {{new method}} for {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) employing non-Fourier encoding using spatially <b>selective</b> <b>radiofrequency</b> (RF) excitation is presented. The method uses manipulation of spatially selective RF pulses to encode spins in the slice-select direction. The method has several advantages over standard multislice approaches. It provides a simple means for monitoring irregularly distributed sections throughout a volume without the need to encode the whole volume. It offers the potential for increased signal-to-noise ratio if an appropriate basis is used for encoding. With a unique design of excitation pulses, it also appears possible to significantly reduce in-flow effects. An interleaved echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence was adapted for non-Fourier encoding in the slice-select direction and was implemented on a conventional 1. 5 -Telsa system.

It employs a catheter-based device to cause thermal injury to the sympathetic nerves surrounding the renal arteries, with the aim to reduce renal sympathetic overactivity (so-called [...] "renal denervation") and thereby reduce blood pressure. It has been employed in clinical trials for resistant hypertension. [...] However, a prospective, single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial failed to confirm a beneficial effect. Infrequent renal artery dissection, femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, excessive decreases in blood pressure and heart rate have been reported. A 2014 consensus statement from The Joint UK Societies recommended radiofrequency ablation not be used for the treatment of resistant hypertension, but supported continuing clinical trials. Patient selection, with attention to measurement of pre- and post-procedure sympathetic nerve activity and norepinephrine levels, may help differentiate responders from non-responders to this procedure.|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} is described to localize MR signals from a target volume using nonlinear pulsed magnetic fields and spatial encoding trajectories designed using local k-space theory. The concept of local k-space is outlined theoretically, and this principle {{is applied to}} simulated phantom and cardiac MRI data {{in the presence of}} surface and quadrupolar gradient coil phase modulation. Phantom and in vivo human brain images are obtained using a custom, high-performance quadrupolar gradient coil integrated with a whole-body 3 -T MRI system to demonstrate target localization using three-dimensional Tmath image-weighted spoiled gradient echo, two-dimensional segmented, multiple gradient encoded spin echo, and three-dimensional balanced steady-state free precession acquisitions.

30|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} spectroscopy (MRS), for example, {{can be used}} {{to dissect}} the molecular composition of tissues by applying <b>selective</b> <b>radiofrequency</b> excitation pulses. Functional processes in living subjects can also be studied by diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI. Here, the magnetic field, generated by different gradients, is used to map phase differences in the MRI signal that are caused by diffusing molecules. DW-MRI has potential clinical applications ranging from diagnosing ischaemia, cancer, multiple sclerosis, or Alzheimer’s disease to general fibre tracking via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and it is not restricted to the brain. In addition, functional MRI (fMRI) studies can be performed during the same examination. Functional MRI studies are frequently based on the BOLD (blood oxygen level-dependent) effect. This effect describes the fact that the magnetic properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin in the blood are different and, therefore, produce different signals when imaged with T 2 *-sensitive MRI sequences. The BOLD effect also has certain applications in cancer imaging, such as to study tumour angiogenesis, tumour oxygenation and brain activation in relevant areas before surgical resection.|$|R

To avoid fold-over artifacts, using a sufficiently large field of view in phase-encoding direction is mandatory. The related oversampling affects scanning time and respiratory chest motion artifacts are commonly observed. The excitation of a volume that exclusively includes the heart without its surrounding structures may help to improve scan efficiency and minimize motion artifacts. Therefore, and by building on previously reported inner-volume approach, the combination of a black-blood fast spin-echo sequence with a two-dimensionally <b>selective</b> <b>radiofrequency</b> pulse is proposed for selective "local excitation" small field of view imaging of the heart.

40|$|Unilateral {{radiofrequency}} lesions {{or chemical}} lesions with 6 -hydroxydopamine were {{produced in the}} substantia nigra of rat brain in order to destroy dopaminergic innervations to caudate nucleus and thereby to produce functional denervation supersensitivity. Both types of lesions resulted in enhanced stimulation of caudate adenylate cyclase (EC 4. 6. 1. 1) activity by dopamine at all dopamine concentrations tested, with more marked enhancement at the lower concentrations. Response to another dopamine agonist, 1 -(3, 4 -dihydroxybenzyl) - 4 -(20 pyrimidinyl) piperazine (S 584) was also enhanced. 6 -Hydroxydopamine lesions resulted in selective enhancement of the dopamine-stimulated component of adenylate cyclase, whereas radiofrequency lesions resulted also in a marked decrease in basal activity. It is postulated that the basal activity of caudate represents primarily an adenylate cyclase distinct from that stimulated by dopamine and destroyed only by the less <b>selective</b> <b>radiofrequency</b> lesion.

The rightward extension {{is on the right}} atrial aspect, close to the septal attachment of the tricuspid valve leaflet and, hence, closely related to the anticipated slow pathway considered {{to play a role in}} atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). This report documents a patient, 65 years of age, with dilated cardiomyopathy and AVNRT. The tachycardia was successfully terminated using <b>selective</b> <b>radiofrequency</b> (RF) ablation, delivered at a site where a slow potential was recorded and validated by atrial pacing, located between the tricuspid valve and the os of the coronary sinus (CS), close to its superior rim.

Histopathologic examination revealed extensive scar tissue at the site of the burn, extending onto the crest of the underlying ventricular septum. Serial sections revealed the compact AV node superiorly and an inferior extension surfacing from the scar which could be traced inferiorly beyond the os of the CS. This is the first documentation of RF ablation interrupting an inferior extension of the compact AV node in a patient successfully ablated for AVNRT.

40|$|PURPOSE: To improve {{coronary}} {{magnetic resonance}} angiography (MRA) by combining a two-dimensional (2 D) spatially <b>selective</b> <b>radiofrequency</b> (RF) pulse with a T 2 -preparation module (" 2 D-T 2 -Prep"). METHODS: An adiabatic T 2 -Prep was modified {{so that the}} first and last pulses were of differing spatial selectivity. The first RF pulse was replaced by a 2 D pulse, such that a pencil-beam volume is excited. The last RF pulse remains nonselective, thus restoring the T 2 -prepared pencil-beam, while tipping the (formerly longitudinal) magnetization outside of the pencil-beam into the transverse plane, where it is then spoiled. Thus, only a cylinder of T 2 -prepared tissue remains for imaging. Numerical simulations were followed by phantom validation and in vivo coronary MRA, where the technique was quantitatively evaluated. Reduced field-of-view (rFoV) images were similarly studied. RESULTS: In vivo, full field-of-view 2 D-T 2 -Prep significantly improved vessel sharpness as compared to conventional T 2 -Prep, without adversely affecting signal-to-noise (SNR) or contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR). It also reduced respiratory motion artifacts. In rFoV images, the SNR, CNR, and vessel sharpness decreased, although scan time reduction was 60 %. CONCLUSION: When compared with conventional T 2 -Prep, the 2 D-T 2 -Prep improves vessel sharpness and decreases respiratory ghosting while preserving both SNR and CNR.

Background. The recent introduction of radiofrequency ablation to treat AV node reentrant tachycardia allows {{the opportunity to}} {{study the effects of}} selective elimination of the different limbs involved in AV node reentrant tachycardia. Methods. Selective fast pathway ablation was attempted in 13 patients by delivering radiofrequency energy anteriorly across the tricuspid valve anulus. Selective slow pathway ablation was attempted in 29 patients by delivering radiofrequency energy posteriorly across the tricuspid valve anulus at sites where putative slow pathway potentials were recorded. Results. Selective fast pathway ablation eliminated AV node reentrant tachycardia without AV block in 6 (46 %) of 13 patients after one ablation session and in an additional 3 patients (69 % of total) after repeat ablation sessions. Slow pathway ablation eliminated AV node reentrant tachycardia without AV block in 26 (90 %) of 29 patients after one radiofrequency ablation session and in an additional 2 patients (97 % of total) after repeat ablation sessions. Selective fast pathway ablation increased the PR interval (140 to 220 ms, p = 0. 0001) and AH interval (66 to 153 ms, p = 0. 0001), whereas slow pathway ablation did not change these intervals. Fast pathway radiofrequency ablation caused retrograde block in 7 (64 %) of 11 patients, whereas no patients undergoing slow pathway ablation developed selective retrograde block. Single AV node echo beats were commonly induced after slow but not fast pathway ablation (17 of 29 patients vs. 1 of 11 patients, respectively, p = 0. 01) and did not predict recurrence of AV node reentrant tachycardia. Conclusions. Successful <b>selective</b> <b>radiofrequency</b> ablation of fast or slow pathways in patients with AV node reentrant tachycardia resulted in different eletrophysiologic properties after ablation.

It is shown that the criterion depends only upon amplitude of the time-dependent field applied to the system, and the Magnus expansion converges and the Magnus solution exists when the flip angle of a non-negative-amplitude shaped RF pulse or a weak-amplitude shaped pulse is smaller than 2 pi. The exponential propagator then can be decomposed into a product of a series of elementary propagators and can be used to determine time evolution of the spin system under the shaped pulse. The linear differential equations to determine the unknown parameters in the Magnus solution are obtained explicitly.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{show that}} a {{combination}} of parallel imaging using sensitivity encoding (SENSE) and inner volume imaging (IVI) combines the known benefits of both techniques. SENSE with a reduced field of excitation (rFOX) is termed rSENSE. THEORY AND METHODS: The noise level in SENSE reconstructions is reduced by removing voxels from the unfolding process that are rendered silent by using rFOX. The silent voxels need to be identified beforehand, this is done by using rFOX in the coil sensitivity maps. In vivo experiments were performed at 7 Tesla using a 32 -channel receive coil. RESULTS: Good image quality could be obtained in vivo with rSENSE at acceleration factors that are higher than could be obtained using SENSE or IVI alone. With rSENSE we were also able to accelerate scans using an rFOX that was purposely designed to be imperfect or incompatible at all with IVI. CONCLUSION: rSENSE has been demonstrated in vivo with two-dimensionally <b>selective</b> <b>radiofrequency</b> pulses. Besides allowing additional scan acceleration, it offers a greater robustness and flexibility than IVI. The proposed method can be used with other field strengths, anatomies and other rFOX techniques.

Thus, {{there is a need for}} sensitive imaging biomarkers that can predict functional impairment in patients with advanced cervical spondylosis. Purpose: To implement diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as an imaging biomarker for microstructural integrity and functional impairment in patients with cervical spondylosis. Study design: Nonrandomized, single institution study. Patient sample: Forty-eight cervical spondylosis patients with or without spinal cord signal change underwent DTI of the spinal cord along with functional assessment. Outcome measures: Functional measures of neurologic function via modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score. Methods: A zoomed-echoplanar imaging technique and two-dimensional spatially <b>selective</b> <b>radiofrequency</b> excitation pulse were used for DTI measurement. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial and axial diffusion (AD) coefficient, AD anisotropy, ψ, defined as AD-MD, and the standard deviation (SD) of primary eigenvector orientation were evaluated at the site of compression. Results: Results suggest average FA, transverse apparent diffusion coefficient, ψ, and SD of primary eigenvector orientation at the spinal level of highest compression were linearly correlated with mJOA score. Receiver-operator characteristic analysis suggested FA and ψ could identify stenosis patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms with a relatively high sensitivity and specificity.

By incorporating a "pencil beam" 2 D pulse into a T 2 -Prep, one may create a " 2 D-T 2 -Prep" that combines T 2 -weighting with an intrinsic outer volume suppression. This may particularly benefit parallel imaging techniques, where artefacts typically originate from residual foldover signal. By suppressing foldover signal with a 2 D-T 2 -Prep, image quality may therefore improve. We present numerical simulations, phantom and in vivo validations to address this hypothesis. A 2 D-T 2 -Prep and a conventional T 2 -Prep were used with GRAPPA-accelerated MRI (R = 1. 6). The techniques were first compared in numerical phantoms, where per pixel maps of SNR (SNRmulti), noise, and g-factor were predicted for idealized sequences. Physical phantoms, with compartments doped to mimic blood, myocardium, fat, and coronary vasculature, were scanned with both T 2 -Preparation techniques to determine the actual SNRmulti and vessel sharpness. For in vivo experiments, the right coronary artery (RCA) was imaged in 10 healthy adults, using accelerations of R = 1, 3, and 6, and vessel sharpness was measured for each. In both simulations and phantom experiments, the 2 D-T 2 -Prep improved SNR relative to the conventional T 2 -Prep, by an amount that depended on both the acceleration factor and the degree of outer volume suppression. For in vivo images of the RCA, vessel sharpness improved most at higher acceleration factors, demonstrating that the 2 D-T 2 -Prep especially benefits accelerated coronary MRA. Suppressing outer volume signal with a 2 D-T 2 -Prep improves image quality particularly well in GRAPPA-accelerated acquisitions in simulations, phantoms, and volunteers, demonstrating that it should be considered when performing accelerated coronary MRA...|$|R

A {{comprehensive}} electrophysiologic study {{followed by}} <b>selective</b> <b>radiofrequency</b> ablation from three sites {{was performed in}} patients with atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia to better delineate {{the nature of the}} tachycardia circuit. Background. We postulated that the retrograde fast pathway is the anterior superficial group of transitional cells and the slow pathway is the compact node with its posterior input of transitional cells. Twenty-three consecutive patients were studied. In nine, the atria could be dissociated from the tachycardia by delivery of an atrial extrastimulus during tachycardia. Methods. Radiofrequency ablation was performed with three approaches. The anterior approach was designed to interrupt the anterior superficial atrial input to the compact node, the posterior approach to Interrupt the posterior atrial input to the compact node and the inferior approach to destroy the compact node itself. Results. Selective ablation of the retrograde fast pathway was achieved in seven patients, six with the anterior and one with the inferior approach. Anterograde fast pathway conduction was not affected, whereas retrograde fast pathway conduction was either abolished or markedly depressed. None had induction of echoes or tachycardia after ablation. Selective ablation of the slow pathway was successful in 13 patients, 1 with anterior, 3 with posterior and 9 with inferior approaches. In these 13 patients, boili anterograde and retrograde fast pathway conduction were not affected, the dual pathway physiology was abolished and the tachycardia was not inducible after ablation. Ablation of both the retrograde fast pathway and the slow pathway occurred with the inferior approach in three patients. Conclusions. We conclude that the retrograde fast pathway {{is likely to be the}} anterior superficial group of transitional cells, whereas the slow pathway is the compact node and its posterior input of transitional cells.

The potency (EC 50) and maximal effect (Emax) of adenosine to slow AV and VA conductions were determined in 16 patients (mean age 48 years). These patients {{were selected from}} a group that had a common form of AV nodal reentrant tachycardia who had prior to the study been subjected to <b>selective</b> <b>radiofrequency</b> ablation of the slow pathway conduction, but with intact antegrade and retrograde fast pathway conduction. During high right atrial and ventricular pacing at comparable cycle lengths (400 – 500 msec). adenosine was injected as an intravenous bolus at an initial dose of 0. 5 mg followed by stepwise increase of 1 mg given every 5 minutes until AV or VA block occurred. The dose-response curves for adenosine-induced prolongation of AV and VA conduction time were determined. The 1 : 1 AV and VA conduction cycle lengths before injection of adenosine were 340 ± 50 and 326 ± 75 msec, respectively. Adenosine induced dose-dependent prolongation of AV nodal conduction time and caused typical Wenckebach AV block in all 16 patients with EC 50 and Emax values of 1. 4 ± 0. 8 mg and 54 ± 2 %, respectively. Adenosine also induced dose-dependent prolongation of VA conduction time and VA block, however, with significantly (P< 0. 051 higher EC 50 and shorter Emax, i. e., 6. 1 ± 1 mg and 20 ± 2 %, respectively. The mean dose of adenosine to induce AV block is significantly lower than that to induce VA block (3. 3 ± 1. 6 vs. 7. 7 ± 3. 3 mg, P< 005). Notably, adenosine induced Wenckebach VA block in 10 of 16 patients and Mobitz type II block in 6 of 16 patients. In conclusion, adenosine is more potent in slowing AV than VA conduction, suggesting that the electrical wavefront entering the N zone of AV node is less affected by adenosine during VA than during AV conduction.

40|$|Spin-half nuclei in a {{magnetic}} field possessing a population difference in excess of that expected at thermal equilibrium {{are said to be}} hyperpolarised. Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation (DNP) is a method to generate hyperpolarised systems, pumping nuclear spins into a given state at low temperature. Hyperpolarised samples can be rapidly dissolved in a hot solvent, and maintain a highly polarised spin population that relaxes to the new thermal equilibrium over several minutes. It is possible to inject hyperpolarised molecules into an organism, sample the population difference through NMR spectroscopy, and obtain spectra with a large (> 10 4) increase in their signal-to-noise ratio compared to thermal equilibrium. The use of hyperpolarised [1 - 13 C]pyruvate allows for the quantification of the rate of [1 - 13 C]lactate production, increases of which are a defining characteristic of cancer; or the rate of 13 C-bicarbonate production, which is altered in heart disease. This thesis describes the development of magnetisation-efficient sequences of spectrally-and-spatially <b>selective</b> <b>radiofrequency</b> pulses and rapid imaging readouts that are able to image the metabolism of hyperpolarised [1 - 13 C]pyruvate in three dimensional space, with a reconstructed resolution of 1 Ã 1 Ã 2 mm 3. The techniqueâs sensitivity to metabolism is demonstrated, and attempts are made to image cancer that has metastasised to the brain prior to the point of conventional detection through its metabolic phenotype. It is also used to image metabolism in the post ischÃ¦mic myocardium, where it reports on regions of non-viable tissue. Additionally, hyperpolarised 13 C-urea is used as a 'metabolically inert' probe of perfusion in the myocardium. Flow-sensitisation gradients and a spiral readout allow 13 C-urea to be resolved in the myocardium. The ability to 'co-polarise' [1 - 13 C]pyruvate and 13 C-urea is demonstrated. This technique could simultaneously resolve perfusion deficits and metabolic changes in the acutely damaged heart, with several potential advantages over current clinical methods. Finally, several methods for analysing data generated by hyperpolarised experiments are proposed: weighted averaging for combining spectroscopic data of varying quality; novel Bayesian approaches to quantifying metabolic rate constants of interest following the injection of hyperpolarised [1 - 13 C]pyruvate; and the Fast Padé Transformation as an improved method for the reconstruction of truncated hyperpolarised spectral data. DNP is a technique that, following its development for particle physics experiments in the 1970 s, is transitioning to clinical practice as a safe, novel molecular imaging modality. It is hoped that the techniques proposed in this text ultimately find wide utility in the assessment of cancer and heart disease, which combined are responsible for approximately 50 % of deaths occurring in the developed world. </p...|$|R

Recently, genetically modified mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs, also known as "mesenchymal stem cells") were demonstrated to generate pacemaker function in vivo. However, experimental approaches typically use open thoracotomy for direct cell injection into the myocardium. Future clinical implementation, however, essentially requires development of more gentle methods to precisely and efficiently apply specified stem cells at specific cardiac locations. In a "proof of concept" study, we performed <b>selective</b> power-controlled <b>radiofrequency</b> catheter ablation (RFCA) with eight ablation pulses (30 W, 60 seconds each) to induce heat-mediated lesions at the auricles of the cardiac right atrium of four healthy foxhounds. The next day, allogeneic MSCs (4. 3 x 10 (5) cells per kilogram of body weight) labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIOs) were infused intravenously. Hearts were explanted 8 days later. High numbers of SPIO-labeled cells were identified in areas surrounding the RFCA-induced lesions by Prussian blue staining. Antibody staining revealed SPIO-labeled cells being positive for the typical MSC surface antigen CD 44. In contrast, low levels of calprotectin, an antigen found on monocytes and macrophages, indicated negligible infiltration of monocytes in MSC-positive areas. Thus, RFCA allows targeting of MSCs to the cardiac right atrium, adjacent to the sinoatrial node, providing an opportunity to rescue or generate pacemaker function without open thoracotomy and direct injection of MSCs. This method presents a new strategy for cardiac stem cell application leading to an efficient guidance of MSCs into the myocardium.

However, {{due to their}} multifocality and/or insufficient remnant liver volume, the majority of liver metastases are unresectable. For this reason, several local ablative techniques have been developed, aiming to produce selective tumour destruction and thus increase the rate of patients amenable to curative-intent treatments. Among these techniques, cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation only have proven to have a curative potential, while transarterial chemoembolization and alcohol injection {{should be considered as}} palliative options only. The local recurrences after cryoablation and radiofrequency are equivalent, inferior to 10 %, highly dependent of selection criteria. In contrast, morbidity is significantly increased after cryoablation, leading most of the teams to prefer the radiofrequency approach. Two major limitations for radiofrequency are, first, the risk to provoke heat biliary lesion in case of metastases located proximally to hilar plate, and second, the risk of insufficient ablation due to a cooling effect in case of metastases near to major vessels.

This method permits very fast acquisitions of targeted magnetization without complex or time-consuming image reconstruction techniques. Furthermore, because the data acquisition is performed without imaging gradients, T 2 * decays can be densely sampled and processed for contrast enhancement to improve {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} data quality. Here, the constrained source space imaging technique is validated in proof-of-concept form, for a simple functional magnetic resonance imaging motor task using a prototype dual-band stimulated echo acquisition mode excitation to image four voxels at TR = 250 ms. Results demonstrate good voxel signal separation and good characterization of hemodynamic responses in primary motor cortices (M 1) and supplementary motor areas through T 2 * fitting of the measured signals. With further refinement, the constrained source space imaging method has potential utility in a priori ROI-based functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments with TR values under 100 ms. Rapid, multivoxel measurements of other sources of MR signal contrast are also possible...|$|R
