Simulated feces (ersatz) will be inoculated with microbes representing normal fecal flora, mixed with urine brine and <b>shredded</b> <b>refuse</b> of products typically used in space missions. Composting methods often use alternating layers of waste with scraps of carboniferous materials (finely <b>shredded</b> <b>refuse).</b> By preparing membrane bags with a homogenized ersatz and carboniferous refuse mixture and membrane bags with alternating layers of ersatz and carboniferous refuse, {{it may be possible}} to monitor anaerobic thermophillic digestion of the waste if internal temperatures of 45 - 55 °C are reached (these temperatures can kill pathogenic microbes). Monitoring the temperature, pH, and osmolarity of membrane bags filled with this waste over a period of approximately 4 weeks can give valuable data to considering the plausibility of a compost-like procedure to sanitize and store human waste over a long period of time...|$|R
50|$|Thirteen {{years later}} Saki was {{challenged}} by the Ninja Turtles, who {{were the result of}} an accident exposing four ordinary turtles to radioactive waste. They were trained by Yoshi's pet rat Splinter, who had also been mutated by the same substance, to avenge his former master. After a lengthy rooftop battle where Saki seemed to be winning, Leonardo managed to plunge his sword through Saki's torso. Defeated, he was offered the opportunity to commit seppuku (ritual suicide), but <b>Shredder</b> <b>refused</b> and detonated a thermite grenade, in an attempt to take them with him to his death. However, in the last second Donatello used his bo to knock Shredder off the building to his death.|$|R
40|$|The bird-aircraft strike hazard is a world-wide problem {{resulting}} in human fatalities and aircraft damage. Although the exact cost of bird damage {{is difficult to}} obtain, United States Air Force losses are estimated at over $ 10 million per year (Harrison 1976). Collisions between birds and aircrafts occur either enroute or when planes are landing or taking off at airports. Most of these collisions are due to large flocks of birds attracted to the vicinity by food, shelter, or water (Solman 1971). Solid waste disposal sites are an abundant food source for many hazardous bird species, especially gulls and blackbirds; and if these sites are located near airports, they constitute {{a major cause of}} bird-aircraft collisions (Davidson et al. 1971). Thus information on the attractiveness of birds to solid waste disposal sites is important and may lead to a {{reduction in the number of}} bird-aircraft collisions. To date most studies have been conducted on open dumps and sanitary landfills because these were the commonest method of waste disposal. (See Forsythe (1976) for reviews of these studies.) However, the technique of milling or shredding solid waste has recently begun to replace other methods; and this trend will probably continue in the future. With the exception of a survey of 22 milling sites in Europe (Ham and Reinhardt 1973), little is known about the attractiveness of shredded material to birds potentially hazardous to aircraft. Hence data are needed on the attractiveness of <b>shredded</b> <b>refuse</b> to birds, so that a potentially hazardous bird-aircraft collision problem can be avoided if plans are made for the placement of shredded solid waste sites near airports...|$|R

Due to their refusal to help, Splinter partly blamed the Ninja Tribunal for Yoshi's death.|$|R

BACKGROUND: For both space and resource efficiency, the proposed habitat structure for living space shows an inner wall layer composed of membrane filtration bags. The outer wall is filled with a supply of freshwater that serves dual purpose as life support as well as radiation shielding. As wastewater is created, the forward osmosis membrane bags are filled with a mixture of wastewater and refuse That are then dried passively using forward osmosis, and then actively using low-pressure ventilation or other vacuum process...|$|R
40|$|Techniques were {{evaluated}} for {{formation of a}} liquid inoculum from <b>shredded</b> municipal <b>refuse,</b> including chilling the refuse at 4 °C prior to blending and multiple washing and blending cycles. The average count of cellulolytic bacteria from six different detachment treatments was 5. 1 × 104 cells per g (dry weight) of refuse {{with a range of}} 0. 7 × 104 to 12. 7 × 104 cells per g (dry weight). The liquid obtained from blending the refuse in phosphate buffer followed by hand squeezing was the selected detachment procedure. The inoculum formation procedure was validated by the addition of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria to refuse and recovery of the cellulolytic bacteria by most-probable-number enumerations. The ratio of measured to expected cell counts among tests in which different volumes of ruminal fluid were added to refuse ranged from 2. 7 to 14. 4. There was no evidence of anaerobic cellulolytic fungi in a refuse sample...|$|R
40|$|Production of non-methane organic {{compounds}} during refuse decomposition in a laboratory-scale landfill The presence of non-methane {{organic compounds}} (NMOCs) in landfill gas is well documented. However, {{there is little}} understanding {{of the degree to}} which the production of NMOCs should be attributed to the volatilization of household hazardous waste as opposed to intermediates of the anaerobic decomposition of the major cellulosic components of municipal solid waste. The objectives of this study were: (1) to compare the NMOC yields for decomposed refuse, fresh residential refuse, and a synthetic refuse; and (2) to evaluate the source of NMOCs emitted during refuse decomposition. Replicate 2 - 1 reactors were filled with <b>shredded</b> residential <b>refuse</b> expected to contain household hazardous waste, synthetic refuse containing no hazardous constituents, and control reactors with decomposed refuse only. Anaerobic decomposition of each refuse was initiated with a seed of decomposed refuse, and the reported methane and NMOC yields were corrected for that attributable to the seed. The NMOC yields from the seed, synthetic refuse, and residential refuse were comparable (0. 62 to 1. 01 X 10 - 4 g NMOC (dry g) - 1, suggesting that the volatilization of hazardous organic compounds is not the sole source of NMOCs in landfill gas and that anaerobic biodegradation intermediates also contribute to NMOCs...|$|R
40|$|Bioreactor {{landfills}} offer {{a sustainable}} {{way to achieve}} increased waste degradation along with benefits such as enhanced landfill gas (LFG) recovery, reduction in leachate pollution potential and rapid increase in landfill volumetric capacity. It also offers significant reduction in post closure management activities as leachate treatment, LFG {{impact on the environment}} and improves the potential for land reuse. The regulatory 30 year post-closure period is believed to account for attenuation of organics, metals and trace pollutants of adverse environmental consequences. Methodologies to improve the degradation rate and process are <b>refuse</b> <b>shredding,</b> nutrient addition, pH buffering, and temperature control along with moisture enhancement. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) settlement and field capacity are of significant beneficial interest to achieve maximum utility of landfill volume and compute water requirements for rapid degradation using bioreactor concepts.

40|$|Most of the {{problems}} with providing a continuous and sustainable energy supply for the worldwide society are negative consequences to the environment and its living habitants steaming from uses of conventional technologies. Those consequences should be minimized by developing and improving new technologies as well as by utilization of other type of feedstock than fossil fuels, such as biomass, industrial or municipal solid waste. Nowadays, gasification is the main technology for biomass conversion to energy and a great alternative for the thermal treatment of solid waste. The number of various applications for produced gas shows the flexibility of gasification and that is why allows it to be integrated with other industrial processes, as well as power generation systems.             The main objectives of this thesis were to present behavior of different kind of feedstock undergoing pyrolysis/gasification processes in reactors using highly preheated agents and additionally compare the compositions of produced gases. In this thesis two different systems were presented; the first is lab-scale gasifier for the treatment of biocoal, automotive <b>shredder</b> residue (ASR), <b>refuse</b> derived fuel (RDF), biomass (straw pellets) and plastic waste (polyethylene) and the second one is a large up-draft, fixed bed gasifier used for investigation of biocoal. The thesis was divided into four main parts: beginning with theoretical introduction, subsequently showing outcomes from investigations carried out on lab-scale test unit, large HTAG facility and finishing on short conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Metropolitan {{solid wastes}} and sewage sludges present a serious {{disposal}} problem for many communities. To assess {{the feasibility of}} disposal or utilization of these waste products on soils, a study was initiated to evaluate plant growth and soil elemental interactions on a loamy fine sand treated with metropolitan waste. <b>Shredded</b> municipal <b>refuse</b> and sewage materials were added to Sagehill loamy fine sand in both irrigated field plots and laboratory lysimeters at rates of 0, 100, 200, and 400 ton/acre and 0, 5500, 11, 000, and 22, 000 gal/acre, respectively. Ammonium sulfate fertilizer was added in 1972 to the fescue and alfalfa plots at rates of 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 lb of N/acre/year and 80, 200, 400, and 600 lb of N/acre/year, respectively. Fawn fescue and Sernac alfalfa yields were measured and soil and plant samples collected for chemical analysis. Shredded metropolitan waste and sewage sludge at rates comparable to the field study were added to plexiglass columns, ten in x three ft, packed with Sagehill loamy fine sand to simulate the natural soil profile. Nitrogen fertilizer, 240 lb N/acre/ 2 week interval, was added and the columns were either continuously, 1. 4 in/ 2 day, or intermittently, 1. 4 in/ 2 hr every 2 days, leached. Approximately the same volume of water was applied to all columns. The columns were leached for six months, allowed to dry for six months, and then leached an additional 28 days to simulate a second year of leaching. Percolation water samples were collected for chemical analysis. The concentration of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, B, P, and organic-N in the Sagehill loamy sand on the field plots and in the laboratory lysimeters increased with waste additions. The concentration of NO₃-N and NH₄-N increased mainly {{as a result of}} N fertilizer additions. The pH of the surface soil decreased to approximately 5. 0 with the addition of ammonium sulfate; however, the pH of the leachate from the soil columns remained above 7. 0 because of the carbonate accumulation in the lower portion of the soil profile. Sodium in comparison to Mg, Ca, and K leached through the soil columns most rapidly; however much of the added Na was not leached. Iron movement in the soil profile of the leaching columns related directly to a decrease in pH and the development of reducing conditions. The concentration of extractable Mn in the soil increased with the decrease in the pH of the surface soil associated with the ammonium sulfate fertilizer application. The concentration of extractable Cu, Zn, and P in the soil to the incorporation depth of the refuse was very high compared to the check soil as a result of Cu, Zn, and P additions in the waste and a decrease in pH. Very little movement of Cu, Zn, or P occurred below the incorporation depth of the refuse. The NO₃-N moved readily through the profile of the waste treated plots. Comparatively little NH₄-N moved through the profile of the field plots. The NH₄-N and NO₃-N did not appear in the leachate from the waste treated columns until after a delay of 40 - 90 days. This delay was due to the immobilization of the added nitrogen by increased microbial activity. In the second simulated year of leaching the NO₃ -N concentration of the leachate from the waste treated columns increased from a range of 0. 28 to 49 ppm at the end of year one to 18 to 400 ppm. The NO₃ -N concentration subsequently decreased rapidly to 0. 42 to 43 ppm with additional water application. Data from the field plots most closely paralleled the data from the intermittently leached columns while the continuously leached columns represented a more extreme environment particularly with regard to the reducing conditions that developed in them. Unless strong reducing conditions occurred in the profile, NO₃-N was the only ion studied which posed an apparent threat to ground water quality. Land application of municipal refuse at levels less than 400 ton/acre is a suitable method of disposal. The optimum rate appeared to be 100 ton/acre. At this rate the refuse was easily incorporated into the soil, plant elemental uptake problems were minimal, and unfavorable chemical changes such as the development of reducing conditions in the 400 ton/acre refuse treated plots did not generally occur...|$|R
