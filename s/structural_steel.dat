5|$|The Blackstone is a 22-floor {{rectangular}} {{structure and}} its <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> frame is cased in tile and plaster fireproofing. On the exterior {{south and east}} (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and terra cotta-trimmed building shaft. Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed terra cotta. The large windows of {{the second and third}} floor, which once poured natural light into the lobby, ballroom, and restaurants, have mostly been covered for a theater. The majority of the building rises as a 12-story shaft of red brick dotted with white, terra cotta window surrounds; above this section is a belt course of terra cotta and two stories of red brick. Above this, the original design included an intermediate terra cotta cornice topped by a cast-iron railing. This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white glazed brick, flush {{with the rest of the}} building. The mansard roof was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter, and 2 very tall flagpoles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a {{statistical}} estimation method of S-N curve for iron and <b>structural</b> <b>steels</b> by using their static mechanical properties. In this study, firstly, the S-N data for pure iron and <b>structural</b> <b>steels</b> were extracted from "Database on fatigue strength of Metallic Materials" published by the Society of Materials Science, Japan (JSMS) and S-N curve regression model was applied based on the JSMS standard, "Standard Evaluation Method of Fatigue Reliability for Metallic Materials-Standard Regression Method of S-N Curve-". Secondly, correlations between regression parameters and static mechanical properties were investigated. As a result, the relationship between the regression parameters and static mechanical properties (e. g. fatigue limit E and static tensile strength σB) showed strong correlations, respectively. Using these correlations, it is revealed that S-N curve for iron and <b>structural</b> <b>steels</b> can be predicted easily from the static mechanical properties...|$|R
5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and <b>structural</b> <b>steel</b> members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E

40|$|Aceh {{province}} {{located at}} the northwestern tip of Sumatra Island in Indonesia has a coastal environment and a coastline of around 1660 km. Banda Aceh, Aceh Besar, and Aceh Barat are among the districts of Aceh Province located on those coastlines. The earthquake and tsunami that struck Aceh in December 2004 caused much of these districts to be submerged by seawater. Thus, the environment of these areas might become more corrosive. This study investigates atmospheric corrosion of <b>structural</b> <b>steels</b> exposed to the environment by the 2004 tsunami. Some typical <b>structural</b> <b>steels,</b> which have five different shapes, were selected for the test. Atmospheric corrosion tests were employed by referring to ASTM G 50 standards. Eight locations were selected as the test sites: Peukan Bada, Ulee Lheu, Lingke, Lampulo, Suak Ribee, Suak Pandan, Suak Seuke, and Suak Geudebang. Following a six-month exposure, experimental {{results show that the}} atmospheric corrosion rate for Peukan Bada, Ulee Lheu, Lingke, Lampulo, Suak Ribee, Suak Pandan, Suak Seuke, and Suak Geudebang was 0. 043 – 5. 451 mpy, 0. 035 – 3. 804 mpy, 0. 058 – 5. 332 mpy, 0. 045 – 9. 727 mpy, 0. 265 – 3. 957 mpy, 0. 073 – 2. 970 mpy, 0. 090 – 4. 101 mpy, and 0. 380 – 6. 379 mpy, respectively. The results show that the relative corrosion resistances for all <b>structural</b> <b>steels</b> exposed in these areas can be categorized as good to outstanding.
