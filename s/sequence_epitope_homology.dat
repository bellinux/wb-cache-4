The antibody was also found to react with smooth muscle of frozen sections of human stomach tissue by immunofluorescence, and with the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Anti-Ab immunotherapy is a promising and advanced therapeutic strategy, but the precise Ab species to target {{is not yet}} known. Previously, we and others have shown that natural human IgGs (NAbs) target diverse Ab conformers and have therapeutic potential. We now demonstrate that these antibodies bound with nM avidity to conformational epitopes on plate-immobilized synthetic Ab dimer assemblies, including synaptotoxic protofibrils, and targeted these conformers in solution. Importantly, NAbs also recognized Ab extracted from the water-soluble phase of human AD brain, including species that migrated on denaturing PAGE as SDS-stable dimers. The critical reliance on Ab’s conformational state for NAb binding, and not a linear <b>sequence</b> <b>epitope,</b> was confirmed by the antibody’s nM reactivity with plate-immobilized protofibrills, and weak uM binding to synthetic Ab monomers and peptide fragments. The antibody’s lack of reactivity against a linear <b>sequence</b> <b>epitope</b> was confirmed by our ability to isolate anti-Ab NAbs from intravenous immunoglobulin using affinity matrices, immunoglobulin light chain fibrils and Cibacron blue, which had no sequence similarity with the peptide.

40|$|Molecular mimicry of viral antigens with self {{determinants}} {{has been}} proposed {{as one of the}} pathogenic mechanisms in autoimmune disease. Evidence of viral mimicry in animal models of autoimmunity is accumulating. Murine adenovirus, Semliki forest virus, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, herpes simplex virus type- 1, hepatitis B virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus, Coxsackievirus and cytomegalovirus have been found to mimic physiologically important host proteins. However, <b>epitope</b> <b>homology</b> of a viral and self determinant is not in itself strong evidence for mimicry as a pathogenic mechanism.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Analysis of IgE {{antibody}} binding to epitopes {{provides information}} for food allergy diagnosis and management {{and construction of}} hypoallergenic candidate vaccines, but the contribution of sequential epitopes to functionally relevant IgE binding is not fully understood. OBJECTIVES: We sought to study the impact of IgE-binding peptides described as major <b>sequence</b> <b>epitopes</b> {{in the literature on}} IgE-binding capacity of 2 selected food allergens. METHODS: IgE-binding peptides of the food allergens Ara h 2 (peanut) and Pen a 1 (shrimp) were identified. Synthetic soluble peptides representing the identified sequences were assessed for their capacity to inhibit IgE binding to the parent allergens by means of ELISA and in mediator release assay. The IgE-binding capacity of unfolded recombinant (r) Ara h 2 was analyzed. A hybrid tropomyosin carrying the IgE-binding regions of Pen a 1 grafted into the structural context of the nonallergenic mouse tropomyosin was applied in ELISA inhibition experiments and ImmunoCAP analysis. RESULTS: Although IgE-binding peptides representing sections of the allergen sequences were detected, no relevant capacity to inhibit the IgE binding to the parent allergen in ELISA or basophil activation test was observed. Unfolded rAra h 2 showed reduced IgE-binding capacity compared with folded rAra h 2 and failed to elicit mediator release. Hybrid tropomyosin bound less IgE than rPen a 1 in ImmunoCAP analysis and revealed marginal inhibitory capacity. CONCLUSION: Peptides identified as major <b>sequence</b> <b>epitopes</b> on Pen a 1 and Ara h 2 show little contribution to the IgE binding of the allergens studied...|$|R

To {{establish}} more clearly the nature of the renin-containing cells in the placental membranes, double immunostaining techniques were used to stain renin and specific cell markers in the same tissue sections. Cytokeratin was selected as an ectodermal cell marker and CD 68 as a cytoplasmic macrophage marker. Cross-binding between antibodies was prevented by blocking species-related binding sites {{between the first and second}} sequence of the double-immunostaining procedures and by using highly selective immunostaining techniques in the second sequence. The results clearly show renin immunostaining in CD 68 -positive macrophages and not in cytokeratin-positive trophoblast. The anti-renal renin monoclonal antibody showed high affinity cross-reactivity with cathepsin D, another aspartic proteinase that can release angiotensin I from angiotensinogen. This should be seen in the context of earlier findings that only two of four anti-renal renin monoclonal antibodies showed staining in uterine and placental tissues and both cross-reacted with cathepsin D.

Even though the exact cause of T 1 DM {{is yet to be}} ascertained, varying degree of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors have been linked to the disease progress and outcome. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is an obligate zoonotic pathogen that causes chronic infection of intestines in ruminants, the Johne's disease. MAP that can even survive pasteurization and chlorination has also been implicated to cause similar type of enteritis in humans called Crohn's disease.

40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), an oncogenic human herpesvirus, binds to and infects {{normal human}} B {{lymphocytes}} via CD 21, the CR 2 complement receptor. Studies of the mechanisms that enable EBV to infect nonactivated, noncycling B cells provide compelling {{evidence for a}} sequence of events in which EBV binding to CD 21 on purified resting human B cells rapidly activates the NF-�B transcription factor, which, in turn, binds to and mediates transcriptional activation of Wp, the initial viral latent gene promoter. Thus, EBV binding to its cellular receptor on resting B cells triggers an NF-�B–dependent intracellular signaling pathway which is required for infection. Infection of normal human B lymphocytes by EBV, a ubiquitous transforming human herpesvirus with oncogenic potential, is initiated by binding of the virus to CD 21 (CR 2, complement receptor type 2), the receptor for C 3 dg, the terminal activation/processing fragment of the third complement component (1, 2).

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) mutates to escape immune selection pressure, {{but there is}} little evidence of selection mediated through HLA-A 2, the dominant class I allele in persons infected with clade B virus. Moreover, HLA-A 2 -restricted responses are largely absent in the acute phase of infection as the viral load is being reduced, suggesting that circulating viruses may lack immunodominant epitopes targeted through HLA-A 2. Here we demonstrate an A 2 -restricted epitope within Vpr (Vpr 59 - 67) that is targeted by acute-phase HIV- 1 -specific CD 8 + T cells, but only in a subset of persons expressing HLA-A 2. Individuals in the acute stage of infection with viruses containing the most common current <b>sequence</b> within this <b>epitope</b> (consensus <b>sequence)</b> were unable to mount epitope-specific T-cell responses, whereas subjects infected with the less frequent I 60 L variant all developed these responses.

The antigenic phosphoepitope, designated the MPM- 2 epitope, putatively consists of hydrophobic residue-Thr/Ser-Pro-hydrophobic residue-uncharged/basic residue. In this study, we addressed whether this sequence motif contains all the information necessary for recognition and phosphorylation by the kinase that phosphorylates most MPM- 2 antigens. A fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase and a 19 -residue peptide that contained two representative MPM- 2 <b>epitope</b> <b>sequences</b> overlapping with two potential MAP kinase phosphorylation sites was constructed. Both the MPM- 2 <b>epitope</b> <b>sequences</b> in the fusion protein (GST-MPM 2) were phosphorylated by Xenopus egg extract, making the fusion protein MPM- 2 reactive. However, while MAP kinase phosphorylated both the MPM- 2 <b>epitope</b> <b>sequences,</b> neither ME kinase-H, {{a good candidate for}} a major MPM- 2 epitope kinase, nor mitotic cdc 2 kinase, which is known to phosphorylate certain MPM- 2 antigens in vitro, phosphorylated GST-MPM 2 to any significant extent. Furthermore, depletion of MAP kinase activity removed most, if not all, of the GST-MPM 2 phosphorylating activity from crude Xenopus egg extracts. These results suggest that additional or different structural information than that provided by the deduced MPM- 2 <b>epitope</b> <b>sequence</b> is required for recognition and phosphorylation by ME kinase-H or other major MPM- 2 epitope kinases.

The linear <b>sequence</b> <b>epitope</b> reactivity of affinity purified polyclonal antibodies to recombinant human α-glucosidase and α-l-iduronidase was defined, to both glycosidases.

In a previous study, in MPS I patients who developed an immune response to ERT, this same site on α-l-iduronidase was highly antigenic and the last to tolerise following repeated enzyme infusions.

We have developed a methodology by which CD 4 + T cells acquire apoptosis-inducing properties on antigen-presenting cells after cognate recognition of natural <b>sequence</b> <b>epitopes.</b> We describe here that inclusion of a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase (thioreductase) motif within the flanking residues of a single MHC class II-restricted GAD 65 epitope induces GAD 65 -specific cytolytic CD 4 + T cells (cCD 4 + T). The latter, obtained either in vitro or by active immunization, acquire an effector memory phenotype and lyse APCs by a Fas-FasL interaction. Further, cCD 4 + T cells eliminate by apoptosis activated bystander CD 4 + T cells recognizing alternative epitopes processed by the same APC. Active immunization with a GAD 65 class II-restricted thioreductase-containing T cell epitope protects mice from diabetes and abrogates insulitis.

However, because of limitations {{in the numbers}} of viral sequences that can be sampled, traditional sequencing technologies have not provided a true representation of the plasticity of these viruses or the intensity of CD 8 + T lymphocyte-mediated selection pressure. Moreover, the strategy by which CD 8 + T lymphocytes contain evolving viral quasispecies has not been characterized fully. In the present study we have employed ultradeep 454 pyrosequencing of virus and simultaneous staining of CD 8 + T lymphocytes with multiple tetramers in the SIV/rhesus monkey model to explore the coevolution of virus and the cellular immune response during primary infection. We demonstrated that cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) -mediated selection pressure on the infecting virus was manifested by epitope mutations as early as 21 days following infection. We also showed that CD 8 + T lymphocytes cross-recognized wild-type and mutant epitopes and that these cross-reactive cell populations were present at a time when mutant forms of virus were present at frequencies of as low as 1 in 22, 000 sequenced clones. Surprisingly, these cross-reactive cells became enriched in the epitope-specific CD 8 + T lymphocyte population as viruses with mutant <b>epitope</b> <b>sequences</b> largely replaced those with <b>epitope</b> <b>sequences</b> of the transmitted virus.

Methods All patients had been enrolled in a WT 1 peptide phase II vaccination trial (NCT 00153582) and ultimately progressed despite induction of a WT 1 specific T cell response. Blood and bone marrow samples prior to vaccination and during progression were analyzed for mRNA expression level of WT 1. Base exchanges within the <b>epitope</b> <b>sequence</b> or flanking regions (10 amino acids N- and C-terminal of the epitope) were assessed with melting point analysis and sequencing. HLA class I expression and WT 1 protein expression was analyzed by flow cytometry.

FINDINGS: Before enzyme-replacement therapy, all patients had low serum antibody titres to recombinant human alpha-L-iduronidase that were within the control range. Five of the ten patients produced higher-than-normal titres of antibody to the replacement protein during the treatment course (serum antibody titres 130000 - 500000 and high-affinity epitope reactivity).

We conclude that glycosidases can exhibit cross-reactive epitopes, and infer that this may relate to common structural elements associated with their active sites.

40|$|Endo-N-acylneuraminidase (endo-N) is a phage-encoded depolymerase that degrades {{the alpha}} (2 - 8) -linked polysialic acid chains of K 1 serotypes of Escherichia coli and {{vertebrate}} neural cell adhesion molecules. We have determined the DNA {{sequence of the}} bacteriophage K 1 F tail protein structural gene, which codes for a polypeptide of 920 residues. Purification of the tail protein yields a 102 -kDa species upon denaturing gel electrophoresis and detection by Western immunoblot analysis. An identical polypeptide was detected by Western blot analysis of K 1 F virions. Peptide sequencing confirmed that the open reading frame determined by nucleotide sequencing encodes endo-N. Immunoelectron microscopy with neutralizing antibodies raised against the depolymerase confirmed that endo-N is {{a component of the}} K 1 F tail apparatus. Antibodies in the serum cross-reacted with endo-N from another K 1 -specific phage, PK 1 E, demonstrating the presence of shared <b>epitopes.</b> <b>Homology</b> between K 1 F and PK 1 E endo-N was confirmed by Southern, Northern (RNA), and Western blot analyses. The endo-N amino-terminal domain is homologous to the amino termini of phage T 7 and T 3 tail proteins, indicating by analogy that this domain functions in attachment of endo-N to the K 1 F virion's head. A central domain of 495 residues has weak similarity to sea urchin aryl sulfatase, suggesting that this region may contain the endo-N catalytic site. Failure to detect homology between the PK 1 E homolog and the carboxy-terminal domain of K 1 F endo-N is consistent with the central domain's involvement in binding and catalysis of polysialic acid. These results provide the initial molecular and genetic description of polysialic acid depolymerase, which has so far been detected only in K 1 -specific phage...|$|R

40|$|FluKB is a {{knowledge-based}} system focusing on data and analytical tools for influenza vaccine discovery. The main goal of FluKB {{is to provide}} access to curated influenza <b>sequence</b> and <b>epitope</b> data and enhance the analysis of influenza sequence diversity and the analysis of targets of immune responses. FluKB consists of more than 400, 000 influenza protein <b>sequences,</b> known <b>epitope</b> data (357 verified T-cell epitopes, 685 HLA binders, and 16 naturally processed MHC ligands), and a collection of 28 influenza antibodies and their structurally defined B-cell epitopes. FluKB was built using a modular framework allowing the implementation of analytical workflows and includes standard search tools, such as keyword search and sequence similarity queries, as well as advanced tools for the analysis of sequence variability. The advanced analytical tools for vaccine discovery include visual mapping of T- and B-cell vaccine targets and assessment of neutralizing antibody coverage. FluKB supports the discovery of vaccine targets and the analysis of viral diversity and its implications for vaccine discovery as well as potential T-cell breadth and antibody cross neutralization involving multiple strains. FluKB is representation {{of a new generation of}} databases that integrates data, analytical tools, and analytical workflows that enable comprehensive analysis and automatic generation of analysis reports.

40|$|Conformation-specific {{antibodies}} that recognize aggregated proteins {{associated with}} several conformational disorders (e. g., Parkinson and prion diseases) are invaluable for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. However, no systematic strategy exists for generating conformation-specific antibodies that target linear <b>sequence</b> <b>epitopes</b> within misfolded proteins. Here we report {{a strategy for}} designing conformation- and sequence-specific antibodies against misfolded proteins that is inspired by the molecular interactions governing protein aggregation. We find that grafting small amyloidogenic peptides (6 – 10 residues) from the Aβ 42 peptide associated with Alzheimer’s disease into the complementarity determining regions of a domain (VH) antibody generates antibody variants that recognize Aβ soluble oligomers and amyloid fibrils with nanomolar affinity. We refer to these antibodies as gammabodies for grafted amyloid-motif antibodies. Gammabodies displaying the central amyloidogenic Aβ motif () are reactive with Aβ fibrils, whereas those displaying the amyloidogenic C terminus () are reactive with Aβ fibrils and oligomers (and weakly reactive with Aβ monomers). Importantly, {{we find that the}} grafted motifs target the corresponding peptide segments within misfolded Aβ conformers. Aβ gammabodies fail to cross-react with other amyloidogenic proteins and scrambling their grafted sequences eliminates antibody reactivity. Finally, gammabodies that recognize Aβ soluble oligomers and fibrils also neutralize the toxicity of each Aβ conformer. We expect that our antibody design strategy is not limited to Aβ and can be used to readily generate gammabodies against other toxic misfolded proteins...|$|R
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent {{membrane}} protein (LMP) 2 is a multiple membrane spanning molecule which lacks ectodomains projecting into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Human CD 8 � cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) s recognize {{a number of}} epitopes within LMP 2. Assays with epitope-specific CTLs in two different cell backgrounds lacking the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) consistently show that some, but not all, LMP 2 epitopes are presented in a TAP-independent manner. However, unlike published examples of TAP-independent processing from endogenously expressed antigens, presentation of TAP-independent LMP 2 epitopes was abrogated by inhibition of proteasomal activity. We found a clear correlation between hydrophobicity of the LMP 2 <b>epitope</b> <b>sequence</b> and TAP independence, and experiments with vaccinia minigene constructs expressing cytosolic epitope peptides confirmed that these more hydrophobic peptides were selectively able to access the HLA class I pathway in TAP-negative cells. Furthermore, the TAP-independent phenotype of particular <b>epitope</b> <b>sequences</b> did not require membrane location of the source antigen since (i) TAP-independent LMP 2 epitopes inserted into an EBV nuclear antigen and (ii) hydrophobic <b>epitope</b> <b>sequences</b> native to EBV nuclear antigens were both presented in TAP-negative cells. We infer {{that there is a}} proteasome-dependent, TAP-independent pathway of antigen presentation which hydrophobic epitopes can selectively access.

40|$|AbstractThe conserved, aromatic-rich membrane-proximal {{external}} region (MPER) of gp 41 is functional {{in human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -cell fusion by perturbing membrane integrity. Broadly-neutralizing 2 F 5 and 4 E 10 monoclonal antibodies (MAb-s) recognize amino- and carboxy-terminal <b>epitope</b> <b>sequences</b> within this domain, respectively. An MPER peptide overlapping 2 F 5 and 4 E 10 <b>epitope</b> <b>sequences</b> was capable of breaching the permeability barrier of lipid vesicles. Cholesterol and sphingomyelin raft-lipids, present at high quantities in the HIV- 1 envelope, promoted exposure or occlusion of 4 E 10 epitope, respectively. Conversely, 2 F 5 epitope accessibility was affected {{to a lesser extent}} by these envelope lipids. These observations support the idea that MPER epitopes on membranes are segmented in terms of how they are affected by envelope lipids, which may have implications for MPER-based vaccine development...|$|R
