5|$|Depending on {{the species}} {{and where it}} lives, the larva either conceals itself under leaves, debris or pieces of wood, hides in a crack or digs a funnel-shaped pit in loose material. As ambush predators, {{catching}} prey is risky because food arrives unpredictably and, for those species that make traps, maintaining one is costly; the larvae therefore have low metabolic rates and can <b>survive</b> <b>for</b> long periods without food. They can take several years to complete their life-cycle; they mature faster with plentiful food, but can <b>survive</b> <b>for</b> many months without feeding. In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter.|$|E

5|$|Although not as {{significant}} as deforestation and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs and other species that have successfully been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as exotic pets by Malagasy people. Bamboo lemurs are also kept as pets, although they only <b>survive</b> <b>for</b> up to two months. Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.|$|E

5|$|Active {{during the}} night, Transandinomys talamancae {{lives on the}} ground and eats plants and insects. Males move more and have larger home ranges than females. It breeds {{throughout}} the year, but few individuals <b>survive</b> <b>for</b> more than a year. After a gestation period of about 28 days, two to five young are born, which reach sexual maturity within two months. A variety of parasites occur on this species.

5|$|An early-war Army {{anti-aircraft}} company (Flugabwehr-Kompanie) {{was organized}} in three platoons {{with a total}} of eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/4s, twelve with guns and six carrying ammunition. When the four-barrel 2 cm Flakvierling 38 was fielded in 1941 each platoon had four Sd.Kfz. 10/4s towing the guns and another for ammunition. Later these companies were reorganized {{with a total of}} eight Sd.Kfz. 10/4s carrying guns, two towing Flakvierlings and three carrying ammunition. These are just examples of some of the Army organizations which differed depending on the unit and the period. Sd.Kfz. 10/5s were substituted for 10/4s on a one for one basis. Detailed records do not <b>survive</b> <b>for</b> the Luftwaffe light anti-aircraft units, but they appear to have been organized into batteries of nine or twelve guns.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{the shallow}} reef {{platforms}} inhabited by the epaulette shark often become {{isolated from the}} ocean by the receding tide. The amount of dissolved oxygen in the pool can drop 80% or more overnight from the combined respiration of all the organisms within the pool. The epaulette shark has evolved to cope with these hypoxic conditions, being able to <b>survive</b> <b>for</b> over three hours in 5% of the atmospheric O2 level without losing behavioral responsiveness. In the laboratory, epaulette sharks have survived for an hour without any oxygen at 30°C (86°F), which is also unusual in that most animals capable of tolerating oxygen deprivation do so at low temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Breathing air is {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers <b>survive</b> <b>for</b> much longer, in some cases in water that {{is little more than}} wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease.

A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can <b>survive</b> <b>for</b> extended periods outside a host.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{how long}} Surtsey will survive {{are based on the}} rate of erosion seen up to the present day. Assuming that the current rate does not change, the island will be mostly at or below sea level by 2100. However, the rate of erosion is likely to slow as the tougher core of the island is exposed: an {{assessment}} assuming that the rate of erosion will slow exponentially suggests that the island will <b>survive</b> <b>for</b> many centuries. An idea of what it will look like in the future is given by the other small islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, which formed {{in the same way as}} Surtsey several thousand years ago, and have eroded away substantially since they were formed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Hepatic {{angiosarcoma}} (HAS) is rare {{but often}} fatal. A {{review of literature}} in 1979 found that only 3 % of the 70 patients lived for more than 2 years, but the survival might have been improved over the years. We conducted a retrospective study and reviewed the medical records of patients who visited a teaching hospital in Taiwan from January 2000 to August 2010 and had pathological proof of HAS. In addition, we conducted a review of literature and compared those who <b>survived</b> <b>for</b> 2 years or more {{to those who did}} not. Of the 3503 patients with primary liver cancer we identified, 9 had HAS, of whom 3 (33. 3 %) <b>survived</b> <b>for</b> 2 years or more. One <b>survived</b> <b>for</b> 24 months without surgical resection, and the other two received surgery with postoperative chemotherapy and were still alive 32 and 37 months later, respectively. Through reviewing literature, we identified 3 more patients in Taiwan who had <b>survived</b> <b>for</b> 2 years or more. One <b>survived</b> <b>for</b> 42 months without surgical resection, the other two received segmentectomy with postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. We also identified 8 such cases outside Taiwan, including 1 who received chemotherapy without surgery an clinical ch 2 years o believe th be able to and it is alone. (Medicin...|$|R

5|$|Examination of M87 at far {{infrared}} wavelengths shows an excess emission at wavelengths longer than 25μm. Normally such emission {{may be an}} indication of thermal emission by warm dust. However, {{in the case of}} M87, the emission appears to be fully explained by synchrotron radiation from the jet. Within the galaxy, silicate grains are expected to <b>survive</b> <b>for</b> no more than 46million years because of the X-ray emission from the core. This dust may be destroyed by the hostile environment or expelled from the galaxy. The combined mass of dust in this galaxy is no more than 70,000 times the mass of the Sun. By comparison, the Milky Way contains about a hundred million (108) solar masses worth of dust.|$|E
5|$|Of {{all people}} with lung {{cancer in the}} US, 16.8% <b>survive</b> <b>for</b> {{at least five years}} after diagnosis. In England and Wales, between 2010 and 2011, overall five-year {{survival}} for lung cancer was estimated at 9.5%. Outcomes are generally worse in the developing world. Stage is often advanced at the time of diagnosis. At presentation, 30–40% of cases of NSCLC are stage IV, and 60% of SCLC are stage IV. Survival for lung cancer falls as the stage at diagnosis becomes more advanced: the English data suggest that around 70% of patients survive at least a year when diagnosed at the earliest stage, but this falls to just 14% for those diagnosed with the most advanced disease.|$|E

5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} rain, has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. All plants {{need at least}} some water to survive, therefore rain (being {{the most effective means}} of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, {{too much or too little}} rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to <b>survive.</b> <b>For</b> example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.|$|E
5|$|Several {{features}} of the tooth are only known {{from members of the}} family Dromaeosauridae of theropod dinosaurs. Dromaeosauroides was classified {{as a member of the}} Dromaeosaurinae subfamily within the Dromaeosauridae, due to its similarity to Dromaeosaurus. Despite the resemblance, Dromaeosauroides is not considered part of that genus. It is unlikely that a genus would <b>survive</b> <b>for</b> 60million years; Dromaeosauroides lived during the Early Cretaceous, and Dromaeosaurus during the Late Cretaceous. The differences between their denticles also indicate they should be kept separate.|$|E
