60|$|If {{then the}} promise of America were {{in the fact that}} she is one of the latest births of progress, we <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> it is exactly the latest born that were the first to die. If in this sense she is praised as young, it may be {{answered}} that the young have died young, and have not lived to be old. And if this be confused with the argument that she came in an age of clarity and scepticism, uncontaminated by old superstitions, it could still be retorted that the works of superstition have survived the works of scepticism. But the truth is, of course, that the real quality of America is much more subtle and complex than this; and is mixed not only of good and bad, and rational and mystical, but also of old and new. That is what makes the task of tracing the true proportions of American life so interesting and so impossible.|$|E

"My idea is this: that {{we should}} load up all your camels with closely-pressed bundles of forage; then {{that we should}} advance a day's march across the desert; and there that we should form a zareba. With the forage we should, of course, take water-skins with us, with {{sufficient}} to last {{for at least a}} week. I should send the camels back again as soon as they are unloaded, and should order those who remained behind to load all their goods upon them and to set out either for the other douar of your tribe or for the villages to the south. I should send a messenger to the other douar to say {{that we are going to}} defend the zareba to the last and praying them to come at once to our rescue, promising the moment they appear to sally out and fall upon the dervishes while they attack them in rear. Your messenger <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> before they arrive a number of the enemy will certainly have fallen in their attack upon us, and we shall, therefore, be decidedly superior to them in point of numbers." ...|$|E
60|$|This morning wet and surly. Sallied, however, by the {{assistance}} of a hired coach, and left cards for Count Pozzo di Borgo, Lord Granville, our ambassador, and M. Gallois, author of the History of Venice.[382] Found no one at home, not even the old pirate Galignani,[383] at whose den I ventured to call. Showed my companion the Louvre (which was closed, unluckily), the front of the palace with its courts, and all that splendid quarter which the fame of Paris rests upon in security. We can never do the like in Britain. Royal magnificence can only be displayed by despotic power. In England, were the most splendid street or public building to be erected, the matter must be discussed in Parliament, or perhaps some sturdy cobbler holds out, and refuses to part with his stall, and the whole plan is disconcerted. Long may such impediments exist! But then we should conform to circumstances, and assume in our public works a certain sober simplicity of character, which <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> they were dictated by utility rather than show. The affectation of an expensive style only places us at a disadvantageous contrast with other nations, and our substitute of brick and plaster for freestone resembles the mean ambition which displays Bristol stones in default of diamonds.|$|E

6000|$|At {{this point}} the candid reader may perhaps ask what {{advantage}} is gained by presenting these poems to modern readers in the dress of a bygone age. If the question were put to me I should probably evade it {{by pointing out that}} Mr. Frowde is issuing an edition based upon this, in which the spelling is frankly that of to-day. But if the question were pressed, I think a sufficient answer might be found. To begin with, I <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> even Prof. Masson, who in his excellent edition argues the point and decides in favour of modern spelling, allows that there are peculiarities of Milton's spelling which are really significant, and ought therefore to be noted or preserved. But who is to determine exactly which words are spelt according to the poet's own instructions, and which according to the printer's whim? It is notorious that in Paradise Lost some words were spelt upon a deliberate system, and it may very well happen that in the volume of minor poems which the poet saw through the press in 1645, there were spellings no less systematic. Prof. Masson makes a great point of the fact that Milton's own spelling, exhibited in the autograph manuscript of some of the minor poems preserved in Trinity College, Cambridge, does not correspond with that of the printed copy. [Note: This manuscript, invaluable to all students of Milton, has lately been facsimiled under the superintendence of Dr. Aldis Wright, and published at the Cambridge University press]. This is certainly true, as the reader may see for himself by comparing the passage from the manuscript given in the appendix with the corresponding place in the text. Milton's own spelling revels in redundant e's, while the printer of the 1645 book is very sparing of them. But in cases where the spelling affects the metre, we find that the printed text and Milton's manuscript closely correspond; and it is upon its value in determining the metre, quite as much as its antiquarian interest, that I should base a justification of this reprint. Take, for instance, such a line as the eleventh of Comus, which Prof. Masson gives as:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Another {{obstacle}} to a pacific solution, perhaps most formidable of them all, was Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, the British ambassador at Constantinople. Animated by a vehement antipathy to Russia, possessing almost sovereign ascendency at the Porte, {{believing that the}} Turk might never meet a happier chance of having the battle out with his adversary once for all, and justly confident that a policy of war would find hearty backers in the London cabinet--in him the government had an agent who while seeming to follow instructions in the narrow letter baffled them in their spirit. In the autumn of 1853 Lord Aberdeen wrote to Graham, 'I fear I must renounce the sanguine view I have hitherto taken of the Eastern question; for nothing can be more alarming than the present prospect. I thought {{that we should have}} been able to conquer Stratford, but I begin to fear that the reverse will be the case, and that he will succeed in defeating us. Although at our wit's end, Clarendon and I are still labouring in the cause of peace; but really to contend at once with the pride of the Emperor, the fanaticism of the Turks, and the dishonesty of Stratford is almost a hopeless attempt.'[303] This description, when he saw it nearly forty years later, seems to have struck Mr. Gladstone as harsh. Though he agreed that the passage could hardly be omitted, he confessed his surprise that Lord Aberdeen should have applied the word dishonesty to Lord Stratford. He suggested the addition of a note that should recognise the general character of Lord Stratford, and <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> prejudice and passion, by their blinding powers, often produce in the mind effects like those proper to dishonesty.[304] Perhaps we may find this a hard saying. Doubtless when he comes to praise and blame, the political historian must make due allowance for his actors; and charity is the grandest of illuminants. Still hard truth stands first, and amiable analysis of the psychology of a diplomatic agent who lets loose a flood of mischief on mankind is by no means what interests us most about him. Why not call things by their right names?[305] ...|$|E

50|$|The northeastern Iberian script, {{also known}} as Levantine Iberian or Iberian because the Iberian script was the most {{frequently}} used, was the main means of written expression of the Iberian language.

[...] He again applauded Gex's unique wall climbing ability, the vast size and numerous secrets of the levels, and Dana Gould's numerous one-liners. He remarked the Saturn version has [...] "the same graphics, sound, and control that earned acclaim in the PlayStation version", and that [...] "Gex eats Bug for lunch". A reviewer for Next Generation contested that Gex's wall climbing ability is [...] "not completely unique" [...] but that it nonetheless adds an interesting dimension to the gameplay, and also praised Gould's one-liners and the [...] "unique and humorous" [...] area themes. He concluded, [...] "In a world of polygons, we're not sure one last side-scroller is what the 32-bit universe needs, but you could do worse." [...] In a rare negative review of the game, Rob Allsetter commented in Sega Saturn Magazine, [...] "I suppose I <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the graphics and animation are polished, that the game moves at a decent pace and that it's certainly playable, but ... {{none of these things}} make up for the utter predictability of it all."
