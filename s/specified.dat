5|$|Cylinder working {{pressure}} is <b>specified</b> at a reference temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} <b>specified</b> maximum safe working temperature, often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the <b>specified</b> {{working pressure}} stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the <b>specified</b> working pressure when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the reference temperature.|$|E

5|$|The ascent is {{made at the}} {{recommended}} rate until the diver reaches {{the depth of the}} first stop.

5|$|An aspect weaver is a metaprogramming utility for aspect-oriented {{languages}} {{designed to}} take instructions <b>specified</b> by aspects (isolated representations of a significant concepts in a program) and generate the final implementation code. The weaver integrates aspects into the locations <b>specified</b> by the software as a pre-compilation step.

5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} to construct all the circles that intersect three given circles at a precise angle θ, or at three <b>specified</b> crossing angles θ1, θ2 and θ3; the ordinary Apollonius' problem corresponds to a special {{case in which the}} crossing angle is zero for all three given circles.

The SSEM's single operand architecture meant that the second operand of any operation was implicit: the accumulator or the program counter (instruction address); program instructions <b>specified</b> only {{the address of the}} data in memory.|$|E
5|$|Earmarking is a {{requirement}} that specifies a limit amount or percentage of the program’s assistance that must (minimum) or may (maximum) be used for <b>specified</b> activities.
