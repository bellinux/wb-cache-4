25|$|Siddhaṃ is an abugida or alphasyllabary {{rather than}} an {{alphabet}} because each character indicates a syllable. If no other mark occurs then the short 'a' is assumed.

This he said not from any design upon her, {{but for her}} own safety and honour, that she might not be exposed to danger or disgrace, by {{returning}} home at such an unseasonable time of night. The Hebrew letter נ [...] "nun" [...] in the word ליני lî-nî for [...] "tarry" [...] is larger than usual in the Hebrew text; which may be done to raise {{the attention of the}} reader, to observe it as a thing very singular, that a widow should lodge with a man without any diminution of her chastity; so Buxtorf says, that hereby attention is noted, even the honesty of Boaz ordering Ruth to lodge without a man, and wait until a nearer kinsman, according to the law, should come, and promising that on failure thereof he would be the lawful redeemer. But Dr. Lightfoot observes, that as there is a <b>special</b> <b>mark</b> over a word in the story of Lot's eldest daughter lying with her father (a dot above the letter י [...] "yod" [...] of last Hebrew word in Lot's eldest daughter gave birth to Moab, the progenitor of Ruth's tribe) and a <b>special</b> <b>mark</b> on this word here, in the story of Ruth going to Boaz his bed, seems to relate one to the other, and both together to point at the great providence of God in bringing light out of darkness, Ruth, a (fore)mother of Jesus Christ, out of the incest of Lot.|$|E

50|$|A <b>special</b> {{registration}} <b>mark</b> {{obtained in}} an auction is not transferable, {{that is to}} say, the number can be used only on vehicles registered {{under the name of}} the buyer. Transferring a <b>special</b> registration <b>mark</b> from one vehicle to another is permitted provided that they are both owned by the same person. Sale or transfer of vehicles bearing a <b>special</b> registration <b>mark</b> to someone else would lose that <b>special</b> registration <b>mark.</b> If the buyer is assigned the <b>special</b> registration <b>mark</b> to a vehicle, and later dies, the <b>special</b> registration <b>mark</b> cannot be transferred together with the vehicle to his heirs. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} consider in whose name one should buy a <b>special</b> registration <b>mark</b> in an auction. The use of a limited liability company as the buyer gets around the non-transferrable restriction because of its perpetual succession and the ability to transfer the company shares.|$|R

40|$|This study investigates construction-level {{effects of}} animacy for Agents {{in a set}} of Australian languages. It is shown that the {{presence}} of an inanimate Agent can not only affect the marking of the Agent, but also the marking of the verb and of the Undergoer. On the basis of a detailed study of the extent of these effects in specific languages, it is shown that they are not always directly related to animacy, but can also be related to factors that are typically but not exclusively associated with animacy, like unusual instigation and unusual affectedness. It is also shown that there is a correlation between the part of the construction that is affected, and the type of motivation. <b>Special</b> <b>marking</b> of the Agent tends to be a direct animacy effect, while <b>special</b> <b>marking</b> of verbal transitivity is an effect of unusual instigation, and <b>special</b> <b>marking</b> of the Undergoer is an effect of unusual affectedness. status: publishe...|$|R
