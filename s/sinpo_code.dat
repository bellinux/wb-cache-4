5000|$|<b>SINPO</b> <b>code</b> - code used to {{describe}} the quality of radio transmissions, especially in reception reports written by shortwave listeners ...|$|E
50|$|Generally, a <b>SINPO</b> with a <b>code</b> number {{starting}} with a 2 or lower would not be worth reporting, unless there is no noise, interference or loss of propagation, since it would be likely the signal would be unintelligible.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>SINPO</b> <b>code</b> {{in normal}} use {{consists}} of the 5 rating numbers listed without the letters, as in the examples below: ...|$|E
50|$|The term {{is arguably}} {{derived from the}} signal quality rating systems such as shortwave's <b>SINPO</b> <b>code</b> or amateur radio's RST code. Given that this slang spans not only generations but also a {{spectrum}} of communications technologies (spark-gap transmitters, shortwave, radio telephone, citizen's band (CB) radio, cellular among others) and organizations (hobbyist, commercial, military), there are many interpretations in popular misuse.|$|E
50|$|Some {{listeners}} may {{not know}} how to distinguish between the 'I' which indicates interference from adjacent stations, and the 'N' which describes natural atmospheric or man-made noise; also for some listeners, the rating for 'Propagation' may not be completely understood. As a result of this confusion, many stations suggest the SIO code -- a simpler code which makes the limitations noted above not relevant. Despite this, some books and periodicals maintain the <b>SINPO</b> <b>code</b> is the best for DX reporters.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{original}} <b>SINPO</b> <b>code</b> established technical specifications for each number (i.e., a number 3 in the P column meant a fixed number of fades per minute), these are rarely adhered to by reporters. The 'S' meter displays the relative {{strength of the}} received RF signal in decibels; however, {{this should not be}} used as the sole indication of signal strength, as no two S meters are calibrated exactly alike, and many lower-priced receivers omit the S meter altogether. References to a [...] "SINFO" [...] code may also be found in some literature. In this case, the 'F' stands for Fading, instead of 'P' for Propagation, but the two codes are interchangeable. It was presumed that the average listener would be more familiar with the meaning of [...] "fading" [...] than [...] "propagation". A simple way to insure the rating applied is useful is to rate the [...] "O" [...] column first based on the intelligibility of the station. If you can understand everything easily, the station will rate a 4 or higher. If you have to work hard, but can understand everything '3' is the appropriate rating. If you cannot understand everything although you put great effort into it, a '2' is appropriate, and if you cannot understand the programming at all '1' is the appropriate rating.|$|E
