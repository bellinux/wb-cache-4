40|$|In {{the present}} case study, shaping/desensitization procedures, along with {{behavioral}} contracts, were implemented through a consultation model {{in an attempt}} to treat a seven year-old elective mute female within the school setting. The author (consultant) provided information to the subject 2 ̆ 7 s teacher (consultee) in order to treat the subject 2 ̆ 7 s elective mutism. The procedure consisted of trials using a <b>sound-level</b> <b>meter</b> to successively approximate the desired behavior of speaking at school. The goal was for the subject to respond verbally to questions and requests invoked by her teachers and peers within the school setting and to improve her social interactions. The results indicated that, although the subject did not initiate verbalizations at school, she did begin to interact, both socially and verbally, with her peers outside of school. Several issues are examined {{in an attempt to}} explain possible reasons for the subject 2 ̆ 7 s failure to speak at school. Recommendations are also made for future studies...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} study the {{associations}} of noise with heart rate, blood pressure, and perceived psychological and physiological responses among post-cardiac surgery patients in ICUs. METHODS: Forty patients {{participated in this study}} after recovering from anesthesia. A <b>sound-level</b> <b>meter</b> was placed at bedsides to measure noise level for 42 hours, and patients' heart rate and blood pressure were recorded every 5 minutes. Patients were also interviewed for their perceived psychological/physiological responses. RESULTS: The average noise level was between 59. 0 and 60. 8 dB(A) at the study site. Annoyance and insomnia were the respective psychological and physiological responses reported most often among the patients. Although noise level, irrespective of measures, was not observed to be significantly associated with the self-assessed psychological and physiological responses, it was significantly associated with both heart rate and blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the noise in ICUs may adversely affect the heart rate and blood pressure of patients, which warrants the attention of hospital administrators and health care workers...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundExcessive {{noise in}} {{nurseries}} {{has been found}} to cause adverse effects in infants, especially preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The NICU design may influence the background sound level. We compared the sound level in two differently designed spaces in one NICU. We hypothesized that the sound level in an enclosed space would be quieter than in an open space. MethodsSound levels were measured continuously 24 hours a day in two separate spaces at the same time, one enclosed and one open. <b>Sound-level</b> <b>meters</b> were placed near beds in each room. Sound levels were expressed as decibels, A-weighted (dBA) and presented as hourly Leq, Lmax, L 10, and L 90. ResultsThe hourly Leq in the open space (50. 8 - 57. 2 dB) was greater than that of the enclosed space (45. 9 - 51. 7 dB), with a difference of 0. 4 - 10. 4 dB, and a mean difference of 4. 5 dB (p < 0. 0001). The hourly L 10, L 90, and Lmax in the open space also exceeded that in the enclosed space (p < 0. 0001). ConclusionThe sound level measured in the enclosed space was quieter than in the open space. The design of bed space should be taken into consideration when building a new NICU. Besides the design of NICU architecture, continuous monitoring of sound level in the NICU is important to maintain a quiet environment...|$|R
40|$|Sound {{travels through}} the air as waves of minute air {{pressure}} fluctuations caused by some type of vibration. In general, sound waves travel away from the sound source as an expanding spherical surface. The energy contained in a sound wave is consequently spread over an increasing area as it travels away from the source. This results in a decrease in loudness at greater distances from the sound source. The following terms are commonly used in acoustics. Decibel <b>Sound-level</b> <b>meters</b> measure the pressure fluctuations caused by sound waves. Because of {{the ability of the}} human ear to respond to a wide dynamic range of sound pressure fluctuations, loudness is measured in terms of decibels (dB) on a logarithmic scale. This results in a scale that measures pressure fluctuations in a convenient notation and corresponds to our auditory perception of increasing loudness. A-Weighted Decibels Most sounds consist of a broad range of sound frequencies. Because the human ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies, several frequency-weighting schemes have been used to develop composite decibel scales that approximate the way the human ear responds to sound levels. The “A-weighted ” decibel scale (dBA) is the most widely used for this purpose. Typical A-weighted sound levels for various types of sound sources are summarized in Figure G- 1. Equivalent Sound Level Time-varying sound levels are often described in terms of an equivalent constant decibel level. Equivalent sound levels (Leq) are used to develop single-value descriptions of average sound exposure over various periods of time. Such average sound exposur...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the experimental basis of acoustic signal evaluation in a frequency domain using experimental data acquired by a <b>sound-level</b> <b>meter</b> Mediator 2238 from scanning of the acoustic signal arisen during the rock disintegration process by means of rotary drilling. The paper also {{focuses on the}} model of mathematical processing of parallel-scanned acoustic signal. The research field is complex due to properties of the process and the subsequent proper physical application of measured values and the design of a proper mathematical model of the process. The research is based on a conception that a signal of mechanical vibrations, i. e. also an accessory acoustic signal, carries an information on a stage of disintegration process, which might be used for its identification, control and optimization of rock disintegration process. As the problem is very extensive, many patterns of several science areas have to be considered and coordinated, such as rock disintegration, acoustics, scanning and processing of monitored signals, not only during the experiments but also at their evaluation and finding new relations and models...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 45 - 47) A {{study was}} undertaken {{to measure and}} describe noise levels in which food service workers function. A General Radio Company precision <b>sound-level</b> <b>meter</b> {{was used to measure}} noise levels in ten volume feeding operations ranging in output from 1, 000 to 9, 000 meals per day. Sound pressure levels (SPL's) were taken on the A weighing scale of the <b>sound-level</b> <b>meter</b> at slow response for background noise and at fast response for impact noise, noting the rate per minute at which the impacts occurred. Sound pressure levels were taken at all work stations and in areas where communication, supervisory or clerical work took place at times of maximum operation, and in dining areas at or near capacity occupation. The results are compared to governmental codes for permissible noise exposure and to speech interference levels. At only one work station in one operation was the background noise SPL in excess of the damage risk level of 90 dBA. The station had a SPL of 99 dB, to which a worker can only be exposed {{for two and a half}} hours without being in violation of Walsh-Healey Act and the Noise Control Safety Orders for the State of California and without risking hearing loss. All pot and dish machine operations had background noise levels averaging 82 dBA and impact noise here was highest and most frequent in terms of occurrence per minute. A large battery of steam equipment also produced a high SPL of 81 dBA. Using 65 dB as a maximum background noise level for a successful and reliable conversation face-to-face and by telephone, open food production areas at maximum operation are in most instances too noisy for satisfactory communication. Using 65 dB as a maximum background noise level for successful and reliable conversation face-to-face and by telephone, open food production areas at maximum operation are in most instances too noisy for satisfactory communication. Enclosed areas create a good environment for communication with levels between 52 and 59 dBA. The fourteen partially enclosed areas measured had noise levels of 57 to 72 dBA. Impact noise higher than background noise occurred in all work stations with the rate of occurrence per minute increasing as the activity increased, Measurements indicated that most impact noises ranged from 4 to 22 dB higher than the background noise and occurred at a rate of from eight to forty-five per minute. Dining areas near capacity had noise levels from 65 to 75 dBA, with the principal noise source being conversation of the diners and movement of people...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE : To {{determine}} if a smartphone application {{could be used as}} a calibrated screening audiometer with real-time noise monitoring for school screening using automated test sequences. DESIGN : The investigation comprised three studies. Study 1 evaluated calibration accuracy across four Samsung S 5301 smartphones (Android v 4. 0. 4) using commercial Sennheiser HD 202 headphones. Study 2 involved referencing smartphone microphone sensitivity to narrowband noise intensity as measured in octave bands by a <b>sound-level</b> <b>meter</b> between 30 and 75 dB SPL (5 dB increments). Study 3 compared screening outcomes of smartphone based and conventional hearing screening. STUDY SAMPLE : Study 2 : 15 normal-hearing subjects (age range, 18 – 22 years; all female). Study 3 : 162 children (324 ears) aged 5 to 7 years. RESULTS : Smartphone calibration at 20, 30, and 40 dB was within 1 dB of recommended reference equivalent thresholds levels. Microphone calibration for noise monitoring had maximum variability across phones of 0. 9, 0. 6, and 2. 9 dB at 1, 2, and 4 kHz, respectively, from reference intensities (30 to 75 dB SPL). Screening outcomes demonstrated no signifi cant difference between smartphone and conventional audiometry with an overall referral rate of 4. 3 % and 3. 7 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS : The newly developed smartphone application can be accurately calibrated for audiometry with valid real-time noise monitoring, and clinical results are comparable to conventional screening.

40|$|Objective We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the use of an electrocardiogram (EKG) electrode over decannulation dressings covering the stoma to improve speech intelligibility and volume and reduce air escape by facilitating identification of the “sweet spot” of the dressing. No objective data exist for patient outcomes with use of the EKG electrode dressing. Methods This prospective study included head and neck oncology patients at a tertiary hospital who received a tracheostomy. A standard tracheostomy decannulation dressing was placed followed by an EKG electrode. A speech pathologist evaluated speech volume via <b>sound-level</b> <b>meter</b> and captured speech intelligibility for random sentence-level speech. A blinded reviewer scored speech samples for intelligibility. Patients completed a 4 -question satisfaction survey. Results Four patients completed the study. Based on the survey, the patients favored the button, with the lowest scores being 8. 5 out of 10. Speech understanding was 48. 5 % without the button and 83 % with the button. Normal speech volume was 73. 75 dB without the button and 77. 75 dB with the button. Loud speech volume was 80. 75 dB without the button and 87 dB with the button. Discussion This pilot study shows objective benefits of the EKG button as well as improved patient satisfaction. Inexpensive and low maintenance, the EKG electrode provides better occlusion of stoma dressing with easier localization. Implications for Practice Dissemination of our results will aim to improve quality and patient outcomes following decannulation...|$|E
