5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a <b>split-up</b> couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

40|$|In {{this note}} we set-up an {{explicit}} 5 D construction of AdS-fragmentation, whereby a single black ring <b>splits-up</b> into a multi-black ring configuration.

It is seen that the physical charges involved in black ring fragmentation are Page charges arising due to 5 D Chern-Simons terms. As an application of these methods, we reproduce the total angular momentum of concentric black rings, originally due to Gauntlett and Gutowski. Finally we provide a geometric interpretation of fragmented black rings using the idea of split-spectral flows, which seeks to study charge shifts of a given black ring due to fluxes generated in a multi-ring background. ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryKirromycin is {{a complex}} linear polyketide {{that acts as a}} protein {{biosynthesis}} inhibitor by binding to the bacterial elongation factor Tu. The kirromycin biosynthetic gene cluster was isolated from the producer, Streptomyces collinus Tü 365, and confirmed by targeted disruption of essential biosynthesis genes. Kirromycin is synthesized by a large hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS) /nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) encoded by the genes kirAI–kirAVI. This complex involves some very unusual features, including the absence of internal acyltransferase (AT) domains in KirAI-KirAV, multiple <b>split-ups</b> of PKS modules on separate genes, and swapping in the domain organization. Interestingly, one PKS enzyme, KirAVI, contains internal AT domains. Based on in silico analysis, a route to pyridone formation involving PKS and NRPS steps was postulated. This hypothesis was experimentally proven by feeding studies with [U- 13 C 315 N]β-alanine and NMR and MS analyses of the isolated pure kirromycin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{previous}} work [7], {{we proposed a}} general framework for defining agent-based models (ABMs) and introduced two algorithms for the automatic paralleliza-tion of agent-based models: a general version P-ABMG for all ABMs definable in the framework and a more specific variant P-ABMS for “spatial ABMs”, which can utilize the additional spatial information to obtain performance improvements. Both algorithms can automatically distribute ABMs over multiple processors and dynamically adjust the degree of parallelization based on available computational resources throughout the simulation runs. However, they are not sensitive to inef-ficiencies in the sequence in which agents in each parallel simulation instance are updated. In this chapter, we introduce a minimal framework for describing ABMs and pro-pose various asynchronous scheduling algorithms for agent-based simulations that address the update inefficencies of simulation schedulers. The proposed algorithms work in conjunction with P-ABMG and P-ABMS and allow for efficient simulation runs that can automatically and better utilize the asynchronous nature of parallel distributed agent-based simulations (including <b>split-ups</b> of specific simulation mod-els and dynamic load-balancing). We demonstrate the significant performance gains of the proposed algorithms using an actual agent-based model used for studying female choice and foraging in biological research...|$|R

In particular, author tests the factors of vertical integration suggested by transaction cost theory. Finally, the attempt is made to estimate the effect of structural change on firm performance, in particular, on productivity.

40|$|Gross job {{and worker}} flows in Russian {{industry}} are studied using panel {{data from a}} recent survey of 530 firms selected through national probability sampling. The data permit an examination of several important measurement issues – including the timing and definition of employment, the roles of <b>split-ups</b> and mergers, and the relative magnitudes of rehiring and new hiring and of quits and layoffs – and they contain a rich set of firm characteristics that may affect job and worker turnover. The results imply that job destruction and worker separation rates in industrial firms rose in the early 1990 s, as did job flows as a fraction of worker flows and layoffs as a fraction of separations. By contrast, job creation and worker hiring rates were flat until 1999, the former low and the latter surprisingly high. Heterogeneity in individual firm behavior increased throughout. New firms and old enterprises that have been reorganized display much larger flows compared with unreorganized enterprises. Unions appear to reduce worker flows, but the structure of neither product nor labor markets shows a significant impact. Private ownership has ambiguous effects: insider ownership, particularly by managers, is associated with higher worker flows and excess job reallocation, while outsider ownership, particularly by blockholders, is associated wit...|$|R

40|$|Dissertação (mestrado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro de Filosofia e Ciências Humanas, Programa de Pós-Graduação em História, Florianópolis, 2016. Durante a ditadura civil-militar muitos brasileiros/as deixaram o Brasil no intuito de preservar a vida, escapar da repressão ou perseguição, banidos, por autoexílio, para acompanhar familiares, entre outras circunstâncias que estiveram presentes. O objetivo desta dissertação é verificar de que maneira as relações de gênero e os laços (familiares, afetivos e os conjugais) estiveram presentes nas memórias do exílio político da ditadura civil-militar do Brasil (1964 - 1979). Desta forma, busco perceber a partir destas duas lentes as importantes relações hierárquicas constituídas ou rompidas no deslocamento exilar e na vida cotidiana do novo contexto. O recorte {{temporal}} estabelecido para a pesquisa foi de 1964 com o golpe de estado até 1979 com a Lei de Anistia. O processo de (auto) exclusão vivido de maneira heterogênea se tornou alvo de inúmeras memórias que emergiram durante ou após este período. Desta forma, são fontes para esta dissertação os dois livros do Projeto Memórias do Exílio, autobiografias publicadas, e entrevistas de história oral realizadas para esta pesquisa. Ao longo da pesquisa foi possível perceber a construção hierárquica na qual é pautada a categoria exílio, a influência das relações de gênero para o deslocamento exilar, e as rupturas que o exílio possibilitou com a estadia no exterior. Um ponto muito importante que catalisou novas leituras, mudanças de perspectivas, e transformações comportamentais foi o contato com o feminismo realizado no exterior durante o exílio, e que atravessa todas as análises desta dissertação. Abstract : During the civil-military dictatorship many Brazilians {{left their}} country {{in order to}} preserve life, to escape from repression or persecution, by different ways: been banned, autoexile, to accompany family members, and any other circumstances. The objective of this dissertation is to check how gender relations and the relationships (family, affective, and marital) were in the memories of political exile of the civil-military dictatorship in Brazil (1964 - 1979). Therefore, I seek to perceive from these two lenses the important hierarchical relationships established (or broken) in the exile displacement and everyday life on the new context. The timeline established for this research was from 1964, with the coup d'etat, until 1979, with the Amnesty Law. The process of (self) exclusion heterogeneously experienced became the target of many memories that emerged during or after this period. Thus, the sources for this thesis are two books of Exile Memories Project, autobiographies and oral history interviews, these last ones taken to this research. During the research, it was revealed the hierarchical construction in which is guided the exile category, the influence of gender relations to the exile displacement, and the <b>split-ups</b> enabled by the exile during the time abroad. An important point, which catalyzes new readings, changes of perspective, and behavioral changes, was also the abroad contact with feminism, what goes through all the analysis of this thesis...|$|R
