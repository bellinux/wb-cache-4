25|$|Stern's first {{contract}} with Sirius was worth $500 million; {{a budget of}} $100 {{million a year for}} production, staff, and programming costs. In 2005, he formed two channels, Howard 100 and Howard 101, which launched in September, and formed Howard 100 News, a team of news reporters hired to report daily stories surrounding the radio show and those associated with it. Stern ended his eleven-year association with E! and secured a deal with the iN DEMAND network to launch Howard Stern On Demand, an digital cable video-on-demand service, to broadcast uncensored tapings of the Sirius radio show. The service was relaunched as HowardTV in March 2006 and lasted until it was discontinued in December 2013. A new, state-of-the-art studio and office space was constructed for the show at Sirius' headquarters in New York City. On January 9, 2006, the day of his first broadcast on Sirius, Stern and Buchwald received a total of 34.3 million shares of Sirius stock worth $218 million for exceeding agreed <b>subscriber</b> <b>number</b> targets set when the contract was signed. A second subscriber bonus was met in January 2007, and Stern received 22 million shares of stock worth $82.9 million. In 2006, Time magazine included Stern in its Time 100 list, who also ranked seventh on Forbes Celebrity 100 list in June 2006. When Sirius merged with rival service XM Satellite Radio in 2008 to form SiriusXM, the company paid Stern $25 million as per a clause in his contract.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{international}} telephone network, {{the format of}} telephone numbers is standardized by ITU-T recommendation E.164. This code specifies that the entire number should be 15 digits or shorter, and begin with a country prefix. For most countries, {{this is followed by}} an area code or city code and the <b>subscriber</b> <b>number,</b> which might consist of the code for a particular telephone exchange. ITU-T recommendation E.123 describes how to represent an international telephone number in writing or print, starting with a plus sign ("+") and the country code. When calling an international number from a landline phone, the + must be replaced with {{the international}} call prefix chosen by the country the call is being made from. Many mobile phones allow the + to be entered directly, by pressing and holding the [...] "0" [...] for GSM phones, or sometimes [...] "*" [...] for CDMA phones.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{provisions}} {{allowed for}} the disclosure of electronic communications to law enforcement agencies.

The definition of a [...] "protected computer" [...] is defined in [...] and broadly encompasses those computers used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including ones located outside the United States. The law governing obligatory and voluntary disclosure of customer communications by cable companies was altered to allow agencies to demand such communications under U.S.C. Title 18 provisions relating to the disclosure of electronic communications (chapter 119), pen registers and trap and trace devices (chapter 206) and stored communications (121), though it excluded the disclosure of cable subscriber viewing habits. Subpoenas issued to Internet Service Providers were expanded to include not only [...] "the name, address, local and long distance telephone toll billing records, telephone number or other <b>subscriber</b> <b>number</b> or identity, and length of service of a subscriber" [...] but also session times and durations, types of services used, communication device address information (e.g. IP addresses), payment method and bank account and credit card numbers.
