40|$|We {{consider}} {{a world in}} which individuals have private endowments and trade in markets, while their utility is sensitive to the consumption of their neighbors. Our interest is in understanding how social structure of comparisons, taken together with the familiar fundamentals of the economy � endowments, technology and preferences � shapes equilibrium prices, allocations and welfare. We find that equilibrium prices and allocations depend on average individual centrality in the social network. As we add links to a social network, the centralities rise and this pushes up prices of the socially <b>sensitive</b> <b>good.</b> Newly linked agents demand more of the socially <b>sensitive</b> <b>good,</b> while the reverse happens with regard to the standard good. We derive a formula to compute the critical link, i. e., the new link which maximizes price increase. We then turn to a model with heterogenous endowments, and find that inequality in network centrality and in wealth inequality reinforce each other. Thus a transfer of resources from less to more central agents raises prices of the socially <b>sensitive</b> <b>good</b> and alters allocations and utilities of all agents. We show by example that poor individuals lose utility while rich individuals gain utility as society moves from segregation to integration. ...|$|R

Among many {{dimensional}} and dimensionless amplitude parameters, kurtosis (4 -th normalized mom-ent {{of probability}} density function) is {{generally regarded as}} a <b>sensitive</b> <b>good</b> parameter for machine diagnosis. However, higher order moment may be supposed {{to be much more}} sensitive. Bicoherence is an absolute deterioration factor whose range is 1 to 0. The theoretical value of n-th moment divided by n-th moment calculated by measured data would behave in the same way. We propose a simplified calcula-tion method for an absolute index of n-th moment and name this as simplified absolute index of n-th moment. Some favorable results are obtained...|$|R

StorageMart came to public attention in the early 2000s by using non-traditional buildings to house its storage facilities, including the use of a 10-story mid-rise building in Miami, Florida. This allowed the company to open facilities that were easily accessible for urban dwellers, and camouflage these facilities such that they appear to be just another office or residential complex.

50|$|Ships {{provided}} {{almost the}} only link for new supplies—overland travel was too difficult and took too long. One downside that soon developed in California was the long delay in {{communication between the}} east and west coast. It took over 40 days to get a message back to the East Coast of the United States and often over 200-300 days to get new supplies shipped in by sailing ships. Only high priced and lighter and smaller items could take the shorter and quicker paddle steamer route over the Isthmus of Panama, nearly everything else had to travel the approximate 17000 mi and over 200 day route all sailing ship route around Cape Horn or the Straits of Magellan. Higher priced, time <b>sensitive</b> <b>goods,</b> were often shipped in the faster clipper sailing ship which could make the trip from New York, Boston, etc. to San Francisco in about 120 days. Goods when they were shipped from the East coast (and Europe) were in shipload quantities when they arrived. This often suppressed the local market for that product and some goods would have to be auctioned off at low prices to pay for freight etc. with little or no profit. Very mixed cargo was typical of early shipments to minimize this problem. Food, liquors and building supplies nearly always be sold at a profit. Some business men thrived in this chaotic environment, many others lost their shirts.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} welfare effects of {{international}} migration {{in the presence}} of transboundary pollution. We use a simplified Copeland and Taylor (1999) model, where the (developed) home country's pollution abatement technology is superior to that of the (less developed) foreign country. If there is no trade, workers will migrate from the foreign country to the home country. The foreign country gains from migration, but whether the home country gains or not depends on the abatement-technology gap and the magnitude of the coefficient of transboundary pollution. World welfare will increase under migration. If there is free trade in goods, international migration occurs when the home country specializes in the production of the environmentally <b>sensitive</b> <b>good.</b> In this case, migration will result in increased production of the manufactured good and increase the level of world pollution.
