25|$|The {{result was}} that almost all the houses of the Rione south of the Passetto were demolished, and a new grand avenue emerged: the Via della Conciliazione (named after the Treaty of 1929 between Italy and the Holy <b>See).</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> major {{buildings}} (Santa Maria in Traspontina, Palazzo Torlonia, Palazzo dei Penitenzieri) were spared because they {{were more or less}} on axis with the new road.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} fake Galleons enchanted by Hermione for Dumbledore's army, we <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> other methods of closed channel {{communications}} {{used in the}} books and films. Subjects painted into wizarding portraits are frequently used to carry messages between locations where their portraits hang. Phineas Nigellus (former Hogwarts headmaster {{and member of the}} Black Family) is used to send messages between Dumbledore's office and his other portrait in Grimmauld Place. Hermione takes Phineas from Grimmauld Place during Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and uses Phineas to obtain information about events at Hogwarts. Dumbledore also uses two other former headmasters in a similar fashion when Arthur Weasley is attacked by Nagini in the Ministry of Magic. A portrait is also carries messages between the Minister of Magic and the Muggle Prime Minister in the opening of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Strange Bird, unlike its brief chart history, was overwhelmingly positive. The enthusiastic response even caught the band by surprise; Williams told Rip It Up [...] "I could <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{holes in the}} album and I'd say, 'how come {{no one else has}} picked this up?'" [...] Reviewers, however, focused on the positives; Guy Garvey of The Independent said [...] "My favourite of the year is Augie March's Strange Bird", while David Fricke wrote in Rolling Stone of [...] "luxuriant melees of chiming guitars, mountain-stream voices and keyboard grandeur". Donovan said the band found it hard to take the positive reviews too seriously; [...] "if we did our heads would explode or overinflate", he told Beat.|$|E

500|$|Astronomers and {{stargazers}} appreciate Cherry Springs State Park for {{the darkness}} and clarity of its skies, which make it [...] "perhaps the last best refuge of the natural night sky" [...] in {{the eastern half of}} the United States. The sky at Cherry Springs has been classified as a 2on the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale, meaning it has almost no light pollution. Such [...] "truly dark, starry skies are unavailable to two-thirds of the world's population, including 99percent of people in the continental U.S. and Western Europe". With optimum conditions, 10,000stars are visible with the naked eye at the park, clouds appear only as black holes in the starry sky, and the Milky Way is so bright that it casts a discernible shadow. In contrast, big city residents can <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> dozen stars at best, and even those in rural areas can typically only see 2,000–3,000stars. The Milky Way cannot be seen by most in the eastern US, even when there is no moonlight to obscure it.|$|E
500|$|Tornadoes {{are rare}} {{west of the}} I-25 corridor; however, one notable {{exception}} was an F3 tornado that struck 4.4 miles south of downtown on June 15, 1988. On the other hand, the suburbs east of Denver and the city's east-northeastern extension (Denver International Airport) can <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> tornadoes, often weak landspout tornadoes, [...] each spring and summer—especially during June with the enhancement of the Denver Convergence Vorticity Zone (DCVZ). The DCVZ, {{also known as the}} Denver Cyclone, is a variable vortex of storm-forming air flow usually found north and east of downtown, and which often includes the airport. Heavy weather from the DCVZ can disrupt airport operations. In a study looking at hail events in areas with a population of at least 50,000, Denver was found to be ranked 10th most prone to hail storms in the continental United States. In fact, Denver has received three of the top 10 costliest hailstorms in United States history which occurred on July 11, 1990; July 20, 2009; and May 8, 2017 respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The {{camp was}} {{dismantled}} in 1946. The hill {{has since been}} covered in dense vegetation that still does not manage to absorb the water that flows from the clay soil. One can <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> stones that were paths and the bases of cabins. [...] Groups of volunteers have begun to remove the overgrown weeds to display the origins in which some 64,000 people were forced to live during the various époques of the camp.|$|E

2500|$|The album's {{cover was}} {{unveiled}} on July 8, 2010 {{and met with}} positive reception. 'Idolator' said [...] "Ciara has been tempting us with her sexy new single 'Ride' ... but if you're looking for her goodies keep on looking because their [...] not on her Basic Instinct album cover (unless it's a seductive Playboy-esque fold out). The songstress, whose music video proved to be too hot for BET, kept things simple for the cover art." [...] Ciara then outlined plans for a mixtape to precede the album's release, in preparation she recorded remixes to Soulja Boy Tell 'Em's [...] "Pretty Boy Swag" [...] ("Pretty Girl Swag") and Waka Flocka Flame's [...] "Hard in Da Paint", {{as well as a}} cover of Young Jeezy's [...] "Lose My Mind". When asked by Gerrick D. Kennedy. from the Los Angeles Times, if the label [...] {{had anything to do with}} the delays in release or late promotion, Ciara replied [...] "I did <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> comments and I said, 'You know what? I one day look forward to being able to share with my fans (things that happen).' Right now, this is about living in a world of possibility and doing my best, [...]. Getting the record out there, I just want my fans to hear it. This album is really for my fans, and it's good to know the energy and the feedback has been great. It really is just the beginning". In February 2011, following rumors that Ciara had been dropped by Jive Records, Ciara released an official statement to her Facebook page. Amongst her complaints, were a lack of funding and support from the label with regards to promoting Basic Instinct. In addition to disagreeing with the label over single choices, Ciara personally funded the $100,000 video for her third single [...] "Gimmie Dat". [...] "I'm dedicated to my music, performance and to my fans! I've tried to be a team player with the label only to have compromised what I truly believed.. And was not given the right opportunity to promote and inform my fans of the release of this album." ...|$|E
