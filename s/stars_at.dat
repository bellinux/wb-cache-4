5|$|Having won two Michelin <b>stars</b> <b>at</b> the {{restaurant}} Harveys, chef Marco Pierre White felt restricted {{in the size}} of the premises as he sought to challenge for a third star. He was introduced to Rocco Forte, chairman of Rocco Forte Hotels, by actor Michael Caine. Forte had begun entering into arrangements with Michelin starred chefs, with Nico Ladenis holding <b>stars</b> <b>at</b> Chez Nico within Forte's Grosvenor House Hotel in Mayfair.|$|E

5|$|A better {{approximation}} {{is to take}} ε = L/M, {{the energy}} generation rate per unit mass, as ε is proportional to TI15, where TI is the core temperature. This is suitable for <b>stars</b> <b>at</b> least as massive as the Sun, exhibiting the CNO cycle, and gives the better fit R ∝ M0.78.|$|E
5|$|Capella was the {{brightest}} star in the night sky from 210,000 years ago to 160,000 years ago, at about −1.8 in apparent magnitude. At −1.1, Aldebaran was brightest before this period, and it and Capella were situated rather close {{to each other in the}} sky and served as boreal pole <b>stars</b> <b>at</b> the time.|$|E
5|$|Fifty-six {{games into}} his 2001–02 {{season with the}} Rangers, Sather dealt Malhotra to the Dallas <b>Stars</b> <b>at</b> the trade deadline, along with winger Barrett Heisten, in {{exchange}} for forwards Martin Rucinsky and Roman Lyashenko. Although he had established himself as an effective forechecker and defensive forward, Malhotra did not materialize into the offensive player the Rangers hoped he would be.|$|E

5|$|Canadian {{stars are}} {{inducted}} in an annual group ceremony; while the Hollywood Walk of Fame rarely inducts {{more than two}} major <b>stars</b> <b>at</b> a time. Celebrities can {{have more than one}} star on the Hollywood Walk, the same celebrity can receive as many as five stars under the various categories. This does not happen with Canada's Walk of Fame, although some may have an individual star but are also included {{as part of a larger}} group, such as John Candy, Martin Short, Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara who have their own star but also were in Second City Television.|$|E

5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce <b>stars</b> <b>at</b> a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|During {{a sabbatical}} year at Princeton University in 1960, Christy began an {{investigation}} of Cepheid variables and the smaller RR Lyrae variables, classes of luminous variable <b>stars.</b> <b>At</b> {{the time it was}} a mystery as to why they varied. He used the knowledge of the hydrodynamics of implosion gained at Los Alamos during the war to explain this phenomenon. This earned him the Royal Astronomical Society's Eddington Medal for contributions to theoretical astrophysics in 1967.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 Michelin Guide for the United Kingdom and Ireland, The Restaurant {{retained}} {{the two stars}} transferred from Harveys. However, White became the first British chef to win <b>stars</b> <b>at</b> two restaurants, with a Michelin star also being awarded to his restaurant Canteen under Stephen Terry in addition to The Restaurant. Later that year, The Restaurant was awarded a full three stars in Egon Ronay's Guide to British Eateries.|$|E

5|$|Inside No. 9 is an {{anthology}} series, with each episode featuring a new story, {{with a new}} setting and new characters. Episodes last around half an hour, with the self-contained story reaching a conclusion. The stories are linked only {{by the fact that}} each takes place in number 9, be that a mansion, a dressing room or a flat. Every episode <b>stars</b> <b>at</b> least one of Shearsmith or Pemberton, and normally both. Each episode is effectively a short play, and could easily be performed on stage. Most episodes take place in real-time, following half an hour {{in the lives of the}} characters.|$|E

The team moved from Evansville to Nashville for the 1985 season, {{upon which the}} Triplets' legacy was retired and the franchise adopted the Sounds' name and history, effectively elevating the organization from Double-A to Triple-A. The Double-A Southern League franchise was moved to Huntsville, Alabama, where the team began play as the Huntsville <b>Stars</b> <b>at</b> the hastily constructed Joe W. Davis Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Other guest {{stars in}} {{recurring}} roles include Linda Lavin as Nana Cohen, Daphne Ashbrook as Ryan's mother Dawn and Michael Nouri as Summer's father Neil.

5|$|Stars {{are created}} within galaxies from a reserve of cold gas that forms into giant {{molecular}} clouds. Some galaxies {{have been observed}} to form <b>stars</b> <b>at</b> an exceptional rate, which {{is known as a}} starburst. If they continue to do so, then they would consume their reserve of gas in a time span less than the lifespan of the galaxy. Hence starburst activity usually lasts for only about ten million years, a relatively brief period in the history of a galaxy. Starburst galaxies were more common during the early history of the Universe, and, at present, still contribute an estimated 15% to the total star production rate.|$|E
