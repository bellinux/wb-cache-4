40|$|Abstract Background Data on {{effect of}} regular liver {{function}} monitoring during anti-TB treatment {{is limited in}} China. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of <b>scheduled</b> liver function <b>monitoring</b> on identification of asymptomatic liver damage and anti-TB treatment outcomes during anti-TB treatment. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed based on a national-level cohort study. A total of 273 patients developing liver dysfunction {{were divided into two}} groups, 111 patients who were diagnosed through scheduled liver function test within two months after initiation of anti-TB treatment formed <b>scheduled</b> <b>monitoring</b> group, others who were diagnosed due to developing symptoms formed passive detection group (n[*]=[*] 162). The two groups were compared through clinical features, prognosis of liver dysfunction and impact on anti-TB treatment using propensity score weighting analysis. Results 33. 3 % of 273 patients did not have any clinical symptoms, including 8 with severe hepatotoxicity. 1. 8 % in <b>scheduled</b> <b>monitoring</b> group and 11. 1 % in passive detection group required hospitalization (P[*]=[*] 0. 004). Regarding the prognosis of liver dysfunction, most patients recovered, no death happened in <b>scheduled</b> <b>monitoring</b> group while 3 died in passive detection group. In terms of impact on anti-TB treatment, 35. 1 % in <b>scheduled</b> <b>monitoring</b> group and 56. 8 % in passive detection group changed their anti-TB treatment (P[*]=[*] 0. 001). Conclusions <b>Scheduled</b> <b>monitoring</b> is effective in identifying asymptomatic liver damage, reducing hospitalization rate and improving compliance of anti-TB treatment. </p...|$|R

40|$|Critical Chain Scheduling and Buffer Management (CC/BM) {{has shown}} {{to provide an}} {{effective}} approach for building robust project schedules and to offer a valuable control tool for coping with schedule variability. Yet, the current buffer monitoring mechanism faces a problem of neglecting the dynamic feature of the project execution and related activity information when taking corrective actions. The schedule risk analysis (SRA) method in a traditional PERT framework, on the other hand, provides important information about the relative activity criticality {{in relation to the}} project duration which can highlight management focus. It is implied,however, that control actions are independent from the current project schedule performance. This paper attempts to research these defects of both tracking methods and proposes a new project <b>schedule</b> <b>monitoring</b> framework by introducing the activity cruciality index as a trigger for effective expediting to be integrated into the buffer monitoring process. Furthermore, dynamic action threshold settings that depend on the project progress as well as the buffer penetration are presented and examined in order to exhibit a more accurate control system. Our computational experiment demonstrates the relative dominance of the integrated <b>schedule</b> <b>monitoring</b> methods compared to the predominant buffer management approach in generating better control actions with less effort and an increased tracking efficiency, especially when the increasing buffer trigger point is combined with decreasing sensitivity action threshold values. status: publishe...|$|R
