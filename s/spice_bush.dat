50|$|Bordered by 25 {{acres of}} rolling, wooded {{countryside}} {{protected by a}} Virginia historical easement, Bel Air rests at {{the crest of a}} rolling hummock, its broad front lawn on the southeast side of the home set with huge black walnut trees and oaks. The house is framed on the northwest by two massive willow oaks, beyond which opens a bowling green lined by towering magnolia trees, a saucer magnolia, and boxwood and <b>spice</b> <b>bushes.</b> Beyond the bowling green is the Ewell family cemetery ringed by azalea and big rhododendron bushes. On the southwest are sprawling formal colonial gardens with terraced rectangular beds of boxwood hedges, which were planted by the Florys on the site where the original gardens are presumed to have existed. Adjacent to the upper garden is an alley of large cedar trees leading to livestock and pole barns. On the northeast side of the home is a well house shaded by black walnut trees and a large American elm. The perimeter of the house itself is ornamented with boxwood bushes, with various species of English ivy garnishing the stone foundation.|$|R

We headed back to Kalkaringi and got some 'lawa' and 'yirrijkaji' from the side of the highway near the first bridge. Afterwards we got some firewood from the side of the Daguragu road in two places.

50|$|The Allocasuarina genus {{provides}} the predominant food {{source for the}} vulnerable glossy black-cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus lathami), with Allocasuarina rigida and Allocasuarina littoralis being the most commonly consumed. The Koala Habitat Atlas study performed on the former Noosa Shire in 1996/1997 and 2001/2002 confirmed that the Eucalyptus genus is a primary factor in habitat selection for koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus). The glossy <b>spice</b> <b>bush</b> (Triunia robusta) is currently endangered, {{and the majority of}} its population is restricted to Maroochy river area.|$|E
50|$|Eastern towhees nest in {{a variety}} of species {{including}} grape and blueberry (Vaccinium spp.). The majority of nests observed in South Carolina loblolly and longleaf pine forests and clearcuts were located in grape, tree sparkleberry (V. arboreum), and oak (Quercus spp.). On an oak-hickory site in West Virginia, 27% of 41 eastern towhee nests were found in grape, 17% in blackberry (Rubus spp.), 12% in greenbrier (Smilax spp.), and 12% in mountain-laurel (Kalmia latifolia). Nests also occurred in Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), <b>spice</b> <b>bush</b> (Lindera benzoin), and azalea (Rhododendron spp.). In a power line right-of-way in Pennsylvania, the 6 eastern towhee nests observed occurred in Allegheny blackberry, witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), white oak (Q. alba), eastern hayscented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula) and sweetfern (Comptonia peregrina) combined, and on ground level. According to literature reviews, eastern towhee nests located on the ground are embedded in litter in dry areas and typically occur at the base of grasses, forbs, low shrubs, or small trees.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{traditional}} Chinese and Korean medicine, an {{aqueous extract}} derived from wood and bark of the Japanese <b>spice</b> <b>bush</b> Lindera obtusiloba (L. obtusiloba) {{is applied to}} treat inflammations and chronic liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma. We previously demonstrated anti-fibrotic effects of L. obtusiloba extract in hepatic stellate cells. Thus, we here consequently examine anti-neoplastic effects of L. obtusiloba extract on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and the signaling pathways involved. Methods Four human HCC cell lines representing diverse stages of differentiation were treated with L. obtusiloba extract, standardized according to its known suppressive effects on proliferation and TGF-β-expression. Beside measurement of proliferation, invasion and apoptosis, effects on signal transduction and NF-κB-activity were determined. Results L. obtusiloba extract inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in all HCC cell lines and provoked a reduced basal and IGF- 1 -induced activation of the IGF- 1 R signaling cascade and a reduced transcriptional NF-κB-activity, particularly in the poorly differentiated SK-Hep 1 cells. Pointing to anti-angiogenic effects, L. obtusiloba extract attenuated the basal and IGF- 1 -induced expression of hypoxia inducible factor- 1 α, vascular endothelial growth factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, cyclooxygenase- 2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Conclusions The traditional application of the extract is confirmed by our experimental data. Due to its potential to inhibit critical receptor tyrosine kinases involved in HCC progression via the IGF- 1 signaling pathway and NF-κB, the standardized L. obtusiloba extract should be further analysed for its active compounds and explored as (complementary) treatment option for HCC. </p...|$|E
