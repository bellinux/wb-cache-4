5|$|NASA {{began to}} plan to resume <b>staffed</b> {{missions}} following the call by U.S. President George W. Bush on 14 January 2004 for a <b>staffed</b> {{mission to the}} Moon by 2019 {{and the construction of}} a lunar base by 2024. The Constellation program was funded and construction and testing begun on a <b>staffed</b> spacecraft and launch vehicle, and design studies for a lunar base. However, that program has been cancelled in favor of a <b>staffed</b> asteroid landing by 2025 and a <b>staffed</b> Mars orbit by 2035. India has also expressed its hope to send a <b>staffed</b> mission to the Moon by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Following President John F. Kennedy's 1961 {{commitment}} to a <b>staffed</b> moon landing {{before the end of}} the decade, the United States, under NASA leadership, launched a series of unstaffed probes to develop an understanding of the lunar surface in preparation for <b>staffed</b> missions: the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Ranger program produced the first close-up pictures; the Lunar Orbiter program produced maps of the entire Moon; the Surveyor program landed its first spacecraft four months after Luna 9. The <b>staffed</b> Apollo program was developed in parallel; after a series of unstaffed and <b>staffed</b> tests of the Apollo spacecraft in Earth orbit, and spurred on by a potential Soviet lunar flight, in 1968 Apollo 8 made the first <b>staffed</b> mission to lunar orbit. The subsequent landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969 is seen by many as the culmination of the Space Race.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lookout}} {{at the summit}} was abandoned, the Forest Service changed {{strategies}} from a few lookouts very high up to many lookouts on lower peaks. They placed many lookouts around Adams including one on the southwest slopes of Adams at Madcat Meadows, one on Goat Butte, one on Council Bluff above Council Lake, and many other places farther from the mountain. Eventually these lookouts became obsolete as airplanes became the cheaper method to spot fires. Most all of these lookouts have since been abandoned and most all have been removed or left to disintegrate. One, Burley Mountain, is <b>staffed</b> every summer and another, Red Mountain, was restored in 2010 and decisions regarding its future are pending. Two lookouts remain nearby on the Yakama Indian Reservation. One, Satus Peak, is <b>staffed</b> every season and the other, Signal Peak, is <b>staffed</b> during periods of high fire danger.|$|E

Considering <b>staffing</b> cost is important because <b>staffing</b> cost directly affects financial performance and sustainability.
