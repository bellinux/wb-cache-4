This closed-loop scheme requires each station to report its position after a timer has expired or it has moved 50 m or more, and to stop transmitting within 5 s when instructed to do so.

These advantages are the fruit of a preferred position conferred by the Government. Some present possibility for new entry by competing stations is not enough, in itself, to render unconstitutional the Government's effort to assure that a broadcaster's programming ranges widely enough to serve the public interest.|$|E

30|$|The {{deployment}} of modern day wireless devices follows the static spectrum usage, where spectrum {{is assigned to}} a licensed user for longer durations. This static spectrum assignment {{is considered to be}} extremely favorable {{in order to avoid the}} device-level collisions; however, it leads to radio spectrum shortage problem creating empty spectrum holes. According to [1], in both rural and urban areas, spectrum usage can go as low as 10 – 15 %, resulting in huge amount of spectrum to be wasted. As a result, the newly arriving unlicensed devices are forced to use unlicensed bands leading to inefficient and crowded <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilizations.</b>|$|R

30|$|In this work, we {{consider}} a cognitive radio system with one primary channel and one secondary user, {{and then we}} introduce a channel-usage pattern model and a fundamental access scheme in this system. Based on this model and fundamental access scheme, we study optimal opportunistic spectrum access problem and formulate it as an optimization problem that the secondary user maximizes <b>spectrum</b> holes <b>utilization</b> under the constraint of collision tolerable level. And then we propose a unified approach to solve this optimization problem. According to {{the solution of the}} optimization problem, we analyze and present optimal opportunistic spectrum access algorithms in several cases that the idle period follows uniform distribution, exponential distribution, and Pareto or generalized Pareto distribution. Theoretical analysis and simulation results both show that the unified approach to optimal opportunistic spectrum access can maximize <b>spectrum</b> holes <b>utilization</b> under the constraint that collision probability is bounded below collision tolerable level. At last, we analyze the impact of sensing errors on <b>spectrum</b> holes <b>utilization</b> and collision probability by simulation.|$|R
5000|$|To improve <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilization,</b> P25 Phase 2 was {{developed}} for trunking systems using a 2-slot TDMA scheme and is now required for all new trunking systems in the 700 MHz band. Phase 2 uses the AMBE+2 voice codec to reduce the needed bitrate so that one voice channel will only require 6,000 bits per second (including error correction and signalling). Phase 2 is not backwards compatible with Phase 1 (due to the TDMA vs FDMA operation), although TDMA radios and systems are capable of operating in Phase 1 FDMA when required. A subscriber radio cannot utilize TDMA transmissions without a time source, therefore direct radio to radio communications (talkaround) resorts to FDMA. And subscriber radios can also resort to narrow-band FM being the least common denominator between almost any two way radio. This could make analog narrow-band FM the de facto [...] "interoperability" [...] mode for some time.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{regulatory}} structures {{have been}} built for an analog model and are not optimized for cognitive radio. Regulatory bodies in the world (including the Federal Communications Commission in the United States and Ofcom in the United Kingdom) as well as different independent measurement campaigns found that most radio frequency spectrum was inefficiently utilized. Cellular network bands are overloaded {{in most parts of}} the world, but other frequency bands (such as military, amateur radio and paging frequencies) are insufficiently utilized. Independent studies performed in some countries confirmed that observation, and concluded that <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilization</b> depends on time and place. Moreover, fixed spectrum allocation prevents rarely used frequencies (those assigned to specific services) from being used, even when any unlicensed users would not cause noticeable interference to the assigned service. Regulatory bodies in the world have been considering whether to allow unlicensed users in licensed bands if they would not cause any interference to licensed users. These initiatives have focused cognitive-radio research on dynamic spectrum access.|$|E
5000|$|Millimeter waves {{propagate}} {{solely by}} line-of-sight paths, {{they are not}} reflected by the ionosphere nor do they travel along the Earth as ground waves as lower frequency radio waves do. [...] At typical power densities they are blocked by building walls and suffer significant attenuation passing through foliage. [...] Absorption by atmospheric gases is a significant factor throughout the band and increases with frequency. However it is maximum at a few specific absorption lines, mainly those of oxygen at 60 GHz and water vapor at 24 GHz and 184 GHz. [...] At frequencies in the [...] "windows" [...] between these absorption peaks, millimeter waves have much less atmospheric attenuation and greater range, so many applications use these frequencies. Millimeter wavelengths are the same order of size as raindrops, so precipitation causes additional attenuation due to scattering (rain fade) as well as absorption. [...] The high free space loss and atmospheric absorption limits useful propagation to a few kilometers. Thus, they are useful for densely packed communications networks such as personal area networks that improve <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilization</b> through frequency reuse.|$|E
