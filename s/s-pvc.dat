The assessment of water use by industrial manufacturing processes located in areas experiencing water stress is necessary to ensure a sustainable water resources management. The objective {{of this study is}} to demonstrate the use of life cycle assessment as a tool for assessing water use in an industrial manufacturing process. A case study of <b>S-PVC</b> resin manufacturing process located in Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate, Rayong province, Thailand, is presented. The studying results indicate that the amount of water used to produce 1 Kg of <b>S-PVC</b> resin is 14. 72 liters, of which 6. 22 liters are withdrawn from local water resources. Additionally, the direct and indirect water use along the production supply chain is accounted for in a streamlined life cycle assessment...|$|E
