They managed to convince Delhi University authorities to agree to set up the Chair in the name of littérateur-philosopher-artist of Medieval Assam in its Modern Indian Languages(MIL) Department, and also persuaded the Chief Minister of Assam to announce a Corpus Fund for the Chair of a million Rupees. However, neither Principal Deka not Dr Goswami could see their joint dream of setting up the chair fulfilled during their lifetime. After the untimely death of both the towering Assamese literary stalwarts, Arnab Jan Deka has been single-handedly working through his charity foundations Axom Ratna Principal Bhabananda Deka Foundation, Srimanta Sankardev Antarjatik Pratisthan (International Foundation) and Arnab Jan Deka Foundation to fulfil the dreams of both the departed litterateurs. Top Indian daily newspaper The Times of India repeatedly interviewed him regarding his persistent singular efforts at establishing Sankardev Chair in Delhi University.(2)He was nominated as Chief Editor of Katha Guru Charit English translation project by the Speaker of Assam Legislative Assembly in 1998. The project was envisioned to project the entire life and intellectual works of Assamese Medieval-age Saint-Philosopher-Poet-Littérateur-Artist Srimanta Sankardev in a comprehensive manner to the world academia;(3)He also conducted Research on medieval age saint-littérateur-philosopher of Assam, India, Srimanta Sankardev's pioneering works on propagating ideas of Democracy, Fraternity and Equality, and authorship and enactment of several full-length Dramas in Assamese language in the 15th Century world, which may eventually establish him {{as one of the first}} few propagators of these modern concepts and first few Dramatists-contemporaries of William Shakespeare. He successfully edited the English biographical book Sreemanta Sankaradeva originally authored by renowned scholar Principal Bhabananda Deka, which incorporates invaluable English translations of some of Sankardev's major literary works including Kirtan Ghoxa and Borgeet. Second Edition of this valuable book is published in 2015, and critically acclaimed worldwide;(4)He jointly undertook an Indo-British environmental project Save the Brahmaputra River in order to conduct extensive research and environmental audit on the serious environmental threats faced by this one of the world's mightiest rivers.(5)He collaborated with MIT, Boston, faculty-trainer Gwyndaf Jones in the first successfully executed Indo-American eco-friendly technology development project of 3 <b>Sprocket</b> <b>Chain</b> System for Tricycles in order to enhance the efficiency of carbon-neutral vehicles, in order to reduce global carbon footprint;(6)He discovered an unheralded silent innovator Uddhab Bharali from Lakhimpur town in Assam, India, who invented many cheap Machines for handy domestic and commercial use including, Paddy Thrashing Machine, Mini Tea Processing Plant, Pomegranate Deseeder Machine, Artificial Workable Limbs for Accident Victims, Grass Cutting Machines etc.; and brought him and his innovations to the limelight for the very first time by writing about him both in Assamese and English in prominent daily newspapers Dainik Asam and Assam Express in 1995;(7)He discovered and established the fact that pioneer Assamese filmmaker Jyotiprasad Agarwala is also the First Indian Filmmaker to have introduced and successfully used Dubbing Technology in his magnum opus first movie Joymoti (1935 film);(8)He conducted research on Life and Works of several Assamese legendary literary and cultural stalwarts including Dr Bhupen Hazarika, Principal Bhabananda Deka and Pradip Chaliha;(9)He has conducted extensive research on the trail of first pioneering formal research, documentation and publication of books on the Economic Condition of Kingdom of Kamrup, Pragjyotisha and Assam, which eventually became a state in the Republic of India in the mid-20th Century, and also edited a book Ancient Heritage of Assam compiling research papers of several top scholars;(10)He recovered, edited and published the historic first English book on Assamese language and literature meant for common readers of the world, which was originally authored by Principal Bhabananda Deka with his associates and officially released by the President of India Dr Zakir Hussain in New Delhi on 24 November 1968 on the occasion of the birth centenary of Assamese literary legend Sahityarathi Lakshminath Bezbaroa.|$|E

40|$|Over-exposure to noise {{remains a}} widespread, serious health hazard in the U. S. mining {{industry}} despite 25 years of regulation. Most other categories of illnesses and injuries associated with mining have improved, {{with the exception}} of hearing loss. In order to reduce cases of Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) in the mining industry, retrofit acoustic treatments and controls are being developed to subdue noise at the source. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) coal noise sample data collected from 2000 to 2005 has determined that continuous mining machines rank first among all mining equipment whose operators exceed 100 % noise dosage. The continuous mining machine conveyor, used to move coal from the cutting face {{to the rear of the}} machine, has been identified as a dominant noise source. A dual sprocket conveyor chain was tested as a potential solution. Sound power level measurements conducted at the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) accredited reverberation chamber showed a 3 dB reduction in the A-weighted sound power level when the dual <b>sprocket</b> <b>chain</b> was implemented. Underground results show an 8 -hour Time Weighted Average (TWA 8 hrs) reduction a 3 dB for continuous mining machine operators. Utilizing this newly developed noise control, along with previously proven controls, provides continuous mining machine operators an opportunity to be within the MSHA-Permissible Exposure Limit (MSHA-PEL) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — As we {{all know}} the fuel prices {{especially}} the petrol is rising steadily day by day. Again the pollution due to vehicles in metro cities & urban areas is increasing continuously. To overcome these problems, an effort is being made to search some other alternative sources of energy for the vehicles. Again, it is also not affordable to purchase vehicles (mopeds, scooters or motorcycles) for all the class of society. Keeping this in mind, a search for some way to cater these economically poor people as well as to provide a solution for the environmental pollution was in progress. The solar assisted bicycle developed is driven by DC motor fitted in front or rear axle housing & operated by solar energy. The solar panels mounted on the carriage will charge the battery & which in turn drive the hub motor. When the bicycle is idle, the solar panel will charge the battery. This arrangement will replace the petrol engine, the gear box & the fuel tank in case of a two wheeler or a chain <b>sprocket,</b> <b>chain</b> & gear shifting arrangement of a conventional bicycle being used by most common man.
