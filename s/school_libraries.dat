5|$|Goosebumps {{was listed}} 15th {{in the list}} of most {{frequently}} challenged books during 1990–1999 and 94th {{in the list of}} top banned/challenged books during 2000–2009 by the American Library Association (ALA). According to the ALA, a challenge is an attempt by a person or group to remove or restrict materials from a library or school curriculum. The series was challenged for being too frightening for young people and depicting occult or demonic themes. By 1997, the ALA was informed of 46 challenges, over 75% of which occurred in <b>school</b> <b>libraries.</b> The rest of the challenges were held in public libraries or the location of the challenges were unknown. The same year, a hearing by the Anoka-Hennepin School District to ban the books was broadcast by C-SPAN. In the hearing, most of the parents and children felt the books should not be banned, and the school district's book review committee decided to keep the books.|$|E
5|$|In the General Government, the {{remaining}} schools were subjugated to the German educational system, {{and the number}} and competence of their Polish staff was steadily scaled down. All universities and most secondary schools were closed, if not immediately after the invasion, then by mid-1940. By late 1940, no official Polish educational institutions more advanced than a vocational school remained in operation, and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the Nazi economy. Primary schooling was to last for seven years, but the classes {{in the final two}} years of the program were to be limited to meeting one day per week. There was no money for heating of the schools in winter. Classes and schools were to be merged, Polish teachers dismissed, and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the German minority or to create barracks for German troops. No new Polish teachers were to be trained. The educational curriculum was censored; subjects such as literature, history and geography were removed. Old textbooks were confiscated and <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> were closed. The new educational aims for Poles included convincing them that their national fate was hopeless, and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to Germans. This was accomplished through deliberate tactics such as police raids on schools, police inspections of student belongings, mass arrests of students and teachers, and the use of students as forced laborers, often by transporting them to Germany as seasonal workers.|$|E

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the film version, the novel has been {{assigned}} in many American high school (and sometimes middle school) English classes due to its young-adult protagonist.

40|$|The {{integrated}} <b>school</b> <b>library</b> program model {{advocated by}} <b>school</b> <b>library</b> professionals and described in government policy and library association position papers is an innovation {{that has been}} difficult to implement in North American schools. The model proposes that the primary role of the <b>school</b> <b>library</b> professional is teaching in partnership with classroom teachers. The librarian collaborates with classroom teachers and others to plan, teach, and assess critical information literacy skills and strategies integrated with curriculum content. Because elements of the integrated <b>school</b> <b>library</b> program challenge the traditional culture of the <b>school,</b> the <b>school</b> <b>library</b> professional often needs to work as a change agent. Changing the organizational culture of the school constitutes the key role and goal for the <b>school</b> <b>library</b> professional and requires a deep knowledge of the particular culture of the school and the complexities of the change process. Although the school as an organization has been buffeted by changes in the past half-century, some features of schools remain highly resistant to change. In concert with developing an integrated <b>school</b> <b>library</b> program, the <b>school</b> <b>library</b> professional can also be involved in implementing other specific instructional innovations or responding to broader school reform initiatives. The key concepts of organizational culture and change have important implications for <b>school</b> <b>library</b> professionals, educators, and researchers. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
