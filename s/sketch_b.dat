50|$|Looking at the {{geometry}} involved in step 1 results in sketch a: two right angled triangles, shown {{here with the}} identical small angles in yellow. Next in <b>sketch</b> <b>b</b> {{we see that the}} two triangles have identical angles - each has a right angle, the same small angle shown in yellow, and the same larger angle shown in orange. Therefore in sketch c we see that using the principle of similar triangles, given that each triangle has identical angles, the sides will be in proportion: x the distance to the object in proportion to x', the height set on the vertical scale of the hypsometer, and h the height of the object above the observers eye-line in proportion to h', the reading from the horizontal scale of the hypsometer.|$|E

40|$|A {{sketch of}} a matrix A is another matrix B which is {{significantly}} smaller than A but still approximates it well. Finding such sketches efficiently is an important building block in modern algorithms for approximating, for example, the PCA of massive matrices. This task is made more challenging in the streaming model, where each row of the input matrix can only be processed once and storage is severely limited. In this paper we adapt a well known streaming algorithm for approximating item frequencies to the matrix sketching setting. The algorithm receives n rows of a large matrix A ∈ R n×m {{one after the other}} in a streaming fashion. It maintains a <b>sketch</b> <b>B</b> ∈ R ℓ×m containing only ℓ ≪ n row...|$|E
40|$|Figure 1 : Results {{generated}} with PortraitSketch. Starting from image (a), {{a novice}} user created <b>sketch</b> (<b>b)</b> using our system without automated assistance. The same user created sketch (e) with automated assistance. For direct comparison, we post-adjusted (b) to generate (c). The assisted results (c and e) exhibit cleaner, more accurate outlines and more evenly distributed shading, {{compared to the}} unassisted drawing (b). All nine of our independent judges voted that (c) is a better drawing than (b). Image credits: (a) and (d) : Levy Carneiro Jr and chris zerbes, under a Creative Commons license. We present PortraitSketch, an interactive drawing system that helps novices create pleasing, recognizable face sketches without requiring prior artistic training. As the user traces over a source portrait photograph, PortraitSketch automati-cally adjusts the geometry and stroke parameters (thickness, opacity, etc.) to improve the aesthetic quality of the sketch. We present algorithms for adjusting both outlines and shad-ing strokes based on important features of the underlying source image. In contrast to automatic stylization systems, PortraitSketch is designed to encourage a sense of owner-ship and accomplishment in the user. To this end, all ad-justments are performed in real-time, and the user ends up directly drawing all strokes on the canvas. The findings from our user study suggest that users prefer drawing with some automatic assistance, thereby producing better drawings, and that assistance does not decrease the perceived level of in-volvement in the creative process...|$|E
