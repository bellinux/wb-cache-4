5|$|Larger {{species of}} procellariid face similar {{problems}} to the albatrosses with long-line fisheries. These species readily take offal from fishing boats and will also steal bait {{from the long}} lines as they are being set, risking becoming snared on the hooks and drowning. In {{the case of the}} spectacled petrel this has led to the species undergoing a large decline and its listing as critically endangered. Diving species, most especially the shearwaters, are also vulnerable to gillnet fisheries. Studies of gill-net fisheries show that shearwaters (sooty and short-tailed) compose 60% of the seabirds killed by gill-nets in Japanese waters and 40% in Monterey Bay, California in the 1980s, with the total number of shearwaters killed in Japan being between 65,000 and 125,000 per annum over the same <b>study</b> <b>period</b> (1978–1981).|$|E
5|$|Living River Siam (Thai: โครงการแม่น้ำเพื่อชีวิต; {{formerly}} South East Asia Rivers Network, or SEARIN) is a Thai {{non-governmental organization}} (NGO) which analyzes {{the impact of}} Thailand's various dam projects and coordinates the research of indigenous peoples to give Thai villagers the power to document the influence of local rivers and dams. Founded in 1999, it gained prominence during the Pak Mun Dam <b>study</b> <b>period</b> in 2001, when it developed a method for instructing villagers on how to document {{the effects of the}} dammed river on their lives. When the Thai government proposed other dam sites, Living River Siam took its research methods to the villages surrounding those sites as well. Today, the organization works with other NGOs in Southeast Asia to counter government-sponsored research that encourages dam construction.|$|E
5|$|A Japanese {{field study}} found that S.spraguei was the {{dominant}} fungus in a 21-year-old stand of Korean Pine, {{both in terms of}} ectomycorrhizae (measured as percentage of biomass present in soil samples) and by fruit body production (comprising over 90% of dry weight of total fruit bodies collected of all species). The production of S.spraguei fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter, without much variance during the four-year <b>study</b> <b>period.</b> The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November, tended to grow in clumps, and the spatial distribution of clumps was random—the location of the clumps was not correlatable with appearances in previous years. The density of mushrooms along a forest road was higher than average, suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat. The results also suggested that S.spraguei prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low litter accumulation, a finding corroborated in a later publication. This study also determined that the fungus propagates mainly by vegetative growth (extension of underground mycelia), rather than by colonization of spores.|$|E

5|$|German {{was first}} {{introduced}} into the curriculum in 1931, the same time at which the school began to offer voluntary after-school art classes. F. H. Taylor attempted to achieve equilibrium in the curriculum between arts and science subjects; he made woodwork and art continuous for an entire term and introduced a geography course for the Higher School Certificate. In 1948 rural biology {{was added to the}} curriculum for the first time, for which the headmaster provided a plot of land {{to be used as a}} vegetable plot. At the end of that year, an after-school <b>study</b> <b>period</b> was introduced; following the seven normal periods (five in the morning, two in the afternoon), students were to either begin their homework, or attend a school society. However, the 1950s saw a definite swing towards maths and science, and a subsequent increase in staffing in those departments. In 1957, zoology and botany was taught at A-level for the first time, and physics and chemistry replaced rural biology at O-level (now replaced by the GCSE).|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} number of fatalities involving one aircraft occurred in 1985 when 520 {{people died in the}} crash of Japan Airlines Flight 123. The most fatalities in an aircraft collision occurred during 1977 in the Tenerife airport disaster when 583 people were killed. The {{greatest number}} of fatalities from a midair collision occurred at the Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision, to the west of New Delhi, India on 12 November 1996 when a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747-100B en route from Delhi to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, collided with Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76 en route from Chimkent, Kazakhstan to Delhi, killing all 349 people aboard both the airplanes. The 11 September 2001 (9/11) coordinated attack of the World Trade Center claimed not only 157 passengers and crew, but an estimated additional 2,500 victims. In 2012, Boeing released a study of worldwide commercial jet airplane accidents between 1959 and 2011 reporting 1,798 accidents, 603 categorized as fatal, which accounted for 29,025 on-board fatalities and an additional 1,173 ground or non-commercial aircraft collision deaths.

25|$|However, boreal forests, {{particularly}} those in North America, showed a different response to warming.

25|$|In New South Wales, Australia, a {{study of}} equestrians seen at one {{hospital}} over a 6-year period found that 81% were wearing a helmet {{at the time of}} injury, and that helmet use both increased over time and was correlated with a lower rate of admission. In {{the second half of the}} <b>study</b> <b>period,</b> of the equestrians seen at a hospital, only 14% were admitted.

25|$|Additional {{proposed}} {{causes of}} the decreased rate of warming over the past 15 years include the emission of pine-smelling vapors from pine forests, which {{have been shown to}} turn into aerosols, and the ban on chlorofluorocarbons {{as a result of the}} Montreal Protocol, since they were potent greenhouse gases in addition to their ozone-depleting properties. Spurious differences in observed warming rates may also arise from the mathematics of trend analysis itself, particularly when the <b>study</b> <b>period</b> is brief and regression assumptions are violated.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{high rates}} of very early {{miscarriage}} (25% of pregnancies are lost within the first six weeks since the woman's last menstrual period, or LMP), the methods used to detect pregnancy may lead to bias in conception rates. Less-sensitive methods will detect lower conception rates, because they miss the conceptions that resulted in early pregnancy loss. A Chinese study of couples practicing random intercourse to achieve pregnancy used very sensitive pregnancy tests to detect pregnancy. It found a 40% conception rate per cycle over the 12-month <b>study</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
