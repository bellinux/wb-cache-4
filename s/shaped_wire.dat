Wire bound books are made of individual sheets, each punched with a line of round or square holes on the binding edge. This type of binding uses either a 3:1 pitch hole pattern with three holes per inch or a 2:1 pitch hole pattern with two holes per inch. The three to one hole pattern is used for smaller books that are up to 9/16" [...] in diameter while the 2:1 pattern is normally used for thicker books as the holes are slightly bigger to accommodate slightly thicker, stronger wire. Once punched, the back cover is then placed on to the front cover ready for the wire binding elements (double loop wire) to be inserted. The wire is then placed through the holes. The next step involves the binder holding the book by its pages and inserting the wire into a [...] "closer" [...] which is basically a vise that crimps the wire closed and into its round shape.

This paper presents a comparison of exergetic performance of solar air heaters having different types of geometry of roughness elements (continuous ribs) on the absorber plate. The exergy efficiency has been computed by using the correlations for heat transfer and friction factor developed by various investigators within the investigated range of operating and system parameters. The exergy efficiency based criterion shows the better results at lower value of Re. There is not a single roughness geometry which gives best exergetic performance for whole range of Reynolds number.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This work covers {{an investigation of the}} use of customised laser beam profiles to improve the characteristics of wire-based laser deposition, by using the modified beam to control the thermal cycle of the deposition process. Inherent disadvantages of wire fed deposition vs. powder have been previously identified; namely that it is highly sensitive to changes in processing parameters, a tendency to low surface quality and a high incidence of porosity and cracking. Two potential avenues are identified and explored for the purpose of improving these disadvantages: Laser beam shaping and wire cross-sectional modification. The investigation is presented in both theoretical modelling and physical experiments. Surface reflectivity calculations are predicted that relate the incidence angle profile across the wire width with it absorption profile. Further heat transfer simulations were used to compare the heat conduction within the wire for the various wire cross-sections and experimental beam profiles. From this, melting simulations are presented with a variety of wire shapes and beam profiles. A series of experimental studies are presented comparing the use of different beam profiles on a single wire geometry, and then a single type of beam profile on different wire geometries. These are analysed principally with optical microscopy, with selected samples also studied via EBSD analysis. These corroborated the simulation results, where the use of altered beam profiles was found to give improved results in regard to the ability to form a melt pool, reduced power requirements and improved dilution characteristics. Combining a shaped beam with <b>shaped</b> <b>wire</b> gave further improvements. Subsequent to this, experimental clad tracks are presented that show the ability to create multiple layers in different directions, as well as the ability to use <b>shaped</b> <b>wire</b> with a wire feeder. This work shows that through the ability to modify the laser beam and wire cross-sectional profiles together with each other, the deposition properties can be improved; with a reduction in required power, an improvement in clad track quality and a reduction in process sensitivity...|$|E

MMCs with different size of reinforcements (0. 7, 3 and 13. µm) as well as corresponding matrix material were machined under similar machining conditions to understand the effect of reinforcement size {{on the degradation of}} wire. In addition, pulse-on-time and wire tension were varied to understand the effect of machining parameters and interaction between machining parameters and size of the reinforcements. It was found that initial circular <b>shaped</b> <b>wire</b> deformed during the machining process as curved front and rear edges and two straight side edges irrespective of cutting conditions and workpiece materials. The curved edge at the front and straight side edges take part in material removal and experience sever degradations. The final cross-sectional area of the wire after the machining process is decided by balancing two mechanisms: (i) downward flow of highly malleable soft wire material due to high temperature which increases the diameter of wire electrode and (ii) vaporisation of the wire material at higher temperature which reduces the diameter of wire electrode. These complex processes are affected by machining conditions as well as workpiece materials...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates if the Mixed Potential Integral Equation (MPIE) {{with the}} Method of Moments {{technique}} {{can be used}} to calculate the surface currents on a thin wire entirely using B-Splines when treated as a scatterer. This technique eliminates the use of conventional numerical Gauss-Quadrature integration. The singularity of the potentials in the MPIE are of lower order than those of the EFIE (r compared to r) making the numerical computations of the integrals more accurate. By using second-degree B-Spline basis functions, fewer wire segments are needed therefore reducing the size of the impedance matrix and increasing the overall speed of the numerical calculations. The difficulty with this approach is developing an alternative method for the integration of the thin-wire approximation of the Green 2 ̆ 7 s function when it becomes singular. Integrating over the complete basis function also gave this approach a significant increase in computational speed. As an example, excellent results are obtained for the surface currents of a straight 2 λ thin wire dipole when compared with those results obtained in [1]. This technique can also be modified for an arbitrary <b>shaped</b> <b>wire</b> positioned anywhere in 3 D space...|$|E

Patients {{were divided into two}} groups. 1 – 58 (72. 5 %) patients with stable fractures, 2 – 22 (27. 5 %)  patients with unstable fractures.

In the second group: satisfactory performance were observed in 16 (88. 8 %) of 18  patients. The results of hip replacement in elderly patients with stable fractures pertrochanteric allow to speak about the effectiveness of this type of surgery. Endoprosthesis of transtrochanteric unstable fractures requires further study because of the extremely high frequency of postoperative complications (up 88. 8 %).

40|$|In laser cladding, the {{potential}} benefits of wire feeding are considerable. Typical problems with the use of powder, such as gas entrapment, sub- 100 % material density and low deposition rate are all avoided with the use of wire. However, the use of a powder-based source material is the industry standard, with wire-based deposition generally regarded as an academic curiosity. This is because, although wire-based methods {{have been shown to be}} capable of superior quality results, the wire-based process is more difficult to control. In this work, {{the potential}} for wire shaping techniques, combined with existing holographic optical element knowledge, is investigated in order to further improve the processing characteristics. Experiments with pre-placed wire showed the ability of <b>shaped</b> <b>wire</b> to provide uniformity of wire melting compared with standard round wire, giving reduced power density requirements and superior control of clad track dilution. When feeding with flat wire, the resulting clad tracks showed a greater level of quality consistency and became less sensitive to alterations in processing conditions.

40|$|The top contact {{electrode}} layers of nine organic photovoltaic cells were prepared with two varying factors: three Silver nanowire (AgNW) densities deposited on a conductive polymer doped with three concentrations. Silver’s low sheet resistance of 20 -Ω/sq is hypothesized {{to lower the}} sheet resistance of the anode layer and thus enhance the overall efficiency of the cell. Four-point probe measurements indicated that increasing AgNW density in the top {{contact electrode}} layer of an organic photovoltaic cell significantly reduces sheet resistance from 52. 2 k-Ω/sq to 18. 0 Ω/sq. Although an increase in doping concentration of the conductive polymer reduced sheet resistance in low AgNW density samples from 52. 2 k-Ω/sq to 5. 10 k-Ω/sq, only a minor decrease from 34. 7 -Ω/sq to 29. 2 -Ω/sq {{was found in the}} higher AgNW density samples. To explain these patterns, we propose a transition in charge carrier conduction mechanism from one of resistors in series (AgNW and polymer matrix), controlled by the resistance of the conductive polymer, to that of a parallel circuit, with resistance controlled by the resistance of silver. Proposed models are supported by the number of disjoints between AgNWs found in Scanning Electron Microscope characterizations at 20, 000 X magnification. The number of disjointed AgNWs within 2. 8 µm x 3. 2 -µm sections on the electrode surface decreased from an average of two to zero with increasing AgNW density.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between normal-mode helical antennas and human head models is analyzed, using both a novel accurate semi-analytical method and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. The semi-analytical method {{is based on}} the combination of Green's functions theory with the method of moments (Green/MoM) and is able to model arbitrarily <b>shaped</b> <b>wire</b> antennas radiating in the close proximity of layered iossy dielectric spheres representing simplified models of the human head. The purpose of the development of the Green/MoM technique is to provide a reliable tool for preliminary (worst case) estimation of human head exposure to the field generated by different antenna configurations with emphasis on the helical antenna, representing the most diffused antenna type used in modern cellular handsets. Furthermore, the accurate semi-analytical character of the Green/MoM technique permits the accuracy assessment of purely numerical techniques, such as the FDTD, which is currently the most widely used computational method in mobile communication dosimetric problems, since it allows modeling of anatomically based head models. After appropriate benchmarking, FDTD simulations are used to study the {{interaction between}} a heterogeneous anatomically correct model of the human head exposed to a normal-mode helix monopole operating at 1710 MHz mounted {{on the top of a}} metal box representing a realistic mobile communication terminal. The study of both canonical and realistic exposure problems includes computations of specific absorption rates (SARs) inside the human head, total power absorbed by the head and assessment of antenna performance.
