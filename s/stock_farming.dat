25|$|Mankind {{has been}} fascinated by the golden eagle {{as early as the}} {{beginning}} of recorded history. Most early-recorded cultures regarded the golden eagle with reverence. It was only after the Industrial Revolution, when sport-hunting became widespread and commercial <b>stock</b> <b>farming</b> became internationally common, that humans started to widely regard golden eagles as a threat to their livelihoods. This period also brought about the firearm and industrialized poisons, which made it easy for humans to kill the evasive and powerful birds. The following are various reportages of the significance of eagles, many likely pertaining to the golden eagles, in early cultures and older religions as well as national and military insignias.|$|E
60|$|Mary Erskine had a {{great deal}} of time for enquiry and {{reflection}} in respect to the proper mode of investing her money, for the man who purchased the farm and the stock was not to pay the money immediately. The price agreed upon for the farm, including of course the new house, was five hundred dollars. The <b>stock,</b> <b>farming</b> utensils, &c, which he took with it, came to three hundred and sixty dollars. The purchaser was to pay, of this money, four hundred dollars in three months, and the balance in six months. Mary Erskine, therefore, had to make provision for investing the four hundred dollars first.|$|E

40|$|Infestation {{patterns}} of the sea louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis from 44 salmon farms in the Hardangerfjord on the south-west coast of Norway over the period 2004 to 2007 were assimilated to create 20 -month production cycle profiles for spring and autumn stocked generations. The timing and frequency of in-feed and bath treatments to control sea lice associated with these profiles was considered. Spring and autumn <b>stocked</b> <b>farms</b> were observed to have different {{patterns of}} sea lice counts on salmon during {{the first and second}} years of production. Spring stocked sites experienced increasing infestation {{toward the end of the}} first year and on average counts remained elevated thereafter, whereas autumn stocked sites averaged lower sea lice counts throughout most of the production cycle until the latter part of the second year when these escalated rapidly. In-feed treatments were the predominant form of sea lice control in the first half of the production cycle on spring <b>stocked</b> <b>farms,</b> whereas bath treatments were used exclusively in the second half of the production cycle; a very similar pattern of therapeutant use was observed on autumn <b>stocked</b> <b>farms.</b> Results using the SLiDESim (Sea Lice Difference Equation Simulation) infection model and a range of biological and production parameters showed that modelling resulted in a better fit to the mobile lice profiles for autumn <b>stocked</b> <b>farms</b> compared to spring <b>stocked</b> <b>farms.</b> Some features of the mobile lice profiles were not captured by the infection model such as the oscillation of the population between months 11 and 18 of the production cycle on spring <b>stocked</b> <b>farms,</b> and a large peak observed in month 19 on autumn <b>stocked</b> <b>farms.</b> Before modelling can be used to evaluate optimal treatment strategies or other management interventions there remains a need to more clearly understand the underlying biological processes associated with the dynamics of sea lice infestations in the Hardangerfjord...|$|R
