40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{investigation}} of the properties of covalently bonded magadiite/polyimide nanocomposites synthesized with magadiite and polyimide（PI ）. Synthesized magadiite was organically modified by n-hexadecyl trimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB) and then grafted by γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS) γ-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPS) or γ-methacryloxy-propyltrimethoxysilane (MPS).

40|$|A new, {{simple and}} “green” method was {{developed}} for the surface modification of 20 nm diameter Stöber silica particles with 3 -aminopropyl(diethoxy) methylsilane in ethanol. The bulk polycondensation of the reagent was inhibited and {{the stability of the}} sol preserved by adding a small amount of glacial acetic acid after appropriate reaction time. Centrifugation, ultrafiltration and dialysis were compared in order to choose a convenient purification technique that allows the separation of unreacted silylating agent from the nanoparticles without destabilizing the sol. The exchange of the solvent to acidic water during the purification yielded a stable colloid, as well.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and solid-state 29 Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements are performed to examine the cross-linking of the silanes. Solid-state 13 C NMR spectroscopy provides information about the conformation and mobility of surface-immobilized alkyl chains. Variable temperature FTIR investigations are carried out to study {{the influence of the}} organosilane precursors and metal oxides on the conformational order of the alkyl modified systems. It is found that grafting by means of n-octadecyltrichlorosilane yields higher grafting densities than surface modification with n-octadecyltrihydridosilane. Combined pyridine adsorption and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) measurements are performed on the titania and hafnia substrates to evaluate potential surface heterogeneities, i. e. Lewis and Brønsted sites. Differences in the alkyl chain conformational order within the series of C 18 modified metal oxides are explained by the presence of island structures. The reduced C 18 conformational order for the samples grafted with n-octadecyltrihydridosilane is traced back to the lower grafting density which in turn points to a lower reactivity of this <b>silylating</b> <b>reagent.</b> The most striking result is the higher conformational order of the C 18 chains grafted in the present surface modified metal oxides when compared with silica-based systems.

For the future Mars exploratory mission Exomars 2018 aimed at organic molecules detection, a dedicated laboratory pilot, called Device for Pretreatment of Sample (DPS), reproducing representative space operating conditions has been developed.

40|$|The {{surface of}} a Ti/SiO 2 {{catalyst}} was silylated using hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and tetramethyldisilazane (TMDS) as <b>silylating</b> <b>reagents</b> in vapor phase. The silylation of silanol (Si–OH) on the catalysts was confirmed by diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, DRIFT spectroscopy and solid-state 29 Si MAS NMR techniques. Silylation with TMDS improves the catalytic performance of Ti/SiO 2 catalyst more significantly than with HMDS and this is mainly due to the steric bulk effects of trimethylsilyl groups from HMDS as compared to dimethylsilyl groups from TMDS. The silylation degree with TMDS {{was found to be}} higher than with HMDS and no changes in the silylation degree with TMDS was observed for silylation times longer than 2 h. Despite the silylation route employed, the silylated surface is hydrophobic which enhances not only in hydrogen peroxide efficiency but also and in selectivity to epoxide in the epoxidation of alkenes with H 2 O 2. These effects are more evident when the hydrogen peroxide concentration is higher and particularly for the catalyst modified with TMDS. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{results in}} the use of disilanes as <b>silylating</b> <b>reagents</b> for near-surface imaging with deep-UV (248 nm) and EUV (13. 5 nm) {{lithography}} are reported. A relatively thin imaging layer of a photo-cross-linking resist is spun over a thicker layer of hard-baked resist that functions as a planarizing layer and antireflective coating. Photoinduced acid generation and subsequent heating crosslinks and renders exposed areas impermeable to an aminodisilane that reacts with the unexposed regions. Subsequent silylation and reactive ion etching afford a positive-tone image. The use of disilanes introduces a higher concentration of silicon into the polymer than is possible with silicon reagents that incorporate only one silicon atom per reactive site. The higher silicon content in the silylated polymer increases etching selectivity between exposed and unexposed regions and thereby increases the contrast. Additional improvements that help to minimize flow during silylation are also discussed, including the addition of bifunctional disilanes.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes synthetic studies {{culminating in}} the total synthesis of the macrocyclic immunomodulaor (-) -rapamycin (1). Retrosynthetically, the molecule was divided into the fully functionalized intermediates 144 and 145. From these subtargets, rapamycin was completed in four steps: (1) union of the fragments via acylation at C(34); (2) intramolecular Stille coupling to form the triene and close the rapamycin macrocycle; (3) selective deprotection of the C(10) hemiketal hydroxyl; and (4) removal of the two remaining silyl protective groups. ^ Disconnection of the major subtargets generated the five building blocks (A-E) each {{of which could be}} prepared on multi-gram scale (Chapters 2 and 3). Independent couplings of the five intermediates were performed with the ultimate goal of developing the most efficient methods for their union. In the course of these investigations, extensive studies of the coupling of B and C subtargets and the formation of the rapamycin C(27) center were performed. These studies {{led to the development of}} efficient protocols for the generation of dithiane anions and their additions to iodohydrins, epoxides and aldehydes as well as the conclusion that the trisubstituted olefin α to a C(27) aldehyde was the stereochemical controlling group in nucleophilic addition reactions of dithiane anions. ^ The next subunit could then be appended by alkylation of the BC dithiane. Alternatively, the A and B subunits could be joined first, elaborated to aldehyde 215 followed by the addition of the C subunit. The stereochemical outcome of the dithiane anion addition reactions were proven using a combination of X-ray crystallographic analysis and, subsequently, synthetic intersection with previously prepared intermediates. ^ Elaboration of the C(27) -(R) intermediate for rapamycin (Chapter 3) and the (S) -isomer for epi- 27 -rapamycin (Chapter 4) to their respective vinyl stannanes proceeded along similar lines. Performing this sequence of reactions on the C(27) epi series demonstrated that this small change had a profound effect on substrate reactivity. Of note are the efficient dithiane group removal and the regio- and stereoselective palladium-catalyzed hydrostannylation. ^ The use of natural rapamycin in a semi-synthetic investigation allowed us to develop and implement a successful protecting group strategy for the rapamycin hydroxyl groups (Chapter 3). Uncovered in this investigation was the dramatic effect of solvent and <b>silylating</b> <b>reagent</b> on the silylation reaction of the C(10) hemiketal hydroxyl. ^ Finally, the addition of dithiane 206 to D-glyceraldehyde acetonide was shown to give the desired (R) configuration of the C 27 alcohol; this stereochemical result was proven by intersection with a known intermediate. Attempts were made to use this intermediate in a stereoselective synthesis of rapamycin (Chapter 5). ftnPlease refer to the dissertation for diagrams. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from May 29, 2016 - May 29, 2018 In this Dissertation, the mechanism and stereomechanics of complex organocatalysis and reaction processes are disclosed. The technologies and protocols currently being developed and utilized to efficiently investigate these systems using theory are highlighted. A detailed computational study of peptide-catalyzed acylations is disclosed. In particular, the magnitude of all possible non-bonding interactions in this reaction have been computed. ⁺CH•••O⁻ interactions are greater in magnitude than other non- bonding interactions in this reaction (41 - 48 vs 3 - 15 kcal/mol). This suggests that counterion effects manifested through ⁺CH•••O⁻ are critical in the transition state. The base counterion is anchored between the reactive alcohol undergoing base-catalysis and acylated N-methylimidazolium through ⁺CH•••O⁻. Considering the relative magnitudes of interactions, realization of ⁺CH•••O⁻s is of the highest priority among all other non-bonding interactions. Stereocontrol arises from {{the ability of the}} peptide to conform around a conserved, rigid substrate transition state geometry. A study of the mechanism and stereomechanics of the organocatalytic site- selective silylation of meso- 1, 2 -diols is disclosed. Previous hypotheses of the mechanics of this reaction stemmed from the reversible and rapid formation of the substrate-catalyst complex in which the substrate is preferentially bound syn to the catalyst oxazolidine i-Pr. Computed silylation barriers show that this syn-complex is part of a parasitic equilibrium and does not lead to product formation. This revises existing hypotheses about the mechanism and factors that control site-selectivity. Steric congestion involving the catalyst i-Pr groups in the transition state hinders silylation of the syn-bound substrate. Site-selectivity is mainly controlled by two factors: 1) match/mis-match between the substrate diol conformational chirality and the chiral organic catalyst, and 2) steric interactions between the <b>silylating</b> <b>reagent</b> and the catalyst-substrate complex. MIDA boronates, a coupling reagent, has been used as an increasingly general platform for building-block based small molecule construction, largely due to the dramatic and general rate differences with which they are hydrolysed under various basic conditions. Yet the mechanistic underpinnings of these rate differences have remained unclear, hindering efforts to address current limitations of this chemistry. In this Dissertation, the hydrolysis mechanism mediated by aqueous sodium hydroxide is disclosed. All computational predictions and experimental evidence lead to the conclusion that NaOH-mediated hydrolysis begins with the rate-limiting, but facile attack at a MIDA carbonyl carbon by hydroxide (∆G‡comp = 2. 2 kcal/mol). The second hydrolysis involves the attack at the boron by either hydroxide or water. Computations predicted a ¹²C/¹³C KIE of 1. 03 at the MIDA carbonyl carbon in the rate-limiting step, consistent with the experimental observed ¹²C/¹³C KIE of 1. 047. Moreover, the NaOH-mediated mechanism discovered through computations corroborate experimental observations of single ¹⁸O incorporation into MIDA after hydrolysis...|$|E
