5|$|Before {{implementing}} <b>Steam,</b> <b>Valve</b> Corporation {{had problems}} updating its online games, such as Counter-Strike; providing patches {{would result in}} most of the online user base disconnecting for several days. Valve decided to create a platform that would update games automatically and implement stronger anti-piracy and anti-cheat measures. Through user polls {{at the time of its}} announcement in 2002, Valve also recognized that at least 75% of their users had access to high-speed Internet connections, which would only grow with planned Internet expansion in the following years, and recognized that they could deliver game content faster to players than through retail channels. Valve approached several companies, including Microsoft, Yahoo!, and RealNetworks to build a client with these features, but were declined.|$|E
5|$|Two {{shipboard}} accidents {{occurred during}} Tritons post-launch fitting-out. On 2 October 1958, {{prior to the}} nuclear reactor fuel being installed, a <b>steam</b> <b>valve</b> failed during testing, causing a large cloud of steam that filled the number two reactor compartment, and on 7 April 1959, a fire broke out during the testing of a deep-fat fryer and spread from the galley into the ventilation lines of the crew's mess. Both incidents, neither nuclear related, were quickly handled by ship personnel, with Lt. Commander Leslie B. Kelly, the prospective chief engineering officer, being awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his quick action during the incident on 2 October.|$|E

25|$|On {{his first}} solo job {{erecting}} an engine at Wanlockhead Mine, Murdoch {{made the first}} of many improvements to the standard Boulton and Watt engine by rearranging the gears to enable the <b>steam</b> <b>valve</b> to be worked automatically by the action of the exhaust shaft.|$|E
25|$|In 1799 William Murdoch, {{who worked}} for the firm of Boulton and Watt, invented a new type of <b>steam</b> <b>valve,</b> called the D slide valve. This, in effect, slid {{backwards}} and forwards admitting steam to one end of the cylinder then the other. Matthew Murray improved the working of these valves by driving them with an eccentric gear attached to the rotating shaft of the engine.|$|E
500|$|The game {{regularly}} integrates puzzles, such as navigating {{a maze of}} {{conveyor belts}} or using nearby boxes to build a small staircase to the next area the player must travel to. Some puzzles involve using the environment to kill an enemy, like turning on a <b>steam</b> <b>valve</b> to spray hot steam at their enemies. There are few [...] "bosses" [...] in the conventional sense, where the player defeats a superior opponent by direct confrontation. Instead, such organisms occasionally define chapters, and the player is generally expected to use the terrain, rather than firepower, to kill the [...] "boss". Late in the game, the player receives a [...] "long jump module" [...] for the HEV suit, which allows the player to increase the horizontal distance and speed of jumps by crouching before jumping. The player must rely on this ability to navigate various platformer-style jumping puzzles in Xen {{toward the end of}} the game.|$|E
40|$|A novel coordinated {{controller}} {{is proposed}} in the paper for SVC, excitation and <b>steam</b> <b>valving</b> for a single machine infinite system. Firstly, the nonlinear mathematic model of the system including the itation and <b>steam</b> <b>valving</b> is exactly linearized via state feedback. Then, the quasi-linearized system after the exact lineariztion {{is controlled by the}} sliding model controller based on Lyapunov direct method. At last, the novel coordinated controller is compared with a traditional linear controller and a nonlinear optimal controller respectively by simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed controller gives better dynamic response and stronger robustness...|$|R

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 July 1905, Benningtons crew was {{preparing}} her to sail {{to the aid of}} the monitor [...] which had broken down and was in need of a tow. After her crew had finished the difficult task of coaling the ship that morning, most of them were belowdecks cleaning themselves from the dirty job. Unbeknownst to anyone on board, three problems with one of Benningtons boilers – oily feed water, an improperly closed <b>steam</b> <b>valve,</b> and a faulty steam gauge – were conspiring against them. At about 10:30, excessive steam pressure in the boiler resulted in a boiler explosion that rocked the ship, sending men and equipment flying into the air. The escaping steam sprayed through the living compartments and decks. The explosion opened Benningtons hull to the sea, and she began to list to starboard. Quick actions by the tug Santa Fe — taking Bennington under tow and beaching her – almost certainly saved the gunboat from sinking.|$|E
500|$|Valve has full {{authority}} to remove games {{from the service}} for various reasons; however games that are removed can still be downloaded and played by those that have already purchased these titles.

2500|$|After {{the success}} of Half-Life, the team worked on mods, spin-offs, and sequels, {{including}} Half-Life 2. All current Valve games are built on its Source engine. The company has developed six game series: Half-Life, Team Fortress, Portal, Counter-Strike, Left 4 Dead and Day of Defeat. Valve is noted for its support of its games' modding community, most prominently, Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, and Day of Defeat. Valve has branched out with this tradition to continue developing Dota 2 as the standalone sequel to the [...] mod. Each of these games began as a third-party mod that Valve purchased and developed into a full game. They also distribute community mods on <b>Steam.</b> <b>Valve</b> announced the Source 2 engine in March 2015, later porting the entirety of Dota 2 to the engine in September of that year.|$|E

2500|$|The {{solution}} to draining deep mines {{was found by}} Thomas Newcomen who developed an [...] "atmospheric" [...] engine that also worked on the vacuum principle. It employed a cylinder containing a movable piston connected by a chain to {{one end of a}} rocking beam that worked a mechanical lift pump from its opposite end. At the bottom of each stroke, steam was allowed to enter the cylinder below the piston. As the piston rose within the cylinder, drawn upward by a counterbalance, it drew in steam at atmospheric pressure. At the top of the stroke the <b>steam</b> <b>valve</b> was closed, and cold water was briefly injected into the cylinder as a means of cooling the steam. This water condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum below the piston. The atmospheric pressure outside the engine was then greater than the pressure within the cylinder, thereby pushing the piston into the cylinder. The piston, attached to a chain and in turn attached to one end of the [...] "rocking beam", pulled down the end of the beam, lifting {{the opposite end of the}} beam. Hence, the pump deep in the mine attached to opposite end of the beam via ropes and chains was driven. The pump pushed, rather than pulled the column of water upward, hence it could lift water any distance. Once the piston was at the bottom, the cycle repeated.|$|E

60|$|Even {{while the}} {{superintendent}} was speaking Will Garvie's swift mind had appreciated the idea. He had leaped down and uncoupled the Lightning from its train. John touched the whistle, let on steam and off they went {{crossed to the}} up-line (which was the wrong line of rails for any engine to run in that direction), and away he went at forty, fifty, seventy miles an hour! John knew well that he was flying towards a passenger-train, which was running towards him at probably thirty-five or forty miles an hour. He was aware of its whereabouts at that time, for he consulted his watch and had the time-table by heart. A collision with it would involve the accumulated momentum {{of more than a}} hundred miles an hour! The time was short, but it was sufficient; he therefore urged Will to coal the furnace until it glowed with fervent heat and opened the <b>steam</b> <b>valve</b> to the uttermost. Never since John Marrot had driven it had the Lightning so nearly resembled its namesake. The pace was increased to seventy-five and eighty miles an hour. It was awful. Objects flew past with flashing speed. The clatter of the engine was deafening. A stern chase is proverbially a long one; but in this case, at such a speed, it was short. In less than fifteen minutes John came in view of the fugitive--also going at full speed, but, not being so powerful an engine and not being properly managed as to the fire, it did not go so fast; its pace might have been forty or forty-five miles an hour.|$|E
