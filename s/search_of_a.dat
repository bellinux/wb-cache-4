He had in mind the island of Tubuai, 300miles south of Tahiti, partly mapped by Cook. Christian intended to pick up women, male servants and livestock from Tahiti, to help establish the settlement. As Bounty sailed slowly towards Tubuai, Bligh's launch, overcoming many dangers and hardships, made its way steadily towards civilisation and reached Coupang (now Kupang), on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Here Bligh gave his first report of the mutiny, while awaiting a ship {{to take him back}} to England.|$|E

5|$|Edwards {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film after seeing fishermen attempt to bring a creature in with a net, and imagining a monster inside. He pitched the idea to Vertigo Films, who suggested he watch In <b>Search</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Midnight Kiss, a low-budget film starring McNairy. Edwards cast McNairy and Able in the lead roles. Principal photography lasted three weeks and had a production crew of six people. Filming took place in five countries, and many locations were used without permission. Most of the extras were people who were at these locations during filming and were persuaded to act in it; all of their dialogue was improvised, and Edwards provided outlines of the primary plot points.|$|E

5|$|Star Dust (registration G-AGWH) was a British South American Airways (BSAA) Avro Lancastrian {{airliner}} which {{crashed into}} Mount Tupungato in the Argentine Andes on 2 August 1947, during {{a flight from}} Buenos Aires to Santiago, Chile. A comprehensive <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wide area (including what is now {{known to have been}} the crash site) was fruitless, and the fate of the aircraft and occupants remained unknown for over 50 years. An investigation in 2000 after wreckage of G-AGWH had been found determined that the crash was caused by weather-related factors, but until then speculation had included theories of international intrigue, intercorporate sabotage and even abduction by aliens.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarians {{who lived}} in the westernmost parts of the Pontic steppes were {{occasionally}} hired by neighboring powers to intervene in their wars. For instance, they invaded Moravia in alliance with Arnulf of East Francia in 892. Their intervention in a conflict between the First Bulgarian Empire and the Byzantine Empire caused a joint counter-invasion by the Bulgars and Pechenegs. The Hungarians were forced to leave the Pontic steppes and to cross the Carpathians in <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new homeland around 895.|$|E
5|$|The Pechenegs {{destroyed}} the Hungarians' dwelling places. Those {{who survived the}} double attack left the Pontic steppes and crossed the Carpathians in <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new homeland. The memory of the destruction brought by the Pechenegs {{seems to have been}} preserved by the Hungarians. The Hungarian name of the Pechenegs (besenyő) corresponds to the old Hungarian word for eagle (bese). Thus the 14th-century Hungarian chronicles' story of eagles compelling the Hungarians' ancestors to cross the Carpathians most probably refers to the Pechenegs' attack.|$|E
