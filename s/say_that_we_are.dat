5|$|What Arafat {{says about}} me doesn't bother me. Not only he, {{but also a}} whole list of Arab and world {{politicians}} claim that I am an agent of the Zionists or the CIA. Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E
25|$|Since {{we started}} from an {{arbitrary}} partition {{and ended up}} {{as close as we}} wanted to either zero or one, it is false to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> eventually trapped near some number , so this function is not Riemann integrable. However, it is Lebesgue integrable. In the Lebesgue sense its integral is zero, since the function is zero almost everywhere. But this is a fact that is {{beyond the reach of the}} Riemann integral.|$|E
500|$|Burnham, Ingram and Gooding {{reached the}} Shangani about 08:00, but quickly {{saw that the}} water had risen far too high for Forbes to provide any assistance. Realising the {{futility}} of turning back to Wilson without help, they decided to rejoin Forbes anyway, and to that end traversed the swollen river with considerable difficulty. They then rode to where the battle on the southern side was still going on. On reaching the main column shaken and out of breath, Burnham leapt from his horse and ran to Forbes: [...] "I think I may <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> the sole survivors of that party," [...] he quietly confided, before loading his rifle and joining the skirmish.|$|E

500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was happy}} with his players after they had come from behind to win the match: [...] "It was a {{difficult}} game. We were controlling the game, passing the ball around and then {{we made a mistake}} and had to work really hard to get back. They played well, but I think we controlled the game. To score three goals is not easy. I can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> very happy now with this trophy. Now is the time to enjoy our victory." [...] With five days of the transfer window left, Benítez refused to speculate on whether Liverpool would sign Michael Owen, stating, [...] "I like good players, {{we have a lot of}} them here." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} to his friend Harry Peach, a fellow member of the Design and Industries Association (DIA), Pick {{explained}} his choice of Holden: [...] "I may <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to build our stations upon the Morden extension railway to the most modern pattern. We are going to discard entirely all ornament. We are going to build in reinforced concrete. The station will be simply a hole in the wall, everything being sacrificed to the doorway and some notice above to tell you to what the doorway leads. We are going to represent the DIA gone mad, and in order that I may go mad in good company I have got Holden to see that we do it properly." ...|$|E
500|$|The Upper Peninsula press {{continued}} {{to report on}} Heikkinen’s every move, as he returned home shortly before Christmas, before heading west {{to play in the}} East-West Shrine Game. On his departure for California, The Bessemer Herald said: “Ralph has made every major All America team in the nation this year[...] [...] [...] Our nation has had many great men to emulate. The children of the Ramsay school not only have these in common with all others, but we have our own local hero who has gained national repute as a gentleman, scholar and last, but not least, a great athlete. To <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> proud of Ralph is putting it mild. We feel that we are very honored to have had him as a student of the Ramsay school.” ...|$|E

500|$|In {{opposition}} from 2012 to 2015, Tsakalotos {{was a key}} proponent of Syriza's economic policy. He argued that Greece needed something similar to the Marshall Plan, with a payment scheme that took into account {{the strength of the}} economy. He told Bloomberg News that [...] "People <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> responsible for the situation we find ourselves in. OK, sure. But I think that Germany will find it hard to argue that in 1953 [...] they were completely blameless." [...] He appeared in various international media as a spokesperson for Syriza and making the case for their policies: among others, he was interviewed on Lateline, an Australian news programme on ABC, by SBS, another Australian news channel, was quoted by the BBC and Bloomberg, and also appeared in an Intelligence Squared debate arguing for the motion 'Angela Merkel is Destroying Europe'.|$|E
500|$|Soon afterwards, {{the patrol}} found {{the king and}} Wilson sent a message back to the laager {{requesting}} reinforcements. Forbes, however, was unwilling to set off across the river in the dark, so he sent only 20 more men, {{under the command of}} Henry Borrow, to reinforce Wilson's patrol. Forbes intended to send the main body of troops and artillery across the river the following morning; however, the main column was ambushed by Matabele warriors and delayed. Wilson's patrol too came under attack, but the Shangani River had swollen and there was now no possibility of retreat. In desperation, Wilson sent Burnham and two other men, Pearl [...] "Pete" [...] Ingram (a Montana cowboy) and William Gooding (an Australian), to cross the Shangani River, find Forbes, and bring reinforcements. In spite of a shower of bullets and spears, the three made it to Forbes, but the battle raging there was just as intense as the one they had left, and there was no hope of anyone reaching Wilson in time. As Burnham loaded his rifle to beat back the Matabele warriors, he quietly said to Forbes, [...] "I think I may <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> the sole survivors of that party." [...] Wilson, Borrow, and their men were indeed surrounded by hundreds of Matabele warriors; escape was impossible, and all were killed.|$|E
2500|$|The issue {{prompted}} Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei to [...] "spell {{an end to}} the debates" [...] on Israel. During a Friday sermon in Tehran, he stated, [...] "It is incorrect, irrational, pointless and nonsensical to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{friends with}} the Israeli people... we are {{on a collision course with}} the occupiers of Palestine and the occupiers are the Zionist regime. This is the position of our regime, our revolution and our people." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Lord Drummond only {{wants to}} know what you wish and it shall be done," [...] said Mounser Green. Lord Drummond was the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the day.

2500|$|Sain {{commented on}} the {{experience}} of gaining a third member in a 1995 interview. [...] "I do work the shit out of my electronic equipment but there's got to be live instruments and a lot of depth as well.... It's been a long, evolutionary process, but I think it's safe to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now a threesome. We've taken on a keyboardist named Lucian, who is really quite a bizarre character. He fits in as though he was always there, it's strange." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a result, the Communist Party {{opposed the}} government, rejecting it as pro-Nazi. Perón countered the Communist complaints, saying that [...] "The excuses they seek {{are very well}} known. They <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> 'nazis', I declare we are as far from Nazism as from any other foreign ideology. We are only Argentines and want, above all, the common good for Argentines. We do not want any more [...] fraud, nor more lies. We do not want that {{those who do not}} work live from those who do".|$|E
2500|$|Birdman had {{confirmed}} that Tha Carter IV would be packaged with Rebirth as a double disc album. However, Wayne denied this idea saying that [...] "Tha Carter IV deserves Tha Carter IV". He {{went on to}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> Young Money may be packaged with Rebirth. However, in November 2009, Wayne said that the albums would be released separately. Billboard magazine received an e-mail from a customer of online retailer Amazon.com stating that Amazon.com shipped copies of Rebirth as early as December 14. Amazon shipped about 500 pre-ordered copies and blamed a [...] "shipping error". Young Money Entertainment president Mack Maine stated that the album would have different tracks {{than that of the}} leaked version.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{always talking}} over the matter," [...] Edgar objected. [...] "All the fellows {{who had a}} chance of turning out well have been tried, and I <b>am</b> sure <b>we</b> play up well together. Every one <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> beaten just because we cannot stand their rushes." ...|$|R

2500|$|In a September 2008 sermon for Friday prayers in Tehran, Khamenei {{stated that}} [...] "it is incorrect, irrational, {{pointless}} and nonsense to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> friends of Israeli people", {{because he believed}} that the occupation is done by the means of them. [...] "...usurpation of houses, lands, and business [...] are carried out using these people. They are the background actors of Zionist elements," [...] said Khamenei in his speech. [...] "...we have no problem with Jews and Christians...we have problem with the usurpers of Palestine land," [...] he added. Also, {{he said that he had}} raised the issue [...] "to spell an end to any debates". In 2013, Khamenei accused France of [...] "kneeling" [...] before Israel, while saying that Israel was led by people unworthy of the [...] "title human".|$|E
2500|$|Dyson has {{suggested}} {{a kind of}} cosmic metaphysics of mind. In his book Infinite in All Directions he writes about three levels of mind: [...] "The universe shows evidence of the operations of mind on three levels. The first level {{is the level of}} elementary physical processes in quantum mechanics. Matter in quantum mechanics is [...] constantly making choices between alternative possibilities according to probabilistic laws. [...] The second level at which we detect the operations of mind is the level of direct human experience. [...] t is reasonable to believe in the existence of a third level of mind, a mental component of the universe. If we believe in this mental component and call it God, then we can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> small pieces of God's mental apparatus" [...] (p.297).|$|E
2500|$|The broad {{combination}} of styles in the band's music {{has sometimes been}} referred to as [...] "progressive punk" [...] – or [...] "pronk" [...] – and has led to Cardiacs being labelled the primary exponents of this musical style. Tim Smith rejects the term, and prefers the description [...] "psychedelic" [...] or simply [...] "pop". Musicians which the band have cited as Cardiacs influences include XTC, Van der Graaf Generator, Gong, early Split Enz, Devo, Gentle Giant, Alberto Y Los Trios Paranoias, early Genesis, Deaf School and Wire. Smith has stated, [...] "I don’t know what influences us really, I wouldn’t <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> influenced by any actual bands in particular". Tim Smith has denied that Gentle Giant was an influence on the band, but Sarah Smith says that they were.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{will not}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> nervous, exactly, but I {{think we would}} all rather {{have been out of}} that lane. The fear that your enemy may be {{crouching}} behind bushes, that you know nothing of his presence until he pours a rifle fire into you, is rather trying on the nerves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say {{something}} original," [...] groaned Cynthia. [...] "Every {{single person}} who comes up here <b>says</b> <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> really thinking of bestowing a prize {{on the first}} individual who does not say: 'What a lot of bottles!'

6000|$|... "The Chief apologises for not {{recognising}} me," [...] he announced. [...] "It {{seems that}} Craig {{had told him}} that he had come to the desert for shelter, and he imagined at once, when he gave the order for the attack upon us, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> his enemies.

2500|$|The Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma are {{the closest}} living {{descendants}} of the Illiniwek Confederacy, having been relocated to Oklahoma in the 19th century. The position of the tribal leadership has evolved over the years. In a television interview with WICD-TV in 1995, Don Giles, then Chief of the Peoria Tribe, said, [...] "To <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> anything but proud to have these portrayals would be completely wrong. We are proud. We're proud that the University of Illinois, the flagship university of the state, a seat of learning, is drawing on that background of our having been there. And what more honor could they pay us?" [...] Supporting Chief Giles was another tribal elder, Ron Froman, who stated that the protesters [...] "don't speak for all Native Americans, and certainly not us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{the text}} read that God {{has not made}} us like the nations who [...] "bow down to nothingness and vanity, and pray to an {{impotent}} god." ... In the Middle Ages these words were censored, since the church believed they were an insult to Christianity. Omitting them tends {{to give the impression}} that the Aleinu teaches that we are both different and better than others. The actual intent is to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> thankful that God has enlightened us so that, unlike the pagans, we worship the true God and not idols. There is no inherent superiority in being Jewish, but we do assert the superiority of monotheistic belief over paganism. Although paganism still exists today, we are no longer the only ones to have a belief in one God.|$|E
2500|$|On {{returning}} to New York City in January 1937, Schneider {{claimed he was}} never paid in full. Spain claimed that they were paid in full, and were not owed any money. Others who flew for the loyalists included: Bert Acosta, Gordon Berry, and Frederic Ives Lord. When he returned he was questioned by Chief Assistant United States Attorney, John F. Dailey on January 15, 1937 in New York. Eddie's lawyer was Colonel Lewis Landes. On January 20, 1937, Eddie, Bert, and Gordon flew to Washington, D.C. and had to testify again. When talking to reporters Eddie said: I was broke, hungry, jobless... yet {{despite the fact that}} all three of us are old-time aviators who did our part {{for the development of the}} industry, we were left out in the cold in the Administration's program of job making. Can you blame us for accepting the lucrative Spanish offer? He later said [...] "This was a mess... and there was always that never-ending jockeying for the power among the factions to contend with, it got to the point where we did not know who we were fighting and why, and you can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> damn glad to be back." [...] The flyers had their passports confiscated, and they were to be returned when they attested that they had never forsworn allegiance to America.|$|E

50|$|In {{his book}} ‘Behind the Dream’ Jordan wrote (p. 161): “that great welling of {{national}} passion was extraordinary {{to see and}} you had to wonder what bed Ally was making for himself by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to win the World Cup, especially when you thought of all the European teams who had gone to South America without success”.|$|R
5000|$|Oh, totally! ...totally...and {{in those}} days we, like {{everybody}} else, I guess I could <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> naive, but then so was everybody else, ah, in, ah, taking the Communists at face value...on {{the basis of what}} they had done up to that point...which was pretty good, pretty positive.
