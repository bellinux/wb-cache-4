5|$|In 1998 a new two-tier Anfield Road end was opened. The stand has {{encountered}} {{a number of}} problems since its redevelopment; {{at the beginning of the}} 1999–2000 season, a series of support poles and <b>stanchions</b> had to be brought in to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand. During Ronnie Moran's testimonial match against Celtic, many fans complained of movement of the top tier. At the same time that the <b>stanchions</b> were inserted, the executive seating area was expanded by two rows in the main stand, lowering the seating capacity in the paddock.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{catenary}} <b>stanchions</b> on platform 4 is notably better kept than others, {{and carries}} a small plaque detailing {{the visit of}} Queen Elizabeth II on 7 May 1974, {{after the completion of}} electrification of tracks north of the point where it stands. This was significant because it marked the completion of the total electrification of the West Coast Main Line.|$|E
5|$|Anfield could {{accommodate}} {{more than}} 60,000 supporters at its peak, {{and had a}} capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Liverpool to convert Anfield to an all-seater stadium {{in time for the}} 1993–94 season, reducing the capacity to 45,276. The findings of the Taylor Report precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and <b>stanchions</b> were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported {{at the start of the}} 1999–2000 season.|$|E
40|$|The {{quantity}} of bedding consumption in {{different type of}} housing dairy cows was investigated. There was investigated the consumption of bedding in old barns with the <b>stanchion</b> length of 2, 55 m, new barn with the <b>stanchion</b> length of 1, 60 a, Louse housing without boxes and house housing with boxes. There was found that during the year the average {{quantity of}} bedding necessary to reach minimum of hygiene and comfort was per cow/day: a) 3, 64 kg of bedding in <b>stanchion</b> barns with the length of <b>stanchion</b> of 2, 55 m; b) 2, 00 kg of bedding in <b>stanchion</b> barns with the length of <b>stanchion</b> of 1, 6 m; c) over 4, 7 kg in loose housing barns without boxes; d) 2 kg in loose housing with boxes...|$|R

40|$|A {{device for}} {{manipulating}} a workpiece in space includes a fixture, a <b>stanchion</b> assembly, a manipulation mechanism, an actuation mechanism, and a reaction mechanism. The fixture has an end onto which the workpiece affixes. The <b>stanchion</b> assembly has an upper {{and a lower}} end. The manipulation mechanism connects the fixture and {{the upper end of}} the <b>stanchion</b> assembly. The lower end of the <b>stanchion</b> assembly mounts, via probe and a socket, to a structure. The actuation mechanism operably connects to the manipulation mechanism, and moves the fixture in space. The reaction mechanism provides a point through which force inputs into the actuation mechanism may react...|$|R
5|$|The only intact public rooms {{remaining}} {{in either the}} stern or bow sections are the First-Class Reception Room and Dining Saloon, both on D-Deck. Most of the Dining Saloon has collapsed because of its proximity to the break-up point midships, but the very forward part is accessible and the rectangular leaded glass windows, table bases, and ceiling lamps are noticeably preserved. The Reception Room with its leaded glass windows and mahogany paneling remains remarkably intact, although the ceiling is sagging {{and there is a}} deep layer of silt obstructing the floor. The Turkish Baths on F-Deck were found to be in excellent condition during their rediscovery in 2005, preserving the blue-green tiles, carved teak woodwork, bronze lamps, and inlaid furniture. The Grand Staircase was very likely destroyed during the sinking, but the surrounding First-Class foyers and elevator entrances preserve many of the ormolu and crystal lamps, oak timbers, and oak-framed <b>stanchions.</b>|$|E
25|$|R160As 9798-9802 have {{experimental}} looped <b>stanchions</b> {{with double}} poles in their center segments, {{instead of the}} typical single poles seen in other cars. These looped <b>stanchions</b> are meant to provide twice as many riders with poles to hold onto than in cars with single poles.|$|E
25|$|Kayak <b>stanchions</b> or kayak cockpit <b>stanchions</b> (ayapervik sg ayaperviik dual ayaperviit pl or ayaperyaraq sg ayaperyarat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, ayaperwig in Cup'ig) are {{top piece}} {{centered}} at side of coaming {{and used as}} a support as one climbs out of a kayak. They prevented the person from falling while {{getting in and out}} of the kayak. All kayaks had ayaperviik on them. This one has a woman's frowning face with a down-turned mouth carved on it. Perhaps the other side would have a man's smiling face carved on it.|$|E

50|$|In 1980, Clive Allen {{scored a}} {{spectacular}} free kick for Crystal Palace against Coventry City. The ball rebounded off the <b>stanchion</b> but the referee disallowed the goal {{as he thought}} it had just hit {{the outside of the}} <b>stanchion.</b> This was shown on Match of the Day on BBC television when it was then transmitted on Sunday afternoons.|$|R

25|$|The Eddystone Rocks were a major {{shipwreck}} hazard for mariners sailing {{through the}} English Channel. The first lighthouse built {{there was an}} octagonal wooden structure, anchored by 12 iron <b>stanchions</b> secured in the rock, and was built by Henry Winstanley from 1696 to 1698. His lighthouse was the first tower {{in the world to}} have been fully exposed to the open sea.|$|E
40|$|In Japan as in Belgium the {{cow house}} should be {{constructed}} as a single-floor-building. As well {{from the point}} of view of labour requirement;and animal health as construction costs the loose house with_ cubicles and concrete slatted floors between the cubicle rows, must be preferred above the <b>stanchion</b> barn, when the size of the herd is 25 or more cows. In Hokkaido the loose house and the <b>stanchion</b> barn should be insulated, the latter more than the former; in Honshu only the <b>stanchion</b> barn and the roof of the loose house must de insulated (K≦ 1). Natural ventilation can give complete satisfaction, when it is well regulated. When constructing a <b>stanchion</b> barn, one should build the strawless type in order to reduce labour requirement. Full attention should be given to all construction details in order to avoid injuries with the cows and save labour...|$|R

25|$|The R179s are {{equipped}} with looped <b>stanchions</b> in the interiors of trains, so as to provide passengers on crowded trains with a greater amount of pole surface area to grab on to. This feature is currently found on R160A set 9798-9802, {{in addition to the}} 100 R160s that were refurbished as part of an action plan to fix the subway's 2017 state of emergency.|$|E
25|$|The {{line was}} opened in 1911 {{to serve the}} Mont Park Asylum complex, with the {{construction}} expense met by the government Health Department. Electrification on the line was commissioned on 14 September 1928, five years after that on the main line. Steel <b>stanchions</b> were used to support the overhead wiring, {{in contrast to the}} wooden posts then used on single lines of railway in Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|Part of the {{franchise}} agreement required replacement of older rolling stock with newer models, and refurbishment of the existing rolling stock. Siemens Combino trams were purchased as the D1 and D2 class, the first of 38 D1 three-car class trams entering service on 19 December 2002 and the first of 21 five-car D2 class trams on 3 March 2004. Z3 and B2 class trams were also internally refurbished by M>Tram, receiving green seat pads, and yellow <b>stanchions</b> and grab rails.|$|E

Each car has six 15-inch LCD monitors mounted on <b>stanchions</b> and broadcasting looping daily TV news provided by Cable TV Hong Kong (Newsline Express), advertisements and safety guidelines when announcements are being broadcast. Two small video cameras are mounted in opposite positions on each car for driver to keep the train under surveillance.|$|E
25|$|The rails {{were removed}} {{after the final}} closure, except for some short {{sections}} at former level crossings which can still be seen today. From Rushall to Royal Park stations the rail reserve has become a linear park which provides part of the Capital City Trail for cyclists, connecting the Merri Creek Trail to the Moonee Ponds Creek Trail in the network of shared use bicycle paths. Some signals and parts of level crossing gates also survive, with remaining overhead <b>stanchions</b> still carrying railway electric current between the Upfield and South Morang railway lines.|$|E
25|$|For most herds, milking {{took place}} indoors twice a day, in a barn with the cattle tied {{by the neck}} with ropes or {{held in place by}} <b>stanchions.</b> Feeding could occur {{simultaneously}} with milking in the barn, although most dairy cattle were pastured during the day between milkings. Such examples of this method of dairy farming are difficult to locate, but some are preserved as a historic site for a glimpse into the days gone by. One such instance that is open for this is at Point Reyes National Seashore.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, R160Bs 8713-8722 were {{experimentally}} retrofitted with folding seats, {{video recording}} devices, pivoted grab handles, and looped <b>stanchions.</b> This {{was part of}} a pilot program designed to maximize rush hour standing space and increase capacity by 19%, in addition to increasing security throughout the system. However, due to several complaints from passengers and Kawasaki's refusal to retrofit an R142 with the same features, the pilot program was cancelled in 2012. These cars had all of these features removed and their interiors were reverted to the appearance of most other R160s. Some of the seats and pivoted handles were re-installed on two 4-car sets of R160As to address the subway's 2017 state of emergency.|$|E
25|$|Hinckley {{was founded}} in 1928 by Benjamin B. Hinckley after he {{purchased}} a small boatyard in Southwest Harbor, ME. In 1932 Benjamin’s son, Henry R. Hinckley, an engineering graduate from Cornell, {{took control of the}} company. A 36-foot “fisherman motorboat” dubbed “Ruthyeolyn” built in 1933 was Hinckley’s first boat. Five years later, in 1938, Hinckley came out with its first sailing vessel, a 28-foot Sparkman & Stephens sloop. Hinckley would go on to produce 20 of these sloops, making them the company’s first mass production line. Straying away from boatbuilding, Hinckley opened Manset Marine Supply Company in 1940 for which he designed many fittings for fuel tanks, <b>stanchions,</b> deck plates, and the like that are still utilized today.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in October 2017, {{as part of}} {{an action}} plan to fix the subway's state of {{emergency}} that year, 20 R160s typically assigned to the E train were retrofitted with features that are expected to be used on the upcoming R211 cars. The cars have a new blue and gold exterior wrap, yellow interior <b>stanchions,</b> and interior LCD information screens. The seats at the ends of the cars were removed to increase capacity by 10 passengers per car. By the end of fall 2017, a hundred R160s used on the E are expected to have these features. Also in 2017, some R160s on the L were being retrofitted with seats that folded up during rush hours. Their exteriors were also redesigned with the blue and gold wrap.|$|E
