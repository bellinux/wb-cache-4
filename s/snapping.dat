40|$|<b>SNAP</b> 25 {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in neuronal exocytosis pathways. <b>SNAP</b> 25 a and <b>SNAP</b> 25 b are alternatively spliced isoforms differing by only nine amino acids, three of which occur within the palmitoylated cysteine-rich domain. <b>SNAP</b> 23 is 60 % identical to <b>SNAP</b> 25 and has a distinct cysteine-rich domain to both <b>SNAP</b> 25 a and <b>SNAP</b> 25 b. Despite the conspicuous differences within the palmitoylated domains of these secretory proteins, there is no information on their comparative interactions with palmitoyl transferases. We report that membrane association of all <b>SNAP</b> 25 / 23 proteins is enhanced by Golgi-localized DHHC 3, DHHC 7, and DHHC 17. In contrast, DHHC 15 promoted a statistically significant increase in membrane association of only <b>SNAP</b> 25 b. To investigate the underlying cause of this differential specificity, we examined a <b>SNAP</b> 23 point mutant (C 79 F) designed to mimic the cysteine-rich domain of <b>SNAP</b> 25 b. DHHC 15 promoted a marked increase in membrane binding and palmitoylation of this <b>SNAP</b> 23 mutant, demonstrating that the distinct cysteine-rich domains of <b>SNAP</b> 25 / 23 contribute to differential interactions with DHHC 15. The lack of activity of DHHC 15 toward wild-type <b>SNAP</b> 23 was not overcome by replacing its DHHC domain with that from DHHC 3, suggesting that substrate specificity is not determined by the DHHC domain alone. Interestingly, DHHC 2, which is closely related to DHHC 15, associates with the plasma membrane in PC 12 cells and can palmitoylate all <b>SNAP</b> 25 isoforms. DHHC 2 is, thus, a candidate enzyme to regulate <b>SNAP</b> 25 / 23 palmitoylation dynamics at the plasma membrane. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of specific Golgi-localized DHHC proteins active against <b>SNAP</b> 25 / 23 proteins perturbs the normal secretion of human growth hormone from PC 12 cells...|$|R

To know about the simultaneity price of <b>snaps</b> commodity (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market. The research is done deliberately in Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market. Sampling was done with Accidental Sampling, that is by asking directly to the <b>snaps</b> merchants that have been randomly selected with a fixed respondents, there were 12 respondents for each Market in Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market for 15 days once in a day. To find the price fluctuation that happened to <b>snaps</b> commodity (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market by using descriptive analysis. To know the simultaneity price of <b>snaps</b> commodity (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market by core problem. Based on this research, the result is <b>snaps</b> price fluctuations in Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo market always changing every day. <b>Snaps</b> prices in Merjosari and Oro-Oro Dowo market was rose up because the <b>snaps</b> was distributed late so that the <b>snaps</b> amount that owned by the <b>snaps</b> merchant was slightly, causing the supply of <b>snaps</b> just a bit, whereas many requests, consequently the <b>snaps</b> prices was rose up.

If the <b>snaps</b> request is bitter from <b>snaps</b> amount that is offered so that the <b>snaps</b> price falls down. The result by using correlation formula produce the horizontal integration 0, 99 that is mean the changing of price in Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market is simultaneously.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>SNAP</b> 25 is an {{essential}} SNARE protein for regulated exocytosis in neuronal cells. Differential splicing of the <b>SNAP</b> 25 gene results in the expression of two transcripts, <b>SNAP</b> 25 a and <b>SNAP</b> 25 b. These splice variants differ by only 9 amino acids, and studies of their expression to date have been limited to analysis of the corresponding mRNAs. Although these studies have been highly informative, {{it is possible that}} factors such as differential turnover of the <b>SNAP</b> 25 proteins could complicate interpretations based entirely on mRNA expression profiles. Results We report the generation and characterization of antibodies that distinguish between <b>SNAP</b> 25 a and <b>SNAP</b> 25 b isoforms, and their use to investigate the expression profile of these proteins in rat and human brain. In rat brain, <b>SNAP</b> 25 b protein expression increased dramatically during post-natal development, whereas the increase in <b>SNAP</b> 25 a expression was more modest and variable. The extent of this up-regulation in <b>SNAP</b> 25 b expression was similar across cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. The <b>SNAP</b> 25 isoforms also displayed distinct regional expression patterns, with <b>SNAP</b> 25 a very weakly expressed in both rat and human cerebellum. Quantitative analysis revealed that <b>SNAP</b> 25 b was the dominant isoform in all adult human brain regions examined. Conclusions <b>SNAP</b> 25 a and <b>SNAP</b> 25 b display distinct developmental and regional expression profiles in rat and human brain. These differences might reflect distinct functions of these highly conserved isoforms in membrane fusion pathways in the brain. The antibodies generated and characterized in this study represent important tools for future analyses of these essential SNARE protein isoforms. </p...|$|R
