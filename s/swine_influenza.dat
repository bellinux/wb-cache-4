40|$|Background: Respiratory syncytial {{virus is}} {{a leading cause of}} acute lower {{respiratory}} tract infection in infants and young children. However, the virus is increasingly recognized as a cause of respiratory infection in adults, especially affecting the elderly and patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} exploit the recent improvements in diagnostic accuracy to better characterise and study differences in clinical, biochemical and radiological characteristics of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus infected patients, as well as to compare antibiotic usage, complication rate and mortality. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on all hospitalised adults ≥ 18 years with PCR-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), seasonal <b>influenza</b> or <b>swine</b> flu <b>influenza</b> infections, and were admitted to Akershus University Hospital, between October 2012 and April 2013. A structured review of medical records was performed and clinical, biochemical and radiological variables were assessed and compared between the cohorts. Results: 176 patients with seasonal influenza, 133 with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and 132 patients with <b>swine</b> flu <b>influenza</b> infections were included. This study did not find significant disparity between the viral infections in regards to gender, duration of symptoms, duration of hospital admission and biochemical inflammation markers. We observed that RSV and seasonal influenza displayed similar incidence throughout the season, while most patients with swine flu infection were admitted in December and January. We found that patients with RSV infection were older and had a significantly higher prevalence of concurrent chronic diseases as compared to patients with seasonal influenza (p = 0, 0007) or <b>swine</b> flu <b>influenza</b> (p < 0, 0001). Patients with RSV frequently reported dyspnoea as a major symptom in contrast to patients infected with seasonal influenza (p = 0, 0034) or <b>swine</b> flu <b>influenza</b> (p = 0, 0166). The patients with RSV infections were also frequently diagnosed with pneumonia, based on the clinical manifestations or radiological findings, in comparison to the subpopulations with seasonal influenza (p = 0, 0074) and <b>swine</b> flu <b>influenza</b> (p = 0, 0018). The majority of patients in all cohorts were treated with antibiotics i. e. 82, 7 percent, 73, 3 percent and 68, 2 percent of the patients with successively RSV, seasonal-and swine flu infections. We found no statistically significant disparity in antibiotic treatment between patients with RSV infections and those with seasonal influenza infections, however patients with swine flu infections were found less likely to be treated with antibiotics (p = 0, 0066) as compared to the aforementioned populations. Conclusion: Respiratory syncytial virus, seasonal <b>influenza</b> and <b>swine</b> flu have overlapping clinical, radiological and biochemical properties. This study found that the majority of respiratory tract infections in this population were treated with antibiotics. There is a need of further research to investigate whether improvement in diagnostic accuracy and early detection will affect the treatment of these infections and reduce to usage of antibiotics in hospital settings...|$|R
25|$|<b>Swine</b> <b>influenza</b> {{was first}} {{proposed}} to be a disease related to human flu during the 1918 flu pandemic, when pigs became ill {{at the same}} time as humans. The first identification of an influenza virus as a cause of disease in pigs occurred about ten years later, in 1930. For the following 60 years, <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> strains were almost exclusively H1N1. Then, between 1997 and 2002, new strains of three different subtypes and five different genotypes emerged as causes of influenza among pigs in North America. In 1997–1998, H3N2 strains emerged. These strains, which include genes derived by reassortment from human, swine and avian viruses, have become a major cause of <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> in North America. Reassortment between H1N1 and H3N2 produced H1N2. In 1999 in Canada, a strain of H4N6 crossed the species barrier from birds to pigs, but was contained on a single farm.|$|E

40|$|Conclusions and {{recommendations}} Following recent infections in children in North America with a swine-origin triple reassortant influenza A(H 3 N 2) virus {{that includes a}} genetic component from the pandemic 2009 virus, and with probable human-to-human transmission of these viruses, ECDC {{has come to the}} following preliminary opinion: • These viruses are known to be found in pigs in North America but they have not been found in pigs in Europe (EU/EEA countries). However, surveillance for influenza in pigs is weak in both North America and Europe, and surveillance for infections in humans in close contact with pigs is notably weak in Europe. Hence all such statements on the epidemiology of <b>swine</b> <b>influenzas</b> must be treated with caution. • Most of the US cases experienced only mild disease. Those hospitalised had underlying conditions and all patients recovered completely. • These viruses are susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) though the current A(H 3 N 2) component of seasonal influenza vaccines is unlikely to provide protection. Older people are likely to have some protection from exposure to earlier vaccines. • It is considered by the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that there had already been some very limited human-to-human transmission of these and similar viruses in the US...|$|R

25|$|Pigs {{have health}} issues of their own.

25|$|Control of <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> by {{vaccination}} {{has become}} more difficult in recent decades, as {{the evolution of the}} virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines.
