25|$|During {{the early}} years of her marriage, Caroline used her beauty, wit, and {{political}} connections, to establish herself as a major society hostess. Caroline's unorthodox behaviour and candid conversation raised more than a few eyebrows among 19th-century British high society; she made enemies and admirers in almost equal measure. Among her friends <b>she</b> <b>counted</b> such literary and political luminaries as Samuel Rogers, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Edward Trelawney, Abraham Hayward, Mary Shelley, Fanny Kemble, Benjamin Disraeli, the future King Leopold I of Belgium and William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire.|$|E

25|$|Marie Antoinette {{continued}} {{to hope that}} the military coalition of European kingdoms would succeed in crushing the Revolution. <b>She</b> <b>counted</b> most on the support of her Austrian family. After {{the death of her}} brother Joseph in 1790, his successor, Leopold, was willing to support her to a limited degree. Upon Leopold's death in 1792, his son, Francis, a conservative ruler, was ready to support the cause of the French royal couple more vigorously because he feared the consequences of the French Revolution and its ideas for the monarchies of Europe, particularly, for Austria's influence in the continent.|$|E
25|$|Since 1963, Kusama has {{continued}} her series of Mirror/Infinity rooms. In these complex infinity mirror installations, purpose-built rooms lined with mirrored glass contain scores of neon-colored balls, hanging at various heights above the viewer. Standing inside {{on a small}} platform, an observer sees light repeatedly reflected off the mirrored surfaces {{to create the illusion}} of a never-ending space. During the following years, Kusama was enormously productive, and by 1966 she was experimenting with room-size, freestanding installations that incorporated mirrors, lights, and piped-in music. <b>She</b> <b>counted</b> Judd and Joseph Cornell among her friends and supporters. However, she did not profit financially from her work. Around this time, Kusama was hospitalized regularly from overwork, and O'Keeffe convinced her own dealer Edith Herbert to purchase several works in order to help Kusama stave off financial hardship.|$|E
500|$|... In her autobiography, Living My Life, Emma Goldman {{recalled}} numerous anarchists {{from the}} warring nations of Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Germany, who she contrasted with Kropotkin for their anti-war stance during World War I. Among those in Britain, she listed Errico Malatesta, Rudolf Rocker, Alexander Schapiro, Thomas H. Keell, and [...] "other native & Jewish-speaking anarchists". In France, she noted Sébastien Faure, [...] "A. Armand" [...] (E. Armand?— ed.), and [...] "members of the anarchist & syndicalist movements". From the Netherlands <b>she</b> <b>counted</b> Domela Nieuwenhuis and [...] "his co-workers". And of Germany, she listed Gustav Landauer, Erich Mühsam, Fritz Oerter, Fritz Kater, and [...] "scores of other comrades".|$|E

Matakerepō is blind. As <b>she</b> <b>counts</b> out the ten taro tubers that are heaped in front of her, Tāwhaki removes the tenth taro when Matakerepō has reached nine. <b>She</b> <b>counts</b> again, and this time Tāwhaki removes the ninth tuber. This continues until the old woman realises that someone is deceiving her.|$|R
500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed her mind about the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. At first I thought, 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; <b>she</b> <b>counted</b> on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and I can keep up with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing {{the album}} for Idobi, Hannah Pierangelo said upon hearing {{it for the}} first time, it came across as [...] "slightly bland", due to only half of the {{material}} [...] "really carry any punch." [...] Pierangelo noted that it was missing [...] "the dynamic Cartel have proven they are capable of in previous albums." [...] <b>She</b> <b>counted</b> that after several listens, the songs [...] "grow on you" [...] and show off more [...] "substance beneath the surface". Overall, she said the band achieved [...] "to make an impact once again".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, Lane was {{reputed to be}} one of the highest-paid female writers in America, and along with Hoover, <b>she</b> <b>counted</b> among her friends well known figures such as Sinclair Lewis, Isabel Paterson, Dorothy Thompson, John Patric, and Lowell Thomas. Despite this success, her {{compulsive}} generosity with her family and friends often found her strapped for cash and forced to work on material that paid well, but did not engage her growing interests in political theory and world history. She suffered from periodic bouts of self-doubt and depression in mid-life, diagnosing herself as having Bipolar disorder. During these times of depression, she was unable to move ahead with her own writing, but would easily find work as a ghostwriter or [...] "silent" [...] editor for other well-known writers.|$|E

2500|$|... "Fragments from an Old Inn" [...] (New York, G. P. Putnam's Sons) was a {{collection}} of prose and poetry, supposed to embody the heart's history of a beautiful, sad woman whom the author met at an old inn. The prose consisted of short paragraphs, generally embracing a single thought; the poems were brief, with such titles as [...] "Old loves. An old story newly told," [...] " [...] A picture," [...] "Autumn," [...] "Disappointment," [...] and so forth. The heroine of the Hudson (and other poems) (Richmond, Virginia, The Hermitage Press, 1906) was dedicated to the National society, Daughters of the American revolution. Of [...] "The Vision of Gold," [...] {{it was said that}} there was difficulty in detecting the meaning of her rhapsodies, as they were tangled meshes of rhetorical extravagances. [...] "Columbus; or, It Was Morning" [...] was first read on July 4, 1893, before the Woman's Building Congresses of the Columbian Exposition. Messenger was also a successful dramatic reader. <b>She</b> <b>counted</b> music and painting as favored recreations.|$|E
