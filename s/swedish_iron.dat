5|$|Due to Allied {{victories}} in France and Eastern Europe, Germany's surface shipping was largely {{confined to the}} lower Baltic and Norwegian waters by late 1944. This left ports in Norway as Germany's last remaining bases to continue the Battle of the Atlantic and conduct trade with Sweden. When the Baltic iced over {{during the winter of}} 1944–45, Germany was forced to transport its vital imports of <b>Swedish</b> <b>iron</b> ore from the port of Narvik in northern Norway.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the war, a British {{blockade}} on shipments to Germany affected the Reich economy. The Germans were particularly dependent on foreign supplies of oil, coal and grain. To safeguard <b>Swedish</b> <b>iron</b> ore shipments to Germany, Hitler ordered an attack on Norway, which took place on 9 April 1940. Much of the country was occupied by German troops by the end of April. Also on 9 April, the Germans invaded and occupied Denmark.|$|E
25|$|Nazi Germany's war industry's {{dependence}} on <b>Swedish</b> <b>iron</b> ore shipments {{was the primary}} reason for Great Britain and their allies to launch their Operation Wilfred and the Norwegian Campaign in early April 1940. By early June 1940 the Norwegian Campaign stood as a failure for the allies, and by securing access to Norwegian ports by force, Nazi Germany could obtain the <b>Swedish</b> <b>iron</b> ore supply it needed for war production despite the British naval blockade.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from some}} {{production}} of puddled steel, English steel {{continued to be}} made by the cementation process, sometimes followed by remelting to produce crucible steel. These were batch-based processes whose raw material was bar <b>iron,</b> particularly <b>Swedish</b> oregrounds <b>iron.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cast iron is {{rigid and}} brittle so that {{deflection}} of the rails resulted in breakages. In 1785 a wearing surface of <b>Swedish</b> malleable <b>iron,</b> 1¾ inches broad, and ¾ {{of an inch}} thick, was tried with great success because {{of its ability to}} flex with the timber. The running resistance was also remarkably low.|$|R

25|$|<b>Swedish</b> <b>iron</b> ore from Kiruna was {{of major}} {{importance}} to the German war machine. A group of people working at LKAB organised in the Wollweberliga, planning to sabotage transports to Germany. In late November 1941, Edvard Nyberg, Ernst Wollweber and others produced a mine to {{be attached to the}} ore cars. Nyberg was caught, was fired from LKAB and spent 3½ years in prison. Upon his release, he founded Nybergs Mekaniska Verkstad which is still one of Kiruna's biggest companies.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before the}} German {{invasion}} the UK {{announced that the}} Royal Navy had laid {{out a number of}} minefields along the coast of Norway to interfere with the German import of <b>Swedish</b> <b>iron</b> ore through the North Norwegian port of Narvik. The British government claimed to have mined three areas; off Stad, Hustadvika, and Landegode north of Bodø. In response to this report, the Norwegian government ordered the minesweepers Otra and Rauma to sail north from their base in Horten and sweep the minefields on 9 April 1940.|$|E
25|$|On the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Chamberlain brought Churchill into government again in his old post of First Lord, so giving him direct responsibility {{for the conduct of}} naval operations. Churchill was required to defend the government of which he was a member, whatever his private views. He had pressed the Cabinet to ignore Norwegian neutrality, mine Norwegian territorial waters and be prepared to seize Narvik, in both cases to disrupt the export of <b>Swedish</b> <b>iron</b> ore to Germany during winter months, when the Baltic Sea was frozen. On behalf of the Admiralty, he had however advised that a major landing in Norway was not realistically within Germany's powers.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of Huntsman's technique, Sheffield produced about 200 tonnes of steel per year from <b>Swedish</b> wrought <b>iron</b> (see Oregrounds iron). The introduction of Huntsman's technique changed this radically: one hundred years later the amount had risen to over 80,000 tonnes per year, or almost half of Europe's total production. Sheffield developed from a small township into one of Europe's leading industrial cities.|$|R

The ship had been first sailed for pleasure under the name Hussar, and after her career as a research vessel entered a new career as the cruising yacht Mandalay.|$|R
25|$|The Swedish East India Company was {{established}} on 14June 1731, {{to trade in}} East Asia. The company followed the Portuguese, Dutch, Danish, French and English East India Companies.

25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{examples of}} this device were from {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century in the silver mining area of the Harz mountains, Germany, where they were driven by cranks connected to water wheels, although bucket hoists ("Hakenkunst") using the same method of operation had been used in <b>Swedish</b> <b>iron</b> mines since the 17th century. They appear to have evolved from an informal modification to the beam pumps, where the miners used spikes stuck into the wooden pump rods to get themselves carried up the shaft. As beam pumps were universal in deep mines, it was a then simple development to make proper platforms to carry the miners. The first formal engine was installed in 1833 at a mine at Clausthal, Lower Saxony, where inspector Wilhelm Albert and manager Georg Dörell (1793–1854) fastened foot platforms and hand-holds to adjacent, reciprocating pump rods, using a waterwheel-driven pump put out of use when a new drainage adit was made at a lower level. The 1837 man engine at the Samson Pit in Sankt Andreasberg in the same region is still in use, although converted from water to electric power in 1922.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, British and French {{plans to}} prevent exports of <b>Swedish</b> <b>iron</b> ore from Norwegian ports were preempted by Operation Weserübung, the German {{invasion}} of Denmark and Norway, which commenced on 9 April 1940. An under-equipped and under-trained Anglo-French force {{was sent to}} oppose the invasion and despite some moderate success {{in the north of}} Norway, the Battle of France forced a total Allied withdrawal which had been completed by 8 June, followed by the surrender of all Norwegian forces two days later. Brought to power on 10 May 1940 by the failure of the Norwegian Campaign, Churchill believed that Scandinavia was of great strategic importance and authorised a series of successful commando raids on German installations in Norway in 1941 and 1942, leading Adolf Hitler to suspect that the British intended a full scale invasion there; accordingly the German garrison had been increased from 150,000 to 250,000 men by June 1942. The German naval and air assets based in Norway were well placed to attack the British Arctic convoys, which began taking supplies to the northern ports of the Soviet Union in September 1941.|$|E

2500|$|Exchacquet's models, like Troye's, were realistically {{painted with}} glaciers made of spath (i.e. spar) and the models were about 1.40m x 40cm (about 4' 6" [...] by 1' 6"). One of Exchaquet's models still existed in 1920, having been {{presented}} to the museum of Görlitz by Baron de Gersdorf. (Baron von Gersdorff from Saxony, possibly?). Gersdorf authenticated the first ascent of Mont Blanc by Jacques Balmat and physician Michel-Gabriel Paccard in 1786.

During the Danish-Holstein-Hanseatic war, while the exports were brought to a halt, the collection of taxes continued, enraging Swedish peasants. Furthermore, the centralization of government in Denmark raised suspicions. The Swedish Privy Council wanted to retain a fair degree of self-government.|$|R

50|$|Crucible steel {{had been}} invented in the 1740s by Benjamin Huntsman of Epworth in Lincolnshire (part of the region); {{previously}} steel {{was made by}} the cementation process; the 1856 Bessemer process allowed much more steel to be made. Sheffield early steel used <b>Swedish</b> bar <b>iron</b> as it had less phosphorus. The fast acting tilting converter was a huge improvement in 1860 for Sheffield steel; the process meant high-phosphorus iron ore from local mines could be used. At one point, Sheffield was producing 10,000 tons of steel a week. The metallurgist Eric Colbeck, when working at Hadfields Limited in Sheffield, invented boron steel for control rods for nuclear reactors. Metallurgists at Firth-Vickers developed the heat-resistant stainless steel (Rex 78) for the turbine blades of Frank Whittle's first engines, and Britain's first jet aircraft. John Marshall of Yorkshire developed the first-ever iron-framed buildings (industrial mills). Sir Robert Hadfield FRS invented manganese steel in 1882, and silicon steel, which allowed the development of electromagnets and consequently electricity; the Hadfields site is now Meadowhall Centre.|$|R

50|$|A {{grand total}} of 58,450 Remington M1867 were {{delivered}} to the Norwegian Armed Forces from 1867 until 1883, when production was curtailed {{to make room for}} the Jarmann M1884.

The difference is minor; the Norwegian rifles have brass buttplates and head of the cleaning rod, and steel mounting bands, while <b>Swedish</b> rifles have <b>iron</b> furniture. For the first few years the barrels of the M1867 were made of iron, but after 1871, steel became the standardized material.

Additionally, the designers improved the lock by replacing two lockscrews with a lockplate.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} time-series {{properties}} {{of the price of}} iron ore.

New and more accurate critical values for the exogenous-break tests are calculated, and several of the asymptotic tests are accompanied by their bootstrap counterparts due to the limited sample sizes. Using unit-root tests allowing for an exogenous structural break in 1973, the null hypothesis of a unit root is rejected for three of the five series.

40|$|Due to {{increased}} globalisation, industries are facing greater competition that is pressing companies into decreasing their expenses {{in order to}} increase their profits. As regards Swedish industry, it has been faced with substantial increases in energy prices in recent years. Barriers to energy efficiency such as imperfect information inhibit investments in energy efficiency measures, energy audits being one means of reducing barriers and overcoming imperfect information. However, an evaluation of such energy audits in Sweden reveals that it is chiefly low-cost measures that are undertaken {{as a result of an}} audit. Moreover, these audits often tend to focus on support processes such as ventilation, lighting, air compressors etc., while measures impacting production processes are often not as extensively covered, which underlines the need for further support in addition to energy audits. Decision support is practised in a variety of different disciplines such as optimization and simulation and the aim of this paper is to explore whether investment decision support practices may be used successfully towards small and medium-sized manufacturers in Sweden when complex production-related investment decisions are taken. The optimization results from the different cases, involving a foundry’s investment in a new melting unit, indicate that with no electricity price fluctuations over the day, the investment seems sound as it lowers the overall energy costs. However, with fluctuating electricity prices, there are no large differences in energy costs between the option of retaining the existing five melting furnaces at the foundry and investing in a twin furnace and removing the holding furnaces – which was the initial investment plan for the foundry in the study. It would not have been possible to achieve this outcome without the use of investment decision support such as MIND. One of the main conclusions in this paper is that investment decision support, when strategic investment decisions are to be taken, may be a means of emphasising energy efficiency for energy-intensive SMEs beyond the level of traditional energy auditing.

40|$|Iron is {{the most}} {{important}} metal for modern industry and Sweden is the number one iron producer in Europe. The main sources for iron ore in Sweden are the apatite-iron oxide deposits of the "Kiruna-type", named after the iconic Kiruna ore deposit in Northern Sweden. The genesis of this ore type is, however, not fully understood and various schools of thought exist, being broadly divided into "ortho-magmatic" versus the "hydrothermal replacement" approaches. This study focuses on the origin of apatite-iron oxide ore of the Grängesberg Mining District (GMD) in Central Sweden, one of the largest iron reserves in Sweden, employing oxygen and iron isotope analyses on massive, vein and disseminated GMD magnetite, quartz and meta-volcanic host rocks. As a reference, oxygen and iron isotopes of magnetites from other <b>Swedish</b> and international <b>iron</b> ores as well as from various international volcanic materials were also analysed. These additional samples included both "ortho-magmatic" and "hydrothermal" magnetites and thus represent a basis for a comparative analysis with the GMD ore. The combined data and the derived temperatures support a scenario that is consistent with the GMD apatite-iron oxides having originated dominantly (ca. 87 %) through ortho-magmatic processes with magnetite crystallisation from oxide-rich intermediate magmas and magmatic fluids at temperatures of 600 °C to 900 °C. A minor portion of the GMD magnetites (ca. 13 %), exclusively made up of vein and disseminated ore types, is in equilibrium with a high-δ 18 O and low-δ 56 Fe hydrothermal fluid at temperatures below 400 °C, indicating the existence of a hydrothermal system associated with the GMD volcano...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{the metal}} and slag phase mixing in {{three steps of}} a ladle {{refining}} operation of steel melts and for an oxygen balance during cooling of cast iron melts have been studied at two Swedish steel plants and at two <b>Swedish</b> cast <b>iron</b> foundries, respectively. In order to predict the oxygen activity in the steel bulk in equilibrium with the top slag {{as well as in}} metal droplets in the top slag in equilibrium with the top slag, three slag models were used. In addition, the assumptions of a sulphur-oxygen equilibrium between steel and slag and the dilute solution model for the liquid steel phase were utilized in the calculations. Measured oxygen activities in steel bulk, which varied between 3. 5 - 6 ppm, were compared to predicted oxygen activities. The differences between the predicted and measured oxygen activities were found to be significant (0 - 500 %) and the reasons for the differences are discussed in the thesis. Slag samples have been evaluated to determine the distribution of the metal droplets. The results show that the relatively largest numbers of metal droplets are present in the slag samples taken before vacuum degassing. Also, the projected interfacial area between steel bulk and top slag has been compared to the interfacial area between the metal droplets and slag. The results show that the droplet-slag interfacial area is 3 to 14 times larger than the flat projected interfacial area between the steel and top slag. Furthermore, the effect of the reactions between top slag and steel and the slag viscosity on the metal droplet formation is discussed. The results show significant differences between the steel bulk and steel droplet compositions and the reasons for the differences are discussed in the thesis. The oxygen activity in different cast irons was studied. Plant trials were performed at three occasions for lamellar, compacted and nodular iron melts. The results show that at temperatures close to the liquidus temperature the oxygen activities were 0. 03 - 0. 1 ppm for LGI, around 0. 02 ppm for CGI, and 0. 001 ppm for SGI. In addition, it was found that as the oxygen activities increased with time after an Mg treatment, the ability to form a compact graphite or a nodular graphite in Mg-treated iron melts was decreased. Also, extrapolated oxygen activity differences up to 0. 07 ppm were found for different hypoeutectic iron compositions for lamellar graphite iron at the liquidus temperature. Overall, the observed differences in the dissolved oxygen levels were believed to influence how graphite particles are incorporated into the austenite matrix and how the graphite morphology will be in the cast product.
