5|$|The pass {{is above}} tree line, so the <b>surrounding</b> <b>terrain</b> is alpine tundra. Open grassy expanses are {{occasionally}} broken by low shrubbery and bare patches of rock, {{particularly on the}} steep slope to the north. Snow lingers in some areas year-round. Adjacent to the road and parking area are small ephemeral pools on the southwest, with a larger, permanent one north of the road.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons {{running into the}} Black Canyon slope in the wrong {{direction}} for water to flow into the canyon. It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>terrain.</b> The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black Canyon and could not change its course.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture roosts on high, exposed {{dead trees}} to observe <b>surrounding</b> <b>terrain.</b> When flying, it travels in pairs or alone and is rarely found in groups. Flight is heavy and steady. It flies with its wings held flat or very {{slightly}} above horizontal, {{in what is}} called the dihedral position. The flight of the greater yellow-headed is an example of static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings.|$|E

40|$|Greenstone belts are an {{important}} part of the fragmented record of crustal evolution, representing samples of the magmatic activity that formed much of the Earth's crust.

5|$|While the {{traprock}} cliffs {{remain the}} most obvious evidence of the prehistoric geologic processes of the Metacomet Ridge, the sedimentary rock of the ridge and <b>surrounding</b> <b>terrain</b> has produced equally significant evidence of prehistoric life {{in the form of}} Triassic and Jurassic fossils; in particular, dinosaur tracks. At a state park in Rocky Hill, Connecticut, more than 2,000 well preserved early Jurassic prints have been excavated. Other sites in Holyoke and Greenfield have likewise produced significant finds.|$|E
5|$|Outside the Canandaigua city limits, {{the area}} {{surrounding}} NY21 becomes rural once again; however, the <b>surrounding</b> <b>terrain</b> is more level {{than it was}} south of the city. The route heads northeast through farmland to Chapin, a small hamlet {{in the town of}} Hopewell, where it intersects the south end of NY488 and turns to take on a more northerly course. Not far to the north are the adjacent villages of Shortsville and Manchester, roughly separated by the Ontario Central Railroad. Here, NY21 passes under the railroad and intersects both NY96 and the New York State Thruway (I-90) at exit43 just north of the Manchester village center. Past the Thruway, NY21 becomes rural in nature once more as it runs across rolling terrain to the Wayne County line.|$|E
5|$|The airport {{had very}} poor {{operating}} conditions. Whenever an aircraft was to land, the cranes at the shipyard {{had to be}} moved to allow sufficient clearance. Conversely, the airport {{could not be used}} when ships were launched. The industrial buildings were located just next to the taxiway. The control tower was located such that it did not have visual sight of the entire runway. The <b>surrounding</b> <b>terrain,</b> consisting of deep fjords, mountains and a town, made it impossible to install an instrument landing system. This again meant that the airport could only be served during daylight. The airport never received a permanent operating license.|$|E
5000|$|Vega State Park is on {{the northeastern}} edge of Grand Mesa, a broad, flat-topped erosional remnant. Exposed rocks on the mesa from the Cretaceous and Tertiary eras are capped with basaltic lava flows. The lava flows created a [...] "Y" [...] shaped outcrop with a tail to the east that {{suggests}} that the lava filled an ancient stream bed.

5|$|In the 1960s, only {{a simple}} {{commemorative}} plaque {{was placed in}} the forest and the grave sites were marked with concrete borders. The plaque stated that 46,500 Soviet citizens had died and omitted mentioning nationalities. The location had been neglected and slowly degrading since. The first plans for the Bikernieki forest grave site cleanup were formed in 1986 by a team from the Komunālprojekts Institute. The team included Gaļina Lobaševa, Vija Jansone, Gaļina Alsina, Ineta Vītola, Māris Galarovskis, and Sergey Rizh in the lead. The project received Riga City Council's approval and state funding and the works continued until 1991 when the current government was dissolved after Latvia declared independence. The work halted at around a fifth of the completion with only the <b>surrounding</b> <b>terrain</b> cleared and central and entrance memorial signs erected.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's surface can {{be divided}} into several geologically {{different}} parts: cratered plains, light plains, bright and dark smooth plains, and various units associated with particular multi-ring structures and impact craters. The cratered plains constitute most of the surface area and represent the ancient lithosphere, a mixture of ice and rocky material. The light plains include bright impact craters like Burr and Lofn, as well as the effaced remnants of old large craters called palimpsests, the central parts of multi-ring structures, and isolated patches in the cratered plains. These light plains are thought to be icy impact deposits. The bright, smooth plains constitute a small fraction of Callisto's surface and are found in the ridge and trough zones of the Valhalla and Asgard formations and as isolated spots in the cratered plains. They were thought to be connected with endogenic activity, but the high-resolution Galileo images showed that the bright, smooth plains correlate with heavily fractured and knobby terrain and do not show any signs of resurfacing. The Galileo images also revealed small, dark, smooth areas with overall coverage less than 10,000km2, which appear to embay the <b>surrounding</b> <b>terrain.</b> They are possible cryovolcanic deposits. Both the light and the various smooth plains are somewhat younger and less cratered than the background cratered plains.|$|E

25|$|The lake {{occupies}} a cleft in the Baker River Valley between a prominent river terrace {{to the west}} and a less obvious one on the east.

25|$|The Smokies rise {{prominently}} {{above the}} surrounding low terrain. For example, Mount LeConte (6,593feet or 2,010m) rises {{more than a}} mile (1.6km) above its base. Because of their prominence, the Smokies receive heavy annual amounts of precipitation. Annual precipitation amounts range from 50 to 80inches (130–200cm), and snowfall in the winter can be heavy, especially on the higher slopes. For comparison, the <b>surrounding</b> <b>terrain</b> has annual precipitation of around 40 to 50inches (100–130cm).|$|E
25|$|There is {{a further}} {{subdivision}} by {{the structure of the}} battle system; in many early games, such as Wizardry, monsters and the party are arrayed into ranks, and can only attack enemies in the front rank with melee weapons.

Representations of the player characters and monsters would move around an arena modeled after the <b>surrounding</b> <b>terrain,</b> attacking any enemies that are sufficiently near.|$|E
30|$|Impact craters are {{the sites}} of past meteor impacts, {{generally}} found on planetary surfaces, which is a bowl-shaped depression surrounded by raised rims and radially emanating ejecta deposits. Most of the mounds exist {{in the absence of}} these characteristics. Though some of the mounds show the smooth materials overlying the <b>surrounding</b> <b>terrains</b> and distinct crater on the summit with raised rims having ejecta-like boulders (e.g. Fig.  4) similar to the morphology of typical impact craters, the depths of summit depression are too shallow to reach the elevations of the surrounding plains, which is difficult to explain the pitted mounds by the impact origin. We thus concluded that the impact origin is unlikely.|$|R
