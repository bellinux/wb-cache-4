40|$|Missing {{data are}} almost always a problem in {{longitudinal}} research. Item non-response, differential attrition, failure to obtain measurements at equal time intervals, and unbalanced panel designs used {{to be difficult to}} analyze at best and remain a threat to the validity of a study. A related technical problem, customarily given little importance but nevertheless strongly related to validity threats, is that most multivariate methods require complete data. Incomplete data are often dealt with by listwise or pairwise deletion methods, which omit entire records, or pairs of variables, with missing values. Sometimes a researcher will <b>substitute</b> <b>sample</b> means for the missing values. All three approaches aim to fix up the data {{so that they can be}} analyzed by methods designed for complete data but are ad hoc and have little theoretical justification. The method of full-information maximum likelihood (FIML), in contrast, has long been known as a theory-based approach to the treatment of missing data. FIML assumes multivariate normality, and maximizes the likelihood of the model given the observed data. The theoretical advantages of this fullinformation method are widely recognized, and it is now implemented in the Amos and Mx structural equation modeling programs. Unfortunately, theory has not had much influence on practice in the treatment of missing data. In part, th...|$|E

The {{comparison}} substitution with K, Ca and Zn respectively at the Cu site of YBa 2 Cu 3 -xMxOδ (x = 0. 00 and 0. 20) {{was performed}} based on superconducting and structural properties. All samples were prepared via a solid state technique. Resistivity and current density measurements (zero magnetic fields) were done using the four probe method and the structural and morphological properties were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) respectively. The critical current density (Jc) and critical temperature (Tc zero) of the <b>substituted</b> <b>samples</b> {{were found to}} be lower than that of the pure sample. Tc zero with K and Zn substitution was 78 K and 21 K respectively. This is due to the change in the hole concentration.

An upturn in the resistivity is observed in all Ni <b>substituted</b> <b>samples</b> as the temperature is lowered, suggestive of the occurrence of a Metal-Insulator Transition (MIT). The temperature at which this transition occurs increases with Ni content. The temperature dependence of the resistivity in the metallic region in the Ni <b>substituted</b> <b>samples</b> shows a T 2 dependence, which is qualitatively different from that observed in the pristine sample. The evolution of the Fano asymmetry parameter, extracted by analyzing the lineshape of the IR active in-plane Co-O mode, both as a function of Ni concentration and temperature corroborates the occurrence of the MIT. It is argued that the progressive substitution of the Co 4 + ions with Ni increases the probability of double occupancy and therefore the on-site Coulomb interaction energy leading to a shift in the thermodynamically driven MIT to higher temperatures.

Several important traits of these materials are now apparent, for example, layers of iron tetrahedrally coordinated by arsenic are crucial structural ingredients.
