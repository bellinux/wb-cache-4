2500|$|Official {{conduct that}} does not invade a {{reasonable}} expectation of privacy is not a [...] "search" [...] under the Fourth Amendment. The possession of contraband is not anything {{in which a person}} can have a legitimate expectation of privacy, since it is by definition illegal to possess contraband. In United States v. Place (1983), the Court had held that a dog sniff is sui generis because it discloses only {{the presence or absence of}} narcotics. By contrast, the information disclosed by the heat <b>sensing</b> <b>device</b> in Kyllo v. United States (2001) disclosed the [...] "intimate details in a home, such as at what hour each night the lady of the house takes her daily sauna and bath." [...] People have a reasonable expectation that such information will be kept private, whereas they have no such expectation in the fact they possessed contraband. Thus, the use of a drug-sniffing dog does not intrude upon any reasonable expectation of privacy, and it was not unreasonable for the Illinois police to use the dog during the time it took them to issue a warning to Caballes.|$|E
2500|$|On October 28, 2015, {{one of two}} JLENS aerostats {{being used}} to conduct a test over Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland, became untethered. It was escorted by two fighter jets as it drifted at an {{altitude}} of approximately 16,000 feet towards Pennsylvania. About three hours later, it was reported by NORAD to be approaching the ground near Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, about 100 miles north of Aberdeen. Its dragging [...] tether reportedly downed many power lines in the area, with loss of electrical power to as many as 20,000 area residents. The Pennsylvania State Police reported less than an hour later that the aerostat was [...] "contained". It was found tangled in trees in Anthony Township, Pennsylvania. The Pentagon suspended trials of the system after the incident until the Army completed its investigation of how the aerostat broke free. The program was said to be [...] "hanging by a thread" [...] after the incident. By February 2016, the investigation had found that a malfunctioning pressure <b>sensing</b> <b>device</b> caused a loss of air pressure in the tail fins, leading to the loss of aerodynamic efficiency which, along with increased wind drag, exacerbated tension on the tether to the point of breakage. [...] Following the incident, the military initially decided that the JLENS should continue with its operational exercise because of the unique cruise-missile defense capability it provides, determining that changes and procedures will enable it to safely fly again.|$|E
