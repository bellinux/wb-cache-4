BACKGROUND: The purpose and {{contribution}} of <b>supplementary</b> <b>search</b> methods in systematic reviews is increasingly acknowledged. Numerous studies have demonstrated their potential in identifying studies or study data that would have been missed by bibliographic database searching alone. What is less certain is how <b>supplementary</b> <b>search</b> methods actually work, how they are applied, and the consequent advantages, disadvantages and resource implications of each search method. The aim of this study is to compare current practice in using <b>supplementary</b> <b>search</b> methods with methodological guidance. METHODS: Four methodological handbooks in informing systematic review practice in the UK were read and audited to establish current methodological guidance. Studies evaluating the use of <b>supplementary</b> <b>search</b> methods were identified by searching five bibliographic databases. Studies were included if they (1) reported practical application of a <b>supplementary</b> <b>search</b> method (descriptive) or (2) examined the utility of a <b>supplementary</b> <b>search</b> method (analytical) or (3) identified/explored factors that impact on the utility of a supplementary method, when applied in practice. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies were included in this review in addition to the four methodological handbooks. Studies were published between 1989 and 2016, and dates of publication of the handbooks ranged from 1994 to 2014. Five <b>supplementary</b> <b>search</b> methods were reviewed: contacting study authors, citation chasing, handsearching, searching trial registers and web searching. CONCLUSIONS: There is reasonable consistency between recommended best practice (handbooks) and current practice (methodological studies) as it relates to the application of <b>supplementary</b> <b>search</b> methods. The methodological studies provide useful information on the effectiveness of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>search</b> methods, often seeking to evaluate aspects of the method to improve effectiveness or efficiency.

40|$|Objective: The {{research}} investigated whether {{conducting a}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>search</b> of PubMed {{in addition to}} the main MEDLINE (Ovid) search for a systematic review is worthwhile and to ascertain whether this PubMed search can be conducted quickly and if it retrieves unique, recently published, and ahead-of-print studies that are subsequently considered for inclusion in the final systematic review. Methods: Searches of PubMed were conducted after MEDLINE (Ovid) and MEDLINE In-Process (Ovid) searches had been completed for seven recent reviews. The searches were limited to records not in MEDLINE or MEDLINE In-Process (Ovid). Results: Additional unique records were identified for all of the investigated reviews. Search strategies were adapted quickly to run in PubMed, and reviewer screening of the results was not time consuming. For each of the investigated reviews, studies were ordered for full screening; in six cases, studies retrieved from the <b>supplementary</b> PubMed <b>searches</b> were included in the final systematic review.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{undertook}} a systematic review {{to evaluate the}} health benefits of environmental enhancement and conservation activities. We were concerned that a conventional process of study identification, focusing on exhaustive searches of bibliographic databases as the primary search method would be ineffective, offering limited value. The focus of this study is comparing study identification methods. We compare: (i) an approach led by searches of bibliographic databases to (ii) an approach led by <b>supplementary</b> <b>search</b> methods. We retrospectively assessed the effectiveness and value of both approaches. METHODS: Effectiveness' was determined by comparing: 1) the total number of studies identified and screened and, 2) the number of includable studies uniquely identified by each approach. 'Value' was determined by comparing included study quality and by using qualitative sensitivity analysis to explore the contribution of studies to the synthesis. RESULTS: The bibliographic databases approach identified 21, 409 studies to screen and two included qualitative studies were uniquely identified. Study quality was moderate and contribution to the synthesis was minimal. The <b>supplementary</b> <b>search</b> approach identified 453 studies to screen and nine included studies were uniquely identified. Four quantitative studies were poor quality but made a substantive contribution to the synthesis; Five studies were qualitative: three studies were good quality, one was moderate quality, and one study was excluded from the synthesis due to poor quality. All four included qualitative studies made significant contributions to the synthesis.

40|$|Abstract Background For {{systematic}} reviews providing {{evidence for}} policy decisions in specific geographical regions, {{there is a}} need to minimise regional bias when seeking out relevant research studies. Studies on people’s views tend to be dispersed across a range of bibliographic databases and other search sources. It is recognised that a comprehensive literature search can provide unique evidence not found from a focused search; however, the geographical focus of databases as a potential source of bias on the findings of a research review is less clear. This case study describes search source selection for research about people’s views and how <b>supplementary</b> <b>searches</b> designed to redress geographical bias influenced the findings of a systematic review. Our research questions are: a) what was the impact of search methods employed to redress potential database selection bias on the overall findings of the review? and b) how did each search source contribute to the identification of all the research studies included in the review? Methods The contribution of 25 search sources in locating 28 studies included within a systematic review on UK children’s views of body size, shape and weight was analysed retrospectively. The impact of utilising seven search sources chosen to identify UK-based literature on the review’s findings was assessed. Results Over a sixth (5 out of 28) of the studies were located only through <b>supplementary</b> <b>searches</b> of three sources. These five studies were of a disproportionally high quality compared with the other studies in the review. The retrieval of these studies added direction, detail and strength to the overall findings of the review. All studies in the review were located within 21 search sources. Precision for 21 sources ranged from 0. 21 % to 1. 64 %. Conclusions For reducing geographical bias and increasing the coverage and context-specificity of systematic reviews of people’s perspectives and experiences, searching that is sensitive and aimed at reducing geographical bias in database sources is recommended. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Communication is {{fundamental}} to human interaction and the development and maintenance of human relationships and is frequently affected in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, research and clinical practice have both {{tended to focus on}} impairment rather than participation aspects of communicative deficit in PD. In contrast, people with PD have reported that it is these participation aspects of communication that are of greatest concern to them rather than physical speech impairment. Objective: To systematically review the existing body of evidence regarding the association between cognitive status and/or intelligibility and everyday communication in PD. Methods: Five online databases were systematically searched in May 2015 (Medline Ovid, EMBASE, AMED, PsycINFO and CINAHL) and <b>supplementary</b> <b>searches</b> were also conducted. Two reviewers independently evaluated retrieved records for inclusion and then performed data extraction and quality assessment using standardised forms. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they were English-language original peer-reviewed research articles, book chapters or doctoral theses investigating the associations between at least one of cognitive status and level of intelligibility impairment and an everyday communication outcome in human participants with PD. Results: 4816 unique records were identified through database searches with 16 additional records identified through <b>supplementary</b> <b>searches.</b> 41 articles were suitable for full-text screening and 15 articles (12 studies) met the eligibility criteria. 10 studies assessed the role of cognitive status and 9 found that participants with greater cognitive impairment had greater everyday communication difficulties. 4 studies assessed the role of intelligibility and all found that participants with greater intelligibility impairment had greater everyday communication difficulties, although effects were often weak and not consistent. Conclusions: Both cognitive status and intelligibility may be associated with everyday communicative outcomes in PD. The contribution of intelligibility to everyday communication appears to be of small magnitude, suggesting that other factors beyond predominantly motor-driven impairment-level changes in intelligibility may {{play an important role in}} everyday communication difficulties in PD...|$|R

However, the article details the improvements that can be made to title and abstracts, and the added value supplied by classification information and by the <b>search</b> <b>reports,</b> particularly in the written opinions of the Extended European <b>Search</b> <b>Report.</b> The additional actions taken by the EPO internally to improve and maintain quality are also outlined. These include routine checks on applications, extensive training, and limited full personal responsibility until examiners are both fully trained and experienced. In addition, a more detailed quality audit on a proportion of completed applications is carried out, and also a procedure before action is completed is taken at the technical cluster level. Whilst the article comments on EPO procedure, it is the opinion of the author alone and is not an official EPO view.

40|$|The MIDI {{automated}} Microbial Identification System (MIS) uses {{gas chromatography}} (GC) analysis of whole-cell fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) between 9 and 20 carbons in length to characterize {{a wide range}} of bacterial genera and species, including mycobacteria. Mycolic acid cleavage products (MACPs) with chain lengths of C 22 to C 26 are not released by MIDI sample preparation of mycobacteria. Therefore, the MIS library <b>search</b> <b>report</b> often matches several mycobacterial species without any significant difference in the similarity indices. The problem is solved by adding trimethylsulfonium hydroxide (TMSH) instead of sodium sulfate in the last step of sample preparation, thus allowing the identification of MACPs in addition to FAMEs. Only one GC run parameter has to be changed: the temperature program must be extended from 260 to 310 °C. The MIS library <b>search</b> <b>report</b> for the identification of bacteria is not disturbed by TMSH. The combination of conventional library <b>search</b> <b>report</b> with the information of typical MACP patterns yields significantly better discrimination of mycobacterial species than the MIDI method allows.

40|$|Context. Systematic reviews play an {{important}} role in evidence based health promotion. The search and selection methods are at the heart of a systematic review. ^ Objective. To evaluate the <b>search</b> methods, <b>search</b> <b>reporting,</b> and selection methods of reviews of physical activity interventions to prevent obesity. ^ Methods. Review articles focusing on physical activity for obesity prevention were retrieved from a list of sources suggested by Cochrane Public Health Group for health promotion/public health reviews. The <b>search</b> methods, <b>search</b> <b>reporting,</b> and selection methods of each review will be evaluated using checklists developed from Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Systematic Reviews of Health Promotion and Public Health Interventions: Guidelines. <b>Search</b> <b>reporting</b> was also be evaluated using another checklist known as STARLITE (Sampling strategy, Type of studies, Approaches, Range of years, Limits, Inclusion and exclusions, Terms used, and Electronic sources). ^ Results. 31 articles were evaluated with the following principal findings: most (64 %) of the reviews reported 2 or less of the 5 required Cochrane Handbook search approaches; number of databases searched ranged from 1 to 8 (median of 4); only 23 % of the articles provided a complete search strategy; the average search precision was 1. 12 %; and most (61 %) of the reviews did not report any element of the selection methods. ^ Conclusion. The reviews evaluated ranged widely in the depth of the search and level of clarity in search and screening processes. When complete methods are not provided, it is difficult to evaluate the research. While standards for <b>searching,</b> <b>search</b> <b>reporting,</b> and screening procedures are available, awareness and application of the standards has yet to take place in the area of reviewing physical activity interventions with focus on preventing obesity. ...|$|R
