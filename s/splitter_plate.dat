25|$|The IAI Lavi was a single-seat, {{single-engine}} multirole fighter aircraft, principally {{designed to}} conduct high-speed penetration and first-pass bombing missions {{while maintaining a}} high level of manoeuvrability and survivability. It bore considerable similarities in terms of external appearance to the American F-16 fighter, having a similar configuration and several shared design features while being a slightly smaller aircraft. The engine air intake took the form of a plain chin type scoop with a <b>splitter</b> <b>plate,</b> externally resembling that of the F-16, yet internally it was substantially different, not exposing the engine compressor stage forwards (inverse S-duct), thus drastically minimizing the frontal cross-sections of IR and radar alike. In comparison to the F-16, the Lavi was furnished with a less powerful engine and a consequently lower thrust-to-weight ratio.|$|E
500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the XF-104 {{had a high}} fineness ratio, i.e., tapering sharply {{towards the}} nose, and a small frontal area of [...] The fuselage was tightly packed, containing the cockpit, avionics, cannon, all internal fuel, landing gear, and engine. The air intakes, designed by Ben Rich, were of fixed geometry without inlet cones, since the J65-powered aircraft was incapable of Mach2 performance. They {{were similar to those}} of the F-94 Starfire, being mounted slightly away from the fuselage, with an inner <b>splitter</b> <b>plate</b> for the boundary layer bleed air. The combination of these features provided extremely low drag except at high angle of attack, at which point induced drag became very high.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{proposed}} utility of splitter-plate wake stabilisation as a passive control mechanism for vortexinduced vibration (VIV) mitigation for low aspect ratio cylinders. Stationary cylinder experiments have repeatedly demonstrated {{the effectiveness of}} <b>splitter</b> <b>plates</b> in reducing lift and drag coefficients for a cylinder in uniform flow. Rigid attached <b>splitter</b> <b>plates</b> {{have been shown to}} be capable of completely eliminating vortex shedding in fixed cylinder investigations. In the limited number of studies that have examined the use of <b>splitter</b> <b>plates</b> in a system which is free to vibrate in the direction transverse to the flow, a galloping-type response has been reported. A range of splitter-plate ratios (l/D = 0 to 4) was examined in this study over a reduced velocity interval of Ur = 3 to 60. A galloping-type response was observed with the addition of even small <b>splitter</b> <b>plates</b> to the cylinder. At small splitter-plate ratio (l/D), the response of the low aspect ratio cylinders appeared to be strongly influenced by vortex shedding, and key features such as the abrupt decrease in the galloping response at higher reduced velocity aligned well with the bare cylinder VIV response. With increasing splitter-plate ratio, there appears to be a smooth transition from pure VIV (i. e., at l/D = 0) to a galloping-type response heavily influenced by the vortex shedding at low reduced velocity and a predominantly galloping response at high reduced velocity. At higher splitter-plate lengths (l/D ≥ 28), no significant VIV or galloping-type response was observed...|$|R

500|$|The F-16 has a cropped-delta wing {{incorporating}} wing-fuselage blending and forebody vortex-control strakes; a fixed-geometry, underslung {{air intake}} (with <b>splitter</b> <b>plate)</b> {{to the single}} turbofan jet engine; a conventional tri-plane empennage arrangement with all-moving horizontal [...] "stabilator" [...] tailplanes; a pair of ventral fins beneath the fuselage aft of the wing's trailing edge; and a tricycle landing gear configuration with the aft-retracting, steerable nose gear deploying a short distance behind the inlet lip. There is a boom-style aerial refueling receptacle located behind the single-piece [...] "bubble" [...] canopy of the cockpit. Split-flap speedbrakes are located at the aft end of the wing-body fairing, and a tailhook is mounted underneath the fuselage. A fairing beneath the rudder often houses ECM equipment or a drag chute. Later F-16 models feature a long dorsal fairing along the fuselage's [...] "spine", housing additional equipment or fuel.|$|E
500|$|The XB-70 used {{compression}} lift, which {{arose from}} a shock wave {{generated by the}} sharp {{leading edge of the}} central engine intake <b>splitter</b> <b>plate</b> below the wing. [...] At Mach 3 cruising speed, the shock wave attached along the wing leading edge, preventing the high pressure behind the shock front from leaking up over the wing. The compression lift provided five percent of the total lift. The wing included inboard camber to more effectively use the higher pressure field behind the strong shock wave. Unique among aircraft of its size, the outer portions of the wings were hinged, and could be pivoted downward by up to 65 degrees, acting almost as a type of variable-geometry wingtip device. This increased the aircraft's directional stability at supersonic speeds, shifted the center of lift to a more favorable position at high speeds, and strengthened the compression lift effect. With the wingtips drooped downwards, the compression lift shock wave would be further trapped under the wings.|$|E
2500|$|The Typhoon is {{a highly}} agile {{aircraft}} at both supersonic and low speeds, achieved through having an intentionally relaxed stability design. It has a quadruplex digital fly-by-wire control system providing artificial stability, as manual operation alone could not compensate for the inherent instability. The fly-by-wire system is described as [...] "carefree", and prevents the pilot from exceeding the permitted manoeuvre envelope. Roll control is primarily achieved by use of the wing elevons. Pitch control is by operation of the foreplanes and elevons, the yaw control is by rudder. [...] Control surfaces are moved through two independent hydraulic systems, which also supply various other items, such as the canopy, brakes and undercarriage; powered by a 4,000psi engine-driven gearbox.

Using the laser sheet visualization, the expansion rate was observed to have certain boundaries which followed a structured pattern. When the laser sheet visualization was applied to the counter flow, several interactions were noted that included, but were not limited to, vortex generation. I.

This study investigates the fluid forces acting on a circular cylinder in a laminar flow regime while using a passive control strategy. Three cases including the cylinder with one, two or three rigid <b>splitter</b> <b>plates</b> attached at its rear surface were considered {{and the location of}} horizontal plates (attachment angle) was varied between 0 ° and 90 °. A comprehensive parametric study was performed to identify the optimum arrangement of the plates using the commercial finite element software, Comsol Multiphysics. The results show that the location and the number of the plates have crucial effects on the wake control. Increasing the number of <b>splitter</b> <b>plates</b> from one to two symmetric parallel plates led to a reduction in drag force, vortex shedding frequency and fluctuation of lift force. A maximum drag reduction of 23 % for dual-splitters and 15 % for single-splitter was achieved, at an angle of 45 ° at Reynolds number 100. However, increasing the number of attached plates to three didn’t {{have a significant effect on}} flow quantities when plates of the same length were utilised. The suitability of the third plate (the middle plate) was further studied by investigating the effect of length of the plate on flow quantities...|$|R

50|$|The use of {{composites}} {{resulted in}} a 40% reduction in {{the total number of}} parts, including half the number of fasteners required, compared to a metallic frame design.
