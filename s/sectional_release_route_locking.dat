40|$|International {{audience}} Railway {{operations management}} must cope with {{failures of the}} railway system and with external disturbances that may cause initial delays, the so-called primary delays. In heavy traffic areas of railway networks, primary delays can quickly lead to many further delays, called secondary delays or knock-on delays. This paper describes {{the results of an}} experimental analysis which aims to evaluate the ability of railway traffic optimization tools to decrease secondary delays, by selecting appropriate route settings and sequences of train movements. We have previously proposed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation to tackle this problem (Pellegrini, P., Marlière, G. and Rodriguez, J. 2013. Optimal train routing and scheduling for managing traffic perturbations in complex junctions, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, to appear). This formulation considers a fine granularity of the infrastructure and it takes into account a large number of commercial and technical aspects characterizing real situations, e. g., passenger and rolling stock connections between trains, signal watching times, different numbers of signaling aspects, <b>sectional</b> <b>route</b> <b>release</b> of the interlocking systems. The experiments reported in this paper have been carried out {{in the context of the}} ON-TIME European project ([URL] This project aims to develop a prototype for a new generation of railway traffic management systems which will increase capacity and decrease delays, for augmenting customers' satisfaction. The results of the project will be validated through system simulation and real-life case studies proposed by different railway undertakings partners of the project. </p...|$|R

50|$|A {{road that}} {{stretched}} from Raleigh to Fayetteville crossed the Cape Fear River via the Northington Ferry {{and served as}} the area's major transportation <b>route.</b> <b>Locks</b> and dams were built along the river to facilitate navigation by boat, and Raven Rock became an important landmark for river pilots. After a hurricane destroyed the locks and dams in 1859, the structures were not replaced; railroad transportation eliminated the need for river travel. As new roads were built, the ferry was closed and Raven Rock became a popular recreation spot. The remnants of the Northington lock and dam can still {{be seen in the}} park.|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{improving}} the passing capacity of a station without adding any track and equipment is proposed in this paper. In the process of handling train routes, by transforming the existing fixed train-approaching locking section into a variable mode, the <b>route</b> <b>locking</b> time is shortened and in-station resource consumption is reduced. This approach improves {{the capacity of the}} station. At the same time, delay of the train can be quickly returned to normal. A method of variable train-approaching locking section is discussed; a mathematical model for increasing station passing capacity is shown. Comparison between the impact of a variable train-approaching locking section and a fixed mode on the station passing capacity is shown...|$|R

5000|$|Winchester Chesil {{station was}} chosen for an {{innovative}} system of signalling, developed in about 1923 by L M G Ferreira of Siemens Brothers and Co Ltd and R J Insell of the GWR. A route setting frame was installed, with miniature levers: the frame was small, measuring 2 ft 10 in by 2 ft 4 in (863 mm by 711 mm). It was a forerunner of the one control switch system; the levers set up routes; when the lever was moved to mid-stroke the interlocking proved that the route was free and no conflicting move had been set up; and the points moved to the required position, after which the lever could be moved to the reverse position and the signal cleared. There were 16 miniature levers and 15 routes could be selected; the sixteenth was a king lever. The points were operated by a 120-volt supply from the signal box. Track circuits were provided at the points: they were described as [...] "point protection tracks", that is, <b>route</b> <b>locking</b> track circuits, {{but there were no}} track circuits in the plain line. The night illumination was provided by oil lamps except for two signals located in the tunnel; ground signals were miniature semaphores of novel design.|$|R

Sometimes this is done to allow a film to receive a wide release shortly after the first of the year, while qualifying for the previous year's Academy Awards. Often, smaller films (often art and independent) will receive an initial release in New York and Los Angeles, and later expand to other cities based on results; this is called [...] "platforming" [...] or a platform release.|$|R
