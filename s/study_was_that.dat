5|$|Another {{finding of}} this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Aetosauroides lies outside Stagonolepididae.

25|$|Documents {{were found}} in Shanghai that showed details of how the Japanese Army went about opening comfort {{stations}} for Japanese troops in occupied Shanghai. Documents included the Tianjin Municipal Archives from the archival files of the Japanese government and the Japanese police during the periods of the occupation in World War II. Municipal archives from Shanghai and Nanjing were also examined. One conclusion reached was that the relevant archives in Korea are distorted. A conclusion of the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese Imperial government, and the colonial government in Korea, tried to avoid recording the illegal mobilization of comfort women. It was concluded that they burned most of the records immediately before the surrender; but, the study confirmed that some documents and records survived.|$|E
25|$|A further {{significant}} finding of Preston's <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the curve has shifted upwards during the 20th century. This means that life expectancy {{has increased in}} most countries, independently of changes in income. Preston credited education, better technology, vaccinations, improved provision of public health services, oral rehydration therapy and better nutrition with these exogenous improvements in health. According to Preston, the independent increases in life expectancy have been greatest in the poor countries, although he also believed that {{a good portion of}} the potential gains from better medical technology have not been realized. Several poor countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have actually seen declines in life expectancy in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, even if their per capita incomes have increased during this time.|$|E

2500|$|A 2007 {{consultation}} report [...] "Christchurch Rolleston Transportation Study" [...] {{found that}} 9% {{of the people}} who provided feedback wanted rail to have a greater role in the transport network and were concerned about the possibility of losing future options for developing rail links. [...] One of the conclusions of the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> rail is not a viable option for public transport within the scope of the study (until 2021). [...] In December 2007, the Selwyn District Council approved the Christchurch, Rolleston and Environs Transportation Study, of which a key component is the protection of the railway corridor between Rolleston and central Christchurch for future commuter use.|$|E

[...] The conclusion of the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the HRT combination presented risks that outweighed its measured benefits. The results were almost universally reported as risks and problems associated with HRT in general, rather than with Prempro, the specific proprietary combination of conjugated equine estrogen and progestin studied.|$|E

2500|$|A {{high-throughput}} study, which denotes {{technology that}} looks at extensive genetic markers, focused on epigenetic differences between monozygotic twins to compare global and locus-specific changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications {{in a sample of}} 40 monozygotic twin pairs. In this case, only healthy twin pairs were studied, but a wide range of ages was represented, between 3 and 74 years. One of the major conclusions from this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there is an age-dependent accumulation of epigenetic differences between the two siblings of twin pairs. This accumulation suggests the existence of epigenetic “drift”. Epigenetic drift is the term given to epigenetic modifications as they occur as a direct function with age. While age is a known risk factor for many diseases, age-related methylation ...|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Potter, the {{director}} of the Clinical Effectiveness and Evaluation Unit of the Royal College of Physicians stated in 2009 that their audits showed that [...] "where the Liverpool Care Pathway for the dying patient (LCP) is used, people are receiving high quality clinical care in the last hours and days of life". The 2009 audit looked at end-of-life care in 155 hospitals, and examined the records of about 4,000 patients. A major criticism of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> each of the participating hospitals was only asked to submit datasets from 30 patients: arguably, the study was heavily biased by the ability to [...] "cherry-pick" [...] the most favourable datasets, and the lack of availability of all data for independent scrutiny and objective assessment.|$|E
2500|$|Muralitharan {{continued}} bowling, {{taking his}} 500th Test wicket {{in the second}} Test against Australia in Kandy on [...] 2004. At {{the end of the}} series his doosra delivery was officially called into question by match referee Chris Broad. At the University of Western Australia (Department of Human Movement and Exercise Science), three-dimensional kinematic measurements of Muttiah Muralitharan's bowling arm were taken using an optical motion capture system while he bowled his doosra. Muralitharan's mean elbow extension angle for the doosra delivery was 14°, which was subsequently reduced to a mean of 10.2° after remedial training at the University. The findings reported to ICC by the University of Western Australia's <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Muralitharan's doosra contravened the established ICC elbow extension limit of 5° for spinners.|$|E

2500|$|Certain breeds {{use their}} tails as rudders when swimming, and {{possibly}} for balance when running, so active dogs with docked tails {{might be at}} a disadvantage compared to their tailed peers. In 2007, Stephen Leaver, {{a graduate student at}} the University of Victoria, published a paper [...] on tail docking which found that tail length was important in the transmission of social cues. The study found that dogs with shorter tails (docked tails) would be approached with caution, as if the approaching dog was unsure of the emotional state of the docked dog. The study goes on to suggest that dogs with docked tails may grow up to be more aggressive. The reasoning postulated by Tom Reimchen, UVic Biologist and supervisor of the <b>study,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> dogs who grew up without being able to efficiently transmit social cues would grow up to be more anti-social and thus more aggressive.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{research}} on perceptions of science among the American public concludes that most religious groups see no general epistemological conflict with science {{or with the}} seeking out of scientific knowledge, although there may be epistemic or moral conflicts when scientists make counterclaims to religious tenets. Even strict creationists tend to have very favorable views on science. [...] Also, cross-national studies, polled from 1981-2001, on views of science and religion have noted that countries with higher religiosity do not have stronger trust in science, whereas countries that are seen as more secular are less skeptical {{about the impact of}} science and technology. Though the United States is a highly religious country compared to other advanced industrial countries, according to the National Science Foundation, public attitudes towards science are more favorable in the United States than Europe, Russia, and Japan. A study on a national sample of US college students examined whether they viewed the science / religion relationship as reflecting primarily conflict, collaboration, or independence. The study concluded that the majority of undergraduates in both the natural and social sciences do not see conflict between science and religion. Another finding in the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it is more likely for students to move away from a conflict perspective to an independence or collaboration perspective than vice versa.|$|E
2500|$|The Greek Ministry of Finance has now {{installed}} a green roof on the Treasury in Constitution Square in Athens. [...] The so-called [...] "oikostegi" [...] (Greek – oiko, pronounced eeko, meaning building-ecological, and stegi, pronounced staygee, meaning roof-abode-shelter) was inaugurated in September, 2008. [...] Studies of the thermodynamics {{of the roof}} in September 2008 concluded that the thermal performance of the building was significantly affected by the installation. [...] In further studies, in August 2009, energy savings of 50% were observed for air conditioning in the floor directly below the installation. [...] The ten-floor building has a total floor space of 1.4 hectares. [...] The oikostegi covers 650m2, equalling 52% of the roof space and 8% of the total floor space. [...] Despite this, energy savings totalling €5,630 per annum were recorded, which translates to a 9% saving in air conditioning and a 4% saving in heating bills for the whole building. [...] An additional observation and conclusion of the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the thermodynamic performance of the oikostegi had improved as biomass was added over the 12 months {{between the first and}} second study. [...] This suggests that further improvements will be observed as the biomass increases still further. [...] The study also stated that while measurements were being made by thermal cameras, a plethora of beneficial insects were observed on the roof, such as butterflies, honey bees and ladybirds. [...] Obviously this was not the case before installation. [...] Finally, the study suggested that both the micro-climate and biodiversity of Constitution Square, in Athens, Greece had been improved by the oikostegi.|$|E
