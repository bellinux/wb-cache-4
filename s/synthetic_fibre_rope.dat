The advantages of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>rope</b> mooring systems include: • A higher floater payload and reduction in structural costs due to lower vertical load from mooring lines. • A reduction in vessel offsets and associated riser loads due to taut mooring system. • A potential reduction in installation costs due to lighter installation and handling equipment. • Superior endurance under cyclic loading compared to steel moorings...|$|E
40|$|From {{a marine}} {{operational}} point of view, a precise position and motion control of ships and other floating structures are important. In order {{to design a}} mooring system that can satisfy this, the top end motion of the mooring lines must be calculated. The excitation loads on a moored vessel are due to wind, waves and current. The wind is characterized as a static force excited by the mean wind speed, and as a low-frequency force excited by wind gusts. The waves are characterized by static mean forces, first order linear forces and second order non-linear wave forces. The current forces are considered as static forces. The main categories of station keeping are pure mooring systems, such as spread and single-point moorings, dynamic positioning systems and thruster-assisted mooring systems. Typical arrangements are taut, semi-taut and catenary systems. Mooring lines {{can be divided into}} several segments, with different material and buoyancy elements along the line. Mooring lines are often made of chain, <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>rope,</b> wire rope or a combination of them. Three limit states are described; intact (ULS), accidental (ALS) and fatigue (FLS). Generally there are three different methods to compute the response of a floating structure; the frequency domain, time domain or a combined time and frequency domain approach. In the frequency domain, the non-linear restoring terms and damping terms are linearised and the low- and wave-frequency load effects are decoupled. The total contribution is then found by use of the superposition principle. In the time domain, the motions are solved simultaneously and non-linear effects are directly accounted for in the restoring and damping terms. The FPSO in question is located in the Barents Sea on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The ship-shaped unit has a passive turret mooring system consisting of three bundles with five anchor lines each, resulting in 15 mooring lines. The vessel has in total 11 risers, with opportunity for future risers. A coupled SIMO-RIFLEX model provided by Statoil has been used to perform simple ULS and ALS analyses in the software SIMO, by use of the time domain approach. In this thesis three following limitations are considered valid; three environmental conditions are tested, the risers are disabled and the number of required simulations are found to be 14. In addition, the turret model is simplified to a beam element with zero torsional stiffness. Two important functional requirements for the FPSO are that the integrity of the risers are maintained, provided by an offset requirement, and that the safety factor for the moorings are fulfilled. Several analyses for the intact condition are performed for different 100 -years conditions for the loaded vessel. Four additional ALS analyses are conducted for the case with the most loaded line in ballast condition; one and two anchor line failure, and two definitions of the ALS extreme weather with 10 000 -year return period. The vessel offset, the mooring line tensions and the dynamic turret support forces for all cases are discussed and compared with the respective acceptance criteria. In addition, simple uplift calculations are derived for the intact condition and the condition most sensitive towards uplift. Ship-shaped units are sensitive to low-frequency motion, and therefore the sea state with the shortest period is the most critical one. The results show that the in-line condition leads to the highest tension in the mooring lines, hence this condition is further investigated for the accidental limit states. Both one and two line failures fulfils the requirements for permanent structures operating on the Norwegian Continental Shelf provided by DNV GL. Statoil has an internal requirement for the extreme weather conditions, both extreme conditions fulfils the criteria. Comparing two definitions of the ALS extreme weather with 10 000 -year return period, for the waves and wind, the waves were found to be the most critical extreme condition giving the highest responses of the ship-shaped unit and mooring system. Units with large topsides, such as semi-submersibles, are often more sensitive towards extreme wind. The dimensioning parameter for the FPSO is the tension in the heaviest loaded line in the two anchor line failure analysis, with a margin of 0. 27...|$|E

40|$|Termination of {{heavy-duty}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>ropes</b> {{has long}} been an issue of concern in marine environments. Recent serious rope accidents and new requirements for lighter ropes with better performance in mooring lines have encouraged industry to look for new methods for increasing line performance using existing ropes. One way of increasing rope performance is to use efficient methods for rope termination. This is why the main objective of this study has been to investigate a new method for rope termination. Rope failure usually happens inside or very close to termination due to high stress concentration areas. The new method, "The Vaseghi Stress Relief Socket", has been proposed to improve the high stress concentration areas inside sockets and move failure points along the rope.

40|$|PublishedOne {{immediate}} {{challenge for}} the Marine Energy Converters (MECs) industry is solving the cost and weight problems of mooring lines in deepwater (> 75 m). <b>Fibre</b> <b>rope</b> taut mooring lines represent a new and interesting option for the mooring of MECs in deepwater. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>ropes</b> offer {{a solution to the}} weight problems of using steel lines in deepwater as they have a very low weight in water. Also, compared to steel, there are a large number of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> material compositions {{with a wide range of}} material properties. A synthetic rope can therefore be designed to have properties that match the mooring requirements. Several materials have potential for mooring line application. Yarns of these synthetic materials can be made into ropes using a number of constructions, some of which are suited to particular fibres. As with any new application, research must be conducted to determine how well the <b>fibre</b> <b>ropes</b> satisfy the performance requirements.

50|$|Since the {{valuable}} fibres {{are located in}} the phloem, they must often be separated from the xylem material ("woody core"), and sometimes also from the epidermis. The process for this is called retting, and can be performed by micro-organisms either on land (nowadays the most important) or in water, or by chemicals (for instance high pH and chelating agents) or by pectinolytic enzymes. In the phloem, bast fibres occur in bundles that are glued together by pectin and calcium ions. More intense retting separates the fibre bundles into elementary fibres, that can be several centimetres long. Often bast fibres have higher tensile strength than other kinds, and are used in high-quality textiles (sometimes in blends with cotton or <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres),</b> <b>ropes,</b> yarn, paper, composite materials and burlap. An important property of bast fibres is that they contain a special structure, the fibre node, that represents a weak point, and gives flexibility. Seed hairs, such as cotton, do not have nodes.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>ropes</b> are in widespread use in maritime applications ranging from lifting to temporary and permanent mooring systems for vessels, offshore equipment and platforms. The selection of synthetic ropes over conventional steel components is motivated by several key advantages including selectable axial stiffness, energy absorption (and hence load mitigation), fatigue resistance and low unit cost. The long-term use of ropes as safety critical components in potentially high dynamic loading environments necessitates that new designs are verified using stringent qualification procedures. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is one certification body that has produced several guidelines for the testing of synthetic ropes encompassing quasi-static and dynamic loading as well as fatigue cycling. This paper {{presents the results of}} tension-tension tests carried out to ISO 2307 : 2010, ISO 18692 : 2007 (E) and ISO/TS 19336 : 2015 (E) on three different 12 -strand rope constructions manufactured by Ashimori Industry Co. Ltd from polyester and Vectran® fibres. The purpose of the tests was to characterise the performance of a novel 12 -strand construction and compare this to a conventional 12 -strand construction. Utilising the Dynamic Marine Component test facility (DMaC) at the University of Exeter several key performance metrics were determined including; elongation, minimum break load (MBL) and quasi-static and dynamic stiffness. During the ISO 2307 : 2010 (E) test programme the samples were tested dry and during the ISO 18692 : 2007 (E) and ISO/TS 19336 : 2015 (E) test programmes the samples were fully submerged in tap water after being soaked for at least 24 hours. Two methods were used to quantify sample extension: i) an optical tracking system and ii) a draw-wire potentiometer. Axial compression fatigue and cyclic loading endurance tests were also carried out on two Vectran® samples. Further load-to-failure tests and sample analysis were also carried out by Ashimori Industry Co. Ltd.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the process of damage and failure in small diameter high performance <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>ropes</b> namely Dyneema, Vectran and Technora ropes. This study was prompted by a series of fatal accidents on paragliders {{as a result of the}} line failure. All the different rope materials, including the rope with cover, without cover and the core with different number of strands, have been tensile tested. The transfer of loading and subsequent damage in different <b>rope</b> constituents, <b>fibres</b> and strands, are also discussed. The residual strength of the rope after static and cyclic preloading regimes is discussed and possible mechanisms for the damage accumulation in the rope are given. The acoustic emission monitoring of the tensile and residual strength tests shows distinctive differences between the different types of rope and permits the identification of characteristic effects of preloading on the tensile damage and failure mechanisms of all three materials. The process of damage in the Dyneema and Vectran is similar, in which damage progresses in steps during the loading history whereas Technora rope accumulates gradual increase in damage until the catastrophic failure. The application of the static preloading improves the strength of Dyneema and Vectran ropes whereas it deteriorates the mechanical properties of Technora rope. The cyclic response of Dyneema rope shows a dramatic downturn at lives in excess of 1000 cycles, but moderate cyclic loading improves the strength. The variation in surface temperature of Dyneema rope during tensile loading has been measured analysed and related to the process of damage. Dyneema fibres melt and fuse together under loading, since Dyneema is disadvantaged by its low melting temperature. Rope on rope abrasion tests, carried out on covered and uncovered Dyneema and Technora ropes, show that Dyneema rope has superior abrasion properties compared to Technora. This is due to the low compression properties of Technora, as abrasion process involves compressing the fibres. The effect of exposure to different environments, including natural weathering, - 22 'C, + 54 'C and seawater on tensile performance is discussed. The tensile properties of the Dyneema ropes are little affected by the environmental conditioning except the effect of synthetic sea water, in which case the salt crystals damage the <b>rope</b> <b>fibres,</b> once the water has evaporated. ...|$|R
