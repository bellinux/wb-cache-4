25|$|Nine bomb explosions {{eventually}} {{occurred on}} the flight deck, eight caused by the AN-M65 Composition B bombs cooking off under {{the heat of the}} fuel fires, and the ninth occurring as a <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> between an AN-M65 and a newer 500lb M117 H6 bomb that it was lying next to on the deck. The other Composition H6-based bombs performed as designed and either burned on the deck or were jettisoned, but did not detonate under the heat of the fires.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> (SD, or SYDET), {{also called}} flash over, is a detonation, usually unintended, of an {{explosive}} charge by a nearby explosion. <b>Sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> {{is caused by}} a shock wave, or impact of primary or secondary blast fragments.|$|E
50|$|Special {{insensitive}} explosives, such as TATB, {{are used}} in e.g. military applications to prevent the <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonations.</b>|$|R
50|$|The shock sensitivity, {{also called}} gap sensitivity, which {{influences}} the susceptibility to <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonations,</b> {{can be measured}} by gap tests.|$|R
50|$|To prevent <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonations,</b> minimal {{distances}} (specific {{for a given}} type of the mine) have to {{be maintained}} between mines when laying a minefield.|$|R
50|$|Class 1.1 {{solid rocket}} fuels are {{susceptible}} to <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation.</b> Conversely, class 1.3 fuels can be ignited by a nearby fire or explosion, but are generally not susceptible to <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation.</b> Class 1.1 fuels, however, tend to have slightly higher specific impulses, and therefore are used in those military applications where weight and/or size is at a premium, e.g. on ballistic and cruise missile submarines.|$|E
50|$|The mines were {{normally}} laid between 3.5 and 1.8 meters apart, {{any closer}} would trigger <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> can be {{used for}} the {{destruction}} of unexploded ordnance, improvised explosive devices, land mines, or naval mines by an adjacent bulk charge.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sympathetic</b> <b>detonations</b> {{may occur}} in munitions stored in e.g. vehicles, ships, gun mounts, or storage depots, by a {{sufficiently}} close explosion of a projectile or a bomb. Such detonations {{after receiving a}} hit caused many catastrophic losses.|$|R
50|$|As {{it was a}} Sunday, {{no women}} were at work. There were 115 deaths of men and boys, {{including}} all the Works Fire Brigade, in the explosion and in subsequent <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonations.</b> The bodies of seven victims were never found; 108 corpses were buried in a mass grave at Faversham Cemetery on 6 April.|$|R
50|$|This {{is perhaps}} the most common, and {{certainly}} most mature demilitarisation destruction technology available. The rotary kiln is an unlined rotary furnace originally designed to destroy small arms and bulk explosives. The kiln is made up of four 1.6 metre long, 1 metre outer diameter retort sections bolted together. The 6 to 8 cm thick walls of the kiln are designed to withstand small detonations. The kiln contains internal spiral flights, which move the waste in an auger-like fashion through the retort as the kiln rotates. The flights also provide charge separation for the in-process materials, and discourage <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonations</b> and scattering of materials. The kiln is equipped with a variable speed drive, which allows varying rotation speeds and material residence time.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> during mine {{blasting}} {{may influence}} the seismic signature of the blast, by boosting the P-wave amplitude without significantly amplifying the surface wave.|$|E
50|$|Once fallen {{the charge}} is detonated, {{clearing}} a six-metre-wide path through anti-personnel or anti-tank mines over a distance of around 200 metres, by <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation.</b>|$|E
50|$|A cooked-off round {{may cause}} a <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> of {{adjacent}} rounds. Insensitive munitions {{are designed to}} be less vulnerable to accidental firing induced by external heat.|$|E
5000|$|... 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment (TF Rosser) {{maintained}} {{responsibility for}} the central and eastern portions of Panjwa’i District, approximately 35 kilometers west of Kandahar City. TF Rosser operated out of Forward Operating Base Shoja, and Combat Outposts Sperwan Ghar and Khenjakak. TF Rosser employed two separate security force assistance teams. 6th Kandak, 1st Brigade, 205th Afghan Army SFAT and the District Headquarters-Panjwa’i SFAT provided direct mentorship and assistance to the Afghan National Security Forces in Panjwa’i. Both SFATs worked at the kandak level in a location in southern Afghanistan. TF Rosser and its partnered 6th Kandak conducted a three-week-long combined arms breach, known as Operation Winter Road. The joint Afghan and US task force completed the construction of 6.3 kilometers of road {{through the heart of}} Panjwa’i. Seven mine clearing line charges were used to create greater than fifteen <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonations.</b> Thirty-five trees were removed to provide observation and fields of fire, with over 12,500 lbs of C4 explosive used. Forty-two pressure plate IEDs and one Hybrid RC-IED were reduced from sixteen different locations. TF Rosser exploited six caches consisting of five anti-personnel mines, two grenades, eight RPG rounds, forty-one high metal and thirty-eight carbon rod pressure plate systems, 250 rounds of AK-47 munitions and five AK-47 mags, 600 ft of lamp and detonation cord, ninety-one blasting caps, five radios, one cell phone, and over 350 lbs of HME, as well as hundreds of other IED making materials were removed from the area. During its deployment, the District Headquarters-Panjwa’i SFAT successfully transferred Panjwa’i’s District Headquarters to the Afghan Uniformed Police, and the 6th Kandak SFAT at Shoja assisted in hand-over of COPs Khenjakak and Sperwan Ghar to the Afghan National Army.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> killed 320 {{sailors and}} injured 390 {{others in the}} Port Chicago Disaster of July 17, 1944 at the Port Chicago Naval Magazine in Port Chicago, California.|$|E
50|$|The mine is {{waterproof}} {{and can be}} laid {{in water}} up to 1.2 meters deep. It is shock-resistant and can be laid as close as two meters apart without causing <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{related term}} is cooking off, setting off an {{explosive}} by subjecting it to sustained heat of e.g. a fire or a hot gun barrel. A cooked-off explosive may cause <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> of adjacent explosives.|$|E
50|$|During the 1967 USS Forrestal fire, eight old Composition B based iron bombs cooked off. The {{last one}} caused a <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> of a ninth bomb, {{a more modern}} and less cookoff-susceptible Composition H6 based one.|$|E
5000|$|The Topfmine C (To.Mi.C4531 or Pappmine) {{changed the}} design to an eight-sided {{flattened}} cylinder shape, {{with a central}} glass fuze plug on the top. This design was very thin-walled and <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> could occur if the mines were planted closer together than seven feet (2 m).|$|E
50|$|Spallation of {{materials}} after {{an impact on}} the opposite side may create fragments capable of causing sympathetic detonations of stored explosives {{on the opposite side of}} an armour plate or a concrete wall. Transfer of the shock wave through the wall or armour may also be possible cause of a <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Typically {{a catastrophic}} kill {{results in the}} {{ignition}} of any fuel the vehicle may be carrying {{as well as the}} detonation (cooking off, or <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation)</b> of its ammunition. A catastrophic kill does not necessarily preclude the survival of the vehicle's crew, although most historical casualties in armored warfare were the result of K-kills.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} armament, it is {{noteworthy}} that Niitaka was not equipped with torpedoes. Observing problems experienced by the United States Navy during the Spanish American War with torpedo reliability and the dangers of <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation,</b> it was decided not to use this weapon on the new cruisers. The main battery used the standard 15.2 cm/40 naval gun found on most contemporary Japanese cruisers.|$|E
50|$|Both {{versions}} of the mine are waterproof when new, and can be laid in shallow water, but the mine casing often splits and warps in hot climates, although small splits do not affect the mine's performance. The mines are prone to <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> if laid closer together than 2 m. The mine is found in Angola, Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, the Western Sahara, and Zambia.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} armament, it is {{noteworthy}} that the Niitaka-class cruisers were not equipped with torpedoes. Observing problems experienced by the United States Navy during the Spanish American War with torpedo reliability and the dangers of <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation,</b> it was decided not to use this weapon on the new cruisers. The main battery was standardized to the QF 6 inch /40 naval gun used on most contemporary Japanese cruisers.|$|E
50|$|If {{detonators}} {{with primary}} explosives are used, the shock {{wave of the}} initiating blast may set off the detonator and the attached charge. However even relatively insensitive explosives can be set off if their shock sensitivity is sufficient. Depending on the location, the shock wave can be transported by air, ground, or water. The process is probabilistic, a radius with 50% probability of <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> often being used for quantifying the distances involved.|$|E
50|$|Nine bomb explosions {{eventually}} {{occurred on}} the flight deck, eight caused by the AN-M65 Composition B bombs cooking off under {{the heat of the}} fuel fires, and the ninth occurring as a <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> between an AN-M65 and a newer 500 lb M117 H6 bomb that it was lying next to on the deck. The other Composition H6-based bombs performed as designed and either burned on the deck or were jettisoned, but did not detonate under the heat of the fires.|$|E
5000|$|Impact tests {{done by the}} US {{military}} indicate composition C-4 is {{less sensitive}} than composition C-3 and is fairly insensitive. The insensitivity is attributed to using {{a large amount of}} binder in its composition. A series of shots were fired at vials containing C-4 in a test referred to as [...] "the rifle bullet test". Only 20 percent of the vials burned, and none exploded. While C-4 passed the Army's bullet impact and fragment impact tests at ambient temperature, it did in fact fail the shock stimulus, <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> and shaped charge jet tests.|$|E
50|$|If an {{anti-tank}} projectile or shaped-charge blast {{manages to}} penetrate a turreted armored vehicle's hull and subsequently its ammunition storage area, the shock wave or heat and pressure can {{be sufficient to}} cause cooking off or <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> of the tank's entire load of unfired explosive shells and propellant. This causes a massive and instantaneous overpressure in the sealed internal compartment of the tank, until it explodes outwards through the weakest point in the otherwise homogeneous compartment, namely the turret ring, blowing the turret completely off the chassis and into the air in a gout of flame.|$|E
50|$|Hedgehog entered {{service in}} 1942. Carrying a Torpex charge {{weighing}} 16 kg, each mortar had {{a diameter of}} 18 cm and weighed about 29.5 kg. The projectiles were angled so they would land in a circular shape with a diameter of 40 m about 180 m ahead of a stationary ship. The projectiles would then sink at about 7 m/s. They would reach a submerged U-boat, for example at 200 ft in under 9 seconds. <b>Sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> of projectiles near those contacting hard surfaces was a possibility, {{but the number of}} explosions counted was usually fewer than the number of projectiles launched.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> {{presents}} {{problems in}} {{storage and transport}} of explosives and ordnance. Sufficient spacing between adjacent stacks of explosive materials has to be maintained. In case of an accidental detonation of one charge, other ones in the same container or dump can be detonated as well, but the explosion should not spread to other storage units. Special containers attenuating the shock wave {{can be used to}} prevent the sympathetic detonations; epoxy-bonded pumice liners were successfully tested. Blow-off panels may be used in structures, e.g. tank ammunition compartments, to channel the explosion overpressure in a desired direction to prevent a catastrophic failure.|$|E
50|$|In rock blasting, {{sympathetic}} detonations {{occur when}} the blastholes are sufficiently close to each other, usually 24in or less, and especially in rocks that poorly attenuate the shock energy. Ground water in open channels facilitates <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> as well. Blasthole spacing of 36in or more is suggested. However, in some ditch blasting cases sympathetic detonations are exploited purposefully. Nitroglycerine-based explosives are especially susceptible. Picric acid is sensitive as well. Water gel explosives, slurry explosives, and emulsion explosives tend to be insensitive to sympathetic detonations. For most industrial explosives, the maximum distances for possible sympathetic detonations are between 2-8 times of the charge diameter. Uncontrolled sympathetic detonations may cause excessive ground vibrations and/or flying rocks.|$|E
5000|$|Beyond {{the three}} {{approaches}} above, other threats need addressing when designing IM, e.g., slow and fast cook-off, <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation,</b> bullet and fragment impact, and shaped charge jet impact. Extensive testing requirements for potential IM candidates {{to address these}} threats are extremely costly. Modeling programs are being designed to simulate the threat of bullet and fragment impact {{in an effort to}} reduce testing costs. One of the most promising methods that engineers and scientists within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) are employing to help to enhance IM performance is by using advanced multiphysics modeling programs. [...] Also, another effort is underway developing 2-D numerical code that will simulate the threat of slow and fast cook-off.|$|E
50|$|While {{on station}} in the Aegean Sea {{under the guise of}} a hydrographic survey mission, the crew of Royal Navy {{electronic}} intelligence vessel HMS Ariadne witnesses two disasters at once, a mysterious strategic bomber crashing into the sea and a large pleasure yacht on fire and sinking. The plane turns out to have been loaded with nuclear weapons, and the survivors rescued from the yacht (who include a wealthy Greek tycoon) appear somehow connected with the plane's destruction. With potential saboteurs aboard, Commander Talbot and the crew of the Ariadne must raise the one activated weapon before it can explode, setting off the others by <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> and causing the nearby volcano of Santorini to explode in a tremendous eruption which would bring on a devastating tsunami and possibly a worldwide nuclear winter.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 February 1991, during Operation Desert Storm, Princeton was patrolling 28 nmi km off Failaka Island in the Persian Gulf, {{on the west side}} of the decoy United States Marine Corps and naval {{invasion}} forces afloat. At exactly 7:15 AM local time two Italian-made MN103 Manta bottom-mounted influence mines detonated, one just under the port rudder and the other just forward of the starboard bow, the second explosion most likely being a <b>sympathetic</b> <b>detonation</b> caused by the first. The blasts cracked the superstructure, buckled three lines in the hull, jammed the port rudder, flooded the #3 switchboard room through chilled water pipe cracks, and damaged the starboard propeller shaft. Three crewmembers were injured, one seriously. Despite the severe damage, the forward weapons and the AEGIS combat system were back online within 15 minutes.|$|E
