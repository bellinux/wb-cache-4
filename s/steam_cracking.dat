25|$|The chief use of ethane is the {{production}} of ethene (ethylene) by <b>steam</b> <b>cracking.</b> When diluted with steam and briefly heated to very high temperatures (900nbsp&°C or more), heavy hydrocarbons break down into lighter hydrocarbons, and saturated hydrocarbons become unsaturated. Ethane is favored for ethene production because the <b>steam</b> <b>cracking</b> of ethane is fairly selective for ethene, while the <b>steam</b> <b>cracking</b> of heavier hydrocarbons yields a product mixture poorer in ethene and richer in heavier alkenes (olefins), such as propene (propylene) and butadiene, and in aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>cracking</b> is {{the process}} for {{producing}} ethylene and other alkenes from aliphatic hydrocarbons.

40|$|The work {{presented}} here describes an experimental {{investigation into the}} choked flow of initially subcooled water through simulated <b>steam</b> generator tube <b>cracks</b> at pressures up to 6. 9 MPa. The study of such flow is relevant {{to the prediction of}} leak flow rates from a nuclear reactor primary side to secondary side through <b>cracks</b> in <b>steam</b> generator tubes. An experimental approach to measuring such flow is de- scribed. Experimental results from data found in literature as well as the data collected in this work are compared with predictions from presented models as well as predictions from the thermal-hydraulic system code RELAP 5. It is found that the homogeneous equilibrium model underpredicts choked flow rates of subcooled water through slits and artificial <b>steam</b> generator tube <b>cracks.</b> Additional modeling of thermal non-equilibrium improves the predictibility of choking mass flux for homogeneous models, however they fail to account for the characteristics of the two-phase pressure drop. An integral modeling approach is enhanced using a correlation developed from the data herein. Also, an assessment of the thermal-hydraulics code RELAP 5 is performed and it’s applicability to predict choking flow rates through <b>steam</b> generator tube <b>cracks</b> is addressed. This assessment determined that the Henry 2 ̆ 6 Fauske model, as coded in RELAP 5, is best suited for modeling choked flow through <b>steam</b> generator tube <b>cracks.</b> Finally, an approach to applying choked flow data that is not at the same thermo-dynamic conditions as a prototype is developed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Steam {{generator}} in {{a nuclear}} power plant is huge heat exchanger that transfers heat from reactor to make steam to drive turbine-generator. Failure of the steam generator tubes can result in the release of fission products to the secondary side. Therefore, accurate integrity assessment of the <b>cracked</b> <b>steam</b> generator tubes is of great importance for maintaining the safety of the nuclear power plant. This paper provides limit loads for circumferential through-wall <b>cracks</b> in <b>steam</b> generator tubes under combined internal pressure and bending loads. Such limit loads are developed on the basis of three dimensional finite element analyses assuming elastic-perfectly plastic material behavior. As for the crack location, both the top of the tubesheet and U-bend regions are considered. The analysis results can be directly applied to the practical integrity assessment of <b>cracked</b> <b>steam</b> generator tubes, because the comparison between experimental data and FE results shows a very good agreement...|$|R

25|$|In the United States, western Europe, and Japan, {{butadiene}} {{is produced}} as {{a byproduct of}} the <b>steam</b> <b>cracking</b> process used to produce ethylene and other olefins. When mixed with steam and briefly heated to very high temperatures (often over 900°C), aliphatic hydrocarbons give up hydrogen to produce a complex mixture of unsaturated hydrocarbons, including butadiene. The quantity of butadiene produced depends on the hydrocarbons used as feed. Light feeds, such as ethane, give primarily ethylene when cracked, but heavier feeds favor the formation of heavier olefins, butadiene, and aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>cracking</b> is a {{petrochemical}} {{process in}} which saturated hydrocarbons are broken down into smaller, often unsaturated, hydrocarbons. It is the principal industrial method for producing the lighter alkenes (or commonly olefins), including ethene (or ethylene) and propene (or propylene). Steam cracker units are facilities in which a feedstock such as naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethane, propane or butane is thermally cracked {{through the use of}} steam in a bank of pyrolysis furnaces to produce lighter hydrocarbons. The products obtained depend on the composition of the feed, the hydrocarbon-to-steam ratio, and on the cracking temperature and furnace residence time.|$|E
25|$|In <b>steam</b> <b>cracking,</b> a gaseous or liquid {{hydrocarbon}} feed like naphtha, LPG or ethane is diluted with steam and briefly heated in a furnace without {{the presence of}} oxygen. Typically, the reaction temperature is very high, at around 850°C, but the reaction is only allowed to take place very briefly. In modern cracking furnaces, the residence time is reduced to milliseconds to improve yield, resulting in gas velocities up to the speed of sound. After the cracking temperature has been reached, the gas is quickly quenched to stop the reaction in a transfer line heat exchanger or inside a quenching header using quench oil.|$|E

25|$|A higher {{cracking}} temperature (also {{referred to}} as severity) favors the production of ethene and benzene, whereas lower severity produces higher amounts of propene, C4-hydrocarbons and liquid products. The process also results in the slow deposition of coke, a form of carbon, on the reactor walls. This degrades {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, so reaction conditions are designed to minimize this. Nonetheless, a <b>steam</b> <b>cracking</b> furnace can usually only run for a few months at a time between de-cokings. Decokes require the furnace to be isolated from the process and then a flow of steam or a steam/air mixture is passed through the furnace coils. This converts the hard solid carbon layer to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Once this reaction is complete, the furnace can be returned to service.|$|E

3000|$|Classical {{viscosity}} {{breaking of}} vacuum distillate residue or bitumens requires temperatures well {{in excess of}} 400  °C and up to 500  °C. This involves direct heating with coils or in soak drums as the pressure has to stay low to encourage cracking. Another method used to heat heavy feeds is hot water. Low pressure <b>steam</b> aids thermal <b>cracking</b> to make the smallest chemical building blocks such as ethylene and propylene—although this requires even higher temperatures. By contrast, lower temperature steam mobilises heavy hydrocarbons in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) (in situ) as well as post-processing such as bituminous oil (“tar sands”). The viscosity is reduced as long as heat is applied enabling improved mobility. Simultaneously, the steam selectively removes (“strips”) lighter components from the crude, but no cracking takes place as the temperature is well below the 340  °C threshold. Once the heating conditions are removed (i.e. after the heating zone), cooling results in a viscosity increase again.|$|R
