40|$|<b>Small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> in <b>South</b> Africa {{has been}} {{characterized}} by {{a system in which}} individual fishers are at the mercy of supply-chain middlemen and have no control over the prices they receive for their diminishing catches. To improve their incomes, fishers expanded their efforts, putting increased pressure on the area's already overexploited marine resources, which include west coast rock lobster and line-caught fish species. Shortening the value chain so that fishers would have greater access to markets at better prices required harnessing new legislation granting commercial fishing rights and marine management responsibilities to small-scale fishers working in newly formed cooperatives. Implementing this novel approach designed to contribute to local socio-economic development and help alleviate poverty would require the support and participation of community fishers, NGOs, and businesses, as well as tourism, university, and government officials...|$|R

40|$|The {{effort to}} {{conserve}} fisheries resources {{and improve the}} welfare of <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> households is an important objective of Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRS) in Tanzania. The success of such strategies depends both on the variation {{and the level of}} efficiency within <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> households. This paper examines the technical efficiency of <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> households in Tanzania using data from two coastal villages (Mlingotini and Nyamanzi). A stochastic frontier (with technical inefficiency effects) model is specified and estimated. The estimated mean technical efficiency of <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> households is 52 %. Results show that the efficiency of individual fishing households is positively associated with fishing experience, size of farming land, distance to the fishing ground, and potential market integration and negatively related to non-farm employment and bigger household sizes. We find that future policies aiming at targeting conservation-development issues in fishing communities should be concerted to provide mechanisms, which improve the access of <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> households to less destructive fishing tools via provision of credits, and markets as well as the creation of new employment opportunities in other sectors.

The success of such strategies depends on both the diversity {{and the level of}} efficiency within <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> households. This paper examines the technical efficiency of Tanzanian <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> households, based on data from two coastal villages located near Bagamoyo and Zanzibar, using a stochastic frontier model with technical inefficiency.

40|$|Power Point presentation. <b>Small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> {{communities}} in <b>South</b> Africa were recognised {{for the first}} time in 1998, when the Marine Living Resources Act, aimed at redressing apartheid era inequalities, was enacted. Government's primary intervention has been to issue annual individual permits, wherein Government defined the technical parameters for the fishers to operate as subsistence or as small-scale commercial fishers, dependent on the resources they harvested. These top-down driven regulations were initially accepted by the un-empowered fishers who hoped for some financial gain from possessing a legal fishing licence. Gradually, however, resistance to the categorisation of fishers into different sectors has grown among fishing communities and associated non-governmental organisations. Fishers argue that the rights allocation criteria have excluded many from their traditional activities, and that they typically employ a range of livelihood strategies, depending on resource availability and market opportunities. Evidence is given, based on research in several coastal communities, of this apparent polarisation effect between fishing practices and regulations. Fisher protests and a court challenge forced Government to redraft its small scale fishing policies in a consultative manner, the challenge being to find the balance between an economically driven, commercial rights model and an appropriate poverty reduction strategy. Whether a long-term, people centred, developmental approach will emerge remains to be seen, but it is certain that the fishers will no longer be satisfied with anything less than a more collaborative management approach and meaningful local governance over their livelihoods, derived from the harvest of a basket of nearshore marine resources...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{tension between}} power and {{democracy}} {{is crucial for}} understanding the nature and Outcomes of marine and coastal fisheries governance processes. However, this thesis Argues that prominent contemporary approaches to fisheries theory tend to promote a neoliberal vision of 'politics without politics', in which {{emphasis is placed on}} inclusive, de-centred and collaborative interaction between multiple and divergent state and non-state actors. By doing so, this perspective is likely to predispose the observer to underestimate the primacy of power as a factor determining the engagement between multiple actors in fisheries governance processes. This thesis seeks to address this apparent oversight by exploring some of the crucial power dynamics that are understated or overlooked by contemporary approaches to fisheries governance theory. It presents an ethnographic study of power and micro-politics in public participation and community based representation among <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> communities on <b>South</b> Africa's Cape Peninsula. The study is filtered through the theoretical framework of Pierre Bourdieu and other critical scholars, so as to reveal the material and symbolic forms of power and strategic practices that manifested through processes of representation and participation. This thesis demonstrates that community-based representation and public participation can serve as mechanisms for dominant actors to exercise and increase their power, while undermining rather than supporting the democratic interests and efforts of small-scale fishers. Drawing on this research on the Cape Peninsula, and on the theorising of Bourdieu and other critical scholars, this thesis concludes by suggesting how power can be brought into the analysis and theorisation of fisheries governance. In particular, this thesis proposes a real politik perspective as a means to understand how structural and micro-political power dynamics constrain the possibilities for democratic small-scale fisher representation and participation in fisheries governance processes...|$|R

Generally, {{there is almost no}} dialogue between these professionals of the <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing,</b> the scientific community, the technical experts, as well as policy-makers related with the coastal areas management. This conjuncture compromises the implementation of integrated and sustainable management plans, for which this study should contribute. The approach was performed as an interdisciplinary exercise, essentially using qualitative methods; it was based on a dialogal methodology, the interview, semi-structured, directed to a panel of privileged informers. The <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> communities studied have different frameworks and are located in several NUTS II of the Portuguese territory. The Strategic SWOT Analysis was performed to the categories which emerged from the qualitative content analysis of the interviews. The study of the categories “Artisanal fishermen” and “Associativism” allowed their characterization and the establishment of Strategic Recommendations and Strategy Supporting the Political Decision-making related with integrated and sustainable coastal development. When included in feasibility studies, the artisanal fishermen's proposals can permit the implementation and execution of management plans, more efficient and connected to the reality; in the present case, an inclusive perspective to the littoral integrated and sustainable development...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} spatial {{patterns in}} <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> in Africa. It {{is located in}} Lake Victoria where since the 1990 s a vibrant Nile perch fishing for overseas export developed. Focusing on a very small area in the Ugandan part of the lake, the paper uncovers a larger diversity in fishermen's responses to the dynamic environment of the Nile perch sector than a widely adopted generic model predicts. To understand this better, the paper looks at the social practices of Nile perch fishermen, uncovering the operation of different, spatially situated, fishing styles. These styles structure the social relations that the fishermen mobilise, the symbolic meanings they attach to their gear, and the values that inspire their decision-making. By thus looking at socio-cultural factors the paper hopes to contribute to an emerging spatial perspective on <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> in Africa that begins {{with an interest in}} actual social practice...|$|R

40|$|Designating <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> cooperatives as key {{actors in}} rights-based {{fisheries}} management represents a viable strategy for reconciling biological conservation with social objectives. Cooperatives are democratically-controlled enterprises designed {{to pursue the}} common interests of their members. In <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> communities, cooperatives provide a way for fishers to pool resources and engage in collective action towards social objectives including obtaining higher prices for fishers, investing in infrastructure, providing loans to members, {{and a range of}} community benefits. However, many aspects of the contemporary political and economic context of small-scale fisheries present barriers to the success of fishing cooperatives, such as competition with private sector fish buyers and middlemen and fewer opportunities for government subsidies and loans. Providing fishing cooperatives with exclusive fishing rights can bolster the success of fishing cooperatives by generating a strong incentive for members to actively participate in cooperatives instead of work independently or for individual fish buyers. I present a case study of fishing cooperatives from Yucatán, Mexico that highlights multiple social benefits arising from cooperatives’ participation in rights-based fisheries management. In Yucatán, exclusive 20 -year fishing concessions for spiny lobster have underpinned the success of large, successful, and long-lasting fishing cooperatives. These cooperatives have, in turn, promoted important social and conservation outcomes in <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> communities. They serve as livelihood opportunities and social safety nets for fishing families and enhance the broader well-being of fishing communities. Furthermore, they have played an important role as stewards of fishery conservation for multiple species and encourage fishers’ active participation in management...|$|R
