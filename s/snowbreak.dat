60|$|And so, like <b>snowbreak</b> {{from the}} mountains, for every {{staircase}} is a melted brook, it storms; tumultuous, wild-shrilling, towards the Hotel-de-Ville. Tumultuous, {{with or without}} drum-music: for the Faubourg Saint-Antoine also has tucked up its gown; and, with besom-staves, fire-irons, and even rusty pistols (void of ammunition), is flowing on. Sound of it flies, with a velocity of sound, to the outmost Barriers. By seven o'clock, on this raw October morning, fifth of the month, the Townhall will see wonders. Nay, as chance would have it, a male party are already there; clustering tumultuously round some National Patrol, and a Baker who has been seized with short weights. They are there; and have even lowered the rope of the Lanterne. So that the official persons have to smuggle forth the short-weighing Baker by back doors, and even send 'to all the Districts' for more force.|$|E
50|$|The Gaja runnel cut the {{limestone}} face deep {{and created the}} breakthrough called ’Római fürdő’, which like the other breakthroughs around here is very spectacular and romantic. The runnel running through the canyon is the most spectacular {{at the time of}} <b>snowbreak</b> with the small riffles and falls.This beautiful place is a bit farer from the village, {{in the middle of the}} forest. A resting place belongs to the excursion place and you can fry bacon here. ’Római fürdő’ is a perfect destination of a family trip on a Sunday afternoon. You can get there easily on foot from Tés or Bakonynána.|$|E
50|$|Sports Committee’s history lies {{its roots}} back to “The Athletics Association” founded in 1896 at Robert College. This {{organisation}} {{was also the}} first student association to be established in Turkey. Sports Committee’s aim, as one of the main parts of social life in Bogazici University, is to create a sportive environment with our numerous organization. For the past 120 years, the Sports Committee has been arranging all the sports events in the university. Binding 800 sportsmen in 23 different branches of sports under its root, this association has also various organizations which are Bogazici University Sports Awards, <b>SnowBreak,</b> Field Day, Fall Games, Interfaculty Tournament, Water Sports Weekend and Sports Fest.|$|E

40|$|This {{group is}} most common {{at the higher}} {{elevations}} in the Central Granitic Core and Upper Limestone Plateau of the Black Hills. It occurs on gentle to steep slopes. Several mountain grasslands (many that are not associated with water) are intermingled throughout this area and influence burn patterns. Vegetation Description Ponderosa pine, white spruce, paper birch and aspen are dominant overstory species. Other woody species found in various areas of this type includes various woody species such as bearberry, hazelnut, ninebark, grouseberry, snowberry, rose, and ironwood. Spruce and paper birch generally occur on northern aspects and higher elevations of this area. Numerous forb species dominate the herbaceous layer and include species such as twinflower, violets, and orchids. Disturbance Description Fire Regime Group III or I. Stand replacing disturbances are primarily associated with climatic fluctuations and include fire and insect (in late-development classes only, mountain pine beetle creates larger patch sizes; Ips beetles creates smaller patches). <b>Snowbreak</b> and windthrow events may occur, but are not modeled here. Surface and stand replacing fire events occurred in this PNVG. Stand replacing fires were likely most common in higher elevation and northern slopes that were primarily dominated by spruce, with surface fires and occurring most often in the moist ponderosa pine. There is some debate about whether mixed severity fire would have occurred in this type based on tree-ring and historical evidence. It is included in this model at a 200 -year return interval, but see peer-review feedback under "Comments"...|$|E
40|$|To {{establish}} {{the most important}} Norway spruce Romanian populations, open-pollinated progeny of ten plus trees originating from 33 seed stands mapped in the Romanian Carpathians have been evaluated for stem and crown characteristics {{at the age of}} 30 years, in two field trials: one established in their natural range (Breţcu trial), while the second was located outside of their natural range, in Subcarpathian lands (Avrig trial). Significant (p < 0. 05) differences were found among the seed stands in both sites for most of the characteristics, suggesting an additive genetic control with different levels of significance depending on the evaluated trait and the testing site. Location analysis also revealed a highly significant population x locality interaction for all traits. The same populations behave differently to the change of the ecological conditions. In the Avrig trial higher values were recorded than in the Breţcu trial for the tree slenderness coefficient (19 %), crown slenderness coefficient (13. 6 %) and crown lateral area (9. 4 %). Although outside of their natural area, pruning height (m) increased 6. 4 %, however pruning height ratio (%) decreases by 1 %, compared to the test established in their natural range. The populations from the Eastern Carpathians stand out by showing sustained growth and superior wood quality, while the populations from the Western Romanian Carpathians have generally smaller differences between the mean values of analysed traits in both field trials. Qualitative characteristics that influence the stability of stands to windthrow and <b>snowbreak</b> showed low levels of correlations to ecological gradients of the originating location of tested seed stands...|$|E
40|$|In the Baikal Region, {{there is}} no phenological {{isolation}} between Siberian stone pine (P. sibirica Du Tour) and Siberian dwarf stone pine (P. pumila (Pall.) Regel) since the timing of their 'flowering' coincides. Morphologically intermediate individuals, supposedly natural hybrids,occur not very often. In the west half of Stanovoye upland area four regions were investigated: Barguzinskiy, Baikalskiy, Verchneangarskiy and the Severo-Myiskiy mountain ridges. Interspecific natural hybridization was found {{to take place in}} several overlapping regions of the species' ranges; however there are some differences in frequency of natural hybrid occurrence between regions as well as within each region. Great numbers of natural hybrids are found only in a specific habitat which occurs rarely and occupies a relatively small area. At the north-east coast of Lake Baikal the lakeside zone is occupied by Siberian stone pine forests with moderate participation of Siberian dwarf stone pine in the undergrowth. The natural hybrid are widespread everywhere. The ratio of fructiferous Siberian stone pine, Siberian dwarf stone pine and natural hybrid was found to be approximately 300 : 10 : 1. About 90 % of the examined natural hybrids took an intermediate position between the two parental species by most features (structure of needles, shoots, and crown), i. e. representing putatively the first generation hybrids. Therefore, in contrast to the parental species they are subjected to the destructive effect of <b>snowbreak</b> (broken off or dislocated from part of the root system). Like the Siberian dwarf stone pine the natural hybrid has specific root sources forming from latent buds. Therefore, the hybrids are not subjected to ageing, as well as have no internal limitation of age and size. Siberian dwarf stone pine, Siberian stone pine and their natural hybrid grow together in the Upper Angara delta in the bog regions. In the most productive sites the ratio of fructiferous Siberian dwarf stone pine, Siberian stone pine and natural hybrid amounts approximately to 60 : 3 : 1. The ratio of fructiferous Siberian dwarf stone pine and natural hybrid reaches about 20 : 1 in the less productive sites where Siberian stone pine is sterile. Analysis of cone structure showed that the natural hybrid have substantially increased in comparison with the species' mortality and aplasia of reproductive structures at all stages of the generative cycle, from differentiation of the seed-bearing scales to differentiation of the embryo. The portion of the ovules, which develop into the valuable seed with differentiated embryo, amounted in Siberian dwarf stone pine to 69 %, in Siberian stone pine to 44 %, and in natural hybrid to 25 %. Thus, the fertility of natural hybrid in the Upper Angara Delta substantially decreased in comparison with the pure species; however, it was demonstrated that natural hybridization between Siberian dwarf stone pine and Siberian stone pine species occurred. </span...|$|E
