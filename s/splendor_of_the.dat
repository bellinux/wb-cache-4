25|$|Haninai's posthumous son Bostanai was {{the first}} of the exilarchs under Arabic rule.

Through him, the <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> office was renewed and its political position made secure. His tomb in Pumbedita was a place of worship as late as the 12th century, according to Benjamin of Tudela.|$|E
25|$|This {{incident}} {{was a sign}} of Elizabeth's strong and distinctive personality. This difficult experience seems to have made her, {{for the first time in}} her young life, fully aware of the serious, even deadly, nature of her succession rights to the throne. When she made her first public appearance at court 18 months later, just turning 17, she dressed in a simple, somber manner with plain and unadorned hair. This contrasted sharply with the showy <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other ladies present, as if she was trying to live down the scandal of her association with Thomas.|$|E
25|$|Paul VI did {{away with}} much of the regal <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> papacy.

Paul VI donated his own Papal Tiara, a gift from his former Archdiocese of Milan, to the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, DC (where it is on permanent display in the Crypt) as a gift to American Catholics.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} the Emerald City is changed in the film. In the book, the city is not {{actually}} all green, but everyone is forced to wear green tinted spectacles (ostensibly to protect their eyes from the glory and <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> luxurious city), thus making everything appear green. In the film, the city is actually all green. The architecture of the Emerald City in the movie uses a much more contemporary Art Deco style than Baum could have imagined. In the book, a giant green wall studded in glittering emeralds surrounds the entire city, whereas in the movie {{there is only a}} gate opening.|$|E
25|$|In {{many places}} {{throughout}} the Hebrew Scriptures – particularly the Book of Hosea – Israel is figured as Yahweh's wife or bride. Malachi's discussion of divorce {{may also be}} understood to conform to this metaphor. Malachi {{could very well be}} urging his audience not to break faith with Yahweh (the God of Israel) by adopting new gods or idols. It is quite likely that, since the people of Judah were questioning Yahweh's love and justice (1:2, 2:17), they might be tempted to adopt foreign gods. William LaSor suggests that, because the restoration to the land of Judah had not resulted in anything like the prophesied <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> messianic age which had been prophesied, the people were becoming quite disillusioned with their religion.|$|E
25|$|In 640 BC, the Elamites were {{defeated}} by Ashurbanipal, coming {{under the rule}} of the Assyrians who brought destruction upon Susa and Chogha Zanbil. But in 538 BC, Cyrus the Great was able to re-conquer the Elamite lands after nearly 80 years of Median rule. The city of Susa was then proclaimed as one of the Achaemenid capitals. Darius the Great then erected a grand palace known as Apadana there in 521 BC. But this astonishing period of glory and <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Achaemenian dynasty came to an end by the conquests of Alexander of Macedon. The Susa weddings was arranged by Alexander in 324 BC in Susa, where mass weddings took place between the Persians and the Macedonians. After Alexander, the Seleucid dynasty came to rule the area.|$|E

Within the hitherto unadorned apse of the basilica, the Cathedra Petri, the symbolic throne of St Peter, was rearranged as a monumental gilded bronze extravagance that matched the Baldacchino created earlier in the century. Bernini's complete reconstruction of the Scala Regia, the stately papal stairway between St. Peters's and the Vatican Palace, was slightly less ostentatious in appearance but still taxed Bernini's creative powers (employing, for example, clever tricks of optical illusion) to create a seemingly uniform, totally functional, but nonetheless regally impressive stairway to connect two irregular buildings within an even more irregular space.|$|E
25|$|Penn {{returned}} {{home for the}} extraordinary <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King's restoration ceremony and was a guest of honor alongside his father, who received a highly unusual royal salute for his services to the Crown. Though undetermined at the time, the Admiral had great hopes for his son's career under the favour of the King. Back at Oxford, Penn considered a medical career and took some dissecting classes. Rational thought began to spread into science, politics and economics, which he took a liking to. When theologian John Owen was fired from his deanery, Penn and other open-minded students rallied to his side and attended seminars at the dean's house, where intellectual discussions covered the gamut of new thought. Penn learned the valuable skills of forming ideas into theory, discussing theory through reasoned debate, and testing the theories in the real world.|$|E

The full ceremonial <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall was reserved for special occasions, such as the banquets for Arab envoys, described in the De Ceremoniis: additional lightning was provided by great chandeliers, imperial regalia, relics and other precious items were brought from various churches and displayed in the apses, while the meal was accompanied by music from two silver and two golden organs, placed in the porch, {{as well as by the}} choirs of the Hagia Sophia and the Holy Apostles.|$|E

500|$|Light {{became a}} popular means for 15th-century Northern {{painters}} {{to represent the}} mystery of the Incarnation, utilising the idea of light passing through glass without shattering it to convey the paradox of conception and [...] "virgo intacta".

500|$|Light was {{associated}} with Mary and the Incarnation from the 9th century.

In February, <b>the</b> emir <b>of</b> Homs, Janah ad-Dawla, who had fought bravely at <b>the</b> siege <b>of</b> Antioch, offered horses to Raymond. <b>The</b> qadi <b>of</b> Tripoli, Jalal al-Mulk, from the Banu Ammar, sent rich gifts and invited the Franks to send an embassy to his city. The ambassadors marvelled at <b>the</b> <b>splendors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, and an alliance was concluded.

On the cusp of having sex with Angela, he returns to himself after she admits her virginity. Suddenly confronted with a child, he begins to treat her as a daughter; in doing so, Lester sees himself, Angela, and his family [...] "for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are". He looks at a picture of his family in happier times, and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with [...] "wonder, joy, and soul-shaking gratitude"—he has finally seen the world as it is.|$|E

These too, are similar to the events which are seen to have warriors and soldiers thrive; the rise and fall of prefectures, countries and other such events are what make uses for warriors, as well as the literal comparisons: [...] "The carpenter uses a master plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, and <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> strategy is similar in that there is a plan of campaign".|$|R
