This paper presents the application of simulation and statistical analysis for replacing a manual welding system of a body <b>shop</b> <b>assembly</b> with a robotic spot welding system (RSWS). Initially, the RSWS developed uses a minimum number of robots for producing the same number of output as before. Robot selection analysis was performed using Multi-Attribute Decision Making method. The CAD model was built using Solidworks software and simulation was performed using Robotworks software. The data that was acquired from robot workcell simulation were transferred to Witness software for purpose of shop floor simulation. The results from Witness simulation show that the new welding layout is capable of achieving the manufacturer’s target. The analysis shows results of lower operational cost and the break event point will be achieved by the third year of operation. The implementation of RSWS for automotive application is reasonable because of efficiency, accuracy and cost effective. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the transformation Mould and Die (MD) manufacturing industry from the traditional manufacturing paradigm into service-oriented manufacturing (SOM) in collaboration with leading manufacturers in the sector. It investigates how the new concept of Production Service System (PnSS) can be used and extended to integrate distributed manufacturing-oriented services (MOSs) so that all participants could efficiently and effectively collaborate in response to market opportunities. In the PnSS model, MD manufacturers become more specialized in providing certain types of MD products and components while outsourcing other components or related services as MOSs from MOS providers (MOSPs). The main objective of this {{research is}} to develop an information and collaboration platform for PnSS (iPnSS) to utilize MOSs and support the implementation of PnSS strategy for MD industry. The proposed iPnSS is developed based on the SOA (Service-oriented Architecture) paradigm, which aims to encapsulate MOSs as Software as a Service so that MOSs can be advertised, searched, and utilized by stakeholders in PnSS. Several core MOSs have been developed as the core components of iPnSS to meet the urgent requirements of participants in new business model, including Ontology-based Dynamic Alliance Service (ODAS) for forming PnSS alliance, Real-time Order Progress Kanban Service (RT-OPKS) for collaborative project tracking and coordinating, and Hybrid Flow <b>Shop</b> <b>Assembly</b> Scheduling Service (HFS-ASS) for production planning and scheduling which is specified for MD production. The research makes several key contributions. First, this research investigates the characteristics and challenges of MD industry, and develops the PnSS business model to transform the traditional manufacturing into service-oriented manufacturing for MD industry. An information and collaboration platform called iPnSS is developed to provide related IT solutions for integrating distributed MOSs to facilitate the practical usage of PnSS. Second, Ontology-based Dynamic Alliance Service is developed to enable participants to form alliance and take advantage of SOM. This service provides a systematic and integrated supplier selection approach in PnSS, being responsible for the major stages in the life cycle of a service-enabled manufacturing process, including service provision and consumption as well as service evaluation and organization respectively. Third, Real-time Order Progress Kanban Service with the support of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is developed to support the efficient knowledge feedback for shop floor visibility and traceability. This service provides a set of mechanisms to monitor, evaluate and coordinate the manufacturing execution during the process of collaborative manufacturing after the formation of alliance. Finally, Hybrid Flow <b>Shop</b> <b>Assembly</b> Scheduling Service is developed to deal with scheduling problem for manufacturing one-of-a-kind products, which is based on real-life study with MD industrial collaborators. For each order in MD manufacturing is assembled after the required components have been produced, the service firstly considers the production simultaneity of components of the same product for final assembly. The service automatically generates scheduling results for PnSS user. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|The {{definition}} of system metrics {{is crucial to}} determine if a manufacturing system design is truly effective because inappropriate metrics can lead to ineffective or improperly-focused system improvements. This research highlights the importance of measuring the system design that contributes to system effectiveness. The authors propose the use of a Manufacturing System Design Evaluation Tool to assess the effectiveness of the design of manufacturing systems as a whole. The tool was developed based on the Manufacturing System Design Decomposition. The Manufacturing System Design Evaluation Tool measures how well a system is designed based on the requirements outlined in the Manufacturing System Design Decomposition. System effectiveness is evaluated based on six physical manufacturing system configurations: the Departmental or Job Shop Layout, Departments Arranged by Product Flow (sometimes called a Flow <b>Shop),</b> <b>Assembly</b> or Transfer Line, Pseudo-Cell (a cell that is called a cell but does not meet all of the requirements of a cell), individual Assembly or Machining Cells (but not yet integrated as a system), and a Linked-Cell Manufacturing System for all aspects of a production value stream. The Linked-Cell Manufacturing System is considered to be the physical configuration that represents the highest level of manufacturing system design requirements achievement. In addition, the siginificance of implementing one physical element relative to achieving the requirements of the overall manufacturing system design may be evaluated. With this feedback, management is able to identify elements of the system design that need improvement and additional resources. The proposed Manufacturing System Design Evaluation Tool may be applied to evaluate most repetitive, discrete-part manufacturing systems...|$|E
40|$|The Instron Corporation in Canton, MA, {{manufactures}} {{material testing}} systems. These systems {{are used to}} evaluate the tensile strength of metals, plastics, composites, textiles, and other materials by holding a test sample at each end with a mechanical "grip," pulling in opposite directions, and measuring the applied forces. This thesis describes the efforts of a project improvement team chartered to dramatically reduce inventory for a variety of mechanical grips without increasing cycle time or component fabrication costs. The author developed optimization techniques, queuing theory models, and simulation tools to guide the improvement efforts. The project team achieved a thirty-percent reduction in grip inventory in six months by consolidating redundant supply chains, changing from a make-to-stock to a make-to-order process, and changing from material resource planning to pull production. The inventory reduction increased the inventory turns from less than two to over four turns per year. Strategic inventory placement models suggested the problem could be split into two separate approaches: (1) managing the capacity of the job shop to meet the increased demand from supply chain consolidation; and (2) developing a control system for component and raw material inventories. The analysis of the capacity of the grip assembly job shop uses optimization techniques to specify the assembly lot sizes for the various grips and queuing theory to estimate the reserve capacity required to maintain cycle times under probabilistic demand. Simulations of the job <b>shop</b> <b>assembly</b> process validate the analysis and resource management plan. The continuous review control system specifies reorder points and order quantities for the hundreds of detail components and raw materials. The team's efforts are expected to reduce inventory by a similar amount in the coming months as excessive stocks are consumed. Recommendations for further reductions include improved component outsourcing, disposition of slow-moving inventory, and optimization of safety stock levels. Implementation of these recommendations will lead to inventory reductions of similar magnitude. by Daniel H. Wheeler. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{application}} of robotic U-shaped line layouts {{is becoming more}} important for manufacturing companies. Compared to straight assembly line layouts, U-shaped assembly lines result in cost savings, easier material handling and higher production rates. The {{reason for this is}} that U-shaped lines improve visibility and skill sharing between operators, increase production quality, reduce work in process inventory and facilitate problem-solving of appearing production failures which is shown in several researches. Key companies such as Toyota and Boeing are using U-shaped assembly lines to benefit from the advantages of U-shaped line layouts. However, few breakdown strategies are designed especially for U-shaped lines even though machine breakdowns are common. Breakdowns reduce the throughput rate and product quality and therefore strategies are needed which can ensure the targeted throughput and product quality of companies during breakdowns. In this thesis a breakdown strategy IS designed for a robotic U-shaped line which uses versatile backup robots on backup stations to cover the failures of workstation robots. Versatile backup robots are only considered in one prior study for a straight line layout and, in that study, the backup robots demonstrated a better performance than other breakdown strategies used for straight lines. The concept of backup stations with versatile robots is adapted to the robotic U-shaped line layout to identify whether backup robots can be an efficient breakdown strategy for robotic U-shaped lines. This adaptation is the placement of the backup stations between the arms of the U-shaped line layout. An automotive body <b>shop</b> <b>assembly</b> line configuration is selected for the U-shaped line layout. Ten workstations are used in the line configuration. Four positions exist for the placement of backup stations. Each combination of workstations and placement positions have been analyzed to find the most efficient backup strategy for line configuration designed. The analysis starts with the one backup station, then considers two backup stations and finally three backup stations on the four possible placement options. The best option of the one, two and three backup stations are compared with four backup stations and the current breakdown strategies which are the usage of manual repair stations only and the workload reallocation of broken robots by working robots downstream the line. The criteria for the performance comparison are the cycle time and product quality which are generated for a 5 %, 10 % and 15 %-line breakdown. For the generation of the criteria, a genetic algorithm is used which is modified from a straight line layout to the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy and current breakdown strategies. The analyses of the best placement options for the one, two, three and four backup stations options identify that the three and four backup stations options have the best cycle time and product quality for breakdowns, because they cover each workstation without the use of manual repair stations. It is shown that the three backup stations option is the best choice for the designed automotive body <b>shop</b> <b>assembly</b> line configuration. The three backup stations option has the same cycle time and product quality as the four backup stations option, but it uses one less backup station. Furthermore, the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy using three backup stations has a much better performance than the current breakdown strategies. Its cycle time for breakdowns is half as much as the cycle time of the current breakdown strategies and the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy does not use manual repair stations that generate a high product quality consciously. Due to these facts, the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy is an efficient breakdown strategy for the robotic U-shaped line, because it ensures production with a smooth line flow, a continuously high product quality and the avoidance of work in process inventories for breakdowns. Nevertheless, the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy has three major disadvantages. The first disadvantage is that the backup robots have to be maintained after each operating period to ensure that they do not break down. The next disadvantage is the requirements of an intelligent conveyor system so that the backup station can be accessed without disrupting the material flow when a breakdown occurs. The last disadvantage is that the backup robots have to been equipped with several possibly costly tools, to cover the workstation robots. The final decision on which backup strategy to use is therefore conditional on the cost of equipment, but this study can easily be extended to include these factors when the data is available. ...|$|E
