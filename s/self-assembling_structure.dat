The dynamic self-assembly assembly {{results from a}} competition between self-propulsion of particles and an attractive interaction between the particles.

The impact strength increases with increase {{of the content of}} SEBSMB in the matrix and it could be enhanced by 200 % at 20 wt% addition of the modifier. DMA and TG results show that the modified resin exhibits similar thermal stability as compared with pure epoxy resin.

40|$|UnrestrictedUnlike {{many aspects}} of the body, human teeth do not have natural {{regenerative}} mechanisms. Instead, the multiple tissues and mechanical structures in teeth combine to create a structural gradient that successfully absorbs a lifetime of impact forces from routine mastication without irreversible damage. The integration of hard and soft tissue types is advantageous for distributing loads but the resulting interfaces are prone to fracture. The intermediate boundary known as the dentino-enamel junction (DEJ) is a natural strategy which avoids abrupt changes in mechanical properties. The DEJ is a <b>self-assembling</b> <b>structure</b> which combines two dissimilar materials, enamel, and dentin. This junction is critical to the longevity of tooth function and is recognized to fulfill multiple roles. This thesis reviews the current state of knowledge related to the DEJ and its surrounding structures that cooperate together to create a failure resistant structure...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{effects of}} cooling rates on self-assembling structures and mechanical and electrochemical properties of 12 -hydroxystearic acid (12 -HSA) in an ionic liquid (IL), 1 -allyl- 3 -butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide ([ABIm][TFSI]). The mixture of 12 -HSA with [ABIm][TFSI] had an upper critical solution temperature (UCST) above the sol-gel transition temperature, and the microstructure of the ionogel was significantly affected by cooling rates, {{where it was}} prepared. The twisted <b>self-assembling</b> <b>structure</b> was formed during a slow cooling process {{at a rate of}} 0. 4 °C/min, whereas spherical domains caused by the liquid-liquid phase separation and radiate fibrous structure were observed for the quenched gel. The real-time small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements for the ionogel during a slow cooling process at a rate of 0. 4 °C/min presented three different (001) peaks arising from long spacings of 46. 5, 42. 4, and 39. 7 [*]Å, which were also observed for SAXS curves of a neat 12 -HSA. These results suggest that three polymorphic forms of 12 -HSA are formed in the IL. The polymorphic form significantly affected the mechanical properties of the ionogel, whereas it did not affect the ionic conductivity. The ionic conductivity of the ionogel was close to that of a neat [ABIm][TFSI] irrespective of the polymorphic forms of 12 -HSA...|$|E
40|$|<b>Self-assembled</b> <b>structures</b> of poly(2 -isopropyl- 2 -oxazoline) (PiPOx) and poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) block {{copolymers}} {{in water}} were studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV-VIS spectroscopy (UV-VIS). The block copolymers were prepared by azide-alkyne cycloaddition between PiPOx and PLLA homopolymers. The homopolymers were prepared via ring-opening polymerization (ROP) techniques. The kinetics of the cationic ROP of PiPOx was investigated. The <b>self-assembled</b> <b>structures</b> were prepared via four different methods: nanoprecipitation, solvent exchange, dialysis, and thin film rehydration. <b>Self-assembled</b> <b>structures</b> prepared from solvent exchange and dialysis had larger hydrodynamic radii than particles prepared from nanoprecipitation, {{due to a}} slower change in solvent quality. According to the Rg/Rh values, spherical structures were formed after nanoprecipitation. When the particles were heated to 50 °C, a sphere-to-rod transition took place. <b>Self-assembled</b> <b>structures</b> prepared via solvent exchange exhibited thermo-responsiveness when the PiPOx block was long enough. Surprisingly, the small structures prepared via nanoprecipitation did not show any thermo-responsiveness. Vain tiivistelmä.

40|$|Nanoparticle {{self-assembly}} is {{a complex}} phenomenon, the control of which {{is complicated by the}} lack of appropriate tools and techniques for monitoring the phenomenon with adequate resolution in real-time. In this work, a label-free technique based on dark-field microscopy was developed to investigate the self-assembly of nanoparticles. A bio-nanoparticle with complex shape (T 4 bacteriophage) that self-assembles on glass substrates upon drying was developed. The fluid flow regime during the drying process, as well as the final <b>self-assembled</b> <b>structures,</b> were studied using dark-field microscopy, while phage diffusion was analysed by tracking of the phage nanoparticles in the bulk solutions. The concentrations of T 4 phage nanoparticles and salt ions were identified as the main parameters influencing the fluid flow, particle motion and, consequently, the resulting <b>self-assembled</b> <b>structure.</b> This work demonstrates the utility of enhanced dark-field microscopy as a label-free technique for the observation of drying-induced self-assembly of bacteriophage T 4.

40|$|PhDThis thesis {{describes}} {{investigations of}} several complex fluid effects., including hydrodynamic spinodal decomposition, viscous instability. and self-assembly of a cubic surfactant phase, by simulating {{them with a}} lattice Boltzmann computational model. The introduction describes {{what is meant by}} the term "complex fluid", and why such fluids are both important and difficult to understand. A key feature of complex fluids is that their behaviour spans length and time scales. The lattice Boltzmann method is presented as a modelling technique which sits at a "mesoscale" level intermediate between coarse-grained and fine-grained detail, and which is therefore ideal for modelling certain classes of complex fluids. The following chapters describe simulations which have been performed using this technique, in two and three dimensions. Chapter 2 presents an investigation into the separation of a mixture of two fluids. This process is found to involve several physical mechanisms at different stages. The simulated behaviour is found to be in good agreement with existing theory, and a curious effect, due to multiple competing mechanisms, is observed, in agreement with experiments and other simulations. Chapter 3 describes an improvement to lattice Boltzmann models of Hele-Shaw flow, along with simulations which quantitatively demonstrate improvements in both accuracy and numerical stability. The Saffman-Taylor hydrodynamic instability is demonstrated using this model. Chapter 4 contains the details and results of the TeraGyroid experiment, which involved extremely large-scale simulations to investigate the dynamical behaviour of a <b>self-assembling</b> <b>structure.</b> The first finite- size-effect- free dynamical simulations of such a system are presented. It is found that several different mechanisms are responsible for the assembly; the existence of chiral domains is demonstrated, along with an examination of domain growth during self-assembly.

50|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{common to}} nearly all self-assembled systems is their thermodynamic stability. For SA {{to take place}} without intervention of external forces, the process must lead to a lower Gibbs free energy, thus <b>self-assembled</b> <b>structures</b> are thermodynamically more stable than the single, unassembled components. A direct consequence is the general tendency of <b>self-assembled</b> <b>structures</b> to be relatively free of defects. An example is the formation of two-dimensional superlattices composed of an orderly arrangement of micrometre-sized polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) spheres, starting from a solution containing the microspheres, in which the solvent is allowed to evaporate slowly in suitable conditions. In this case, the driving force is capillary interaction, which originates from the deformation of {{the surface of a}} liquid caused by the presence of floating or submerged particles.|$|R

Simple changes in particle geometry yield dramatic changes in phase behavior, ranging from macroscopic fluid phase separation to molecular-scale self- assembly.
