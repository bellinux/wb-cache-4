Sloughing is normally used {{to get rid of a}} card that may otherwise take a trick the player does not wish to take. It can also be used to void other suits allowing play of trump cards in tricks where that suit is led.|$|E

50|$|In older {{versions}} of this game, only single and double tricks were allowed. Players were also able to <b>sluff</b> losing tiles face down (this is characteristic of some trumpless trick-taking games like Tien Gow and Ganjifa). The rules of Khorol and Tien Gow appeared to have evolved in tandem and the Mongol game may be a simplification of the Chinese domino game.|$|E

5000|$|Hate Stick - A weapon {{constructed}} {{to pass a}} cursory weapons inspection, possibly even [...] "legal" [...] by the rules, but utilizing various methods of inflicting more pain than a normal, safe, weapon. These weapons are used to increase {{the probability of a}} <b>sluffer</b> accepting hits. The legality of these weapons varies on a case by case basis. The use of these weapons as a tool of compliance is generally frowned upon, and instead players are encouraged to communicate with opponents to minimize confusion.|$|R
40|$|Because {{of limited}} direct observation, {{understanding}} of the interior conditions of the massive storage caverns constructed in Gulf Coast salt domes is realizable only through predictions of salt response. Determination {{of the potential for}} formation of salt spans, leading to eventual salt falls, is based on salt creep and fracture using the Multimechanism-Deformation Coupled Fracture (MCDF) model. This is a continuum model for creep, coupled to continuum damage evolution. The model has been successfully tested against underground results of damage around several test rooms at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Model simulations, here, evaluate observations made in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) storage caverns, namely, the accumulation of material on cavern floors and evidence of salt falls. A simulation of a smooth cavern wall indicates damage is maximum at the surface but diminishes monotonically into the salt, which suggests the source of salt accumulation is surface <b>sluffing.</b> If a protuberance occurs on the wall, fracture damage can form beneath the protuberance, which will eventually cause fracture, and lead to a salt fall...|$|R
50|$|In many games, the {{following}} players must follow suit if they can, i.e. they must play a card {{of the same}} suit if possible. A player who cannot follow suit may <b>sluff</b> a card, i.e. play a card of a different suit. A trick is won by the player who has played the highest-ranked card of the suit led, i.e. of the suit of the first card in the trick (unless the game uses a trump suit; see below).|$|E

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{determined}} the gas contents of 135 oil shale samples obtained from approximately 630 ft of core drilling. Drilling was done within a projected mining {{zone of the}} Cathedral <b>Sluffs</b> Mine, located in the Piceance Basin of western Colorado. Methane contents were determined by the modified direct method, which can measure the volumes of several gases released from or reacted with mine rock without destructive sample treatment. Over {{the duration of the}} test, nitrogen was largely unreactive, CO 2 increased slightly, oxygen decreased markedly, and methane increased more than the total increase of all contained gases. The gas volumes were normalized per unit sample mass and are given in cubic centimeters per gram. Common time irzdices for test duration of 3, 40, and 125 days were used to compare methane desorption among samples. The means of the sample populations for these indices were 0. 0316, 0. 114, and 0. 195 cm 3 /g, respectively. These quantities are lower than those reported in a Bureau emissions study at the Horse Draw Mine in the Piceance Basin. Oil shale samples that were gas enriched beyond the mean methane contents frequently contained bitumens and pyrite...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Acidithiobacillus caldus is a {{thermophilic}} acidophile {{found in}} commercial biomining, acid mine drainage systems, and natural environments. Previous work has characterized A. caldus as a chemolithotrophic autotroph capable of utilizing reduced sulfur compounds under aerobic conditions. Organic acids are especially toxic to chemolithotrophs in low-pH environments, where they diffuse more readily {{into the cell}} and deprotonate within the cytoplasm. In the present study, the toxic effects of oxaloacetate, pyruvate, 2 -ketoglutarate, acetate, malate, succinate, and fumarate on A. caldus strain BC 13 were examined under batch conditions. All tested organic acids exhibited some inhibitory effect. Oxaloacetate was observed to inhibit growth completely at a concentration of 250 M, whereas other organic acids were completely inhibitory at concentrations of between 1, 000 and 5, 000 M. In these experiments, the measured concentrations of organic acids decreased with time, indicating uptake or assimilation by the cells. Phospholipid fatty acid analyses indicated an effect of organic acids on the cellular envelope. Notable differences included an increase in cyclic fatty acids {{in the presence of}} organic acids, indicating possible instability of the cellular envelope. This was supported by field emission scanning-electron micrographs showing blebbing and <b>sluffing</b> in cells grown in the presence of organic acids.

50|$|A ruff {{and discard}} (also known as ruff and slough or ruff and <b>sluff)</b> {{occurs when a}} player leads a suit that neither {{opponent}} has - typically in a suit contract, a defender leads a suit in which dummy and declarer are both void and dummy and declarer {{have at least one}} trump each. This gives declarer the option of discarding a losing card from one hand while playing a trump from the other, usually garnering an additional trick in the process. Thus, the ruff and discard is generally to be avoided by the defenders, except in rare cases where declarer has no side suit loser to discard. It is often inflicted upon the defence via an endplay.|$|E
50|$|North {{leads the}} deal with K♠. Now, all the other players must follow suit, i.e. play a spade card. East has a spade card, and thus must follow suit by playing 7♠. South, however, {{does not have any}} spade card, and thus is allowed to play any card he wants. If he desires to win the trick, he can {{override}} North's K♠ by playing a diamond card (diamond being the trump), for example J♦. If {{he does not want to}} win the trick, he can <b>sluff</b> any other suit, such as 3♥. Let us assume that he plays J♦, overriding North's card. Now, West still has to follow suit, since he has a spade card, and plays 2♠. South's trump card, gives him an opportunity to escape following suit, and he wins the trick.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{determine}} the incidence {{and types of}} intraoperative flap complications in laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) encountered with the Hansatome microkeratome and the Moria microkeratome. MethodsIn this retrospective case series, all patients with intraoperative flap complications who were treated between June 1999 and July 2008 at the Eye Consultants Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were identified and reviewed. ResultsOf the 4352 subjects who underwent bilateral primary LASIK procedure, intraoperative microkeratome complications were detected in 89 eyes of 83 patients. The overall incidence of flap complications was 89 / 8704 (1. 00 %) : incomplete flaps occurred in 53 eyes (0. 60 %), followed by buttonhole flaps in 17 eyes (0. 19 %), free complete flaps in 10 eyes (0. 11 %), free partial flaps in 6 eyes (0. 07 %), <b>sluffed</b> epithelium in 2 eyes (0. 023 %), and a splitted flap (vertical flap cut) in 1 eye (0. 01 %). The incidence rates of intraoperative flap complications with the Hansatome microkeratome and the Moria microkeratome were 1. 21 % (41 / 3378) and 0. 90 % (48 / 5326), respectively (P= 0. 19). There was {{a statistically significant difference}} between the two microkeratomes with regard to the incidence of buttonhole flaps: 0. 33 % (11 / 3378) for the Hansatome microkeratome versus 0. 11 % (6 / 5326) for the Moria microkeratome (P= 0. 04). ConclusionGenerally, the incidence rates of intraoperative flap complications with the Hansatome microkeratome and the Moria microkeratome were similar. However, buttonhole flaps occurred more often with the Hansatome microkeratome (a type of microkeratome that produces larger flaps). The commonest complication encountered was the incomplete flap, followed by the buttonhole flap and free flap...|$|R
5000|$|In {{most modern}} games with trump suits, {{the rules for}} {{following}} suit do not distinguish between the trump suit and the plain suits. If a trick begins with a plain suit card and a later player cannot follow suit, the player may choose freely to either <b>sluff</b> (discard a card of another plain suit), or ruff (trump the trick by playing a trump card). Subsequent players to the trick must still follow the original suit, and may only discard or trump {{if they do not}} hold a card of the suit led. Certain games are [...] "play to beat" [...] or [...] "must-trump"; if a player cannot follow suit but can play trump, they must play trump, and additionally if they are able they must beat any trump card already played to the trick. Pinochle and several of the Tarot card games have this rule.|$|E
50|$|The {{first person}} who was dealt leads. In a {{counter-clockwise}} rotation, each player then tries to take tricks; following suit is not required but only the highest card of the suit played wins. Players can also discard (<b>sluff)</b> their card face down if they can't or won't win the trick (this is similar to Tien Gow, Tam cúc, Six Tigers, Ganjifa, Kaiserspiel, and Brazilian Truco). Discarding face up is penalized with paying two stakes. Each player tries to win at least two tricks to avoid paying the banker. If the banker loses, then he'll {{have to pay the}} winners. Anyone who has not won one of the first seven tricks will automatically lose the last trick regardless of the strength of their final card. It is a strategy game requiring the cooperation of players against the banker. The Hundred Myriad is an important card to protect or capture as it figures in many bonuses.|$|E
5000|$|But {{consider}} {{what happens if}} you bid 2 Stayman rather than passing on the first round, and then pass opener's response. If opener rebids a major suit you have found a 4-4 fit and ability to trump club losers (or, alternately, to <b>sluff</b> the other major on club winners and then to trump losers in the other major). Likewise, a response of 2 guarantees no worse than a 5-2 fit in diamonds and, with a fifth trump, a potential additional ruff. The ability to reach dummy with a couple ruffs also may allow the declarer to take a couple finesses or execute a squeeze that otherwise would not be possible, and which might yield another trick or two. The result is a contract that will go down fewer tricks or that might even make, especially with a somewhat better hand than the example, rather than a contract that is virtually certain to go down at least three or four tricks. The practice of bidding Stayman with a relatively weak hand of this (or similar) shape and then passing the Notrump bidder's reply is often called [...] "Garbage Stayman" [...] because it is bidding Stayman with a [...] "garbage" [...] hand.|$|E
