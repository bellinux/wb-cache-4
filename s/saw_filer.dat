40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To study {{exposure}} to cobalt and chromium in saw maintenance rooms and test respiratory health among <b>saw</b> <b>filers</b> at lumber mills. Hard-metal lung disease {{is associated with}} cobalt {{in the manufacture of}} tungsten carbide tools; recently it has also been reported among tool maintenance workers. Lumber mills often use saws tipped with tungsten carbide or with a newer alloy, stellite (containing more cobalt, as well as chromium). METHODS [...] A cross sectional study of 118 <b>saw</b> <b>filers</b> at eight lumber mills was carried out that included a standardised questionnaire, spirometry, personal air sampling, and examination of tasks every 10 minutes (by observation). Comparison data were from a study of bus mechanics tested with similar methods. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION [...] Cobalt exposure was associated with tungsten carbide grinding but not with stellite grinding. Chromium exposure was associated mainly with stellite welding. <b>Saw</b> <b>filers</b> had a twofold increase in phlegm and wheeze (P < 0. 01) and a threefold increase in cough, phlegm, and wheeze related to work (P < 0. 001), but no increase in breathlessness. Stellite welding was associated with a significant increase in nasal symptoms and cough related to work and a small decrease in airflow (forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV 1 /FVC%), P < 0. 05). <b>Saw</b> <b>filers</b> wet grinding with tungsten carbide had significant reductions in forced expiratory lung volumes (FEV 1 and FVC, P < 0. 05) and {{were significantly more likely to}} have FEV 1 and FVC values in the abnormal range. Cobalt exposure (in wet grinding) and duration of work that involved tungsten carbide grinding were both associated with significant reductions in FEV 1 and FVC. Average cobalt exposures in this study were about 5 micrograms/m 3, well below the currently accepted permissible concentration, which suggests that the current workplace limit for cobalt may be too high...|$|R
25|$|After 1809, {{there have}} been no more wars between Russia and Sweden, partly due to Swedish {{neutrality}} and nonalignment foreign policy since then. Peaceful relationships and the Russian capital being Saint Petersburg, many Swedish companies ran large businesses in Imperial Russia, including Branobel and Ericsson. Many poets still grieved the loss of Finland and called for a military revenge, ideas that were refueled by the Crimean War in the 1850s. With the increasing cultural exchange between neighboring countries (Scandinavism) and the nationalist revival in Finland (through Johan Ludvig Runeberg and Elias Lönnrot), contempt with the attempts of Russification of Finland spread to Sweden. Before World War I, travelling Russian <b>saw</b> <b>filers</b> were suspected of espionage by Swedish proponents of increased military spending. After the Russian Revolution in the spring of 1917 and the abdication of the Tsar, great hope was vested in the new provisional government, only to be replaced with despair after the so-called October Revolution. Old anti-Russian sentiments were compounded by a fresh element of anti-communism, to last {{for the duration of the}} existence of the Soviet Union. Many Swedes voluntarily joined the Finnish side in the Winter War between Finland and Soviet Union 1939–1940. When the Soviet state was finally dissolved in 1991, anti-communism became less relevant in terms of power politics and for some time, few seemed to recall the fear of its predecessor. The old cry ryssen kommer also seemed obsolete.|$|R
5000|$|... "Sliver tooth" [...] saws have {{teeth on}} both sides but they have {{different}} profiles. The (usual) front side have teeth with a regular style tooth. The back of these saws have a longer style. The log is cut in a forward direction as with a single-cut but as the log returns, the saw de-burrs the cut (path where the saw passes) allowing for a cleaner finish. They are run for 4 to 24 hours then sent to the <b>saw</b> <b>filer</b> for maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Gumming {{involves}} grinding the gullets of the {{saw teeth}} {{to a particular}} shape. The <b>saw</b> <b>filer</b> uses a semi or fully automatic grinding machine for this. Saw bands operate under high stress and heat and {{in the presence of}} wood chips. Carbon migrates into the steel from the wood. Gumming prevents case hardening and fatigue cracking of the saw band gullets. Resaw Bandsaws (teeth on one side only) may be left or right-handed, depending on which way the teeth are pointing and which way the plank falls from the log when cutting. Double cut saws (teeth on both sides) are always gummed right hand teeth first.|$|E
5000|$|A precise {{profile of}} the tooth (including gullet area, hook angle and top {{clearance}} angle) must be maintained for proper saw operation and wood chip removal. Ease of cutting greatly depends on this. The shape {{is determined by the}} type of wood and cutting conditions. A <b>saw</b> <b>filer</b> will maintain the gullet shape by manually shaping the grinding wheel with a dressing stone, and the set up of his grinding machine. Variations include face angle, face length, back angle, gullet width and depth, and a frost notch (if necessary). Typical bandsaw tooth dimensions are 1-3/4" [...] tooth space x 3/4" [...] gullet depth x 3/4" [...] gullet width (grinding wheel width) x 30deg face angle x 16deg back angle.|$|E

He attempted to widen the distance between them, but in vain. A second glance showed him Mr. Walters close behind, with a face like that of two destroying angels rolled into one. Trembling with fright he quickened his pace and looked round eagerly for means of escape. His glance fell on a confectioner’s window, and muttering the word [...] "Ice" [...] he dashed in, followed in a more leisurely fashion by Miss Jelks.|$|R
50|$|Many studies {{argue that}} tax changes of S {{corporations}} confound the statistics prior to 1990. However, even after these changes inflation-adjusted average after-tax income grew by 25% between 1996 and 2006 (the {{last year for}} which individual income tax data is publicly available). This average increase, however, obscures a great deal of variation. The poorest 20% of tax filers experienced a 6% reduction in income while the top 0.1 percent of tax <b>filers</b> <b>saw</b> their income almost double. Tax filers in the middleof the income distribution experienced about a 10% increase in income. Also during this period, the proportion of income from capital increased for the top 0.1 percent from 64% to 70%.|$|R
