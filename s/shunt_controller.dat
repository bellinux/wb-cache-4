This is related to problems with load flow, power oscillations and voltage quality. Such problems are even deepened by the changing situations resulting from deregulation of the electrical power markets, where contractual power flows do no more follow the initial design criteria of the existing network configuration. Additional problems can arise in case of large system interconnections, especially when the connecting AC links are weak. FACTS devices, however, provide the necessary features to avoid technical problems in the power systems and they increase the transmission efficiency.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of an {{investigation}} to assess the potential of the continuation method to solve the minimum cost optimal power flow problem. For this purpose, a restart homotopy continuation method algorithm is developed, which contains in essence two phases. The pertinent steps of the first phase are as follows: (1) Create a sub-problem of the complete optimal power flow problem by relaxing boundary limits on all functional variables, namely voltages at load buses, line flows and reactive generations. (2) Parameterize a subset of the whole set of controls which comprises initially of tap-changers, phase-shifters, <b>shunt</b> <b>controllers,</b> and the voltages at generation buses. (3) Optimize the resulting problem. The solution in step (3) is used as an initial starting point in a continuation process, designed to track this solution to the optimal solution of the sub-problem defined in step (1). The tracking is accomplished via a predictor-corrector path following algorithm embodying certain special features, such that the solution accuracy can be improved to any desired degree through a flexible restart feature developed in this study. Within the tracking process only a subset (identified in step 2 above) of the whole set of controls require specific monitoring for break-points. This feature greatly reduces the computational burden. Termination of the first phase marks an operating point in which all controls are strictly feasible. If, following the termination of the first phase, functional variables previously ignored prove to be within their respective bounds, the solution to the sub-problem becomes the solution to the complete optimal power flow problem. However, should functional variables violate their bounds {{the second phase of the}} algorithm is invoked, which in essence creates a new sub-problem by changing the roles of the control and violated dependent variables, such that the newly modified sub-problem maintains the same basic structure as its predecessor. Phase I is invoked again at this juncture to solve the modified sub-problem. This process is repeated in cycles until the Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions are satisfied. Simulations suggest that convergence is usually achieved within two or three Phase I/II cycles. This being a method unique to the minimum cost optimal power flow problem, numerous examples (up to 118 buses) have been tested and compared against the commercial code MINOS. The newly proposed algorithm appears to be faster and more reliable...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, due to {{economics}} and environment problems, build of new power planet and transmission line become more difficult. Hence it is advisable to enhance power transfer {{capability of the}} existing transmission lines up to thermal limit instead of constructing new one. For enhancing the power capability, FACTS controller like SSC, TCSC, SVC are developed. But these controllers cannot compensate the real and reactive power separately. For this a controller called, Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) is developed which uses both the series and <b>shunt</b> <b>controller</b> with a common DC capacitor link. This capacitor brings several disadvantages such as affecting the reliability, high cost etc. This paper proposes a new topology for UPFC based on the Matrix converter design. Matrix converters (MCs) allow the direct ac/ac power conversion without dc energy storage links; therefore, the MC-based UPFC (MC-UPFC) has reduced volume and cost, reduced capacitor power losses, together with higher reliability. Theoretical principles of direct power control (DPC) based on sliding mode control techniques are established for an MC-UPFC dynamic model including the input filter. As a result, line active and reactive power, together with ac supply reactive power, can be directly controlled by selecting an appropriate matrix converter switching state guaranteeing good steady-state and dynamic responses...|$|E
30|$|According to the {{cascading}} failure model {{described in}} Section  3, the iterations between Stages 2 and 3 reflect {{the effect of}} the interdependence relations on the failures in CPPS. Thus, studying mitigation strategies for cascading failures is critical. The strategies proposed in this paper are to be implemented at both layers in the CPPS. In the cyber layer, making the nodes autonomous requires them to be equipped with backup power sources (UPS). This means that the bidirectional interdependencies with the corresponding physical nodes are transformed into unidirectional 3 C-function interdependencies. The FACTS technology can effectively improve the operational conditions for a steady and transient states of power systems, and the mitigation control strategies can effectively relieve the overloads, increase the power-transfer capability, and keep power flowing through the designated routers. Thus, FACTS are embedded in the physical layer, and can be classified into three types: shunt, series, and unified controllers. The <b>shunt</b> <b>controller</b> controls the voltage of the node within a certain range. The series and unified controllers control the active and reactive powers on the transmission line by adjusting the transmission line impedance and injected power of the node. Considering the versatility and multi-controlled variables, as the transmission line impedance and injected node power of the unified power flow controller (UPFC), the UPFC represents FACTS. In addition, the requirement on the computational time for mitigation control is limited, and this paper discusses the application of UPFC for mitigating cascading failures in a DC optimal power flow environment. The control variables include the impedance of the transmission line embedded with the UPFC and the injected active power of the nodes at the two ends of the transmission line.|$|E

The series converter of the UPFC controls the transmission line real/reactive power flow and the shunt converter of the UPFC controls the UPFC bus voltage/shunt reactive power and the DC link capacitor voltage. The real power demand of the series converter is supplied by the shunt converter of the UPFC via the DC link capacitor. The control of transmission line reactive power flow leads to excessive voltage excursion of the UPFC bus voltage. In this proposed work, we have considered two system cases. The first case is to cause a sudden increase in the system load. The second case is to introduce a transient fault in the system. In both cases, excessive bus voltage excursions occur.

A contemporary solution to this issue is by adding power system stabilizer (PSS) to the generator's automatic voltage regulator (AVR). Although nowadays most of the generators are equipped with conventional PSSs, their effects are only noticed on the damping of local oscillations and they do not contribute effectively on damping the inter-area oscillations. Adding auxiliary signals (stabilizing signals) to Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) device such as Static VAr Compensator (SVC) &Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) would help in extending the power transfer capability and enhancing the voltage.
