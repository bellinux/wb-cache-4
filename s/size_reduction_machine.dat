40|$|The <b>Size</b> <b>Reduction</b> <b>Machine</b> (SRM) is {{a mobile}} {{platform}} capable of shearing various shapes {{and types of}} metal components {{at a variety of}} elevations. This shearing activity can be performed without direct physical movement and placement of the shear head by the operator. The base unit is manually moved and roughly aligned to each cut location. The base contains the electronics: hydraulic pumps, servos, and actuators needed to move the shear-positioning arm. The movable arm allows the shear head to have six axes of movement and to cut to within 4 inches of a wall surface. The unit has a slick electrostatic capture coating to assist in external decontamination. Internal contamination of the unit is controlled by a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter on the cooling inlet fan. The unit is compact enough to access areas through a 36 -inch standard door opening.

Bakelite waste is prohibited from disposing of direct landfilling and open burning because of the improper disposal and emission reasons. A large amount of this waste needs the large safe space of warehouse area for keeping which becomes a waste management problem. <b>Size</b> <b>reduction</b> by milling <b>machine</b> is helpful for waste handling and storing, however, the post-milling waste Bakelite plastic utilization shall be studied to maintain the waste storing capacity. There are some studies of the milling machine used for waste plastic <b>size</b> <b>reduction.</b> However, the particular study of milling machine application for waste <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> and its milling waste utilization is still insufficient in Thailand. The purpose of this research is the use of waste Bakelite aggregate milling machine for Bakelite waste <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> and use of the post-milling waste Bakelite as a fine aggregate to replace natural sand material in cement mortar. The waste Bakelite fine aggregate (WBFA) was mixed in cement mortar mixture with the proportion 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % and 100 % by volume for cement mortar sample preparation. The mortar sample was tested for compressive strength follow ASTM standard. The compressive test result of mortar samples will be compared between conventional mortar (0 % WBFA) and waste Bakelite mortar (WBM) as well as comparing with the mortar standard. From an analysis of the sample test data found that the WBFA content in cement mortar mixture can predict the strength of WBM. The compressive strength of WBM at 28 Â days age with the fraction of WBFA is not exceeded 11. 03 %, and 23. 08 % respectively can be met the mortar standard according to the equation. The utilization of WBM to develop mortar non-structural mortar product can be usable from a technical point of view...|$|R

The success of the particle <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> processes depends on critical {{factors such as the}} employed technology, equipment, and drug physicochemical properties. High pressure homogenization and wet bead milling are standard comminution techniques that have been already employed to successfully formulate poorly soluble drugs and bring them to market.
