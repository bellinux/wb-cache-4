40|$|The {{contribution}} {{outlines the}} national system for identifying changing <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> in the UK, and briefly reviews corresponding work at regional, local and sectoral levels. It mentions the main methods used for assessing changing educational and training {{needs in the}} UK at various levels. The recent focus on local assessment of <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> in the UK has resulted in an explosion of research, with an immense number of detailed studies being undertaken. The chapter describes the changing institutional arrangements for identifying <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> and delivering education and training, and reviews the significance of such changes in the UK over recent years, focusing on both technical and institutional issues. It also offers a more critical perspective {{on the role of}} the State in anticipating changing <b>skill</b> <b>needs.</b> ...|$|R

The data is {{organized}} by assessing the members of BigCo’s Corporate IT group regarding their present IT skill levels and the perception of <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> both now and three years in the future. This work relies on a categorization drawn from both academic and professional literature regarding <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> for IT professionals. In doing this work we draw on surveys, interviews, focus groups and archival documents to build a rich and detailed perspective on <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> for the IT professionals at BigCo’s Corporate IT group. Findings show that there is an implicit set of conceptual IT skills that IT professionals are expected to have. Further, the non-IT <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> are presently very important and are expected to become even more important. Finally, there are important department-level, experience, and gender variations in the responses suggesting that IT roles are growing both more numerous and more specialized...|$|R

However, since its first publication in 2010, {{little research has been}} done to understand whether these competencies align with the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> to be successful student affairs professionals. This qualitative study examined mid-level supervisors’ perceptions of the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> for effective entry-level student affairs work and compared these responses to the ACPA/NASPA competencies. Mid-level manager’s perceptions of skills aligned with stated competencies with some minor discrepancies noted. These findings have implications for practice, graduate preparation programs, potential revisions to the competencies and future research...|$|R

40|$|Widening {{university}} {{participation is}} arguably {{one of the}} largest changes occurring within the contemporary university (Biggs and Tang 2011); with many universities offering enabling programs to provide a supported transition to university for students from equity groups. In order to better inform enabling program curriculum, 2012 commencing students at UniSA College were surveyed to determine the <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> they identified as important. These needs were compared to a known framework for university preparedness. There was found to be a significant match between the students’ identified <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> and Conley’s framework (2008) with regard to academic literacy. However other enabling program student identified <b>skill</b> <b>needs,</b> such as personal development, community input, and career preparation, were not supported by the framework. The research concludes that a separate framework should be determined for enabling program student <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> and that academics should engage in regular dialogue with students to develop curriculum which meets the specific needs of this growing cohort.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the question of}} organizational scale and scope, with applications to various industries, including financial services. We build a model in which new opportunities arise for firms, but the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> to exploit them effectively are unknown. Early investments in these new opportunities expand scope and allow firms to learn the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> to make more efficient production decisions later on. The value of scope expansion is thus increasing in the strategic uncertainty about the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> for future success in exploiting new opportunities. The disadvantage of early scope expansion is that it requires irreversible investments before actual demand is known. This demand uncertainty means potential losses since the investment cannot be recovered when demand does not materialize. Thus, early entry into a new activity involves a tradeoff, and this tradeoff works in favor of early entry under two conditions. First, theremustbesufficiently high strategic uncertainty about the <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> for success in th...|$|R

40|$|Data from {{a survey}} of 800 {{employers}} were used to investigate the effects of employer <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> on the wage levels and employment of newly hired workers, and especially on how these outcomes differ by race, gender,'and educational group. Results showed that very few new jobs were available to workers who lacked credentials such as diplomas or experience, or the job <b>skills</b> <b>needed</b> for daily task performance. This was true even of jobs that did not require college degiees. The hiring and task performance requirements of new jobs were associated with lower employment of blacks relative to whites within each gender. They also had significant effects on starting hourly wages, even after controlling for educational attainment of the worker. The effects of employer <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> on employment patterns help to account {{for some of the}} observed differences in hourly wages across racial and educational groups, especially among men. Recent trends over time seem consistent with these findings, along with evidence that <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> have been rising among employers. Results also indicate that discriminatory employer preferences across racial groups play some role in determining employment outcomes for these groups, even after controlling for <b>skill</b> <b>needs.</b> (Contains 6 tables and 44 references.)
