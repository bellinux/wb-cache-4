40|$|We {{construct}} {{examples of}} <b>shrinkers</b> and expanders for Lagrangian mean curvature flows. These examples are Hamiltonian stationary and asymptotic {{to the union}} of two Hamiltonian stationary cones found by Schoen and Wolfson in [SW]. The Schoen-Wolfson cones Cp,q are obstructions to the existence problems of special Lagrangians or Lagrangian minimal surfaces in the variational approach. It is known that these cone singularities cannot be resolved by any smooth oriented Lagrangian submanifolds. The <b>shrinkers</b> and expanders that we found can be glued together to yield solutions of the Brakke motiona weak formulation of the mean curvature flow. For any coprime pair (p,q) other than (2, 1), we construct such a solution that resolves any single Schoen-Wolfson cone Cp,q. This thus provides an evidence to Schoen-Wolfson’s conjecture that the (2, 1) cone is the only area-minimizing cone. Higher dimensional generalizations are also obtained. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{two of my}} projects. Chapter 1 and 2 describe the behavior of 1 -dimensional [lambda]-self <b>shrinkers,</b> which are also known as [lambda]-curves in other literature. Chapter 3 and 4 focus on the estimation of the asymptotic behavior of the nodal set of biharmonic Steklov problems. Chapter 1 gives the background of mean curvature flow {{and the importance of}} self-shrinkers as solitons of the flow equation. We also introduce the background of the [lambda]-hypersurface and explain how this is related to the self <b>shrinkers.</b> In chapter 2, we examine the solutions of 1 -dimensional [lambda]-self <b>shrinkers</b> and show that for certain [lambda] < 0, there are some closed, embedded solutions other than circles. For negative [lambda] near zero, there are embedded solutions with 2 -symmetry. For negative [lambda] with large absolute value, there are embedded solutions with m-symmetry, where m is greater than 2. Chapter 3 focuses on the background of spectral geometry. Several eigenvalue problems are introduced. We have a brief survey of some of the important problems such as the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues, the shape optimization problem and the bound of nodal sets. This project focuses on establishing a lower bound of the measure of the nodal set. In chapter 4, we use layer potential to establish that the boundary biharmonic Steklov operators are elliptic pseudo-differential operators. Thus we are able to establish lower bounds on both the measure of boundary nodal sets and interior nodal sets for biharmonic Steklov eigenfunctions. by Jui-En Chang. Thesis: Ph.
