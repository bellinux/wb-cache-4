5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Operation Mascot, Tirpitz {{continued}} to prepare for potential combat operations. Following trials in the sheltered waters of Altafjord, <b>she</b> <b>put</b> to sea on 31 July and 1 August to train with her protective destroyers. Additional smoke generators were also installed around Kaafjord to improve the area's already strong defences. These activities were reported by spies, and the British Admiralty interpreted them to mean that Tirpitz was being readied for a raid against Allied shipping. To defend against this threat, {{it was decided to}} conduct further attacks against the battleship at her anchorage in Kaafjord {{at the time of the}} next series of Arctic convoys. In reality, the German Navy was not planning to use Tirpitz offensively as she would be very vulnerable to the superior Allied naval and air forces if <b>she</b> <b>put</b> to sea. Instead, the battleship was being maintained in active service to tie down Allied warships and aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, Wintour {{returned}} to New York {{to take over}} House & Garden. Its circulation had long lagged behind rival Architectural Digest, and Condé Nast hoped she could improve it.

5|$|On 31 December 1918, Wadsworth {{stood out}} of Brest {{to return to the}} United States and reached Boston, Massachusetts, on 9January 1919. Following an {{extended}} overhaul, <b>she</b> <b>put</b> to sea on 1May to serve as one of the picket ships stationed at intervals across the ocean for the transatlantic flight of four Curtiss NC flying boats, one of which, NC-4, successfully completed the feat. The destroyer returned home and operated on the east coast through the summer of 1919. On 29August, Wadsworth was placed in reduced commission at Philadelphia where she remained almost two years. On 9May 1921, the destroyer returned to active service along the east coast.|$|E
5|$|<b>She</b> <b>put</b> to sea in late December with 103 Marines to {{reinforce}} their detachment at Johnston Island (about 750 nautical miles—860 miles, or 1,390km—west of Hawaii), and evacuated 47 civilians to Hawaii the following month. A convoy assignment took Mahan to Samoa, where she joined Task Force 17 (including the carrier , two cruisers and five destroyers). The task force carried out raids on Jaluit Atoll, Mili Atoll and Makin Atoll (Butaritari) in the Marshall Islands and Gilbert Islands. Mahan {{moved on to}} Canton Island in late February 1942, temporarily assigned to offshore patrol duty. By early April, she was at sea with a convoy bound for San Pedro, California. The ship then steamed north to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul, docking on 18 April 1942.|$|E
5|$|The V-2 {{damage to}} Timothy Bloodworth was {{considered}} slight, {{so it did}} not prevent her from sailing from Antwerp two days later. On 30 December, she left Liverpool for New York and arrived on 13 January 1945.

She did not progress to the final round.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crisis}} abated, Arizona {{was ordered to}} Constantinople (now Istanbul) before she sailed for home on 15 June. <b>She</b> <b>put</b> into the New York Navy Yard on 30 June for an overhaul, where six 5-inch guns were removed and the fire control system was modernized. Work was {{completed}} in January 1920 and the battleship sailed south to Guantanamo Bay for crew training. During this time, Arizona was fitted with a flying-off platform {{similar to the one}} given to Texas in March 1919. In April, Arizona lost the Battenberg Cup to Nevada, and in June she was present for the Naval Academy's graduation ceremonies. In August she became the flagship of Battleship Division Seven, although it was only later in 1920 that the battleship was refitted to be an admiral's flagship.|$|E
5|$|Dresden saw {{action in}} the Battle of Coronel in November, where she engaged the British cruiser , and at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December, where {{she was the only}} German warship to escape destruction.

Her engines were worn out and she had almost no coal left for her boilers, so the ship's captain {{contacted}} the local Chilean authorities to have Dresden interned. She was trapped by British cruisers, including her old opponent Glasgow. The British violated Chilean neutrality and opened fire on the ship in the Battle of Más a Tierra. The Germans scuttled Dresden and the majority of the crew escaped to be interned in Chile {{for the duration of the}} war. The wreck remains in the harbor; several artifacts, including her bell and compass, have been returned to Germany.|$|E
