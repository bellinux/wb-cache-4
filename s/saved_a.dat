5|$|The {{first chance}} {{of the second}} half fell to Liverpool, but midfielder Zenden sent his shot wide of the Chelsea goal. The first {{substitution}} of the half came in the 54th minute, when Chelsea replaced Geremi with Wayne Bridge. A minute later, they had two chances to take the lead. Reina <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> shot by Didier Drogba and from the resulting corner, he <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> Shevchenko header. Liverpool made their first substitutions of the match minutes when Aurélio, Steven Gerrard and Xabi Alonso replaced González, Zenden and Pennant respectively.

5|$|At Berlin, Franck {{attended}} lectures by Max Planck and Emil Warburg. On 28 July 1904 he <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> pair {{of children}} from drowning in the Spree River. For his Doctor of Philosophy (Dir. Phil.) under Warburg's supervision, Warburg suggested that he study corona discharges. Franck found this topic too complex, so he changed the focus of his thesis. Entitled Über der Beweglichkeit Ladungsträger der Spitzenentladung ("On the Mobility of Ions"), it would subsequently {{be published in the}} Annalen der Physik.|$|E

5|$|Banks {{made what}} he {{believed}} to be three of the best saves {{of his career in}} a Stoke shirt. In the first instance he saved and caught a powerful and well-placed header from Manchester City's Wyn Davies from just eight yards out; in the second case he <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> Francis Lee header at Maine Road; and he made his third great save for the club by catching a volley from Tottenham Hotspur's Alan Gilzean that had been hit from just six yards out at White Hart Lane.|$|E

She is sent flying through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E

The next day in the last regular season game, two home runs were hit off Hoffman before he <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> 7–6 {{win over the}} Diamondbacks, earning the Padres their second consecutive NL West title. He was named MLB Delivery Man of the Month for September after being 10for11 in save opportunities and striking out 13 batters over 12.0 innings and allowing only seven hits. Hoffman saved 46 of 51 save chances on the year, and led the NL in saves {{for the second time}}. His 11th 30-save season set an MLB record, while his eighth 40-save season extended his record. His season save total was the second highest in his career. Hoffman won the Rolaids Relief Award {{for the second time in}} his career, was awarded The Sporting News NL Reliever of the Year for the third time, and finished as the runner-up for the Cy Young Award for the second time. In the playoffs, the Padres faced the Cardinals in the NLDS again. Down 2–0 in the series, Hoffman saved Game 3 in a 3–1 win to avoid elimination. However, the Padres lost the series 3–1 as their offense managed only six runs in the four games against the eventual 2006 World Series champions.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, Miami-Dade Transit {{initiated}} a monthlong pilot program for express service between key stations during rush hours. During morning rush, many stations are skipped {{from the north}} and south en route to downtown, and in the afternoon, stations are skipped as the trains leave downtown. The service was well received, though it only <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> few minutes' time, partially due to the headway limitations with a system only having two tracks. The service continued past December.|$|E

Simone Laudehr scored a second goal after 86 minutes, which sealed the German 2–0 victory.

5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that Observers are time travelers, {{as they have been}} {{documented}} during several major events in history. They write in an incomprehensible language, and the number of Observer sightings has increased over the past few months, leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other Observers, who are not happy that he <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> girl who was supposed to die in the plane crash. To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that he has to make her important.|$|E

Skinner tells Mulder of Craig's death and admits that this would have been an X-File had they still been open. Mulder raises his discontentment claiming that with X-Files, a certain pair of agents could have <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> life. Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone, implying the decision was not his and came from higher up the chain of command.|$|E

5|$|During the 2003–04 season, Robinson scored {{his first}} {{professional}} goal, a header against Swindon Town {{in the closing}} moments of a League Cup match. The goal levelled the scores and forced extra time; with no further goals scored during extra time, the match then went to a penalty shoot-out. Robinson <b>saved</b> <b>a</b> penalty, whilst a Swindon player missed another one by hitting the post, resulting in Leeds winning the match. Leeds were subsequently relegated from the Premier League that season, with Robinson conceding 75 goals in 36 matches, being sent off in one match. He made 119 appearances in total for Leeds, 95 in the Premier League, during his seven-year spell at the club, and was also voted Player of the Year by the Leeds United supporters' club in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Former {{teammate}} Ian Snodin {{invited him}} to join Football Conference side Doncaster Rovers on a short-term deal {{at the start of}} the 1997–98 season.
