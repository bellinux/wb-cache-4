50|$|For the <b>star</b> <b>mapper</b> results, {{the data}} {{analysis}} {{was carried out by}} the Tycho Data Analysis Consortium (TDAC). The Tycho Catalogue comprises more than one million stars with 20-30 milliarc-sec astrometry and two-colour (B and V band) photometry.|$|E
50|$|A more {{extensive}} {{analysis of the}} <b>star</b> <b>mapper</b> (Tycho) data extracted additional faint stars from the data stream. Combined with old photographic plate observations made several decades earlier {{as part of the}} Astrographic Catalogue programme, the Tycho-2 Catalogue of more than 2.5 million stars (and fully superseding the original Tycho Catalogue) was published in 2000.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of CCDs to star trackers and <b>star</b> <b>mappers</b> is considered. Advantages {{and disadvantages of}} silicon CCD star trackers are {{compared with those of}} image dissector star trackers. It is concluded that the CCD has adequate sensitivity for most single star tracking tasks and is distinctly superior in multiple star tracking or mapping applications. The signal and noise figures of several current CCD configurations are discussed. The basic structure of the required signal processing is described, and it is shown that resolution in excess of the number of CCD elements may be had by interpolation...|$|R

The systems considered are fixed and gimbaled <b>star</b> trackers, <b>star</b> <b>mappers,</b> and digital sun sensors. Covariance analyses were performed to determine performance for the most promising candidate in low altitude and synchronous orbits. The performance of attitude estimators that employ gyroscopes which are periodically updated by a star sensor is established by a single axis covariance analysis.

40|$|Gaia is ESA's ambitious space {{astrometry}} mission the main objective {{of which is}} to astrometrically and spectro-photometrically map 1000 Million celestial objects (mostly in our galaxy) with unprecedented accuracy. The announcement of opportunity for the data processing will be issued by ESA late in 2006. The Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) has been formed recently and is preparing an answer. The satellite will downlink close to 100 TB of raw telemetry data over 5 years. To achieve its required accuracy of a few 10 s of Microarcsecond astrometry, a highly involved processing of this data is required. In addition to the main astrometric instrument Gaia will host a Radial Velocity instrument, two low-resolution dispersers for multi-color photometry and two <b>Star</b> <b>Mappers.</b> Gaia is a flying Giga Pixel camera. The various instruments each require relatively complex processing {{while at the same time}} being interdependent. We describe the overall composition of the DPAC and the envisaged overall architecture of the Gaia data processing system. We shall delve further into the core processing - one of the nine, so-called, coordination units comprising the Gaia processing system. Comment: 10 Pages, 2 figures.

50|$|The Tycho-2 {{positions}} and magnitudes {{are based on}} the observations collected by the <b>star</b> <b>mapper</b> of the European Space Agency's Hipparcos satellite. They are the same observations used to compile the Tycho-1 Catalogue (ESA SP-1200, 1997). However, Tycho-2 is much larger and a bit more precise, because a more advanced reduction technique was used.|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} photomultiplier system viewed a {{beam splitter}} in the optical path and {{was used as a}} <b>star</b> <b>mapper.</b> Its purpose was to monitor and determine the satellite attitude, and in the process, to gather photometric and astrometric data of all stars down to about 11th magnitude. These measurements were made in two broad bands approximately corresponding to B and V in the (Johnson) UBV photometric system. The positions of these latter stars were to be determined to a precision of 0.03 arc-sec, which is a factor of 25 less than the main mission stars. Originally targeting the observation of around 400,000 stars, the resulting Tycho Catalogue comprised just over 1 million stars, with a subsequent analysis extending this to the Tycho-2 Catalogue of about 2.5 million stars.|$|E
50|$|The highest {{accuracy}} photometric {{data were}} provided as {{a by-product of}} the main mission astrometric observations. They were made in a broad-band visible light passband, specific to Hipparcos, and designated Hp. The median photometric precision, for Hp<9 mag, was 0.0015 mag, with typically 110 distinct observations per star throughout the 3.5-year observation period. As part of the data reductions and catalogue production, new variables were identified and designated with appropriate variable star identifiers. Variable stars were classified as periodic or unsolved variables; the former were published with estimates of their period, variability amplitude, and variability type. In total some 11,597 variable objects were detected, of which 8237 were newly classified as variable. There are, for example, 273 Cepheid variables, 186 RR Lyr variables, 108 Delta Scuti variables, and 917 eclipsing binary stars. The <b>star</b> <b>mapper</b> observations, constituting the Tycho (and Tycho-2) Catalogue, provided two colours, roughly B and V in the Johnson UBV photometric system, important for spectral classification and effective temperature determination.|$|E
40|$|Between 1989 and 1995, 10 micro {{satellites}} {{were constructed}} using SSTL 2 ̆ 7 s 50 kg modular micro satellite design. Eight are presently in orbit, while two {{are scheduled for}} launches during summer 1995. Each satellite has incorporated design enhancements, which can be grouped roughly into six distinct design generations. This rapid design and test cycle, combined with in-orbit operational experience, has fostered rapid advancement of technology within the basic modular design. When measured between the two extremes, the technological advance is startling. UoSAT- 3 (launched 1990) contained three on-board computers and just over four megabytes of solid-state data storage. FaSAT-Alfa (to be launch 1995) contains 21 on-board computers and greater than 260 megabytes of solid-state data storage. Attitude determination sensors have expanded to incorporate <b>star</b> <b>mappers</b> and sun sensors and horizon sensors {{in addition to the}} three-axis magnetometer. Earth imaging cameras have gone from 2 - kilometro resolution to 100 -metre resolution in four generations. This technological change has been rapid but incremental. By using items with flight heritage in redundant configurations with new items, confidence is maintained without thwarting advancement. Operational impacts are equally important: the safety of the spacecraft and the execution of basic mission functions depend upon proven operational techniques. New techniques are used experimentally to build operational experience. For example, FaSAT-Alfa carries a reaction wheel for yaw control, but the satellite will still be essentially gravity-gradient stabilized. If an experimental bus subsystem succeeds, it enhances the mission, if not, the mission is not lost. A similar mixture of aggressive advance mixed with conservative system design is being applied to SSTL 2 ̆ 7 s new 300 kg multipurpose minisatellite. SSTL 2 ̆ 7 s first mini satellite (slated for a 1996 launch) will re-use some micro satellite subsystems and concepts, while pushing forward where required. Power generation, attitude control, and orbit-control systems all require redial advances from the present microsatellite. On-board data handling communications and telemetry and telecommand subsystems can serve the larger bus without radical changes. This paper reviews SSTL 2 ̆ 7 s micro satellite and mini satellite systems, using them to illustrate how small satellites built on rapid timescales permit the safe deployment of new technology. It emphasizes the advantages of making incremental rather then revolutionary changes in operational complexity from mission to mission...|$|R
40|$|The {{pressurized}} lunar rover (PLR) {{consists of}} a 7 m long, 3 m diameter cylindrical main vehicle and a trailer which houses the power and heat rejection systems. The main vehicle carries the astronauts, life support systems, navigation and communication systems, directional lighting, cameras, and equipment for exploratory experiments. The PLR shell is constructed of a layered carbon-fiber/foam composite. The rover has six 1. 5 m diameter wheels on the main body and two 1. 5 m diameter wheels on the trailer. The wheels are constructed of composites and flex to increase traction and shock absorption. The wheels are each attached to a double A-arm aluminum suspension, which allows each wheel 1 m of vertical motion. In conjunction with a 0. 75 m ground clearance, the suspension aids the rover in negotiating the uneven lunar terrain. The 15 N-m torque brushless electric motors are mounted with harmonic drive units inside each of the wheels. The rover is steered by electrically varying the speeds of the wheels {{on either side of}} the rover. The PLR trailer contains a radiosotope thermoelectric generator providing 6. 7 kW. A secondary back-up energy storage system for short-term high-power needs is provided by a bank of batteries. The trailer can be detached to facilitate docking of the main body with the lunar base via an airlock located in the rear of the PLR. The airlock is also used for EVA operation during missions. Life support is a partly regenerative system with air and hygiene water being recycled. A layer of water inside the composite shell surrounds the command center. The water absorbs any damaging radiation, allowing the command center to be used as a safe haven during solar flares. Guidance, navigation, and control are supplied by a strapdown inertial measurement unit that works with the on-board computer. <b>Star</b> <b>mappers</b> provide periodic error correction. The PLR is capable of voice, video, and data transmission. It is equipped with two 5 W X-band transponder, allowing simultaneous transmission and reception. An S-band transponder is used to communicate with the crew during EVA. The PLR has a total mass of 6197 kg. It has a nominal speed of 10 km/hr and a top speed of 18 km/hr. The rover is capable of towing 3 metric tons (in addition to the RTG trailer) ...|$|R

40|$|The ESA space-astrometry mission Hipparcos {{will provide}} a uniform and high-precision stellar {{catalogue}} of the whole sky. The data processing requires that the star coordinates in-the telescope focal plane {{be transformed into a}} common inertial reference frame. To correctly perform this transformation, the satellite three-axes attitude must be reconstituted within a specified accuracy (rms error of less than 0. 1 arcsec on each angle) for the mission lifetime, by processing the data of the on-board attitude sensors: <b>star</b> <b>mapper</b> and gyros. In this paper, after an overview of the Hipparcos mission, the attitude reconstitution is formulated as a Gauss-Markov estimation problem and solved by processing only <b>star</b> <b>mapper</b> data.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{demonstration of}} the feasibility of using a V-slit <b>star</b> <b>mapper</b> to meet the sensitivity and accuracy of on-board navigational requirements for future Pioneer Missions to the outer planets was conducted by the Control and Sensors Laboratory of TRW. The breadboard was extremely simple in configuration, consisting of an end-on photomultiplier tube and a V-slit reticle located at the focal plane of the objective lens. In addition, a plano-convex lens was used between the reticle and the PMT in a Fabry-Perot configuration. The analytical effort indicated that the sensor should easily meet the requirements. The Pioneer SRA test set was examined to determine its basic accuracy and modify it where necessary to bring its accuracy into the 1 - 3 arc second range. The test results show that it is feasible to use this type of <b>star</b> <b>mapper</b> in the 10 arc second accuracy range. The test equipment accuracy (approximately 5 arc Sec) was sufficient to bound the sensor errors at less than 10 arc seconds...|$|E

40|$|The Hipparcos <b>star</b> <b>mapper</b> {{detector}} background signal {{has been}} analyzed in the Tycho reductions for contributions {{due to the}} diffuse galactic light.

A complete sky background map, with a resolution of 0. 25 square degrees and based on the data accumulated through almost two years of the mission is presented. 1. Introduction The Hipparcos satellite has scanned the sky closely following a pre-defined scanning law (Perryman and Vaghi, 1989). This scanning law provided a complete coverage of the sky every 6 months, while keeping the two fields of view of the telescope at least 47 degrees away from the direction to the sun. This was obtained by letting the satellite rotate around its z-axis once every 2 h 8 m, and letting the satellite's z axis rotate at a constant angle of 43 degr [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Tycho Catalogue of {{a million}} stars is described. The median value of the {{internal}} standard errors is 25 mas for the position components and 0. 10 mag for the B T, V T colour index. For stars brighter than V T = 9 mag the median precision is 7 mas and 0. 019 mag, respectively. The external astrometric standard errors have been determined by comparison with the Hipparcos Catalogue and are respectively 1. 1 and 1. 5 times larger for V T # 10 mag and at V T = 10 : 5 mag. The photon counts from the Hipparcos <b>star</b> <b>mapper</b> were the basic data used to derive the Tycho Catalogue.
