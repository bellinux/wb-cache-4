30|$|A typical {{example is}} madder. At {{the end of}} the 18 th and during the 19 th century, German and English chemists tried to imitate Turkey red, also known as Rouge d’Andrinopole [4], based on madder. Various {{extraction}} methods from the raw material were tested, yielding products with slightly different names, such as Brown Madder (obtained in 1840 by using copper and iron sulphates instead of alum and potassium/sodium carbonate as a substrate for the precipitation of the lake pigment). The availability of sulphuric and <b>sulphurous</b> <b>acids</b> allowed further experiments to be performed, leading to the isolation of alizarin and purpurin in 1826. By modulating the extraction process, it became possible to obtain different modified madder-based products, e.g. garancine (1828), enriched in alizarin and purpurin, and Kopp’s purpurin (also known in France as “purpurine commerciale”), enriched in both purpurin and pseudopurpurin [4]. Fermenting madder prior to treatment in diluted sulphuric acid yields the so-called “carmine de garance”, supposedly pure madder dyestuff without the addition of an inorganic salt.|$|R

25|$|The Greenside smelt mill {{was built}} in 182728, down in the Glenridding valley {{at the bottom of}} the Swart Beck, where there was a good water supply and where fuel could be brought up the valley without too much difficulty. Inside the mill there was {{probably}} a furnace to prepare the ore and a single ore hearth. The air blast was produced by bellows powered by a water wheel. Further buildings were erected in the 1830s, to house a slag hearth furnace, and a silver refinery. There was no extended chimney: clouds of toxic lead oxides and <b>acid</b> <b>sulphurous</b> fumes would have made the valley an unhealthy place. The flue {{was built in}} 1841 to a chimney 150m up the hillside; in 1855 it was extended to a chimney on the ridge above. Later, loops were added to increase its length. This long flue not only removed the noxious fumes, it also enabled the lead-rich dust to be recovered and returned to the smelter. The flue was built as a stone-arched cutting, following or cut into the bedrock. This served as a giant prospecting cross-cut and proved there was no extension to the Greenside Vein to the south.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{limited number}} of papers report {{experimental}} corrosion data {{in the presence of}} flue gas impurities like SOx, NOx and O 2. When SO 2, water and O 2 are present, <b>sulphurous</b> and/or sulphuric <b>acid</b> (H 2 SO 3 and H 2 SO 4) might form. The minimum water concentration required for acid formation is not known, but the presence of FeSO 3 and/or FeSO 4 on the corroded surface in some experiments indicate that the reactions occur at water concentrations far below the water solubility in pure CO 2 -water systems. The corrosiveness increases considerably when NOx is present. NO 2 is highly soluble in water and reacts with water to produce nitric acid and NO under atmospheric conditions. The same type of reaction probably occurs in the dense phase CO 2 system. Experimental results indicate that the rust-like dusty products formed does not efficiently reduce the corrosion rate. There is {{limited number of}} papers presenting data and discussing the effect of combined impurities on corrosion. When both, NO 2 and SO 2 are present, NO 2 catalyzes the oxidation of SO 2 to form sulphuric acid. In addition, in the presence of H 2 S, elemental sulphur can form. Such interactions between impurities are especially dangerous when network pipeline systems are considered and CO 2 streams from different sources and with different impurities are mixed. As a result two non-corrosive streams can become very corrosive if highly corrosive acids are formed {{as a result of the}} reaction between added impurities...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis {{continues}} to be a major world health problem, causing more deaths than any other bacterial disease. Long treatment durations using a complex cocktail of drugs are often associated with patient non-adherence to therapy, and this has accelerated the development of drug resistant strains. Tuberculosis drug resistance has developed to the extent that some strains are resistant to all clinically used drugs. Therefore novel tuberculosis treatment drugs are urgently required to combat these resistant strains, sterilise latent infections and reduce lengthy treatment durations. This research developed and optimised a high-throughput assay to screen chemical libraries for compounds with anti-mycobacterial activity. The assay utilised fast growing tuberculosis model species M. smegmatis expressing foreign green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP allowed bacterial growth inhibition to be measured both by fluorescence in addition to absorbance. The assay was expanded to four different culture conditions two of which were nutrient starvation that better mimicked environmental conditions M. tuberculosis is exposed to during infection. These differential culture conditions also revealed previously unidentified mycobacterial inhibitors. Three chemical libraries totaling over 5, 000 compounds were screened in the different culture conditions. Seleno-amino acids (Se-AAs), a novel class of anti-tuberculosis compounds, were discovered through screens in nutrient starvation conditions. Based on traits of strong inhibitory activity towards mycobacteria, low human cell line cytotoxicity, structural novelty and known over-the-counter sale as a non-prescription dietary supplement, the Se-AAs were chosen as a promising pharmacophore for further study. Using evidence derived from anti-sense gene knockdown, transposon mutagenesis and biochemical enzyme assays, a pro-drug hypothesis of anti-mycobacterial activity was proposed that involved Se-AAs being transported into the mycobacterial cell by nutrient uptake transporters and subsequent cleavage into catalytically active methylselenium species by lyase enzymes used in mycobacterial <b>sulphurous</b> amino <b>acid</b> metabolism. The activated methylselenium is reduced by mycobacterial redox homeostasis enzymes involved in mycobacterial oxidative defence such as alkyl hydroperoxidases, generating reactive oxygen radical products that damage mycobacterial DNA, lipids and proteins. Reduced methylselenol can be cycled back to the oxidised state by cellular mycothiones, continuously generating damaging reactive oxygen species within the mycobacterial cell. Methylselenium species also disrupt essential mycobacterial processes, such as ketosteroid catabolism and iron-sulphur cluster protein function. In summary, this research has designed and implemented a novel dual label differential culture condition assay useful in the screening and detection of chemicals with anti-tuberculosis properties. A novel structural class of anti-tuberculosis compounds with therapeutic potential, the Se-AAs, was discovered using this assay, the structure-activity relationship of the Se-AAs was explored and a three-component model of Se-AA anti-tuberculosis activity is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{review of}} the {{chemistry}} of the benzodiazoles is largely confined to considerations of the four parent heterocyclic systems under investigation, namely, 1. 2. 3 -benzothiadiazole and 1, 2, 3 -benzoselenadiazole, 2. 1. 3 -beazothiadiazole and 2,l, 3 -benzoselenadiazole. The benzothiadiazoles and their selenium analogues only combine with one molecular proportion of quaternizing agent; while some bis- quaternaries have been prepared, di-quaternary salts are never obtained. The merits of various quaternizing agents, viz., alkyl iodides, dialkyl sulphates, alkyl p-toluenesulphonates, and alkyl 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphonates for the preparation of methyl and ethyl quaternary salts of these very weak bases are discussed, and the anions of such compounds are exchanged to form chlorides, bromides, iodides, perchlorates, thiocyanates and cyanides, with interesting properties. Though 1, 2, 3 -benzothiadiazole is an unsymmetrical compound, in practice {{only one of the}} three possible isomers of alkyl- 1, 2, 3 - benzothiadiazolium salts is obtained. The position of alkylation is considered in the light of evidence from reductive cleavage (to give N-alkyl-o-aminothiophenols), reaction with alkali and spectroscopic measurements; N(3) appears the most likely site. There is little doubt about the structure of alkyl- 2,l, 3 -benzothiadiazolium and -benzoselenadiazolium salts; their decomposition in water yields <b>sulphurous</b> or selenious <b>acid</b> and the N-alkyl-o-phenylenediamine. The alkyl 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphonates afford the best scope for obtaining higher alkyl quaternaries. The benzothiadiazoles and their selenium analogues undergo quaternization with n-propyl, n-butyl, n-amyl, iso-butyl and iso-amyl 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphorates, though thermal decomposition of the iso-alkyl esters is a serious problem. Secondary or tertiary alkyl 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphonates are unobtainable but very small quantities of sec. -alkyl quaternary iodides of l, 2, 3 -benzothiadiazole and 2, 1, 3 -benzoselenadiazole result from the use of iso-propyl iodide. Some polymethylene bis-quaternaries are prepared, especially by means of a convenient one-stage process involving heterocyclic base, ?,w-di-iodoalkane and silver 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphonate. The work done establishes that the effectiveness of the alkyl 2, 4 - dinitrobenzenesulphonates as quaternizing agents decreases as the series is ascended. Also, the reactivity of the parent bases decreases in the order [...] 1, 2, 3 -benzoselenadiazole > 2, 1, 3 -benzoselenadiazole > 1, 2, 3 -benzothiadiazole > 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazole and follows closely the magnitude of their pKa values, the determination of which gave important information concerning protonation...|$|R

60|$|Scientific {{definitions}}, {{whether they}} are definitions of scientific terms, or of common terms used in a scientific sense, are almost always of the kind last spoken of: their main purpose is {{to serve as the}} landmarks of scientific classification. And since the classifications in any science are continually modified as scientific knowledge advances, the definitions in the sciences are also constantly varying. A striking instance is afforded by the words Acid and Alkali, especially the former. As experimental discovery advanced, the substances classed with acids have been constantly multiplying, and by a natural consequence the attributes connoted by the word have receded and become fewer. At first it connoted the attributes, of combining with an alkali to form a neutral substance (called a salt); being compounded of a base and oxygen; causticity to the taste and touch; fluidity, etc. The true analysis of muriatic acid, into chlorine and hydrogen, caused the second property, composition from a base and oxygen, to be excluded from the connotation. The same discovery fixed the attention of chemists upon hydrogen as an important element in acids; and more recent discoveries having led to the recognition of its presence in sulphuric, nitric, and many other acids, where its existence was not previously suspected, there is now a tendency to include the presence of this element in the connotation of the word. But carbonic acid, silica, <b>sulphurous</b> <b>acid,</b> have no hydrogen in their composition; that property can not, therefore, be connoted by the term, unless those substances are no longer to be considered acids. Causticity and fluidity have long since been excluded from the characteristics of the class, by the inclusion of silica and many other substances in it; and the formation of neutral bodies by combination with alkalis, together with such electro-chemical peculiarities as this is supposed to imply, are now the only differentiæ which form the fixed connotation of the word Acid, as a term of chemical science.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCO 2 {{has been}} transported {{and used for}} EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) for more than 30 years with a good track record. Based on the good {{experiences}} {{it seems to be}} generally accepted that corrosion will be insignificant in CO 2 transport pipelines as long as the water content is well below the water solubility. The solubility in pure CO 2 at 100 bar is about 1900 - 3200 ppmv in the temperature range 4 - 25 °C. There is no consensus on what the actual target concentration for the maximum water content should be in the CO 2 to be transported, but it is often referred to 500 ppmv in the CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) literature. The question is whether this apparently safe water level also applies when glycols, amines and flue gas contaminants like SOx, NOx and O 2 are present in moderate amounts. These impurities dissolve readily in water and induce an aqueous phase at a much lower water concentration than the solubility limits reported for pure CO 2 and CO 2 contaminated with hydrocarbons. When SO 2, water and O 2 are present <b>sulphurous</b> and/or sulphuric <b>acid</b> (H 2 SO 3 and H 2 SO 4) might form. The minimum water concentration required for acid formation is not known, but the presence of FeSO 3 and/or FeSO 4 seen on steel surfaces exposed in dense phase CO 2 at low water content (less than 500 ppmv) shows that corrosion takes place when 100 - 344 ppmv SO 2 is present. The corrosion rate was further increased when NO 2 was added to the system. Rotating autoclave experiments run with steel exposed to 100 bar CO 2, 488 and 1220 ppmv water and 96 - 478 ppmv NO 2 resulted in weight loss corrosion rates of 0. 05 - 1. 6 mm/year. Typically less than 5 % of the added impurities were apparently consumed by corrosion in the NOx and SOx experiments before the corrosion rate slowed down. The difference in the impurity concentration at start up and when the experiment was terminated was much larger than the consumption estimated from corrosion. The impurities became apparently “non-active” during the exposure and it can be questioned if the measured corrosion rates in the present experiments and in other reported lab experiments reflect the worst case conditions in the pipeline. The experimental observations so far support the need for a dynamic test system with replenishment of impurities and instant (continuous) analyses of the dissolved impurity concentrations. Such dynamic tests are required in order to define acceptable CO 2 specifications with confidence...|$|R

Sulphide Creek, a tributary of the Moira River, flows through the community. Founded in 1836, the town was named for a series of local sulphur mines that were eventually terminated in the mid-1960s. The name of the town [...] "Sulphide" [...] came from the mineral that gave the town its existence. And it was by accident. A failed gold mine was reopened but what was found was not gold, it was pyrite, better known as '"fools gold". As luck would have it, the sulphide in the pyrites was exactly what a chemical company needed. In 1905, a chemical company erected a large acid plant for the manufacture of sulphuric and <b>sulphurous</b> <b>acid.</b> The company - Nichol's Mining Company and its workers built a town that included a school, churches, community center and homes for the workers. For nearly fifty years, the uranium mines in nearby Bancroft provided the market for the acids. Then, in 1964, the uranium market collapsed. The mine was subsequently closed and buried, the plant dismantled and the company houses demolished. Today, Sulphide is home to country living, with some of the original private houses re-occupied. Still, there are some reminders of the past that do exist.|$|E

5000|$|Even while Pagenstecher was {{starting}} up the Hudson River mill, in 1869 Illustrious Remington {{and his three}} sons, Hiram, Alfred D. and Charles R., were making a ton of newsprint daily in Watertown, New York, using four rag machines and an 84" [...] fourdrinier machine. By 1870, the Remingtons, seeing a future for wood pulp, built three mills on Sewall's Island in Watertown. These mills used the Voelter process allowing a low-cost, high-quality Remington newsprint {{to be made of}} 75% rags and 25% wood pulp instead of all-rag content paper costing five times more. A third invention caught the imagination of the Remingtons. In 1867, Benjamin Tilghman, an American chemist, discovered that <b>sulphurous</b> <b>acid</b> (H2SO3) dissolved the lignin in wood, leaving a residue of cellulose fibers. Nought came of this discovery. However, Alfred D. Remington learned that a Swede, Carl Daniel Ekman, was teaching papermakers in Sweden to make paper entirely out of wood pulp by using a sulphite process (SO3). Remington went to Sweden to see [...] "This Miracle" [...] for himself. He was so impressed that he imported Swedish chemical fiber for several years and later developed the [...] "sulphite process" [...] in his own plant on Sewall's Island. The Remingtons were selling newsprint to the New York Times. They received an order for ten tons stipulating that the newsprint contain no wood pulp! A. D. Remington, proud of his new product, sent it to the Times along with a note, asking them to try it. The reply was, [...] "come and get your paper", which he did. It wasn't long before the Times was eager and willing to buy this new and cheaper newsprint. The revolution in paper-making in the Black River region was complete: fourdrinier machines became bigger and bigger and faster and faster; the demand for spruce was insatiable and the lumbermen practically denuded the virgin forests; the unpleasant odor of the sulphite mills replaced the equally unpleasant odor of the tanneries. Other paper-makers, emulating the success of the Remingtons embarked on a costly program of mass-production of wood pulp newsprint.|$|E
