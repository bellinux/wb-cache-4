5|$|In 1723, the Commissioners of the Kent and Sussex Rother Levels {{employed}} the civil engineering contractor John Reynolds to make repairs to Scots Float Sluice, a timber {{lock on the}} lower river. He built a dovetailed <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall below the foundations, and the Commissioners offered him the job of maintaining the levels in 1725, for which he would be paid £65 per year. He moved to Iden and held the post for fourteen years. Silting of the river estuary caused mounting problems with the drainage of the levels during the 1720s. Reynolds carried out further work on the sluice in 1729, and in 1732 reconstructed it to provide an extra outlet. Several new channels were excavated through the levels in the early 1730s, {{so that all the}} runoff passed through Scots Float. Reynolds resigned his post in 1739 as he was too busy with other engineering projects.|$|E

2500|$|On 10 November 2005, {{an article}} in the Times-Picayune {{revealed}} that sonar soundings discovered that the steel sheet pilings of the levee floodwall were 2.1m (7ft) less deep than engineering specifications. Sample pilings pulled up were found to be of the length specified in the design (17 feet), but it was then revealed that this length was less than the actual depth of the canal, in retrospect an obvious engineering mistake. Current analysis concludes that the catastrophic breach was due to faulty design, rather than storm surge higher than what the canal was designed to withstand. According to an article published in the August 2015 issue of the official journal of the World Water Council, the Army Corps of Engineers misinterpreted the results of a <b>Sheet</b> <b>Pile</b> Load test (E-99 Study) conducted in the mid 1980s and concluded they needed to drive sheet pilings to depths of not more than 17 feet, rather than the necessary 31 to 46 feet. This move saved millions but greatly reduced overall engineering reliability.|$|E
2500|$|Flooding due to {{rain and}} storms {{has long been}} an issue since the New Orleans' early {{settlement}} due to the city's location on a delta marsh, much of which sits below sea level. The city is surrounded by the Mississippi River to the south, Lake Pontchartrain to the north, and Lake Borgne to the east. Construction of the levees along the River began soon after the city was founded, and more extensive river levees were built as the city grew. The levees were originally designed to prevent damage caused by seasonal flooding. Today, the floodwalls atop the 17th Street and London Avenue Canals are used for drainage, to pump water from the city streets out to Lake Pontchartrain. These floodwalls are one foot (300mm) wide at the top and widened to two feet (600mm) at the base. The visible portion is a concrete cap on steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> that anchors to the wall. [...] Sheet piles are interlocked steel columns, in this case at least 30 feet (10 m) long, with 6 to 10 feet (2 to 3 m) visible above ground; examinations afterward showed that some pilings were not as deep as specified. The wide, navigable Industrial Canal is used for shipping.|$|E
2500|$|By September 15, 2005, the {{inundation}} of {{the city}} had been reduced from 80% to 40%, although flooded areas were {{not expected to be}} habitable for a long while. In Orleans Parish, most of the Ninth Ward of New Orleans and the southern part of Orleans Parish were dry enough for normal recovery operations to begin. Water remained {{in the northern part of}} the parish and would be pumped out using Pump Stations 12 and 4, and reinforced with about a dozen temporary pumps. Pumping efforts in the lower Ninth Ward were removing water at a rate of [...] per day. Some construction work continued on the 17th Street and London Avenue canal breaches where helicopters were precision-placing 7,000-pound sandbags to reinforce existing repairs and crews were armoring sandbag closures with rock. Contractors maintained cranes at the sites to regulate flow levels by adjusting <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls at the mouths of the canals into Lake Pontchartrain. Construction of the access road to the second London Canal breach north of Mirabeau bridge was completed September 14. St. Bernard’s Parish was almost completely dry, with the only significant water remaining in the Chalmette extension. However, recovery in St. Bernard’s Parish was limited by the spill of petroleum products from local oil facilities. In Plaquemines Parish, repairs to the levee breaches continued and were almost ready for full scale pumping of the affected areas. Most of the fixed pumping stations in Plaquemines Parish had survived the storm.|$|E

He also patented a design for pre-fabricated multi-level roadways and one of his most important inventions, <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> revetments for waterways. [...] This invention has had a significant benefit for the reclamation of land in waterfront areas such as Cardiff Bay. The patent describes the solution as 'revetments or retaining walls for the banks of rivers or canals and concerns an arrangement, particularly suitable for rivers and canals which are relatively shallow at the banks, in which the revetment comprises a series of sheet metal plates arranged end-to-end and suitably secured together to form a wall of sheet metal pile sections, driven into the ground vertically by a power hammer and interlocked so that a complete wall of steel piles is provided between the bank and the water. The wall is retained by tie bars linking it to anchor plates set in the bank well inshore This system of piling is undoubtedly desirable, if not essential, for deep waterways or those subject to heavy erosion, such as tidal waters.' ...|$|E

40|$|Failure of (floodplain) river {{embankments}} {{is mainly}} due to internal erosion phenomena, hydraulic heave, mechanical instability triggered by seepage forces. In {{order to minimize}} the risk of internal erosion (piping) or hydraulic heave, the use of plastic diaphragm or <b>sheet</b> <b>piles</b> is recommended. The main advantage of <b>sheet</b> <b>piles</b> is the structural resistance of this type of barrier which contributes to the mechanical resistance of the embankment and provides a hydraulic barrier even in the case that overtopping of the embankment has caused the erosion of the bank itself on the country side. On the other hand, <b>sheet</b> <b>piles</b> are very expensive and subject to possible corrosion or thickness reduction because of aggressive water and parasite currents into the soil. Plastic diaphragms are less expensive than <b>sheet</b> <b>piles</b> and can be installed quickly without compromising the serviceability of the embankment. This last advantage is also typical of <b>sheet</b> <b>piles.</b> The (dry) deep - mixing technology for the construction of plastic diaphragms is shortly illustrated and the advantages of such a method are pointed out. Eventually the effectiveness of a trial diaphragm, that have been constructed inside an existing (floodplain) river embankment at the Bottacci site (Province of Lucca, Northern Tuscany, Italy), is shown after the occurrence of repeated floods. Direct controls of the diaphragm and the information obtained by a monitoring system installed inside the embankment have been used for such a purpose. The geotechnical characterization of the embankment and of the monitoring system is illustrated in a companion paper...|$|R
