40|$|A self-contained, {{portable}} Gram <b>staining</b> <b>apparatus</b> (GSA) {{has been}} developed {{for use in the}} microgravity environment on board the Space Station Freedom. Accuracy and reproducibility of this apparatus compared with the conventional Gram staining method were evaluated by using gram-negative and gram-positive controls and different species of bacteria grown in pure cultures. A subsequent study was designed to assess the performance of the GSA with actual specimens. A set of 60 human and environmental specimens was evaluated with the GSA and the conventional Gram staining procedure. Data obtained from these studies indicated that the GSA will provide the Gram staining capability needed for the microgravity environment of space...|$|E
40|$|A {{device for}} {{staining}} ultrathin sections on formvar-coated slotted grids is described. It {{consisted of a}} plexiglass base with slots that supported the grids and a top which is secured by wing nuts. When placed together the two portions enclose a chamber. An input port, controlled by a three-way valve, allowed either staining solutions or distilled water to flow into the chamber. An output port allowed the solutions to flow out. A large number of grids can be stained simultaneously without the risk of contamination. The grids are handled infrequently, therefore the formvar coat is maintained intact. Uniform staining of sections is achieved and a small quantity of stain is used (3 ml/ 20 grids). Key words = slotted grid: formvar coat: staining (uranyl acetate, lead citrate) Various devices {{have been used to}} stain ultrathin sections on mesh and slotted grids for electron microscopic observations. These include cut pieces of polyethylene tubing, 1 "" slotted sheets of polyvinyl/ 1 the use of dental wax on glass slides, 61 or flexible rubber holders. 6 ' All of these devices were proposed to lessen exposure to atmospheric conditions, eliminate contamination from heavy metal stains, and reduce excessive handling of the grids. From our experience, contamination from dental wax is difficult to avoid. Also, should the flexible rubber in Baratz's device be inadvertently bent during the procedure, the grids will fall out. In Hiroaka's device the exposure to atmospheric COj is not greatly reduced. " The device used in the present method is especially useful in staining sections on formvar-coated slotted grids. Any device which is secured to the edge of these grids has the potential of causing damage to the formvar coat. In all of the devices noted above, the grids are squeezed into a slot. A staining chamber which has been used in our labora-tory for many years and which prevents damage to the formvar coat of slotted grids is described with regard to its construction and use. <b>Staining</b> <b>apparatus.</b> This <b>staining</b> <b>apparatus</b> called a Ribas Kurtz perfusion chamber for the collective staining of thin sections was obtained from Ladd Research Industries.

40|$|After {{fixing the}} bone marrow cells supravitally stained with neutral red by the method, the auther's own device as {{mentioned}} in Part 1, the author succeeded in detecting supravitally stained neutral red granules under the electronmicroscope. As the result, it has been clarified that neutral red does not <b>stain</b> Golgi <b>apparatus</b> specifically as generally believed nor does it stain specifically any other organellae in the cell. Namely, the dye is found within cytoplasma only {{in the form of}} dye droplets independent of organellae. It is assumed that the tendency of this dye-droplets gathering especially in the region of Golgi apparatus is due to the mechanism which attracts all the foreign substances invaiding the cytoplasma in that region or to a purely physicochemical phenomenon, the gathering at the boundering of two different colloid phases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A cDNA {{encoding}} a cytoplasmic oxysterol binding protein {{was expressed}} {{at high levels}} by transfection in animal cells. This protein binds oxysterols such as 25 -hydroxycholesterol that regulate sterol metabolism by transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects. In the transfected cells, some of the oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) was distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm, and some was bound to small vesicles near the nucleus, as revealed by indirect immunofluorescence. Upon addition of 25 -hydroxycholesterol, most of the OSBP became concentrated in large perinuclear structures that stained with lentil lectin, a protein that <b>stains</b> the Golgi <b>apparatus.</b> The structures that contained OSBP were disrupted by brefeldin A, confirming their identification as Golgi.

40|$|Fine {{structure}} of normal and activated rat parathyroids was studied using routine and glycoprotein staining. The chief {{cells of the}} gland contained organelles concerned {{with the formation of}} secretory material, that is rER and Golgi <b>apparatus.</b> In routine <b>staining,</b> the Golgi <b>apparatus</b> consisted primarily of flattened saccules and connecting profiles. The prosecretory and secretory granules associated with the connecting profiles contained a dense central core surrounded by a clear halo. With glycoprotein staining the Golgi saccules showed a gradual transition from the unstained forming face to the moderately stained mature face. In this region the connecting profiles outlined a network of hexagon-like structures. The prosecretory and secretory granules were outlined by positive material, however, their internal content was delicately stained...|$|R

40|$|Fixation of {{epidermis}} with {{a mixture}} of osmium tetroxide and zinc iodide (Os 0 4 -ZnI 2) for 24 hr renders the central periodic lamella of the Langerhans cell granule (LCG), the Golgi region, and the nuclear envelope of epidermal Langerhans cells preferentially visible. The use of this technique on Langerhans cells in normal epidermis and in epidermis of patients with histiocytosis (Letterer-Siwe disease) allows a broader visualization of the LCG's than was heretofore possible with routine glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide fixation and uranyl acetate-lead staining. The identical <b>staining</b> of Golgi <b>apparatus</b> and LCG favors the view that there is close relation between the Golgi area and the LCG's. Different staining characteristics of the LCG's near the Golgi region and at the cell periphery, respectively, may suggest that the LCG undergoes changes on its way from the Golgi area towards the extracellular space. The hypothesis is advanced that the material which is heavily impregnated with metal after fixation with Os 0 4 -ZnI 2 might be a lipid...|$|R
40|$|By {{the methods}} {{reported}} in the previous papers the anther observed the supravitally stained granules on the nucleus stained with hematoxylin. As the results it has been revealed that in lymphocytes, monocytes, myelocytic cells and Yoshida sarcoma cells, Janus green B stains mitochondria selectively but not the other components. The irregular forms of mitochondria stained with Janus green B can be recongnized frequently. This {{seems to be the}} result of the structural demolition caused by the staining itself. But in some cells the number of mitochondria which are stained by this dye, is rather small compared with those found under the phase-contrast or the electron-microscopes. Then it is assumed that Janus green B stains mitochondria selectively but not all of them. In general neutral red seems not to <b>stain</b> Golgi <b>apparatus</b> selectively, and neutral red granules are found to be irregular, both in their distribution in cytoplasma and in their size, all the granules being almost round in shape. But in small cells like monocytes, sometimes in lymphocytes the granules tend to gather in the area of Golgi zone. This thendency is recongnized especially markedly in the cells from the lower animals In the rosette formation of the neutral red Yoshida sarcoma cells have almost the same picture as that of monocytes but their mitochondria stainable with Janus green B are larger in number compared with those of monocytes. Brilliant crecyl blue and Nile blue seem also to stain mitochondria, but some other components like endoplasmic reticulum, neutrophilic granules and others in leucocytes, which can be stained by these dyes as the stained granules are very large in number and show marked variety in their sizes...|$|R
40|$|The mapping {{out of the}} histologic {{distribution}} of blood group antigens A and B in human tissues was performed {{by means of the}} fluorescent antibody technique. Human hyperimmune sera were conjugated with fluorescein isocyanate and applied to frozen sections of human material obtained at autopsy or after surgical removal. The material examined encompassed A, B, and AB subjects. In the latter the anti-A and the anti-B conjugate elicited the same picture. Group O tissues were used for controls and were uniformly negative. The secretor status of subjects was determined from the saliva or by the Lewis typing of erythrocytes. The results fall into the following main divisions: Endothelia of Vessels. —Widespread localization was demonstrated in the cell walls of endothelium of capillaries, veins, arteries, and of sinusoidal cells of spleen. Stratified Epithelia. —These showed good outlining of cells of the Malpighian (and the granular, when present) layers. In transitional epithelia, cells of the basal and contiguous layers gave specific <b>staining.</b> Mucus-Secreting <b>Apparatus.</b> —Positive <b>staining</b> was obtained in glands, goblet cells, and secreting surface epithelia. In non-secretors there was no identifiable antigen with the important exception of the deeper parts of gastric foveolae, deeper parts of crypts of Lieberkühn of bowel mucosa and Brunner's glands of the duodenum. Various Organs of Secretion and Excretion. —The pancreas (exocrine portion) and the sweat glands were found to produce the antigen irrespectively of secretor status. Breast, prostate, and endometrial glands on the other hand apparently secrete the antigen in conformity with the subject's secretor:non-secretor make-up. Thus the secretor:non-secretor status governs principally the antigens associated with mucous secretions and this in most but not all locations. The possible nature of this control is briefly discussed...|$|R

A mutant OSBP lacking the COOH-terminal oxysterol binding domain localized to the Golgi spontaneously, suggesting that this domain normally occludes the domain that binds to the Golgi and that sterols relieve this occlusion. The previously noted potential leucine zipper sequence in OSBP was not required for Golgi localization, nor was it essential for homodimer formation. We conclude that OSBP is triggered to bind extrinsically to Golgi membranes when it binds oxysterols and speculate that this translocation {{may play a role}} in the transport, metabolism, or regulatory actions of oxysterols...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{subcellular}} localization of saccharide moieties in cultured {{normal and}} malignant cells fixed in paraformaldehyde and {{treated with a}} nonionic detergent, using lectins specific for various sugar residues as probes in fluorescence microscopy.

Our results indicate that saccharide moieties in both normal and malignant cells are similarly compartmentalized, and thus speak {{in favor of a}} unidirectional subcellular flow for both membrane and secreted glycoconjugates. Several recent studies have suggested a common glycosylation pathway for both membrane and secretory glycoproteins in cells (12, 17, 18, 23). According to these studies, the core-region saccharide moieties of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, mannose and N-acetylglucosamine with some glucose residues, are linked to the newly synthetized peptide moiety during the peptide synthesis in the cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum (cf. references 18, 22, and 23). Thereafter, the glycosyl moieties are further processed in the cistemae of the Golgi apparatus, where the terminal saccharides are also included (4, 12, 23). Other glycosylation events, e. g., generation of o-glycosidically linked saccharide moieties of glycoproteins and glycosylation of glycolipids, probably take place exclusively in the Golgi apparatu...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background and purpose: According to the {{reported}} problems in {{area of the}} inappropriateness of water quality which used for washing and <b>staining</b> of car <b>apparatuses</b> in a car factory, this research was carried out for identification of physical, chemical, and microbiological characteristics of the consumed water in Babol car factory, Iran. Materials and Methods: Physical and chemical parameters of water such as total solids, total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, pH, electrical conductivity, total alkalinity, total hardness (TH), cations (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Fe 2 +, Mn 2 +, Zn 2 +), and anions (SO 42 −, Cl−, NO 3 −) were analyzed based on standard methods for examination of water and wastewater. The samples were taken from five units and were precipitated and plated on Sabouraud dextrose agar supplemented with chloramphenicol and blood agar and eosin methylene blue media. Results: TDS, turbidity, pH, TH and ammonium ion were 402 mg/L, 10 NTU, 7. 8, 208 mg/L and 0. 04 mg/L, respectively. Ten genera of fungal colonies were isolated from these units, which from them yeast Penicillium and Cladosporium were the most prevalent. Five genera of bacteria were isolated from these samples. Entrobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, and Bacillus were the most prevalent bacteria in water. Water quality in the activation and fixation units were the most contaminated with fungi and bacteria, respectively. Some of these units were without fungal and bacterial contaminations. Conclusion: The fungal and bacterial contaminations can be changed the quality of consumed water in the different processes such as color and turbidity. Thus, we need to use some wate...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that a}} fluorescent derivative of ceramide, N- (epsilon- 7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl-aminocaproyl) -D-eryth ro- sphingosin e (C 6 -NBD-Cer), vitally <b>stains</b> the Golgi <b>apparatus</b> of cells (Lipsky, N. G., and R. E. Pagano. 1985. Science (Wash. DC). 228 : 745 - 747). In the present paper we demonstrate that C 6 -NBD-Cer also accumulates at the Golgi apparatus of fixed cells and we explore the mechanism by which this occurs. When human skin fibroblasts were fixed with glutaraldehyde and then incubated with C 6 -NBD-Cer at 2 degrees C, the fluorescent lipid spontaneously transferred into the cells, labeling the Golgi apparatus {{as well as other}} intracellular membranes. Subsequent incubations with defatted BSA at 24 degrees C removed excess C 6 -NBD-Cer from the cells such that fluorescence was then detected only at the Golgi apparatus. Similar results were obtained using other cell types. A method for visualizing the fluorescent lipid at the electron microscopic level, based on the photoconversion of a fluorescent marker to a diaminobenzidine product (Sandell, J. H., and R. H. Masland, 1988. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 36 : 555 - 559), is described and evidence is presented that C 6 -NBD-Cer was localized to the trans cisternae of the Golgi apparatus. While accumulation occurred in cells fixed in various ways, it was inhibited when fixation protocols that extract or modify cellular lipids were used. In addition, Filipin, which forms complexes with cellular cholesterol, labeled the Golgi apparatus of fixed cells and inhibited accumulation of C 6 -NBD-Cer at the Golgi apparatus. These results are discussed in terms of a simple model based on the physical properties of C 6 -NBD-Cer and its interactions with endogenous lipids of the Golgi apparatus. Possible implications of these findings for metabolism and transport of (fluorescent) sphingolipids in vivo are also presented...|$|R
