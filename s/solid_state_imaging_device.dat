Introduction: CMOS <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>devices</b> have become the prevalent choice in the multi-million dollar industry of digital photography.

40|$|Three {{years ago}} LLNL {{developed}} a practical method to dramatically reduce the chromatic aberration in single element diffractive imaging lenses. High efficiency, achromatic imaging lenses have been fabricated for human vision correction. This LDRD supported research in applying our {{new methods to}} develop a unique, diffraction-based optical interface with <b>solid</b> <b>state,</b> microelectronic <b>imaging</b> <b>devices.</b> Advances in microelectronics have led to smaller, more efficient components for optical systems. There have, however, been no equivalent advances in the imaging optics associated with these devices. The goal of this project was to replace the bulky, refractive optics in typical head-mounted displays with micro-thin diffractive optics to directly image flat-panel displays into the eye. To visualize the system think of the lenses of someone`s eyeglasses becoming flat-panel displays. To realize this embodiment, we needed {{to solve the problems}} of large chromatic aberrations and low efficiency that are associated with diffraction. We have developed a graceful tradeoff between chromatic aberrations and the diffractive optic thickness. It turns out that by doubling the thickness of a micro-thin diffractive lens we obtain nearly a two-times improvement in chromatic performance. Since the human eye will tolerate one diopter of chromatic aberration, we are able to achieve an achromatic image with a diffractive lens that is only 20 microns thick, versus 3 mm thickness for the comparable refractive lens. Molds for the diffractive lenses are diamond turned with sub-micron accuracy; the final lenses are cast from these molds using various polymers. We thus retain both the micro- thin nature of the diffractive optics and the achromatic image quality of refractive optics. During the first year of funding we successfully extended our earlier technology from 1 cm diameter optics required for vision applications up to the 5 cm diameter optics required for this application. 3 refs., 6 figs...|$|R

Monochromatic photometry at 6264 ?? was performed with a 512 element linear diode array. Irradiance fluctuations were measured for the sunspots and faculae in a major solar active region during its disk transit in September, 1982. The monochromatic digital images were analyzed on the Cyber 750 mainframe computer located at California State University, Northridge. It was found that the net luminosity fluctuation due to this active region was - 27 x 10 - 6 relative to that of the quiet sun. When this luminosity fluctuation was converted into energy, it was found that an energy fluctuation of - 6 x 1034 ergs could be attributed to the solar active region. The major objective of these observations was to add to the data set of the energy balance of a solar active region during the course of its lifetime. This work is part of an ongoing effort at SFO to accomplish this endeavor. The results for September 1982 showed that the facular contribution to the energy balance of the solar active region was significant.

Both of the presented applications relate to remotely operated camera platforms, the first being the Galileo <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>imaging</b> (SSI) camera presently in orbit around Jupiter, and the second being the Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) stereo camera on Mars. A basic strategy in both applications {{is to determine the}} correct relative camera pointing followed by direct map projection of the images. It is assumed that approximate camera pointing exists sufficient to locate adjacent images and to place initial tiepoints within reach of the correlator. Spatial correlation is used to fix tiepoints whose initial locations are predicted by the camera pointing. We use either an fast fourier transform (fft) algorithm or a variant of Gruen's scheme permitting limited image rotation and skew. The Gruen correlator has three hierarchical modes: 1) A classical spatial least squares correlation on integral pixel boundaries used when rotation is small. 2) An annealing non-deterministic search used when rotations are unknown. A simplex deterministic search used for the end game. The correlation operation can be performed either interactively or autonomously. The final camera pointing solution relies upon a simplex downhill search in 2 n or 3 n dimensions where n is the number of images comprising the mosaic and the objective function to be minimized is the disagreement between tiepoint locations predicted from the camera pointing with those observed by the correlator.
