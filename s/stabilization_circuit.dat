Up to now, fully integrated off-line power supplies on chip are available for below 1 Watts, e. g. from Texas Instruments.

The integration of high-efficient power supplies based on magnetic transformers (PT) including galvanic isolation is limited due to the physics of electromagnetism. Piezoelectric transformers can be integrated when PZT material is applied on silicon to a height of several Micrometers to form an oscillating device which will be processed after micro-bonding in an etching process. Although power density of discrete PT is already high, it can be increased by a factor of 100 to 1000 in integrated devices on silicon taking advantage of uniform crystal structure of sputtering process and improved heat removal through silicon.

The system proposed in this thesis breaks through the bandwidth limitation of acousto-optic technology, yet resembles the function of an AOD since both operates as a scrolling scanner. It uses a material with large inhomogeneous bandwidth to record space-dependent time-delays as spatial spectral holograms. The recording of the spatial-spectral holograms utilizes a Galvo scanning (GS) mirror and a chirped laser. In Chapter 2, I experimentally show that a GS mirror can be sufficiently stable for the holographic recording process. After reviewing the relevant physics of the spatial-temporal holographic recording medium, the cryogenically-cooled rare earth doped crystals, in Chapter 3, I give further derivations that are useful in explaining the subsequent experimental results.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The technique whereby the frequency of an oscillator is stabilized using an external feedback network incorporating a delay-line is extended in this thesis to provide digital control of {{the frequency of the}} oscillator. Novel circuit techniques have been developed and analysed to permit the implementation of the proposed frequency control technique in a compact format, suitable for implementation in either hybrid or monolithic microwave integrated circuits. Two new microstrip circuits have been introduced, namely the three-port ring discriminator and the single PIN diode phase shifter. Frequency control of an oscillator is achieved by digitally controlling the time delay through phase shifters in the feedback path of the oscillator's <b>stabilization</b> <b>circuit.</b> A new microstrip phase shifting circuit has been developed which has the advantage of requiring only one active switching element to achieve each digital bit of phase change. The circuit has been analysed in detail and results obtained at X-band to support the theoretical predictions. As part of the analysis of this new component, and in order to permit a greater degree of precision {{in the design of the}} phase changes, some new microstrip design techniques have been introduced. These have led to a more exact design for coupled line phase shifters and to an equivalent circuit to represent the excess phase in microstrip DC breaks. Delay-line stabilization of an oscillator requires the use of a phase sensitive network, or frequency discriminator. Whilst this could be realised on microstrip using conventional circuitry, by interconnecting two hybrid rings, a new circuit component, namely the three-port ring discriminator, was developed to provide a simpler, more compact solution. A rigorous analysis of the new circuit is presented, and the behaviour verified through measurements over the frequency range 8 - 12 GHz. The new single PIN diode phase shifter has been incorporated in the delay path of a three-port ring discriminator, and used to control the frequency of an oscillator. Results are presented for circuits at X-band which show the degree of frequency stabilization that has been obtained, together with the reduction in oscillator phase noise. In addition, the original concept of delayline switching to control the frequency of an oscillator has been extended to yield a further new circuit, based on a three-port ring with a switchedfeed mechanism; results are presented which verify the operation of this new circuit both theoretically and through practical measurement. New techniques for controlling the frequency of microstrip oscillators have thus been established, both theoretically and through practical measurement, which combine simple methods of frequency selection with inherent low-noise performance...|$|E
40|$|Integrated circuit scaling {{has enabled}} a huge growth in {{processing}} capability, which necessitates a corresponding increase in inter-chip communication bandwidth. As bandwidth requirements for chip-to-chip interconnection scale, deficiencies of electrical channels become more apparent. Optical links present {{a viable alternative}} due to their low frequency-dependent loss and higher bandwidth density {{in the form of}} wavelength division multiplexing. As integrated photonics and bonding technologies are maturing, commercialization of hybrid-integrated optical links are becoming a reality. Increasing silicon integration leads to better performance in optical links but necessitates a corresponding co-design strategy in both electronics and photonics. In this light, holistic design of high-speed optical links with an in-depth understanding of photonics and state-of-the-art electronics brings their performance to unprecedented levels. This thesis presents developments in high-speed optical links by co-designing and co-integrating the primary elements of an optical link: receiver, transmitter, and clocking. In {{the first part of this}} thesis a 3 D-integrated CMOS/Silicon-photonic receiver will be presented. The electronic chip features a novel design that employs a low-bandwidth TIA front-end, double-sampling and equalization through dynamic offset modulation. Measured results show - 14. 9 dBm of sensitivity and energy efficiency of 170 fJ/b at 25 Gb/s. The same receiver front-end is also used to implement source-synchronous 4 -channel WDM-based parallel optical receiver. Quadrature ILO-based clocking is employed for synchronization and a novel frequency-tracking method that exploits the dynamics of IL in a quadrature ring oscillator to increase the effective locking range. An adaptive body-biasing circuit is designed to maintain the per-bit-energy consumption constant across wide data-rates. The prototype measurements indicate a record-low power consumption of 153 fJ/b at 32 Gb/s. The receiver sensitivity is measured to be - 8. 8 dBm at 32 Gb/s. Next, on the optical transmitter side, three new techniques will be presented. First one is a differential ring modulator that breaks the optical bandwidth/quality factor trade-off known to limit the speed of high-Q ring modulators. This structure maintains a constant energy in the ring to avoid pattern-dependent power droop. As a first proof of concept, a prototype has been fabricated and measured up to 10 Gb/s. The second technique is thermal stabilization of micro-ring resonator modulators through direct measurement of temperature using a monolithic PTAT temperature sensor. The measured temperature is used in a feedback loop to adjust the thermal tuner of the ring. A prototype is fabricated and a closed-loop feedback system is demonstrated to operate at 20 Gb/s in the presence of temperature fluctuations. The third technique is a switched-capacitor based pre-emphasis technique designed to extend the inherently low bandwidth of carrier injection micro-ring modulators. A measured prototype of the optical transmitter achieves energy efficiency of 342 fJ/bit at 10 Gb/s and the wavelength <b>stabilization</b> <b>circuit</b> based on the monolithic PTAT sensor consumes 0. 29 mW. Lastly, a first-order frequency synthesizer that is suitable for high-speed on-chip clock generation will be discussed. The proposed design features an architecture combining an LC quadrature VCO, two sample-and-holds, a PI, digital coarse-tuning, and rotational frequency detection for fine-tuning. In addition to an electrical reference clock, as an extra feature, the prototype chip is capable of receiving a low jitter optical reference clock generated by a high-repetition-rate mode-locked laser. The output clock at 8 GHz has an integrated RMS jitter of 490 fs, peak-to-peak periodic jitter of 2. 06 ps, and total RMS jitter of 680 fs.

GABA is known to {{play a crucial role}} in the construction of neuronal circuits early in postnatal development. The immature hippocampus is characterized by an early type of network activity, the so-called Giant Depolarizing Potentials (GDPs), generated by the synergistic action of glutamate and GABA, both depolarizing and excitatory. Here we tested the hypothesis that fluoxetine may interfere with GABAergic signaling during the first postnatal week, thus producing harmful effects on brain development. At micromolar concentrations fluoxetine severely depressed GDPs frequency (IC 50 22 M) in a reversible manner and independently of its action on serotonin reuptake. This effect was dependent on a reduced GABAergic (but not glutamatergic) drive to principal cells most probably from parvalbumin-positive fast spiking neurons. Cholecystokinin-positive GABAergic interneurons were not involved since the effects of the drug persisted when cannabinoid receptors were occluded with WIN 55, 212 - 2, a CB 1 /CB 2 receptor agonist. Fluoxetine effects on GABAergic transmission were associated with a reduced firing rate of both principal cells and interneurons further suggesting that changes in network excitability account for GDPs disruption. This may have critical consequences on the functional organization and <b>stabilization</b> of neuronal <b>circuits</b> early in postnatal development...|$|R
40|$|A submillimeter-wave {{monolithic}} integrated- circuit (S-MMIC) amplifier {{has been}} designed and fabricated using an indium phosphide (InP) 35 -nm gate-length high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) device, developed at Northrop Grumman Corporation. The HEMT device employs two fingers each 15 micrometers wide. The HEMT wafers are grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and make use of a pseudomorphic In 0. 75 Ga 0. 25 As channel, a silicon delta-doping layer as the electron supply, an In 0. 52 Al 0. 48 As buffer layer, and an InP substrate. The three-stage design uses coplanar waveguide topology with a very narrow ground-to-ground spacing of 14 micrometers. Quarter-wave matching transmission lines, on-chip metal-insulator-metal shunt capacitors, series thin-film resistors, and matching stubs {{were used in the}} design. Series resistors in the shunt branch arm provide the basic <b>circuit</b> <b>stabilization.</b> The S-MMIC amplifier was measured for S-parameters and found to be centered at 320 GHz with 13 - 15 -dB gain from 300 - 345 GHz. This chip was developed as part of the DARPA Submillimeter Wave Imaging Focal Plane Technology (SWIFT) program (see figure). Submillimeter-wave amplifiers could enable more sensitive receivers for earth science, planetary remote sensing, and astrophysics telescopes, particularly in radio astronomy, both from the ground and in space. A small atmospheric window at 340 GHz exists and could enable ground-based observations. However, the submillimeter-wave regime (above 300 GHz) is best used for space telescopes as Earth s atmosphere attenuates most of the signal through water and oxygen absorption. Future radio telescopes could make use of S-MMIC amplifiers for wideband, low noise, instantaneous frequency coverage, particularly in the case of heterodyne array receivers...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the effect of electrical baroreflex stimulation (BRS) at an intensity used in hypertensive patients and renal denervation (RDN) on atrial electrophysiology. BRS and RDN reduce blood pressure and global sympathetic drive in patients with resistant hypertension. Whereas RDN decreases sympathetic renal afferent nerve activity, leading to decreased central sympathetic drive, BRS modulates autonomic balance by activation of the baroreflex, resulting in both reduced sympathetic drive and increased vagal activation. Increased vagal tone potentially shortens atrial refractoriness resulting in a <b>stabilization</b> of reentry <b>circuits</b> perpetuating atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods and Results: In normotensive anesthetized pigs (n = 12), we compared the acute effect of BRS and RDN on blood pressure, atrial effective refractory period (AERP), and inducibility of AF. Electrical BRS was titrated to result in comparable heart rate and blood pressure reduction compared to irreversible RDN. BRS resulted in a rapid and pronounced shortening of AERP (from 162 ± 8 milliseconds to 117 ± 16 milliseconds, P = 0. 001) associated with increased AF-inducibility from 0 % to 82 %. This shortening in AERP was completely reversible after stopping BRS. After administration of atropine, AF-inducibility during BRS was attenuated. Ventricular repolarization was not modulated by BRS. In RDN, AF was not inducible; however, it did not prevent BRS-induced shortening of AERP. Conclusion: RDN and BRS resulting in comparable blood pressure and heart rate reductions differently influence atrial electrophysiology. Vagally mediated shortening of AERP, resulting in increased AF-inducibility, was observed with BRS but not with RDN.
