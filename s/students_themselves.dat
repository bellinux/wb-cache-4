5|$|The Castle {{is open to}} {{tourists}} only via guided tours. These occur daily outside of term time, but are more restricted during the term due to potential conflicts with {{the running of the}} college. Furthermore, events in the university timetable may result in their cancellation. Tourists are not otherwise permitted entry to the college or any common areas. There is relatively little conflict between students and tourists, with many of the guided tours done by <b>students</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{film crew}} {{recorded}} the students on campus, at home, {{with their friends}} and families, at medical appointments, and at transgender-related events. Some footage was recorded by the <b>students</b> <b>themselves.</b> In February 2005, the administration at Smith College prohibited the crew from continuing to film one of the documentary's subjects, Lucas Cheadle, on campus (except in his apartment). Cheadle asked the dean of students to reconsider, but his appeal was denied. Smith College has received considerable media attention about questions regarding transgender students.|$|E

25|$|Most first-year {{undergraduate}} students {{take a year}} of Core, an interdisciplinary course rooted in liberal arts and focused on understanding the purpose and fulfillment of human life. About a tenth of incoming freshmen alternatively participate in the freshman program of Christ College. Students are also subject to an honor system originally implemented by the <b>students</b> <b>themselves</b> in 1943, which remains in effect today. Each January, the school holds a week of Martin Luther King Jr. events as a major annual event and invites provocative keynote speakers.|$|E
25|$|The {{community}} language learning (CLL) {{is a method}} proposed by Charles A. Curran during the 1970s. It {{is based on the}} counseling approach in which the teacher is seen as a counselor. It emphasizes the sense of community in the learning group, encourages interaction as a vital aspect of learning, and it considers as a priority the students' feelings and the recognition of struggles in language acquisition. There is no syllabus or textbook to follow and it is the <b>students</b> <b>themselves</b> who determine the content of the lesson. Notably, it incorporates translation and recording techniques.|$|E

25|$|For freshmen, {{the only}} course {{requirement}} {{mandated by the}} course registrar {{is one of the}} first-year seminar courses called Introduction to Liberal Arts which are usually limited to 16 students (and never more than 18) and shares a common focus on critical analysis and development of written and oral argument. Besides a first-year seminar course, the other 31 courses (usually four are taken per semester) required for graduation can be elected by the <b>students</b> <b>themselves.</b> Nevertheless, to complete their major, students must still adhere to departmental course requirements.|$|E
25|$|All clubs, fests and {{activities}} are {{managed by the}} <b>students</b> <b>themselves</b> with little outside help. Students elect a body for administration, the Students' Union (SU). The SU is elected during the fall semester {{in the month of}} September and is responsible for the set-up of the departments directly influencing fests, i.e. the departments of sponsorship and marketing, publicity, security and hospitality, etc. In addition to the SU, students also elect members for the Students' Mess Council (SMC), which is in charge of managing the two messes and the all-night canteen. Both these student bodies co-ordinate with the Students' Welfare Division (SWD) branch of the administration. These elections are also used for the election of students to other posts, i.e. Sports' Secretary, Hostel Representatives, etc.|$|E
25|$|On 27 November 2013, the occupying {{students}} filmed two professors from Sofia University {{who were}} celebrating a birthday and the conferral of a professorship while drinking alcohol {{on the premises}} of the university (outside working hours). While some commentators were critical of the academics for setting a bad example and possibly violating university policies, others condemned the students for going overboard in their desire to pontificate about morality and for supposedly being motivated by revanchism (because the two professors had publicly opposed the occupation). Ivaylo Dinev, {{one of the leading}} figures behind the first occupation, later regretted the decision to make the clip available to the general public, calling it a strategic and moral mistake, as it shifted the focus of the wider society on a relatively unimportant issue, caused the student protesters to lose some outside support, and created friction within the ranks of the occupying <b>students</b> <b>themselves.</b> He also acknowledged that drinking alcohol (by both students and academics) during special occasions had always been regarded as being compatible with the ethos of the university.|$|E

25|$|The {{option of}} {{completing}} a work term abroad {{is also a}} possibility through the University of Ottawa’s co-op program. Although {{there may not be}} as many job opportunities abroad directly presented, the opportunity still remains. However, most of the work terms abroad are discovered by <b>students</b> <b>themselves,</b> outside the co-op program. Typically, the requirements remain the same as for the co-op program itself. In certain cases, additional features may be considered. If one is considering working abroad there are information sessions held to further inform students at the University of Ottawa on work term abroad possibilities. The sessions outline what students should expect, various costs of living abroad, and the challenges they may come across. Furthermore, if a student chooses to pursue a work term abroad, the University of Ottawa’s co-op program offers further assistance right up to the departure date in order to ensure student success. Services offered may include meeting with a professional development specialist in order to compose a job-finding strategy, learn various success strategies, and work towards having everything ready before the departure date. In addition, training can be offered to help prepare students with an idea of what to expect, necessary documents, and further information on the work they will be completing and the country students may be traveling to.|$|E
500|$|Whitehead's {{philosophy}} of education might adequately be summarized {{in his statement}} that [...] "knowledge does not keep any better than fish." [...] In other words, bits of disconnected knowledge are meaningless; all knowledge must find some imaginative application to the students' own lives, or else it becomes so much useless trivia, and the <b>students</b> <b>themselves</b> become good at parroting facts but not thinking for themselves.|$|E

The show chronicled the lives of five real SCPA {{high school students and}} their friends in their careers at SCPA. Each episode featured original music and choreography by the <b>students</b> <b>themselves,</b> performed at the school and other locations in Over-the-Rhine.|$|E
50|$|Some {{students}} may give {{all of the}} other students very high grades which will cause their score to be lower compared to the others.

500|$|Undergraduates are {{guaranteed}} four-year housing {{in one of}} MIT's 12 undergraduate dormitories. Those living on campus can receive support and mentoring from live-in graduate student tutors, resident advisors, and faculty housemasters. Because housing assignments are made based on the preferences of the <b>students</b> <b>themselves,</b> diverse social atmospheres can be sustained in different living groups; for example, according to the Yale Daily News staff's The Insider's Guide to the Colleges, 2010, [...] "The split between East Campus and West Campus is a significant characteristic of MIT. East Campus has gained {{a reputation as a}} thriving counterculture." [...] MIT also has 5 dormitories for single graduate students and 2 apartment buildings on campus for married student families.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s onwards, {{there was}} a certain progressiveness in the air, and the first women guests were {{admitted}} in 1964. Women members were first admitted to the 1974–5 year. The college's first comprehensive-schooled student (Paul Barker) had arrived in 1955. It was also almost completely secular– {{with the exception of the}} chaplain and his deputies; the chaplain's role itself dominated by pastoral work. The <b>students</b> <b>themselves</b> concentrated more and more on the exams– marks improved across the university– but this left a class gulf between some staff and undergraduates, most visible in [...] "gentlemanly" [...] sports. Michael Palin and Robert Hewison were among new creative talent. Since the 1950s, over 70% of students were state-assisted, half of undergraduates drawn from state or direct grant schools, a figure very close to the University average. Brasenose merged [...] entrance and scholarship exams in 1961, abolished closed scholarships in the decade after, and open entrance awards in 1984. Brasenose's traditional link with the north-west also floundered, although it is perhaps surprising that it lasted until the 1970s. In its place, there were more entrants, paying higher fees, from elsewhere in the world.|$|E
500|$|Barbauld and {{her husband}} spent eleven years {{teaching}} at Palgrave Academy in Suffolk. Early on, Barbauld was not only responsible for running her own household, but also the school's—she was accountant, maid, and housekeeper. The school opened with only eight boys, but when the Barbaulds left in 1785, approximately forty were enrolled, {{a testament to the}} excellent reputation the school had acquired. The Barbaulds' educational philosophy attracted Dissenters as well as Anglicans. Palgrave replaced the strict discipline of traditional schools such as Eton, which often used corporal punishment, with a system of [...] "fines and jobations" [...] and even, it seems likely, [...] "juvenile trials," [...] that is, trials run by and for the <b>students</b> <b>themselves.</b> Moreover, instead of the traditional classical studies, the school offered a practical curriculum that stressed science and the modern languages. Barbauld herself taught the foundational subjects of reading and religion to the youngest boys and geography, history, composition and rhetoric, and science to higher grade levels. She was a dedicated teacher, producing a [...] "weekly chronicle" [...] for the school and writing theatrical pieces for the students to perform. Barbauld {{had a profound effect on}} many of her students; one who went on to great success, William Taylor, a preeminent scholar of German literature, referred to Barbauld as [...] "the mother of his mind." ...|$|E
