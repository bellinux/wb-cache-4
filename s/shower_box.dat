5000|$|The {{area around}} present-day Avon was {{known by the}} Seneca as [...] "Canawaugus," [...] or [...] "the place of stinking waters" [...] due to the {{prevalence}} of sulfur in the springs {{on the west side}} of town. The Seneca believed the water's mineral characteristics had health benefits long before the white settlers arrived. In 1821, Richard Wadsworth was the first white man in Avon to build a <b>showering</b> <b>box</b> and promote the curative properties of the sulfur water. The reputation of Avon Springs grew throughout the 19th century, peaking just before the Civil War era. Guests sought health cures as well as relaxation and recreation opportunities in the Genesee Valley. By about 1900, most of the numerous hotels and spas were gone.|$|R
50|$|Box {{patterns}} are juggling patterns that combine vertical, columns-like throws with horizontal throws, {{such as in}} the <b>shower</b> pattern. <b>Box</b> {{patterns are}} so named due to the props in the pattern apparently tracing several sides of a box in the air, and can be performed with any number of props {{greater than or equal to}} two, synchronously (see right) or asynchronously (e.g. 612).|$|R
50|$|The Central Catholic Boosters (parents of CCHS students) {{volunteered to}} {{maintain}} the complex. The stadium consisted of a grass football field, a cinder track, home and visitor locker rooms (with <b>showers),</b> a press <b>box,</b> a fully functioning concession stand, a practice field and adequate parking.|$|R
25|$|Water {{conservation}} measures, such as {{awareness campaigns}} {{through the media}} and educational pamphlets, have been carried out. In addition, in Riyadh a leakage control program {{has been carried out}} and a special, higher water tariff has been introduced. Furthermore, free water appliances (taps, <b>shower</b> heads, toilet <b>boxes)</b> were distributed, reportedly resulting in a decrease of residential water use of between 25-35%.|$|R

50|$|For 2008, Electric Picnic {{introduced}} the Myhab eco-friendly alternative to camping. Ticket holders could book a two-person myhab, which {{was located in}} the yellow campsite. When {{they arrived at the}} site, the myhabs were waiting for you. Myhab users also had access to toilets, hot <b>showers,</b> a safe <b>box</b> for valuables, and it was easy to find as it could be personalised when booked online. Myhabs were waterproof, spacious, and made from reusable, recyclable materials.|$|R
5000|$|Cairns Field {{features}} artificial lighting, electronic scoreboard, irrigated and groomed grass infield, excellent drainage, an 8 foot outfield {{fence with}} wind screening and dimensions of 335 feet down each line and 400 feet in center field. The supporting facilities {{at the field}} include stands seating in excess of 5,000 fans, a clubhouse with four dressing rooms, concession, washrooms, <b>showers,</b> media press <b>box</b> with a public address system, an umpires' room, warm-up mounds and a permanent batting cage. The ballpark hosted for the 2005 Canadian National Junior Championships.|$|R
50|$|Mills Mess is a shape {{distortion}} involving {{crossing and}} uncrossing arm movement, which {{is independent of}} the siteswap being performed. Any siteswap with any number of objects can, in theory, be done in Mills Mess. It is merely a distortion of the pattern's shape. The standard Mills Mess has the siteswap 3, but Mills Messes of 441, 531 (tower), 534 (four props) and many others have also been performed. The three ball 51 (the <b>shower),</b> , 414 (half <b>box),</b> 315, and 612 (see-saw), {{as well as the}} four prop 4 (columns or fountain), 534, 552, and the five prop cascade, 5, may have the Mills Mess shape distortion imposed upon them with varying degrees of difficulty.|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of my thesis {{represents}} {{a contribution to the}} program of the research group of the School of Science and Technology, Chemistry Division, of the University of Camerino, which has for a long time been studying the cerium chemistry and has dedicated itself particularly to the study of new methodologies involving the use of system CeCl 3 · 7 H 2 O with NaI. In many trials, good results have been achieved and the procedures developed are characterized not only by the efficiency of the reactions, but also by chemoselective processes, by a good stereochemical control, by reacting available and inexpensive reagents and, in some cases, from the possibility of recovering the catalytic promoter system used through simple procedures of work-up. One of the objectives of the modern organic synthesis concerns the substitution of chemical processes that use substances dangerous for the environment with eco-friendly methodologies. The system CeCl 3 · 7 H 2 O-NaI is inexpensive, non-toxic, very stable when exposed to water and air, it is able to work under solvent-free conditions and it can be recycled. This means that it is an excellent catalyst in various reactions, contributing in this way to the development of green chemistry, in response to the problem of environmental pollution caused by the difficulty eliminating of the organic solvents. This also means the development of new strategies for the synthesis of natural substances and unnatural with important biological activities, it represents a field of remarkable interest and in continuing development in organic chemistry. This work will be described in the chapters 1 to 3. The second part of my academic program was developed at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany, described in chapter 4. The work was carried out in collaboration with Delta s. r. l, producers of kitchen sinks and rose from the market demand of selfcleaning surfaces using nanosized titanium dioxide. Following the pathway of heterogeneous catalysis, the research has been focused on realizing an additive made of PMMA nanoparticles functionalized with TiO 2. The third part of my work is in collaboration between the University of Camerino and Teuco Guzzini s. p. a. and is described in chapters 5 and 6. Teuco {{is one of the most}} important producers for sanitary ware, especially tubs, wash basins, <b>shower</b> trays and <b>boxes,</b> in constant research for innovative materials and design, better performance and quality. The collaboration between University and Teuco was born from the demand for the application of chemical research to the development of innovative materials. The work describes the development of an important project, the Cold Cure project, which concerns a process of polymerization conducted at room pressure and temperature and applied in particular to the production of shower trays, but could equally be used for the production of other articles, such as washbasins, sinks, work-tops, ect. The targets of my work are resumed in the following points: · Technological improvement of the productive process to reduce production time and costs. · Improvement of the esthetical properties to remove the white spots affecting the cured material. · Improvement of the cold curing system to obtain better mechanical and chemical properties. In Teuco, I had the opportunity to follow the steps of preparation of the dispersions, to complete the rheological study of slurries, to perform the mechanical characterization of the products obtained and to develop the productive processes using specific instruments and machines. The lab instruments included a viscometer for the rheological analysis of the material, a Rockwell durometer, a Barcol durometer, a Charpy pendulum and a flexural and tensile dynamometer. The characterization of the moulded articles was also carried out from a chemical point of view, by the determination of the residual monomer, an important parameter to explore the complete reaction of polymerization using an analytical method developed in the School of Science and Technology, Chemistry Division, of the University of Camerino. Furthermore, for the elimination of some defects present on the surface of the shower trays obtained through the cold cure technology, the use of SEM microscopy was particularly useful. The industrial machines used include: injection moulding machines, multi-component dosing, mixing and casting machines. Working in the laboratory R&D Teuco also allowed me to carry out the study keeping in mind the commercial demands, for which the results must be each time compatible with the management of time and business costs.
