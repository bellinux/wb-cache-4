50|$|Maria Pauer was a maid in the St. Catherine suburb in Mühldorf. In January 1749, <b>she</b> had <b>run</b> <b>an</b> <b>errand</b> for her {{employer}} to another house, and afterwards, {{the house was}} tormented by poltergeist phenomena. This led to her arrest. The conditions in prison made her apathetic and weak. She was interrogated with 527 questions in two months. Anna Maria Zötlin and Liesel Gusterer were also arrested and executed in 1749. Torture was used, and in September 1750, she confessed her guilt. She {{was sentenced to death}} and decapitated and burned on October 6, 1750.|$|R
50|$|After Rosalba leaves, Arlequin arrives. Argentine tells Arlequin that <b>she</b> {{needs to}} <b>run</b> <b>an</b> <b>errand</b> for Rosalba {{but does not}} explain herself because she promised Rosalba that she would tell no one, even Arlequin. While Argentine is gone, Mezzetin arrives with a letter from Lélio to Rosalba, {{but as part of}} the secret, he has written Argentine's name on the outside. Mezzetin {{mistakes}} Arlequin for Argentine's servant and tells him that he thinks Lélio is having an affair with her. Arlequin reads the letter and assumes that Argentine is cheating on him. He confronts her when she returns to the house, but she refuses to tell Arlequin what she was doing and asks him instead to trust her. He leaves to tell Rosalba's father that Argentine was having an affair.|$|R
40|$|Mild {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) {{is the middle}} ground between normal, age-appropriate memory impairment, and dementia. Whereas patients with MCI are {{able to cope with}} the memory deficit, those with dementia are not: Their memory impairment and other cognitive deficits are of sufficient magnitude to interfere with the patients’ ability to cope independently with daily activities. In both MCI and dementia, there is evidence of declining cognitive functions from a previously higher level of functioning. In both the conditions, there is also an evidence of dysfunction in one or more cognitive domains. There are two subtypes of MCI depending on whether memory is predominantly affected: amnestic type and nonamnestic/behavioral type. Not all patients with MCI transition to dementia, some recover. In this case scenario, we present a 68 -year-old man with MCI who lives with his wife. They are getting ready to host dinner. His wife asks him to vacuum the dining room while <b>she</b> <b>runs</b> <b>an</b> urgent <b>errand.</b> We describe how this simple task vacuuming a room ended in a catastrophe with the patient spending the night in jail and his wife hospitalized. We discuss what went wrong in the patient/wife interaction and how the catastrophic ending could have been avoided. Objectives At the end of this case discussion readers will know the following: The differences between mild {{cognitive impairment}} (MCI), normal aging, and dementia. MCI is often a precursor of dementia and has an amnestic or nonamnestic/behavioral presentation. However, not all patients with MCI develop dementia, some even recover. MCI is an opportunity to discuss with the patient various issues that may arise, should it progress to dementia such as preparing a will, transitioning from driver to passenger, and addressing various financial and legal issues including end-of-life issues and selecting someone to have power of attorney. Patients with MCI should be regularly followed up to determine whether and when they will transition to dementia as this changes the level of care needed. Patients with MCI are at an increased risk of triggering accidents because of their cognitive impairment and often impaired judgment. It may be hazardous to leave patients with MCI alone, without supervision. The importance of support groups, social media, and cameras when providing care to patients with MCI and dementias...|$|R

Of course I consented and, taking the medicine, I hurried away. It was a long distance, mostly up hill, and my legs began to grow weary. Without thinking what I was doing I said aloud: 'Dear me; I wish I had twenty legs!' and in an instant I became the unusual creature you see beside you. Twenty legs! Twenty on one man! You may count them, if you doubt my word." ...|$|R
