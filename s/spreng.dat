5|$|This fern was {{at first}} {{identified}} by André Michaux, in 1803, as black spleenwort (Asplenium adiantum-nigrum). Carl Ludwig Willdenow recognized and {{described it as a}} separate species, which he named Asplenium montanum, in 1810. In 1901, John A. Shafer attempted to transfer it to the genus Athyrium as Athyrium montanum, but this name is illegitimate as a later homonym of Athyrium montanum (Lam.) Röhl. ex <b>Spreng.</b> The species was segregated from Asplenium as Chamaefilix montana by Oliver Atkins Farwell in 1931. The change was not widely accepted and current authorities do not recognize this segregate genus. In 1974, Timothy Reeves described an unusual population of A.montanum from the Shawangunk Mountains. Having used chromatography to show {{that it was not a}} hybrid, he interpreted it as a new form, Asplenium montanum forma shawangunkense. In this form, as contrasted with the usual forma montanum, the leaf blade is yellow-green, the fronds continue highly dissected to the apex and do not come to a pointed tip, the fronds are shorter and more highly dissected than usual, and all fronds are sterile.|$|E

25|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} that {{are high in}} lycopene include autumn olive, gac, tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruit, pink guava, papaya, seabuckthorn, wolfberry (goji, a berry relative of tomato), and rosehip. Ketchup is a common dietary source of lycopene. Although gac (Momordica cochinchinensis <b>Spreng)</b> has the highest content of lycopene of any known fruit or vegetable (multiple times more than tomatoes), tomatoes and tomato-based sauces, juices, and ketchup {{account for more than}} 85% of the dietary intake of lycopene for most people. The lycopene content of tomatoes depends on species and increases as the fruit ripens.|$|E
500|$|Robert Brown {{described}} 31 {{species of}} Banksia in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen, including six taxa (B.marginata α and β plus four further species) now attributable to B.marginata. He split the genus into two subgenera, placing these species in subgenus Banksia verae, the [...] "True Banksias". He described Banksia australis R.Br., giving {{the location of}} the collection as Port Phillip Bay in Victoria in 1802 (having crossed out Van Diemen's Land 1804). Brown's other collections which were reduced to synonymy with [...] B.marginata were Banksia depressa R.Br., a prostrate shrub from Margate Rivulet in southeastern Tasmania, Banksia insularis R.Br., from Flinders and King Island, and Banksia patula R.Br., a shrub from the vicinity of Port Lincoln, South Australia. The French naturalist Aimé Bonpland in 1816 called it Banksia marcescens Bonpl., deemed an illegitimate name, as by that time the name Banksia marginata already had been published. Still more synonyms are Banksia ferrea Vent. ex <b>Spreng.</b> and Banksia gunnii Meisn.|$|E

He dedicated his dissertation as an uxori carissimae sacrum, Latin for (roughly) [...] "a gift of devotion to a wife most dear"namely, Lili (née Beer), a painter from Hungary whom he had married earlier in 1913.
