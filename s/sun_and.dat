5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 36% {{greater than that of}} the <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> it is 90% more luminous. The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of the <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> is therefore described as metal-rich. Mu Arae is also more enriched than the Sun in the element helium.|$|E

5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E

5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is {{much less}} massive than the Sun: {{estimates}} suggest it has only 32% {{of the mass of}} the Sun.

These factors combine to make the star only 1.24% as luminous as the <b>Sun,</b> <b>and</b> most of this is at infrared wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|Earth is {{the third}} planet from the <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago.

Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.|$|E

5|$|Flower, <b>Sun,</b> <b>and</b> Rain was {{developed}} by Grasshopper Manufacture. The game was conceived by studio founder Goichi Suda, beginning development in 1999 after completion of the studio's debut title The Silver Case. The staff number for The Silver Case was under ten people and thus they had to adjust their development goals based on that. For Flower, <b>Sun,</b> <b>and</b> Rain five or six more people were involved and thus the scope was increased, such as including exploration and action elements. According to Suda, Flower, <b>Sun,</b> <b>and</b> Rain {{was part of the}} studio's transition towards more action-oriented titles. While The Silver Case was published on the original PlayStation, that console was nearing the end of its viable life cycle, so Flower, <b>Sun,</b> <b>and</b> Rain {{was developed}} for the PlayStation 2 (PS2). Flower, <b>Sun,</b> <b>and</b> Rain moved away from the purely text-driven structure of The Silver Case, but it still carried over many of the previous game's themes and concepts. As with The Silver Case, Suda wanted to include puzzles, but felt that he had gone too far with the variety and challenge of puzzles within The Silver Case. Instead, Suda created a single puzzle system revolving around numerical combinations, which both simplified puzzles and tied in with Mondo's character.|$|E
