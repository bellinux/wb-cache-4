40|$|There {{are several}} {{international}} and European legal instruments which provide a legal {{basis for the}} establishments of marine protected areas (MPAs) {{for the purpose of}} improving fishery management in the marine environment. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of MPAs remains open to debate and considerable attention is now focussed at international and European levels on how to improve the enforcement of regulations in MPAs. In this context, there is little doubt but that monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) are indispensable tools for improving law enforcement and compliance in such areas. Indeed, recent experience in the European Union suggests that the effectiveness of MCS ought to be a primary consideration when designated areas to be protected in the marine environment. Accordingly, the aim {{of this article is to}} focus on some of the difficulties that must be overcome in order to improve the effectiveness of MCS in MPAs. Particular emphasis is placed on the problems that stem from the absence of common definitions regarding the characteristics of the area to be protected, the absence of harmonisation of MCS in such areas, as well as the problems that stem from practical considerations such as the size, shape and location of MPAs. The article also reviews basic fishery enforcement measures which can improve the effectiveness of MPAs including: hydrofencing, <b>special</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>permits,</b> one gear rule, as well as specific monitoring systems and security enforcement zones. Although the total harmonisation of regulatory measures is desirable from a law enforcement perspective, the article nonetheless concludes that it is also possible to have specific MCS solutions tailored to meet the characteristics of the area that needs to be protected...|$|E
40|$|There {{is intense}} fishing activity, mainly artisanal, in the Cananéia, Iguape and Ilha Comprida Estuarine System. White mullet (Mugil curema) {{is one of}} the local fishery {{resources}} and is usually caught with gillnets and fish traps. This study aimed to characterise the Mugil curema fisheries thereby underpinning the management of the species in the region. The study was developed with data collected from landings in the town of Cananéia, São Paulo state, Brazil, from 1995 to 2009. Production data, fishing effort and CPUE were used to assess the evolution of captures. The gillnets were characterised by interviewing fishermen from 16 communities in Cananéia. White mullet fishery has aroused the interest of fishermen in the region since the 80 s and today it {{is one of the}} main products of artisanal estuarine fishery off the south coast of São Paulo. The major landings occur in the warmer months with fish traps and gillnets being the main fishing gear used. The largest catches occur in the spawning months of the species from October to April. The highest landings varied according to different fishing gear, showing differences primarily due to trade preferences and to the structure of the fishing gear. According to the index of abundance used in this study, the resource is overfished due to the progressive increase in fishing effort, so it is suggested that measures should be taken to control fishing effort, such as <b>special</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>permits</b> to catch white mullet, especially with gillnets. The current management measures neither meet the needs of fishermen nor the preservation of the resource, and must be reviewed in a participatory way wit...|$|E
