5|$|In December 2015, the Joint Working Party of {{international}} scientific bodies International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) recognized the element's discovery and assigned {{the priority of}} the discovery to the Dubna–Livermore collaboration. This was on account of two 2009 and 2010 confirmations of {{the properties of the}} granddaughter of 294Og, 286Fl, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as well as the observation of another consistent decay chain of 294Og by the Dubna group in 2012. The goal of that experiment had been the synthesis of 294Ts via the reaction 249Bk(48Ca,3n), but the short half-life of 249Bk resulted in a <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> of the target having decayed to 249Cf, resulting in the synthesis of oganesson instead of tennessine.|$|E
5|$|The Dubna team {{repeated}} the experiment in 2012, creating seven atoms of element 117 and confirming their earlier synthesis of element 118 (produced {{after some time}} when a <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> of the berkelium-249 target had beta decayed to californium-249). The results of the experiment matched the previous outcome; the scientists then filed an application to register the element. In May 2014, a joint German–American collaboration of scientists from the ORNL and the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany, claimed to have confirmed discovery of the element. The team {{repeated the}} Dubna experiment using the Darmstadt accelerator, creating two atoms of element 117.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} {{ships were}} both purchased into the Royal Navy and recommissioned, Renommée becoming HMS Java and Néréide becoming HMS Madagascar. Nearly four decades later {{the battle was}} among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. The action {{marked the end of}} the final French attempt to operate in the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars: with their bases now in British hands, any deployment to the region would require a <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> of ships and supplies at a time when France was unable to even protect the entrances to her principal harbours, as Clorindes brush with Tonnant had demonstrated. The action also ended the threat to British merchant ships, especially the large East Indiamen, from attack in the Indian Ocean and the requirement for a significant Royal Navy presence in the region. With {{the exception of a few}} small Dutch ports in the East Indies, the world east of the Cape of Good Hope was now either under British control or in the hands of neutral powers and Britain's allies.|$|E

5|$|Fieldwork in 1996 {{turned up}} a spectacularly {{complete}} theropod skull preserved in exquisite detail (FMNH PR 2100). On top of this skull was a dome-shaped swelling nearly {{identical to the one}} described by Sues and Taquet as Majungatholus atopus. Majungatholus was redescribed as an abelisaurid rather than a pachycephalosaur in 1998. Although the name Majungasaurus crenatissimus was older than Majungatholus atopus, the authors judged the type dentary of Majungasaurus too fragmentary to confidently assign to the same species as the skull. Further fieldwork over the next decade {{turned up a}} series of less complete skulls, as well as dozens of partial skeletons of individuals ranging from juveniles to adults. Project members also collected hundreds of isolated bones and thousands of shed Majungasaurus teeth. Taken together, these remains represent nearly all the bones of the skeleton, although most of the forelimbs, most of the pelvis and the tip of the tail are still unknown. This fieldwork culminated in a 2007 monograph consisting of seven scientific papers on all aspects of the animal's biology, published in the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Memoirs. The papers are in English, although each has an abstract written in Malagasy. In this volume, the dentary described by Lavocat was re-evaluated and determined to be diagnostic for this species. Therefore, the name Majungatholus was replaced by the older name Majungasaurus. Although the monograph is comprehensive, the editors noted that it describes only material recovered from 1993 through 2001. A <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> of specimens, some very complete, were excavated in 2003 and 2005 and await preparation and description in future publications. The dentary was made the neotype specimen after a 2009 petition to the ICZN.|$|E

25|$|A <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> {{of natural}} {{benzaldehyde}} is produced from cinnamaldehyde obtained from cassia oil by the retro-aldol reaction: the cinnamaldehyde is refluxed in an aqueous/alcoholic solution between 90°C and 150°C with a base (most commonly sodium carbonate or bicarbonate) for 5 to 80 hours, followed by distillation of the formed benzaldehyde. This reaction also yields acetaldehyde. The natural status of benzaldehyde obtained {{in this way}} is controversial.|$|E

Once diamonds {{are removed from}} the ore and acid washed, they are sorted and shipped to Perth for further sorting and sale. A <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> of diamonds are cut in India, where low costs of labour allow small diamonds to be cut for a profit; this is especially relevant to the Argyle mine, which on average produces smaller rough diamonds than other mines do.|$|E

25|$|It {{is certain}} that Shang-lineage writing {{underwent}} a period of development before the Anyang oracle bone script, because of its mature nature. However, no <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> of clearly identifiable writing from before or during the early to middle Shang cultural period has been discovered. The few Neolithic symbols found on pottery, jade, or bone {{at a variety of}} cultural sites in China are very controversial, and there is no consensus that any of them are directly related to the Shang oracle bone script.|$|E
25|$|Several {{forms of}} {{laboratory}} testing for Lyme disease are available, {{some of which}} have not been adequately validated. The most widely used tests are serologies, which measure levels of specific antibodies in a patient's blood. These tests may be negative in early infection as the body may not have produced a <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> of antibodies, but they are considered a reliable aid in the diagnosis of later stages of Lyme disease. Serologic tests for Lyme disease are of limited use in people lacking objective signs of Lyme disease because of false positive results and cost.|$|E
25|$|Whilst the Type 100 {{proved to}} be an {{effective}} and reliable weapon in close quarter fighting, perceived lack of requirement for SMGs and Japan's poor industrial capacity meant that only around 27,000 were ever produced. As a result of this, when the weapon was issued to regular combat units only officers and some NCOs received it; the Type 100 was never a common battlefield weapon. Special forces units are known to have been prioritized for reception of the weapon {{due to the nature of}} their operations; however, some American service personnel did report encountering the weapon in the Pacific Islands late in the war. Additionally, no Japanese soldier was ever equipped with the weapon until late 1941, and it was not produced in any <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> until 1943 — a point at which the manufacturing quality of Japanese weapons had already begun to deteriorate.|$|E

25|$|Taking {{place in}} 2017, {{all the major}} characters, besides Craig, have left the Parks Department, and Ron and Leslie are shown to be enemies due to Ron's company having torn down Ann's old house {{in order to build}} an {{apartment}} building. Ben convinces a technology company, Gryzzl, to bring free Wi-Fi to the city of Pawnee by beating them at a board game he had invented, The Cones of Dunshire. Gryzzl engages in intense data mining, inducing Ron, whose new construction company Very Good Building and Development Company, has been handling their construction needs, to reconnect with Leslie to correct the issue. After he and Leslie resolve their differences, Ron and Leslie convince Gryzzl to change its ways, and the firm becomes a positive influence in Pawnee, building its headquarters in a previously run-down part of town and eventually donating a <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> of land, which Leslie turns into a national park. Tom hires his old girlfriend Lucy as manager of his restaurant. Eventually he proposes, and she accepts. He later experiences financial ruin, but finds success again by publishing a best selling book on his failure. Donna marries, moves to Seattle, and becomes a successful real estate agent, which supplements the income from the financially strained school district where her husband Joe works.|$|E
500|$|In a 1998 study, the {{carotenoid}} {{composition of}} this species was compared to several other Cantharellus species, including C.cibarus, C.cibarius var. amythysteus, and C.tabernensis. The carotenoid content between species was [...] "virtually identical", comprising γ-carotene, α-carotene, and β-carotene. The only significant difference was that C.lateritius contained a <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> of an unidentified carotene that {{was thought to be}} a breakdown product of β-carotene.|$|E
500|$|From Earth-based {{radar and}} {{spacecraft}} {{images of the}} crater edge, Shackleton appears to be relatively intact; much like a young crater {{that has not been}} significantly eroded from subsequent impacts. This may mean that the inner sides are relatively steep, which may make traversing the sides relatively difficult for a robotic vehicle. In addition, {{it is possible that the}} interior floor might not have collected a <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> of [...] since its formation.

500|$|Both Reynolds and McGilvray {{place the}} Polish losses on the Maczuga at 351 killed and wounded and 11 tanks lost, {{although}} Jarymowycz gives higher figures of 325 killed, 1,002 wounded, and 114 missing—approximately 20% of the division's combat strength. For the entire operation {{to close the}} Falaise pocket, Copp quotes from the 1st Polish Armoured Division's operational report, citing 1,441 casualties including 466 killed in action. McGilvray estimates the German losses in their assaults on the ridge as around 500 dead with a further 1,000 taken prisoner, most of these from the 12th SS Panzer Division. He also records [...] "scores" [...] of Tiger, Panther and Panzer IV tanks destroyed, {{as well as a}} <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> of artillery pieces.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the early}} 1980s Middlewich {{has seen a}} <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> of new housing development, {{initially}} in the Sutton Lane and Hayhurst Avenue areas. New developments have recently been built on the sites of old salt workings {{to the south of}} the Roman Fort at Harbutt's Field, near the Norman Baron's moated manor house at Kinderton Manor, and {{on the site of the}} old railway station. [...] One of the latest developments is on the old silk works next to the Big Lock public house. In common with other local towns such as Holmes Chapel, Northwich and Winsford, people are attracted to Middlewich because of its good road links via the M6 motorway and the relatively low price and availability of suitable building land.|$|E
500|$|Even at such long odds, {{the danger}} was {{sufficiently}} {{great to be}} taken seriously. Thomson, at Imperial College London, and Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist at the University of Birmingham, were tasked with carrying {{out a series of}} experiments on uranium. By February 1940, Thomson's team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium, and he had decided that it was not worth pursuing. But at Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a strikingly different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on the University's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. They calculated the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235, the only fissile isotope found in <b>significant</b> <b>quantity</b> in nature, and found that instead of tons, as everyone had assumed, as little as [...] would suffice, which would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite.|$|E
