25|$|The {{artisans}} {{with the}} highest social status were those who worked with metals and feathers, {{as well as those}} who worked with <b>semi</b> <b>precious</b> stones. The reason for this was that these artisan produced goods used by the ruling classes as well as offerings to the gods. Michoacán was one of Mesoamerica’s major metal working centers, mastering hammering, metal coating and metal casting by the time the Spanish arrived. Most metal work was in gold, but the Purépecha had developed some copper work. Most of the products were ornaments for the ruling classes but some utilitarian items such as needles, fishhooks and hole punches were made. Luxury goods made with fine feathers was a particularly appreciated by Purépecha society. Goods such as caps, blankets, clothing, headdresses and ornamental staffs adorned with feathers were used only by priests and rulers as symbols of power and dignity. Artisans who made these objects had their own designation, “izquarecucha.” Purépecha stone work includes the working of turquoise and other <b>semi</b> <b>precious</b> stones along with obsidian. Most were used in adornments and offerings but obsidian was also used for agricultural tools of high economic value, weapons and sacrificial knives. Stoneworkers’ graves can be identified by their goods, which included their tools and raw materials.|$|E

However, this activity has not been good growth begin at terms of processing until its quality determining. Lapidary include cutting, grinding and polishing is done using different tools, thus requiring expensive equipment procurement costs. From the stages of processing, the type of piece that is often found in Indonesia is a dome shape or cabochon. The design of the tools {{that may be used}} for use in small scale / household is a multifunctional tool. Tool that can be used as of cutting up to polishing. Then tested whether the tool can be used for precious stones workmanship and quality such as what can produce from the use of designed tool. By using photograph techniques and paint.

This grade is within the range for the best quality of precious stones. So that the tool can be used to workmanship of precious stones and also discovered a method of determining the quality of precious stone. In the testing phase, the tools used for working lumuik and limau manih stone, green and orange color is produced within the range of value 80 - 50, which is the best value for the workmanship of precious stone. Thus, the designed tool has been able to achieve a surface roughness that is suitable for precious stone, the best color can be produced and the productivity can be improved from the use of time by using a variety of tools. In terms use of processing time, the tool can be used to work on a relatively short when compared to conventional workmanship. Keywords : Lapidary, Color, Value, Surface Roughness, Productivit...|$|R
40|$|Universities are {{relied on}} for education, {{training}} and manpower development and research for socio-economic development of any nation. For Universities {{to meet up}} with the onerous responsibility, they need to provide strong literature support to the teaching, learning, research and community development activities. The unit of the university responsible for the provision, management and dissemination of information to support the effective and expeditious attainment of the objectives of the university is its library. It is pertinent to state that the increase in the volume of literature in the library collection has been occurring at an exponential rate in this information age century. Nevertheless, many University Libraries globally are beset with dearth of information resources especially in the professions and local content. This {{is due to the fact}} that in the field of librarianship and information science generally, there has been an out cry for literatures in quest of people utilitarian. While relief has come to some of the libraries through computerization and internet connectivity, there is still the pressing need to more effectively manage Grey Literature for higher education and research as they are often not accessible on the web. Grey literature(GL) is from a broader term ephemera which is defined as a collective name given to material which carries a verbal or illustrative processes, but not in the standard book, pamphlet or periodical format (Makepeace, 1985). Examples of ephamera are calendars, clippings, company reports, guides, information leaflets, menus, newsletters, newspapers, press release, and society ephemera. The acceptance of the collective term GL dates to the York Seminar of 1978 (Gibb G. M and Philip E. 1989), which was a milestone in its development. It was clearly recognized that GL was in fact, a primary information source, the seminar resulted in the creation of the System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE) database, which was initially supported by the European Economic Community (EEC) and is now managed by the European Association for Grey Literature. There are divergence of opinion regarding to the definition of GL. Moahi (1995) defined Grey Literature as 2 ̆ 2 material that is not commercially published and therefore not to be found in the normal channels associated with commercially published literature 2 ̆ 2. Grey Literature includes research reports, reports of meetings, conferences, seminars and workshops, students 2 ̆ 7 projects, theses and dissertations, in-house publications of associations and organizations and all forms of government publications including legislative materials, budgets and development plans. Augur (1989), citing Debachere defined Grey Literature as a term used variably by the intelligence community, librarians, and medical and research professionals to refer to a body of materials that cannot be found easily through conventional channels such as publishers, but which is frequently original and usually recent. Library of Congress subject Headings (LCSH) defined GL as 2 ̆ 2 reports, thesis, conference papers, translations of limited circulation and government documents. Wood (1984) cited in Kwafo-Akolo(1995) described GL as 2 ̆ 2 the material which is not available through the normal book selling. Sala(1995) describes GL as the documents that are not available through the conventional commercial distribution channels and therefore difficult to identify and obtain. The Russian National Public Library for science and technology views GL as a publications of limited circulation(under 1500 copies) issued by minor publishing houses that is hardly accessible. In summary GL can be referred to as unpopular but <b>precious</b> <b>semi</b> published information materials with very limited circulation which are not usually accessible through the normal commercial book channels such as publishers catalogue and book shops. Grey materials have a tremendous benefit not only to the users and authoritarian organizations, but also to the society at large. Auger,C. P (1994) noted that GL offer a number of advantages over other means of dissemination, including greater speed, greater flexibility and the opportunity to go into considerable detail if necessary. white papers (which is a type of GL) often contain useful findings based on surveys, interviews, and other forms of original research, and business white paper can be a valuable source of information to librarians and business practitioners (Juricek,John Eric 2009). GL also provides current information and facts on various topics. (Aina, 2004) Stated that 2 ̆ 2 Conventionally, grey literature in terms of its usage and function can be classified as reference sources that are considered occasionally for the provision of information and facts on a variety of topics, at users request. They provide background information on any topic, as well as current information. However because of the importance of these reference materials they are usually separated from the regular non-fiction books 2 ̆ 2. Evans(1995) is of the opinion that as the result and aspiration from library users who are anxious to make sense of the present, worried about future and hungry about information of the past, the only way to satisfy the hunger is to provide these patrons with information so that they can plan for the future,come to grip with the past and make positive changes here in the present, and this can only be achieved by adequately providing GL in the library. Another important reason for storage, preservation and dissemination of GL is the fact that users cannot rely solely on commercial avenues for vital information as most of the available information through books selling and distribution channels have been distorted and even some of these materials are quite expensive for average user to acquire. In a research conducted by Aina(1992) cited by kwafo-Akoto(1995) the result of the analysis of development of literature produced in Botswana over a 3 -year period showed that GL constituted 98...|$|R

2500|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} at {{many sites}} in Tamil Nadu including Arikamedu, Kodumanal, Kaveripumpattinam and Alagankulam, [...] have yielded a [...] variety of artifacts {{belonging to the}} Sangam era, such as various types of pottery and other items including [...] black and red ware, rouletted ware, [...] Russet coated ware, brick walls, ring wells, pits, industrial items, [...] {{and the remains of}} seeds and shells. Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil-Brahmic inscriptions on them, which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them. Archaeologists agree that activities best illustrated in these material records are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts. These excavations have provided evidence for the existence of the major economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature. Remnants of irrigation structures like reservoirs and ring wells and charred remains of seeds attest to the cultivation of different varieties of crops and knowledge of various agricultural techniques. Spinning whorls, cotton seeds, remains of a woven cotton cloth and dyeing vats provide evidence for the activities of the textile industry. Metallurgy has been supported by the discovery of an ancient blast furnace, along with its base and wall, anvil, slags and crucibles. The remains have indicated that, in addition to iron, the blacksmith may have worked with steel, lead, copper and bronze. The Kodumanal excavation recovered several jewellery items and <b>semi</b> <b>precious</b> stones at different stages of manufacture, suggesting that they were locally manufactured. Remains of import and export articles recovered from Arikamedu indicate the important role it played as an Indo-Roman trading station.
