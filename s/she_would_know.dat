25|$|Melisende's {{relationship}} with her son was complex. As a mother <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> her son and his capabilities, and she {{is known to have}} been particularly close to her children. As a ruler she may have been reluctant to entrust decision-making powers to an untried youth. Either way there was no political or social pressure to grant Baldwin any authority before 1152, even though Baldwin reached majority in 1145. Baldwin III and Melisende were jointly crowned as co-rulers on Christmas Day, 1143. This joint crowning was similar to Melisende's own crowning with her father in 1128, and may have reflected a growing trend to crown one's heir in the present monarch's lifetime, as demonstrated in other realms of this period.|$|E
25|$|One {{day after}} school, {{a young girl}} named Kilala Reno stumbles across a boy {{sleeping}} in her yard. After thinking to herself {{he looks like a}} Prince, she tries to kiss him, thinking it will wake him up, just like a kiss wakes up Sleeping Beauty. He does wake but only to fall back asleep again. Kilala then carries him inside her house and watches over him sleeping as she wonders who he is and where he came from. As she's folding his coat, a small tiara falls out, which she tries on. To her surprise, she feels just like one of the Disney Princesses. Then, Rei wakes up and accuses her of stealing the tiara. She calls him the Thief instead, questioning how <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> if he didn't steal it first. Rei's servant, Valdou, runs in and unintentionally breaks up the fight.|$|E
2500|$|The rabbi's wife {{plays an}} {{important}} community role, especially in small communities. In many ways, she is called on to be as knowledgeable as the rabbi {{in the realm of}} woman's observances: in this manner, for something that does not require a psak (ruling), she can be approached when a woman does not feel comfortable approaching the rabbi, or where the rabbi maybe should not be approached. [...] For instance, the rebbetzin may often be the [...] "mikvah lady" [...] and help with more mundane questions regarding the laws of niddah. [...] Part of it, certainly, is that she always has the rabbi's ear, and that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> if the question needs to be asked, {{in order to get a}} psak.|$|E

2500|$|Taylor becomes {{involved}} with Whipple [...] "Whip" [...] Jones III (Rick Hearst) through internet dating, in 2009. Tommy Garret of Canyon News said that Whip and Taylor's [...] "chemistry is magnificent". Whip was previously {{involved with}} Brooke; Garret wrote: [...] "Now he's {{in love with}} Brooke's mortal enemy Taylor Hayes Forrester... Hearst is magnificently suited for the role and fans want to see Whip and Taylor find happiness. At least for a few months." [...] Of their romance, Tylo said: [...] "I think Taylor has found true love with Whip. I think {{if she was a}} smart psychiatrist, and able to apply her knowledge in her own world, she would be with Whip. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> this is a healthy relationship. But Taylor doesn’t see it. She still wants to fix people." [...] Taylor and Whip marry in April 2010. Whip becomes jealous when Taylor admits to Stephanie that she still has feelings for Ridge. Whip's frustration with Taylor's feelings for Ridge leads to the demise of their relationship the following year, and they end the marriage.|$|E

60|$|At first his anxieties were past mention; but he grew restless under them, and the {{instinct}} {{of going to}} Mrs. Ponsonby prevailed. At least, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> what had transpired from James, or from Fitzjocelyn to Mrs. Frost.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} or two Margaret hesitated. She was persuaded Bob himself was not accountable, but she thought this was all <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>know.</b> She was hurt and humiliated, for now she had found Bob she had not helped Jimmy much.|$|E
60|$|In {{this state}} she awaited {{her husband and}} her son. She, too, had not seen Omar since his birth, but so many dreams had shown her what he would look like that she felt <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> him among a thousand.|$|E
