5|$|The Red Star Line changed Kroonland from American to Belgian {{registry}} on 6 November 1908 in Antwerp. One reason {{given for}} the change was to allow Red <b>Star</b> <b>to</b> hire non-American crews at lower cost. She made her maiden voyage under the Belgian flag the next day. In May 1911, Kroonlands crew, acting on rumors of an impending British mariner's strike, refused to sign on for the ship's next voyage, forcing Red <b>Star</b> <b>to</b> hire a replacement crew.|$|E

Gyamfi {{is the most}} successful of these, leading the Black <b>Stars</b> <b>to</b> three Africa Cup of Nations titles– in 1963, 1965 and 1982– making Gyamfi the joint most successful coach in the competition's history. Fred Osam Duodu led the Black <b>Stars</b> <b>to</b> their 1978 Africa Cup of Nations title; Ratomir Dujković, Milovan Rajevac, and James Kwesi Appiah, have all led the Black <b>Stars</b> <b>to</b> World Cup qualification.|$|R
5|$|A type Ia {{supernova}} (type one-a) {{is a type}} of supernova {{that occurs}} in binary systems (two stars orbiting one another) in which one of the stars is a white dwarf. The other star can be anything from a giant <b>star</b> <b>to</b> an even smaller white dwarf.|$|E
5|$|Astronomical {{distances}} {{are sometimes}} expressed in light-years, especially in popular science publications and media. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, around 9461billion kilometres, 5879billion miles, or 0.3066 parsecs. In round figures, a light year is nearly 10trillion kilometres or nearly 6trillion miles. Proxima Centauri, the closest <b>star</b> <b>to</b> Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away.|$|E
5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant <b>star</b> <b>to</b> the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright <b>star</b> <b>to</b> the south celestial pole.|$|E
50|$|The {{winner of}} the 1989 Hugo for Best Fanzine, OtherRealms, stated that Wyvern's Spur was an {{improvement}} over the first novel, Azure Bonds. The same reviewer Danny Low awarded 4 <b>stars</b> <b>to</b> this novel and 3 <b>stars</b> <b>to</b> Azure Bonds. The improved plotting and developments were points of praise.|$|R

50|$|In addition, the Aranda {{who come}} from central Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river or creek in the skyworld. This stellar river {{separates}} the two great camps of the Aranda and Luritja People. The <b>stars</b> <b>to</b> the east of this river represent the camps of the Aranda and the <b>stars</b> <b>to</b> the west represent Luritja encampments and some <b>stars</b> closer <b>to</b> the band represent a mixture of both.|$|R
5|$|Feller is {{credited}} with being the first baseball <b>star</b> <b>to</b> sign autographs at baseball memorabilia conventions, and was such a frequent guest at such events that one ESPN writer speculated {{that he may have}} signed more autographs than any other person.|$|E
5|$|For contact or semi-detached binaries, the {{transfer}} of mass from a <b>star</b> <b>to</b> its companion can also result in a significant transfer of angular momentum. The accreting companion can spin {{up to the point}} where it reaches its critical rotation rate and begins losing mass along the equator.|$|E
5|$|He {{became the}} first GAA <b>star</b> <b>to</b> gain an honorary {{doctorate}} from the University of Ulster, and was also voted BBC Northern Ireland Sports Personality of the Year, a regional award of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Following an email campaign throughout Ireland, Canavan was an early forerunner for the national award, {{despite the fact that}} Gaelic games have very little exposure in Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|Many Christians {{believe the}} star was a miraculous sign {{to mark the}} birth of the Christ (or Messiah). Some theologians claimed that the star {{fulfilled}} a prophecy, known as the Star Prophecy.

5|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{requirements}} for the existence of life around a star is the ability of that <b>star</b> <b>to</b> produce a terrestrial planet of sufficient mass to sustain it. Various elements, such as iron, magnesium, titanium, carbon, oxygen, silicon, and others, are required to produce habitable planets, and the concentration and ratios of these vary throughout the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|The {{break-up}} {{velocity of}} a star is an expression {{that is used to}} describe the case where the centrifugal force at the equator is equal to the gravitational force. For a <b>star</b> <b>to</b> be stable the rotational velocity must be below this value.|$|E

5|$|The {{hydrogen}} fusion {{process is}} temperature-sensitive, so a moderate {{increase in the}} core temperature {{will result in a}} significant increase in the fusion rate. As a result, the core temperature of main sequence stars only varies from 4 million kelvin for a small M-class <b>star</b> <b>to</b> 40 million kelvin for a massive O-class star.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} interacts with the stellar wind. As the wind {{moves away from the}} star its rate of angular velocity slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star interacts with the wind, which applies a drag to the stellar rotation. As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the <b>star</b> <b>to</b> the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E
