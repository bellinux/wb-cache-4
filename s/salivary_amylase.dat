25|$|Carbohydrates are a {{food source}} rich in energy. Following the {{agricultural}} revolution 12,000 years ago, human diet began to {{rely more on}} plant and animal domestication in place of hunting and gathering. This shift also symbolizes {{the beginning of a}} diet composed of 49% carbohydrates as opposed to the previous 35% observed in Paleolithic humans. As such, starch became a staple of human diet. Large polymers such as starch are partially hydrolyzed in the mouth by the enzyme amylase before being cleaved further into sugars. Therefore, humans that contained amylase in the saliva would benefit from increased ability to digest starch more efficiently and in higher quantities. Despite the obvious benefits, early humans did not possess <b>salivary</b> <b>amylase,</b> a trend that is also seen in evolutionary relatives of the human, such as chimpanzees and bonobos, who possess either one or no copies of the gene responsible for producing <b>salivary</b> <b>amylase.</b> This gene, AMY1, originated in the pancreas. A duplication event of the AMY1 gene allowed it to evolve salivary specificity, leading to the production of amylase in the saliva. In addition the same event occurred independently in rodents, emphasizing the importance of <b>salivary</b> <b>amylase</b> in organisms that consume relatively large amounts of starch.|$|E

40|$|Objectives Assessment {{of dental}} pain {{severity}} is very challenging in dentistry. Previous {{studies have suggested}} that elevated <b>salivary</b> alpha <b>amylase</b> may contribute to increased physical stresses. There is a close association between <b>salivary</b> alpha <b>amylase</b> and plasma norepinephrine under stressful physical conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the relationship between pain severity and <b>salivary</b> alpha <b>amylase</b> levels in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. Materials and Methods Thirty-six patients (20 females and 16 males) with severe tooth pain due to symptomatic irreversible pulpitis were selected. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score was used to assess the pain severity in each patient. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected, and the level of alpha amylase activity was assessed by the spectrophotometric method. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13. Results The level of alpha amylase was significantly increased in the saliva in association with pain severity assessed by VAS. The <b>salivary</b> alpha <b>amylase</b> was also elevated with increased age and in males. Conclusions There was a significant correlation between the VAS pain scale and <b>salivary</b> alpha <b>amylase</b> level, which indicates this biomarker may be a good index for the objective assessment of pain intensity. ...|$|R
30|$|Multiple linear {{regression}} revealed three variables predicting 15  % {{of the variance}} in heart rate response (area under the individual heart rate response curve during TSST-G) and four variables predicting 12  % {{of the variance in}} <b>salivary</b> alpha <b>amylase</b> response (<b>salivary</b> alpha <b>amylase</b> level immediately after the TSST-G) to acute psychosocial stress. A strong performance at the progressive endurance run (high maximal oxygen consumption) {{was a significant predictor of}} ANS response in both models: low area under the heart rate response curve during TSST-G as well as low <b>salivary</b> alpha <b>amylase</b> level after TSST-G. Further, high muscle power, non-smoking, high extraversion, and low agreeableness were predictors of a favourable ANS response in either one of the two dependent variables.|$|R
30|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{the present}} study to {{investigate}} the role of physical fitness level on ANS (i.e. heart rate and <b>salivary</b> alpha <b>amylase)</b> responses to acute psychosocial stress, while controlling for established factors influencing individual stress reactions. Using the framework of the cross-stressor adaptation in the present study, the hypothesis was that the individual physical fitness level modifies the physiological stress responses to non-exercise stressors. Lower baseline heart rate (HR), stronger HR reaction to non-exercise stressors, faster HR recovery after termination of a non-exercise stressor, and lower <b>salivary</b> alpha <b>amylase</b> (sAA) immediately after the non-exercise stressor are expected in physically well-trained subjects.|$|R
25|$|The {{salivary glands}} of some species however, are {{modified}} to produce proteins; <b>salivary</b> <b>amylase</b> {{is found in}} many, {{but by no means}} all, bird and mammal species (including humans, as noted above). Furthermore, the venom glands of venomous snakes (colloquially called poisonous snakes), Gila monsters, and some shrews, are modified salivary glands. In other organisms such as insects, salivary glands are often used to produce biologically important proteins like silk or glues, and fly salivary glands contain polytene chromosomes that have been useful in genetic research.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{digestive}} system, food enters {{the mouth and}} mechanical digestion of the food starts {{by the action of}} mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains <b>salivary</b> <b>amylase,</b> an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be {{in the form of a}} small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Amylase is {{an enzyme}} in saliva that is {{responsible}} for the breakdown of starch into monosaccharides, and one type of amylase is encoded by the alpha-amylase gene (AMY1). The AMY1 locus, as well as the amylase enzyme, {{is one of the most}} extensively studied and sequenced gene in the human genome. Its homologs are also found in other primates and therefore it is likely that the primate AMY1 gene is ancestral to the human AMY1 gene and was adapted early in primate evolution. AMY1 is a particularly interesting gene to examine as it is one of the most well studied genes which has wide range of variable numbers of copies throughout different human populations. The AMY1 gene is also one of the few genes that had been studied that displayed convincing evidence which correlates its protein function to its copy number. Copy number is known to alter transcription as well as translation levels of a particular gene, however research has shown that the relationship between protein levels and copy number is variable. In the AMY1 genes of European Americans it is found that the concentration of <b>salivary</b> <b>amylase</b> is closely correlated to the copy number of the AMY1 gene. As a result, it was hypothesized that the copy number of the AMY1 gene is closely correlated with its protein function, which is to digest starch.|$|E
40|$|Objective <b>Salivary</b> mucin and <b>amylase</b> {{levels are}} {{increased}} {{in patients with}} chronic periodontitis (CP).

Material and Methods Eighty subjects were divided into two groups: 20 patients with AgP and their 20 matched controls and 20 patients with CP and their 20 matched controls, based on clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BOP). Whole unstimulated saliva was obtained and mucin, amylase and protein were determined by colorimetric methods. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between <b>salivary</b> mucin, <b>amylase</b> and protein levels and the clinical parameters. Results <b>Salivary</b> mucin, <b>amylase</b> and protein levels were increased in patients with AgP and CP but there were no differences between them or between control groups. Pearson's correlation analysis, determined in the entire subjects studied, showed a positive and significant correlation of mucin, amylase and proteins with CAL and PPD and a negative correlation with the flow rate. When Pearson's correlation analysis was carried out in each group separately, Fisher's z transformation showed no significant difference between both groups.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that overweight/obese men aged 50 – 70 years will have a greater salivary cortisol, <b>salivary</b> alpha <b>amylase</b> and heart rate (HR) responses to psychological stress compared with age matched lean men. Lean (BMIZ 20 – 25 kg/m 2; nZ 19) and overweight/obese (BMIZ 27 – 35 kg/m 2; nZ 17) men (50 – 70 years) were subjected to a well-characterised psychological stress (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) at 1500 h. Concentrations of cortisol and alpha amylase were measured in saliva samples collected every 7 – 15 min from 1400 to  1700 h. HR was recorded using electrocardiogram. Body weight, BMI, percentage body fat, resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were significantly higher (P! 0. 05) in overweight/obese men compared with lean men. Both groups responded to the TSST with a substantial elevation in salivary cortisol (372 %), salivary alpha amylase (123 %) and HR (22 %). These responses {{did not differ significantly}} between the groups (time!treatment interaction for salivary cortisol, <b>salivary</b> alpha <b>amylase</b> and HR; PZ 0. 187, PZ 0. 288, PZ 0. 550, respectively).

25|$|Although it {{is unclear}} when the AMY1 gene copy number began to increase, it is known and {{confirmed}} that the AMY1 gene existed in early primates. Chimpanzees, the closest evolutionary relatives to humans, {{were found to have}} 2 diploid copies of the AMY1 gene that is identical in length to the human AMY1 gene, which is significantly less than that of humans. On the other hand, bonobos, also a close relative of modern humans, was found to have more than 2 diploid copies of the AMY1 gene. Nonetheless, the bonobo AMY1 genes were sequenced and analyzed, and {{it was found that the}} coding sequences of the AMY1 genes were disrupting, which may lead to the production of dysfunctional <b>salivary</b> <b>amylase.</b> It can be inferred from the results that the increase in bonobo AMY1 copy number is likely not correlated to the amount of starch in their diet. It was further hypothesized that the increase in copy number began recently during early hominin evolution as none of the great apes had more than two copies of the AMY1 gene that produced functional protein. In addition, it was speculated that the increase in the AMY1 copy number began around 20,000 years ago when humans shifted from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agricultural societies, which was also when humans relied heavily on root vegetables high in starch. This hypothesis, although logical, lacks experimental evidence due to the difficulties in gathering information on the shift of human diets, especially on root vegetables that are high in starch as they cannot be directly observed or tested. Recent breakthroughs in DNA sequencing has allowed researchers to sequence older DNA such as that of Neanderthals to a certain degree of accuracy. Perhaps sequencing Neanderthal DNA can provide a time marker as to when the AMY1 gene copy number increased and offer insight into human diet and gene evolution.|$|E
25|$|The AMY1 gene {{copy number}} {{has been found}} to be {{correlated}} to different levels of starch in diets of different populations. 8 Populations from different continents were categorized into high starch diets and low starch diets and their AMY1 gene copy number was visualized using high resolution FISH and qPCR. It was found that the high starch diet populations which consists of the Japanese, Hadza, and European American populations had a significantly higher (2 times higher) average AMY1 copy number than the low starch diet populations including Biaka, Mbuti, Datog, Yakut populations. It was hypothesized that the levels of starch in one’s regular diet, the substrate for AMY1, can directly affect the copy number of the AMY1 gene. Since it was concluded that the copy number of AMY1 is directly correlated with <b>salivary</b> <b>amylase,</b> the more starch present in the population’s daily diet, the more evolutionarily favorable it is to have multiple copies of the AMY1 gene. The AMY1 gene was the first gene to provide strong evidence for evolution on a molecular genetics level. Moreover, using comparative genomic hybridization, copy number variations of the entire genomes of the Japanese population was compared to that of the Yakut population. It was found that the copy number variation of the AMY1 gene was significantly different from the copy number variation in other genes or regions of the genome, suggesting that the AMY1 gene was under a strong selective pressure that had little or no influence on the other copy number variations. Finally, the variability of length of 783 microsatellites between the two populations were compared to copy number variability of the AMY1 gene. It was found that the AMY1 gene copy number range was larger than that of over 97% of the microsatellites examined. This implies that natural selection played a considerable role in shaping the average number of AMY1 genes in these two populations. However, as only 6 populations were studied, it is important to consider the possibility that there may be other factors in their diet or culture that influenced the AMY1 copy number other than starch.|$|E
