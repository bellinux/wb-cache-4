These are: years of education, years of education squared, age, age squared, a gender dummy variable, an urban/rural <b>dummy</b> variable, a <b>set</b> of <b>dummy</b> variables for one-digit industry code, and a <b>set</b> of <b>dummy</b> variables representing the frequency of wage payments. 5 [...]...|$|R

As we discussed in Sect.  2, individuals spending more time on housework may select themselves into less demanding jobs or jobs with more flexible working conditions and thus negative compensating wage differentials. To control for this sort of selection, we further include a dummy for flexible working hours and a <b>set</b> of <b>dummies</b> for the (one-digit) occupation.|$|R
40|$|We examine {{starting}} point bias in CV surveys with dichotomous choice payment questions and follow-ups, and double-bounded {{models of the}} WTP responses. We wish to investigate (1) {{the seriousness of the}} biases for the location and scale parameters of WTP in the presence of {{starting point}} bias; (2) whether or not these biases depend on the distribution of WTP and on the bids used; and (3) how well a commonly used diagnostic for starting point bias 9 ̆ 7 a test of the null that bid <b>set</b> <b>dummies</b> entered in the right-hand side of the WTP model are jointly equal to zero 9 ̆ 7 performs under various circumstances. Because starting point bias cannot be separately identified in any reliable manner from biases caused by model specification, we use simulation approaches to address this issue. Our Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the effect of ignoring starting point bias is complex and depends on the true distribution of WTP. Bid <b>set</b> <b>dummies</b> tend to soak up misspecifications in the distribution assumed by the researcher for the latent WTP, rather than capturing the presence of starting point bias. Their power in detecting starting point bias is low...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel test rig, developed to analyse the behaviour of rolling element bearings subjected to highly varying loads. The design is optimised {{to measure the}} bearing behaviour, free from dynamics of the surrounding structure. In the current study, the test rig is {{used to evaluate the}} stiffness of a deep groove ball bearing under different operational conditions. The bearing behaviour is measured using the modal analysis technique. Then, an analytical model of the test structure is fitted on the data to estimate the bearing stiffness. The stiffness estimation is validated using a <b>dummy</b> <b>bearing</b> with a known stiffness. Finally, the stiffness of a mounted ball bearing is estimated. The paper evaluates the effect of a radial static load on the bearing stiffness. Stationary and operational conditions are compared as well. A clear difference between the stiffness of a rotating and non-rotating bearing is observed. status: publishe...|$|R

Sheng Long is surprised that his pupils Ryu and Ken haven’t come to visit him, but Nida tells him of a new street fighter tournament that is approaching and believes {{that they might be}} training for it. Sheng Long promises Nida to teach him Shotokan karate once he recovers, but she fears that he may never be able to overcome the deadly poison in his body. After leaving Sheng Long to rest, Nida goes into another room to train, and smashes a <b>dummy</b> <b>bearing</b> a photo of Ryu, vowing that once he defeats Ken’s killer to restore their master’s honor, he will have to face her next.|$|R

30|$|Both {{starting}} point bias and shift effect were {{accounted for in}} the empirical estimation. Starting point bias was controlled for by using two approaches, the first proposed by Chien et al. (2005) and the second by Whitehead (2002). Following Chien et al. (2005), two bid <b>set</b> <b>dummies</b> were constructed and included in {{the model for the}} three premium bid sets shown in Table  1. The last bid set ($ 2.00, $ 1.20, and $ 3.00) was assigned as the reference dummy. Following Alberini et al. (1997) and Whitehead (2002), the shift effect was empirically determined as the coefficient of a dummy variable equal to 1 for the follow-up question, and 0 otherwise, following the transformation of the data into a quasi-panel dataset. The {{starting point}} bias which is determined by the anchoring weight γ is the coefficient of the interaction between the dummy variable on the follow-up question and the starting point bid.|$|R

40|$|The {{last several}} years have seen a {{growth in the number}} of {{publications}} in economics that use principal component analysis (PCA) in the area of welfare studies. This paper explores the ways discrete data can be incorporated into PCA. The effects of discreteness of the observed variables on the PCA are reviewed. The statistical properties of the popular Filmer and Pritchett (2001) procedure are analyzed. The concepts of polychoric and polyserial correlations are introduced with appropriate references to the existing literature demonstrating their statistical properties. A large simulation study is carried out to compare various implementations of discrete data PCA. The simulation results show that the currently used method of running PCA on a <b>set</b> of <b>dummy</b> variables as proposed by Filmer and Pritchett (2001) can be improved upon by using procedures appropriate for discrete data, such as retaining the ordinal variables without breaking them into a <b>set</b> of <b>dummy</b> variables or using polychoric correlations. An empirical example using Bangladesh 2000 Demographic and Health Survey data helps in explaining the differences between procedures. 1...|$|R

30|$|We {{start the}} {{analysis}} by assessing {{the importance of}} our variables of interest in improving the explanatory power of the empirical model.

30|$|The {{extremely}} high values of R-squared in FE are {{probably due to}} the inclusion of the large <b>set</b> of <b>dummies</b> (country, sector and time fixed effects) in our FE regressions. Therefore, such high explanatory power should be largely ascribed to fixed effects, which indeed we can interpret just as general institutional, technological and time factors driving productivity differentials. Nonetheless, their inclusion should help us to alleviate significantly the omitted variable bias and, consequently, to isolate the impact of our variables of interest (EPL and TE).|$|R

30|$|Finally, we {{extent the}} model by two <b>sets</b> of <b>dummy</b> {{variables}} covering policy regimes. The first equals one for all {{years in which}} country d allowed workers of country h free access to its labor market, and zero otherwise. The second dummy equals one for all years in which country d partially restricted the access of workers from country h to its labor market, and zero otherwise. Hence, full restriction forms the reference category (see Table A. 1 in the appendix for {{a detailed description of}} these policy dummies).|$|R
