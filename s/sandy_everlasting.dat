40|$|The {{significance}} of root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi {{for the growth}} and development of Helichrysum arenarium was investigated in two independent experiments. In the first experiment the association of root colonization level with the pluviothermal conditions within the growing season {{and the age of}} a natural plant population was analyzed. In the second one, under controlled conditions, the influence of artificial inoculation with the arbuscular fungus Glomus intraradices on the features of plants raised from achenes was studied. It was shown that hydrothermal conditions during blooming period had a greater influence on reproduction processes of <b>sandy</b> <b>everlasting</b> than both the population age (the secondary succession progress) and the level of root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi. High amount of precipitation at plant generative development phase positively influences the potential and actual fertility of ramets. The presence of arbuscular fungus in the soil favors the growth and development of <b>sandy</b> <b>everlasting</b> specimens at their early growing stages: they have a better-developed root system and a greater photosynthetic area...|$|E
