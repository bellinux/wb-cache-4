Twenty–one stable maintenance hemodialysis patients were studied in a crossover format with hemofiltration {{to determine whether}} the lower incidence of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> noted with hemofiltration could be correlated with changes in baroreflex function as tested using the cold pressor test and amyl nitrite inhalation study. Baroreflex function remained abnormal and unchanged in all patients {{in the face of a}} reduced incidence of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension.</b> Subdivision of the patients into frequent (> 1 episode/treatment) and infrequent (< 1 episode/treatment) reactors during the hemodialysis control period resulted in the infrequent reactors, showing a significant increase in episodes of symptomatic hypotension/hemofiltration treatment where a significant reduction was noted with the frequent reactors. No clear correlation could be made between the incidence of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> and the pre- to post-treatment change in body temperature.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Although both orthostatic {{hypotension}} and {{urinary incontinence}} {{have been reported}} in a number of parkinsonian syndromes, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), differences in the evolution of these features have not been studied systematically in pathologically confirmed cases.  METHODS— 77 cases with pathologically confirmed parkinsonian syndromes (PD, n= 11; MSA, n= 15; DLB, n= 14; CBD, n= 13; PSP, n= 24), collected up to 1994, formed the basis for a multicentre clinicopathological study organised by the NINDS to improve the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders. The present study determined the time course—that is, latency to onset and duration from onset to death, of <b>symptomatic</b> orthostatic <b>hypotension,</b> and urinary incontinence in the NINDS series. Furthermore, the diagnostic validity of a predefined latency to onset within 1 year of disease onset of <b>symptomatic</b> orthostatic <b>hypotension</b> or urinary incontinence was analysed.  RESULTS—Significant group differences for latency, but not duration, of <b>symptomatic</b> orthostatic <b>hypotension</b> and urinary incontinence were found. Latencies to onset of either feature were short in patients with MSA, intermediate in patients with DLB, CBD, and PSP, and long in those with PD. <b>Symptomatic</b> orthostatic <b>hypotension</b> occurring within the first year after disease onset predicted MSA in 75 % of cases; early urinary incontinence was less predictive for MSA (56 %).  CONCLUSION—Latency to onset, but not duration, of <b>symptomatic</b> orthostatic <b>hypotension</b> or urinary incontinence differentiates PD from other parkinsonian syndromes, particularly MSA. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{aim of this}} multicenter {{prospective}} {{study was to investigate}} the role of relative blood volume (RBV) reduction on intradialytic hypotension. METHODS: One hundred twenty-three patients on chronic hemodialysis therapy were considered a priori normotensive (reference group A), intradialytic hypotension prone (group B), and hypertensive (group C). RBV was continuously monitored, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured at 20 -minute intervals during three dialysis sessions. RESULTS: Intradialytic RBV reduction was - 13. 8 % +/- 7. 0 % and similar in the three groups (P = 0. 841). SBP and RBV decreased during dialysis, with a sharp initial decrease (in the first 20 minutes for SBP and the first 40 minutes for RBV), followed by a slower decrease. The lying bradycardic response before dialysis was less in group B than group A (a decrease of 3 +/- 7 versus 9 +/- 9 beats/min; P < 0. 001). When <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> occurred, RBV reduction was not significantly different from that recorded at the same time during hypotension-free sessions (- 13. 9 % +/- 6. 4 % versus - 12. 7 % +/- 5. 2 %; P = 0. 149). Group, baseline plasma-dialysate sodium gradient, RBV line irregularity, and early RBV and HR reduction during dialysis influenced the relative risk for <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> with a sensitivity of 80 % versus 30 % for RBV alone. CONCLUSION: We found no difference in reduction in RBV in the three groups and no critical RBV level for the appearance of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension.</b> With variables easily available within 40 minutes of dialysis, RBV monitoring increases the prediction of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension.</b> Copyright 2002 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Intradialytic {{hypotension}} is {{the most}} common acute complication during conventional hemodialysis treatment. Prediction of such events is highly desirable in clinical routine for prevention. This paper presents a novel prediction method of acute <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> in which the photoplethysmographic signal is analyzed with respect to changes in amplitude, reflecting vasoconstriction, and cardiac output. The method is based on a statistical model in which the noise is assumed to have Laplacian amplitude distribution. The performance is evaluated on 11 hypotension-prone patients who underwent hemodialysis treatment, resulting in seven events with acute <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> and 17 without. The photoplethysmographic signal was continuously acquired during treatment as was information on blood pressure and oxygen saturation. Using leave-one-out cross validation, the proposed method predicted six out of seven hypotensive events, while producing 1 false prediction out of 17 possible. The performance was achieved when the prediction threshold was chosen to be in the range 57 %- 65 % of the photoplethysmographic envelope at treatment onset...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Symptomatic</b> orthostatic <b>hypotension</b> is {{a serious}} problem in the elderly because it can {{precipitate}} falls and fractures, myocardial infarctions, and strokes. Several disorders may cause <b>symptomatic</b> orthostatic <b>hypotension</b> including age-related changes in physiology, disorders of the autonomic nervous system, drugs, and a decrease in circulating blood volume. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a fall in systolic pressure of at least 20 - 30 mm Hg and a fall in diastolic pressure of at least 10 - 15 mm Hg upon rising, with symptoms of cerebral ischemia. Management includes a search for reversible causes as well as non pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. No single agent has been universally successful in relieving the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. Trials of single agents or combinations of agents are needed to identify the most appropriate therapy for individual patients. otce 1989; 23 : 750 - 6...|$|R

Finally, the patient’s orthostatic hypotension recovered after corticosteroid treatment.

40|$|Effects of cooler {{temperature}} dialysate on hemodynamic {{stability in}} “problem” dialysis patients. <b>Symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> {{is a common}} and disabling complication of hemodialysis treatments. The incidence of symptomatic hypotensive episodes is particularly high in patients who have normal or low blood pressure at the initiation of dialysis and in patients who have large interdialytic weight gains. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether cooling the dialysate temperature from 37 °C to 35 °C improved tolerance to dialysis in a group of 12 of these “problem” patients. A double-blinded protocol was performed in six hypotension-prone and six large weight gainers who were subjected to two identical hemodialyses except for the dialysate temperature of 37 °C or 35 °C. Changes in biochemical parameters and weight were comparable during the two maneuvers. Recumbent blood pressure declined significantly (P < 0. 01) during 37 °C dialysis but not 35 °C dialysis; blood pressure was significantly lower at 1, 2, and 3 hours of 37 °C dialysis compared to 35 °C dialysis (P < 0. 05). Further, both supine and upright blood pressure was significantly lower following 37 °C dialysis (P < 0. 02). This lower blood pressure was present in both subgroups of patients. All 18 episodes of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> noted during the study occurred during 37 °C dialysis. A significantly greater increase in peripheral vascular resistance (calf blood flow was measured directly by venous occlusion plethysmography) occurred upon exposure to the 35 °C dialysate in both subgroups of patients (P < 0. 01); supine and upright post-dialysis plasma norepinephrine values were also significantly greater (P < 0. 001) after 35 ° dialysis. Thus, 35 °C dialysate significantly improves the hemodynamic tolerance to hemodialysis in hypotension-prone and large weight gainer patient groups and also reduces the incidence of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension.</b> This improvement is partly the result of a greater increase in peripheral vascular resistance, possibly mediated via the efferent sympathetic nervous system...|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between pretreatment serum sodium concentration {{and the early}} and late effects of captopril was examined in 77 consecutive patients with severe chronic heart failure, in whom cardiac catheterization was performed during initiation of treatment and after 2 to 8 weeks. Two groups of patients were defined: 37 patients had hyponatremia (serum sodium - 135 mEq/liter, group B). With first doses of captopril, patients in group A showed more marked hemodynamic responses than did patients in group B (p< 0. 02). The changes in mean arterial pressure and left ventricular filling pressure seen with first doses of the drug varied linearly and inversely with the pretreatment serum sodium concentration (r = - 0. 58 and r = - 0. 53, respectively); this was likely related to the finding that, before administration of captopril, the serum sodium concentration varied linearly and inversely with the logarithm of the plasma renin activity (r = ‒ 0. 78). However, the pretreatment serum sodium concentration did not predict the long-term hemodynamic or clinical responses to converting enzyme inhibition. <b>Symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> occurred early {{in the course of}} therapy (within 24 hours of initiating captopril therapy) in 9 (12 ° 10) of the 77 patients; 8 of these 9 had severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mEq/liter) and comprised 53 ° 10 of the 15 patients in our study with such low serum sodium concentrations. In contrast, <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> occurring late during therapy (after 1 to 4 weeks) was related to an excessive long-term reduction in left ventricular filling pressure (!s~ 14 mm Hg) and not to serum sodium concentration. In conclusion, patients with severe heart failure complicated by severe hyponatremia are more than 30 times more likely to develop <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> during initiation of therapy with captopril than are patients with a serum sodium concentration of 130 mEq/liter or greater.

Sixteen patients had both ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, 30 had ventricular tachycardia alone and 10 had ventricular fibrillation alone. Programmed stimulation on no antiarrhythmic drugs induced sustained ventricular tachycardia in 46 patients, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 4 patients and ventricular fibrillation in 6 patients. During programmed ventricular stimulation after 59 trials of 20 to 30 mg/kg body weight of oral bethanidine (acute dosing in 40 patients, and divided dosing over 24 hours in 19 patients), no ventricular tachyarrhythmias were inducible in 6 patients (11 %), sustained ventricular tachycardia was converted to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 3 patients (5 %), ventricular tachyarrhythmias remained inducible in 39 patients (70 %) and spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred more frequently in 4 patients (7 %). Side effects prevented repeat testing in four patients.

Of the 937, 184 (20 %) had symptoms of dizziness upon standing and were considered to have <b>symptomatic</b> orthostatic <b>hypotension.</b> Propensity scores for orthostatic hypotension were estimated {{for each of the}} 5, 273 participants and were used to assemble a cohort of 3, 510 participants (883 participants with and 2, 627 participants without orthostatic hypotension) who were balanced on 40 baseline characteristics. Cox regression models were used to estimate {{the association of}} orthostatic hypotensio...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} medication induced metabolic alkalosis in a maintenance dialysis patient who developed severe hypotension while undergoing a lactate hemofiltration procedure. A 73 -year-old man with ESRD due to renovascular disease was used to ingesting up to 30 grams per day of a non-prescription medication (Effervescent granulate 250 grams, CRASTAN(TM), Pisa Italy) consisting of sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, glucose and lemon flavor. For technical problem lactate hemofiltration was performed and thirty minutes after dialysis was started a severe <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> occurred (blood pressure 65 / 35 mmHg). Lactate hemofiltration was suspended and one-hour later standard bicarbonate dialysis was performed without any clinical problem. The different mechanisms in acidosis buffering occurring in lactate and bicarbonate hemofiltration were discussed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{sought to}} define the {{variables}} associated with hospital outcome in preterm infants with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and identify the optimal timing for PDA closure to improve hospital outcome. METHODS: Included were 201 premature babies (< or = 32 weeks gestational age), from January 2001 to June 2007, with PDA who received primary medical treatment with ibuprofen. Number of ibuprofen cycles, gestational age, body weight, and presence of <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> requiring vasoactive/inotropic drugs were related to hospital outcome, including hospital mortality, presence of necrotizing enterocolitis, acute renal failure, intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy and bronchopulmonary dysplasia at week 36. Data were analyzed with a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Medical treatment was effective in 149 patients (75 %), but 52 (25 %) required surgical ligation after medical treatment failed. They had younger gestational age (25 weeks [IQR, 24 to 27 weeks] vs 27 weeks [IQR, 25 to 28 weeks], p < 0. 0001), lower body weight at birth (730 g [IQR, 595 to 915 g] vs 840 g [IQR, 670 to 1016], p = 0. 05), and {{a higher incidence of}} <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> (38 of 52 [73 %] vs 56 of 149 [38 %], p < 0. 0001) than patients who responded to ibuprofen. More than two cycles of ibuprofen was significantly associated with an increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (odds ratio [OR], 2. 81; p = 0. 03) and acute renal failure (OR, 3. 81; p = 0. 09). CONCLUSIONS: The prolonged patency of the ductus arteriosus in preterm infants is related to an increased morbidity. Surgical ligation of PDA is a safe and effective treatment and should be done soon after two complete cycles of ibuprofen, especially in selected patients, to improve clinical outcome...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{vasodilator}} {{effects of}} nitroglycerin (NTG) are mediated via activation of guanylate cyclase; {{this process is}} believed to require the availability of free sulfhydryl groups. Previous studies in man {{have shown that the}} sulfhydryl donor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) potentiates the systemic and coronary vasodilator effects of NTG. Furthermore, interaction of NTG and NAC may lead to the formation of S-nitroso-NAC, which strongly inhibits platelet aggregation. The effects of intravenous NTG combined with intravenous NAC (5 g 6 hourly) were compared with those of intravenous NTG alone in a double-blind trial in 46 patients with severe unstable angina pectoris unresponsive to conventional treatment, which included calcium antagonists and cutaneous nitrates in all but one patient. Treatment with NTG/NAC (24 patients) and that with NTG alone (22 patients) was associated with a similar frequency of episodes of chest pain and of increments inNTG infusion rate for pain control (10 vs 17; p = NS). The NTG/NAC group had a significantly lower incidence of acute myocardial infarction than the NTG/placebo group (three vs 10 patients; p =. 013). <b>Symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension</b> occurred frequently in the NTG/NAC group (seven vs 0 patients; p =. 006). Lactate-pyruvate ratios and venous NTG concentrations were not significantly affected by NAC. Subsequently, another 20 con-secutive patients were treated with intravenous NTG and continuously infused NAC (10 g/day). Seven remained pain free during the first 24 hr of NTG infusion; 11 required increments in NTG infusion rate for pain control. Acute myocardial infarction occurred in one patient, while none developed <b>symptomatic</b> <b>hypotension.</b> It is concluded that combined administration ofNTG and NAC may augment the clinical efficacy of NTG, particularly by preventing acute myocardial infarction. However, the risk of development of hypotension with combined NTG/NAC is increased when NAC is administered by rapid intravenous infusion...|$|E
50|$|Droxidopa was {{developed}} by Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals {{for the treatment of}} hypotension, including NOH, and NOH associated with various disorders such as MSA, FAP, and PD, as well as IDH. The drug has been used in Japan and some surrounding Asian areas for these indications since 1989. Following a merger with Dainippon Pharmaceuticals in 2006, Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma licensed droxidopa to Chelsea Therapeutics to develop and market it worldwide except in Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan. In February 2014, the Food and Drug Administration approved droxidopa for the treatment of <b>symptomatic</b> neurogenic orthostatic <b>hypotension.</b>|$|R
40|$|Ivermectin (Mectizan ®) is {{the only}} drug {{currently}} recommended for the treatment and control of onchocerciasis. Serious adverse events rarely occur during treatment, except in subjects heavily infected with Loa Loa. This review of drug-related serious adverse events {{in the treatment of}} onchocerciasis therefore revisited the pre-Mectizan ® reference drugs, DEC and suramin, and other candidate drugs studied extensively for the treatment of human onchocerciasis. The benzimidazole carbamate derivatives and the antibiotic doxycycline were excluded, since no serious adverse events have been reported regarding their use. Using recommended definitions, serious adverse events reported or observed after the use of each drug were summarised, the level of attribution determined, and the results tabulated. Prominence was given to treatment-related deaths. The clinical picture of severe <b>symptomatic</b> postural <b>hypotension</b> is described and used to illustrate the difference between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event. The epidemiology, management and outcome of serious adverse events are presented. The role of future research is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In a double-blind, random-order, {{cross-over}} study {{the effects of}} placebo and 100 mg of caffeine on postprandial sitting and erect blood pressure and heart rate were studied in 20 frail elderly subjects (mean age 84, range 75 - 93 years) after a standardized 400 K-calorie glucose drink. Maximal postprandial reduction in sitting systolic blood pressure occurred, at 60 minutes post-placebo, of - 11 mmHg (95 % confidence interval - 5 to - 17 mmHg, P less than 0. 01), and was attenuated by caffeine (P less than 0. 05) with changes in systolic blood pressure, at 60 minutes post-drink, of 1 mmHg (95 % CI - 6 to 7 mmHg, not significant). Four subjects developed <b>symptomatic</b> postprandial <b>hypotension</b> after placebo which was prevented by caffeine. There were no significant changes in erect systolic blood pressure, postural systolic blood pressure change, sitting and erect, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate between treatment phases. Caffeine attenuates the postprandial fall in sitting blood pressure in frail elderly subjects and in particular prevented symptomatic blood pressure reductions in subjects with postprandial hypotension...|$|R
