5000|$|Don Jose himself <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> {{his home}} in Mexico City saying Danseco did [...] "a very good job as a judge in two fights. I was happily surprised." [...] So are we. And while the Rubillar-Omar Nino fight was not very {{exciting}} we congratulate Rubillar on his win in Mexico and Danseco for his performance as a judge because he earned our respect - if it means anything to him - and the respect of fight fans even in Mexico {{and most of all}} our esteemed friend Don José Sulaimán." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{held the}} sixpence {{in the palm}} of his hand, and looking at it thoughtfully, <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in English.|$|R
60|$|The first Sunday after Fred's death, {{the captain}} {{assembled}} the crew on the quarter-deck, and <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Charlie said; [...] "Doctor Rae <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{about him}} during the voyage. He knew him at the siege of Fort Saint David, and Pondicherry." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{ran over}} {{and saw him}} spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door. There he turned and <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> your Excellency. He {{wanted to}} know if he could hire a horse and cart to go down along the St. Martin road, to a place he wanted to reach to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{perfectly}} {{sure that}} the voices that <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> last night were a subtle delusion, an emanation from our own bodies--or {{the work of a}} joker. My reason repels them as spirits." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "While {{recognising}} {{that season}} ticket holders had already {{paid for this}} game {{as part of their}} 2009 ticket, we had planned to discount their 2010 season ticket but were heartened that a number of fans <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> say that they understood the 'bigger picture' and were keen to back the club's initiative for that game without recompense.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{went away}} the same day--very unwillingly. The parting {{between them was}} most affecting. The brother who <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> to-night insisted on it--or the other would have refused to leave him. They both shed tears----" ...|$|R
60|$|When {{his anger}} had cooled a little Jan <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{in this sense}} and we women agreed with him; but Ralph, who was young, fearless, and full of rage, set his mouth and said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "To us," [...] {{she said}} slowly, [...] "to Madame de Melbain and to me, {{he was a}} ghost, an actual apparition. He <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> with the voice of one whom we know to be dead. He came <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> in his form." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Ralph, what a bat you are! He was grave {{enough just}} now, truly; {{but did you}} not observe the {{twinkle in his eye}} when he <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in English? Depend on it he's a funny dog." ...|$|R
60|$|We all {{entered the}} house. As {{we crossed the}} hall Sir Percival came out from the library <b>to</b> meet <b>us.</b> He looked hurried and pale and anxious--but for all that, {{he was in his}} most polite mood when he <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b>|$|R
50|$|When he <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{of notes}} with vibrato or expression, {{he told us}} with a mysterious air that these notes, forte or piano, {{seemed to come from}} within himself. One had the {{impression}} that they came directly from the heart or soul.|$|R
6000|$|That evening, {{the mate}} was {{perfectly}} sober, and coming {{forward to the}} windlass, where we were lounging, summoned aft the doctor, myself, {{and two or three}} others of his favourites; when, in the presence of Bembo the Mowree, he <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> thus: ...|$|R
60|$|We {{all went}} up to Lucy's room. Arthur by {{direction}} remained outside. Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> that was all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] said John, {{with one}} of his quizzing expressions, [...] "Colonel Jarvis, that must be the alderman; they are {{commonly}} colonels of city volunteers: yes, that must have been the old gem'mun who <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> and I was right after all about the bandboxes." ...|$|R
5000|$|His work {{spoke of}} the {{difficulty}} of being, of exile, of solitude. But it also <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> of tenderness, it carried us away in its impulse towards the humiliated, towards all those whom contemporary violence crushed, abandoned.

6000|$|... "I did, but I want {{to point}} out that I came to see you. She walked through the patio, where we {{generally}} sat, and <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> pleasantly, but seldom stopped more than a minute. A matter of politeness, I imagine, and no doubt she'd sooner have stayed away." ...|$|R
60|$|He waved <b>us</b> <b>to</b> seats. We sat down. He <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in French; his English, he remarked, with a {{pleasant}} smile, being a négligeable quantity. We might speak it, he went on; he could understand pretty well; but {{he preferred to}} answer, if we would allow him, in French or German.|$|R
6000|$|A {{few moments}} later we {{returned}} to our seats, while [...] "Wilbur" [...] and [...] "Mitchell" [...] and several other voices <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> Fowler, now that I had admitted telekinesis, {{wanted me to go}} further. [...] "Is the psychic speaking to us," [...] he asked, [...] "or are these voices independent of her?" ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{would not}} have been {{possible}} without the generosity of the 39 Managing Directors who <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> and our team of market researchers. We would also like to thank Brendan McFerran of CAM Benchmarking Ltd for his support for this research and Lynne Rainey for her diligence in the data collection process. Comments on a...|$|R
5000|$|Ralph Waldo Emerson {{said this}} about the Bhagavad Gita: [...] "I owed a {{magnificent}} day to the Bhagavad-Gita. It was as if an empire <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> nothing small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent,the voice of an old intelligence which in another age and climate had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which exercise us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord Shaftesbury was there. He {{came and}} <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> after the concert. Speaking of Miss Greenfield, he said, [...] "I {{consider}} {{the use of}} these halls for the encouragement of an outcast race, a consecration. This is the true use of wealth and splendor when it is employed to raise up and encourage the despised and forgotten." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{captain was}} in the porch, keeping himself {{carefully}} {{out of the way}} of a treacherous shot, should any be intended. He turned and <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> [...] "Doctor's watch on the lookout. Dr. Livesey take the north side, if you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west. The watch below, all hands to load muskets. Lively, men, and careful." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{we arrived}} in Meja, the Serbs stopped us; they wanted money and jewelry. They {{threatened}} my children, even my baby. They had beards, and wore masks. They took our necklaces, rings, earrings, identity papers, even our bags with clothing. They took everything. They threw our clothes in the bushes. They <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> harshly, and slapped one woman.|$|R
60|$|Miss Mills {{was more}} than usually pensive when Dora, going to find her, brought her back;--I apprehend, {{because there was a}} {{tendency}} in what had passed to awaken the slumbering echoes in the caverns of Memory. But she gave us her blessing, and the assurance of her lasting friendship, and <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> generally, as became a Voice from the Cloister.|$|R
6000|$|... [He {{can speak}} with his eyes, his hands, arms, legs, body--nay, [...] with his very bones, for {{he turned the}} broad of his back upon [...] us in [...] "Conrad," [...] the other night, and his shoulder-blades [...] <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> a volume of hesitation, fear, submission, [...] desperation--everything which could haunt {{a man at the}} moment [...] of {{inevitable}} detection.--A [...] "Dramatic Critic."] ...|$|R
60|$|You can fancy, my friends, {{the thrill}} of joy which it gave us when the {{greatest}} man {{in the whole world}} <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in this fashion. Tremeau shook until I thought he would have fallen, and the tears ran down his gigantic moustache. If you had not seen it, you could never believe the influence which the Emperor had upon those coarse-grained, savage old veterans.|$|R
50|$|During {{the nearly}} two years that this series was in {{production}} the DCTV crew were privileged to meet many impressive, thoughtful and articulate people who <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> of Community Education. There is an ongoing, honest and exciting conversation taking place across the centres and offices and classrooms and kitchens that CE inhabits and the sharing and open nature of the practitioners meant that we were welcomed quite quickly into this.|$|R
40|$|Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) {{have been}} gaining {{increasing}} attention as their capabilities are being demonstrated {{in a range}} of applications. One recent advance is the development of a miniaturized QCL, which when used as a light source, enables mid-infrared (mid-IR) scanning speeds much faster than those of conventional Fourier transform IR (FT-IR). Ralf Ostendorf of the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics in Freiburg, Germany, recently <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about this work...|$|R
6000|$|... "`Done,' says I, `that's it;' for ye {{must know}} the poor {{creature}} wos no judge o' meat. He couldn't tell one kind from another, an' he niver axed questions. In fact he niver a-most <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> all the trip. Well, we cut up {{the horse and}} carried the flesh and marrow-bones into camp, takin' care to leave the hoofs and skin behind, and sot to work and roasted steaks and marrow-bones.|$|R
50|$|He <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{at length}} about all that he owed to our mother, all that she had brought to him which he had never known in his life before, and about all {{that she had been}} <b>to</b> him. He <b>spoke</b> while he walked, and this allowed him to {{overcome}} his reserve and his intense shyness. Did he sense then that he had not long to live? I am tempted to believe it and to think that he was asking <b>us</b> <b>to</b> take care of our mother when he could no longer be with her.|$|R

Moreover, he <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about his vision of the Promised Land, a land of justice and equality, brotherhood and peace. Martin dedicated his life to the goals of peace and unity among all peoples, and perhaps nowhere in the world is there a greater appreciation of the desirability and necessity of peace than in Israel." ...|$|R
50|$|Voices reached us {{across the}} immense place, {{and the sound}} of picks and shovels. We crossed over. Mountains of dirt and rock were piled high near the base of the wall. Climbing these we looked down into two massive pits, ten or fifteen feet deep and fifty yards long, where {{hundreds}} of soldiers and workers were digging in the light of huge fires. A young student <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in German. “The Brotherhood Grave,” he explained.- John Reed, Ten Days that Shook the World.|$|R
