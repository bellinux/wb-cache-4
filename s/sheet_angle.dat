Methods: In vivo dual-phase cardiac DTI with a stimulated echo approach and 3 D tagging was performed in 10 healthy volunteers. The time course of material strain was estimated from the tagging data and used to correct for strain effects in the diffusion weighted acquisition. Mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, helix, transverse and sheet angles were calculated and compared between systole and diastole, with and without strain correction. Data acquired at the systolic sweet spot, where the effects of strain are eliminated, served as a reference. Results: The impact of strain correction on helix angle was small.

The standard deviation of systolic transverse angles was significantly reduced from 35. 9 ± 3. 9 ° to 27. 8 °± 3. 5 ° (p< 0. 001) upon strain-correction indicating more coherent fiber tracks after correction. Myocyte aggregate structure was aligned more longitudinally in systole compared to diastole as reflected by an increased transmural range of helix angles (71. 8 °± 3. 9 ° systole vs. 55. 6 °± 5. 6 °, p< 0. 001 diastole).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the mechanical functions of the cardiac muscle it is important to first understand the microstructure of the tissue. Young et al. (1998) realized that quantitative three-dimensional information about the ventricular myocardium is necessary to analyze myocardial mechanics. They developed a technique using confocal fluorescence laser scanning microscopy to obtain three-dimensional images. While this method worked well in rebuilding the myocardial tissue image by image, it was quite extensive and costly. Costa et al. (1999) developed a method that was used to perform three-dimensional reconstruction as well. Their method, while less expensive and much less time consuming, required sheet assumptions and did not look directly at the cross-fiber plane. From Dr. Criscione's previous work on canines (Ashikaga et al., 2004), we found that the sheet structure can be accurately determined from cross-fiber sections without making any sheet assumptions. We have now expanded on those ideas and created a method to perform the quantitative histological investigation of the rat hearts {{in a way that is}} both timely and cost effective. We developed a processing method that preserves the orientation of the fiber and <b>sheet</b> <b>angles.</b> This method was carried out using plastic embedding since the dehydration process used in paraffin embedding has a tendency to grossly distort tissue. Once the heart was fixed in formalin, we then removed the septum and sliced it several times vertically. This allowed us to image the tissue at several depths and find an average fiber angle for each slice. Next, the specimen was hardened, and the sheet orientation was evaluated using polarized light. Once both fiber and <b>sheet</b> <b>angles</b> were obtained from several depths within the septum, we then constructed a three-dimension model of the wall. This method was both cost effective and less time consuming than previous ones and will be a method that can be used in the future to compare the myocardial tissue of diseased and healthy rat hearts so that we may better understand the mechanical functions of the heart as it remodels due to disease...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation to}} explore {{the characteristics of the}} initial drop screen which was formed by sprinkler heads at low water pressures was carried out. Two commercially available sprinkler heads (with thin and massive frame arms) were modified, {{not only in terms of}} deflector plate design, but also with respect to the orifice diameter, in order to decrease the flow and study the effect on liquid sheet thickness, initial <b>sheet</b> <b>angle,</b> sheet breakup distance and drop size distributions and their correspondence with the existing mathematical models. It was found that the addition of a boss in the sprinkler design had little impact on the average drop size and sheet breakup distance. The presence of the boss was found to influence the initial angle of the liquid sheet, which was in line with findings of previous researches. Longer slots on the deflector plate did not change the initial angle of the sheet considerably, but did result in an earlier sheet breakup and smaller median drop diameter. A drop combustion sub-model was built, introducing two novel parameters: theoretical heat capacity (THC) and evaporate heat capacity (EHC), which could be used for estimating the actual heat capacity of the spray. In combination with the calculated drop size distribution in a spray screen, the combustion sub-model confirmed that sprinkler performance does not depend merely on provided flow, but rather on the drop size and the number of drops in a drop screen.

40|$|Abstract Background Computer {{models of}} the {{electrical}} and mechanical actions of the heart, solved on geometrically realistic domains, are becoming an increasingly useful scientific tool. Construction of these models requires detailed measurement of the microstructural features which impact on {{the function of the}} heart. Currently a few generic cardiac models are in use {{for a wide range of}} simulation problems, and contributions to publicly accessible databases of cardiac structures, on which models can be solved, remain rare. This paper presents to-date the largest database of porcine left ventricular segment microstructural architecture, for use in both electrical and mechanical simulation. Methods Cryosectioning techniques were used to reconstruct the myofibre and myosheet orientations in tissue blocks of size ~ 15 × 15 × 15 mm, taken from the mid-anterior left ventricular freewall, of seven hearts. Tissue sections were gathered on orthogonal planes, and the angles of intersection of myofibres and myosheets with these planes determined automatically with a gradient intensity based algorithm. These angles were then combined to provide a description of myofibre and myosheet variation throughout the tissue, in a form able to be input to biophysically based computational {{models of the}} heart. Results Several microstructural features were common across all hearts. Myofibres rotated through 141 ± 18 ° (mean ± SD) from epicardium to endocardium, in near linear fashion. In the outer two-thirds of the wall sheet angles were predominantly negative, however, in the inner one-third an abrupt change in <b>sheet</b> <b>angle,</b> with reversal in sign, was seen in six of the seven hearts. Two distinct populations of sheets with orthogonal orientations often co-existed, usually with one population dominating. The utility of the tissue structures was demonstrated by simulating the passive and active electrical responses of two of the tissue blocks to current injection. Distinct patterns of electrical response were obtained in the two tissue blocks, illustrating the importance of testing model based predictions on a variety of tissue architectures. Conclusion This study significantly expands the set of geometries on which models of cardiac function can be solved. </p...|$|E

30|$|When angled {{tools are}} used to cut the sheet (see Fig. 1), the {{progressive}} contact between the <b>sheet</b> and the <b>angled</b> tool reduces the required force {{at the expense of}} an increased tool stroke, and as stated by Guimaraes (1988), an increased deformation of the sheared <b>sheet.</b> Rake <b>angles</b> (the rake angle is defined in Fig. 3) up to 2 ° are common in larger shearing equipment, but angles larger than 5 ° are seldom used due to deformations that result in curl, camber, or bow of narrow strips, as discussed by Guimaraes (1988). Tools with rake angles also introduce a force along the tools (z-direction in Fig. 1). Although this force is small compared to forces in the other directions, it may affect the shearing if the equipment has a low stiffness in that direction. V-shaped tools balance the z-directional force and are therefore favorable, compared with unsymmetrical tools.|$|R

Detailed {{descriptions}} of cardiac geometry and architecture {{are necessary for}} examining and understanding structural changes to the myocardium that {{are the result of}} pathologies, for interpreting the results of experimental studies of propagation, and for use as a three-dimensional orthotropically anisotropic model for the computational reconstruc-tion of propagation during arrhythmias. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a means to reconstruct fibre and sheet orientation throughout the ventricles. We reconstruct and quantify canine cardiac architecture in selected regions of the left and right ventricular free walls and the inter-ventricular septum. Fibre inclination angle rotates smoothly through the wall in all regions, from positive in the endocardium to negative in the epicardium. However, fibre transverse and <b>sheet</b> <b>angles</b> show large variability in basal regions. Additionally, regions where two populations (positive and negative) of sheet structure merge are identified. From these data, we conclude that a single DTI-derived atlas model of ventricular architecture should be applicable to modelling propagation in wedges from the equatorial and apical left ventricle, and allow comparisons to experimental studies carried out in wedge preparations. However, due to inter-individual variability in basal regions, a library of individual DTI models of basal wedges or of the whole ventricles will be required...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{estimates}} of left ventricular function {{are important for}} understanding normal cardiac function. In the presence of electrical dyssynchrony and heart failure, substantial remodeling of left ventricular geometry and cellular function occurs, resulting in discoordinate mechanical contraction. However, the determinants of regional left ventricular function during altered electrical activation in the failing heart are unclear. Thus, we sought to investigate the effects of ventricular activation on left ventricular function in dyssynchronously failing hearts. Regional mechanics were measured in the anterolateral left ventricle in open-chest canine hearts. We found that the transmural location of the left ventricular pacing lead and its position {{in relation to the}} baseline activation sequence were important determinants of cardiac function. Specifically, improvements in hemodynamic function increased with activation time at the pacing site during endocardial, but not epicardial, biventricular pacing. At the inner wall, radial strain was increased during local endocardial pacing compared with epicardial pacing. In paced failing ventricles, regional differences in myofiber shortening were observed. End-systolic strains were significantly correlated with peak fiber prestretch. Additionally, the onset of sub-endocardial fiber relengthening and fiber shortening duration increased with local activation time, which may be due differences in fiber length. In model simulations, the effects of fiber length and shortening velocity on differences in fiber shortening magnitude, relengthening onset, and shortening duration were investigated. Removing both length and velocity dependence from the active stress model attenuated these differences, compared to baseline. Finally, we studied the effects of sheet structure and transmural activation sequence on regional function. <b>Sheet</b> <b>angle</b> was less radially oriented in failing hearts, compared with control, resulting in a reduced contribution of sheet extension. In failing hearts, reversal of the transmural activation sequence reduced the absolute magnitudes of sheet thickening and shearing at the inner wall, and altered the relative contributions to end-systolic wall thickening compared with normal. Overall, these findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which the amount of electrical dyssynchrony determines left ventricular function in the failing hear...|$|E

To diagnose and treat CHF effectively {{there is a need}} to understand at the microstructural level, the differences in the response of the myocardium to a change in its mechanical environment. Hence to assess growth and remodeling processes in the myocardium, the fiber and myolaminar structure of two groups of Dahl salt-sensitive rats were compared: low salt (LS) normal controls and a high salt (HS) group with hearts in "transitional eutrophy" defined by normal size and shape but in transition from pressure overload hypertrophy to dilated hypertrophy. To create the HS group with transitional eutrophy, we fed Dahl salt-sensitive rats, a sustained high salt diet from age 6 wks till sacrifice at age 11 - 13 wks. Such rats have a heart that transitions from too thick (pressure overload hypertrophy at about age 9 wks) to too thin (dilated hypertrophy at about age 15 wks to death) with a transitional period (age 11 - 13 wks) having normal size and shape. Fiber angles, sheet angles, number and thickness of sheets were measured in the septum at four transmural quarters (TQ 1 to TQ 4 with TQ 1 being closest to LV and TQ 4 closest to RV). A uniformity index was defined to characterize <b>sheet</b> <b>angle</b> dispersion. Upon comparison to LS controls, the HS group had normal size hearts with normal shape.

In this study, nanoparticles and butanol were blended either separately or together with waste cooking oil biodiesel and neat rape seed oil to investigate {{the impact of these}} additives on the properties and spray characteristics. The investigation comprised of three stages, with each having an effect on how the next stage of the investigation was conducted. Initially, the physicochemical characteristics of 25 ppm, 50 ppm, 75 ppm and 100 ppm concentrations of aluminium oxide and copper oxide nanoparticle blends with fossil diesel, waste cooking oil biodiesel and rapeseed oil were investigated. The results from first stage investigation showed that, in general, blends containing aluminium oxide nanoparticles gave better results for almost all the concentrations when compared with copper oxide nanoparticle blends with the same nanoparticle concentrations. Overall, waste cooking oil biodiesel blended with 100 ppm aluminium oxide nanoparticle showed most promising results like the flash point of 159. 3 °C, kinematic viscosity @ 40 °C of 4. 66 cSt, and gross calorific value of 44. 43 MJ/kg. These values were 61. 6 % higher, 51. 3 % higher and 3. 2 % lower than that of corresponding fossil diesel values. Subsequently, in the second stage of the study, the addition of butanol was investigated to assess its ability to enhance the emulsion of biofuel-nanoparticles blends. Four blends containing 90 % biodiesel & 10 % butanol, and 90 % rapeseed oil & 10 % butanol, with and without 100 ppm Al 2 O 3 were prepared. Results showed that the kinematic viscosity of the fuel blends containing 100 ppm aluminium oxide nanoparticles were decreased by 0. 4 % and 3. 3 %, for 90 % biodiesel & 10 % butanol and 90 % rapeseed oil & 10 % butanol blends respectively, when compared to without the nanoparticles. The results obtained from the second stage of investigation proved that butanol acted as a surfactant and thus addition of butanol helped to improve the properties of the biofuel-nanoparticle blends. In the third stage of the study, the spray characteristics of fossil diesel, biodiesel, biodiesel + 100 ppm aluminium oxide nanoparticles, rapeseed oil, rapeseed oil + 100 ppm aluminium oxide nanoparticles, 90 % biodiesel & 10 % butanol, 90 % biodiesel & 10 % butanol + 100 ppm aluminium oxide nanoparticles, 90 % rapeseed oil & 10 % butanol and 90 % rapeseed oil & 10 % butanol + 100 ppm aluminium oxide nanoparticles were investigated.

40|$|The way {{in which}} the {{myocardium}} responds to its mechanical environment must be understood in order to develop reasonable treatments for congestive heart failure. The first step toward this understanding is to characterize and quantify the cardiac microstructure in healthy and diseased hearts. Myocardium has a laminar architecture made up of myolaminae, which are sheets of myocytes surrounded by a collagen weave. By enhancing the contrast between the myocytes and the surrounding collagen, the myocardium can be investigated and its laminar structure can be quantified. Many of the techniques that have been used to view the microstructure of the heart require the use of toxic or caustic chemicals for fixation or staining. An efficient imaging method that uses polarization microscopy and enhances the contrast between the collagen and myocytes while minimizing the use of harmful chemicals was developed in this research. Collagen is birefringent; therefore its visibility should be enhanced through polarization microscopy and image processing. The <b>sheet</b> <b>angles</b> were viewed directly by cutting slices of a rat septum perpendicular to the fiber angle. Images of different polarization combinations were taken and a region of interest was selected on the sample.

In this study, {{the effect of adding}} bulking agents with various alkyl chain lengths (C 14, C 18, and C 22) on the bulk of paper, the sizing performance, and sheet wettability was evaluated. The bulking effect of a bulking agent with a short alkyl chain length (C 14) was large, and reduction in the sheet tensile strength was confirmed to be suppressed. Good sheet sizing performance was achieved when a bulking agent was used with an alkyl ketene dimer (AKD). When 0.1 % or more of AKD was added, using a bulking agent with a shorter alkyl chain length increased the improvement in the sizing degree. Pyrolysis gas chromatography measurements of the amount of reacted AKD revealed that the {{addition of}} a bulking agent increased the AKD content of the sheet. The <b>sheet</b> contact <b>angle</b> measured by the two-liquid method tended to increase with increasing alkyl chain length.

The Stöckigt sizing degree of paper sheets was found to be greatly influenced by the sheet wettability by NH 4 SCN solution. In the case of 2 % NH 4 SCN aqueous solution, different samples exhibited large wettability differences.

That gave average x-y distributions of the flaring angle between B(sub xy) and the x direction, as well as that angle's variation across the thickness of the plasma <b>sheet.</b> <b>Angles</b> obtained in the central plasma sheet differed from those derived near the lobe boundary. That is the expected signature if earthward or tailward Birkeland current sheets are embedded in the plasma sheet, and from this dfiference we derived the dawn-dusk profiles of the tail Birkeland currents for several x(sub GSM) intervals. It was found that (1) the Birkeland currents have the sense of region 1 currents, when mapped to the ionosphere; (2) both the linear current density (kiloamperes/R(sub E)) and the net magnitude of the field-aligned currents decrease rapidly down the tail; (3) the total Birkeland current at x approximately equals - 10 R(sub E) equals approximately equals 500 - 700 kA, which is approx. 30 % of the net region 1 current observed at ionospheric altitudes, in agreement with model mapping results; and (4) the B(sub z) and B(sub y) components of the interplanetary magnetic field influence the distribution of Birkeland currents in the tail...|$|R
30|$|Three-dimensional {{nonlinear}} transient thermo-mechanical {{finite element}} method based numerical model is developed for the laser bending process. Coupled thermo-mechanical analysis is carried out by employing various input process parameters such as worksheet geometry, material properties, laser process parameters and the absorptivity. The computed plastic strains are used to obtain the deformation in the work <b>sheets.</b> The bend <b>angle</b> was computed by measuring distorted coordinates on the deformed work sheets.The details of the numerical model are presented below.|$|R
50|$|Draft - Those {{triangular}} sails {{that are}} attached to both a mast along the luff and a boom along the foot have depth, called draft, which results from the luff and foot being curved, rather than straight as they {{are attached to}} those spars. Draft creates a more efficient airfoil shape for the sail. Draft can also be induced in triangular staysails by adjustment of the <b>sheets</b> and the <b>angle</b> from which they reach the sails.|$|R

The wing had a 5 -percent thick symmetric diamond cross section beveled to {{a knife edge}} at the tip. At small angles of attack, downwash angles were {{in close agreement with}} predictions of linearized theory based on the assumption of an undistorted vortex <b>sheet.</b> At higher <b>angles</b> of attack, the flow was greatly influenced by the rolling up of the vortex sheet...|$|R
40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2007 Every day, the Pathology Department at the University of Michigan Hospital generates and {{receives}} a large quantity of anatomic pathology samples {{in the form}} of glass slides for light microscopy. The slides are used by pathologists to arrive at diagnoses for patients who have undergone diagnostic biopsies or surgical excisions of a variety of tissues or organs. These slides are currently stored in a very primitive drawer system that has not changed for decades. Our project was to modernize this system by optimizing the slide storage density, fixing current design problems, and designing to allow for easy adaptation to an automated slide retrieval system. Through our engineering analysis, we were able to determine the best shape and size to maximize the density based on set ergonomic and material constraints. For the fabrication of our prototype we decided to use low carbon steel <b>sheet</b> and <b>angle</b> steel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{manufacturing}} {{technique of}} driving {{is one of}} the oldest procedures for sheet metal forming and has been used in the ancient world for the production of copper pots and vases. This technique is still utilized for niche applications but today has lost its importance. The process of driving is almost completely carried out manually and thus is only appropriate for very small quantities or in case of failure of other production processes. Since individualization of products is strongly gaining in significance, forming processes have to be found, which are independent from expensive tools and equipment. Using driving as the process of choice to form sheet metal, the grade of automation of the forming process has to be increased. Numerically controlled driving, i. e. automated positioning and handling of the work piece during the production process, will need a conclusive simulation base. This paper provides results of the analysis of <b>sheet</b> steel <b>angles</b> formed by the driving sub groups of shrinking and stretching...|$|R
40|$|The heliospheric {{modulation}} {{strength is}} a good parameter for the long-term modulation of cosmic rays in the neutron monitor energy range. Here we study an empirical relation between the modulation strength and the global heliospheric parameters: the heliospheric current <b>sheet</b> tilt <b>angle,</b> the open solar magnetic flux and the global IMF polarity. The suggested relation closely reproduces the measured annual NM count rates. Using the measured IMF parameters and the modulation strength values computed since 1951, this relation allows us to reconstruct the annual tilt angle for about 25 years before the time of direct measurements of the tilt angle. In addition to more sophisticated theoretical models of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) modulation it is also useful to study empirical regression models. Usually such models linearly relate various heliospheric parameters to the GCR intensity at a fixed energy (see, e. g., [2]). Here we try to generalize this approach. A general parameter of the heliospheric modulation of GCR is the modulatio...|$|R
