5|$|A Scottish crest badge is a heraldic badge worn to show {{allegiance}} {{to an individual}} or membership in a specific Scottish clan. Crest badges are commonly called clan crests, {{but this is a}} misnomer; there is no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a collective clan crest, just as there is no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a clan coat of arms.|$|E

5|$|Catherine {{states that}} Northanger Abbey looks exactly as she {{imagined}} {{it and she}} becomes intrigued by Mrs. Tilney's death. Due to her overactive imagination, Catherine starts to believe that General Tilney murdered his wife. Henry catches her in his mother's chamber and becomes offended when he realises what she has been thinking. Catherine apologises and Henry tells her that perhaps {{it is possible to}} read too many novels. Catherine receives a letter from James, in which he reveals that his engagement to Isabella has been called off, because she allowed Frederick to seduce her. Eleanor explains to Catherine that her brother has no intention of marrying Isabella. Catherine gets a letter from Isabella, asking her to apologise to James for her, but Catherine states that she will do no <b>such</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Louisville {{returned}} on offense, {{needing to}} score quickly, make {{a stop on}} defense, then score a second {{time to take the}} lead. The energized Tech defense was disinclined to allow any <b>such</b> <b>thing.</b> Though Cantwell completed two short passes for 16yards and a first down, he was sacked on first down and the Tech defense prevented him from completing another pass. Two passes were knocked down by Hokie defenders, while another fell short. After Louisville failed to convert a fourth down, Virginia Tech took over on offense. The Hokies proceeded to run out the clock, executing two short rushes and an incomplete pass. Louisville had one final chance on offense after a Tech punt, but three consecutive desperation Hail Mary passes were unsuccessful. Two fell incomplete, and the third was intercepted by Tech cornerback Brandon Flowers. With time almost gone, Tech finished running out the clock and secured the victory. As time expired, Virginia Tech held a 35–24 lead and won the 2006 Gator Bowl.|$|E

5|$|While {{many critics}} refer to film noir as a genre itself, {{others argue that}} it can be no <b>such</b> <b>thing.</b> While noir is often {{associated}} with an urban setting, many classic noirs take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road; setting, therefore, cannot be its genre determinant, as with the Western. Similarly, while the private eye and the femme fatale are character types conventionally identified with noir, the majority of film noirs feature neither; so there is no character basis for genre designation as with the gangster film. Nor does film noir rely on anything as evident as the monstrous or supernatural elements of the horror film, the speculative leaps of the science fiction film, or the song-and-dance routines of the musical.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween, Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is carving a jack-o'-lantern while {{preparing}} {{to take his}} daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) trick-or-treating. As he leaves to collect her, he notices a demonic figure watching him from across the street. That night, Jordan deliberately passes by one house, telling Black that it is haunted. Black tells her there are no <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as ghosts, but is reminded of a moment from his past. In a flashback, we see a five-year-old Black being dared by his friends to knock {{the door of the}} same house; a man named Crocell (Dean Winters) answers and invites Black inside. Crocell is a Second World War veteran, and he explains the meaning of Halloween to Black, telling the boy that it is the one night of the year that ghosts walk among the living. Crocell hopes that it is his chance to commune with the friends he lost in the war, and is dismayed when the young Black dismisses the possibility of ghosts.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from his {{director and the}} exhibit's drug manufacturer sponsor, Burton steals Zero's medical records in hopes of discovering new information. Zero and Burton examine an old blood sample of Zero's under a microscope and discover Miss HIV (Michael Callen), who {{points out that the}} original study that was used to label Patient Zero as the first person to bring HIV to North America did not prove any <b>such</b> <b>thing,</b> but instead helped prove that HIV was sexually transmitted, leading to the development of safer sex practices. Under this interpretation, Zero could be lauded as a hero for his candor in participating in that original study. As Burton ponders this, an unknown fluid squirts from the eye pieces of the microscope, drenching Zero and making him appear on video. He joyously declares his innocence on tape but the effect only lasts five minutes before he fades away again. Zero angrily accuses Burton of not caring for him at all and only wanting to use him for the exhibit, then storms out.|$|E

Bahá'u'lláh also writes about general principles including statements telling his followers to work with people of all religions with amity, and warns his followers to guard against <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as fanaticism and pride.
