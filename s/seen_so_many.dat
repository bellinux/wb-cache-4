25|$|Jiménez de Quesada left Bogotá {{and went}} to Coçontá (Chocontá), that he called Valle del Spiritusancto. From there he went to Turmequé in a valley he named Valle de la Trompeta, {{the first of the}} Tunja lands. From Turmequé he send his men to {{discover}} the emerald mines and after that leaving for another valley, of San Juan, in Muysccubun called Tenesucha and from there to the valley of Somondoco where he spoke to the cacique Sumindoco, who governed the mines or quarries of emeralds and was subject to the gran cacique of Tunja. Many emeralds were extracted. He decided to continue to search for the cacique of Tunja, who was at war with the Christians. The document describes the lands of Tunja as richer than those of Bogotá, although those were already rich, but gold and precious emeralds are more abundant in Tunja. In total 1800 emeralds, large and small were found and De Quesada had never <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> and precious ones in his life. The rich resources of Peru are described in relation to the mines of Tunja, where the emeralds were more numerous than in Peru. Epítome describes the process of extracting the emeralds with wooden sticks from the veins in the rocks. From the emerald mines of Tunja, he returned to Bogotá.|$|E

Said Jones, [...] "I've never <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> great performers come together with so much love and selflessness." [...] The celebration included a performance of [...] "We Are the World", which involved Clinton, his daughter Chelsea, and his wife Hillary singing the song along with USA for Africa's Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross and Michael Jackson.

500|$|The {{series was}} tied at three wins apiece {{and a tie}} {{entering}} the eighth and deciding game, with millions of Canadians watching [...] "the game of the century". With the game tied at five late in the third, the Soviets were met with a concerted Canadian attack in the final seven minutes. [...] With 34 seconds remaining in the game, Esposito took a shot at Vladislav Tretiak from 12 feet out. Paul Henderson scooped up the rebound and put it past the fallen Soviet goalie to score the goal that won the game, 6–5, and the series. [...] Later, Alexander Yakolev, the former Soviet ambassador to Canada, argued that the Summit Series planted the seeds of glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union, as {{it was one of}} the first times that the Soviet people had <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> foreigners who had not come to do harm, but to share in the game.|$|E
500|$|In this episode, {{the sports}} {{announcer}} states {{he had not}} seen a [...] "beating like that since Rodney King", referencing to an incident in 1991 where King was beaten by six LAPD police officers. The incident sparked tensions in LA that eventually led to the 1992 LA Riots. When Pip is tackled later, the commentator states that he has not seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant. This references Grant's arrest in June 1995, when he was caught performing a lewd act in public with a Hollywood prostitute. Grant was fined $1,180, placed on probation for two years, and was ordered to complete an AIDS education program. The announcer makes an incomplete remark about a tackle, [...] "I haven't <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> children molested since...". This was rumored to have been followed by a line, [...] "since Michael Jackson came to town", which was supposedly censored after the broadcast premiere, but {{there is no evidence of}} this.|$|E

In the episode, Homer, Bart, and Lisa visit a video game convention called the Expensive Electronic Entertainment Expo (E4), which is {{a reference to the}} Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that is presented annually in the United States by the Entertainment Software Association. This marked {{the first time that the}} family visited a video game convention in The Simpsons. Selman and other staff members on the show had previously visited E3 during the release of The Simpsons video games such as The Simpsons Game. While appearing on GameTrailers TV with Geoff Keighley on November 11, 2011, Selman commented that [...] "We've been to so many [...] and we've been pushed around, and knocked around, and <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> PR guys [...] about how hard it was working on their game.

500|$|Bryant {{became the}} butt of jokes on {{television}} shows and film, even by former colleague Bob Hope. Everywhere she went {{in the days after}} the vote she was met with noisy protests: Norfolk, Virginia—where demonstrators interrupted her presentation so forcefully she began crying—Chicago, and dozens of other cities. The Ku Klux Klan appeared at one of Bryant's appearances in Huntington, West Virginia claiming they were there to protect her. She attracted the largest gay demonstration in Canadian history when she appeared at a Toronto religious performance. Though she performed and spoke only at revivals and other religious shows, audiences were often less than half the expected number, and many would leave when she came on stage. In Houston Bryant was invited to perform for the Texas State Bar Association two weeks after the Dade County vote. With no cohesive political community, a few gay organizers invited people to protest her appearance at the Hyatt Regency. An organizer estimated for police that 500people might participate, but guessed because no gay community had responded to a cause before; police prepared for that number. However, thousands of people swarmed around the hotel chanting loudly enough to drown Bryant's performance; a conservative estimate of the participants' numbers was 2,000. The audience inside could not hear Bryant, and at one point attorneys working with the American Civil Liberties Union walked out and joined the protesters. One of the organizers said that he had never <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> gay people in one place before, and then made a speech thanking Bryant: [...] "If God in his infinite wisdom had not created Anita Bryant, we would have had to invent her". He claimed the protest had the same result in Houston as the Stonewall riots.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXII" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology was positive {{and gave the}} episode a rating of seven out of ten, but commented that he preferred [...] "episodes that feature longer, more involved storylines more than the spoof collections." [...] At The A.V. Club, Hayden Childs gave the episode a C+ grade, saying, [...] "The writers seem unwilling to mock the more outrageous aspects of the movies they are sending up and settle for weakly batting at the obvious. Some of the jokes land, but none land too solidly." [...] Meredith Woerner of io9 thought that [...] "he whole thing never quite achieved {{the same level of}} brilliance as some previous years — even though the Avatar bit was funny, we've <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> Avatar spoofs by now that, well, it's tired. However we did get a lot of joy out of seeing Homer dressed up as Doctor Manhattan and Maggie as a wee-little chest burster." [...] Even more critical was CraveOnline's Blair Marnell who gave the episode a rating of three out of ten. He commented that [...] "there is no stronger argument for ending 'The Simpsons' than the latest Halloween installment of 'Treehouse of Horror'" [...] and further said that [...] "in all honesty, it's amazing how tame 'The Simpsons' has become over the years. This show used to be the 'South Park' of its day. Now it's just showing its age and it's no longer the cool TV rebel that it used to be." [...] Alex Strachan had the opposite reaction in a review in Calgary Herald and concluded that we should [...] "orget all that talk about The Simpsons being past its prime. Based on tonight's sharp-eyed, keen-witted Treehouse of Horror XXII - funnier, faster and more fright-worthy than last year's dud, thankfully - there's a lot of ink left in the old ink pot yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Robert Craft, Stravinsky {{remained}} a confirmed monarchist {{throughout his life}} and loathed the Bolsheviks from the very beginning. In 1930, he remarked, [...] "I don't believe that anyone venerates Mussolini more than I ... I know many exalted personages, and my artist's mind does not shrink from political and social issues. Well, after having <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> events and so many more or less representative men, I have an overpowering urge to render homage to your Duce. He is the saviour of Italy and – let us hope – Europe". Later, after a private audience with Mussolini, he added, [...] "Unless my ears deceive me, the voice of Rome {{is the voice of}} Il Duce. I told him that I felt like a fascist myself... In spite of being extremely busy, Mussolini did me the great honour of conversing with me for three-quarters of an hour. We talked about music, art and politics". When the Nazis placed Stravinsky's works on the list of [...] "Entartete Musik", he lodged a formal appeal to establish his Russian genealogy and declared, [...] "I loathe all communism, Marxism, the execrable Soviet monster, and also all liberalism, democratism, atheism, etc." [...] Towards the end of his life, at Craft's behest, Stravinsky made a return visit to his native country and composed a cantata in Hebrew, travelling to Israel for its performance.|$|E

2500|$|At 15:38, Egyptian radar {{installations}} {{informed the}} EAF command {{that a second}} wave of around 16 Israeli aircraft was coming from over the Mediterranean at very low altitude. The Egyptians scrambled a final eight MiG-21s at Mansoura, while eight MiG-21s from the Abu Hamad air base were called upon to assist. The ensuing air battle was intense, involving large numbers of aircraft; at one point, the battle involved 62 MiG-21s and some 120 Phantoms and A-4 Skyhawks. A few Israeli fighter-bombers reached their target and [...] bombed the runway and the air defenses around the air base. While the final eight aircraft from Mansoura took off, Israeli aircraft were approaching to make their bombing run. Nasr Mousa, piloting {{one of the eight}} MiG-21s, spotted an Israeli Phantom lining up against him. Mousa made a sudden, hard right-hand turn that put him on the Phantom's tail. He shot down the Phantom with cannon fire, and no parachutes emerged. Medhat 'Arafa, an Egyptian pilot, recalls [...] "the battle was a frightening sight because I had never <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> aeroplanes in one area. We were not only dogfighting, but also warning other pilots that they had an enemy on their tail..." [...] The Israeli Phantoms had to abandon their bomb-loads in order to dogfight with the more maneuverable MiG aircraft. Egyptian pilots had to land their aircraft, re-arm, refuel and take-off again within a period of seven minutes. Take-off usually took three minutes, but according to Naser, the pilots were able to accomplish it in one-and-a-half minutes during the air battle.|$|E

Blondie and Tuco have an ambivalent partnership. Tuco knows {{the name of the}} cemetery where the gold is hidden, but Blondie knows the name of the grave where it is buried, forcing them to work together to find the treasure. In spite of this greedy quest, Blondie's pity for the dying soldiers in the chaotic carnage of the War is evident. [...] "I've never <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> men wasted so badly," [...] he remarks. He also comforts a dying soldier by laying his coat over him and letting him smoke his cigar. Rawhide had ended its run as a series in 1966, and at that point neither A Fistful of Dollars nor For a Few Dollars More had been released in the United States. When Leone offered Clint Eastwood a role in his next movie, it was the only big film offer he had; however, Eastwood still needed to be convinced to do it. Leone and his wife traveled to California to persuade him. Two days later, he agreed to make the film upon being paid $250,000 and getting 10% of the profits from the North American markets—a deal with which Leone was not happy. In the original Italian script for the film, he is named [...] "Joe" [...] (his nickname in A Fistful of Dollars), but is referred to as Blondie in the Italian and English dialogue.|$|E
