Two levels of both sodium chloride (0. 4 and 2 %) and barley malt (0. 8 and 5 %) were added to the unextruded corn flour whereas six levels of sucrose (from 3 to 10 %) were used. Addition of <b>sucrose</b> at <b>lowest</b> salt <b>content</b> (0. 4 %) as well as addition of salt, either at 0. 4 and 2 %, led to a significant decrease of FB 1 levels in extruded samples whereas malt, either at 0. 8 and 5 %, did not significantly affect FB 1 stability.

30|$|Our {{metabolomic}} {{analysis showed}} {{that the lack of}} GS 1; 2 decreases both nitrogen- and carbon metabolites (sucrose and glucose 6 -phosphate) in the basal portions of rice shoots at the seedling stage (Figs.  1 and 2; Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). The decrease in glucose 6 -phosphate content may have been caused by the decrease in sucrose. The decrease in sucrose content was successfully restored to wild-type levels by complementation (Fig. 2). The reductions in sucrose and nitrogen metabolism found here corroborated the previous transcriptomic analysis (Ohashi et al. 2015 b). Downregulation of the genes associated with nitrogen and carbon metabolism were observed in the basal portions of the gs 1; 2 mutant shoots. The lack of GS 1; 2 significantly downregulated OscFBP 2 expression in the basal portions of the shoots (Ohashi et al. 2015 b) (Fig. 3). The expression level of OscFBP 2 was dominant relative to the other isogenes in the basal portions of the shoots (Fig. 3). The lack of GS 1; 2 also reduced OscFBP 2 expression signals in the phloem companion cells of the nodal vascular anastomoses, the internodal parenchyma cells, and the lower leaf sheath regions in the basal portions of the shoots (Fig. 4). The importance of cFBPase in sucrose biosynthesis has been established (Strand et al. 2000). The cFBPase antisense mutants of Arabidopsis presented with reduced shoot growth and sucrose content compared to the wild type (Strand et al. 2000). Rice mutants lacking cFBPase 2 were isolated to determine whether OscFBP 2 downregulation was responsible for the <b>low</b> <b>sucrose</b> <b>content.</b> Oscfbp 2 mutants, which cannot translate functional cFBPase 2 protein, displayed <b>low</b> <b>sucrose</b> <b>content</b> in the basal portions of their shoots (Fig. 6; Additional file 4 : Figure S 4). This phenotype resembled that of the gs 1; 2 mutants (Figs. 1 and 2; Additional file 1 : Figure S 1.). Therefore, <b>low</b> <b>sucrose</b> metabolism in the basal portions of the gs 1; 2 mutant shoots was largely caused by OscFBP 2 downregulation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{physiological}} basis for variation in sucrose content among sugarcane clones despite substantial research at the molecular and biochemical levels. We used irrigation and continuous monitoring of photosynthesis and plant extension rate to modify dry matter partitioning in four clones differing widely in sucrose content. Three pot experiments were conducted on two <b>low</b> <b>sucrose</b> <b>content</b> clones, KQ 97 - 2599 and KQ 97 - 2835, and two high sucrose content clones,Q 117 andKQ 97 - 5080, in a temperature-controlled glasshouse. As expected, sucrose content on a dry mass basis of whole stalks was greater in high (55 % maximum) than in <b>low</b> <b>sucrose</b> clones (40 % maximum), but sucrose content in the two clones selected for <b>low</b> <b>sucrose</b> reached 55 % in some internodes. Differences between clones in whole-plant net photosynthesis and aerial biomass accumulation were small. However, biomass was distributed over fewer stalks in the high sucrose clones (4 – 7 stalks per pot) than in the <b>low</b> <b>sucrose</b> clones (9 – 11 stalks per pot). The high sucrose clones also allocated a considerably greater proportion of drymatter to the stalk (70 %maximum) than the <b>low</b> <b>sucrose</b> clones (60 %maximum). It is suggested that the relatively large amount of new leaf tissue produced by the high tillering, <b>low</b> <b>sucrose</b> clones placed an additional demand for structural photo-assimilate in these clones and delayed the accumulation of sucrose in the stalk. The results indicated that there is little direct genetic control on themaximumamount of sucrose that can accumulate in stalk tissue and that genetic contrasts in sucrose content reside more in the morphology of the plant and responses t...|$|R

30|$|Rice mutants lacking cFBPase 1 {{presented}} with severe reductions in growth, tiller number, and sugar (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) {{levels in the}} leaf blades (Lee et al. 2008; Koumoto et al. 2013). OscFBP 1 was significantly more expressed than OscFBP 2 in the leaves, roots, flowers, and seeds (Lee et al. 2008). Compared with cFBPase 1 deficiency, the lack of cFBPase 2 may have only a limited role in tiller growth at the early growth stage. Kebrom et al. (2012) indicated that in wheat, the suppression of axillary bud outgrowth {{is associated with a}} reduction in <b>sucrose</b> <b>content.</b> <b>Low</b> <b>sucrose</b> levels may, in turn, reduce the expression of sucrose-inducible genes involved in the synthesis, gap 2 -mitosis, and cytokinesis phases of the cell cycle. Axillary buds were rapidly released in intact Arabidopsis plants supplemented with exogenous sucrose (Mason et al. 2014). Therefore, sucrose may serve as an important cue for axillary bud outgrowth. Reduction in tiller number at the early growth stage in the absence of cFBPase 2 indicates that OscFBP 2 downregulation delayed tiller development at the early growth stages of gs 1; 2 mutants via <b>low</b> <b>sucrose</b> availability. Early anatomical analyses reported that normal tiller development in rice depends on adequate nitrogen and carbohydrate (sugars and/or starch) levels in the basal portions of the shoots (Takahashi et al. 1956; Sato, 1959). Previous research has shown that the glutamine generated from the GS 1; 2 reactions contributes to tiller outgrowth via glutamine-dependent cytokinin synthesis (Ohashi et al. 2017). The findings of the present study indicated that adequate supplies of both glutamine and sucrose are required for rice tiller growth because they function as nutrients and signaling molecules in the basal portions of the shoots.|$|R

The content of reducing sugars was {{higher than that of}} sucrose, and it appeared to be higher in shoots cultured under natural ventilation compared to those in closed vessels. Somatic embryogenesis and root regeneration were influenced by stage I and II treatments.

This paper presents {{the outcome of the}} first to third ratoon crops of 16 contrasting varieties grown at Reduit (1500 mm rainfall) with supplementary irrigation to contain water stress and its resulting impact on dry matter partitioning. Based on the proven parameter pol % dry matter of the cane portion (P%CDM) early in the season (April), four variety types were identified, namely Early with a P%CDM above 42 %, Intermediate-Early with P%CDM between 40 and 42 %, Intermediate-Late P%CDM between 30 and 40 % and Late P%CDM below 30 %. Compared to the late group, the early group tended to produce fewer tillers with smaller leaf area indices resulting in lower biomass accumulation potential. They, however, exhibited better partitioning efficiencies when allocating total biomass to cane as well as when allocating cane biomass to stored sucrose. The contrast between early and late varieties proves that varieties can be bred for both the early part as well as the late part of the harvest season, such that extension of the season with varieties combining yield and quality can be contemplated...|$|R

More than 50, 000, 000 pair-end clean reads for each library were generated. When taproot turned into the rapid growth stage at the growth stage of 82 days after emergence (DAE), eighteen enriched gene ontology (GO) terms, including cell wall, cytoskeleton, and enzyme linked receptor protein signaling pathway, occurred in both cultivars. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of paired comparison in both cultivars were enriched in the cell wall GO term. For pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs that were respectively generated at 82 DAE compared to 59 DAE (the earlier developmental stage before taproot turning into the rapid growth stage), plant hormone signal transduction pathway was enriched. At 82 DAE, the rapid enlarging stage of taproot, several transcription factor family members were up-regulated in both cultivars. An antagonistic expression of brassinosteroid- and auxin-related genes was also detected. In SD 13829, the growth strategy was relatively focused on cell enlargement promoted by brassinosteroid signaling, whereas in BS 02, it was relatively focused on secondarily cambial cell division regulated by cytokinin, auxin and brassinosteroid signaling.

The ability to recover completely from dehydration has been attributed {{in part to the}} ability of the plant to accumulate large quantities of sucrose. The accumulation of sucrose stabilises membranes, protects proteins and contributes to cellular osmoregulation during water stress. However, it has been observed in C. wilmsii by research group of Farrant (unpublished) that sucrose accumulations differ significantly when dehydration is carried out in the light and the dark. Farrant (unpublished) observed a significant increase in sucrose accumulation when dehydration was carried in light while dehydration in the dark resulted in very <b>low</b> amount of <b>sucrose.</b> Based on these findings, using the plant C. plantagineum, metabolic factors, which could contribute to differences, observed in C. wilmsii for sucrose accumulation in both light and dark was examined in this project. To achieve this, three enzymes in relation to sucrose accumulation from leaves dried in both light and dark treatments were examined, namely: hexokinase, acid invertase and aldolase. The amount of glucose, fructose and sucrose during the dehydration process in both light and dark treatments were also examined. Results obtained show a significant decrease in sucrose (9. 8 -fold decrease) when tissues of C. plantagineum where dried in the dark as opposed to the light. Furthermore, the amount of hexose sugars was also significantly lower in dark dehydrated tissues. Moreover, the enzyme data for dark dehydrated samples showed that both aldolase and hexokinase activity levels were significantly low. In contrast, enzyme data for the light dehydrated tissues showed that aldolase and hexokinase activities were maintained, although a higher level of aldolase activity was recorded, until approximately 10 % RWC where a drop-in activity was recorded for both enzyme. However, acid invertase activity was comparable for both light and dark dehydrated tissues. Thus, it seems that the down regulation of aldolase during dehydration in the dark might be responsible for the <b>low</b> <b>sucrose</b> <b>content</b> obtained in the dark for C. plantagineum...|$|R
