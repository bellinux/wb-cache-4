5|$|During battle, {{the player}} can {{converse}} with enemies, {{though they are}} restricted to a single set of dialogue options instead of four as in the original Persona. If the player succeeds in talking with the enemy using the right character, it both causes the enemy to leave the battlefield and gains a <b>spell</b> card (a Tarot card linked {{to one of the}} Arcanum or family of Personas), which can be used to create Personas in a location called the Velvet Room. In the Velvet Room, the player can summon a new Persona that belongs to a <b>spell</b> card's particular Persona family group. As a character gains experience levels, more powerful Personas from a <b>spell</b> card's group become available. In addition to pre-set <b>spell</b> cards, the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation. These blank skill cards can be tailored to fit a chosen Persona family.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of two studies on the <b>spelling</b> {{performance}} of 1 st graders in a transparent writing system. The <b>spelling</b> performance of Italian children was assessed to determine the cross-task relationship between <b>spelling</b> to dictation and spontaneous <b>spelling</b> at the single word level (Study 1) and at the text level (Study 2), respectively. In study 1, 132 Italian children's <b>spelling</b> performance was assessed in 1 st grade through two standardized tasks, i. e., word dictation, and spontaneous word <b>spelling.</b> In study 2, <b>spelling</b> performance of 81 Italian children was assessed in 1 st grade through two tasks, i. e., text dictation, and spontaneous text <b>spelling.</b> In Study 1, <b>spelling</b> words and pseudo-words to dictation {{was found to be}} more difficult than spontaneous <b>spelling</b> of words. This effect was verified for all children (including low achievers and <b>spelling</b> impaired). The moderate correlation found between <b>spelling</b> to dictation and spontaneous <b>spelling</b> indicated that the two tasks are supported by partially different <b>spelling</b> processes and confirmed suggestions for including both types of <b>spelling</b> assessments in the school. In Study 2, children's <b>spelling</b> performances were not dependent across the two tasks (i. e., <b>spelling</b> a text under dictation or spontaneously). The two tasks shared the level of difficulty but performance in one task was not predictive of performance in the second task. Strong individual differences between children were found at the text level as a function of task. Similar to Study 1, the moderate correlation between <b>spelling</b> text to dictation and spontaneous <b>spelling</b> confirmed the usefulness of adopting both <b>spelling</b> assessments at school...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{designed}} to teach <b>spelling</b> {{based on the assumption}} that <b>spelling</b> is a memorization (as opposed to rule-based) task. The program presents a series of <b>spelling</b> words within sentences, and then requires the learner to type in the <b>spelling</b> words. In [...] "learning" [...] mode, the program would ignore incorrect letters, with the idea being that seeing an incorrect <b>spelling</b> on the screen would interfere with memorizing a correct <b>spelling.</b> (The user could continually guess at the next correct letter or press ESC to show the correct <b>spelling.)</b> Misspelled words are presented again to learners, who must retype <b>spelling</b> words until they are <b>spelled</b> correctly. The program periodically presents <b>spelling</b> words from previous lessons to reinforce memoirization.|$|R
5|$|At the school, Ged's skills inspire admiration {{among the}} {{teachers}} {{as well as}} students. He befriends an older student named Vetch, but generally remains aloof from his fellows.

He casts a powerful <b>spell</b> intended to raise {{the spirit of a}} dead woman, but the <b>spell</b> goes awry and releases a shadow creature, which attacks Ged and scars his face.

50|$|The {{key element}} of the game are the Wizards. Wizards are very {{powerful}} at magic, but rather weak at close combat. Every player has one Wizard, each with a sphere of magic (Life, Death, Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Cosmos and finally Chaos/Secret), which decides which <b>spells</b> the Wizard can research. Some Wizards have multiple spheres, but can only learn less advanced <b>spells.</b> <b>Spells</b> range from passive <b>spells</b> (for instance, blessing a unit with additional strengths), to direct <b>spells</b> (i.e. healing <b>spells</b> or attack <b>spells),</b> to summoning <b>spells.</b> Wizards are the only units in the game who can't level up or gain medals. Instead, they improve by researching new <b>spells</b> and skills.|$|R
40|$|This poster {{introduces}} research based {{information for}} teaching <b>spelling</b> in the classroom. The {{focus of the}} poster further explains “Why is <b>spelling</b> important?” and “How <b>spelling</b> can be effectively implemented into the classroom?” Research was conducted by examining multiple media sources such as textbooks, journal articles, and online databases using the keywords: <b>spelling,</b> strategies, and interventions. The reviewed research showed that <b>spelling</b> correlates with reading, writing, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. Research-based strategies that are effective in the primary classroom include weekly <b>spelling</b> stories, <b>spelling</b> magnet boards, and various <b>spelling</b> games. Incorporating fun word games into a daily or weekly routine helps to reinforce/improve effective <b>spelling</b> habits. A variety of techniques are used to assess <b>spelling.</b> It is important to supplement the assessment with student work to get an accurate picture of a student’s <b>spelling</b> abilities and limitations. It {{is essential for the}} teacher to create an effective environment in the classroom to support <b>spelling.</b> An effective environment includes many opportunities for students to practice strategies they have learned and for the teacher to conduct ongoing <b>spelling</b> assessments...|$|R

40|$|The task of {{recognition}} of oral <b>spelling</b> (stimulus: “C-A-T”, response: “cat”) is often administered to individuals with acquired written language disorders, {{yet there is}} no consensus about the underlying cognitive processes. We adjudicate between two existing hypotheses: Recognition of oral <b>spelling</b> uses central reading processes, or recognition of oral <b>spelling</b> uses central <b>spelling</b> processes in reverse. We tested the recognition of oral <b>spelling</b> and <b>spelling</b> to dictation abilities of a single individual with acquired dyslexia and dysgraphia. She was impaired relative to matched controls in <b>spelling</b> to dictation but unimpaired in recognition of oral <b>spelling.</b> Recognition of oral <b>spelling</b> for exception words (e. g., colonel) and pronounceable nonwords (e. g., larth) was intact. Our results were predicted by the hypothesis that recognition of oral <b>spelling</b> involves the central reading processes. We conclude that recognition of oral <b>spelling</b> is a useful tool for probing the integrity of the central reading processes. 9 page(s...|$|R

50|$|One final {{thing for}} which Herberstein and his book was noted, though not widely understood, was his {{contribution}} to a <b>spelling</b> confusion which did not emerge {{until the end of}} the 19th century and still causes disagreement: he recorded the <b>spelling</b> of tsar as czar.
