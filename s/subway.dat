5|$|By the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City <b>Subway</b> was at {{an all-time}} low. Ridership had dropped to 1910s levels, and {{graffiti}} and crime were rampant on the subway; in general, the <b>subway</b> was very poorly maintained during that time, and delays and track problems were common. Still, the NYCTA managed to open six new <b>subway</b> stations in the 1980s, make the current fleet of <b>subway</b> cars graffiti-free, as well as order 1,775 new <b>subway</b> cars. By the early 1990s, conditions had improved significantly, although maintenance backlogs accumulated during those 20 years are still being fixed today.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, 1976, an {{arsonist}} lit a {{fire on a}} <b>subway</b> {{train at}} Christie station. The fire destroyed four <b>subway</b> cars and some wall tiles, and resulted in {{a section of the}} <b>subway</b> being closed for a few days. On September 19, 2007, the station modernization program was started. This program would result in making the <b>subway</b> system more accessible, add new bus and streetcar platforms, and improve the connections to regional buses and GO trains.|$|E
5|$|SIR {{operates}} 24/7 with modified R44 New York City <b>Subway</b> cars, and {{is run by}} the New York City Transit Authority, {{an agency}} of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and operator of the New York City <b>Subway.</b> However, there is no direct rail link between the SIR and the <b>subway</b> system proper. SIR riders do get a free transfer to New York City <b>Subway</b> lines, and the line is included on official New York City <b>Subway</b> maps. Commuters who use the railway typically use the Staten Island Ferry to reach Manhattan; the line is accessible from within the Ferry Terminal and most of its trains connect with the ferry.|$|E

In addition Henderson and organizers in Seattle began a global email outreach campaign to invite musicians across the world to join Bach in the <b>Subways</b> Day 2015. On March 21, 2015, Johann Sebastian Bach’s 330th birthday, thousands of musicians in 130 cities in 40 countries participated in the fifth Bach in the <b>Subways</b> Day.|$|R
5|$|Since the 2000s, the New York City <b>Subway</b> has {{undergone}} its biggest expansion program {{since the late}} 1960s, with five stations opened since 2009. There are up to 15 more <b>subway</b> stations definitively planned. Still, the 21st-century expansion plan {{pales in comparison to}} some of the <b>subway</b> system's other previous plans, {{as well as to the}} ambitious expansion of the <b>subway</b> in the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Access {{between the}} {{platforms}} is via a <b>subway</b> with ramps {{at the west}} end of the platforms, although the station is not considered completely accessible as the ramps are steeper than 1 in 12.

The <b>subway</b> is decorated with murals painted by local schoolchildren, reflecting the history and culture of Bristol.|$|E
5|$|By annual ridership, the New York City <b>Subway</b> is {{the busiest}} rapid transit rail system {{in both the}} Western Hemisphere and the Western world, {{as well as the}} seventh busiest rapid transit rail system in the world; only the metro (<b>subway)</b> systems in Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, Guangzhou, and Moscow record higher annual ridership. In 2015, the <b>subway</b> {{delivered}} over 1.76 billion rides, averaging approximately 5.7 million daily rides on weekdays and a combined 5.9 million rides each weekend (3.3 million on Saturdays; 2.7 million on Sundays). Ridership continues to increase, and on September 23, 2014, more than 6.1 million people rode the <b>subway</b> system, establishing the highest single-day ridership since ridership was regularly monitored in 1985.|$|E
5|$|During July 2017, Governor Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio disputed who has {{control of}} the <b>subway</b> system.

However, de Blasio argued that his large $2.5 billion {{contribution}} was enough.|$|E

5|$|Far Rockaway is {{notably the}} oldest station {{currently}} in {{operation in the}} New York City <b>Subway,</b> having originally opened over 145 years ago, on July 29, 1869, as a Long Island Rail Road station. However, Gates Avenue on the BMT Jamaica Line in Brooklyn is the oldest station in the <b>subway</b> system to have been built as a rapid transit station, {{and has been in}} continuous operation for over 130 years. The Far Rockaway station was converted from Long Island Rail Road trackage to <b>subway</b> loading gauge and has only operated for 57 years in this capacity. Therefore, Far Rockaway is actually the fifteenth newest station in the <b>subway</b> system (behind Grand Street; Harlem–148th Street; 57th Street; the three Archer Avenue Line stations; the three IND 63rd Street Line stations; the new South Ferry station; 34th Street–Hudson Yards; and the three Second Avenue <b>Subway</b> stations).|$|E
5|$|Far Rockaway–Mott Avenue is {{the eastern}} {{terminal}} {{station on the}} New York City Subway's IND Rockaway Line.

The original surface station on this site was opened in 1869; the current elevated station began operation as a <b>subway</b> station on January 16, 1958. The station was renovated in 2009–2012 {{at a cost of}} $117 million.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, BOT {{superintendent}} Philip E. Pheifer {{put forth}} a proposal for Second Avenue <b>Subway</b> services, which would branch extensively off to B Division. The <b>subway</b> was originally to be opened by 1951, but by 1945, plans for the Second Avenue <b>Subway</b> were again revised. Another plan was put forth in 1947 by Colonel Sidney H. Bingham, a city planner and former Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) engineer. O'Dwyer and Gross believed that construction of a Second Avenue <b>subway</b> line would be vital to both increasing capacity on existing lines and allowing new branch lines to be built. Bingham's proposal involved more branch lines and track connections than did Phiefer's, and similar to the 1960s and 1990s phased proposals, was {{to be built in}} sections. However, by the next year, New York City was short $145 million that was needed for a $800 million program for rehabilitation and proposed capital improvements. The City petitioned the New York State Legislature to exceed its $655 million debt ceiling so that the city could spend $500 million on <b>subway</b> construction, but this request was denied.|$|E

5|$|In Boston, an {{undercover}} cop {{waits for the}} <b>subway,</b> alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping the fare barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the <b>subway</b> comes to a screeching halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when the train is back up and running, a batch of commuters enter the <b>subway</b> car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, {{after it}} was {{announced}} that Phase 2 might cost $6 billion, transit experts expressed concern that the Second Avenue <b>Subway</b> might be so excessively costly as to preclude construction of Phases 3 and 4, as well as future expansions. One expert stated that the Phase 1 project was the most expensive <b>subway</b> project in the world, and that compared to other <b>subway</b> systems around the world, the cost of building new subways in New York City was much higher. The Second Avenue Subway's per-mile construction cost is higher than that of other projects in similar cities like London's Crossrail and Paris's Grand Paris Express, which themselves are among the most expensive underground-railway projects in the world. MTA officials stated that the Second Avenue <b>Subway</b> cost as much as it did only because of the complex underground infrastructure in Manhattan, as well as the fact that the New York City <b>Subway</b> runs all the time.|$|E
