25|$|Exxon {{recovered}} {{a significant portion}} of clean-up and legal expenses through insurance claims associated with the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. Also, in 1991, Exxon made a quiet, separate financial settlement of damages with a group of seafood producers known as the Seattle Seven for the disaster's effect on the Alaskan seafood industry. The agreement granted $63.75million to the Seattle Seven, but stipulated that the seafood companies would have to repay almost all of any punitive damages awarded in other civil proceedings. The $5billion in punitive damages was awarded later, and the Seattle Seven's share could have been as high as $750million if the damages award had held. Other plaintiffs have objected to this secret arrangement, and when it came to light, Judge Holland ruled that Exxon <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> the jury at the start that an agreement had already been made, so the jury would know exactly how much Exxon would have to pay.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Eddie and Carol talk but he {{defends his}} son {{when she says}} she thinks Michael has a mean streak. He gives Kat some money for Tommy before leaving but does not go far and bonds with Carol's grandson, Liam Butcher (James Forde). Kat finds Eddie and invites him to stay. They visit Michael's boxing club where he tells Michael that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him Tommy is his grandson. Michael, however, gives Eddie money and tells him to take his family far away. Eddie asks {{what it will take}} for him to get over what happened, and later tells Michael's girlfriend Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) that he does not {{remember}} why they fell out. Roxy and Eddie bond and Michael is annoyed. Michael repeatedly tells Eddie to stay away from him, Tommy and Roxy but Kat tells him he can stay {{for as long as he}} wants. Michael tells Roxy that Eddie murdered his mother, Maggie. Eddie confirms this but says he was not there when she died but left Michael with her (he was then 6 years old), knowing he shouldn't. She died of an overdose and Michael blames him. He later helps Carol fix a blocked sink at the café and she invites him for tea after he bonds further with Liam. Liam skips school and Eddie helps him with a hobby. Carol is annoyed that Liam did not go to school but thanks Eddie for spending time with Liam by kissing him. Eddie's son, Tyler (Tony Discipline), arrives in Walford and makes Eddie miss meeting Michael to try to make amends. Michael refuses to accept Eddie's apology.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised {{there was nothing wrong with}} that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.|$|E

2500|$|The first Chinese {{historical}} archive {{also recorded}} that on 4 September 1730 AD (on the lunar calendar), Tian Wenjing, {{governor of the}} Eastern River, fell ill. Emperor Yongzheng sent a royal doctor to visit and provided him with 200g of GuilingJi. In red calligraphy it was written: [...] "Please try your best to recover. You <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> me sooner. Why are you looking all over? Here is your reward.” Imperial records show that Emperor Yongzheng usually rewarded ministers with only 5g of GuilingJi. By rewarding Tian Wenjing with not only 200g, but also the original GuilingJi prescription it showed the emperor highly valued Tian Wenjing.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2015, Abrams ComicArts {{published}} the graphic novel adaptation of Leguizamo's one-man Broadway show, Ghetto Klown. As with the live show, the graphic novel explores the actor/comedian's life and career, beginning with his adolescence in Queens, New York, {{his involvement in}} '80s avant-garde theater, his feature film career, {{and some of the}} colorful characters he encountered throughout his life. Leguizamo describes the work thusly: [...] "Ghetto Klown is the history that I probably never <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> anyone but my therapist, but it's a real lesson that even if you suffer a certain amount (a lot) of self-doubt and anxiety, you can still accomplish great things. It’s a lesson I'm really excited to impart to a whole new audience." [...] The comic [...] is illustrated by Christo Cassano.|$|E

2500|$|This assault forced Dr Hewson into {{a partial}} backdown, agreeing not to levy the GST on food. But this {{concession}} opened Hewson {{to charges of}} weakness and inconsistency, and also complicated the arithmetic of the whole package, since the weakening of the GST reduced the scope for tax cuts, the most attractive element of the package for middle-class voters. The complications of the new package were famously demonstrated in the [...] "birthday cake interview", in which Hewson was unable {{to answer a question}} posed by journalist Mike Willesee about whether or not a birthday cake would cost more or less under a Coalition government. Hewson was instead forced into a series of circumlocutions about whether the cake would be decorated, have ice cream in it and so on, considered by some as {{a turning point in the}} election campaign. In reference to the birthday cake interview in an August 2006 interview, Hewson said: [...] "Well I answered the question honestly. The answer's actually right. That doesn't count...I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him (Mike Willesee) to get stuffed!". According to Channel 9's 20 to 1 episode Unscripted and Unplanned, the Birthday Cake Interview incident was the moment Hewson lost the election with the interview held 10 days before polling day. However, polls right up to election day supported a Coalition victory.|$|E
