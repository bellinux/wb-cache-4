If the premature development of cardiovascular risk factors can be anticipated during childhood, cardiovascular events can be prevented effectively by taking appropriate measures. This study was carried out to assess the role of in utero malnutrition in cardiovascular disease development by comparing cord blood lipid profiles and serum insulin levels between small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) term newborns. Methods: Consecutive full-term infants who were born between June 20 and August 19, 2013, at the Obstetric Unit of a Hospital at Secunderabad, India, were enrolled in this study. Participating newborns were divided into SGA group (n = 51; test group) and AGA group (n = 52; control group) based on their gestational age and body <b>weight.</b> <b>Cord</b> blood lipid profile and insulin levels were compared between these two groups. Results: As compared to the newborns in AGA group, SGA group of newborns had significantly (P< 0. 01) higher levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein. No difference was observed between the groups for high-density lipoprotein and insulin levels. Mild and moderate anaemia was observed among mothers of both groups, while severe anaemia was seen in mothers of SGA group only. Interpretation & conclusions: SGA newborns exhibited elevated lipid profiles as compared to AGA newborns. Hence, SGA newborns should be closely monitored for cardiovascular morbidities during childhood, adolescence and early adult life...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the hypotensive action of the alkaloids of Rauwolfia serpentina (Chopra, 1933) many reports have appeared dealing with the chemistry, pharmacology, and clinical use of these drugs in hypertension. It is still difficult, however, to give a clear idea as to their exact place in therapy. Many workers have reported extremely good results, with a hypotensive response in one-half to three-quarters of the subjects treated (Hughes et al., 1954; Arnold and Bock, 1953; Hensler, 1953; Vakil, 1953; Chakravarty, 1951) while other reports are more disappointing with a satisfactory response in only 33 per cent (Wilkins and Judson, 1953) and 8 per cent of subjects treated (L 6 ffler, 1953). Nor is it clear from the reports what dosage should be employed. While Freis and Ari (1954) recommend a maintenance dose of 02 - 0 O 5 mg. reserpine daily others have found this dose completely ineffective and have employed 4 - 06 - 0 mg. daily of the same substance (Douthwaite, 1954).

The aim {{of this study is to}} measure the levels of PCBs and OH-PCBs in maternal and cord blood samples in a population with background levels of PCBs. We analyzed 51 maternal and corresponding cord blood samples in the northern part of the Netherlands. The PCB concentrations in maternal plasma ranged from 2 to 293 ng/g lipid, and OH-PCB concentrations from nondetectable (ND) to 0. 62 ng/g fresh <b>weight.</b> In <b>cord</b> plasma, PCB concentrations were 1 – 277 ng/g lipid, and OH-PCB concentrations, ND to 0. 47 ng/g fresh <b>weight.</b> The <b>cord</b> versus maternal blood calculated ratio was 1. 28 ± 0. 56 for PCBs and 2. 11 ± 1. 33 for OH-PCBs, expressed per gram of lipid. When expressed per gram fresh weight, the ratios are 0. 32 ± 0. 15 and 0. 53 ± 0. 23 for PCBs and OH-PCBs, respectively. A significant correlation between the respective maternal and cord levels for both PCBs and OH-PCBs was found. Our results indicate that OH-PCBs and PCBs are transferred across the placenta to the fetus in concentrations resulting in levels of approximately 50 and 30 %, respectively, of those in maternal plasma. More research in humans is needed to evaluate potential negative effects of these endocrine disruptors on the fetus. Key words: cord blood, human plasma, hydroxylated PCBs, PCB, placental transfer.

The study included 54 pregnant women at delivery with their corresponding full term newborns. They were chosen {{to be free of}} any medical or obstetric problems that may interfere with intrauterine growth and development. Newborn body weight, length, head circumference, arm circumference, chest circumference and Ponderal Index (PI = weight in grams/length in cm 3) were recorded. Serum albumin, prealbumin, retinol binding protein, transferrin and fibronectin in maternal and cord blood were evaluated using radial immunodiffusion kits. Cases were put into two groups: low birth weight equal to or less than 2. 5 kg (n = 24) and control above 2. 5 kg (n = 30). In low birth weight group, the correlation between maternal weight and neonatal birth-weight, PI and cord fibronectin was significantly positive. It was negative between maternal body weight and neonatal length, head and chest and arm circumferences. Correlation between maternal BMI and neonatal <b>weight,</b> <b>cord</b> blood albumin and fibronectin was significantly positive. It was negative between BMI and neonatal length, PI, head and chest and arm circumferences. In both studied groups, maternal height positively correlated with neonatal weight. While maternal albumin and fibronectin were significantly lower in low birth weight group, prealbumin, retinol binding protein and transferrin were not. Maternal albumin positively correlated with each of the neonatal length, head and chest and arm circumferences in low birth weight group. Maternal fibronectin positively correlated with each of the neonatal length, PI and cord blood fibronectin and negatively correlated with each of the neonatal head and chest and arm circumferences in low birth weight group. In conclusion, mother underweight and low BMI reduce newborn weight. Newborn length and head, chest and arm circumferences are negatively affected with maternal hypoalbuminemia. While low fibronectin reduces newborn body length and PI, low prealbumin, retinol binding protein and transferrin have no influence on fetal growth...|$|R

40|$|Passive {{transfer}} of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) was achieved using the gamma globulin fraction and purified IgG from sera of rats immunized with Electrophus electricus (eel) acetylcholine receptor (AChR). This demonstrates {{the critical role}} of anti-AChR antibodies in impairing neuromuscular transmission in EAMG. Passive {{transfer of}} anti-AChR antibodies from rats with chronic EAMG induced signs of the acute phase of EAMG in normal recipient rats, including invasion of the motor end-plate region by mononuclear inflammatory cells. Clinical, eletrophysiological, histological, and biochemical signs of acute EAMG were observed by 24 h after antibody transfer. Recipient rats developed profound weakness and fatigability, and the posture characteristic of EAMG. <b>Striking</b> <b>weight</b> loss was attributable to dehydration. Recipient rats showed large decreases in amplitude of muscle responses to motor nerve stimulation, and repetitive nerve stimulation induced characteristic decrementing responses. End-plate potentials were not detectable in many muscle fibers, and the amplitudes of miniature end-plate potentials were reduced in the others. Passively transferred EAMG more severely affected the forearm muscles than diaphragm muscles, though neuromuscular transmission was impaired and curare sensitivity was increased in both muscles. Some AChR extracted from the muscles of rats with passively transferred EAMG {{was found to be}} complexed with antibody, and the total yield of AChR per rat was decreased. The quantitative decrease in AChR approximately paralleled in time the course of clinical and electrophysiological signs. The amount of AChR increased to normal levels and beyond at the time neuromuscular transmission was improving. The excess of AChR extractable from muscle as the serum antibody level decreased probably represented extrajunctional receptors formed in response to functional denervation caused by phagocytosis of the postsynaptic membrane by macrophages. The amount of antibody required to passively transfer EAMG was less than required to bind all AChR molecules in a rat's musculature. The effectiveness of samll amounts of antibody was probably amplified by the activation of complement and by the destruction of large areas of postsynaptic membrane by phagocytic cells. A self-sustaining autoimmune response to AChR was not provoked in animals with passively transferred EAMG...|$|R

Air Wakes are huge source of vibrational energy and these vibrations are harnessed using energy regenerative engineering technology. The lifting aircraft produces turbulent air wakes, which <b>strike</b> light <b>weight</b> swinging elliptical dish plates along sides of the runway.
