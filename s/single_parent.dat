After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie {{returned}} in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him.

Although Jolie's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful. Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003).

A comparison is made with a particular group of female <b>single</b> <b>parents</b> living in the Point St. Charles neighborhood of Montreal. A review of the difficulties faced by this group is provided, particularly their housing concerns and the types of housing available to them. A brief historical overview of Point St. Charles is given so that the reader may better understand the group of female <b>single</b> <b>parents</b> surveyed. An analysis of the survey results reveals that although many of the problems and concerns of <b>single</b> <b>parents</b> described in the literature are similar to those identified in the present survey, few generalizations can be made about their housing problems...|$|R
