40|$|Grain {{yield of}} maize {{cultivated}} {{in the years}} 1997 - 2009 in monoculture and with annual tillage simplifications was assessed in energy and economy terms. Effects of no-tillage system and direct sowing (D) with cultivation with autumn deep (A) and shallow (B) ploughing and cultivation with <b>spring</b> pre-sowing <b>ploughing</b> (C) were compared. It was demonstrated that the 13 -year maize grain yield in no-tillage system and direct sowing was lower by 10. 4 % than the yield obtained in conventional tillage system. The depth of autumn ploughing and its replacement with <b>spring</b> pre-sowing <b>ploughing</b> did not significantly affect the level of grain yield. Direct sowing compared to conventional tillage system reduced costs by on average 11. 6 %, and energy inputs only by 0. 9 %. The energy inputs of 100 kg grain production in direct sowing were higher by over 10 % than the inputs of cultivations based on both autumn ploughing, irrespective of its depth, and of pre-sowing <b>ploughing</b> in the <b>spring.</b> The negative effect of direct sowing on grain yield was compensated by lower costs, which caused that the mean cost of 100 kg grain production for 13 years in direct sowing did not significantly differ from the costs of ploughing cultivations. Energy effectiveness of maize grain production in direct sowing was significantly lower than in the examined ploughing tillage cultivations.

40|$|In crop production, {{the right}} {{operations}} {{are not known}} in beforehand. Many different factors are included: weather, soil type and preceding crop are examples of factors that vary. When soil tillage and seeding are carried out {{there are many different}} strategies to choose between. For a farmer {{to be able to handle}} every situation can be expensive, as it would be essential that the farmer have access to many different types of implements. The question to be asked before a operation is if the cost for the operation is leading to a equal amount of income. In a project that was started in the autumn 2003 with draught measurements the aim was to find out draught requirements for the most common types of implements as a function of soil type and working depth. Draught requirements for the different types of implements should then be the basis for calculation of power requirement and fuel consumption in a computer program for guidance of machinery costs. This work aim to complement earlier draught measurements with values from tillage operations carried out in the spring 2004 and to develop a calculation program for machinery costs. The tillage operations that was studied in this work was harrowing, seeding with shoe coulter, seeding with discs and reduced tillage (carrier and disk harrow). Measurements of draught requirement during seedbed preparation and seeding was done after catch crop, autumn mouldboard <b>ploughing,</b> <b>spring</b> mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> and reduced tillage. The tractor used for draught measurements was a Massey Fergusson 6290 (130 hp). The tractor's fuel consumption had been measured and calibrated by measuring the power at the PTO. With a logger that registered fuel consumption the power that the tractor developed during field work could be registered. Draught requirement for harrowing after ploughing was higher than after reduced tillage. Harrowing after <b>spring</b> mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> had the highest draught requirements. The draught requirement was reduced between first and second passage. Draught requirement for the grain drill with discs was highest at direct drilling tillage but there was small difference between the series. Seeding after conventional tillage (2 times harrowing after autumn mouldboard ploughing) was done with both shoe coulter and discs, the grain drill whit discs had a double draught requirement compared with shoe coulter. The calculation program was build up with the aim to be able to calculate the costs for all the machinery operations on a farm and use the results of the draught measurements to calculate fuel consumption. The program can simulate a farm with up to eight tractors and fifteen implements. Through connecting tractors with implements it´s possible to simulate tillage on the field.

The experimental field was situated on a loamy sand soil in Västergötland, in western Sweden. The field was divided into eight separate tile-drained plots, each with an area of 840 m². The amount of drainage water was measured and water samples were collected twice a month. The water samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Soil samples were taken periodically from the 0 - 90 cm soil layer for analysis of mineral nitrogen. Plant material was sampled in late summer, late sutumn and early spring to measure plant growth and nutrient in crops, weeds and plat residues. The crop sequence was: oats (1993 and 1994), spring barley (1995), potatoes (1996), oats (1997) and spring barley (1998). The fertilizer regimes were commercial fertilizer according to normal reccommendations (90 kg N/ha) or half the dose of commercial fertilizer (45 kg N/ha) supplemented with pig slurry (on average, 94 kg tot-N/ha) applied before sowing in spring. Treatments with catch crop were ploughed either in April-May or in early November, whereas other treatments without a catch crop were stubble cultivated in August-September and plouged in November, or only plouged in April-May. The catch crop didn't impact negatively on the yield; instead incorporation if catch crop material seemes {{to increase the amount}} of nitrogen available for the next crop, due to increased nitrogen mineralization. Further, the catch crop reduced nitrogen leaching during the cold seasons to half when the catch crop was left to grow until <b>spring</b> <b>ploughing.</b> In late autumn, the amount of nitrogen in catch crop, including other green vegetation, was 15 - 17 kg N/ha, which were in the same range as the decrease of nitrogen leaching in treatments with <b>spring</b> <b>ploughing</b> and an undersown ryegrass. When tillage was delayed from early autumn to spring (without a catch crop), nitrogen leaching decreased with 25 %, due to lower mineralization during autumn and winter. Ploughing in spring did not result in increased nitrogen delivery from the soil during growing season, compared with tillage in early autumn. When pig slurry was used, nitrogen leaching increased somewhat, compared with treatments with commercial fertilizer nitrogen, due to increased nitrogen mineralization. The amount of plant available soil nitrogen during the growing season was also larger in treatments with pig slurry applications. Balances of nitrogen were positive in all treatments, especially in treatments with catch crop and <b>spring</b> <b>ploughing.</b> By <b>spring</b> <b>ploughing</b> and using a catch crop it seems to be possible to manipulate the mineralization to be lower wintertime and increse during the growing season.

40|$|Nitrogen {{leaching}} following {{cultivation of}} grazed grass-clover on coarse sandy soil Background and objectives When grass-clover is ploughed {{there is a}} high risk of nitrogen leaching. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure the effectiveness of an early catch crop in reducing nitrogen leaching from coarse sandy soil. Barley as a green crop for silage was undersown with Italian ryegrass in spring and harvested at the beginning of early heading, and the Italian ryegrass was subsequently used for roughage production in autumn. Material and methods Experiments were established in spring 2003 on a commercial organic farm with a coarse sandy soil. Two fields with grass-clover were ploughed. One field, a 3 -year-old grass-clover, had formed part of a crop rotation dominated by cereals, and the other, a 5 -year-old grass-clover, was part of a grass-intensive rotation grazed by dairy cows. After ploughing the grass-clover, the following treatments were established in each of the two fields: 1) spring barley, harvested at maturity and subjected to mechanical weed control in autumn (“Mature”) and 2) spring barley harvested early as a green crop for silage with an undersown catch crop of Italian ryegrass (“Green”), which was mowed twice in autumn. The treatments were fertilized with 0, 60 or 120 kg ammonium-N ha- 1 in cattle slurry, injected in the <b>spring</b> following <b>ploughing.</b> The resultant treatments are called: Mature- 0 N, Mature- 60 N, Mature- 120 N, Green- 0 N, Green- 60 N and Green- 120 N.

Results and conclusions Nitrate leaching after Mature- 0 N was 174 and 240 kg N ha- 1 in 3 -year-old and the 5 -year-old grass-clover, respectively, when the soil was kept bare by rotovating twice during autumn. In Mature- 120 N leaching was 302 and 316 kg N ha- 1. In Green- 0 N and Green- 120 N leaching was only 7 - 9 kg N ha- 1.

The basin tillage is being targeted for households with limited or no access to draught animals while ripping is meant for smallholder farmers with some draught animal power. Trials were established at four farms in Gwanda and Insiza in southern Zimbabwe to determine soil water contributions and runoff water losses from plots under four different tillage treatments. The tillage treatments were hand-dug planting basins, ripping, conventional <b>spring</b> and double <b>ploughing</b> using animal-drawn implements. The initial intention was to measure soil water changes and runoff losses from cropped plots under the four {{tillage practices}}. However, due to total crop failure, only soil water and runoff were measured from bare plots between December 2006 and April 2007. Runoff losses were highest under conventional ploughing. Planting basins retained most of the rainwater that fell during each rainfall event. The amount of rainfall received at each farm significantly influenced the volume of runoff water measured. Runoff water volume increased with increase {{in the amount of}} rainfall received at each farm. Soil water content was consistently higher under basin tillage than the other three tillage treatments. Significant differences in soil water content were observed across the farms according to soil types from sand to loamy sand.

40|$|Dryland {{farming in}} the dry semi-humid regions of {{northern}} China is dominated by mono-cropping systems with mainly maize (Zea mays L.) or wheat (Triticum aestivum), constrained by low and variable rainfall, and by improper management practices. Addressing these problems, field studies on tillage and residue management for winter wheat and spring maize were conducted at 4 sites in Linfen, Tunliu and Shouyang (Shanxi province) and Luoyang (Henan province). These studies (a. o.) explored the impacts of different tillage and residue application methods on soil physical conditions, water storage, water use, water use efficiency (WUE) and crop yields of wheat and maize. An analysis {{of the results of}} these studies is presented. Conservation tillage, comprising no-till as well as reduced tillage practices (subsoiling, deep ploughing) showed benefits which were more prominent in combination with residue application. Benefits compared to conventional tillage were found in the form of improved soil physical conditions, such as higher topsoil bulk densities but lower subsoil bulk densities. This resulted in a better water storage during the summer fallow or rainy season in winter wheat fields, and a better water conservation and soil protection in spring maize fields. Compared to conventional methods, reduced tillage gave yields around 13 – 16 % higher in spring maize and round 9 – 37 % higher in winter wheat. Yields under no-till were very close to those from conventional methods. Surface application of crop residue for maize was found to increase the risk for delayed seedling emergence, because of low temperatures, leading to a recommendation for incorporation of residue in combination with reduced tillage. For winter wheat, subsoiling in combination with straw mulching after harvest in summer every other two or three year, and no-till seeding is a promising practice for sandier soils and low rainfall conditions. For heavier clay loam soils, deep ploughing with straw mulching after wheat harvest in summer every other two or three year, and no-till seeding practice is recommended. For <b>spring</b> maize, deep <b>ploughing</b> with straw and fertilizers incorporation after harvest in fall, and no-till seeding practices are recommended.

40|$|During {{a three-year}} period studies of {{nitrogen}} dynamics, the utilization ratio of nitrogen by crops, and the leaching of nitrogen by tile drainage water in sandy soil in south-western Sweden. The field was divided into ten separate tile-drained plots, each with an area of 0. 16 hectare. The amount of drainage water from each plot was measured and water samples were collected twice a month and weekly during flood periods. The water samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus an potassium. The fertilizer regimes were: Unfertilized, commercial fertilizer according to general recommendations (90 - 110 kg/ha), liquid manure (pig slurry) in spring or autumn (90 - 110 tot. N kg/ha) supplemented with commercial fertilizer applied in the spring (45 - 55 N kg/ha) and treatments with double amount of liquid manure applied in spring or autumn also supplemented with commersial fertilizer. all treatments were grown with and without a catch crop exept the treatments with autumn application of mature that are {{required by law to}} be followed by a green cover during the winter. During the first two years, Ialian ryegrass, and in the year perennial ryegrass wass grown as catch crop. The ryegrass was undersown in the main crop. The grop rotation was: Oat (1989), spring wheat (1990) an barley (1991). The treatments with ryegrass were ploughed in the spring whereas the other treatments were ploughed in the autumn after stubble cultivation following harvest. The catch crop reduced the spring leaching substially in the single dose treatments with only commersial fertilizer and in th combined system with both manure and commercial fertilizer. The reduction was as high as 74 and 78 %, respectively, but in the treatment with a double dose of pig slurry the reduction stopped at 50 %. When pig slurry was applied in the autumn, the losses were doubled compared to spring application in spite of the catch crop. The unfertilized treatment (8 years) without a cac crop had 50 % less leaching compared with treatments with springapplied normal doses of fertilizers without a catch crop. The yield in the unfertilized treatment was only 34 % of the yield in the treatment with a normal dose of commercial fertilicer. The treatment with a singel dose of manure and half a dose of commercial fertilizer, bothe appliedin the spring, gave 7 % higher yield but a more lodged stand compared with the treatment with a single dose of commercial fertilize. The last two treatments had the best nitrogen utilization ration (82 % of applied N was taken away by the grain yield). A double dose of manure lowered both the yield and the nitrogen utilization ratio indipendent of time of application. The main reason for this was higher lodging tendency and higher leaching values. The cath crop lowered the yield (7 - 24 %) both in 1989 and 1990 in the treatment with spring-applied fertilizers. Also the fertilizer utilization ration was lower in the catch crop treatments. But in 1991 the diffferences were smaller. The main reason for this seems to be a delivery by mineralization from organic nitrogen from earlier ploughed-in catch crops. Important reasons for the drop in yield in the treatments with a catch crop seem to be competition with the main crop and large deficiency of mineral nitrogen in the early spring compared with treatments without a catch crop. Any net immobilization of nitrogen following the ploughing-in of cath crop could not be verified. At the time of yellow ripeness for the cereals, the intersown ryegrass had taken up 7 - 14 N kg/ha in the standing crop (above ground) {{and in the middle of}} November 11 - 90 N kg/ha, most in treatments were the nitrogen supply was good, such as in treatments with autumn application of manure or in treatments where the frequent use of manure had enlargeed the mineralization capacity of the soil. In the autumn the dry matter content of the catch crop varied between 800 - 2700 kg d. w. per hectare. From last autumn to early spring the N content of ryegrass changed only very little. The catch crops decreased the amount of mineral nitrogen in the soil (0 - 90 cm) from the time of yellow ripeness to late autumn exept in the treatments with autumn-applied manure. In treatments without a catch crop, the nitrogen mineralization capacity of the soil. In late autumn the dry matter content of the ryegrass changed only very little. The catch crops decreased the amounts of mineral nitrogen in the soil 80 - 90 cm) from the time of wellow ripeness to late autumn exept in the treatments with autumn-applied manure. In treatments without a catch crop, the nitrogen mineralization increased in the storage of mineral nitrogen throughout the autumn, leading to a higher leaching during the following winter compared with treatments with a catch crop. In the treatments with a catch crop, the mineral nitrogen storage continued to be fairly small until the time of <b>spring</b> <b>ploughing.</b> During the time from <b>spring</b> <b>ploughing</b> with a catch crop than in corresponding treatments without a catch crop. Yearly application of manure enlarged the delivery of mineral nitrogen from the soil compared with to treatments without manure. The delivery was also lowered in the treatment without any fertilizer application. Calculations show that a frequent manure addition gave an enlarged nitrogen leachong magnitude, as well as increased ammoniavolatilization and denitrification. In the autumn-ploughed treatments without a catch crop, the net mineralization of nitrogen from the time of yellow ripeness to early spring was higher than in the treatments with catch crop and <b>spring</b> <b>ploughing.</b> However, during the growing season, the minratlization was higher in the treatments with a catch crop and <b>spring</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Thus, it seems as if anutumn ploughing stimulates the mineral N-mobilization during winter. In the treatments with a spring ploughed catch crop, the net mineralization during growing season is enlarged. The amounths of nitrogen mineralization also increased during the years, suggesting an additional influence of several years durration given by the ryegrass residues. The combination of a cath crop and <b>spring</b> <b>ploughing</b> therefore seems to both diminish leaching losses though retention of nitrogen in plants and plant residues, and futher offer a possibility to govern nitrogen prosesses in the soil in such a way that nitrogen ta a greater extent will released when it can be utilized by the crop...|$|E
40|$|The {{period after}} {{ploughing}} of grass-clover within a ley-arable rotation is when nitrogen accumulated during ley cropping is {{most vulnerable to}} loss. I investigated how date of ploughing and date of cessation of grazing before ploughing influenced losses of nitrogen as nitrous oxide during establishment of the first cereal crop. Crop nitrogen uptake was also assessed. Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions in the 1 - 2 month period after autumn or <b>spring</b> <b>ploughing</b> or after sowing were typically between 20 and 150 g N ha- 1 day- 1 and increased with temperature and rainfall. Tillage and sowing operations on previously ploughed soil stimulated N 2 O emissions even several months after ploughing. Cumulative N 2 O emissions were highest (~ 8 kg ha- 1 over 17 months) after late cessation of grazing and late ploughing, and lowest (~ 5. 5 kg ha- 1) after early cessation of grazing and early ploughing. The optimum time of ploughing appears to be midwinter when the cold restricts nitrogen mineralisation, but sufficient nitrogen subsequently becomes available for early spring crop growth and satisfactory N offtake. Restricting tillage operations to cool conditions should help to reduce N 2 O emissions. However, the soil should also be dry enough {{to reduce the risk}} of damage to soil structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the time of {{incorporation}} of different green manures and barley residues on the grain yield of spring cereals in two successive seasons was studied in seven field trials. Annual hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), westerwold ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam. var. westerwoldicum) and straw of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were incorporated into the soil by ploughing in early September, late October and the following May, and by reduced tillage in May. Spring barley was established in the following spring, and spring oats (Avena sativa L.) one year later. In general the grain yield of spring barley after legumes was similar to that after barley, {{in spite of the fact}} that N fertilization was reduced by 40 kg ha- 1. The two autumn ploughing treatments resulted in a good yield of spring barley more reliably than did the spring incorporations. Because delayed autumn ploughing did not decrease the grain yield, a delaying procedure can be recommended for its potential of decreasing nitrogen leaching. <b>Spring</b> <b>ploughing</b> could be used on all but clay soils. Incorporating ryegrass or red clover in spring by using reduced tillage often decreased the grain yield of barley. Timing of incorporation did not have a consistent effect on the grain yield of oats in the third experimental year. ...|$|E
40|$|Crop {{residues}} {{and plant}} cover represent {{a pool of}} organic matter {{that can be used}} either to restore organic matter in soils, and therefore maintain soil fertility, or that can be valorized outside of the field (e. g. energy production). However, it is crucial that the exportation of residues is not done {{to the detriment of the}} system sustainability. Three long term experiments have been settled in the loamy region in Belgium. All of them are designed to study the effect of residues management by several tillage systems (conventional plowing versus reduced tillage) on the whole soil-water-plant system. SOLRESIDUS is a field experiment where we study the impact of crop residue management while in SOLCOUVERT and SOLCOUVERT-BIS, we study the impact of cover crop management. SOLRESIDUS was started in 2008. In this field, four contrasted crop residues managements are tested in order to contrast as much as possible the responses from the soil-water plant system. Two practices characterize the four modalities: soil tillage (ploughing at 25 cm depth or reduce tillage at 10 cm max) and residue management (exportation or restitution). SOLCOUVERT and SOLCOUVERT-BIS were started in 2012 and 2013 respectively. In those fields cover crop management is also diverse: destruction of the cover crop by winter ploughing, <b>spring</b> <b>ploughing,</b> strip tillage (with a chemical destruction if needed) or shallow tillage (with a decompaction before cover crop sowing). Although although the overall project aims at studying the impact of management on the whole soil-water-plant system, here we will only present the results concerning crop production (sugar beet) in SOLCOUVERT experiments. The presented data will include germination rate, crop development (biomass quantification and BBCH stages) weeds population, disease occurrence, pest occurrences, nitrogen uptake by plants, quality and quantity of harvested products. ...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{farming is}} {{considered}} an effective mean of reducing nitrogen losses compared with more intensive conventional farming systems. However, under certain conditions organic farming may also be susceptible to high nitrogen (N) losses. This is especially the case for organic dairy farms on sandy soils that use grazed grass-clover in rotation with cereals, which may lead to high rates of nitrate leaching. A study was conducted on two commercial organic farms on sand and loamy sand soils. On each farm a three year old grass-clover field was selected. Half of the field was ploughed {{the first year and}} the other half was ploughed the next year. Spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was sown after the <b>spring</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Measurements showed a low N leaching during the pasture period (9 - 64 kg N ha- 1) but a high leaching the first (63 - 216 kg N ha- 1) and second (61 - 235 kg N ha- 1) year after ploughing. In addition, a high residual N effect of the pasture was observed on the barley yields in both years. There was thus a low response to manure application on the sandy soil both during the first and second year after ploughing. To study the underlying processes affecting the residual effects of the pasture and the N leaching, the dynamic whole farm model FASSET was used to simulate all the treatments on both farms. The simulations agreed with the observed barley yields. However, for the sandy soil the simulation of nitrate leaching and mineral nitrogen in the soil deviated from the measurements. Three scenarios with changes in model parameters were constructed to investigate this discrepancy. These scenarios suggested that the organic matter turnover model should include a pool with a half-life of about 2 - 3 years. There may also be a need to include effects of soil disturbance (tillage) on soil organic matter turnover. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Legume-based {{catch crops}} (LBCCs) may {{act as an}} {{important}} source of nitrogen (N) in organic crop rotations because of biological N fixation. However, the potential risk of high nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions needs {{to be taken into account}} when including LBCCs in crop rotations. Here, we report the results from a one-year field experiment, which investigated N availability and N 2 O emissions as affected by three LBCCs, i. e., red clover (CL), red clover–ryegrass mixture (GC) and winter vetch (WV), two non-LBCCs, i. e., perennial ryegrass (GR) and fodder radish (FR), and a control (CO) without catch crops. The effect of two catch crop management strategies was also tested: autumn harvest of the catch crop versus incorporation of whole-crop residues by <b>spring</b> <b>ploughing.</b> LBCCs accumulated 59 – 67 kg N ha− 1 in their tops, significantly more than those of the non-LBCC, 32 – 40 kg N ha− 1. Macro-roots accounted for > 33 % of total N in the catch crops. In accordance with this, LBCCs enhanced the performance of the succeeding unfertilised spring barley, thus obtaining a grain yield of 3. 3 – 4. 5 Mg ha− 1 compared to 2. 6 – 3. 3 Mg ha− 1 grain yield from non-LBCC and the fallow control treatments. Autumn harvest of catch crops, especially LBCCs, tended to reduce crop yield. The annual N 2 O emissions were comparable across treatments except for fodder radish, which had the highest N 2 O emission, and also the highest average yield-scaled N 2 O emission, at 499 g N 2 O-N Mg− 1 grain. Although the sampling strategy employed in this study introduces uncertainty about the spatial and temporal variability, differences in seasonal emission patterns among catch crops were captured and harvest of catch crops in late autumn induced significantly higher emissions during winter, but lower emissions after residue incorporation in spring. In comparison with non-LBCC, LBCCs have the potential to partly replace the effect of manure application in organic cropping systems with greater crop production and less environmental footprint with respect to N 2 O emissions. However, harvest of the catch crops may reduce crop yield unless the harvested N is recycled as fertiliser to the crops in the rotation...|$|E
