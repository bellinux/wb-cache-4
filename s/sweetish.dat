25|$|Prosopis cineraria is much valued as a fodder tree. The {{trees are}} heavily lopped {{particularly}} during winter months when no {{other green fodder}} {{is available in the}} dry tracts. There is a popular saying that death will not visit a man, even at the time of a famine, if he has a Prosopis cineraria, a goat and a camel, since the three together are some what said to sustain a man even under the most trying condition. The forage yield per tree varies a great deal. On an average, the yield of green forage from a full grown tree is expected to be about 60kg with complete lopping having only the central leading shoot, 30kg when the lower two third crown is lopped and 20kg when the lower one third crown is lopped. The leaves are of high nutritive value. Feeding of the leaves during winter when no other green fodder is generally available in rain-fed areas is thus profitable. The pods have a <b>sweetish</b> pulp and are also used as fodder for livestock.|$|E
500|$|The cap is fan-shaped to semicircular and convex, {{reaching}} {{a diameter of}} [...] It lacks a stalk, and is instead attached broadly to the substrate. The fruit bodies are initially soft and spongy, but become hard and brittle once they have lost their moisture. The cap surface is covered with matted hairs, has shallow concentric furrows, and a dull brownish-orange color. The flesh is up to [...] thick at the thickest part, and is a pale cinnamon color. The pore surface is yellowish to brownish, and the pores are angular, numbering about 2–4 per millimeter. In young fruit bodies, the pore surface bruises reddish brown. The mushroom's odor and taste ranges from <b>sweetish</b> to indistinct.|$|E
500|$|The fungus is {{classified}} in the stirps (species thought to be descendants of a common ancestor) Diabolum of the genus Hydnellum, a grouping of similar species with the following shared characteristics: flesh that is marked with concentric lines that form alternating pale and darker zones (...) an extremely peppery taste; a <b>sweetish</b> odor; spores that are , and not amyloid (that is, not absorbing iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), acyanophilous (not staining with the reagent Cotton Blue), and covered with tubercules; the presence of clamp connections in the hyphae. Molecular analysis based on the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer DNA of several Hydnellum species placed H.peckii as most closely related to H.ferrugineum and H.spongiosipes.|$|E
500|$|Hydnellum diabolus (the species epithet {{is given}} the neuter diabolum in some publications) has a very similar appearance, {{so much so that}} some {{consider}} it and H.peckii to be synonymous; H.diabolus is said to have a <b>sweetish</b> pungent odor that is lacking in H.peckii. The differences between the two species are amplified in mature specimens: H.diabolus has an irregularly thickened stem, while the stem of H.peckii is thickened by a [...] "definite spongy layer". Additionally, old specimens of H.peckii have a smooth cap, while H.diabolus is tomentose. The related species H.pineticola also exudes pink droplets of liquid when young and moist. Commonly found growing under conifers in northeastern North America, H.pineticola tastes [...] "unpleasant", but not acrid. Fruit bodies tend to grow singly, rather than in fused clusters, and, unlike H.peckii, they do not have bulbous stems.|$|E
2500|$|Alums {{are useful}} {{for a range of}} {{industrial}} processes. They are soluble in water, have a [...] <b>sweetish</b> taste, react acid to litmus, and crystallize in regular octahedra. In alums each metal ion is surrounded by six water molecules. When heated, they liquefy, and if the heating is continued, the water of crystallization is driven off, the salt froths and swells, and at last an amorphous powder remains. They are astringent and acidic.|$|E
2500|$|The wild form of celery {{is known}} as [...] "smallage". It has a furrowed stalk with {{wedge-shaped}} leaves, the whole plant having a coarse, earthy taste, and a distinctive smell. The stalks are not usually eaten (except in soups or stews in French cuisine), but the leaves {{may be used in}} salads, and its seeds are those sold as a spice. With cultivation and blanching, the stalks lose their acidic qualities and assume the mild, <b>sweetish,</b> aromatic taste particular to celery as a salad plant.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a general}} rule, most Australian and South African wines are labeled Shiraz, and most European wines (from such regions where varietal {{labeling}} is practiced) are labeled Syrah. In other countries, practices vary and winemakers (or wine marketers) sometimes choose either Syrah or Shiraz to signify a stylistic {{difference in the}} wine they have made. [...] "Syrah"-labelled wines are sometimes thought to be more similar to classic Northern Rhône reds; presumably more elegant, tannic, smoke-flavoured and restrained {{with respect to their}} fruit component. [...] "Shiraz"-labelled wines, on the other hand, would then be more similar to archetypical Australian or other New World examples; presumably made from riper berries, more fruit-driven, higher in alcohol, less obviously tannic, peppery rather than smokey, usually more easily [...] approached when young, and possibly slightly <b>sweetish</b> in impression. It must however be realized that this rule of thumb is unevenly applied.|$|E
2500|$|This {{plant has}} oval entire leaves, and {{unisexual}} flowers on short stalks. In the male flowers, which are numerous, the stamens are sixteen {{in number and}} arranged in pairs; the female flowers are solitary, with traces of stamens, and a smooth ovary with one ovule {{in each of the}} eight cells—the ovary is surmounted by four styles, which are hairy at the base. The fruit-stalk is very short, bearing a subglobose fruit an inch in diameter or a bit larger, of an orange-yellow color, ranging to bluish, and with a <b>sweetish</b> astringent pulp. [...] It is surrounded at the base by the persistent calyx-lobes, which increase in size as the fruit ripens. [...] The astringency renders the fruit somewhat unpalatable, but after it has been subjected to the action of frost, or has become partially rotted or [...] "bletted" [...] like a medlar, its flavor is improved.|$|E
2500|$|The alumen of {{the ancients}} then, {{was not always}} {{the same as the}} alum of the moderns. They knew how to produce alum from alunite, as this process is archaeologically attested on the island Lesbos. This site was {{abandoned}} in the 7th century but dates back at least to the 2nd century CE. Native alumen from Melos {{appears to have been a}} mixture mainly of alunogen (...) with alum and other minor sulfates. The western desert of Egypt was a major source of alum substitutes in antiquity. These evaporites were mainly , , , [...] and [...] Contamination with iron sulfate was greatly disliked as this darkened and dulled dye colours. They were acquainted with a variety of substances of varying degrees of purity by the names of misy, sory, and chalcanthum. As alum and green vitriol were applied to a variety of substances in common, and as both are distinguished by a <b>sweetish</b> and astringent taste, writers, even after the discovery of alum, do not seem to have discriminated the two salts accurately from each other. In the writings of the alchemists we find the words misy, sory, chalcanthum applied to alum as well as to iron sulfate; and the name atramentum sutorium, which one might expect to belong exclusively to green vitriol, applied indifferently to both. Various minerals are employed in the manufacture of alum, the most important being alunite, alum schist, bauxite and cryolite.|$|E

6000|$|... [9] The Darnel or pod has a <b>sweetish</b> taste, {{not unlike}} that of a {{withered}} pea; pounded and mixed with milk or ghee, it is relished by the Bedouins when vegetable food is scarce.|$|E
60|$|A faint tremor {{passed through}} her, but {{she led the}} way, and seated herself where she could see Betty and the baby. Rosek stood looking down at her; his stillness, the <b>sweetish</b> gravity of his well-cut lips, his spotless dandyism stirred in Gyp a kind of unwilling admiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd almost {{rather it}} had been--the other." [...] Rosek's pale, suave face, {{with the eyes}} behind which there were such hidden things, and the lips <b>sweetish</b> and {{restrained}} and sensual--he would never forgive! But Winton only smiled again, patting her arm. He was pleased with an encounter which had relieved his feelings.|$|E
60|$|His lean {{face was}} {{streaming}} with perspiration, {{and when he}} took off his overcoat there rose the <b>sweetish</b> sourish scent of a hot goatskin waistcoat. It reached below his waist, and would have kept cold out from a man standing in a blizzard, and he had been carrying a baby, a rifle, a bundle, a basket, and running, on a warmish day.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the silence}} was only broken by the {{cheeping}} of sparrows outside the round window, {{and the sound of}} the horse, Hal, munching the last morsel of his carrot. Harbinger was aware in his every nerve of the <b>sweetish,</b> slightly acrid, husky odour of the loosebox, mingling with the scent of Barbara's hair and clothes. And rather miserably, he said for the third time: ...|$|E
60|$|I believe that; {{he will be}} hard to kill. The {{vision of}} him comes up, with his perfect balance, defiant eyes, and <b>sweetish</b> smile; the way the hair of his beard crisped a little, and got blacker on the cheeks; the sort of desperate feeling he gave, that one would never get the better of him, that he would never get the better of himself.|$|E
6000|$|When {{one of the}} Minimuls {{that stood}} basting the spit saw that Nod was awake he summoned others who were {{standing}} near, and many stooped softly over, staring at him, and whispering together. Nod put his finger to his tongue, and said, [...] "Walla!" [...] One of them instantly shuffled away and brought him a little gourd of a <b>sweetish</b> juice like Keeri, which greatly refreshed him.|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} gourd of soup between his knees. It tasted strong of fish, and was green with a satiny river-weed; {{but it was}} hot and <b>sweetish,</b> and he supped it up greedily. And just as he was tilting the bowl for the last mouthful he looked up and saw Thumb's round, {{astonished}} face staring in at the little dark window. He put down his gourd and burst out laughing.|$|E
60|$|Captain Graffenreid lay {{alongside}} the dead man, from beneath whose breast flowed a little rill of blood. It had a faint, <b>sweetish</b> odor that sickened him. The face was crushed {{into the earth}} and flattened. It looked yellow already, and was repulsive. Nothing suggested the glory of a soldier's death nor mitigated the loathsomeness of the incident. He could not turn his back upon the body without facing away from his company.|$|E
60|$|The purblind little {{creature}} shrieked. The traveller {{took the}} sound for affirmation, and passed on. He {{came to a}} third little creature who, under a tall tree, was singing very loudly indeed, while all around was a great silence, broken only by sounds like the snuffling of small noses. The creature stopped singing as the traveller came up, and at once a storm of huge nuts came down; the traveller found them <b>sweetish</b> and very oily.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's a good suggestion, Harrison. What {{a curious}} smell {{there is in}} the air! Do you notice a sort of low, <b>sweetish,</b> spirity kind of scent? Well, perhaps it's my imagination. I dare say that my nerves are a bit strung up these days. But that is a capital idea of yours about having some work to do. I should like to work madly for those hours. Have {{everything}} up out of the back garden and plant it all again in the front.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [p.67] {{snapping}} {{his pistol}} at a Persian pilgrim’s head, he came forth triumphant with two skins of <b>sweetish</b> water, {{for which we}} paid ten piastres. He was in his glory. There were many Meccans in the Caravan, among them his elder brother and several friends: the Sharif Zayd had sent, he said, to ask why he did not travel with his compatriots. That evening he drank so copiously of clarified butter, and ate dates mashed with flour and other abominations to such an extent, that at night he prepared {{to give up the}} ghost.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Sir, {{right there}} {{it struck me}} at the pit of my stomach--sort of sickish, <b>sweetish</b> feeling--that my {{position}} needed regularising pretty bad. I {{ought to have been}} a naturalised burgher of a year's standing; but Ohio's my State, and I wouldn't have gone back on her for a desertful of Dutchmen. That and my enthoosiasm as an inventor had led me to the existing crisis; but I couldn't expect this Captain Mankeltow to regard the proposition that way. There I sat, the rankest breed of unreconstructed American citizen, caught red-handed squirting hell at the British Army for months on end. I tell you, Sir, I wished I was in Cincinnatah that summer evening. I'd have compromised on Brooklyn.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat with}} Gerald {{drinking}} some <b>sweetish</b> liqueur, and staring with black, sullen {{looks at the}} various groups {{of people at the}} tables. She would greet nobody, but young men nodded to her frequently, with a kind of sneering familiarity. She cut them all. And it gave her pleasure to sit there, cheeks flushed, eyes black and sullen, seeing them all objectively, as put away from her, like creatures in some menagerie of apish degraded souls. God, what a foul crew they were! Her blood beat black and thick in her veins with rage and loathing. Yet she must sit and watch, watch. One or two people came to speak to her. From every side of the Cafe, eyes turned half furtively, half jeeringly at her, men looking over their shoulders, women under their hats.|$|E
60|$|Johnson {{sat up in}} {{his chair}} now, {{listening}} keenly, for he knew that a crisis must be at hand. He heard the two doctors moving about, {{and was able to}} distinguish the step of Pritchard, which had a drag in it, from the clean, crisp sound of the other's footfall. There was silence {{for a few minutes and}} then a curious drunken, mumbling sing-song voice came quavering up, very unlike anything which he had heard hitherto. At the same time a <b>sweetish,</b> insidious scent, imperceptible perhaps to any nerves less strained than his, crept down the stairs and penetrated into the room. The voice dwindled into a mere drone and finally sank away into silence, and Johnson gave a long sigh of relief for he knew that the drug had done its work and that, come what might, there should be no more pain for the sufferer.|$|E
6000|$|We are prepared, not {{perhaps to}} prove, but to maintain, that civilization would be {{materially}} aided and abetted by {{the offer of}} a liberal reward for the scalps of Young Persons with the ears attached. Your regular Young Person is a living nuisance, whose every act is a provocation to exterminate her. We say [...] "her," [...] not because, physically considered, the Y. P. is necesarily of the she sex; more commonly is it an irreclaimable male; but morally and intellectually it is an unmixed female. Her virtues are merely milk-and-morality-her intelligence is pure spiritual whey. Her conversation (to which not even her own virtues and intelligence are in any way related) is three parts rain-water that has stood too long and one part cider that has not stood long enough-a sickening, <b>sweetish</b> compound, one dose of which induces in the mental stomach a colicky qualm, followed, if no correctives be taken, by violent retching, coma, and death.|$|E
6000|$|Rosek began playing, {{his eyes}} fixed on the girl, and his mouth {{loosened}} from compression in a <b>sweetish</b> smile. Miss Daphne Wing was standing with her finger-tips joined at her breast--a perfect statue of ebony and palest wax. Suddenly she flung away the black kimono. A thrill swept Gyp from head to foot. She COULD dance--that common little girl! Every movement of her round, sinuous body, of her bare limbs, had the ecstasy of natural genius, controlled by the quivering balance of a really fine training. [...] "A dove flying!" [...] So she was. Her face had lost its vacancy, or rather its vacancy had become divine, having that look--not lost but gone before--which dance demands. Yes, she was a gem, even if she had a common soul. Tears came up in Gyp's eyes. It was so lovely--like a dove, when it flings itself up in the wind, breasting on up, up--wings bent back, poised. Abandonment, freedom--chastened, shaped, controlled! ...|$|E
6000|$|About the {{beginning}} of May, and just before the final exodus of Hill-goers, when the weather was very hot and there were not more than twenty people in the Station, Saumarez gave a moonlight riding-picnic at an old tomb, six miles away, near {{the bed of the}} river. It was a [...] "Noah's Ark" [...] picnic; and there was to be the usual arrangement of quarter-mile intervals between each couple, on account of the dust. Six couples came altogether, including chaperons. Moonlight picnics are useful just {{at the very end of}} the season, before all the girls go away to the Hills.

60|$|The path dropped {{downhill}} for a time, {{crossed a}} ravine, ascended. He passed a great leafless tree on {{which there were}} white flowers. On the ground also, in the darkness under the tree, there were these flowers; they were dropping noiselessly, and since they were visible in the shadows, {{it seemed to him}} that they must be phosphorescent. And they emitted a <b>sweetish</b> scent that lay heavily athwart the path. Presently he passed another such tree. Then he became aware of a tumult ahead of him, a smashing of leaves, a snorting and slobbering, grunting and sucking, a whole series of bestial sounds. He halted for a little while, and then drew nearer, picking his steps to avoid too great a noise. Here were more of those white-blossomed trees, and beneath, in the darkness, something very black and big was going to and fro, eating greedily. Then he found that there were two and then more of these black things, three or four of them.|$|E

60|$|Very {{late that}} same night, Summerhay {{came out of}} the little Chelsea house, which he inhabited, and walked toward the river. In certain moods men turn insensibly toward any space where nature rules a little--downs, woods, waters--where the sky is free to the eye and one feels the broad comradeship of {{primitive}} forces. A man is alone when he loves, alone when he dies; nobody cares for one so absorbed, and he cares for nobody, no--not he! Summerhay stood by the river-wall {{and looked up at the}} stars through the plane-tree branches. Every now and then he drew a long breath of the warm, unstirring air, and smiled, without knowing that he smiled. And he thought of little, of nothing; but a <b>sweetish</b> sensation beset his heart, a kind of quivering lightness his limbs. He sat down on a bench and shut his eyes. He saw a face--only a face. The lights went out one by one in the houses opposite; no cabs passed now, and scarce a passenger was afoot, but Summerhay sat like a man in a trance, the smile coming and going on his lips; and behind him the air that ever stirs above the river faintly moved with the tide flowing up.|$|E
60|$|No {{doubt there}} are {{persons who are}} fond of canned milk; but, for my part, I loathe it. The effect of the <b>sweetish</b> glue upon my inner man is {{singularly}} nauseating. I have even been driven to drink my matutinal coffee in all its after-dinner strength rather than adulterate it with the mixture. You have, it is true, the choice of using the stuff as a dubious paste, or of mixing it with water into a non-committal wash; and, whichever plan you adopt, {{you wish you had}} adopted the other. Why it need be so unpalatably cloying is not clear to my mind. They tell me the sugar is needed to preserve the milk. I never could make out that it preserved anything but the sugar. Simply to see the stuff ooze out of the hole in the can is deterrent. It is enough to make one think seriously at times of adding a good milch cow to his already ample trip encumberment, at the certain cost of delaying the march, and the not improbable chance of being taken for an escaped lunatic. Indeed, to the Japanese mind, to be seen solemnly preceding a caravan of cattle for purposes of diet would certainly suggest insanity. For cows in Japan are never milked. Dairy products, consequently, are not to be had on the road, and the man who fancies milk, butter, or cheese must take them with him.|$|E
