To protect and increase <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services, the driving factors underlying changes in <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> service values must be determined to properly implement forest resource management planning. This study examines the driving {{factors that affect}} changes in <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> service values by focusing on regional forest characteristics using a dataset of 47 prefectures in Japan for 2000, 2007, and 2012. We applied two approaches: a contingent valuation method for estimating the <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> service value per area and a decomposition analysis for identifying the main driving factors {{of changes in the}} value of <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services. The results indicate that the value of <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services has increased due to the expansion of forest area from 2000 to 2007. However, factors related to <b>forest</b> management and <b>ecosystem</b> service value per area have contributed to a decrease in the value of ecosystem services from 2000 to 2007 and from 2007 to 2012, respectively...|$|R

It is also of the most primitive vegetation type that came into being through the natural succession of soil and vegetation following volcanic eruption. The <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> has great importance for maintaining the structures and functions of the watershed ecosystems of the Songhua River, the Yalu River and the Tumen River. We combined physical assessment method (PAM) with the value assessment method (VAM) to evaluate the <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services of the northern slope of the Changbai Mountain, including eco-tourism, forest by-products, timber, soil and water conservation, air purification, and the recycling of nutritive elements. We also assessed the integrated <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> service and analyzed its dynamics. The service value provided by the Changbai Mountain <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> amounts up to RMB 3. 38 X 10 (12) yuan, of which, water conservation is 66 %, water conservation and air purification together make up 80 %, while the timber value is only 7 %.

40|$|Agent-based dynamic {{modelling}} of <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> at the Warra LTER Site A spatially explicit, dynamic {{simulation model}} of <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> at the Warra LTER Site was prepared. The {{advantage of this}} form of modelling is {{that one can not}} only explore the dynamic interactions of the sub-components of the ecosystem but also experiment with different disturbance regimes and management options.

Prior to the addition of the (15) N tracers, the natural (15) N abundance ranging from - 3. 4 ‰ to + 10. 9 ‰ in the forest under heavy N deposition at Dinghushan (DHS), and from - 3. 92 ‰ to + 7. 25 ‰ in the forest under light N deposition at Daxinganling (DXAL). Four months after the tracer application, the total (15) N recovery from the major ecosystem compartments ranged from 55. 3 % to 90. 5 %. The total (15) N recoveries were similar under the ((15) NH 4) 2 SO 4 tracer treatment in both two <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> whereas the total (15) N recovery was significantly lower in the subtropical <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> at DHS than in the boreal <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> at DXAL under the K(15) NO 3 tracer treatment. The (15) N assimilated into the tree biomass represented only 8. 8 % to 33. 7 % of the (15) N added to the <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> In both of the tracer application treatments, more (15) N was recovered from the tree biomass in the subtropical <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> at DHS than the boreal <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> at DXAL.
