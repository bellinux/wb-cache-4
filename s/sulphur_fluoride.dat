50|$|The {{insurgency}} in Balochistan is a guerrilla war waged by Baloch nationalists against {{the governments of}} Pakistan and Iran in the Balochistan region, which covers Balochistan Province in southwestern Pakistan, Sistan and Baluchestan Province in southeastern Iran, and the Balochistan region of southern Afghanistan. Rich in natural resources like natural gas, oil, coal, copper, <b>sulphur,</b> <b>fluoride</b> and gold, this is the least developed province in Pakistan. Armed groups demand greater control of the province's natural resources and political autonomy. Baloch separatists have attacked civilians from other ethnicities in the province. In the 2010s, attacks against the Shia community by sectarian groups — though not always {{directly related to the}} political struggle—have risen, contributing to tensions in Balochistan.|$|E

40|$|Effects of <b>sulphur,</b> <b>fluoride</b> {{and heavy}} metal {{pollution}} on the chlorophyll fluorescence of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needles Abstract: The photochemical activity of photosystem II (PSII) {{was measured by}} chlorophyll a fluorescence intensity of Scots pine needles, from trees growing in various forest experimental areas exposed to air and soil pollution. Fluorescence techniques {{was used as a}} no-invasive method of detection injuries of the photosynthetic apparatus. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters such as PSII photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), chlorophyll fluorescence decrease ratio (Rfd) and size of the acceptor pools available to PSII (Sm) in-dicated seasonal changes in the activity of the photosynthetic apparatus of pine needles. Significant differ-ences in the variable fluorescence parameter rations Fv/Fm and Rfd between the studied sites were found in middle-winter dormancy period in January and also in samples collected in August. Winter inactivation of photosynthesis results in a reduction of the photochemical efficiency Fv/Fm and Rfd. Presented results dem-onstrate that the effect of industrial pollution on Scots pine needles is detectable by of measurements of fluo-rescence parameters. They showed that Scots pine trees indicated physiological adaptation to environmental pollution and this can be monitored by the fluorescence signals earlier than by other methods. Additional key words: chlorophyll a fluorescence, pollution, Scots pine, seasonal changes, stress adaptation Abbreviations: Fo = initial fluorescence (all reaction centers of PSII are open; Fm = maximum fluorescence (all reaction centers of PSII are closed); Sm = size of the acceptor pools available to PS II; Fv = variable fluores-cence (i. e.

40|$|This {{work has}} shown that {{nitrogen}} dioxide will selectively remove uranium hexafluoride from a mixture containing the hexafluorides of uranium, molybdenum and tungsten via the formation of nitrylium hexafluorouranate(V). The production of lower uranium <b>fluorides</b> and elemental <b>sulphur</b> or <b>sulphur</b> <b>fluorides</b> {{from many of the}} attempted preparations of uranium(VI) thiofluorides was predicted from a thermodynamic study of the stabilities of MC 1 nF 6 -n (M = U, Mo, W; n = 1 - 5), MOnF 6 - 2 n' MSnF 6 - 2 n (M = U, Mo, W; n = 1 or 2) with respect to decomposition and disproportionation. Sorption of the liquid hexafluorides on various potential sorbents was investigated. Encouraging results were obtained for cryolite. Salts such as ARuF 6 (A = K, Rb, NH 4) were synthesised by direct interactions between AF and RuF 5 in AHF. These reactions were found to require the presence of a polar solvent. It was found that ruthenium pentafluoride in liquid uranium hexafluoride could be removed by the Introduction of trace quantities of water...|$|R

Experiments were conducted in the Marston Valley. Bedfordshire, where <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and <b>fluoride</b> are the major pollutants. The charcoal filtered chambers enabled pollutant concentrations to be reduced by 60 - 70 %. Cleaning the air increased straw and grain yields. The filtration was non-selective and did not identify the injurious agent. The chambers were found to accelerate the crop's development by 7 - 8 days and reduce yield by suppressing tillering...|$|R
40|$|Two {{series of}} field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to test the effects of aerial pollutants, <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and <b>fluoride,</b> on the growth and yield of cereals, {{where there is no}} visible damage to the plant. The first series, involving barley grown in filtered plastic-covered hooped channels, proved unsatisfactory. The growing conditions of temperature, humidity and light intensity differed from those outside. Modifications were made and an open-topped chamber was introduced. Comparisons were made between plants grown in filtered and unfiltered closed-top and open-top chambers and outside. The fluoride content of the leaves was greatest in the open-top chamber without filtration and least in the closed-top chamber with filtration. Sulphur content was highest in the plants grown outside and lowest in the open-top chamber with filtration. Plant growth and grain yields were higher in the filtered chambers. This strongly suggests a significant loss of yield due to a pollutant level which was earlier considered acceptable...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{design a}} job-exposure matrix for {{epidemiological}} studies {{of men who}} had worked in a Norwegian aluminium smelter between 1922 and 1975. METHODS [...] Jobs held by cohort members were identified from personnel records. Tasks and their locations were determined for all jobs, and information was gathered about changes in exposure conditions over time. The jobs were combined into categories thought to have experienced similar exposure conditions, and time weighted average exposures were estimated on a relative scale. The results were reviewed {{by a panel of}} former smelter employees and an experienced industrial hygienist. RESULTS [...] 96 different jobs could be identified from the cohort members' work histories. These were grouped into 18 categories, and relative exposure intensities were estimated for 31 different combinations of category and period. The most prevalent exposure in the cohort was pot emissions (<b>fluorides,</b> <b>sulphur</b> dioxide, and carbon monoxide; 74 % ever exposed), followed by magnetic fields and heat stress (65 - 68 %), asbestos (40 %), and coal tar pitch volatiles (33 %). CONCLUSIONS [...] Although the use of this job-exposure matrix in the subsequent epidemiological studies may result in some misclassification of exposure, this is unlikely to seriously attenuate true risks in a stratified analysis based on cumulative exposure...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{capillary}} blood eosinophils and {{the prevalence of}} bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) were compared between schoolchildren living in a polluted area (Ardal) and unpolluted area (Laerdal). In Ardal there is an aluminium smelter emitting <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and <b>fluoride</b> to the environment. Daily measurements of these pollutants in ambient air were available. The mean number of eosinophils in Ardal was 220 x 10 (6) /l compared with 106 x 10 (6) /l in Laerdal. The prevalence of BHR was 15. 9 % in Ardal and 11. 8 % in Laerdal. The odds ratio of having BHR in relation to these pollutants during the last 24 hours were: 1. 12 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 01 to 1. 24) by increasing sulphur dioxide with 10 micrograms/m 3, and 1. 31 (95 % CI 1. 07 to 1. 60) when fluoride exposure increased with 1 micrograms/m 3. Similarly, these exposures were associated with a decrease in eosinophils of - 21 x 10 (6) /l (95 % CI - 36 to - 6) and - 52 x 10 (6) /l (95 % CI - 98 to - 8), respectively, in atopics. It is hypothesised that recent exposure to irritants induces changes in the airways leading to BHR in addition to recruitment of eosinophils to the airways in atopic subjects...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{associations between}} exposure to pot emissions (<b>fluorides,</b> <b>sulphur</b> dioxide) and mortality from chronic obstructive lung disease, {{coal tar pitch}} volatiles and mortality from diseases related to atherosclerosis, and carbon monoxide and mortality from ischaemic heart disease. METHODS [...] Mortality between 1962 to 1991 was investigated in a cohort of 1085 men hired by a Norwegian aluminium smelter between 1922 and 1975. Associations between cumulative exposure and mortality were investigated through SMR analysis based on national mortality rates; temporal relations were explored by considering exposures only within specific time windows. Circulatory mortality was also investigated by Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS [...] There were 501 deaths v 471. 3 expected in the cohort. The excess was confined to short term workers and {{did not seem to}} be associated with exposures in the smelter. Analysis of mortality among the 661 men with at least three years employment showed associations between cumulative exposure to tar 40 years before observation and atherosclerotic mortality (P = 0. 03), and between exposure to pot emissions 20 - 39 years before observation and mortality from chronic obstructive lung disease (P = 0. 06). No association was found between exposure to carbon monoxide and mortality from ischaemic heart disease, but cerebrovascular mortality was associated with exposure to pot emissions (P = 0. 02). Results for atherosclerotic and cerebrovascular diseases were confirmed through Poisson regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS [...] The data support previous findings of increased mortality from ischaemic heart disease in workers exposed to tar, and some support is also provided for earlier reports of increased respiratory mortality in potroom workers...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{associations between}} cancer incidence {{and exposure to}} coal tar pitch volatiles, asbestos, pot emissions (<b>fluorides,</b> <b>sulphur</b> dioxide), heat stress, and magnetic fields in workers from a Norwegian aluminium smelter that operated from 1914 to 1975. METHODS [...] Cancer incidence between 1953 and 1991 was recorded in a cohort of 1137 men hired between 1922 and 1975. The expected number of cancer cases was calculated from incidence rates in Norwegian men. A job exposure matrix with semiquantitative exposure estimates was used to investigate associations between cumulative exposure estimates was used to investigate associations between cumulative exposure and cancer incidence through exploring temporal relations by considering exposures only within specific time windows. RESULTS [...] A significant excess of cancer cases, 90 observed v 59. 0 expected, was found in workers who had been employed for less than three years. No such excess was found in men with at least three years' employment, with 120 cases observed v 129. 7 expected. In this subcohort an association {{was found between the}} incidence of bladder cancer and exposure to coal tar pitch volatiles 40 years or more before each person-year under observation, and between incidence of lung cancer and tar exposure 35 - 50 years before observation. An association was also found between incidence of kidney cancer and exposure to heat stress 20 - 35 years before observation. CONCLUSIONS [...] The results support previous findings that exposure to coal tar pitch volatiles in the aluminium industry has been associated with increased risk of bladder and lung cancer. They also add information about temporal relations, suggesting that exposure to tar in this smelter has acted on an early stage in the development of these cancers, followed by a latency period of 30 - 40 years...|$|R
40|$|Titanium has for a {{long time}} been the implant {{material}} of choice when in need for abilities as strength, biocompatibility and stability. Although numbers of studies have been done, {{little is known about the}} early events in implant healing. The primary aim in this thesis was to develop methods for evaluating bone healing around implants. We used common histological methods but also time-of-flight secondary mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) to evaluate the implant healing. This method has previously been used for inorganic materials but can, thanks to new ion sources, be efficiently utilized for analysis of biological compounds. With the Bi 3 + cluster ion source used, it is possible to detect high mass fragments of hydroxyapatite (HA) which was applied in the last paper. HA within an area of 40 µm from the implant was measured and a correlation between histology and TOF-SIMS was found. We think that TOF-SIMS as a method may be suitable for studying high mass HA fragments. The interface zone was another area we wanted to elucidate using TOF-SIMS technique. Bone formation and resorption and the relationship between those two during the first weeks have been of interest in this thesis. Our hypothesis is that understanding of the bone resorption phase could be a crucial step in influencing the bone healing around implants. After 7 days bone was in close contact with the implant but from this day and evident after 14 days resorption was seen. The initially formed bone was then resorbed and replaced by mature lamellar bone. Our findings indicate that healing around implants starts primarily in the periphery growing toward the implant. Early callus formation and resorption are crucial steps in these early phases and possibly the net bone production is influenced by these factors. Findings in the fourth paper indicate that magnesium coatings decrease resorption and increase net bone production. Porosity together with Magnesium coating seems to positively influence bone growth. We detected formation of adhering bone around all the implants after 7 days through measuring HA. After 4 days there was a zone at the interface without mineralization despite light microscopy (LM) detected bone formation. This has not been reported before. Decalcification and sectioning were used in one paper which gave an opportunity to study the relation between bone and the titanium implant in thin sections giving a good LM resolution. The most porous surface only had the third highest HA coating which indicated that other factors influence implant healing except porosity. TOF-SIMS was used pre implantation to characterize the surfaces. It was then possible to see that during the oxidation process different compounds, like <b>sulphur,</b> phosphor and <b>fluoride,</b> are built into the oxide...|$|R
