5|$|Soviet leader Joseph Stalin {{fell ill}} with {{smallpox}} {{at the age}} of seven. His face was badly <b>scarred</b> <b>by</b> the disease. He later had photographs retouched to make his pockmarks less apparent.|$|E
5|$|In particular, he forms a close {{friendship}} with archaeologist James Moon (Kenneth Branagh), another veteran, who like Birkin has been emotionally <b>scarred</b> <b>by</b> the war. Moon is {{employed in the}} village under the same bequest, working to uncover a mysterious lost grave, but {{is more interested in}} discovering the remains of an earlier Saxon church building in the field next to the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|Noachian period (named after Noachis Terra): Formation of {{the oldest}} extant {{surfaces}} of Mars, 4.5 to 3.5 billion years ago. Noachian age surfaces are <b>scarred</b> <b>by</b> many large impact craters. The Tharsis bulge, a volcanic upland, {{is thought to have}} formed during this period, with extensive flooding by liquid water late in the period.|$|E

5|$|Prominent {{families}} {{throughout the}} world often had several people infected by and/or perish from the disease. For example, several relatives of Henry VIII survived the disease but were <b>scarred</b> <b>by</b> it. These include his sister Margaret, Queen of Scotland, his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, and his two daughters: Mary I of England in 1527 and Elizabeth I of England in 1562 (as an adult she would often try to disguise the pockmarks with heavy makeup). His great-niece, Mary, Queen of Scots, contracted the disease as a child but had no visible scarring.|$|E
5|$|Signs of {{the battle}} are still widely {{apparent}} in Vukovar, where many buildings remain visibly <b>scarred</b> <b>by</b> bullets and shrapnel. The riverside water tower has been preserved in its badly damaged state as a memorial. The town hospital presents an exhibition and reconstruction of the conditions in the building during the battle. At Ovčara, {{the site of the}} massacre is marked by a mass grave and exhibition about the atrocity. Local guides, some of whom lived through the battle, offer tourists the opportunity to visit these and other sites on walking and bicycle tours.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{exhausted}} the JNA {{and proved}} {{a turning point}} in the Croatian war. A ceasefire was declared a few weeks later. Vukovar remained in Serb hands until 1998, when it was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia. It has since been rebuilt but has less than half of its pre-war population and many buildings are still <b>scarred</b> <b>by</b> the battle. Its two principal ethnic communities remain deeply divided and it has not regained its former prosperity.|$|E

40|$|Infiltration of old <b>scars</b> <b>by</b> sarcoidal {{granuloma}} is not uncommon. However, pathogenesis of scar sarcoid is not clear. Peculiar {{involvement of}} {{road traffic accident}} scars with sparing of postoperative <b>scar</b> <b>by</b> granulomatous infiltrate in our patient suggests that foreign body contamination is essential {{in the evolution of}} scar sariod. Scar sarcoid can have systemic involvement at the outset in contradistinction to earlier reports as illustrated in our patient. Corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of these patients...|$|R

5|$|Fury, Javier and his witchbreed {{launch a}} {{successful}} attack on Count Doom's fortress. The Four of the Fantastick are freed, and Doom is horribly <b>scarred</b> <b>by</b> {{what he believes}} is the Templar's treasure; in fact, Donal's walking stick is the true treasure, and using it Donal becomes the Norse god Thor. Having nowhere else to go, the ship of fugitives heads for the New World. In Spain, Enrique, the Inquisitor who has killed so many witchbreed, is exposed as a witchbreed himself and sentenced to be {{burned at the stake}} with his young acolytes, Petros and Sister Wanda. Enrique breaks their bonds and they escape on a ship of their own, also bound for America.|$|E
5|$|The airport area to {{the east}} of Honiara was the site of a battle between the United States and the Japanese during the Guadalcanal Campaign in World War II, the Battle of Henderson Field of 1942, from which America emerged victorious. After Honiara became the new {{administrative}} centre of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate in 1952 with the addition of many administrative buildings, the town began to develop and grow in population. Since the late 1990s, Honiara has suffered a turbulent history of ethnic violence and political unrest and is <b>scarred</b> <b>by</b> rioting. A coup attempt in June 2000 resulted in violent rebellions and fighting between the ethnic Malaitans of the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) and the Guadalcanal natives of the Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM).|$|E
5|$|In London, M assigns Bond to {{investigate}} the attack. He flies to Saint Petersburg to meet CIA operative Jack Wade, who suggests that Bond meet with Valentin Zukovsky, a former KGB agent and business rival of Janus. Zukovsky arranges a meeting between Bond and Janus. Onatopp surprises Bond at the Grand Hotel Europe and attempts to kill him, but he overpowers her. She takes Bond to Janus, who reveals himself as Trevelyan; he faked his death at Arkhangelsk but was badly <b>scarred</b> <b>by</b> the explosion. A descendant of the Cossack clans who collaborated with the Nazi forces in the Second World War, Trevelyan had vowed revenge against the British after they betrayed the Cossacks, which drove his father to kill Trevelyan's mother and himself. Just as Bond is about to shoot Trevelyan, Bond is shot with a tranquilizer dart.|$|E

5|$|Loretta drunkenly teaches Nancy Hayton, Zoe Carpenter (Zoë Lister), Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby) and Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) how {{to dance}} in the Student Union bar. She slips and falls onto some glass bottles which break and cut her stomach. Loretta is horrified when she is left <b>scarred</b> <b>by</b> the glass. Her boss sacks her, because her scars have {{rendered}} her unattractive, and Loretta is given a job in Tan & Tumble by Ash Roy (Junade Khan). Loretta develops a crush on Ravi Roy which makes his brother Ash jealous. After Loretta catches Ravi being violent towards his sister Leila (Lena Kaur) she distances herself from him and Ash starts flirting with her. Ash kisses Loretta and Ravi sees it and lashes out at. This leads an angry Ravi to fight in an illegal boxing match. After Ravi taunts Ash he punches Ravi, who was diagnosed with an aneurysm, and Ravi falls into a coma. Loretta explains to Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy) and Anita Roy (Saira Choudhry) that Ash tried to kiss her, which Kris believes and Ash tries to deny.|$|E
5|$|No further {{military}} use {{was made}} of the bunker and the land on which it stands reverted to private ownership. It was left abandoned for many years before the owners decided to redevelop the site. In 1973, the bunker was opened to the public for the first time under the name of Le Blockhaus d'Éperlecques. The ownership was taken over by Hubert de Mégille in the mid-1980s and on 3 September 1986 the French state declared it a monument historique. The area around the bunker has been re-forested, though it is still heavily <b>scarred</b> <b>by</b> bomb craters, and various items of Second World War military equipment (including a V-1 on a launch ramp) are on display alongside paths around the site. An open-air trail leads to and around the bunker with interpretative signs posted at various points {{to tell the story of}} the site and the German V-weapons programme. In 2009, the museum welcomed 45,000 visitors.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina's first {{possession}} of the second overtime period ended with a turnover, while Kansas missed a long jump shot in theirs. North Carolina's Brennan boxed out Chamberlain who went over Brennan to collect the rebound and was called for over the back. Joe Quigg turned the ball over after traveling, while Chamberlain threw {{the ball out of}} bounds on the subsequent possession. Carolina failed to capitalize on Chamberlain's error when Kearns missed the front end of a one–and–one. Kansas came down the court and passed the ball to Chamberlain who was then fouled hard by Cunningham. This sparked an altercation between the two teams, which resulted in Chamberlain being hit in the stomach with a megaphone and his knee being <b>scarred</b> <b>by</b> a Carolina cheerleader. The referees stopped the commotion and Chamberlain was sent to the line, where he missed his shots, and Carolina got the rebound. The Tar Heels aimed to hold the ball for a final shot but they turned the ball over to Kansas with ten seconds to go and the Jayhawks called a timeout with six seconds left. The ball went to Kansas' Loneski who missed a shot and the game remained tied at 48.|$|E

40|$|Using {{longitudinal}} {{data from the}} Dutch Labor Force Supply Panel (OSA), this article examines how unemployment scarring (i. e., wage setbacks following unemployment) and its underlying mechanisms operate across gender in the Netherlands over the period 1985 - 2000. A series of fixed effect panel models that correct for unobserved heterogeneity, reveal a notable disparity in unemployment <b>scarring</b> <b>by</b> gender. Interestingly, while unemployment scarring is short-lived and partly conditional upon human capital differences among women, it is strongly persistent among men and contingent upon old age, ethnicity, and tight economic conditions. Our findings provide new evidence regarding unemployment <b>scarring</b> <b>by</b> gender while they {{support the hypothesis that}} among women the effects of unemployment scarring are predominantly driven by human capital depreciation, while among men stigma effects dominate...|$|R
5|$|The Indian {{independence}} movement developed {{roots in the}} city when Mahatma Gandhi established two ashrams– the Kochrab Ashram near Paldi in 1915 and the Satyagraha Ashram (now Sabarmati Ashram) {{on the banks of}} the Sabarmati in 1917– which would become centres of nationalist activities. During the mass protests against the Rowlatt Act in 1919, textile workers burned down 51 government buildings across the city in protest at a British attempt to extend wartime regulations after the First World War. In the 1920s, textile workers and teachers went on strike, demanding civil rights and better pay and working conditions. In 1930, Gandhi initiated the Salt Satyagraha from Ahmedabad by embarking from his ashram on the Dandi Salt March. The city's administration and economic institutions were rendered inoperative in the early 1930s by the large numbers of people who took to the streets in peaceful protests, and again in 1942 during the Quit India Movement. Following independence and the partition of India in 1947, the city was <b>scarred</b> <b>by</b> the intense communal violence that broke out between Hindus and Muslims in 1947, Ahmedabad was the focus for settlement by Hindu migrants from Pakistan, who expanded the city's population and transformed its demographics and economy.|$|E

30|$|Each {{tree was}} {{harvested}} at a stump height of 0.15 m in 1995. We cut a tree round {{at the base}} of each harvested tree. We sanded each round to prepare it for tree ring analysis. Each round was aged by counting the annual rings along two radii under microscopic observation. There was at least one fire scar on approximately 50 % of the trees sampled. Following the procedure described by McBride (1983), we identified fire <b>scars</b> <b>by</b> visual observation of disruption and healing patterns on the tree rounds. We determined the year of the <b>scarring</b> <b>by</b> the age of the annual ring where the scarring was observed. We used the Fire History Analysis and Exploration System (FHAES) to graph fire scars and to calculate MFI and associated statistical parameters (Grissino-Mayer 2001).|$|R
