2500|$|The {{main body}} of copper ore formed between two {{geological}} faults in broken dolomite rocks. The ore body was up to 70metres(230ft) wide and mainly consisted of green malachite and blue azurite veins and nodules amongst the host rock. The malachite and azurite were formed from copper sulphide minerals, by {{a process known as}} [...] "secondary enrichment". This process took millions of years to convert the low grade copper <b>sulphide</b> <b>ore,</b> which was probably created 300 to 400 millions of years ago during the last period of vulcanism near Burra.|$|E
50|$|Mining of the <b>Sulphide</b> <b>ore</b> deposit will be {{the same}} as surface mining method used during the Gossan Phase. The overall surface mine area will {{encompass}} approximately 26 ha. This includes portions of the Gossan Surface Mine which is outside the boundaries of the <b>Sulphide</b> <b>ore</b> reserve and the <b>Sulphide</b> <b>ore</b> reserve underlying the Gossan surface mine. Mining of the <b>Sulphide</b> <b>ore</b> will require excavation depths ranging from less than 1 m to approximately 60 m.Production capacity is 1,850 tonnes per day of ore, with a request to increase this to 2,500 tonnes per day. Total material moved has averaged 3,800 tonnes per day and will peak at 6,700 tonnes per day in 2012 (based on the current mining plan to 2013). The operating fleet of the mine (including both TVIRD and contractor owned) includes 54 haul trucks, 9 excavators, six bulldozers, and four loaders.|$|E

50|$|The new smelter {{was blown}} in September 1910, {{a month after}} the first train arrived, and it ran well, {{producing}} 2040 tons of blister copper {{by the end of the}} year. The new smelting plant made it possible to cope with low-grade <b>sulphide</b> <b>ores</b> at Mount Elliott. The use of 1000 tons of low-grade <b>sulphide</b> <b>ores</b> bought from the Hampden Consols Mine in 1911 made it clear that if a supply of higher sulphur ore could be obtained and blended, performance and economy would improve. Accordingly, the company bought a number of smaller mines in the district in 1912.|$|R

50|$|The mine then {{experienced}} {{problems when}} <b>sulphide</b> <b>ores</b> containing arsenic and copper were found {{and the entire}} plant had {{to be shut down}} and reorganised to a dry crushing and roasting plant.

40|$|Thiobacillus ferrooxidans {{oxidized}} the sulphide minerals e. g., pyrite, pyrrhotite {{and copper}} concentrate under anaerobic {{conditions in the}} presence of ferric ion as sole electron acceptor. Copper and iron were solubilized from <b>sulphide</b> <b>ores</b> by the sulphur (sulphide) -dependent ferric-ion oxidoreductase activity. Treatment of resting cells of T. ferrooxidans with 0. 5 % phenol for 30  min completely destroyed the iron- and copper-solubilizing activity. The above treatment destroyed the sulphur(sulphide) -dependent ferric-ion-reducing activity completely but did not affect the iron-oxidizing activity. The results suggest that sulphur(sulphide) -dependent ferric-ion-reducing activity actively participates in the oxidation of sulphide minerals under anaerobic conditions. The activity of sulphur(sulphide) -dependent ferric ion reduction in the solubilization of iron and copper from the <b>sulphide</b> <b>ores</b> were also observed under aerobic conditions in presence of sodium azide (0. 1  μmol), which completely inhibits the iron-oxidizing activity...|$|R

40|$|From Chapter 1 : It {{has been}} a long {{standing}} belief that many nickel <b>sulphide</b> <b>ores</b> are derivatives of magmatic processes in ultramafic and mafic rocks, and that they segregate from these magmas as immiscible sulphide droplets which are then concentrated into an orebody by gravitational settling either during intrusion or extrusion, or during the early stages of crystallization of the magma (Naldrett, 1981). Some geologists however, have suggested alternative mechanisms to explain the concentration of nickeliferous sulphides in the mafic and ultramafic hosts. These include hydrothermal replacement (Fleet, 1977), exhalative volcanic processes (Lusk, 1976), or major metamorphic upgrading of low grade, initially magmatic deposits (Barrett et al., 1977). It is not {{the purpose of this study}} to verify or disprove these hypotheses, but in so far as the initial concentration of sulphides in most deposits is concerned, these effects are relatively unimportant (Naldrett, 1981). The nickel <b>sulphide</b> <b>ores</b> associated with these mafic and ultramafic host rocks, invariably consist of nickeliferous pyrrhotite as the dominant phase, together with lesser, but variable, amounts of magnetite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, cubanite, and platinum group elements (Reynolds, 1982) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{petrogenesis}} of <b>sulphide</b> <b>ores</b> in the O’okiep {{district has}} remained controversial. Based {{mainly on the}} concentration of chalcophile metals (PGE, Cu, Ni), it is proposed that the sulphides segregated from a basaltic magma generated during melting of sub-continental lithospheric mantle. Sulphide saturation of the magma was delayed due to relatively high fO 2 until crustal contamination occurred during the advanced stages of differentiation. The immiscible sulphide melt was entrained and fractionated in dynamic magma conduits. Sulphides enriched in monosulphide solid solution (mss) component precipitated at depth in the Kliprand area of southern Namaqualand to form the Hondekloof deposits, whereas the O’okiep ores crystallised at shallower levels from highly fractionated residual sulphide liquids enriched in intermediate solid solution (iss). Sulphides of intermediate composition occur at Ezelsfontein. In {{the context of this}} model, the O’okiep intrusions could represent the proximal magmatic members of an IOCG suite of deposits, raising the prospect for additional IOCG deposits elsewhere in southern Africa. The model also predicts an enhanced potential at O’okiep for undiscovered Ni <b>sulphide</b> <b>ores</b> at depth...|$|R
