2500|$|Although {{the basic}} {{design of the}} ship was based on {{existing}} Seabee ships with a capacity of 38 1,000-ton lighters, Yulius Fuchik was designed for 26 slightly different [...] "Danube-Sea barges" [...] weighing 1,300 tons each. Both the lower deck and the 'tweendeck could accommodate eight [...] barges, two side-by-side, while the longer weather deck had enough space for ten barges, each capable of carrying 1,070 tons of cargo. The barges were moved longitudinally in the cargo holds on remote-controlled platforms. Although the bottom deck, located [...] below the waterline at maximum draught, was protected by a watertight <b>stern</b> <b>door,</b> flooding it while the ship was underway would not have compromised {{the stability of the}} vessel.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose we'd better {{wait and}} find out what the umpires will say. The Admiral won't be exactly pleased." [...] Captain Malan spoke very soothingly. Moorshed looked out through the <b>stern</b> <b>door</b> at Two Six Seven. Pyecroft and I, at attention, studied the {{paintwork}} opposite. Captain Panke had dropped into his desk chair, and scribbled nervously at a blotting-pad.|$|E
50|$|MV Hero was a roll-on/roll-off {{cargo ferry}} which sunk in the North Sea {{in bad weather}} in November 1977, {{with the loss of}} one crew member, when the <b>stern</b> <b>door</b> lost {{watertight}} integrity. The Hero′s pumps could not remove the volumes of water.|$|E
50|$|In 1973 Clansman had bow and <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> fitted, {{allowing}} full ro-ro operation.|$|R
5000|$|Captained by the 55-year-old James Ferguson, {{the vessel}} left Stranraer's railway loading pier at 07:45 AM with 44 tons of cargo, 128 {{passengers}} and 51 crew. Captain Ferguson {{had served as}} master on various ferries on the same route for 17 years. A gale warning was in force but he {{made the decision to}} put to sea. Loch Ryan is a sheltered inlet and the immediate force of the wind and sea was not apparent, but it was noted that spray was breaking over the <b>stern</b> <b>doors.</b> A [...] "guillotine door" [...] had been fitted, because of a previously identified problem with spray and waves hitting the <b>stern</b> <b>doors,</b> but it was rarely used, because it took too long to raise and lower. This would have provided extra protection for the sliding <b>stern</b> <b>doors.</b> On this occasion it was not lowered.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2001, {{the driver}} of an 18 tonne lorry (loaded with 12 tonnes of fresh fish) failed to put his {{vehicles}} handbrake on during a crossing of the Stena Discovery from Hoek van Holland to Harwich. As the ferry accelerated, the lorry rolled back, crashed through the vessels <b>stern</b> <b>doors,</b> and plunged into the North Sea. It took along with it three smaller vans {{as well as one}} of the <b>stern</b> <b>doors.</b> The vessel returned to Hoek van Holland and was taken out of service for repairs. Damage to the door and loss of the vehicles was estimated to be in the region of £200,000.|$|R
50|$|In 1928 she {{was sold}} to Townsend Bros and {{converted}} into a car ferry between Dover and Calais, fitted with a <b>stern</b> <b>door</b> which folded down onto the quay. However, this was unusable, and the cars were craned on. She could carry 165 passengers and 26 cars. Two general saloons, a ladies’ saloon and three private state rooms were constructed.|$|E
50|$|Pictures {{released}} by Brittany Ferries show the ship will have double deck vehicle access at {{the bow and}} stern to decks 3 and 5 though while on her usual route loading of deck 5 will be via an internal ramp {{due to lack of}} double deck facilities at Plymouth or Roscoff. The <b>stern</b> <b>door</b> will be narrower than the one fitted to the Cotentin.|$|E
50|$|The Straitsman was a Bass Strait 720-ton roll-on/roll-off ferry {{livestock}} carrier which capsized and sank in the Yarra River, Melbourne, Australia, on 23 March 1974 while approaching her berth with her vehicle door partly open, {{with the loss}} of two crew members and many of her cargo of 2,000 sheep. The ferry was heading upstream at 6 knots (7 mph; 11 km/hr) when a crew member opened the <b>stern</b> <b>door</b> without the knowledge of the captain on the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|The {{others were}} based on Hitachi Shipbuilding Corporation's {{standard}} 8,000-ton, [...] Type-M cargo steam ship modified (Type-MB) to carry twelve Toku-Daihatsu class landing craft launched through <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> with funnels installed horizontally on the starboard side to accommodate a flight deck.|$|R
50|$|His ship, the {{destroyer}} HMS Contest, was at Rothesay when it {{picked up a}} distress signal. The ferrys <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> had been ripped open by a storm, and water had flooded the car deck. When Contest arrived the ferry had already sunk, but McArdle and Chief Petty Officer Wilfred Warren managed to pluck several survivors to safety.|$|R
5000|$|The HSS {{class of}} ferries were {{designed}} to allow quick turnarounds at port. A specially designed linkspan provided ropeless mooring and allowed quick loading, unloading and servicing. Vehicles were loaded via {{two of the four}} <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> and parked in a [...] "U" [...] configuration. When disembarking, vehicles drove straight off via the other two doors.|$|R
50|$|A refit {{during her}} first winter {{improved}} passenger accommodation. Reclining chairs were added in the forward and aft lounges and partitions added between the restaurant and bar areas. In 2004, a major refit allowed her to carry a full capacity of 636 passengers. A new accommodation section containing the Legends café/bar, Niarbyl Quiet Lounge and toilets was added. The refit also created an outside deck space and modified the vessel's <b>stern</b> <b>door.</b> Another refit in April 2008, included a new livery and internal refit.|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} {{developed}} and built in the US for the USN and the Royal Navy. The LSD could carry 36 LCM at 16 knots. It had a large open compartment at the back. Opening a <b>stern</b> <b>door</b> and flooding special compartments opened this area to the sea so that LCI-sized vessels could enter or leave. It took {{one and a half}} hours for the dock to be flooded down and two and half to pump it out. When flooded they could also be used as docks for repairs to small craft.|$|E
5000|$|Pride of Hull was {{designed}} as two ships in one, both a car ferry and a cargo transporter, with three large freight decks, loaded by a single <b>stern</b> <b>door</b> and a car deck, on deck 7, loaded via a side ramp. She is 215.05 m long with a beam of 31.85 m and a draught of 6.04 m. She is powered by four Wärtsilä 9L46C diesel engines which have a total power output of [...] which can propel her at 22 kn. She has two bow thrusters, two stabilisers and twin rudders.|$|E
50|$|RFA Sir Galahad {{was built}} by Swan Hunter and entered service in 1988. She was named and given the {{identical}} pennant number to the Sir Galahad sunk in the Falklands War. Built as a combined landing craft and ferry with two flight decks for helicopters and bow and <b>stern</b> <b>doors,</b> there was capacity for around 400 troops and 3,440 tonnes of supplies.|$|R
50|$|On 28 January 2009, a lorry {{carrying}} {{ferrous sulphate}} powder {{burst through the}} <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> of the Stena Voyager shortly after departure. Because of this, the ferry {{had to return to}} Stranraer. Subsequent sailings were postponed. The cause of the accident was the driver of the lorry failing to park it in gear and to apply the handbrake. The vehicle was insufficiently secured to the ship's deck.|$|R
50|$|The ships {{had both}} bow and <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> leading onto the main vehicle deck, making them roll-on/roll-off, {{combined}} with ramps {{that led to}} upper and lower vehicle decks. Thanks to their shallow draught, they could beach themselves and use the bow doors for speedy unloading of troops and equipment. The ships also had helicopter decks on both the upper vehicle deck and behind the superstructure.|$|R
50|$|In {{her initial}} configuration, the ship could carry 190 passengers: 140 in single- or double-berth cabins, {{the rest in}} aircraft-style {{reclining}} chairs. 110 cars could be carried in covered parking, with room for an additional 15 in peak conditions, split between the cargo hold and the orlop deck. Larger vehicles (such as semi-trailers) or specially designed shipping containers could be stored on the open aft deck. A <b>stern</b> <b>door</b> allowed for the embarking and disembarking of vehicles. Public amenities onboard included an observation lounge, smoke room and bar, tavern, and a cafeteria (which initially only sold breakfast).|$|E
5000|$|A £3 million refit, {{carried out}} by Burgess Marine in Portsmouth, {{provided}} a new aft accommodation module and the [...] "Sky Lounge". The heavy military ramp was replaced with a new <b>stern</b> <b>door</b> and the helideck was removed. Following this, she arrived in Douglas on 11 May 2009. An open day took place {{at each of the}} Company's ports and at a renaming ceremony, she was renamed after Manannán mac Lir, the Celtic god of the Irish sea. Manannan made her maiden service voyage with the Steam Packet Company on Friday 22 May 2009 on the 07:30 sailing from Douglas to Liverpool.|$|E
50|$|Nantucket was {{originally}} designed with loading {{doors in the}} extreme bow and stern, so that cars and trucks could drive on {{at one end of}} the freight deck and off at the other. The bow doors proved unusable, however, and were welded shut early in the vessel's operational career. Thereafter, cars and trucks were loaded through the <b>stern</b> <b>door,</b> or through a door cut into the starboard (right) side of the vessel just behind the bow. Both methods complicated and slowed the loading process, and required Nantucket to always back into its slip. The vessel was thus more difficult to keep on schedule than subsequent ferries, which allowed vehicles to drive straight on and straight off.|$|E
5000|$|The HSS {{class of}} ferries were {{designed}} to allow quick turnarounds at port, in 30 minutes or less. A specially designed linkspan for the Stena HSS provides ropeless mooring and allows quick loading, unloading and servicing. Vehicles are loaded via {{two of the four}} <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> and park in a [...] "U" [...] configuration. When disembarking, vehicles drive straight off via the other two doors.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} ferry, former Caledonian MacBrayne vessel MV Iona, {{was purchased}} in October 1997 and renamed Pentalina-B. The first drive-through MacBrayne ferry with both bow and <b>stern</b> <b>doors,</b> she carried around 50 cars, or 4-5 articulated lorries and fewer cars. During the off-seasons since 2006, she was chartered out, carrying livestock across the channel from Dover and providing freight relief for CalMac. She {{was sold to}} an owner in Cape Verde in late 2009.|$|R
5000|$|The Ropucha (toad), or Project 775 class landing {{ships are}} {{classified}} in the Russian Navy as [...] "large landing craft" [...] (Bol'shoy Desantnyy Korabl). They were built in Poland in the Stocznia Północna shipyards, in Gdańsk. They are designed for beach landings and can carry a 450-ton cargo. The ships have both bow and <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> for loading and unloading vehicles, and the 630 m² of vehicle deck stretches {{the length of the}} hull. Up to 25 armored personnel carriers can be embarked.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the basic}} {{design of the}} ship was based on {{existing}} Seabee ships with a capacity of 38 1,000-ton lighters, Yulius Fuchik was designed for 26 slightly different [...] "Danube-Sea barges" [...] weighing 1,300 tons each. Both the lower deck and the 'tweendeck could accommodate eight 38 m barges, two side-by-side, while the longer weather deck had enough space for ten barges, each capable of carrying 1,070 tons of cargo. The barges were moved longitudinally in the cargo holds on remote-controlled platforms. Although the bottom deck, located 0.8 m below the waterline at maximum draught, was protected by a watertight <b>stern</b> <b>door,</b> flooding it while the ship was underway would not have compromised {{the stability of the}} vessel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cruise line}} was founded as Norwegian Caribbean Line in 1966 by Knut Kloster and Ted Arison, with the 8,666-ton, 140m cruise ship/car ferry, , which in 1966 {{operated}} as a car-ferry between Southampton UK and Gibraltar, for that one, short season only. Arison soon left to form Carnival Cruise Lines, while Kloster acquired additional ships for Caribbean service. Norwegian pioneered many firsts in the cruise industry like: the first Out Island Cruise, the first combined air-sea program (marketed as [...] "Cloud 9 Cruises") which combined low cost air fares with the cruise, first shipline {{to develop new}} ports in the Caribbean, like Ocho Rios in Jamaica. Like the original Sunward of 1966, Norwegians's second ship, the Starward had the capability to carry automobiles through a well concealed <b>stern</b> <b>door.</b> Later, this area was turned into cabins and a two deck movie theater, which is now a casino. Norwegian was responsible {{for many of the}} cruise innovations that have now become standard throughout the industry.|$|E
50|$|Hull {{form for}} the vessel was {{developed}} based on a semi displacement hard chine form, flared forward in combination of built in spray rail to further improve the vessel's performance and planing at high speeds. The hull was initially developed and designed by Tenix using hydrostatics software Maxsurf and later sent to the Maritime Research Institute (MARIN) for review, which confirmed the predicted performance of the vessel. Seakeeping features includes sustained speeds of 12 knots in Sea State 4. Hull is of all-welded construction with grade 250 steel with aluminum superstructure including flight deck. <b>Stern</b> <b>door</b> constructed of aluminum alloy to reduce weight. Main propulsion consists of two medium speed Caterpillar 3612, producing 4,060 bkW at 1,000 rpm mounted with a flexible coupling connecting the flywheel to a clutchable Reintjes LAF 3445 reduction gearbox, gearbox ratio 2.515:1. The gearbox is hard mounted with a horizontally offset output driving a shaft line connected to acbLips four-bladed (Hub 4D710D) controllable-pitch propeller. Each propulsion train and ancillary systems are capable of operating independently. Port reduction gearbox provides a power take-off connection for the fire monitor pump which are used alongside firefighting capability. Main engines and auxiliaries are fueled by 109,762 liters of diesel, sufficient for an operational range of 1,000 nm at speeds of 24 knots and 2,000 nm at speeds of 15 knots, both with 10% remaining fuel. Electrical power is supplied by two Caterpillar 3406 generators sets each provides 260 ekW located in the forward area of the engine room. The design allows for the complete electric power demand to be supplied with only one generator. Emergency Caterpillar 3306 harbor generator located at main deck aft provides 105 ekW in case of main generator failure. The emergency set is air cooled and configured for automatic startup on loss of the ships main power. Main engine room is protected with a carbon dioxide extinguishing system. Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) is provided for protection of the flight deck via a mixed foam tank and proportioners. Electronics includes Furuno GPS with Furuno ARPA 26 plotter, Furuno X and S band radars, Furuno depth sounder, Furuno 8000 GMDSS, Furuno Inmarsat B and C Satcom, Furuno FAX 2084 weatherfax, Tokimec 110GS gyrocompass and Tokimec PR 2213 autopilot. Flight deck located on the after end of the bridge deck can support a helicopter for airborne SAR or emergency evacuation, with a maximum weight of 4,672 kg (10,728 lb). Weapons hardpoints located at the bow can mount heavier caliber guns, which was specified by the PCG.|$|E
2500|$|Hei-type {{landing craft}} {{carriers}} included a flight deck with {{a capacity for}} 28 aircraft, but no hangar deck, since the deck beneath the flight deck was used to carry 25 landing craft launched through <b>stern</b> <b>doors.</b> Akisu Maru was completed in time {{to participate in the}} invasion of Java; but she and the other Hei-types were thereafter used primarily as ferries to transport short-range aircraft to distant bases. The first two were completed from 11,800-ton, [...] Nippon Kaiun, K. K. passenger ships under construction by Harima Shipbuilding. They operated two Kayaba Ka-1 autogyros. Both were sunk by submarines in 1944.|$|R
50|$|Following sale to Loki Shipping, {{the ship}} was radically rebuilt into a {{full-time}} cruise ship at Aalborg Vaerft in Ålborg, Denmark between August 1981 and April 1982. The lower car deck was built in with cabins, and new penthouse suites were added on the top deck. The existing cabins were enlarged, so that the ship could accommodate just 515 passengers. With {{the elimination of the}} car deck the <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> were sealed, a bulbous bow replaced the original icebreaker bow, and sponsons were fitted aft to increase stability. Following this reconstruction {{the ship was}} renamed Pearl of Scandinavia.|$|R
5000|$|Hei-type {{landing craft}} {{carriers}} included a flight deck with {{a capacity for}} 28 aircraft, but no hangar deck, since the deck beneath the flight deck was used to carry 25 landing craft launched through <b>stern</b> <b>doors.</b> Akisu Maru was completed in time {{to participate in the}} invasion of Java; but she and the other Hei-types were thereafter used primarily as ferries to transport short-range aircraft to distant bases. The first two were completed from 11,800-ton, 20 kn Nippon Kaiun, K. K. passenger ships under construction by Harima Shipbuilding. They operated two Kayaba Ka-1 autogyros. Both were sunk by submarines in 1944.|$|R
5000|$|MS Nindawayma’s {{decommissioning}} from Canadian service {{after four}} years of use {{is said to have been}} due to [...] "unsatisfactory performance". There was a distinct smell of diesel fuel at deck level, possibly due to her low-set twin funnels. (Photos of her in Canadian service show that the funnel-top smoke deflectors had been removed.) Her French Pielstick diesel engines were apparently troublesome, and sailings were canceled due to mechanical problems. Her bow and <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> were claimed to not be high enough to accommodate semi-trailer trucks despite this not being a problem in Manx or Spanish service. These factors caused significant numbers of ferry passengers to avoid the MS Nindawayma in favour of the MS Chi-Cheemaun, even if waiting involved very long delays at the ferry terminals in Tobermory and South Baymouth.|$|R
25|$|The Amur-class minelayers were {{designed}} to drop their mines while at high speed and were given a pronounced, overhanging, stern that allowed the mines to be dropped behind the propellers through <b>doors</b> in the <b>stern.</b> Each <b>door</b> was served by a rail that led directly to the mine storage compartments.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the newly}} founded Commodore Cruise Line {{was looking for}} ships to operate on cruises around the Caribbean. An {{agreement}} was reached where the build contract of the half-complete ship was sold to the Sweden-based Wallenius Lines, who would have the ship completed as a cruise ship, and following completion she would be chartered to Commodore Cruise Lines. Following their tradition of naming ships after operas, Wallenius decided to name the ship Bohème, after La bohème. Cabins were added {{in place of the}} car decks on the ship (although bow or <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> were never fitted on her), and her superstructure was redesigned to better accommodate the need for sundeck space in the warmer climates. The Bohème was delivered to Wallenius Bremen, Wallenius Lines' West Germany-based subsidiary, on 12 November 1968. She was registered in West Germany, with Bremerhaven as her home port.|$|R
5000|$|... :"The QUEEN {{has been}} graciously pleased to make undermentioned award :-:GEORGE CROSS.:David BROADFOOT (deceased), Radio Officer, m.v. [...] "Princess Victoria". (Stranraer.):"Princess Victoria" [...] left Stranraer {{on the morning}} of 31st January, 1953, {{carrying}} 127 passengers for Larne. After leaving Loch Ryan she encountered north-westerly gales and squalls of sleet and snow. A heavy sea struck the ship and burst open the <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> and sea water flooded the space on the car deck causing a list to starboard of about 10 degrees. Attempts were made to secure the <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> but without success. The Master tried his ship back to Loch Ryan but the conditions were of such severity that the manoeuvre failed. Some of the ship's cargo shifted from the port to the starboard side and this increased the list as the crippled vessel endeavoured to make her way across the Irish Sea.:From the moment when [...] "Princess Victoria" [...] first got into difficulties, Radio Officer Broadfoot constantly sent out wireless messages giving the ship's position and asking for assistance. The severe list which the vessel had taken, and which was gradually increasing, rendered his task even more difficult. Despite the difficulties and danger he steadfastly continued his work at the transmitting set, repeatedly sending signals to the coast radio station to enable them to ascertain the ship's exact position.:When [...] "Princess Victoria" [...] finally stopped in sight of the Irish Coast her list had increased to 45 degrees. The vessel was practically on her beam ends and the order to abandon ship was given. Thinking only of saving the lives of passengers and crew, Radio Officer Broadfoot remained in the W/T cabin, receiving and sending messages although he must have known that if he did this he had no chance of surviving. The ship finally foundered and Radio Officer Broadfoot went down with her. He had deliberately sacrificed his own life in an attempt to save others." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Court of Enquiry {{into the}} sinking, held in March 1953 at Crumlin Road Courthouse in Belfast, {{found that the}} Princess Victoria was lost due to a {{combination}} of factors. In a report of 30,000 pages the enquiry found that: firstly, the <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> were not sufficiently robust. Secondly, arrangements for clearing water from the car deck were inadequate. The report concluded [...] "If the Princess Victoria had been as staunch as those who manned her, then all would have been well and the disaster averted." [...] The court also noted the failure of the duty destroyer [...] from the 3rd Training Squadron, based at [...] at Londonderry Port {{to be able to put}} to sea, as too many men had been released on shore leave. As a consequence of the enquiry, the duty destroyer from the 3rd Squadron was subsequently based [...] "on station" [...] at the mouth of Lough Foyle on 1 hour readiness to put to sea.|$|R
2500|$|On 11 January 1990, Channel Entente {{arrived at}} Douglas, Isle of Man for {{berthing}} trials. On 5 February 1990 she was reflagged to the Bahamas, with Nassau as her port of registry. The call sign FNKC was allocated. She {{was sold to}} Vessel Holdings Ltd, Nassau, on 9 February and then sold to the IoMSPCo, Douglas on 14 February. She entered service on the Douglas [...] - Heysham route on 19 February, serving until 27 September when she was sent to Messrs Wright & Beyer, Birkenhead for a refit. during the refit, her passenger accommodation was extended and vehicle side-loading doors were fitted. An additional bow thruster was fitted. During her time with the IoMSPCo, the rails were filled in and the buffers were removed. On 8 December 1990, Channel Entente was renamed King Orry, she re-entered service on the Douglas - Heysham and Douglas - Liverpool routes on 9 December. King Orry was fitted with <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> in 1992. In February 1995, King Orry was reflagged to the Isle of Man, with Douglas as her port of registry. Her last day of service with IoMSPCo was 28 September 1998.|$|R
