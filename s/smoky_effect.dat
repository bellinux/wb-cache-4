2500|$|Altman's {{distinctive}} {{style of}} directing {{carried over into}} his preferences for camerawork. Among them was his use of widescreen compositions, intended to capture the many people or activities taking place on screen at the same time. For some films, such as McCabe and Mrs. Miller, he created a powerful visual atmosphere with cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, such as scenes using fluid camerawork, zoom lenses, and a <b>smoky</b> <b>effect</b> using special fog filters. Director Stanley Kubrick told Altman that [...] "the camerawork was wonderful," [...] and asked, [...] "How did you do it?" ...|$|E
50|$|The culinary use {{of liquid}} {{nitrogen}} is mentioned in an 1890 recipe book titled Fancy Ices authored by Mrs. Agnes Marshall, {{but has been}} employed in more recent times by restaurants {{in the preparation of}} frozen desserts, such as ice cream, which can be created within moments at the table because of the speed at which it cools food. Similarly, liquid nitrogen has become popular in the preparation of cocktails because {{it can be used to}} quickly chill glasses or freeze ingredients. It is also added to drinks to create a <b>smoky</b> <b>effect,</b> which is created by the cold nitrogen vapour (liquid nitrogen boils at -195.8 Celsius at normal atmospheric pressure) condensing the moisture (i.e., water vapor) in the surrounding air above.|$|E

The rapidity of chilling also leads to the formation of smaller ice crystals, which provides the dessert with a smoother texture. The technique is employed by chef Heston Blumenthal who has used it at his restaurant, The Fat Duck to create frozen dishes such as egg and bacon ice cream. Liquid nitrogen has also become popular in the preparation of cocktails because {{it can be used to}} quickly chill glasses or freeze ingredients. It is also added to drinks to create a <b>smoky</b> <b>effect,</b> which occurs as tiny droplets of the liquid nitrogen come into contact with the surrounding air, condensing the vapour that is naturally present.|$|E
5000|$|The ident {{consisted}} of a figure [...] "1" [...] inside a rotating transparent globe surrounded by a swirling smokey atmosphere above the BBC's corporate logo - the bold italic letters B B C within three rhomboids, above blue red and green flashes. The idents were created by filming a physical globe, but used CGI effects to give it its smokey look. The ident had no soundtrack and was played off modified Laserdisc. Upon first impressions, the ident does not appear like a globe, as the <b>smoky</b> CGI <b>effects</b> hide and disfigure the continents. However, land masses {{can be seen in}} the globe and their shadows can be seen on the background of the ident.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 A {{generalized}} {{mathematical model}} of ecosystems is developed. The model {{begins with the}} general class of systems known as state-determined systems, in which the time-derivative of each state variable {{is a function of}} some subset of the set of all system state variables and. environmental parameters. A formal basis is presented for considering the steady-state behavior of such systems in terms of isoclines, drawing upon the fields of graph theory, linear algebra, and differential equations. The simplifying capabilities of hierarchy theory are invoked to mitigate the adverse effects of model complexity. Like the theory of isocline analysis, the particular formulation of hierarchy theory presented is phrased in graph-theoretic terms, enabling the model to be developed as a technique for analyzing the steady-state behavior of hierarchical systems. The role of inter-level time scale heterogeneity in hierarchical organization is discussed. As an illustration of its ability to portray the behavior of spatially-nested hierarchies, the model is used to provide a perspective on data from the climax vegetation of the Great <b>Smoky</b> Mountains. The <b>effects</b> of time scale heterogeneity are also illustrated by using the model to organize data sets from several vegetation/avian communities across the United States. The vegetation is taken to behave with a lower characteristic frequency than the relatively rapidly-developing avian subcommunity, thus constraining the latter in a hierarchical fashion. In order to understand in a more general way the role such a model might play in advancing ecological understanding, a broad framework is presented for analyzing the role of conceptual structures in science and the place of models in these structures. A view of models as scientific metaphors is advanced {{as an alternative to the}} pictorial/realist interpretation of models. Given this understanding of models in general, the proposed model and its underlying assumptions are compared and contrasted with a set of four partial conceptual structures drawn from the fields of systems ecology, plant ecology, natural resource economics, and organismic systems theory...|$|R
