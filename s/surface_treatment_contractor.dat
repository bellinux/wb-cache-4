40|$|Acquiring {{detailed}} {{knowledge of}} <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> effectiveness {{is required to}} improve performance-based decisions for allocating resources to preserve and maintain pavements on any road network. Measurement of treatment effectiveness is a complex task that requires historical records of treatments with observations of before and after performance trends.

This paper analyzes the effect of <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> on asphalt paved arterial roads for several control sections of New Brunswick. The method uses a Transition Probability Matrix to capture main effects by mapping mean trends of surface improvement and pavement structure decay.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of mechanical <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> for excess glass removal on the fracture toughness of a glass infiltrated zirconia toughened alumina "GI-ZTA" disks (In-CeramÂ® Zirconia). The GI-ZTA disks were submitted to three different mechanical <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> after glass infiltration (grinding, sandblasting and grinding/sandblasting/annealing). Fracture toughness was evaluated through indentation fracture (IF) test. Reliability of tests results was accessed through Weibull statistics. Results: Indentation fracture tests (IF) of GI-ZTA disks have shown that grinding was the <b>surface</b> <b>treatment</b> that presented the lowest K Ic and reliability. An annealing treatment after grinding and sandblasting promoted an increase in K Ic, mainly due to monoclinic-tetragonal reverse transformation recovering the tetragonal zirconia lost during the different mechanical <b>surface</b> <b>treatments.</b> The highest K Ic values were observed after sandblasting and grinding/sandblasting/annealing. Significance: The proposed mechanical <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> played an important role on the metastability of tetragonal zirconia and strongly influenced the mechanical performance of GI-ZTA.

The facial surface of these surface treated crowns was utilized as the bonding surface to which 2. 5 mm diameter composite resin cylinders were bonded for the evaluation of the shear bond strength. Shear bond strength measurements were made using a universal testing machine utilizing a shearing blade (jig). The mode of failure at composite-metal interface was determined using a Stereomicroscope at 10 X magnification. Results: The mean bond strength values obtained for <b>surface</b> <b>treatment</b> of Nd: YAG laser surface treated, Sandblasting, Alloy Primer and No <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> were 17. 01 Â±. 92, 13. 18 Â±. 73, 7. 46 Â±. 70 and 7. 33 Â±. 77 MPa respectively.
