50|$|The <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> is {{a target}} for finger strikes in such martial arts as Jiu-Jitsu and Hapkido. In self-defense, a person may thrust their fingers or thumb into the <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch,</b> {{initially}} pushing straight {{to get past the}} increased thickness of the upper portion of the manubrium and then curling their fingers to apply downward pressure. This maneuver is thought to induce choking through blockage by crushing the windpipe, or perhaps have medical implications involving pressure to the aortic arch and surrounding tissues. This maneuver (as a two-finger strike utilizing the middle and index fingers) was choreographed into the subway station fight scene in the movie, The Matrix.|$|E

5000|$|A thyroglossal cyst is a fibrous cyst {{that forms}} from a {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct. Thyroglossal cysts {{can be defined}} as an irregular neck mass or a lump which develops from cells and tissues left over after the formation of the thyroid gland during developmental stages.

These neck masses can occur anywhere along the path of the thyroglossal duct, from the base of the tongue to the <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch.</b> [...] Other common causes of midline neck masses include lymphadenopathy, dermoid cysts, and various odontogenic anomalies.|$|E
50|$|The {{sternoclavicular joint}} or sternoclavicular {{articulation}} is the joint between the manubrium of the sternum and the clavicle bone.

The bone areas entering into its formation are the sternal end of the clavicle, the upper and lateral part of the sternum, (the clavicular notch), and the cartilage of the first rib, visible from the outside as the <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch.</b> The articular surface of the clavicle is much larger {{than that of the}} sternum, and is invested with a layer of cartilage, which is considerably thicker than that on the sternum.|$|E

50|$|The {{shape of}} the chest does not {{correspond}} {{to that part of}} the thoracic skeleton that encloses the heart and lungs.

Level with this line the second ribs join the sternum, and when these are found the lower ribs can often be counted. At {{the lower part of the}} sternum, where the seventh or last true ribs join it, the ensiform cartilage begins, and above this there is often a depression known as the pit of the stomach.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the middle}} line below the chin can be felt {{the body of the}} hyoid bone, just below which is the {{prominence}} of the thyroid cartilage called [...] "Adam's apple", better marked in men than in women.

Still lower the cricoid cartilage is easily felt, while between this and the <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> the trachea and isthmus of the thyroid gland may be made out. At the side the outline of the sternomastoid muscle is the most striking mark; it divides the anterior triangle of the neck from the posterior.

40|$|SUMMARY Two-dimensional <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> {{echocardiography}} {{was performed}} in 1033 patients, ages 1 day to 18 years. For the long-axis <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> view, the transducer was positioned in the <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> and angled to obtain a plane passing between the right nipple and left scapular tip. In this view, the entire aortic arch, vessels to the head and neck, right pulmonary artery and right bronchus were imaged. The long-axis view was useful for evaluating coarctation and interruption of the aorta, hypoplastic left heart, aortic and pulmonic stenosis and cervical aortic arch. For the short-axis <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> view the transducer was posi-tioned in the <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> and angled to obtain a coronal body plane. In this view the transverse aorta, right pulmonary artery, left atrium, innominate veins and superior vena cava were imaged. The short-axis view was useful {{in the evaluation of}} children with increased or decreased pulmonary blood flow, persistent left superior vena cava, total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right superior vena cava, and superior vena caval obstruction after Mustard's operation. In the evaluation of children with congenital heart disease, the <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> views added significant information to the two-dimensional echocardiographic examination.

40|$|Objectives: Current {{clinical}} {{selection criteria}} for mammaplasty use weight-related parameters, {{and weight loss}} is recommended as a nonsurgical intervention to reduce breast size. However, research has not firmly established if breast size is related to body size and composition. This study aims to investigate anthropometric characteristics in smaller and larger breasted women and identify predictors of breast mass. Methods: A bra fitter determined underband and cup size of 93 A to H cup size women (mean ± standard deviation, age 25. 7 ± 5. 6 years, height 1. 67 ± 0. 6 cm, and mass 65. 6 ± 11. 0 kg). Estimations of breast mass (g) were made, and participants were categorized as smaller (500 g) breasted. Restricted anthropometric profiles determined body mass, height, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, sum of eight skinfolds, subscapular to triceps skinfold ratio, somatotype, percent body fat, fat and fat-free mass, and <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> to nipple distance. Results: All variables (excluding height, subscapular to triceps skinfold ratio, and age) were significantly greater in larger breasted women. Body mass-related parameters and <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> to nipple distance were positively related to breast mass, with BMI and <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> to nipple distance accounting for half {{of the variance in}} breast mass. Conclusion:Smaller and larger breasted women demonstrate differences in anthropometry, with body mass and BMI demonstrating strong relationships to breast mass. Measures of BMI and <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> to nipple distance enable predictions of breast mass and suggest that weight-related parameters are not appropriate exclusion criteria for mammaplasty.

The vertical and horizontal distance between the upper central incisor teeth and <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> was measured in 200 supine adult subjects. The maximum vertical and horizontal distance between the upper central incisor teeth and <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> was 9 cm and 21 cm respectively.

40|$|Accurate {{positioning}} of {{the tip of the}} tracheal tube (tube tip) is challenging in young children. Prevalent clinical methods include placement of intubation depth marks, palpation of the tube cuff in the <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch,</b> or deliberate mainstem intubation with subsequent withdrawal. To compare the predictability of tube tip positions, variability of the resulting positions in relation to the carina was determined applying the three techniques in each patient.; In 68 healthy children aged ≤ 4  years, intubation was performed with an age-adapted, high-volume low-pressure cuffed tube adjusting the imprinted depth mark {{to the level of the}} vocal cords. The tube tip-to-carina distance was measured endoscopically. Thereafter, placements using (I) cuff palpation in the <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> and (II) auscultation to determine change in breath sounds during withdrawal after bronchial mainstem intubation were completed in random order.; Tube tip position above the carina was higher when using depth marks (mean =  36. 8  mm) compared with cuff palpation in the <b>suprasternal</b> <b>notch</b> (mean =  19. 0  mm). Variability, expressed as sd, was lowest with the mainstem intubation technique (5. 2  mm) followed by the cuff palpation (7. 4  mm) and the depth mark technique (11. 2  mm) (P <  0. 005).; Auscultation after deliberate mainstem intubation and cuff palpation resulted in a tube tip position above the carina that was shorter and more predictable than placement of the tube using depth markings...|$|E
