40|$|Context. How {{end user}} {{development}} can be enabled and made attainable {{through the use}} of a web based graphical user interface, in systems that contains logic for handling BPMN flows as variation points. Investigated from a UX and usability perspective. Objectives. Designing prototypes of such a web-based interface, and then evaluating the usability with regards to the usability attributes effectiveness and learnability, with the goal finding relevant usability issues & solutions as well as investigating how the two usability attributes affected the participants’ subjective satisfaction. Methods. Two prototype versions were implemented, one based upon the other. A usability inspection (expert evaluation) was performed after the first prototype version (named alpha) was finished and the second version (named beta) was built based on that feedback. The usability of the prototypes were then evaluated in usability test sessions using the think aloud method together with the SUS (System Usability Scale) questionnaire. The recorded data from the usability test sessions was analysed. Usability issues & solutions were noted, filtered, tagged and grouped by design principle with the goal of looking for patterns. SUS scores were calculated from the questionnaires. Additional factor analysis was performed on the SUS data to get separate usability and learnability scores. Results. The results consisted of SUS scores for both prototypes together with learnability and usability scores. Common and noteworthy usability issues & solutions grouped by design principle. Detailed appendixes with scenarios exemplifying recorded video & voice data for four of the most relevant test participants. Conclusions. The two prototypes were compared. Improvements to effectiveness and learnability was found to have a positive impact on the participants’ subjective satisfaction in the described context. Additionally, a number of usability issues and solutions was identified that could be of value when developing similar software. In summary, the following findings were made related to effectiveness: Adding constraints to the number of options available to users helped increase effectiveness. The lack of keyboard shortcuts was a deal breaker for many users and had a negative impact on effectiveness [...] Consistency in navigation was more important than expected. The lack of functionality for saving drafts in the browser, without downloading, was something that most users expected and was surprised not to find. Several users expected their drafts to be automatically saved. They were frustrated when their changes were lost without warning. The lack of an undo function was also a big issue for users, causing problems with recovery. Giving immediate feedback with a notification popup after users had deployed a flow worked well and was easier to implement than expected. The connection tool that ship with bpmn-js was hard to learn and use for several users. Additionally, some learnability related findings: Sandbox intended to boost learnability but caused problems with effectiveness. The BPMN notation was not familiar to the test participants. Some training or introduction would have been necessary in a real usage scenario. When important functionality was concealed in submenus it was harder for users to learn how to operate the editor, specifically a problem with the context pad. Properties panel. Issues with visibility of single items due to tabs being too cluttered. Affordance issues on input/output parameters tab. Consistency issue with the bpmn. io logo being placed in the where users expected a <b>save</b> <b>button.</b> Consistency. Negative impact on learnability due to lack of keyboard shortcuts. Users likely to learn faster if they could use the shortcuts they already know. Placement of the download button not consistent with other webapps. Unconventional to only have drag and drop for upload and no button. Issues with visibility and consistency related to maximizing/minimizing editor in beta prototype. Familiarity findings related to deploy button colour and label might have affected learnability...|$|E
50|$|Brentford {{recorded}} {{their fourth}} straight win against Coventry {{at home on}} 22 March. Callum Wilson put the visitors ahead following a spilled <b>save</b> by David <b>Button,</b> but Donaldson and Trotta both scored to leave the Bees ahead at the break after Alan Judge had missed a penalty. Alan McCormack scored his first league goal for the club with a powerful run and a deft chip over the Coventry goalkeeper. Alan Judge conceded a penalty early into the away game at in-form Rotherham which was converted by Kieran Agard. Agard added a second before half time, and Haris Vuckic confirmed defeat for the Bees {{in the final minute}} of the match. Brentford finished the month with a goalless away draw to Oldham.|$|R

In the second half Gray was brought down in the Norwich box and Alex Pritchard stepped up to convert the penalty giving the Bees the lead. A stunning double <b>save</b> from David <b>Button</b> prevented Norwich equalising and the resulting win moved Brentford up to 4th position in the league.|$|R

Written in 1960, Ende's novel is a classic in Germany and has been translated into 33 languages. In her article, called [...] "Jim <b>Button</b> <b>saves</b> the theory of evolution" [...] ("Jim Knopf rettet die Evolutionstheorie"), Voss presented evidence that Ende wanted to write a contrast to Nazi racial ideology and their misuse of Darwin's theory of evolution. Ende, who had grown up in Nazi Germany, used numerous Nazi symbols and references in his book, reversing their discriminatory aspect and turning them into anti-racist and multi-cultural images. Voss' article also identified Jemmy Button as the basis for Ende's lead character, Jim Knopf, translated in English as Jim Button.|$|R
50|$|Brentford hosted Fulham {{for another}} West London derby, {{a week after}} {{defeating}} Queens Park Rangers. The Bees {{could not find the}} form they showed against Q.P.R. as they suffered a 2-0 defeat. Sone Aluko tapped in the opening goal in the first half after his initial shot was <b>saved</b> by Bentley. <b>Button,</b> who had left Brentford for Fulham in the summer, was rarely tested in goal. As Brentford were pushing for an equaliser, Tom Cairney scored Fulham's second goal on the break late into stoppage time to seal defeat for the Bees. After the international break, Brentford travelled to Ewood Park to face Blackburn Rovers. It was a frantic match with Hogan scoring within the first minute before Danny Graham scored twice in quick succession to bring the match into Blackburn's favour. Hogan scored his second soon after to level the score but a deflection from Dean into his own net proved to be the winner as Blackburn won 3-2. Brentford's dismal November continued back at Griffin Park against Birmingham City. Despite dominating the game, Brentford fell to a 2-1 defeat after a penalty from former Bee Clayton Donaldson and a goal from Ryan Shotton midway through the second half. Blues' keeper Tomasz Kuszczak had a fine game with a string of good saves while Vibe had a shot blocked on the line. Hogan's header was merely a consolation goal as Brentford finished November with no points from 3 games.|$|R

As it only explores possibility with the biggest value, not explore per level like BFS or DFS and another blind search algorithm, also it’s no need much memory as BFS. Before using A* algorithm, the program would be eliminate the possible numbers with matrix elimination. Matrix elimination is a method to eliminate numbers in vertical, horizontal and sub grid. After using matrix elimination, A* is used heuristic function to get the biggest value to expand. The heuristic function that is used is Σsub grid + Σ horizontal + Σ vertical that has complete or open up. And then it will explore the biggest value with A* algorithm. In conclusion, Sudoku can be solved faster with combination of Matrix Elimination and A* Algorithm...|$|R
