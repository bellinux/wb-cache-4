ObjectivesOur primary objective was to compare bioavailability and tolerability of a generic <b>sustained-release</b> <b>tablet</b> with the established reference <b>sustained-release</b> <b>tablet</b> of diclofenac sodium in a fasting, healthy Chinese male population. MethodsA randomized, open-label, single- and multiple-dose study design was used. After the single dose, volunteers received diclofenac sodium <b>sustained-release</b> <b>tablet</b> once daily for 5 days. In the single-dose phase, blood samples were collected from 0 to 36 hours after drug administration. In the multiple-dose phase, samples were obtained before drug administration at 8 : 00 am on Days 3 and 4 to determine Cmin,ss of diclofenac sodium; on Day 5, samples were collected from 0 to 36 hours. Adverse events were monitored via subject interview, vital signs, and blood sampling. ResultsTwenty-four Chinese male volunteers were enrolled. The pharmacokinetic parameters (mean [SD]) for diclofenac after single dose of 75 and 100 mg were: Cmax 473. 5 [179. 5] and 546. 6 [154. 9] ng/mL; AUC 0 –∞ 3841. 2 [1402. 3], and 5019. 1 [2, 314. 0] ng·h/mL; Tmax 4. 9 [2. 4], and 4. 3 [2. 2] hours; t 1 / 2 5. 9 [2. 5], and 6. 0 [2. 2] hours. Mean [SD] values after multiple doses of 75 and 100 mg were: Cmax,ss 525. 6 [127. 4] and 650. 5 [167. 0] ng/mL, Cmin,ss 33. 9 [20. 9] and 62. 9 [34. 9] ng/mL, AUCss 4316. 3 [633. 0] and 5335. 1 [1291. 9] ng·h/mL, Cav,ss 179. 8 [26. 4] and 222. 3 [53. 8] ng/mL, Tmax 5. 1 [1. 8] and 4. 5 [0. 9] hours and t 1 / 2 5. 2 [2. 9] and 5. 5 [2. 8] hours, respectively.

In this study, matrix aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) tablets with ethylcellulose (EC), Eudragit RS 100 (RS), and Eudragit S 100 (S) were prepared by direct compression. The release behaviors were then studied in two counterpart series of tablets with hardness difference of three Kp units, and compared by non-linear regression analysis. The release pattern for both the S-containing and RS-containing formulations fitted best in Higuchi model, and the proper equations were suggested. In the EC-containing formulation, Higuchi and also zero-order models were probable models for the release, and a combination equation for the release was suggested. In the S-containing formulation, the release profile was completely sensitive to the hardness change.

Conventional imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) tablets produce rapid and relatively high peak blood levels and requires frequent administration to keep the plasma drug level at an effective range. This might cause side effects, reduced effectiveness and poor therapeutic management. Therefore, floating <b>sustained-release</b> Imatinib <b>tablets</b> were developed to allow the tablets to be released in {{the upper part of}} the GIT and overcome the inadequacy of conventional <b>tablets.</b> Floating <b>sustained-release</b> Imatinib mesylate <b>tablets</b> were prepared using the wet granulation method. Tablets were formulated using Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC K 4 M), with Sodium alginate (SA) and Carbomer 934 P (CP) as release-retarding polymers, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) as the effervescent agent and lactose as a filler. Floating behavior, in vitro drug release, and swelling index studies were conducted. Initial and total drug release duration was compared with a commercial tablet (Gleevec) in 0. 1 N HCl (pH 1. 2) at 37 ± 0. 5 °C for 24 hours. Tablets were then evaluated for various physical parameters, including weight variation, thickness, hardness, friability, and drug content. Consequently, 6 months of physical stability studies and in vitro gastro-retentive studies were conducted. Statistical data analysis revealed that tablets containing a composition of 14. 67 % w/w HPMC K 4 M, 10. 67 %, w/w Na alginate, 1. 33 %, w/w Carbomer 934 P and 9. 33 %, w/w NaHCO 3 produced the most favorable formulation to develop 24 -hour <b>sustained-release</b> <b>tablets</b> with optimum floating behavior and satisfactory physicochemical characteristics.

Tablets have been prepared by direct compression, i. e. dry mixing of drug and SA, followed by compression, which is the easiest way to manufacture an oral dosage form. Until now, their controlled-release properties have been assessed only by an in vitro dissolution test. Amylose-based polymers are normally subject to biodegradation by α-amylase enzymes present in the gastrointestinal tract, but matrix systems show no significant degradation of tablets by α-amylase in vitro. High-amylose sodium carboxymethyl starch (HASCA) is an interesting excipient for sustained drug-release in solid oral dosage forms.

Lag-time, release rate (k(0)), completeness of release, and zero-order correlation coefficient (R- 0 (2)) could be manipulated by varying ColoPulse (R) coating thickness. Our newly developed combination preparation (C[4. 92]) complied with all conducted European Pharmacopoeia tests as well as an accelerated 6 -month stability test and had a lag-time of 250 min (simulated ileum targeted), a linear release profile (mesalazine R- 0 (2) = 0. 9002; budesonide R- 0 (2) = 0. 9481), and drug release of 100 % mesalazine and 77 % budesonide. Like C[4. 92], MMX (R) -mesalazine had a linear (R- 0 (2) = 0. 9883) and complete release profile (96 %). However, C[4. 92] lag-time was longer (250 vs. 210 min), assuring simulated ileum specificity. Remarkably, MMX (R) -budesonide lag-time was 480 min and release was only 7 % with a linear character (R- 0 (2) = 0. 9906). The in vitro results suggest that MMX (R) -budesonide effectiveness may be improved if budesonide release in the aqueous phase would be increased and that C[4. 92] is a potential, new treatment option for ileo-colonic CD and UC.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} the potential of a dynamic, multicompartmental in vitro system simulating the human stomach and small intestine (TIM- 1) for studying the behavior of oral drug dosage forms under various physiological gastrointestinal conditions. Methods. Two model drug compounds were studied in TIM- 1 : a lyophilized Lactobacillus strain and paracetamol (acctaminophen). The Lactobacillus survival rate was determined by bacterial counting in the gastric and ileal effluents while simulating the conditions of the gastrointestinal tract of infants or adults. The availability for absorption of paracetamol from two oral dosage forms was investigated by measuring the drug concentration in jejunal dialysis fluid. The effect of gastrointestinal passage time and food intake on paracetamol absorption was also studied. Results. The Lactobacillus survival rate in both gastric and ileal effluents was higher during simulation of the infant compared to adult conditions. We also showed that (i) paracetamol absorption was faster when it was administered as a free powder than in <b>sustained-release</b> <b>tablet</b> form, (ii) a slow passage time resulted in a delay in the absorption of paracetamol, and (iii) there was a lower rate of absorption when paracetamol was ingested with a standard breakfast as opposed to water. The in vitro results were consistent with in vivo data, showing the predictive value of TIM- 1. Conclusions. TIM- 1 is a powerful tool for supplying valuable information about the effects of various gastrointestinal conditions on biopharmaceutical behavior and efficacy of drug delivery systems in the development of oral formulations.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop once-daily metformin hydrochloride <b>sustained-release</b> <b>tablets</b> (MHSRT) and evaluate their in vitro release behavior. MHSRT were prepared by the film coating method. The in vitro drug release rate of MHSRT and the commercial tablets Fortamet ® made in the United States of America in water was fitted with zero order kinetic equation, and Ritger-Peppas kinetic equation in 0. 1 M HCl and pH 6. 8 -phosphate buffer, respectively. The similarity factor f 2 values of MHSRT in three different dissolution medium were 82, 80 and 74, respectively in comparison with imported Fortamet®, which were all greater than 50. The results of storage-stability showed that MHSRT were stable for at least 6 months under stress condition (40 ˚C ± 2 ˚C, RH 75 % ± 5 %). Therefore, in this study, MHSRT were successfully prepared using optimized formulation technologies that meet mass produce. The in vitro release behavior of MHSRT was almost similar to that of imported Fortamet®...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{concentration}} of hydrophilic (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose [HPMC]) and hydrophobic (hydrogenated castor oil [HCO]) products, fillers (lactose and dibasic calcium phosphate), and buffers (sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, and sodium citrate) on naproxen release rate was studied. Matrix tablets were prepared by double compression, andIn vitro dissolution tests were performed. The dissolution results showed that an increased amount of HPMC or hydrogenated castor oil resulted in reduced drug release. The inclusion of buffers in the HPMC matrix tablets enhanced naproxen release. For HCO tablets, only sodium bicarbonate enhanced naproxen release. The presence of lactose on HPMC matrix tablets did not show a significantly different result from that obtained with the formulation containing dibasic calcium phosphate as a filler. However, for the tablets containing HCO, the presence of lactose significantly enhanced the naproxen release rate. The matrix-forming materials {{in this study were}} suitable for use in <b>sustained-release</b> <b>tablets</b> containing naproxen. The drug release can be modulated by adding suitable amounts of diluents and buffers...|$|R
50|$|In {{long-term}} use, therapeutic {{concentrations of}} lithium have been thought to cause histological and functional {{changes in the}} kidney. The significance of such changes is not clear, but is of sufficient concern to discourage long-term use of lithium unless it is definitely indicated. Doctors may change a bipolar patient's medication from lithium to another mood-stabilizing drug, such as valproate (Depakote), if problems with the kidneys arise. An important potential consequence of long-term lithium use {{is the development of}} renal diabetes insipidus (inability to concentrate urine). Patients should therefore be maintained on lithium treatment after three to five years only if, on assessment, benefit persists. Conventional and <b>sustained-release</b> <b>tablets</b> are available. Preparations vary widely in bioavailability, and a change in the formulation used requires the same precautions as initiation of treatment. There are few reasons to prefer any one simple salt of lithium; the carbonate has been the more widely used, but the citrate is also available.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the current}} work was to develop generic <b>sustained-release</b> <b>tablets</b> {{containing}} 35 [*]mg trimetazidine dihydrochloride and to establish an in vitro–in vivo correlation that could predict the bioavailability. The marketed sustained release tablet (Vastarel MR) used as reference, a <b>sustained-release</b> matrix <b>tablet</b> was prepared using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as matrix by wet granulation and the in vitro dissolution profiles of the self-made tablets were determined in four different dissolution media (0. 1 [*]M HCl, pH[*] 4. 5 PBS, pH[*] 6. 8 PBS and water). A higher similarity between prepared tablets and Vastarel MR was established, with similarity factor (f 2) ranging from 60 to 75 in the four media. The in vivo pharmacokinetics was studied in six healthy beagles. Compared with Vastarel MR, the Cmax of self-made tablets was slightly decreased, while the Tmax and MRT 0 –t were slightly prolonged, but with no significant difference (P[*]>[*] 0. 05). The average of relative bioavailability (F) was 102. 52 % based on AUC 0 –t. For log-transformed AUC 0 –t and Cmax, the upper confidence limit on the appropriate criterion is < 0, indicating these two formulations were population bioequivalent. The in vivo–in vitro correlation coefficient obtained from point-to-point analysis of self-made tablets was 0. 9720. In conclusion, the prepared tablets were bioequivalent to the marketed tablets, according to both the in vitro release rate and extent of absorption, and a good in vivo–in vitro correlation was established for the self-made tablets that indicated in vitro dissolution tests {{could be used as}} a surrogate for bioavailability studies...|$|R
40|$|Morphine is the {{dominant}} medication to control cancer pain. Morphine consumption has been increasing each year in many countries including Japan based on {{the understanding of the}} WHO report on the treatment of cancer pain. To evaluate the recent and current state of palliative medication for cancer patients in Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University (TMPU) Hospital, the amount of and trend in the use of morphine preparations from 1992 to 2001 were investigated. The amount used increased every year to 3. 9 -fold of that in 1992 {{at the end of this}} survey. Inpurticalar, the consumption of morphine sulfate <b>sustained-release</b> <b>tablets</b> and morphine hydrochloride injection increased markedly, because both total dose in individual patients and the number of patients treated with high-dose morphine increased, The distribution of the maximum daily dose in TMPU Hospital was similar to that in a specialist hospital in oncology. In conclusion, morphine consumption will increase to achieve better palliative care and to improve quality of life in cancel patients, and therefore appropriate use and regulation of narcotic preparations are necessary...|$|R
40|$|PARTICIPANTS: Of the 309 pharmacies, 76. 1 percent (235) {{completed}} the survey. MEASUREMENTS AND MATNRESULTS: Apprehensionwas significantly elevated for methadone, hydromorphone,and for morphine doses> 500 mg/d (p<O. OOI). The most common reasons listed for apprehensionwere forgery (46. 4 percent), theft (40. 4 percent), high dosages (23. 8 percent),narcotic investigations(18. 7 percent), and patientaddiction(9. 4 percent). Hydromorphone was available (in stock) in 80. 5 {{percent of the}} pharmacies, followed by morphine 30 -mg <b>sustained-release</b> <b>tablets</b> (64. 5 percent) and methadone (53. 4 percent). The vast majority of pharmacists were willing to order strong narcotics for specificpatients.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in measuring pharmacokinetic parameters of phenylpropanolamine (PPA), a sympathomimetic amine used in over-the-counter nasal decongestants and anorectic formulations. A high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure {{was developed to}} enable direct ultraviolet detection of PPA, after extraction from serum and urine, without prior derivatization of the drug. This method was used to assay samples obtained from a bioavailability study of BUBtained-releasePPA tablets. The mean serum and urine profiles obtained are presented. The <b>sustained-release</b> <b>tablets</b> were subjected to dissolution testing utilizing the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP XIX) rotating basket method. An internal standard was incorporated into the dissolution fluid to enable direct analysis of the samples by HPLC. A comparison of three different dissolution fluid regimens was carried out to determine if release of the drug was affected by the change in pH of the medium and to select the most convenient method for the final dissolution studies. Some preliminary observations relating to correlations between rate of drug release from the sustained-release dosage form and percent drug absorbed are presented...|$|R
