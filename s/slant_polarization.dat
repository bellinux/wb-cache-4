40|$|Abstract—A 45 slant-polarized {{omnidirectional}} antenna is proposed for mobile communication base stations. The proposed antenna {{consists of four}} printed crossed-dipole elements which are rolled up into a cylinder for omnidirectional radiation. Each crossed-dipole element is composed of a horizontal dipole and a vertical dipole. The 45 <b>slant</b> <b>polarization</b> is achieved by adjusting the lengths of the horizontal and vertical dipoles. A broadband feeding network consisting of four broadband baluns and an impedance matching circuit is introduced to feed the four crossed-dipole elements. Experimental {{results show that the}} omnidirectionality or gain variation in the horizontal plane is less than 1 dB while the cross-polarization level is below dB over a bandwidth of 15 % (1. 9 – 2. 2 GHz). The 45 slant-polarized {{omnidirectional antenna}} has a bandwidth of 22 % (1. 75 – 2. 18 GHz) for 15 -dB return loss. Theoretical analysis and design procedure are presented.

Electro-optic modulators using polarization reversal have remarkable features of spatial modulation suitable especially for microwave modula-tion. This paper reviews electro-optic devices with polarization reversal. An electro-optic modulator with periodic polarization reversal is an efficient phase modulator in microwave frequency regions with quasi-velocity-matching, which is useful not only in modulators but also spectral comb generators and coherence controllers.

Ray-tracing tool is used to study effects of electric field polarization on the received power in outdoor environments. The performance of diversity schemes with vertical / horizontal polarization and + 45 ◦/− 45 ◦ <b>slanted</b> <b>polarization</b> are compared in different line-of-sight (LOS) and nonline-of-sight (NLOS) environments. Based on the evaluation of cross polarization discrimination (XPD) parameters, it is clarified that different environments will affect XPD values in micro cells.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{analysis}} of the cross-correlation coefficient between signals at two antenna branches (ports) in the presence of spatially selective interference and additive white gaussian noise. More specifically, we look at a ± 45 ◦ <b>slanted</b> <b>polarization</b> diversity arrangement, which is rotated around the axis perpendicular to the plane containing the antennas. Results are provided {{as a function of the}} rotation angle. The analysis is based on the spherical vector wave multi-pole expansion of both the field impinging on the antennas and the antenna radiation properties. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} experimentally the relationships between cross-polarization discrimination (XPD), signal cross correlation, and polarization diversity gain with horizontally/vertically (HV) polarized reception at the base-station (BS) end at 1800 MHz. The performance of the horizontal/vertical polarization diversity scheme was also compared with a diversity scheme with 645 <b>slanted</b> <b>polarizations</b> and horizontal space diversity at 1800 MHz in a personal communication system (PCS) mobile network. A measurement campaign was conducted in small/micro cells in different types of areas, taking into account the influence of mobile antenna inclination. According to the measurements, XPD values for horizontal/vertical polarizations vary between 5 – 15 dB, depending on the environment. Furthermore, XPD values depend highly on the radio propagation path between the BS and mobile station (MS) due to line-of-sight (LOS) and nonline-of-sight (NLOS) situations. Signal cross correlations of horizontal and vertical polarizations in both LOS and NLOS situations were clearly below 0. 7, which is the generally accepted value to have a reasonable improvement at the receiving end with diversity. Finally, the results showed that almost equal diversity gain and system performance in a PCS network at 1800 MHz can be achieved in small/micro cells in different environments with 645 <b>slanted</b> <b>polarizations</b> at the BS end when comparing results with horizontal space diversity. The performance of horizontal/vertical polarization diversity scheme was approximately 1 dB worse than horizontal space diversity.

40|$|Design of {{antenna array}} under the {{limitation}} of restricted size is a challenging problem. Cavity-backed slot antenna is widely used because of its advantages of small size, wide band, and wide beam. In this paper, a design of wide band and wide beam cavity-backed slot antenna array with the <b>slant</b> <b>polarization</b> is proposed. To obtain wide band and wide beam with limited size, the inverted microstrip-fed cavity-backed slot antenna (IMF-CBSA) is adopted as the element of 1 × 4 antenna array. The slant polarized antennas and their feeding networks are adopted because of their simple structures. The performance of the proposed antenna array is verified by the simulations and experiments. The measured VSWR < 2 bandwidth is 55 % at the center frequency 21. 8 [*]GHz, and the gain is larger than 12. 2 [*]dB.

40|$|The rising {{popularity}} of wireless communication systems has induced {{a demand for}} more and more efficient systems, able to serve larger numbers of users, to provide higher transmission speeds and to operate in more complex environments. The present limited available bandwidth and the growing request for capacity require new channels to be multiplexed. This objective can be accomplished by employing smart antenna systems at the base station. A smart antenna can be used to direct the main beam toward the desired user and to set pattern s in the direction of interferers. Such a system can be seen as channel multiplexing in the spatial domain, which increases both carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I) and system capacity. Moreover, {{it is important to note}} that dual-polarization sensors provide a diversity scheme. In this framework, plusmn; 45 deg; <b>slanted</b> <b>polarizations</b> are preferred to vertical/horizontal (V/H) polarizations because they form identical azimuthal patterns and are equally sensible to horizontally and vertically polarized signals. A dual-polarized microstrip array panel is proposed, which can be used as a smart antenna in the framework of Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems (UMTS) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of strain in quantum-wells leads to polarization dependence in their ab-sorption characteristics. Material containing compressively strained quantum-well layers (such {{as used in}} the POLarization based Integration Scheme, POLIS) shows enhanced in-teraction with the TE polarization. Devices fabricated on such material {{are affected by the}} polarization dependence as well. For <b>slanted</b> side-wall <b>polarization</b> converters this leads to different effective conversion lengths for the TE and TM polarization. Simula-tions show that the polarization dependent absorption affecting these devices is saturable and therefore power dependent. The simulations have been confirmed by measurements on experimental devices. Quantum well <b>polarization</b> converters <b>Slanted</b> sidewall <b>polarization</b> converters operate on the principle that the light, applied at the input, is forced into two hybrid polarization states [1]. These hybrid states are linear combinations of the main polarization states TE and TM.

40|$|The {{importance}} of polarization manipulation is increased as optical fiber systems evolve to higher data rates. Photonic integrated circuits should be {{insensitive to the}} state of polarization of the light emanating from fibers {{if they are to be}} used as detectors, add-drop mutiplexers or cross connects. Either all the integrated components have to be polarization independent or only one polarization direction should be used. For either method, a compact polarization converter is useful. A model is developed for the mode propagation in the waveguide of the <b>slanted</b> side <b>polarization</b> converter based on double hetero structures. The model is extended to include polarization dependent absorption and mismatch. Polarization converters on different double heterostructures (with and without quantum wells) have been designed and are realized by contact optical lithography.

40|$|Investigation of endfire {{slotline}} antennas, such as notch or Vivaldi antennas, {{has been}} progressing {{over the last}} few decades. The physics of these antennas is as yet not well understood. Simple models do not predict their behavior accurately, and experimental data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, therefore full wave computer simulations, (finite element and moment method) are used extensively to model their behavior. ^ Dual-polarized arrays of these elements is the main topic of this work. A moment method analysis is developed to analyze these arrays. Many previously unknown results pertaining to their radiation and polarization characteristics are presented. With two orthogonally polarized elements, virtually any arbitrary polarization of wave can be transmitted provided (1) amplitude and phase control is used and (2) neither antenna is blind at the operating frequency and scan angle. Also, an unexpected asymmetry of the radiation was discovered and traced to the stripline feed. ^ Amplitude and phase control can be expensive to implement and may reduce the efficiency of the amplifiers, however. As an alternative, the use of phase-only control is investigated. This works well for generating a reduced set of antenna polarizations, namely, the left and right hand circular polarization, ± 45 ∘ <b>slant</b> linear <b>polarization.</b> Horizontal and vertical polarization can be generated as well if the amplifiers are switched on and off. ^ A new class of resonance was discovered for the dual-polarized array. The physical mechanism is identified and studies are performed showing the variation of resonant frequency with antenna shape, dielectric constant of the substrate and array depth. ^ A new class of single-polarized arrays is also studied. Full and partial crosswalls are shown to alter the E-plane patterns in a variety of useful ways. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper has}} the {{intention}} of reflecting on the subtleties of the discourse of the educators, assistants and the children, which happens in the early childhood daily routine, upon the <b>polarization</b> <b>slant.</b> What I call polarization {{has to do with}} the dualities of the discourse of the educators and children about their knowings and doings, such as right and wrong, speak and shut up, learn and play, start and end, beautiful and ugly, good and bad, viz, the existence of two poles for the discourse: a positive one and a negative one. In this text we support the idea that, in early childhood education, the educators, assistants and the children should pay more attention to their discourse, so that they could break with the polarization, avoiding undesirable results. Together, they may start to talk about the present moment as something of the now, and not as something that has a dual value. Besides, we believe that it is relevant that since the beginning of the schooldays of the children there be no polarization of the discourse by the adults that accompany them.
