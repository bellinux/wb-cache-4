40|$|International audienceNew {{generation}} of radiation therapy accelerators requires highly accurate dose measurements with high spatial resolution patterns. IMRT is especially demanding since the positioning accuracy {{of all the}} multi-leafs should be verified for each applied field and at any incidence. A new 2 -D tissue equivalent dosemeter is presented with high spatial resolution that can fulfil these tasks. A plastic scintillator sheet is sandwiched between two polystyrene cubes, and the emitted light is observed by a high-resolution camera. A patented procedure allows efficient discrimination of the scintillation proportional to the dose from the parasitic Cerenkov radiation. This extraction made on the cumulated images taken during an irradiation field {{at a rate of}} 10 images s(- 1) provides high-resolution mapping of the dose rate and cumulated dose in quasi real time. The dosemeter is tissue equivalent (ICRU- 44) and works both for electrons and photons without complex parameter adjustment, since phantom and detector materials are identical. The calibration is simple and independent of the irradiation conditions (energy, fluence, quality and so on). The principle of the dosemeter and its calibration procedure are discussed in this paper. The results and, in particular, the dose depth profiles are compared with <b>standard</b> <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> measurements in polystyrene for both photons and electrons.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} combined air scatter and air absorption correction necessary to apply to measurements of the air kerma rate made at a distance of 1 metre from a " 1 " 9 " 2 Ir source free in air. This correction needs to be determined as the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) intends to set up a calibration service whereby secondary <b>standard</b> <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> can be calibrated against a primary standard in terms of air kerma rate at 1 metre in free space from a " 1 " 9 " 2 Ir source. Measurements were made with 2 types of chamber. Firstly measurements were made with a 100 cm" 3 spherical graphite transfer chamber and then measurements were repeated using a 1. 79 cm" 3 cylindrical cavity chamber which is one of a set of 3 chambers which form the primary standard for " 6 " 0 Co and " 1 " 3 " 7 Cs maintained by the NPL. As both these chambers were originally intended for use with photons of higher energies the graphite caps of the chambers provide a sufficient build up region to develop charged particle equilibrium. The " 1 " 9 " 2 Ir source used is a pellet encapsulated in a stainless steel casing, with diameter 1. 1 mm and length 5 mm. The source was exposed using a High Dose Rate (HDR) microSelectron brachytherapy unit manufactured by Nucletron. Results from measurements made using the transfer chamber gave an air attenuation correction to be applied to the measured charge at a source to chamber distance of 1 metre of (1. 2 #+-# 0. 3) %. Measurements made using the cylindrical cavity chamber could not be used to determine an estimate of the air attenuation correction for this set up.

Using the secondary activity standard for 18 F, the Capintec CRC- 712 M dose calibrator at the Australian National Medical Cyclotron (NMC) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Quality Control (QC) Section was calibrated. The dial setting number recommended by the manufacturer for the measurement of the activity of 18 F is 439.

40|$|During orthovoltage x-ray {{radiotherapy}} dosimetry, {{normal practice}} requires {{the use of}} a <b>standard</b> <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> and dedicated electrometer for dosimetry. In ideal conditions, the electrometer is positioned outside the treatment room to eliminate any effects from scatter radiation on dose measurement. However in some older designed rooms, there is no access portal for the chamber cable to run to an “outside” position for the electrometer. As such the electrometer is positioned within the treatment room. This work quantifies the effects on measured charge when this occurs. Results have shown that with the electrometer positioned next to a solid water dosimetry stack and using a large 15 × 15 cm field at 250 kVp x-ray beam energy, charge results can deviate by up to ± 17. 2 % depending on the polarity applied to the chamber compared to readings when the electrometer is outside the treatment room. It is assumed to be due to scatter radiation producing electrons in the amplifying circuit of the electrometer. Results are also shown when the electrometer is shielded by a 4 mm thick lead casing whilst inside the room which removes the scattering effect, providing the best case scenario when the electrometer must remain in the treatment room. Whilst {{it is well known that}} an electrometer should not be irradiated (even to scattered radiation), often small kilovoltage or orthovoltage rooms do not have a portal access for an electrometer to go outside. As such it would be recommended for a lead shield to be placed around the electrometer during irradiation if this was to occur to minimize dosimetric inaccuracies which may occur due to scattered radiation effects...|$|E

The study presented here is a continuation of previous work with the final aim to obtain validated computer models of the Mg-Ar and TE-TE <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers.</b> With these two chambers the so-called paired <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> technique is performed by which the neutron and gamma dose components can be separated and determined. By knowing exactly the neutron and gamma source in a simulation, the chamber response can be investigated. However, the validation of a simulated <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> set-up, starting directly with the mixed neutron/gamma fields is too complicated regarding the number of possibilities that could cause a discrepancy between measurements and simulations.

40|$|Background: Recent {{protocols}} for {{the determination}} of absorbed dose to water in high-energy photon and electron beams are based on air <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> calibrated in terms of absorbed dose to water in a 60 Co gamma ray beam (60, Co D w). To determine the absorbed dose to water in any other high-energy beam (excluding neutrons), the protocols use chamber dependent beam quality conversion factors. Such factors are published in different protocols {{but only for a}} selected number of <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> used clinically. These beam quality correction factors can alternatively be determined experimentally in the user’s beam qualities for each <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> The measurement of beam quality correction factors (kQ for photons and kq,E for electrons) accounts for the actual design of different <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers.</b> Direct measurement in the user’s beams also helps to minimise the uncertainties inherent in the theoretical determination of beam quality correction factors based on a unified design. Purpose: The purpose of this work was to determine values of the beam quality correction factors in clinical high-energy photon and electron beams for PTW 30013 and PTW 23333 0. 6 cm 3 <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers,</b> a PTW 31006 ‘Pinpoint’ <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber,</b> a PTW 31010 0. 125 cm 3 <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber,</b> a PTW 23343 Markus and a PTW 34045 Advanced Markus <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> Methods and materials: Siemens Primus linear accelerators were used to generate 6 and 18 MV photon beams and 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 18 and 21 MeV electron beams. An Equinox Theratron External Beam Therapy System was used to generate the 60 Co beam used in this study. The <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> were all cross-calibrated for 60, Co D w against the PTW 23333 0. 6 cm 3 reference <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> at 5 cm water-equivalent depth in the 60 Co beam. The field size at the reference depth was 10 cm x 10 cm. For the same set-up, the absorbed dose to water using the IAEA TRS- 398 (IAEA, 2000) was determined using the PTW 23333 0. 6 cm 3 reference <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> The exposure calibration factor (x) for the PTW 23333 0. 6 cm 3 reference chamber was then derived by equating the absorbed dose to water calculated from the IAEA TRS- 398 protocol to the absorbed dose to water calculated from the AAPM TG- 21 (AAPM, 1983) protocol. The cavity-gas calibration factor (gas) was then determined for the PTW 23333 0. 6 cm 3 reference <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> The cross-calibrated 60, Co D w for each cylindrical chamber and the absorbed dose to water due to the PTW 23333 0. 6 cm 3 reference <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> in the 6 MV and 18 MV photon beams were used to determine kQ for each <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> at the respective photon energies.

It is believed that the sometimes confusing and incomprehensible outcomes in BNCT research are due to incorrect dosimetry, i. e. misleading measurements. A popular detector {{used to describe the}} absorbed neutron and gamma doses is the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> To understand better the behaviour and intricacies of this detector, the collected and measured current is directly simulated with MCNPX. This Monte Carlo code is able to track neutrons, gammas and electrons all around and in the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> The calculated dose deposited by the electrons in the gas is proportional to the current measured. Protons and alphas emanating from the wall and/or gas materials due to nuclear reactions can also cause ionisations and thus add to the current. A custom-made program has been written to simulate this contribution. The issue in this study is that a disagreement between simulated and measured current can be caused by the computer code and/or measurement set-up and/or unknown influences of source and/or materials. Therefore, the model of the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> as well as the neutron and gamma source descriptions are validated step-by-step. After having obtained enough confidence in the model it can be concluded that <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> measurements can be significantly affected by neutron interactions (this is energy dependent). Neutrons can increase the measured current due to unknown and unconsidered beta-, proton- and/or alpha-producers in the wall material and gas; this dose component does not exist without the presence of the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber.</b> JRC.

This instrument was, for the first time, used to characterize the radiation field, in terms of air kerma, produced by a Cs- 137 source in an irradiator Shepherd model 81, used mainly for radiation protection calibration purposes. Monte Carlo simulation studies were also made, using MCNP 5.

40|$|The fi rst part of {{this study}} was about {{measurement}} of dosimetric parameters for small photon beams to be used as input data for treatment planning computer system (TPS) and to verify the dose calculated by TPS in Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) procedure. The beam data required were percentage depth dose (PDD), off-axis ratio (OAR) and scattering factor. Small beams of 5 mm to 45 mm diameter from a circular cone collimator in SRS were used for beam data measurements. Measurements were made using pinpoint <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> (0. 016 cc). In the second {{part of this}} study, we reported the important of carrying out quality assurance (QA) procedures before SRS treatment which were found to infl uence the accuracy of dose delivery. These QA procedures consisted of measurements on the accuracy in target localization and treatment room laser alignment. The calculated TPS dose for treatment was verifi ed using pinpoint <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> and thermoluminescent detector (TLD) 100 H. The deviation mean between measured and calculated dose was- 3. 28 %. The measured dose obtained from pinpoint <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> is in good agreement with the calculated dose from TPS with deviation mean of 2. 17 %. In conclusion, pinpoint <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> gives a better accuracy in dose calculation compared to TLD 100 H. The results are acceptable as recommended by International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) Report No. 50 (1994) that dose delivered to the target volume must be within ± 5 % error...|$|R

40|$|To {{facilitate}} a national improvement in therapeutic dosimetry, ARPANSA has installed a clinical linear accelerator (linac) to provide chamber calibrations at the user beam quality. The ARPANSA reference linac is an Elekta Synergy platform linac, {{which can be}} tuned to mimic the beam qualities available in Australian clinics, such as those produced by the Varian linac platforms. Monte Carlo models of a Varian and matched Elekta accelerator have been developed and commissioned. They accurately predict the measured percentage depth dose and profiles, but show significantly different energy spectra, resulting mainly from differences in target thickness between the two accelerators. The critical question is if the spectral difference between the Varian and the matched Elekta will cause any significant change in a chamber calibration factor. This work calculates the error introduced when using a calibration factor obtained from this Elekta Synergy Platform linac on a Varian high energy platform beam at 6 MV. To determine the answer a two stage modelling approach was applied. Firstly the graphite calorimeter that is the Australian primary standard of absorbed dose was modelled. Using the commissioned linac models, the calorimetry measurements of absorbed dose to graphite {{can be converted to}} absorbed dose to water in a direct Monte Carlo conversion. Using the direct MC conversion removes from the calorimeter response any dependence on the source spectrum. The <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> calibration factor is then only dependant on the chamber response. The direct MC conversion without a transfer chamber in graphite is also a novel method of realising absorbed dose to water from graphite calorimetry measurements. The second stage was to model a secondary standard chamber type NE 2561. The modelling of the energy correction factor kQ of a secondary standard NE 2561 chamber shows a difference of 0. 4 % between the Varian and Varian-matched Elekta beams. Although small, this is a significant discrepancy for primary <b>standard</b> calibrations. <b>Ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> calibrated on the ARPANSA 6 MV beam may be in error by 0. 4 % when used on a Varian 6 MV beam. Similar variations may occur with other manufacturers. The work has also investigated the design of a custom flattening filter to precisely match the energy spectrum of the Varian beam on the Elekta platform. The Monte-Carlo investigation of the kQ of the secondary standard NE 2561 chamber was extended to consider the response with the new flattening filter free (FFF) modality. The kQ from a modelled Varian FFF beam showed a difference of 0. 8 % compared to the 6 MV Elekta with the same beam quality index, TPR 20, 10, (Tissue phantom ratio in water at depths of 20 and 10 cm), and the Elekta FFF beam showed a difference of 0. 6 %. The magnitude of the discrepancy between the Varian FFF beam and the ARPANSA Elekta beam demonstates that TPR 20, 10 is not sufficient as the sole beam quality specifier to derive calibration factors for flattening filter free beams, and even with standard clinical beams the use of TPR 20, 10 alone can introduce errors of 0. 4 %...|$|R

30|$|MS is a {{detection}} technique {{based on the}} measurement of the mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio of ionised analyte molecules. The obtained m/z ratio from an analytes can then be identified by correlating the mass {{with that of a}} specific molecule and/or by identifying characteristic fragmentation patterns that may occur during ionisation (de Hoffman & Stroobant 2007). In order to ionise the analytes in a solution there is need to transfer the molecules in to gas phase. One of the most widely used ionisation techniques is electrospray ionisation (ESI), which applies a high voltage to the mobile phase to create an aerosol within the <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> (de Hoffman & Stroobant 2007).

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of ambient doses at work places around high-energy accelerators is a challenging task due {{the complexity of}} the mixed stray radiation fields encountered. At CERN, mainly Centronics IG 5 high-pressure <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> are used to monitor radiation exposure in mixed fields. The monitors are calibrated in the operational quantity ambient dose equivalent H*(10) using standard, source-generated photon- and neutron fields. However, the relationship between <b>ionisation</b> <b>chamber</b> reading and ambient dose equivalent in a mixed high-energy radiation field can only be assessed if the spectral response to every component and the field composition is known. Therefore, comprehensive studies were performed at the CERN-EU high-energy reference field facility where the spectral fluence for each particle type has been assessed with Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, studies have been performed in an accessible controlled radiation area in the vicinity of a beam loss point of CERN's proton synchrotron. The comparison of measurements and calculations has shown reasonable agreement for most exposure conditions. The results indicate that conventionally calibrated <b>ionisation</b> <b>chambers</b> can give satisfactory response in terms of ambient dose equivalent in stray radiation fields at high-energy accelerators in many cases. These studies are one step towards establishing a method of ‘field calibration' of radiation protection instruments in which Monte Carlo simulations will be used to establish a correct correlation between the response of specific detectors to a given high-energy radiation fiel...|$|R
