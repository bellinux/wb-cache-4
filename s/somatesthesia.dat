40|$|Abstract- The present paper {{investigates the}} motion depen-dence of human {{impedance}} perception ability, {{especially in the}} stiffness perception through experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the desirable hand displacement changes according to the robot stiffness, and that the deep somatic sensation has {{an important role in}} the stiffness perception. A preliminary training test is conducted for directing to apply the experimental findings into the development of an effective impedance perception training system based on cognitive therapeutic exercise.

40|$|The study {{attempted}} to explore that the synergistic effect of acupoints combination {{is not a}} simple superposition of single acupointâ€™s effect by comparing and analyzing the changes of blood pressure (BP), SF- 36, and brain regions after acupuncture treatment. 47 patients were randomly divided into LR 3 +KI 3 group, LR 3 group, and KI 3 group. Subjects received Rs-fMRI scan, BP measurement, and SF- 36 questionnaires before and after treatment and short-term acupuncture treatment. After treatment, {{there were no significant differences}} in BP and SF- 36 among 3 groups, compared to the case before treatment, SBP of 3 groups decreased, and DBP significantly decreased while vitality and mental health significantly increased in LR 3 +KI 3 group. Both number and scopes of changes of brain regions in LR 3 +KI 3 group were the largest, which mainly included BAs 3, 4, 8, 19, 21, 24, 32, 44, and 45. In conclusion, acupuncture at LR 3 +KI 3 may auxiliarily reduce BP and improve the vitality and mental health of patients, and the changes of brain regions were related to <b>somatesthesia,</b> movement, vision, audition, emotion and mood, language, memory, etc. BAs 4, 9, 10, 24, 31, 32, and 46 may be the targeting brain areas of acupuncture in assisting hypotension. It is suggested that acupoints combination of LR 3 +KI 3 maybe generates a synergistic effect, and it is not simple sum of single acupoint effect...|$|E
