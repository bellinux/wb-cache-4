30|$|For salpingoscopy, a 2.8 -mm rigid <b>salpingoscope</b> {{that allows}} a {{detailed}} vision of the tubal ampullary mucosa is used. The <b>salpingoscope</b> is introduced into the abdominal cavity through the operating channel of the laparoscope. The abdominal ostium of the tube is identified and cannulated, and the tubal mucosa is evaluated. At the ampullary level four or five major folds are noted, with minor folds interspersed between them.|$|E
30|$|Transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy was {{introduced}} in order to eliminate the risks of general anaesthetic at laparoscopy while maintaining a high diagnostic yield [6]. The procedure is done on an outpatient basis under local anaesthetic. A small diameter (2.7 – 2.9  mm) endoscope is inserted through the posterior vaginal fornix into the pouch of Douglas, using a blunt dilating trocar. Saline or ringer lactate infusion distends the peritoneal cavity. A panoramic view of the lower pelvis is obtained along with a more physiological view of the tubo-ovarian relationship. Diluted methylene blue dye can be injected transcervically and the fimbria visualised to demonstrate tubal patency. The transvaginal laparoscope can also be directed through the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube {{to act as a}} <b>salpingoscope.</b> The inability to perform surgery during transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy has been overcome by use of larger-diameter trocars with operative channels; however, only minimal adhesiolysis or a biopsy can be performed. Inability to visualise the anterior pelvis or the upper abdomen are other disadvantages.|$|E
40|$|By {{conducting}} the salpingoscopic examinations of 47 patients suffering from {{diseases of the}} ear, the author investigated adenoids in Rosenmuller's fossa (R. fossa), various adhesions, and behaviors of Torus tubaris {{at the time of}} swallowing; and obtained the following results. In most of chidren adenoids at the angle observable with the <b>salpingoscope</b> appeared to cover up the entire length of Torus tubaris and in youngsters up to the age of 17 years adenoids appeared to cover up a portion of Torus tubaris or to be touching it. In adults over 18 years old as well as in old persons string-like, band-like, and sheet-like adhesions were observed mainly in the upper commissure, running parallel to Torus tubaris and bridging either at the posterior upper part or the posterior lower part. From these salpingoscopic examinations carried on the patients with aural diseases it has been clarified that adenoids in children and various adhesions in adults interfere with the backward and upward movements of Torus tubaris thus causing tubal stenosis...|$|E
