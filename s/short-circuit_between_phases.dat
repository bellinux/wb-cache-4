40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} experimental robustness {{tests of}} Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFET submitted to current limitation or short-circuit operations. MOSFETs from different manufacturers {{have been tested}} and show different failure modes. A gate leakage current is detected before failure but is not necessarily responsible for the failure. For some tested devices, the failure appears in an open state mode after physical <b>short-circuit</b> <b>between</b> gate and source. The main failure mode is nevertheless a physical <b>short-circuit</b> <b>between</b> drain and source. However, the various tests show, despite the gate leakage current, excellent robustness of the various tested SiC MOSFET under short-circuit...|$|R

In this configuration, the internal battery has its negative terminal wired to the sleeve contact of the jack.

50|$|Due to oxidation, {{the copper}} {{cladding}} darkens {{with age and}} MICC is therefore often used in historic buildings such as castles where it blends in with stonework. However, where MICC cables with a bare copper sheath are installed in damp locations, particularly where lime mortar has been used, the water and lime combine to create an electrolytic action with the bare copper. Similarly, electrolytic action may also be caused by installing bare-sheath MICC cables on new oak. The reaction causes the copper to be eaten away, making {{a hole in the}} side of the cable and letting in water, causing a <b>short-circuit</b> <b>between</b> live, neutral and earth. The appearance of green verdigris on the bare copper sheath may be a sign this has occurred.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} critical reliability {{issues and}} their countermeasures for vertically structured poly-Si gate n-channel power MOSFETs (DMOS) on 4 H-SiC when operated at an elevated temperature {{of more than}} 300 ˚C {{for a long period}} of time. Two destructive failures were identified in a storage life test at 500 ˚C: a <b>short-circuit</b> <b>between</b> the source and the gate and a disconnection at the n+ source contact. The former was caused by interlayer dielectric erosion and/or Al spearing into the poly-Si gate; the latter was caused by the disappearance of the NiSix contact layer. Effective and practical countermeasures were devised and implemented. Device lifetime against the three different failure mechanisms was improved in every case by at least one order of magnitude...|$|R

[...] Furthermore it allows the DC voltage to be of either polarity (like a LCC HVDC scheme), giving rise to the possibility of hybrid LCC and VSC HVDC systems.
