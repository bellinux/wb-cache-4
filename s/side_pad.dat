5000|$|The 3DDX dance {{machine is}} {{composed}} by a two <b>side</b> <b>pad</b> {{connected to the}} computer hardware and a screen above the main cabinet. Each side of the dance pad has 4 buttons on {{the corners of the}} pad and 4 sensors, located to the left, right, front, and back sides of each pad. In contrast with other dancing rhythm games for arcade such as Dance Dance Revolution and Pump It Up, the 3DDX arcade doesn't have support bars to allow more movement in freestyle dancing. On the screen of the machine, arrows corresponding to each one of the buttons and sensors scroll upwards on the background until they reach a stationary set of arrows (often called [...] "receptors") on top of the screen, which indicate the moment when the player must step on the corresponding arrow and/or activate the corresponding sensor.|$|E

50|$|The helmet fitting process starts by {{measuring}} the player's head with calipers. Based on measurements taken, a helmet shell of the appropriate size and style is chosen. Then, padding is added {{to ensure that the}} helmet fits the player's head. Padding consists of both foam rubber pads and inflatable (air) pads. Both the top and <b>side</b> <b>padding</b> include inflatable bladders that customize the fit. Once the helmet is in place on the player's head, the inflater bulb is applied to two points {{on the outside of the}} helmet. The jaw pads are fitted to ensure that the lower part of the helmet is snug against the player's face. The helmets that most NFL teams use are remarkably light, and once the pads are in place, there is no movement or shifting on the player's head.|$|R

25|$|The {{early years}} of the CFL saw corrupt and reform {{elements}} battle for control. The CFL's constitution required an election for the presidency every six months, which encouraged instability, and a new president was elected roughly every year in the organization's first decade. Elections were also rife with fraud and violence. In January 1903, Madden arranged to have the names of all the reform candidates placed low on the ballot, many names were misspelled to deny the candidate election, and some names omitted altogether. Unions on both <b>sides</b> <b>padded</b> their membership lists in order to have more delegates to the convention. At least seven major brawls broke out on the convention floor, and one man was injured so badly he had to be rushed to the hospital. Only police intervention brought order. The July 1904 election saw such widespread violence (including fistfights in front of the ballot boxes). Three brawlers had to be carried home.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{demand for}} highly {{efficient}} photovoltaic modules at low costs leads to new solar cell designs. For enhanced module efficiency the cell efficiency {{has to be}} optimized regarding later operation under module conditions. This implies that the interconnected solar cell structure has to be assessed. Commonly the solar cell itself is optimized separately. In this work an easy to implement cell design was investigated where the number of busbars was varied to decrease the total series resistance of the interconnected solar cell. For this study a simulation program based on the two-diode model was applied to determine the optimal efficiency of the device. Furthermore, the simulations revealed that a device with multiple busbars has a high potential in cost savings due {{to a reduction in}} metal consumption for the front side metallization. For an optimized cell structure the amount of Ag paste needed for a sufficient front side metallization could be reduced to 7 mg Ag paste for a 6 inch solar cell. In the same time the efficiency can be increased. A detailed simulation of a screen printed and stringed rear side of a multi-busbar solar cell revealed the amount of rear <b>side</b> <b>pads</b> necessary for a sufficient interconnection leading to low series resistances...|$|R

40|$|Samples of {{the three}} {{cushioning}} foams used in the H 1259 weapon storage container were obtained in 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001 and tested for density, compression set and compressive strength using the same procedures specified for acceptance testing. Foams from six containers, all about 30 years old and located at Pantex, were evaluated. The bottom cushioning foam is a General Plastics polyurethane foam and the two <b>side</b> <b>pads</b> are rebonded polyurethane foams. All the tests were carried out at room temperature. When compared to the original acceptance requirements the foams were generally in-spec for density and compressive strength at 10 % strain and were generally out-of-spec for compression set and compressive strength at 50 % strain. Significant variability was noted {{in the performance of}} each foam sample and even more in the container-to-container foam performance. The container-to-container variability remains the major unknown in predicting the long-term suitability of these containers for continued use. The performance of the critical bottom cushion foams was generally more uniform and closer to the specified performance than that of the rebonded foams. It was judged that all the foams were adequate for continued use as storage container foams (not shipping) under controlled conditions to mitigate temperature extremes or high impact. This archived information is important in evaluations of the continued suitability for weapon storage use of the H 1259 containers and other containers using the same foam cushions...|$|R

The TRD prototype {{used in the present}} tests has a readout electrode of 25 µm thickness kapton foil having on both sides evaporated Al/Cr layers with the mentioned pad structure. The first version of the prototype was built with an anode-cathode distance of 3 mm (DSTRD-V 1) and a readout electrode with a double <b>sided</b> <b>pad</b> structure [2]- [3] similar with small size double sided TRD prototype which showed that such a geometry preserves the performance up to 2 x 10 5 part. ·cm − 2 ·s − 1 counting rate.

Both detectors were tested with the 5. 9 keV X-ray 55 Fe source using both the anode and pad signal, respectively. 80 % Ar + 20 % CO 2 gas mixture was flushed trough the counter. For pad signal processing we used the new FEE-Fast Analog signal Processor (FASP) [4] developed in our group.

40|$|Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) is {{a hallmark}} of generalized atherosclerosis.

In particular, we focus on the "hidden" <b>side</b> of <b>PAD</b> burden, the asymptomatic patients, who are at high risk of negative cardiovascular outcomes. Identification of such PAD patients is therefore an important clinical goal to reduce mortality and morbidity and reduce the social cost of atherosclerotic disease.
