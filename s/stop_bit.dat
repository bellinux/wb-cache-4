25|$|When a key of the {{teleprinter}} keyboard is pressed, a 5-bit {{character is}} generated. The teleprinter converts it to serial format and transmits {{a sequence of}} a start bit (a logical 0 or space), then {{one after the other}} the 5 data bits, finishing with a <b>stop</b> <b>bit</b> (a logical 1 or mark, lasting 1, 1.5 or 2 bits). When a sequence of start bit, 5 data bits and <b>stop</b> <b>bit</b> arrives at the input of the teleprinter, it is converted to a 5-bit word and passed to the printer or VDU. With electromechanical teleprinters, these functions required complicated electromechanical devices, but they are easily implemented with standard digital electronics using shift registers. Special integrated circuits have been developed for this function, for example the Intersil 6402 and 6403. These are stand-alone UART devices, similar to computer serial port peripherals.|$|E
25|$|A {{calibration}} header is sent {{before the}} image. It {{consists of a}} 300-millisecond leader tone at 1900Hz, a 10ms break at 1200Hz, another 300-millisecond leader tone at 1900Hz, followed by a digital VIS (vertical interval signaling) code, identifying the transmission mode used. The VIS consists of bits of 30 milliseconds in length. The code starts with a start bit at 1200Hz, followed by 7 data bits (LSB first; 1100Hz for 1, 1300Hz for 0). An even parity bit follows, then a <b>stop</b> <b>bit</b> at 1200Hz. For example, the bits corresponding the decimal numbers 44 or 32 imply that the mode is Martin M1, whereas the number 60 represents Scottie S1.|$|E

5000|$|Actually, {{more things}} {{will have been}} agreed in advance [...] - [...] the speed of bit transmission, the number of bits per character, the parity {{and the number of}} <b>stop</b> <b>bits</b> (signifying the end of a character). So a {{designation}} of 9600-8-E-2 would be 9,600 bits per second, with eight bits per character, even parity and two <b>stop</b> <b>bits.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{bit stream}} is stored as, Start bit - 0, LSB....MSB, 2 <b>stop</b> <b>bits.</b>|$|R

50|$|A common set-up of an {{asynchronous}} {{serial connection}} would be 9600-8-N-1 (9,600 bit/s, 8 bits per character, no parity and 1 <b>stop</b> <b>bit)</b> - {{a total of}} 10 bits transmitted to send one 8 bit character (one start bit, the 8 bits making up the byte transmitted and one <b>stop</b> <b>bit).</b> This is an overhead of 20%, so a 9,600 bit/s asynchronous serial link will not transmit data at 9600/8 bytes per second (1200 byte/s) but actually, in this case 9600/10 bytes per second (960 byte/s), which is considerably slower than expected.|$|E

5000|$|Asynchronous {{start-stop}} transmission uses start and <b>stop</b> <b>bits</b> to signify the beginning bit ASCII character {{would actually be}} transmitted using 10 bits. For example, [...] "0100 0001" [...] would become [...] "1 0100 0001 0". The extra one (or zero, depending on parity bit) at the start {{and end of the}} transmission tells the receiver first that a character is coming and secondly that the character has ended. This method of transmission is used when data are sent intermittently as opposed to in a solid stream. In the previous example the start and <b>stop</b> <b>bits</b> are in bold. The start and <b>stop</b> <b>bits</b> must be of opposite polarity. This allows the receiver to recognize when the second packet of information is being sent.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} protocol is ASCII with XON/XOFF flow control, using a 10-bit code (1 start bit, 7 data bits, even parity, 1 <b>stop</b> <b>bit).</b> No echo {{shall be}} employed in full duplex mode.|$|E
5000|$|The master then either ends {{transmission}} with a <b>stop</b> <b>bit,</b> {{or it may}} send another START bit if it {{wishes to}} retain control of the bus for another transfer (a [...] "combined message").|$|E

5000|$|Mark {{and space}} are terms {{describing}} logic levels in teleprinter circuits. The native mode of communication for a teleprinter {{is a simple}} series DC circuit that is interrupted, much as a rotary dial interrupts a telephone signal. The marking condition is when the circuit is closed (current is flowing), the spacing condition is when the circuit is open (no current is flowing). The [...] "idle" [...] condition of the circuit is a continuous marking state, with {{the start of a}} character signalled by a [...] "start bit", which is always a space. Following the start bit, the character is represented by a fixed number of bits, such as 5 bits in the ITA2 code, each either a mark or a space to denote the specific character or machine function. After the character's bits, the sending machine sends one or more <b>stop</b> <b>bits.</b> The <b>stop</b> <b>bits</b> are marking, so as to be distinct from the subsequent start bit. If the sender has nothing more to send, the line simply remains in the marking state (as if a continuing series of <b>stop</b> <b>bits)</b> until a later space denotes the start of the next character. The time between characters need not be an integral multiple of a bit time, but it must be at least the minimum number of <b>stop</b> <b>bits</b> required by the receiving machine.|$|R
50|$|The DCB is a {{standard}} asynchronous serial stream (using an 8251A IC in the Juno 60), LSB first, 8 data <b>bits,</b> 2 <b>stop</b> <b>bits,</b> odd parity, and a Baud rate of 31.25 kHz.|$|R
5000|$|... 8B/12B first sends an {{odd parity}} bit, {{followed}} by 8 bits (least-significant bit first), {{followed by an}} inversion bit, followed by a 1 (which is the start bit), and a 0 which is the <b>stop</b> <b>bit.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{address and}} the data bytes are sent most {{significant}} bit first.The start bit is indicated by a high-to-low transition of SDA with SCL high; the <b>stop</b> <b>bit</b> is indicated by a low-to-high transition of SDA with SCL high. All other transitions of SDA take place with SCL low.|$|E
50|$|Stop bits sent {{at the end}} {{of every}} {{character}} allow the receiving signal hardware to detect the end of a character and to resynchronise with the character stream. Electronic devices usually use one <b>stop</b> <b>bit.</b> If slow electromechanical teleprinters are used, one-and-one half or two stop bits are required.|$|E
5000|$|... 8-N-1 is {{a common}} {{shorthand}} notation for a serial port parameter setting or configuration in asynchronous mode, {{in which there are}} eight (8) data bits, no (N) parity bit, and one (1) <b>stop</b> <b>bit.</b> [...] As such, 8-N-1 is the most common configuration for PC serial communications today.|$|E
50|$|When {{the line}} is broken, the {{continuous}} spacing (open circuit, no current flowing) causes a receiving teleprinter to cycle continuously, {{even in the absence}} of <b>stop</b> <b>bits.</b> It prints nothing because the characters received are all zeros, the ITA2 blank (or ASCII) null character.|$|R
5000|$|Synchronous {{transmission}} uses no {{start and}} <b>stop</b> <b>bits,</b> but instead synchronizes transmission speeds {{at both the}} receiving and sending end of the transmission using clock signal(s) built into each component. A continual stream of data is then sent between the two nodes. Due to there being no start and <b>stop</b> <b>bits</b> the data transfer rate is quicker although more errors will occur, as the clocks will eventually get out of sync, and the receiving device would have the wrong time that had been agreed in the protocol for sending/receiving data, so some bytes could become corrupted (by losing bits). Ways to get around this problem include re-synchronization of the clocks and use of check digits to ensure the byte is correctly interpreted and received ...|$|R
50|$|This type of {{software}} {{is capable of}} emulating all serial port functionality, including Baud rate, data <b>bits,</b> parity <b>bits,</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bits,</b> etc. Additionally, it allows the data flow to be controlled, emulating all signal lines (DTR / DSR / CTS / RTS / DCD / RI) and customizing pinout.|$|R
5000|$|Between computers, {{the most}} common {{configuration}} used was [...] "8N1": eight bit characters, with one start bit, one <b>stop</b> <b>bit,</b> and no parity bit. Thus 10 Baud times are used to send a single character, and so dividing the signalling bit-rate by ten results in the overall transmission speed in characters per second.|$|E
