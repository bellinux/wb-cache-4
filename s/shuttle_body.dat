Minor design changes that improve structural integrity without having {{a significant impact on}} the thermal protection ability of the titanium multiwall TPS are identified.

40|$|A {{probabilistic}} analysis, {{using the}} 2 -parameter Weibull-Johnson method, {{was performed on}} experimental life test data from space shuttle actuator bearings. Experiments were performed on a test rig under simulated conditions to determine the life and failure mechanism of the grease lubricated bearings that support the input shaft of the space <b>shuttle</b> <b>body</b> flap actuators. The failure mechanism was wear that can cause loss of bearing preload. These tests established life and reliability data for both shuttle flight and ground operation. Test data were used to estimate the failure rate and reliability {{as a function of}} the number of shuttle missions flown. The Weibull analysis of the test data for a 2 -bearing shaft assembly in each body flap actuator established a reliability level of 99. 6 percent for a life of 12 missions. A probabilistic system analysis for four shuttles, each of which has four actuators, predicts a single bearing failure in one actuator of one shuttle after 22 missions (a total of 88 missions for a 4 -shuttle fleet). This prediction is comparable with actual shuttle flight history in which a single actuator bearing was found to have failed by wear at 20 missions...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to present a model for the prediction of the effect of the microgravity environment on the growth of Lead Tin Telluride. The attitude change and its relation to the experimental objectives: The {{main objective}} for the AADSF experiment on USMP 3 involving LTT growth was to estimate the effect of ampoule orientation on the axial and radial segregation of tin telluride. As the furnace was not situated on a gimbal there was no possibility to reorient the ampoule during the flight. Instead the only way to change the growth orientation was to change the attitude of the orbiter. This was accomplished by vernier rocket firings. In what follows {{it must be noted that}} the orbiter body coordinates are such that the positive z axis points outward from the 'belly', the positive 'x' axis points outwards from the nose and the positive 'y' axis points outwards from the starboard side. The furnace which was in the pay load had its axis aligned with the orbiter's 'z' axis with the hot end closest to the <b>shuttle</b> <b>body.</b> There were basically three orientations that were desired. These corresponded to the ampoule being seen as a heated from above (thermally stable-solutally unstable) configuration, the heated from below (where the instabilities were reversed from the first orientation) configuration and an 'in between' case where the ampoule axis was misaligned with respect to the orbiters 'g(sub z) ' axis...|$|E

40|$|The Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>body</b> flap (BF) {{is located}} beneath the main engine nozzles and is {{required}} for proper aerodynamic control during orbital descent. The body flap is controlled by four actuators connected by a common shaft and driven by the hydraulic power drive unit. Inspection of the actuators during refurbishment revealed three shaft bearings with unexpected damage. One was coated with black oxide on the balls and race wear surfaces, a second contained a relatively deep wear scar, and the third with scratches and an aluminum particle in the wear track. A shaft bearing life test program was initiated to measure the wear life and explain the 5. 08 -micrometer wear scar. A tribological analysis was conducted {{to demonstrate that the}} black oxide coated wear surfaces did not damage the bearing, interfere with the lubrication, or cause severe bearing wear. Pre-damaged (equivalent of 30 missions), commercial equivalent bearings and previously flown shaft bearings were tested at axial loads, speeds, and temperatures seen during flight operations. These bearing were successfully life tested at 60 C for 24 hours or 90 flights. With a safety factor of 4 X, the bearings were qualified for 22 flights when only a maximum of 12 flights are expected. Additional testing at 23 C was performed to determine the lubricant life and to further understand the mechanism that caused the blackened balls. Test results indicating bearing life was shortened at a lower temperature surprised the investigators. Start bearing testing that closely simulates mission profile was conducted at 23 C. Results of this testing showed lubricant life of 12 flights including a safety factor of four. Additional testing with bearings that have the equivalent of 30 missions of damage is being tested at 23 C. These tests are being performed over the Shuttle load profile to demonstrate the residual bearing life in the actuators exceeds 12 missions. Testing showed {{that the end of the}} shaft bearing life was characterized by bearing temperature rise, preload drop, and the onset of a severe wear bearing failure mechanism.

40|$|An engineering-type {{procedure}} is presented for computing normal-force, axial-force, and pitching-moment coefficients for bodies at angles of attack from 0 deg to 180 deg.

Participants included 41 undergraduates who were considered to be "physical fit" (n = 21, Males = 15) or "physically unfit" (n = 20, Males = 17).

In general, kinesins with N-terminal motor domains move their cargo towards the plus ends of microtubules located at the cell periphery, while kinesins with C-terminal motor domains move cargo towards the minus ends of microtubules located at the nucleus. Fourteen distinct kinesin families are known, with some additional kinesin-like proteins that cannot be classified into these families.|$|R

Participants completed a battery of field tests to assess sprinting speed (40 m sprint), acceleration ability (10 m sprint), change of direction speed (505 test), anaerobic capacity (300 m <b>shuttle),</b> lower <b>body</b> power (vertical jump) and repeated sprint ability, as well as the 30 - 15 Intermittent Fitness Test to determine the velocity of intermittent fitness (VIFT). Relationships between anaerobic tests and VIFT were quantified via Pearson product moment correlations, and a two-predictor model multiple linear regression estimated the predictive relationships between the exercise tests and the VIFT. Multiple linear regression showed VIFT significantly predicted 56 %, 51 %, 44 %, 36 %, 12 % and 1 % {{of the variance in the}} 300 m shuttle, repeated sprint, 505, 40 m sprint, vertical jump and 10 m sprint tests, respectively. The two-predictor model determined 300 m shuttle and repeated sprint performance accounted for 67 % of the variance in VIFT. These findings highlight that various anaerobic characteristics contribute to the intermittent fitness qualities that are quantified through VIFT. More specifically, these data indicate that VIFT is useful for tracking performance in tasks largely determined by anaerobic capacity, but may not be a good predictor of brief all-out sprinting and jumping efforts...|$|R
