He later appeared in the television commercial for Gwalior Suiting on the insistence of a family friend, and was subsequently cast by director Anand Mahindroo. The project eventually got cancelled but [...] Khan relocated to Mumbai {{to pursue a career}} in film; he recalls, [...] "Finally I had some direction and focus. I remember [...] feeling so excited that I could go to Mumbai, <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own place and enjoy the adventure of starting my own career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Duc Tran Van, who {{was seven}} {{years old at the time}} of My Lai {{massacre}} and now resides in Remscheid, Germany, called the apology [...] "terse".

2500|$|The Mighty B premiered on April 26, 2008, {{which was}} the morning after Poehler's film Baby Mama had premiered.

2500|$|In 1988 Fish {{described}} the slow {{process by which}} most of her work evolved. She said, [...] "It's very unusual that I'll see something, go to the studio, draw it and paint it. That rarely happens. I'll see it and it will <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head for a while, and maybe later I'll {{try to figure out}} through drawing what I saw. But sometimes it's a delay of two months, or four or six. That's part of the distilling, getting a sense of what's literal there, what's tangible and intangible, what's abstract and some other kind of order." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Onze notations were {{an early}} attempt to orchestrate eleven of the Douze notations pour piano (1946). In the mid-1970s Boulez {{embarked}} on a second, more radical transformation of these short piano pieces into extended works for large orchestra, a project which pre-occupied him {{to the end of}} his life, nearly seventy years after the original composition. This is only the most extreme example of a lifelong tendency to revisit earlier works: [...] "as long as my ideas have not exhausted every possibility of proliferation they <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind." [...] Piencikowski characterises this in part as [...] "an obsessional concern for perfection" [...] and observes that with some pieces (such as Le Visage nuptial) [...] "one could speak of successive distinct versions, each one presenting a particular state of the musical material, without the successor invalidating the previous one or vice versa"—although he notes that Boulez almost invariably vetoed the performance of previous versions. Reflecting on the relatively small number of works Boulez completed, the composer George Benjamin wrote: [...] "The world today doesn't need huge numbers of pieces, as it did in, say, Haydn's time. What are needed, surely, are essential statements, singular and unique works. And these he has provided, without question." ...|$|E
