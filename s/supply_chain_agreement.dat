30|$|Quantity {{flexibility}} {{is one of}} the most widely discussed forms of non-price coordination. Quantity flexibilities allow the buyer to get a different quantity than the earlier estimate (Lariviere 1999; Fugate et al. 2010) and this can be provided in various ways, such as minimum purchase quantity agreement (Bassok and Anupindi 1997), backup agreements that allow a customer to purchase higher quantities than initial amounts they ordered (Eppen and Iyer 1997) Quantity flexibility also considered as a major form of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>agreement</b> (Tsay 1999). Sharafali and Co (2000) also suggested different types of coordination systems, for instance, price fluctuation and quantity discounts. Apart from it, the determinants such as flexibility, mutual benefit, harmonization of conflict, and information sharing are also found to be crucial in coordinating supply chains (Achrol and Gregory 1999; Carson Stephen et al. 1999; Houston and Johnson 2000; Jap Sandy and Ganesan 2000; Maloni and Benton 2000; Poppo and Zenger 2002).|$|E
30|$|It is well {{recognized}} {{that in order}} to combat climate change, GHG emissions need to be managed from the supply chain perspective. This paper moves one more step forward on the base of literature by introducing one concept—supply chain emission trading and one framework in addressing emission trading in the context of supply chains. To implement the supply chain emission trading, this paper proposed to assign the responsibility of supply chain GHG emissions to the focal company in the supply chain by including the scope 3 emissions of the focal company into ETS. Moreover, this paper discerns itself from others by identifying risks for supply chains under emission trading program. From a corporate perspective, these risks are from policy instability, market variation, <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>agreement</b> dispute, green investment uncertainty, and supply chain GHG emission accounting failure. Moreover, based on the concept of supply chain risks, this paper attributes green investment risks to internal and external risks, policy and market risks to supply chain environmental risks, accounting risks to internal risks, and agreement risks to external risks.|$|E

This paper uses a simple economic modeling framework {{to understand how}} the global fragmentation phenomenon may reshape the WTO, and particularly its developing country members that are most affected by the rise in global production sharing and foreign direct investment. The paper argues that the surge in global production sharing, <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>agreements,</b> and investment has not only recast the role of existing GATT/WTO rules, but that these same forces also create a strong rationale for new multilateral disciplines pertaining to investment incentives and other 'behind-the-border' policies...|$|R

Value <b>chains</b> (or <b>supply</b> <b>chains)</b> play an {{important}} role in business today, but because many attorneys do not understand how <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> differ from conventional sale of goods contracts, they may have difficulty contributing value to the process of negotiating <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> deals. Thinking of <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> as being either adversarial or collaborative can help managers work with their lawyers to identify the right contract terms for a much wider range of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> business models. Hot spots in <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>agreements</b> include harmonizing risk allocations, technology implementation, performance metrics, forecasting, intellectual property rights and termination. The Nature of the Problem. What are value chains (also known as <b>supply</b> <b>chains)</b> and how do they differ from older systems for managing production and distribution of goods and services? A <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> can be defined as an integrated network of firms sequentially involved in the production and distribution of goods and services. These networks have grown in number and economic significance in recent years. Among the forces spurring <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> expansion are increased competition caused by the global integration of product markets, greater profits possible in a well managed <b>supply</b> <b>chain,</b> and advances in informatio...|$|R

40|$|The Largo {{manufacturing}} {{site of the}} Raytheon Company is a pure production facility with limited collocated design capabilities. All of the initial design and development engineering is done in four external sites - Marlborough, MA; St. Petersburg, FL; Towson, MD; and Ft. Wayne, IN - before final specifications are "thrown over the wall" to Largo for production. Because manufacturing is geographically sequestered there are numerous organizational and informational disconnects. Accountability is not easy with four distinct program management offices; each has equally distinct incentives and needs, and expects stellar results from the Largo production staff. Materials normally account for approximately 75 % of the total costs for a standard manufacturing operation. Largo is no different; however its material costs are often even higher than this benchmark for unique reasons. Difficulties arise for Largo in structuring its <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>agreements</b> because the four design sites have disparate material requirements and harbor unique supplier preferences. A salient symbol of the challenges faced by the site's <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management group is {{the millions of dollars}} worth of inventory that sits in the vast factory storeroom. Current inventory floor accuracy is at an unacceptable level of 85. 3 %. (cont.) Getting rid of the inventory monster and its attendant problems is no trivial task, and certainly not one that could be accomplished in a six month LFM internship. But steps were taken to help get the ball rolling in the right direction and to generate some quick wins in the near term. The first phase of the project involved the creation of a novel sourcing agreement with a key CCA supplier. The second phase involved optimizing the replenishment system to minimize material flow, implement pull, and increase material accountability. The final phase involved creation of a financial cost v. benefit model to standardize the site's methodology for making sourcing and partnering decisions in the future. All of these topics are discussed in this thesis as shown in the table of contents. Overview of main internship project tasks: The internship project was scoped to fit within the six and one half month allotted time period and was structured around the main problem points I have just briefly touched upon: 1. Identify optimal candidate supplier and part with potential for significant SMI cost savings. 2. Structure SMI supplier partnership agreement. 3. Implement and automate calculation of kanban system to control inventory 4. Create SMI cost v. benefit tool to prioritize future projects according to expected returns on investment. by Colin Ducharme. Thesis (S. M.)

Both in literature and in commercial <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management systems, a centralised approach to <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> planning is frequently proposed. Due to the incongruence between incentives of the firms involved in the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> and overall <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> objectives, a centralised <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> planning will either not be accepted or will not lead to system-wide effectiveness.

Also, the authors look at the relation between <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> responsiveness and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach – Applying the strategic-choice theory and the resource-based view of firms to the <b>supply</b> <b>chain,</b> the authors develop a research model to demonstrate the premise that implementing proper <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> practices to support and execute <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> strategy will enhance the responsiveness of the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> and the performance of the focal firm. The study utilizes survey data from 205 senior executives and managers in the purchasing and <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> functions from manufacturing firms in the USA. The results are based on covariance-based analysis and structural equation modeling using AMOS software. Findings – The study finds that strategic supplier partnership fully mediates the relationship between a lean <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> strategy and <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> responsiveness, and that postponement partially mediates the relationship between an agile <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> strategy and <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> responsiveness.

Secondly, it presents the development of a theoretically grounded classification based on which <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> level-, product-and countryspecific characteristics of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> governance structures are investigated. Thirdly, it investigates if <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> cluster around performance based on the perspectives of all <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> members. Fourthly, it studies the relationships between <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> relationships and performance. Fifthly, it explores the differences in performance within <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> Some of the empirical contributions of this PhD dissertation are worth mentioning. In the frame of this PhD dissertation, the focus is on <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> level analysis (as compared to firm level analysis), collecting data from minimum three firms from one <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> Further, this PhD dissertation can be considered as a multiple chain (Chapter 2 investigates nine <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> Chapter 3 investigates 27 <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> and Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 investigates 90 <b>supply</b> <b>chains).</b> Besides, it benchmarks performance between and within <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> These contributions can be considered as extensions and/or innovations as compared to the state of the art. The result of this PhD dissertation highlights the existence of common (i. e. <b>supply</b> <b>chain)</b> goals, and confirms that a wide range of these goals are both relevant and important for consumers. Further, it reveals a certain diversity of governance structures along the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> as well as across products and countries. Besides, this PhD dissertation concludes that <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> cluster around performance based on the perspectives of all <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> members {{and that there is a}} significant relationship between <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> relationships and performance. Last, it shows that there are differences in performance within <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> and develops a taxonomy of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> performance imbalance...|$|R

This paper investigates a framework {{for the implementation of}} green <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> practices. Innovative organizations devise new ways to implement green <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> practices. The paper provides a brief literature review of green <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> practice and inhibitors & consequences of green <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> are also introduced.

The mechanism on the selection of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> structures and quality improvement strategies of the two <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> is described. In particular, we analyze three possible structure combinations: two integrated <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> two decentralized <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> and one integrated and one decentralized <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> Between the <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> Nash's non-cooperative game is implemented. Numerical experiments illustrate the mechanism and some related issues are discussed. <b>Supply</b> <b>chain</b> Competition Coordination Quality improvement...|$|R

Three main components of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management; global <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> approach, <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> business process, and network structure of <b>supply</b> <b>chain,</b> has been adopted to examine why firm strategically employed global <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management, its formulation, reformation process, and <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> network style pattern. It was suggested that the firm has successfully employed <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management strategy to strengthen its competitive advantage through shorter business process lead time. The {{study also found that}} the firm employed global efficiency approach and internal network type pattern in implementing its global <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management strategy...|$|R
40|$|In today's {{business}} environment, harsher {{and more}} frequent natural and man-made disasters make <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> more vulnerable. <b>Supply</b> <b>chain</b> disruptions {{now seem to}} occur more frequently and with more serious consequences. During and after <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> disruptions, companies may lose revenue and incur high recovery costs. If <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> managers were more capable of measuring and managing <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> vulnerability, they could {{reduce the number of}} disruptions and their impact. In this research we developed an approach based on graph theory to quantify and hence mitigate <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> vulnerability. Quantification of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> vulnerability aids managers in assessing the vulnerability of their <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> (e. g., across and between <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> or over time) and in comparing the effectiveness of different risk mitigation strategies. <b>Supply</b> <b>chain</b> management Risk management Vulnerability Graph theory Measurement Large-scale survey...|$|R

APICS' certification is called Certified <b>Supply</b> <b>Chain</b> Professional, or CSCP, and ISCEA'S certification is called the Certified <b>Supply</b> <b>Chain</b> Manager (CSCM), CISCM (Chartered Institute of <b>Supply</b> <b>Chain</b> Management) awards certificate as Chartered <b>Supply</b> <b>Chain</b> Management Professional (CSCMP). Another, the Institute for Supply Management, is developing one called the Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM) focused on the procurement and sourcing areas of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management. The <b>Supply</b> <b>Chain</b> Management Association (SCMA) is the main certifying body for Canada with the designations having global reciprocity. The designation <b>Supply</b> <b>Chain</b> Management Professional (SCMP) is the title of the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> leadership designation.|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. <b>Supply</b> <b>chains</b> {{members are}} {{disperser}} across multiple geographical locations and the competitive effects of globalisation has provoked the agile capacity of contemporary <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> This {{makes it more}} difficult for <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> organisation to meet consumer demands, especially if <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> processes are not adequately streamlined. This confronted <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> managers with the daunting task to make informed decisions regarding critical business drivers within their organisations. Incorrect decisions can lead to counter-productive actions. <b>Supply</b> <b>chain</b> members both upstream and downstream often make decisions based on their immediate environment and resources available, thereby not considering other factor within the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> holistically. This perspective has change and <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> managers need to make decision based on the overall information and resources available within the entire <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> network. The need to evaluate the appropriate <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> performance measures is critical, as it directly affects the performance of the entire <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> network. The focus of this thesis revolves around the linear composition of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> technology, integration, collaboration and visibility to maximise <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> agility. The objective of this thesis is therefore to present a model that highlights the roadmap to achieving <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> visibility followed by <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> agility. This will allow <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> members to make informed decisions around key drivers within the <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> The intention of the model is to provide a guideline approach toward achieving <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> agility through a process of welldefined analysis in areas such as <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> technology, integration, collaboration and visibility. The method used to develop the model in this thesis is build on the scientific principle of adding smaller pieces of the different <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management theories to corroborate the context and value of the model. These <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management theories combined provides valuable guidance for the roadmap towards achieving <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> agility. The point of departure is a simple five-step model of which its validity is legitimised through a case study research, conducted on two <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> partners. The findings from this case study have contextualised the model into a definite treasure map towards achieving success in the face of globalisation...|$|R
