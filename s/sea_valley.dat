40|$|Abstract—Thirty-six {{springs and}} wells from the Dead <b>Sea</b> Rift <b>Valley</b> were {{periodically}} sampled and analyzed. The latter included full chemical analyses, 222 Rn and 226 Ra (by a-counting emanometry), {{as well as}} 228 Ra/ 226 Ra and 224 Ra/ 228 Ra activity ratios (g spectrometry). Sampling stretched over almost 2 yr. Several hundred Rn-Ra analyses and close to a hundred isotopic ratios were measured. Most waters in the Rift Valley have both elevated Ra (several to 750 dpm/L) and Rn (a few hundred to almost 60, 000 dpm/L) content. In practically all samples 222 Rn activity considerably exceeds that of its parent 226 Ra. The Ra content {{is the result of}} all Dead <b>Sea</b> Rift <b>Valley</b> waters being mixtures of fresh water with saline brines. Ra is efficiently extracted from surrounding rocks into the brine end member. 228 Ra/ 226 Ra ratios are exceptionally low 20. 07 to 0. 9, mostly less than 0. 2. This apparently reflects the U over Th enrichment in the source rocks that contribute the Ra. Ra enrichment (both 228 Ra and 226 Ra) is locally correlated throughout the Rift Valley with water salinity. This correlation can be used to constrain the age of the brine-freshwater mixing process. In one of the hydrologic subsystems studied (the Fuliya block), the mixing of the shallow ground water must have occurred in less than 200 to 300 yr ago, probably before no more than some 30 yr. High radon activities in surface waters along the Dead <b>Sea</b> Rift <b>Valley</b> result from the formation of radium-enriched linings on the aquifer rock surface. The mixing of the radium-extracting brines with fresh water leads to continual adsorption of radium as water salinity decreases. The unique combination of fast upward flow and continual mixing in the Dead <b>Sea</b> Rift <b>Valley</b> accounts for a constant replenishment of radium in the waters. This causes a gradual buildup of a radium lining on the aquifer walls until eventually a steady-state surface activity is established. Copyrigh...|$|R

40|$|The {{area of the}} Dead <b>Sea</b> <b>valley</b> and the {{adjacent}} regions are often affected by mineral dust. This study focuses on an extreme dust episode occurring on 22 March 2013, where near-surface dust concentrations of up to 7000 µg m− 3 were encountered in the Dead Sea region. This episode is of great interest as it was accompanied by high wind speeds and a gust front that rapidly passed the Judean Mountains. Wind was even accelerated on the lee side of the Judean Mountains leading to a severe downslope wind. We simulated this situation with the comprehensive online-coupled weather forecast model COSMO-ART. Fair agreement {{was found between the}} simulated meteorological variables and the observations. The model was capable of producing a reasonable spatiotemporal distribution of near-surface dust concentration, consistent with available measurements in this area. With respect to the time of the maximum near-surface dust concentration in the Dead <b>Sea</b> <b>valley,</b> the model captured it almost perfectly compared to the observed total suspended particle (TSP) concentrations. COSMO-ART showed that the high near-surface dust concentration in the Dead <b>Sea</b> <b>valley</b> was mainly determined by local emissions. These emissions were caused by strong winds on the lee side of the Judean Mts. The model showed that an ascending airflow in the Dead <b>Sea</b> <b>valley</b> lifted dust particles, originating mainly from the upwind side of the Judean Mts., up to approximately 7 km. These dust particles contributed to the pronounced maximum in modelled dust aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the valley.

40|$|Abstract: Morphological, seismic-reflection, and sedimentological {{evidence}} indicates that glacial ice tongues cut large sea valleys intothe Gulf of Alaska continental shelf during the Pleistocene. During the Holocene, glacially-derived sediments from the Copper River and other meltwater streams have been prograding seaward across the shelf, covering the glacial and glacimarine upper Yakataga diamicts that blanketed the shelf and accumulated on the upper slope seaward of the sea valleys during the Pleistocene.

Concentrations of CO₂ in the groundwaters vary from 2. 62 to 38. 4 (x 10 ⁻² cm³ STP/g H₂O). ³He/⁴He ratios vary from 0. 18 to 2. 23 RA (where RA = air ³He/⁴He), with Salton <b>Sea,</b> Coachella <b>Valley</b> and San Bernardino containing median ³He/⁴He ratios of 1. 17 RA, 0. 64 RA, and 1. 37 RA, respectively.
