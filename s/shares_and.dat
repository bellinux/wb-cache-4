The municipal take-over resulted in an upgrade to both the track and the rolling stock. New overhead wires and new and heavier track were laid. From 1978, the T1300 trains were taken into use. With the take-over, the lines were numbered, and the Sognsvann Line designated 81, although this was quickly changed to 13.|$|E

Finally in 1813, they agreed to amalgamate, and the action was authorised by a further Act of Parliament. The Ellesmere company paid just half of their 1804 offer, and the 500 Ellesmere shares were distributed between the various Chester shareholders. The Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company took over on 1 July 1813. A new section of canal and an iron lock were built at Beeston in 1827, to resolve continual problems with leakage there.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sharing</b> <b>and</b> {{integrating}} Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System/Science (GIS) {{models are}} critical for developing practical application systems. Facilitating model <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> model integration {{is a problem for}} model publishers and model users, respectively. To address this problem, a framework based on a Web service for <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> integrating RS and GIS models is proposed in this paper. The fundamental idea of the framework is to publish heterogeneous RS and GIS models into standard Web services for <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> interoperation and then to integrate the RS and GIS models using Web services. For the former, a “black box” and a visual method are employed to facilitate the publishing of the models as Web services. For the latter, model integration based on the geospatial workflow and semantic supported marching method is introduced. Under this framework, model <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> integration is applied for developing the Pearl River Delta water environment monitoring system. The results show that the framework can facilitate model <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> model integration for model publishers and model users...|$|R

5|$|John Rennie {{surveyed}} {{the line for}} a ship canal {{from the mouth of}} the River Parrett to Seaton in 1810, which was designed for ships of , but it was felt that the economic situation would not support the projected expenditure of over £1million. He then considered a more modest proposal, based on the original Bristol and Western plans, and the scheme, now renamed the Bristol and Taunton Canal, was authorised by an Act of Parliament dated 14 May 1811. The company had powers to raise £420,000 in <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> an additional £150,000 if required, but economic concerns meant that the project did not start immediately. Powers for the Bristol to Bridgwater section lapsed in 1815, but work finally commenced in 1822, to be halted by an injunction because the authorised route was not being followed. A further Act, of 17 June 1824, authorised the revised route, and changed the name of the project to the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal Company. The predicted costs for the construction of the shorter canal were £34,145, as opposed to £429,990 for the longer scheme.|$|E

5|$|The Celts practiced {{advanced}} {{agriculture and}} favored fertile lands; they {{brought with them}} and disseminated the inventions, including a variety of tools, and other achievements of La Tène culture. Celtic farmers used plows with iron <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> fertilized fields with animal manure. Their livestock consisted of selected breeds, especially sheep and large cattle. The rotational querns that they invented had a stationary lower stone and an upper one rotated by a lever. Iron was obtained in greater quantities from locally available turf ores; its metallurgy and processing were improved, resulting in the manufacturing of stronger and more resistant tools and weapons. The ceramic shops used the potter's wheel and produced with great precision (especially the Tyniec group) baked, thin walled, painted vessels, {{one of the best}} in Europe. Domed bilevel furnaces were used, the pots being placed on a perforated clay shelf, with the hearth underneath. Glass and enamel were produced, gold and semi-precious stones were processed for jewelry.|$|E
5|$|The Glazers' {{shareholding}} increased {{gradually to}} 76.2% by 23 May, {{when they made}} their final offer of 300 pence per share, with a deadline of 3p.m. on 13 June. On 26 May, the Manchester United board wrote to the remaining shareholders indicating their intention to sell their own <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> advising the others to follow suit; in the same letter, chairman Sir Roy Gardner and non-executive directors Ian Much and Jim O'Neill offered their resignations. Despite the board's encouragement, the Glazers' share in the club had only reached 97.3% by 14 June, short of the 97.6% threshold required for a compulsory buyout of all remaining shareholders, prompting them to extend the deadline on their offer to purchase the remaining shares until 27 June. A statement released on 28 June said that Red Football's shareholding had reached 98% (259,950,194 shares), prompting a squeeze out of the remaining shareholders. The final valuation of the club was almost £790million (approximately $1.5billion at the exchange rate at the time).|$|E
5|$|The Parrett Navigation Act {{allowed the}} proprietors, of whom 25 were named, to raise £10,500 in <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> £3,300 by mortgage, {{with which to}} make {{improvements}} to the river from Burrow Bridge to Langport, to reconstruct the restrictive bridge at Langport, and to continue the improvements as far as Thorney. The River Isle, which joined the Parrett at Muchelney, was to be improved for its first mile, and then the Westport Canal was to be constructed from there to Westport. Locks were planned at Stanmoor, Langport, and Muchelney, with a half-lock at Thorney. An extra lock was added at Oath, when tests revealed that the depth of water would not meet that specified in the Act without it. Costs were considerably higher than expected, and a second Act of Parliament was obtained in 1839, to allow an extra £20,000 to be raised.

On 22 March 1733, Hill, in a letter to Benjamin Victor, a dramatist who had arranged the sale of Booth's shares to Highmore, criticised {{the fact that he was}} kept from buying into the theatre's management and attacked Theophilus. He offered 900 pounds for three years for Booth's <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> 1800 pounds for Mary Wilks's shares. Negotiations continued until May when they were dropped.

5|$|Dolan was {{dismissed}} in May 2003, the new board citing financial {{reasons for his}} departure. At 27 years, York player Chris Brass was appointed player-manager in June 2003, which made him the youngest Football League managerial appointment since 1946. The club's lease of Bootham Crescent was extended to May 2004, and plans proceeded to develop Huntington Stadium ahead of a possible move, but problems bringing the ground to Football League standards were encountered. The board preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent, and they bought the site in February 2004 {{after six months of}} negotiations. The deal came after York were lent £2million by The Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF), with which they bought 75.89% of BCH <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> all of the 20,000 shares owned by Persimmon. Once plans for a new stadium were settled, the loan would be converted a grant to help fund the move. York equalled a club record by winning the first four matches of 2003–04, and by mid January 2004 were 10th in the table. They won none of their final 20 fixtures, garnering only five more points as they finished bottom of the Third Division. York were relegated to the Conference National after 75 years of Football League membership. Beck renounced his title of chairman in September 2004 because he favoured a more democratic approach for a fan-owned club. The board was restructured and Jason McGill became the managing director.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 the Clifton Bridge Company {{was set up}} {{to oversee}} the final stages of {{completion}} and manage the operation of the bridge. They paid £50 each year to the trustees who gradually purchased the shares in the company. The revenues from tolls were minimal initially as there was not much traffic; however, this increased after 1920 with greater car ownership. In 1949 the trustees purchased all the outstanding <b>shares</b> <b>and</b> debentures. The bridge is managed by a charitable trust, originally formed by the Society of Merchant Venturers following Vick's bequest. The trust was authorised to manage the bridge and collect tolls by Acts of Parliament in 1952, 1980 and 1986. A toll of £0.50 has been levied on vehicles since 2007, but the £0.05 toll that the Act allows for cyclists or pedestrians is not collected. Human toll collectors were replaced by automated machines in 1975. The tolls are used to pay for the upkeep of the bridge, including the strengthening of the chain anchor points, which was done in 1925 and 1939, and regular painting and maintenance, which is carried out from a motorised cradle slung beneath the deck. By 2008 over 4 million vehicles crossed the bridge each year.|$|E

Along with traditional methods of load <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> job scheduling, it also examines methods referred to as epoch load <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> epoch scheduling respectively. Epoch load sharing evenly distributes the load among workstations with job migration that occurs {{only at the end}} of predefined intervals. The time interval between successive load sharing events is called an epoch. The objective is {{to reduce the number of}} times that global system information is needed to make allocation decisions, while at the same time achieving good overall performance and fairness of individual job service. In the epoch scheduling case, processor queues are rearranged only at the end of epochs. The objective is to find an epoch that minimizes the number of queue rearrangements, while being fair and producing good system performance. Simulation is used to measure performance issues associated with load <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> job scheduling.
