5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2007, UBS became the first Wall Street firm to announce a heavy loss in the <b>subprime</b> mortgage sector as the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis began to develop. In May 2007, UBS announced the closure of its Dillon Read Capital Management (DRCM) division. Before that time, there was little understanding of the troubles at DRCM or the massive expansion of risk engineered by the investment banking division {{under the leadership of}} the newly placed CEO Huw Jenkins.|$|E
5|$|UBS {{announced}} in February 2009 {{that it had}} lost nearly CHF 20billion (US$17.2billion) in 2008, the biggest single-year loss of any company in Swiss history. Since {{the beginning of the}} financial crisis in 2007, UBS has written down more than US$50billion from <b>subprime</b> mortgage investments and cut more than 11,000 jobs.|$|E
5|$|As {{disclosed}} {{under the}} Swiss Stock exchange Act, {{the most significant}} shareholders of UBS are GIC Private Limited with 7.07%, BlackRock Inc with 4.89%, Norges Bank with 3.30%, MFS Investment Management with 3.05% and Capital Group Companies with 3.01% of total share capital. In 2008 during the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis, GIC Private Limited invested CHF 11 billion into UBS to help bail it out, thus becoming the largest single shareholder.|$|E
5|$|On 14 September 2007, the Northern Rock Bank {{sought and}} {{received}} a liquidity support facility from the Bank of England, following problems in the credit markets during the financial crisis of 2007–2010. The government took Northern Rock into public ownership in February 2008 {{as a result of}} its financial problems caused by the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} major bailouts were pursued during the {{financial}} crisis, starting on 7 September with {{the announcement that}} the U.S. Government was to nationalise the two government-sponsored enterprises which oversaw most of the U.S. <b>subprime</b> mortgage market – Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In October, Alistair Darling, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, referred to Keynes as he announced plans for substantial fiscal stimulus to head off the worst effects of recession, in accordance with Keynesian economic thought. Similar policies have been adopted by other governments worldwide.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a report}} by the Diário de Notícias, Portugal had allowed {{considerable}} slippage in state-managed public works and inflated top management and head officer bonuses and wages in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010. Persistent and lasting recruitment policies boosted the number of redundant public servants. Risky credit, public debt creation, and European structural and cohesion funds were mismanaged across almost four decades. When the global crisis disrupted the markets and the world economy, together with the US <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis and the eurozone crisis, Portugal {{was one of the first}} economies to succumb, and was affected very deeply.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to other European banks, UBS suffered {{among the largest}} losses during the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis, and it was required to raise large amounts of outside capital. The bank received a US$9.7 billion capital injection in 2007 from the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (currently GIC Private Limited effective from July 2013), which {{remains one of the}} bank's largest shareholders. UBS also received capital from the Swiss government, further complemented by a series of equity offerings in 2007, 2008, and 2009.|$|E
5|$|KFN was {{an early}} {{casualty}} of the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis and in September 2007, Henry Kravis and George Roberts injected $270 million into the company. On February 20, 2008, KFN was once again forced to delay the repayment {{of billions of dollars}} of commercial paper, and began a new round of talks with creditors. In April, KFN sold a controlling interest in a real estate subsidiary to an investment firm to raise cash and entered an agreement with the noteholders of certain secured commercial paper issued by two asset-backed entities. Following the transaction, KFN converted from a REIT to a LLC.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{has been}} a member of the House Financial Services Committee since his first term. According to CQ, Lynch {{supported}} President George W. Bush's agenda one-third of the time, which was average for Democratic House members. For instance, he supported the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which addressed the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis, but opposed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 which created the Troubled Asset Relief Program. He has supported President Barack Obama's economic agenda, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.|$|E
5|$|A win by McCain over Huckabee in South Carolina, and by Romney over McCain in childhood-home Michigan, set up {{a pivotal}} battle in the Florida primary. Romney campaigned intensively on {{economic}} issues and the burgeoning <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis, while McCain attacked Romney regarding Iraq policy and benefited from endorsements from Florida officeholders. McCain won a 5percentage point victory on January 29. Although many Republican officials were now lining up behind McCain, Romney persisted through the nationwide Super Tuesday contests on February 5. There he won primaries or caucuses in several states, but McCain won in more and in larger-population ones. Trailing McCain in delegates by a more than two-to-one margin, Romney announced {{the end of his}} campaign on February 7.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, Blair {{resigned}} {{as the leader}} of the Labour Party and Gordon Brown, previously the Chancellor of the Exchequer, succeeded him following the 2007 Labour Party conference. Three years earlier, Blair had announced that he would not be contesting a fourth successive general election as Labour Party leader if he won the 2005 general election. Brown initially had strong public support and plans for a quick general election were widely publicised, though never officially announced. On 18th February 2008, Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that the failing bank, Northern Rock, would be nationalised, supporting it with loans and guarantees of £50,000,000,000. The bank had been destabilised by the US <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis the previous year, and a private buyer of the bank could not be found.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, McCain {{said he was}} {{temporarily}} suspending his campaign activities, called on Obama to join him, and proposed delaying {{the first of the}} general election debates with Obama, in order to work on the proposed U.S. financial system bailout before Congress, which was targeted at addressing the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis and liquidity crisis. McCain's intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement. After Obama declined McCain's suspension suggestion, McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26. On October 1, McCain voted in favor of a revised $700 billion rescue plan. Another debate was held on October 7; like the first one, polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it. A final presidential debate occurred on October 15.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix has {{maintained}} a growth streak in recent years, growing by 24.2% before 2007. This made it the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, surpassed only by Las Vegas. In 2008, Squaw Peak, the second tallest mountain in the city, was renamed Piestewa Peak after Army Specialist Lori Ann Piestewa, an Arizonan and the first Native American woman to die in combat while serving in the U.S. military, {{as well as being}} the first American female casualty of the 2003 Iraq War. 2008 also saw Phoenix as one of the cities hardest hit by the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis, and by early 2009 the median home price was $150,000, down from its $262,000 peak in 2007. Crime rates in Phoenix have gone down in recent years, and once troubled, decaying neighborhoods such as South Mountain, Alhambra, and Maryvale have recovered and stabilized. Recently, downtown Phoenix and the central core have experienced renewed interest and growth, resulting in numerous restaurants, stores, and businesses opening or relocating to central Phoenix.|$|E
25|$|<b>Subprime</b> borrowers will {{typically}} have lower incomes, tainted credited histories, or both.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{meltdown}} of the <b>subprime</b> mortgage {{industry in}} March 2007, Schumer proposed {{a federal government}} bailout of <b>subprime</b> borrowers {{in order to save}} homeowners from losing their residences and to shore up communities that were seeing neighborhoods destabilized due to foreclosures and the resulting decreases in neighboring home values. As part of a package of regulatory reforms that Schumer has pushed in response to the <b>subprime</b> foreclosure crisis, he called for the creation of mortgage industry regulators to protect borrowers from deceptive lending practices and called for the Securities and Exchange Commission to relocate from Washington to New York so that it was in closer proximity to the industry it was charged with overseeing.|$|E
25|$|He {{also helped}} to create the Hope Now Alliance to help {{struggling}} homeowners during the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis.|$|E
25|$|Minsky's {{economic}} theories {{were largely}} ignored for decades, until the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis of 2008 caused {{a renewed interest}} in them.|$|E
25|$|In August 2007, Secretary Paulson {{explained}} that U.S. <b>subprime</b> mortgage fallout remained largely contained {{due to the}} strongest global economy in decades.|$|E
25|$|<b>Subprime</b> {{mortgages}} {{generally have}} weaker credit scores {{as well as}} little to no verification of income or assets, high debt-to-income ratios, etc.|$|E
25|$|The United States (U.S.) <b>subprime</b> {{mortgage}} {{crisis was}} a nationwide banking emergency, occurring between 2007-2010, which {{contributed to the}} U.S. recession of December 2007 – June 2009.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, {{during the}} <b>subprime</b> {{mortgage}} crisis, the company sold an 80% interest in 11,000 properties for 40% of their previously-stated book value to Morgan Stanley.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 Swiss Finance Institute {{study of}} {{structured}} debt ratings from S, Moody's, and Fitch found that agencies provide better {{ratings for the}} structured products of issuers that provide them with more overall bilateral rating business. This effect {{was found to be}} particularly pronounced {{in the run-up to the}} <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis. Alternative accounts of the agencies' inaccurate ratings before the crisis downplay the conflict of interest factor and focus instead on the agencies' overconfidence in rating securities, which stemmed from faith in their methodologies and past successes with <b>subprime</b> securitizations.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the <b>subprime</b> {{mortgage}} crisis {{the bank}} {{was part of the}} FTSE 100 Index, but was demoted back to the FTSE 250 in December 2007. The shares were later delisted.|$|E
25|$|Exposed to risky loans, such as {{adjustable}} rate mortgages acquired {{during the}} acquisition of Golden West Financial in 2006, Wachovia began to experience heavy losses in its loan portfolios during the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis.|$|E
25|$|In a February 23, 2004 speech, Greenspan {{suggested}} that more homeowners should consider taking out adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) where {{the interest rate}} adjusts itself to the current interest in the market. The Fed's own funds rate was at a then all-time-low of 1%. A few months after his recommendation, Greenspan began raising interest rates, {{in a series of}} rate hikes that would bring the funds rate to 5.25% about two years later. A triggering factor in the 2007 <b>subprime</b> mortgage financial crisis {{is believed to be the}} many <b>subprime</b> ARMs that reset at much higher interest rates than what the borrower paid during the first few years of the mortgage.|$|E
25|$|From 2004 to 2006, {{he served}} on the board of {{directors}} of ACC Capital Holdings, the parent company of Ameriquest and Argent Mortgage. Ameriquest was the largest lender of so-called <b>subprime</b> mortgages and was under investigation by Attorneys General across the country. Patrick joined the board at the request of Ameriquest's founder, Roland Arnall, who asked for his help managing the investigations and changing the company's culture. During his tenure on the board, Ameriquest and Argent originated over $80 billion in <b>subprime</b> mortgages, but those conducting the investigation said that at the time Patrick left Ameriquest the company was on the road to change.|$|E
25|$|Barron held a {{mortgage}} crisis forum in 2007 to address concerns from residents {{who were in}} danger of house foreclosure. Barron said the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis of 2007 predominantly hurt African-Americans, who were lied to by predatory business practices.|$|E
25|$|Having {{a direct}} tie to Wall Street {{employment}} is problematic for New Jersey, however. The state lost 7.9 {{percent of its}} employment base from 2007 to 2010 in the financial services sector in the fallout of the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis.|$|E
25|$|Fannie Mae's charter has {{historically}} prevented it from guaranteeing mortgages with a loan-to-values over 80% without mortgage insurance or a repurchase {{agreement with the}} lender; however, in 2006 and 2007 Fannie Mae did purchase <b>subprime</b> and Alt-A loans as investments.|$|E
25|$|An article {{published}} in the San Francisco Chronicle likened the regulatory failures of the milk scandal to the distressed assets in the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis, and questioned whether regulators in either case ever understood or truly monitored {{the extent of the}} danger.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{believe that}} a taxpayer-funded government bailout related to mortgages during {{the savings and loan}} crisis may have created a moral hazard and acted as encouragement to lenders to make similar higher risk loans during the 2007 <b>subprime</b> mortgage financial crisis.|$|E
25|$|Low-quality mortgage-backed {{securities}} backed by <b>subprime</b> mortgages in the United States caused {{a crisis that}} {{played a major role}} in the 2007–12 global financial crisis. By 2012 the market for high-quality {{mortgage-backed securities}} had recovered and was a profit center for US banks.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} cope with the write-downs during the <b>subprime</b> {{mortgage}} crisis, Morgan Stanley announced on December 19, 2007 that it would receive a US$5billion capital infusion from the China Investment Corporation in exchange for securities that would be convertible to 9.9% of its shares in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the complexity inherent in securitization can limit investors' ability to monitor risk, and that competitive securitization markets with multiple securitizers may be particularly prone to sharp declines in underwriting standards. Private, competitive mortgage securitization {{played an important role in}} the U.S. <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 the Northern Rock {{bank was}} nationalised by the British Labour Government, due to {{financial}} {{problems caused by}} the <b>subprime</b> mortgage crisis.
