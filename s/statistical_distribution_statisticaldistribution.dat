30|$|The {{history of}} <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions</b> {{started in the}} 18 th century. The first major {{gathering}} on <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions</b> and their applications was in 1963 at McGill, Canada where experts participated in the International Symposium on Classical and Contagious Discrete Distributions. Another major gathering, the NATO Advanced Study Institute on <b>Statistical</b> <b>Distributions</b> in Scientific Work, {{was held at the}} University of Calgary, Canada from July 29 to August 10, 1974. Patil et al. (1974) in their preface to the Proceedings of the NATO Advanced Study Institute, referred to the McGill symposium as “a milestone in the recognition and development of the theory and application of statistical distributions.” According to Professor Kotz in his Foreword to the book by Consul and Famoye (2006) “The main impetus for the development of an orderly investigation of <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions</b> and their applications was the International Symposium on Classical and Contagious Discrete Distributions, organized by G.P. Patil in August of 1969 (1963) …” Since then, various conferences and meetings have been organized on <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions.</b> However, no dedicated journal on <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions</b> was ever launched.|$|R

It is noticed that the spatial variations of all the components of the planet Mercury are slow. The <b>statistical</b> <b>distribution</b> of the field magnitude of Mercury shows high tendency toward the lower values. Around % 0. 09 of Mercury's area have negative orientation in the north component. There is asymmetric behavior in the <b>statistical</b> <b>distribution</b> of all field components of Jupiter.

Our result shows {{that as long as}} the relation between the number operator and the creation and annihilation operators can be expressed as a^†b=Λ(N) or N=Λ^- 1 (a^†b), where N, a^†, and b denote the number, creation, and annihilation operators, i. e., N is a function of quadratic product of the creation and annihilation operators, the corresponding <b>statistical</b> <b>distribution</b> is the Gentile <b>distribution,</b> a <b>statistical</b> <b>distribution</b> in which the maximum occupation number is an arbitrary integer. As examples, we discuss the <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions</b> corresponding to various operator relations. In particular, besides Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac cases, we discuss the <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions</b> for various schemes of intermediate statistics, especially various q-deformation schemes. Our result shows that the <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions</b> corresponding to various q-deformation schemes are various Gentile distributions with different maximum occupation numbers which are determined by the deformation parameter q.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions</b> of light-ning current parameters {{based on}} the lightning current and current-derivative waveforms measured at the Säntis Tower site in 2010 and 2011. The total number of flashes analyzed {{in this study was}} 167, which includes nearly 2000 pulses. The <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions</b> refer to upward negative flashes. It is shown that negative flashes are mainly concentrated in the summer months during the convective season. Statistical data on the salient light-ning current parameters, namely, peak current, peak current derivative, risetime, pulse charge, pulse duration, interpulse interval, and flash multiplicity are presented and discussed. The obtained data that constitute the largest dataset available to this date for upward negative flashes are also compared with other available <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions.</b> Index Terms—Instrumented tower, lightning current, <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions,</b> upward flashes.

First, they have to find an appropriate <b>statistical</b> <b>distribution</b> for their large volumes of claim amounts. Then, test how well this <b>statistical</b> <b>distribution</b> fits their claim data. Most data in general insurance problems is skewed to the right and therefore most distributions that exhibit this characteristic can be used to model the claim severity.

30|$|<b>Statistical</b> <b>distributions</b> are the {{foundations}} of statistical methodology in both theory and applications. They are the back bone of every parametric statistical method, including inference, modeling, survival, reliability, and others. In recent years, {{partly due to the}} advanced computing technology, there have been a series of developments of new methodology for generating new families of <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions,</b> which have greatly enhanced parametric statistical methods for handling real world scenarios that could not be modeled using existing distributions. One main reason for the need of generalized families is that each of the useful basic <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions</b> has its own weakness in real-world applications. The real-world phenomena are often much more complex for these commonly known basic <b>statistical</b> <b>distributions</b> to provide adequate fit. For example, Johnson et al. (2005) presented various modifications and generalizations of the Poisson distribution. Some of these distributions were developed in an attempt to explain the unequal mean and variance in the numerical data observed in different fields of applications.|$|R
