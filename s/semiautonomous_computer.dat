The excavation task can be performing successfully and effectively for above mentioned working conditions by <b>semiautonomous</b> or fully <b>computer</b> controlled of excavation machines. For this it is important to understand the kinematics of this machine. For autonomous excavation operation of a backhoe, it is desirable to place the bucket to a specified location. The bucket configuration can be determined by the direct kinematic equations for given lengths of the piston rods in the actuators or the joint angles. This paper emphasize on the explicit expressions for the direct (forward) kinematics of backhoe excavator. It covers systematic procedure to assign Cartesian coordinate frames for the links (joints) of an excavator. The developed forward kinematic model is intended for development of an automated excavation control system for light duty construction work and can be applied for heavy duty or all types of backhoe excavators...|$|R
