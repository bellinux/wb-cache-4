Theoretically, a bandwidth-limited signal can be perfectly reconstructed if sampled at the Nyquist rate or above it. The Nyquist rate is defined as twice the highest frequency component in the <b>signal.</b> <b>Oversampling</b> improves resolution, reduces noise and helps avoid aliasing and phase distortion by relaxing anti-aliasing filter performance requirements.|$|E

The control structure is specified in a digital hardware description language, synthesized, and deployed on a field-programmable gate array chip. By updating, with negligible computation delay, the duty cycle twice in a switching period, the reference current error is nulled in half a modulation period, so that the controller’s small-signal bandwidth is maximized. In addition, due to a simple transient detection circuit, the large-signal response delay is reduced to {{a small fraction of}} the modulation period, which is determined by the chosen current <b>signal</b> <b>oversampling</b> rate. The controller can effectively support different voltage-source inverter applications, such as active filters, uninterruptible power supplies, microgrid distributed energy resource controllers, and dc–dc converter applications, including interface converters for renewable energy sources, laboratory battery chargers, and electronic welding machines...|$|E

The IO approach uses a continuous wave (CW) distributed feedback (DFB) laser diode at a peak wavelength of 1550 nm to oversample two Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs). The MZIs are part of sigma-delta modulator-based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) oversampling architecture. A ring resonator accumulator is embedded within a feedback loop in the modulator to spectrally shape the quantization noise of the system. The experimental and simulation results are evaluated as a narrow-band proof of concept {{for the use of}} photonics technology in the sampling of wide-band radio frequency (RF) signals. Taking the characteristics of the real components and the experimental results, a pulse to pulse computer simulation of an oversampled first-order single-bit sigma-delta modulator was accomplished using RSoft OptSim. The performance characteristics of this subsystem were compared with the narrow-band results produced in the laboratory. In addition, a comparator processor circuit for the <b>signal</b> <b>oversampling</b> subsystem was designed and simulated in SIMUCAD SmartSpice. The analysis of the comparator processor circuit was evaluated. The lack of high-speed components limited the experimental and simulation results. With the system integrated with high-speed components, a wide-band direct digital antenna architecture can be demonstrated. Department of Defense author (civilian) ...|$|E
40|$|Multirate {{systems are}} {{building}} blocks {{commonly used in}} digital signal processing (DSP). Their function is to alter {{the rate of the}} discrete-time signals, by adding or deleting a portion of the signal samples. They are essential in various standard signal processing techniques such as signal analysis, denoising, compression and so forth. During the last decade, however, they have increasingly found applications in new and emerging areas of signal processing, as well as in several neighboring disciplines such as digital communications. The main contribution of this thesis is aimed towards a better understanding of multirate systems and their use in modern communication systems. To this end, we first study a property of linear systems appearing in certain multirate structures. This property is called biorthogonal partnership and represents a terminology introduced recently to address a need for a descriptive term for such class of filters. In the thesis we especially focus on the extensions of this simple idea to the case of vector signals (MIMO biorthogonal partners) and to accommodate for nonintegral decimation ratios (fractional biorthogonal partners). The main results developed here study the properties of biorthogonal partners, e. g., the conditions for the existence of stable and of finite impulse response (FIR) partners. In this context we develop the parameterization of FIR solutions, which makes the search for the best partner in a given application analytically tractable. This proves very useful in their central application, namely, channel equalization in digital communications with <b>signal</b> <b>oversampling</b> at the receiver. A good channel equalizer in this context is one that helps neutralize the distortion on the signal introduced by the channel propagation but not at the expense of amplifying the channel noise. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, we focus on another class of multirate systems, used at the transmitter side in order to introduce redundancy in the data stream. This redundancy generally serves to facilitate the equalization process by forcing certain structure on the transmitted signal. We first consider the transmission systems that introduce the redundancy in the form of a cyclic prefix. The examples of such systems include the discrete multitone (DMT) and the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We study the signal precoding in such systems, aimed at improving the performance by minimizing the noise power at the receiver. We also consider a different class of communication systems with signal redundancy, namely, the multiuser systems based on code division multiple access (CDMA). We specifically focus on the special class of CDMA systems called `a mutually orthogonal usercode receiver' (AMOUR). We show how to find the best equalizer from the class of zero-forcing solutions in such systems, and then increase the size of this class by employing alternative sampling strategies at the receiver...|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{estimation}} of spectral moments on pulsed weather radars is presented. This scheme operates on oversampled echoes in range; that is, samples of in-phase and quadrature-phase components are collected {{at a rate}} several {{times larger than the}} reciprocal of the transmitted pulse length. The spectral moments are estimated by suitably combining weighted averages of these <b>oversampled</b> <b>signals</b> in range with usual processing of samples (spaced at the pulse repetition time) at a fixed range location. The weights in range are derived from a whitening transformation; hence, the <b>oversampled</b> <b>signals</b> become uncorrelated and, consequently, the variance of the estimates decreases significantly. Because the estimate errors are inversely proportional to the volume scanning times, it follows that storms can be surveyed much faster than is possible with current processing methods, or equivalently, for the current volume scanning time, accuracy of the estimates can be greatly improved. This significant improvement is achievable at large signal-to-noise ratios. 1...|$|R
