40|$|Abstract—Image {{formation}} from squinted sliding spotlight {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) is limited by azimuth <b>spectral</b> <b>folding</b> and severe two dimension coupling. This paper presents an Extended Wavenumber Domain Algorithm (WDA) for highly squinted sliding spotlight SAR data processing. This algorithm adopts azimuth deramping approach to overcome the azimuth <b>spectral</b> <b>folding</b> phenomenon. The chirp rate for azimuth deramping and the principle of choosing pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is presented to accommodate the characteristic of Doppler history. Subsequently, the full focusing is implemented by WDA. Instead of the conventional Stolt mapping in WDA, a modified Stolt mapping is introduced in order to enlarge the range extension of focused image and enable to update the Doppler parameters along range. To confirm the correctness of the implementation of modified Stolt mapping and the azimuth position of target in focused image, related compensation terms are developed. Point target simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of extended WDA to process highly squinted sliding spotlight SAR data. 1...|$|E

This paper aims to obtain well focused images using sliding spotlight mode with the Chinese Gaofen- 3 SAR sensor. We proposed an integrated imaging scheme with sliding spotlight echoes. In the imaging scheme, the two-step approach {{is applied to}} the spaceborne sliding spotlight SAR imaging algorithm, followed by the Doppler parameter estimation algorithm. The azimuth <b>spectral</b> <b>folding</b> phenomenon is overcome by the two-step approach. The results demonstrate a high Doppler parameter estimation accuracy.

Artificial Bandwidth Extension (ABE) based on <b>spectral</b> <b>folding</b> and spectral envelope estimation {{has been applied to}} compressed narrowband speech to test if an improvement in SER can be achieved. The modelling and classification of speech was performed with a benchmark approach based on the GMM classifier and a set of speech acoustic parameters including MFCCs, TEO and glottal parameters. The tests used the Berlin Emotional Speech data base. In general, ABE led to an improvement of SER accuracy; however the amount of improvement varied between different features, genders, and speech compression rates. In all cases, SER accuracy with ABE was at least 10 % lower than for uncompressed speech...|$|E

40|$|As {{a widely}} used {{approach}} for feature extraction and data reduction, Principal Components Analysis (PCA) suffers from high computational cost, large memory requirement and low efficacy {{in dealing with}} large dimensional datasets such as Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI). Consequently, a novel Folded-PCA is proposed, where the <b>spectral</b> vector is <b>folded</b> into a matrix to allow the covariance matrix to be determined more efficiently. With this matrix-based representation, both global and local structures are extracted to provide additional information for data classification. Moreover, both the computational cost and the memory requirement have been significantly reduced. Using Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification on two well-known HSI datasets and one Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) dataset in remote sensing, quantitative results are generated for objective evaluations. Comprehensive results have indicated that the proposed Folded-PCA approach not only outperforms the conventional PCA but also the baseline approach where the whole feature sets are used...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a Spectral Band Replication (SBR) tool for low delay audio {{applications}} is presented. One {{goal of this}} enhancement tool {{is to reduce the}} needed bit rate for the representation of audio data using an arbitrary audio codec. Another goal is to keep the algorithmic delay as low as possible. A low coding delay is essential for instance for real time applications like distributed music production under live conditions or telephone conferencing. The low delay SBR approach proposed in this paper uses techniques developed for speech coding purposes and is associated with artificial bandwidth extension methods, particularly <b>spectral</b> <b>folding.</b> Further, the tool exclusively operates in the time domain using prediction methods and adaptive filters in order to avoid additional delay which can be caused by using a filter bank...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this work}} we propose the {{construction}} of twochannel wavelet filterbanks for analyzing functions defined on the vertices of any arbitrary finite weighted undirected graph. These graph based functions {{are referred to as}} graph-signals as we build a framework in which many concepts from the classical signal processing domain, such as Fourier decomposition, signal filtering and downsampling can be extended to graph domain. Especially, we observe a <b>spectral</b> <b>folding</b> phenomenon in bipartite graphs which occurs during downsampling of these graphs and produces aliasing in graph signals. This property of bipartite graphs, allows us to design critically sampled twochannel filterbanks, and we propose quadrature mirror filters (referred to as graph-QMF) for bipartite graph which cancel aliasing and lead to perfect reconstruction. For arbitrary graphs we present a bipartite subgraph decomposition which produces an edge-disjoint collection of bipartite subgraphs. Graph-QMFs are then constructed on each bipartite subgraph leading to “multi-dimensional ” separable wavelet filterbanks on graphs. Our proposed filterbanks are critically sampled and we state necessary and sufficient conditions for orthogonality, aliasing cancellation and perfect reconstruction. The filterbanks are realized by Chebychev polynomial approximations. Note: Code examples from this paper are available a...|$|E

40|$|Mini-myoglobin, {{obtained}} by limited proteolysis of horse heart myoglobin (residues 32 to 139), represents a good model for testing {{the correlation between}} an exon and a protein domain. We have shown that ligand binding kinetics, <b>spectral</b> and <b>folding</b> features of mini-myoglobin {{are very similar to}} those of native myoglobin. In order to develop further the analysis of the structure-function relationship in this mini-protein, mini-globin was reconstituted with the heme moiety in which iron is replaced by cobalt. The Soret absorption spectra of oxy and deoxy cobaltous mini-myoglobin are very similar to those of cobaltous myoglobin derivatives; in addition. Co-mini-myoglobin binds oxygen reversibly with an n value approximately 1 and a p 50 value of 45 to 50 mm Hg (the same as Co-myoglobin). Oxy Co-mini-myoglobin shows a well-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (e. p. r.) spectrum typical of an oxygenated hemoprotein, while the spectrum of the deoxy derivative, although similar to that of deoxy Co-myoglobin, displays a lower resolution of the complex hyperfine structure. Moreover, photodissociation experiments on oxy Co-mini-myoglobin allow e. p. r. detection of an intermediate state, already observed in most hemoproteins and diagnostic for the interaction of bound oxygen with the distal histidine residue. Thus, reconstitution of mini-globin with cobalt protoprophyrin IX has provided, for the first time, a stable oxygenated complex that reflects a correct folding of the protein surrounding the heme pocket and possesses the functional behaviour typical of a hemoprotein...|$|R
40|$|Short Gamma-Ray Bursts {{have been}} {{identified}} as a separate class of events with distinct spectral and temporal properties from their long (> 2 seconds) counterparts. Although multi-wavelength transients and their host galaxies had been found for the latter, it was only after the launch of the Swift satellite that short GRB counterparts and hosts were discovered and studied in detail. Currently, over a dozen short events have been detected with less than half having a measured redshift. Since 199 1, GRB durations were established using BATSE gamma-ray light-curves; it is becoming, however, gradually evident from the Swift/BAT data, that we now need to <b>fold</b> <b>spectral</b> dependence, in particular prompt gamma-ray emission spectral time lags, into a multi-parameter GRB classification scheme. I will discuss here the properties of the prompt gamma-rays of all Swift short GRBs, compare them to those detected with BATSE and other missions and comment on the implications of the different subclass population each mission is probing...|$|R
40|$|Although the Raman {{effect is}} nearly two orders of {{magnitude}} stronger than the electronic Kerr nonlinearity in silicon, under pulsed operation regime where the pulse width is shorter than the phonon response time, Raman effect is suppressed and Kerr nonlinearity dominates. Continuum generation, {{made possible by the}} non-resonant Kerr nonlinearity, offers a technologically and economically appealing path to WDM communication at the inter-chip or intrachip levels. We have studied this phenomenon experimentally and theoretically. Experimentally, a 2 <b>fold</b> <b>spectral</b> broadening is obtained by launching ~ 4 ps optical pulses with 2. 2 GW/cm 2 peak power into a conventional silicon waveguide. Theoretical calculations, that include the effect of two-photon-absorption, free carrier absorption and refractive index change indicate that up to> 30 times spectral broadening is achievable in an optimized device. The broadening is due to self phase modulation and saturates due to two photon absorption. Additionally, we find that free carrier dynamics also contributes to the spectral broadening and cause the overall spectrum to be asymmetric with respect to the pump wavelength. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{provides}} a tutorial overview of multichannel wireless digital receivers and {{the relationships between}} channel bandwidth, channel separation, and channel sample rate. The overview makes liberal use of figures to support the underlying mathematics. A multichannel digital receiver simultaneously down-convert a set of frequency-division-multiplexed (FDM) channels residing in a single sampled data signal stream. In a similar way, a multichannel digital transmitter simultaneously up-converts a number of baseband signals to assemble a set of FDM channels in a single sampled data signal stream. The polyphase filter bank has become the architecture of choice to efficiently accomplish these tasks. This architecture uses three interacting processes to assemble or to disassemble the channelized signal set. In a receiver, these processes are an input commutator to effect <b>spectral</b> <b>folding</b> or aliasing due {{to a reduction in}} sample rate, a polyphase-path filter to time align the partitioned and resampled time series in each path, and a discrete Fourier transform to phase align and separate the multiple baseband aliases. In a transmitter, these same processes operate in a related manner to alias baseband signals to high order Nyquist zones while increasing the sample rate with the output commutator. This paper presents a sequence of simple modifications to sampled data structures based on analog prototype systems to obtain the basic polyphase structure. We further discuss ways to incorporate small modifications in the operation of the polyphase system to accommodate secondary performance requirements. MATLAB simulations of a 10 -, 40 -, and 50 -channel resampling receiver are included in the electronic version of this paper. An animated version of the ten-channel resampling receiver illustrates the time and frequency response of the filter bank when driven by a slowly varying linear FM sweep.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{an important}} research gap regarding effects of real-life conditions including coded, narrow-band and noisy speech signals on automatic emotion recognition (AER) from speech signals. In addition, the study aims to research efficient methods of reducing possible detrimental effects of speech signals compression on AER. The thesis {{consists of two}} parts. The first part investigates the effects of noise, data compression and bandwidth reduction on AER from speech signals. The second part investigates application of AER based on speech spectrograms (SS) and the Artificial Bandwidth Extension (ABE) to improve the robustness and accuracy of emotion recognition from speech signals under these potentially undesirable conditions. Effects of adaptive multi-rates (AMR), adaptive multi-rate wideband (AMR-WB) and extended adaptive multi-rate wideband (AMR-WB+) and MP 3 speech compression methods are compared against emotion recognition from uncompressed speech. Noisy conditions are simulated using Gaussian white noise added to speech signals at different values of {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR). Band reduction is tested using speech filtering. The AER methods include techniques based on acoustic speech parameters including: mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), Teager energy operator and perceptual wavelet packet (TEO-PWP) features, glottal time and frequency domain features (GP-T&amp;GP-F), as well as, spectrogram image (SS) parameters, spectrogram critical band scale (SS-CB) and spectrogram bark scale (SS-Bark). The modelling of acoustic classes is based on the Gaussian Mixture Mode (GMM) and all experiments use the same Berlin Emotional Speech database. The ABE of narrow band speech is performed using <b>spectral</b> <b>folding</b> and spectral envelope estimation methods. The major findings described in this thesis indicate that: 1. Standard speech compression methods such as AMR, AMR-WB, AMR-WB+ and MP 3 {{have a significant effect on}} the (AER), and in general lead to significant degradation of AER accuracy. 2. Low-frequency components (0 kHz to 1 kHz) of speech containing the fundamental frequency information, as well as, high-frequency components (above 4 kHz) have a key effect on the accuracy of SER. 3. Significant reduction of AER accuracy was observed for uncompressed speech modified in a way simulating a typical mild-to-moderate high frequency hearing loss. This accuracy was further reduced when the modified speech was compressed. 4. Addition of noise to either uncompressed or compressed speech reduces accuracy of AER. It was shown that the best performing under noisy conditions features were MFCCs and the best performing speech compression algorithms was AMR-WB. 5. Detrimental effects of speech compression can be mitigated using AER based on speech spectrogram features. 6. By extending the narrow-band of AMR-compressed speech an improvement of AER accuracy can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|An {{asymptotic}} {{technique is}} presented for finding the spectral efficiency of multi-antenna links in wireless networks where transmitters have Channel-State-Information (CSI) corresponding to their target receiver. Transmitters {{are assumed to}} transmit independent data streams on {{a limited number of}} channel modes which limits the rank of transmit covariance matrices. This technique is applied to spatially distributed networks to derive an approximation for the asymptotic spectral efficiency in the interference-limited regime as a function of link-length, interferer density, number of antennas per receiver and transmitter, number of transmit streams and path-loss exponent. It is found that targeted-receiver CSI, which can be acquired with low overhead in duplex systems with reciprocity, can increase <b>spectral</b> efficiency several <b>fold,</b> particularly when link lengths are large, node density is high or both. Additionally, the per-link spectral efficiency is found to be a function of the ratio of node density to the number of receiver antennas, and that it can often be improved if nodes transmit using fewer streams. These results are validated for finite-sized systems by Monte-Carlo simulation and are asymptotic in the regime where the number of users and antennas per receiver approach infinity...|$|R
40|$|Rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) luminosities {{form the}} `backbone' of our {{understanding}} of star formation at all cosmic epochs. These luminosities are typically corrected for dust by assuming that the tight relationship between the UV spectral slopes and the FUV attenuations of starburst galaxies applies for all star-forming galaxies. Data from seven independent UV experiments demonstrates that quiescent, `normal' star-forming galaxies deviate substantially from the starburst galaxy spectral slope-attenuation correlation, {{in the sense that}} normal galaxies are redder than starbursts. Spatially resolved data for the Large Magellanic Cloud suggests that dust geometry and properties, coupled with a small contribution from older stellar populations, cause deviations from the starburst galaxy <b>spectral</b> slope-attenuation correlation. <b>Folding</b> in data for starbursts and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, it is clear that neither rest-frame UV-optical colors nor UV/H-alpha significantly help in constraining the UV attenuation. These results argue that the estimation of SF rates from rest-frame UV and optical data alone is subject to large (factors of at least a few) systematic uncertainties because of dust, which cannot be reliably corrected for using only UV/optical diagnostics.

40|$|The space {{radiation}} {{environment is}} composed of energetic particles which can deliver harmful doses of radiation {{that may lead to}} acute radiation sickness, cancer, and even death for insufficiently shielded crew members. Spacecraft shielding must provide structural integrity and minimize the risk associated with radiation exposure. The risk of radiation exposure induced death (REID) {{is a measure of the}} risk of dying from cancer induced by radiation exposure. Uncertainties in the risk projection model, quality factor, and <b>spectral</b> fluence are <b>folded</b> into the calculation of the REID by sampling from probability distribution functions. Consequently, determining optimal shielding materials that reduce the REID in a statistically significant manner has been found to be difficult. In this work, the difference of the REID distributions for different materials is used to study the effect of composition on shielding effectiveness. It is shown that the use of correlated uncertainties allows for the determination of statistically significant differences between materials despite the large uncertainties in the quality factor. This is in contrast to previous methods where uncertainties have been generally treated as uncorrelated. It is concluded that the use of correlated quality factor uncertainties greatly reduces the uncertainty in the assessment of shielding effectiveness for the mitigation of radiation exposure...|$|R
