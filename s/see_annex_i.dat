30|$|Assessing the {{exposure}} of lepidopteran larvae to Bt maize pollen means that acceptability thresholds are defined at {{the exposure}} {{rather than at the}} effect or risk level. Similarly, in the regulation of ambient air pollutants, acceptability thresholds for adverse effects are defined either based on emission values or atmospheric input values [142, 143]. For example, critical loads of air pollutants are set as ecological limits for the input of atmospheric pollutants into a particular ecosystem. No adverse effects on the ecosystem are expected as long as the critical load is not exceeded (<b>see</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> of Gothenburg-Protocol and [142]). Exposure levels are defined as “critical levels” when they exceed levels above which adverse effects may occur on certain environmental receptors, such as trees, other plants or natural ecosystems [143]. Importantly, recommendations for critical load and critical level values for ambient air quality are based on well-established scientific knowledge such as physiological and ecological effects of nitrogen-containing pollutants on the most sensitive type of vegetation or ecosystem [144]. Hence, LoCs for Bt maize could also be set as exposure-based acceptability thresholds if Bt maize pollen is used as an exposure-based indicator.|$|E

40|$|The basic {{principle}} underlying the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) is that sensitizers induce proliferation of lymphocytes in {{the lymph nodes}} draining the site of substance application. Under appropriate test conditions, this proliferation {{is proportional to the}} dose applied, and provides a means of obtaining an objective, quantitative measurement of sensitization. The test measures cell proliferation as a function of in vivo radioisotope (3 H-methyl thymidine or 125 I-iododeoxyuridine) incorporation into the DNA of dividing lymphocytes, and assesses this proliferation in the draining lymph nodes proximal to the application site (<b>see</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>I).</b> Due to the use of radioactivity, the LLNA has limited use in regions where the acquisition, use, or disposal of radioactivity is problematic. The LLNA: BrdU-ELISA was therefore developed as a nonradioactive modification to the LLNA (Takeyoshi 2001), which uses nonradiolabelled 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) (Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number [CASRN] 59 - 14 - 3) with detection by an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to assess lymphocyte proliferation. The ability to detect skin sensitizers without the necessity of using a radioactive label for DNA eliminates the potential for occupational exposure to radioactivity and waste disposal issues. Similar to the LLNA, the LLNA: BrdU-ELISA studies the induction phase of skin sensitization and provides quantitative dat...|$|E

40|$|A major {{limitation}} {{on the use}} of wind turbines in Europe is their noise radiation. The amount of wind energy generation capacity that can be installed at a site is directly dependent on the noise radiated. A noise reduction in the order of only 2 dB(A) can increase the number of installations by about 50 %. The tip noise experiments on commercial wind turbines have confirmed the results obtained in the wind tunnel. Tip designs generating strong tip vortices (e. g. extreme curvature at the leading edge) interacting with the TE (trailing edge longer than the leading edge) cause additional noise in the high frequency range (a second maximum in the 2 kHz frequency range of the sound power spectra is an indication of tip noise). Reductions of the overall sound power level up to 4 dB(A) can be reached by designs avoiding these effects (<b>see</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> and III). The measurements in the open and in the wind tunnel showed that the tip noise radiation is very sensitive to the angle of attack. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} following design criteria should be followed: - Cutting away of the trailing edge - modest leading edge sweep - reduction of the angle of attack at the tip.

40|$|This {{deliverable}} (9. 8) is {{an article}} {{submitted to the}} International Journal of Law, Policy and the Family (Oxford Journals) which analyses the notion of family in the EU and family reproductive rights {{in a group of}} EU member states with different legal, cultural and social backgrounds (Italy, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands, Croatia and Hungary). The article combines a sociological and legal approach and is based on a questionnaire completed by the partners involved in the task (<b>see</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>I).</b> The social and legal changes in the geographies of families in Member States encourage the European Union to reconsider its traditionally prudent approach to family law. Indeed, the free movement of people, an essential characteristic of European citizenship, requires legally established family statuses to be ‘portable’ abroad. Similarly, marriage and reproductive mobility arising from the variety of national regulations force domestic legislatures and courts to challenge the definitions of family found in domestic law and social policy {{in the name of the}} right to family life and the principle of non-discrimination. Thus, this article starts by discussing the various notions of family that emerge from national laws and social policies in six EU member states with different legal, cultural and social backgrounds (Italy, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands, Croatia and Hungary). It then delineates the role of Europe and the social and legal interactions between Member States in the construction of a definition of family. Finally, it concentrates on cross-border reproductive care, a case study that allows for shedding light on the convergences among countries, as well as the role of Europe as a supra-national institution and as a space in which family models circulate and spread. The main conclusion is that a multilevel analysis of the notion of family shows the circularity of interactions top-down and bottom-up between Europe and individual States, as well between society and law...|$|E
40|$|On 8 and 9 December 2015, The Hague Institute for Global Justice, in {{collaboration}} with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, organized both a public high-level discussion and a closed expert consultation on the EU’s forthcoming Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy. The events focused on how the Union and its Member States can promote a rules-based international system and effective multilateral institutions in a rapidly changing environment marked by numerous crises and challenges. The high-level discussion on the morning of 8 December featured keynote addresses from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Bert Koenders, and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini. The high-level discussion also served as a prelude to the subsequent expert consultation, which was carried out according to the following methodology. The participants in the consultation were selected from among leading experts in EU foreign policy, global governance, European and international law, and multilateral diplomacy. Reflecting a diverse and representative set of stakeholders and professional perspectives, the experts came from think tanks, academia, international organizations, NGOs, and the private sector. Particular attention was paid to ensuring gender balance and including external perspectives from emerging powers and key partners of the EU, such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Nigeria. In the course of several breakout sessions and plenary discussions, the participants elaborated on the themes of: the EU’s role in developing the international legal order, promoting effective multilateral institutions, and engaging non-state actors in tackling the most pressing global challenges (<b>see</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>I</b> for the program).
