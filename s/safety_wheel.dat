50|$|Chrysler also {{developed}} a road wheel with a ridged rim, designed to keep a deflated tire from flying off the wheel. This <b>safety</b> <b>wheel</b> was eventually adopted by the auto industry worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the opening, on 16 August 2002 an {{accident}} occurred during a test run involving a 13.4 kg <b>safety</b> <b>wheel</b> falling off a train {{and hitting the}} head of a pedestrian walking under the monorail viaduct at Jalan Sultan Ismail. The victim, David Cheliah, a journalist, suffered injuries that required hospitalisation.|$|E
50|$|The fitting {{procedure}} is relatively troublesome and not popular with tyre fitters. This {{may be one}} reason that this design of wheel has not been widely adopted, meaning that modern cars are still prone to tyre detachment, though tyre safety itself has improved dramatically in the last 30 years. The Avon <b>Safety</b> <b>Wheel</b> was first used on the 1974 Vauxhall Firenza.|$|E
50|$|Wheels are lockable. For <b>safety,</b> <b>wheels</b> can {{be locked}} when {{transferring}} {{the patient in}} or out of the bed.|$|R
50|$|Safety came to {{the fore}} in 1967, and the Catalina {{featured}} all the new US Government-mandated safety equipment including an energy-absorbing steering column, <b>safety</b> steering <b>wheel,</b> dual-circuit hydraulic brake system, and soft interior parts.|$|R
50|$|Sheller {{began in}} 1916 as a wood rim {{steering}} wheel manufacturer in Portland, Indiana. In 1958, Sheller had produced the first recessed <b>safety</b> steering <b>wheel</b> and padded dash safety package offered by Ford Motor Company.|$|R
50|$|The Avon <b>Safety</b> <b>Wheel</b> was a {{new type}} of wheel for cars, invented by the Avon Tyre Company of Britain in the early 1970s. With the advent of radial tyres, taking over from the older crossply type, it was found that {{in the event of a}} {{puncture}} or blowout, the tyre would be much more prone to detach from the rim, which would make a bad situation somewhat worse.|$|E
50|$|The VE Valiant {{was larger}} than any {{previous}} Valiant model. Styling was based on that of the US Dodge Dart and Plymouth Valiant models with no body panels carried over from the VC Valiant. Also new in the VE range were dual-line brakes, double-sided <b>safety</b> <b>wheel</b> rims, front safety belts and power-assisted front disc brakes on V8 models. The Valiant VIP was offered for the first time, the new model featuring the V8 engine, automatic transmission, power steering, front disc brakes and reclining front seats.|$|E
50|$|The Avon <b>Safety</b> <b>Wheel</b> {{avoids the}} {{detachment}} of a deflated tyre {{by having a}} much shallower central recess within {{the interior of the}} wheel. The recess is so shallow that the tyre is prevented from twisting to an angle that would allow it to slip {{over the edge of the}} rim, so it is retained. Such a shallow recess would also prevent the fitment of new tyres, if it weren't for the inclusion of a deep channel, allowing the bead of the tyre to enter the channel to permit fitting. The channel is covered by a metal band that is tightened around the wheel after the tyre is fitted but before it is inflated.|$|E

40|$|The wide {{spreading}} of new technical {{solutions for}} light rail vehicles (e. g. modular architectures, independent wheels and articulated bogie frames) {{leads to the}} need for a dedicated tool for the analyses of the related technical issues, such as running <b>safety,</b> <b>wheels</b> and rails wear, maintenance, radiated vibration and noise. In the last ten years, Politecnico di Milano has developed a multibody model designed for reproducing the dynamic behaviour of articulated urban rail vehicles. In this paper, after {{a brief description of the}} multibody model and of its main features, some meaningful results are reported, in order to point out the capabilities of the developed model for the analysis of vehicle running safety on curved track. In particular, two different vehicles are considered and their running safety is analysed with reference to the response to track geometrical defects and to roll-over risk...|$|R
50|$|Like all cars {{sold in the}} U.S. for 1967, the 4-4-2 came {{standard}} with a {{group of}} occupant protection and accident avoidance features as mandated by Federal law. This safety package included an energy-absorbing steering column and <b>safety</b> steering <b>wheel,</b> padded dash, recessed controls, four-way hazard flashers and a dual-circuit brake hydraulic master cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|On 7 March 2003, Cheliah filed a MYR 5 million {{negligence}} {{suit against}} the companies involved in the design, installation and operation of the trains, {{as well as the}} Director-General of Railways. On 8 April 2009, the High Court ruled that the Monorail company was liable for the incident, but not the Director-General of Railways. Although the monorail company reported that any such accident was [...] "unlikely" [...] as six bolts would have to be removed for it to occur and furthermore, a check of all 23 other safety wheels on the train involved did not turn up any other issues, the high court judgement ruled that the monorail company [...] "failed to provide a reasonable explanation as to how the <b>safety</b> <b>wheel</b> had come off the train and instead relied on the possibility that there had been tampering by unknown persons".|$|E
30|$|As coupler {{force and}} brake shoe {{pressure}} from the 1 D train model are added, the 3 D train model with detailed modeling can solve lateral and vertical problem of a heavy haul train. In this study, the simulation results focus on the derailment <b>safety,</b> <b>wheel</b> wear power, and traction ratio.|$|E
40|$|One of the key-elements of train {{design is}} the {{wheelset}} lifetime, which is strongly {{dependent on the}} levels of wheel wear. In order to reduce costs and increase <b>safety,</b> <b>wheel</b> wear needs to be predicted with increasing precision. In the past few years specific tools have been introduced to combine the predicted dynamic data from multi-body models, with the analytical computation of the wheel-rail contact parameters, to achieve an improved wear prediction. The aim of the present work is to consider the different methodologies for wear prediction and to create a wear prediction tool which is based on available railway dynamics codes enhanced by improved rolling contact analysis, combined with recent research on wear...|$|E

60|$|The Turks at {{this point}} {{executed}} a flank movement, and attempted to take the hill by storm. At the same time one of their batteries appeared {{on the top of}} a ridge opposite, and began to play on the hill with terrible precision. To counteract this a Russian battery of three guns was despatched. I saw the horses come galloping in from the rear; one of the guns was limbered up, and off they went like the wind. At that moment a shell from the Turkish battery fell right under the gun, and, exploding, blew it, with the men and horses, into the air. The other guns reached the hill in <b>safety,</b> <b>wheeled</b> into position, and, for a time, checked the Turkish fire. Nevertheless, undeterred by the withering salvos, the Turks came on in powerful columns till they drew near to the hotly contested point.|$|R
50|$|By late August 1889, Van Wagoner {{participated in}} a bicycle race in New Hartford, Connecticut, where he rode in both the 5 mi lap and the 1 mi tandem safety handicap.

40|$|The called {{vibratory}} instability squeal {{that appears}} in narrow curve or in end of braking is today uncontrolled and produced a high pitched noise very intense and unbearable. Many systems {{have been developed to}} limit acoustic emissions and particularly the metallic ring damping solution. Attenuation can reach 20 dB depending on the wheel type (Corail, <b>safety</b> <b>wheel,</b> etc.). However, the question is why this system has a various efficiency even on similar wheels and if this solution may be optimized. The aim {{of this paper is to}} understand the attenuation mechanisms of the ring dampers. Wheel modes susceptible to squeal are highlighted and numerical models are developed in order to simulate how the acoustic attenuation occur...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design and develop a glide control {{mechanism}} for a middle aged client with autism at the Monson Developmental Center. The client enjoyed propelling himself backward in his wheelchair which could often pose a safety hazard if he ran into objects or into other people. The development of an attachable glide control mechanism would prevent the wheelchair from excessive gliding while still maintaining its freedom of motion. The design team first created a list of preliminary design concepts that would all {{reduce the amount of}} glide when attached to the wheelchair. These concepts included bicycle brake calipers, a friction clutch, a friction belt, a “Wheel of Fortune” friction device, a dragging brake, an electromagnetic device, a piston device, and a rotating brake. Lists of advantages and disadvantages were created for each device, and then each design was rated based on a priority matrix. After further analysis of cost and feasibility, the friction belt was chosen for development into a prototype. This design would include two belts which press against two hubs that are attached to the wheels of the wheelchair. The tension that this setup creates results in a greater frictional force between the belt and the hub, decreasing the ability of the wheels to rotate freely. The device was developed and tested for maneuverability, glide limitation, <b>safety,</b> <b>wheel</b> balance, and accessibility to the client. The device was then tested by the client and {{it was found that the}} glide control mechanism appropriately limited the speed that the wheelchair was able to reach, without inhibiting the mobility of the wheelchair...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays urban {{vehicles}} {{have become}} more and more important in public transportation, this have lead to the development of new generations tramcars with structural configurations and design solutions (e. g. articulated bogie frames, independently rotating wheels) which can significantly improve comfort, capability and accessibility. Moreover the suburban tramways that are growing up, are often characterised by dedicated rights-of-way, equipped with Vignole rails. For these reasons a careful analysis of vehicle running safety is required, with particular respect of derailment risk, besides other topics such as riding comfort and vehicle stability and line maintenance. Maintenance of tramcar lines, actually, represents one of the major issue for urban transportation authorities. In fact, beyond their actual costs, maintenance activities may require intervention on the road yard, leading to a deep impact on urban mobility and what is more can deeply affect the comfort and the running stability of the vehicle. Thus it is important to point out the most important characteristics a line must have in terms of irregularity in order to guarantee the main running dynamics performances and safety. This work is aimed to provide an effective tool able to identify the influence of track degradation on the running <b>safety</b> (<b>wheel</b> climb) of a modern tramcar equipped with independently rotating wheels. By means of a dedicate multi-body model, tramcar dynamic behaviour in different running conditions (e. g. different curve radius, speed) can be investigated taking into account various track defects amplitude and shapes. In the paper, after {{a brief description of the}} mathematical model of the vehicle, with particular attention to the wheel/rail contact model (par. 2) as the methodology for the evaluation of the vehicle safety running behaviour (par. 3) and the obtained results are reported (par. 4) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Sports Hatch {{limited edition}} {{did not share}} the uprated 2279cc slant four engine with the HP Firenza Droop Snoot model, but instead was fitted with the {{standard}} tune single carb 2279cc slant four engine and running gear of the Magnum. Also included in the standard specification was the famous [...] "seven dial dash", Avon <b>Safety</b> <b>Wheels</b> and a distinctive paint finish in a then brand new Vauxhall [...] "Extra Dark Wine" [...] (only available otherwise on the brand new for 1976 VX 2300 GLS model) which was complemented with bright red striping and highlights. This model was always rare with 197 vehicles being completed and is now highly collectable. Vauxhall marketed this car as a [...] "hatchback", since it was coming under increasing pressure from new European models such as the Golf that were hatchbacks.

40|$|The essay as a genre in the {{tradition}} of Montaigne stages the inadequacies of attempts to grasp at objects and what connects us to them and them to us and us to each other, and then slings away the <b>safety</b> <b>wheels</b> by wondering: who we are anyway? But what happens to the essay in the age of &# 039;hyperobjects&# 039; (Morton 2013) like global warming? This essay examines how the anti-methodical techniques of the essay (personal, lyric) might be placed to respond to life in the Anthropocene, when the &# 039;I&# 039; of the essayist finds itself in increasingly uncharted waters, when &# 039;nature&# 039; itself, let alone &# 039;human nature&# 039;, begin to look like quaint conceptual knick-knacks, and when humans can no longer claim special ontological status over nonhumans. Philosophers, anthropologists, environmental humanists and other scholars are increasingly experimenting with modes of writing enmeshing scientific data and critical theory with affectively charged, embodied and intimate accounts. At the same time, essayists are rethinking the boundaries of the personal, and trying new ways to write from a standpoint rejecting human/nonhuman binaries. This essay seeks to draw connections across the disciplines, to invite further alliances between creative writers and fellow academics, as together we essay the Anthropocene with entangled nonfiction...|$|R
50|$|The {{other major}} {{features}} {{in which the}} Volvo 66 differs from the DAF 66 are also mostly safety related. It has different seats featuring headrests, a <b>safety</b> steering <b>wheel,</b> steel side-impact bars in the doors, a declutching servo which enabled the driver to change gear with the choke engaged (In the older DAF models this was not possible, because the increased idle caused the centrifugal clutch to engage). The Volvo 66 also has a 'park' mode in the CVT, which locks the driveline. From 1977 the estate version featured a window wiper on the bootlid.|$|R

5000|$|At that time, the {{original}} flat-fronted Firenza model was rebadged as the Magnum coupé, {{and the name}} Firenza was used exclusively for the HP version. This car was an exciting styling departure for Vauxhall, and certainly created something of a buzz. The engine was the 2.3-litre variant of the OHC Slant Four engine, uprated to a very torquey [...] {{using a variety of}} parts developed by Blydenstein Racing. It had twin 175 Stromberg carburettors, high-lift camshaft and free-flow tubular exhaust manifold. The car was restyled on the David Jones original by American designer Wayne Cherry and the result was an exceptionally low drag coefficient for its time. Suspension was uprated and lowered, brakes uprated, and a 5-speed ZF dog leg gearbox was installed, a much stronger unit than fitted to the standard model (though rather noisy). Another unusual feature of the car was the alloy Avon <b>Safety</b> <b>Wheels,</b> which were designed to retain the tyre safely {{in the event of a}} puncture. This was the first car to use these wheels in production. All production cars were painted in the same colour - Silver Starfire, and featured a largely black interior with silver-grey cloth seats. An unusual interior feature of dubious utility was the passenger grab handle on the dash in place of the standard glovebox.|$|R
50|$|As wheel motors {{brake and}} {{accelerate}} a vehicle {{with a single}} solid state electric/electronic system many of the above features can be added as software upgrades rather than requiring additional systems/hardware be installed like with ABS etc. This should lead to cheaper active dynamic <b>safety</b> systems for <b>wheel</b> motor equipped road vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The {{steering}} wheels were rigid and mounted on non-collapsible steering columns. This arrangement increased {{the risk of}} impaling the driver {{in case of a}} severe crash. The first collapsible steering column was invented in 1934 but was never successfully marketed. By 1956, Ford came out with a <b>safety</b> steering <b>wheel</b> that was set high above the post with spokes that would flex, but the column was still rigid. In 1968, United States regulations (FMVSS Standard No. 204) were implemented concerning the acceptable rearward movement of the steering wheel in case of crash. Collapsible steering columns were required to meet that standard.|$|R

In addition to high-grade interior appointments, the Corsair also received additional stainless steel trim and deluxe wheel covers. Available {{either as a}} two-door or four-door hardtop, the Corsair, like the premium Citation, shared its roof lines with Mercury models, as well as internal body components. Body parts between the Corsair and Citation models could not be shared with either the Ranger or Pacer, which were built on the shorter, narrower Ford frames.

25|$|The 1967 models {{received}} {{nothing more}} than a touch-up after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern that filled the deck lid trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked {{much in the way of}} trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and <b>safety</b> steering <b>wheel,</b> soft interior parts such as armrests and sun visors, recessed instrument panel knobs, and front shoulder belt anchors, were included in all 1967 models.|$|R
