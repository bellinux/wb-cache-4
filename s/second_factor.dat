For example, a vessel that will pass the Panama Canal will be limited in its beam and draft. For most designs, the ratio of length-to-width ranges between 5 and 7, with an average of 6.2. The ratio of length-to-height will be between 11 and 12.|$|E
5|$|A <b>second</b> <b>factor</b> which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of a semi-permanent high-pressure area known as the North Pacific High in the eastern Pacific is a dominant factor against formation of tropical cyclones in the winter, as the Pacific High results in wind shear that causes environmental conditions for tropical cyclone formation to be unconducive. Its effects in the central Pacific basin are usually related to keeping cyclones away from the Hawaiian Islands. Due to westward trade winds, hurricanes in the Pacific nearly never head eastward, although several storms have defied the odds and headed eastward. A <b>second</b> <b>factor</b> preventing tropical cyclones from forming during the winter is the occupation of a semi-permanent low-pressure area designated the Aleutian Low between January and April. Its presence over western Canada and the northwestern United States contributes to the area's occurrences of precipitation in that duration. In addition, its effects in the central Pacific near 160°W causes tropical waves that form {{in the area to}} drift northward into the Gulf of Alaska and dissipate. Its retreat in late-April allows the warmth of the Pacific High to meander in, bringing its powerful clockwise wind circulation with it. The Intertropical Convergence Zone departs southward in mid-May permitting the formation of the earliest tropical waves, coinciding with the start of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on May15.|$|E

5|$|The <b>second</b> <b>factor</b> is {{the value}} of protection: would the plant be less able to survive and {{reproduce}} after removal of part of its structure by a herbivore? Not all plant parts are of equal evolutionary value, thus valuable parts contain more defenses. A plant’s stage of development at the time of feeding also affects the resulting change in fitness. Experimentally, the fitness value of a plant structure is determined by removing that part of the plant and observing the effect. In general, reproductive parts are not as easily replaced as vegetative parts, terminal leaves have greater value than basal leaves, and the loss of plant parts mid-season has a greater negative effect on fitness than removal at the beginning or end of the season. Seeds in particular tend to be very well protected. For example, the seeds of many edible fruits and nuts contain cyanogenic glycosides such as amygdalin. This results from the need to balance the effort needed to make the fruit attractive to animal dispersers while ensuring that the seeds are not destroyed by the animal.|$|E
5|$|The <b>second</b> <b>factor</b> which {{contributed to}} the {{destruction}} of the ARVN 2nd Brigade, II Corps Tactical Zone, was the inability of South Vietnamese commanders to coordinate the withdrawal. In the process of pulling out from the Central Highlands, large numbers of South Vietnamese soldiers and heavy military equipment were stretched out along the narrow corridor of Route 7. Behind the military formation were huge numbers of South Vietnamese civilians who were relatives of the military personnel, as well as government officials and their families. Unfortunately for the South Vietnamese soldiers on the ground, their army simply lacked the logistical system required to maintain the element of secrecy, which South Vietnamese commanders had hoped would enable them to pull out from the region without drawing too much attention from the North Vietnamese. It is hard to fathom how South Vietnamese commanders hoped to move 400,000 civilians in utmost secrecy. So when North Vietnamese forces attacked the South Vietnamese column along Route 7, there was little South Vietnamese commanders could do to prevent the destruction of their units.|$|E
5|$|While {{writing in}} Japan was limited during the 5th and 6th centuries, {{the number of}} {{documents}} written locally increased in the 7th century; though {{most of them have}} been lost. By the end of the 7th century increased cultural dependence on China caused reading and writing, particularly in government and religion, to {{become an integral part of}} Japanese life. There were two major factors for this development: starting with the Taika Reforms (645–649) and continuing with the Asuka Kiyomihara Code (689) and censuses from 670 and 690, a Chinese style centralised state was formed, requiring the need for a large number of officials who were literate and educated in, among others, Confucian texts at the Daigakuryo ("University") founded under Emperor Tenchi. The <b>second</b> <b>factor</b> was the increasing popularity of Buddhism, which had been introduced to Japan in the mid-6th century and strongly promoted by Prince Shōtoku (574–622). The Sangyō Gisho ("Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras"), traditionally attributed to Prince Shōtoku, is the oldest extant Japanese text of any length. Buddhism required the study of sutras written in Chinese and the state founded a Sutra Copying Bureau (shakyōjo) before 727. The oldest Japanese books are two chronicles, Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, from the early 8th century. While the phonogram orthography enjoyed increasing popularity during the 8th century, it was not yet used for longer prose. The modern kana, notably hiragana and katakana were developed in the Heian period.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was twofold: Firstly an {{existing}} Workvalues questionnaire was evaluated against criteria for test construction; and secondly the role of differential item skewness in the groups of <b>second</b> order <b>factors,</b> within this Workvalues questionnaire, was empirically investigated.

25|$|Israel's net {{international}} migration balance {{and the total}} immigration between 1948 and 1994 was 80 per cent, pointing to a missing share, i.e., a ratio of immigrants to emigrants, of 20 percent.

25|$|Elinor Ostrom, and {{her colleagues}} looked at how {{real-world}} communities manage communal resources, such as fisheries, land irrigation systems, and farmlands, and they {{identified a number of}} factors conducive to successful resource management. One factor is the resource itself; resources with definable boundaries (e.g., land) can be preserved much more easily. A <b>second</b> <b>factor</b> is resource dependence; there must be a perceptible threat of resource depletion, and it must be difficult to find substitutes. The third is the presence of a community; small and stable populations with a thick social network and social norms promoting conservation do better. A final condition is that there be appropriate community-based rules and procedures in place with built-in incentives for responsible use and punishments for overuse. When the commons is taken over by non-locals, those solutions can no longer be used.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol gallstones develop when bile {{contains}} {{too much}} cholesterol {{and not enough}} bile salts. Besides {{a high concentration of}} cholesterol, two other factors are important in causing gallstones. The first is how often and how well the gallbladder contracts; incomplete and infrequent emptying of the gallbladder may cause the bile to become overconcentrated and contribute to gallstone formation. This can be caused by high resistance to the flow of bile out of the gallbladder due to the complicated internal geometry of the cystic duct. The <b>second</b> <b>factor</b> is the presence of proteins in the liver and bile that either promote or inhibit cholesterol crystallization into gallstones. In addition, increased levels of the hormone estrogen, as a result of pregnancy or hormone therapy, or the use of combined (estrogen-containing) forms of hormonal contraception, may increase cholesterol levels in bile and also decrease gallbladder movement, resulting in gallstone formation.|$|E
25|$|Females are oviparous, {{with three}} to eleven rather large, {{leathery}} eggs being laid (four to six are most common). These are incubated by the female {{under the ground}} (via a shivering motion), and hatch after 55 to 60 days. Sexual maturity is reached at 11–18 months for males, and 20–36 months for females. Age is only one factor in determining sexual maturity and ability to breed; weight is the <b>second</b> <b>factor.</b> Males breed at 600 g or more, but in captivity are often not bred until they are 800 g (1.7 lb), although in captivity, some males {{have been known to}} begin breeding at 300-400 g. Females breed in the wild at weights as low as 800 g though 1200 g or more in weight is most common; in captivity, breeders generally wait until they are no less than 1500g (3.3lb). Parental care of the eggs ends once they hatch, and the female leaves the offspring to fend for themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the mixed-design ANOVA uses both between-subject {{variables}} and within-subject variables (a.k.a. repeated measures), it is necessary to partition out (or separate) the between-subject effects and the within-subject effects.

As can be seen in the source table provided below, the between-subject variables can be partitioned into the main effect of the first factor and into the error term. The within-subjects terms can be partitioned into three terms: the <b>second</b> (within-subjects) <b>factor,</b> the interaction term for the first and <b>second</b> <b>factors,</b> and the error term.

25|$|A <b>second</b> <b>factor</b> {{included}} religious developments. The Middle Ages {{gave way}} to new modes of religious thinking. Devotio Moderna practices, for example, were particularly strong in the region, while the 16th-century criticisms of the Catholic Church that spread throughout Europe also reached the Low Countries. Humanists such as Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam were critical but remained loyal to the church. However, {{the spread of the}} Protestant Reformation, started by Martin Luther in 1517, eventually led to outright war. The Reformation, particularly the ideas of John Calvin, gained significant support in the Low Countries, and following the 1566 iconoclastic outbreaks Spain attempted to quell the tide and maintain the authority of the post-Tridentine Church through force by installing Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba. The repression that followed led to the Dutch Revolt, the beginning of the Eighty Years War, and the establishment of the Dutch Republic in the northern provinces. Subsequently, the Southern Netherlands became a bastion for the Counter Reformation, while Calvinism was the main religion of those in power in the Dutch Republic.|$|E
25|$|One factor fueling General American's {{popularity}} was {{the major}} demographic change of twentieth-century American society: increased suburbanization, leading to less mingling of different social classes and less density and diversity of linguistic interactions. As a result, wealthier and higher-educated Americans' communications became more restricted to their own demographic, which, alongside their new marketplace that transcended regional boundaries (arising from the century's faster transportation methods), reinforced a widespread belief that highly educated Americans should not possess a regional accent. A General American sound is then the result of both suburbanization and suppression of regional accent by highly educated Americans in formal settings. A <b>second</b> <b>factor</b> was a rise in immigration to the Great Lakes area (one native region of General American speech) following the region's rapid industrialization after the American Civil War, when this region's speakers went on to form a successful and highly mobile business elite, who travelled {{around the country in}} the mid-twentieth century, spreading the high status of their accent system. A third possible factor is that various sociological (often race- and class-based) forces unconsciously repelled socially-conscious Americans away from pronunciations associated with African Americans and poor white communities in the South and with Southern and Eastern European immigrant communities (for example, American Jews) in the coastal Northeast, instead settling upon or favoring pronunciations more prestigiously associated with White Anglo-Saxon Protestant culture in the remainder of the country: namely, the West, Midwest, and western New England.|$|E
500|$|The <b>second</b> <b>factor</b> {{that brought}} about change was {{the early modern}} {{ascendancy}} of the individual, and focus on privacy. Already in the later Middle Ages castles had begun to incorporate {{an increasing number of}} private chambers, for the use both of the lord and of his servants. Once the castle was discarded to the benefit of palaces or stately homes, this tendency was reinforced.
