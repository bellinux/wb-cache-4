Late dry season fires reduced plant and seed density at Gouldian finch breeding sites relative to sites that had experienced early dry season fires. Presumably, reduced Sorghum spp. density resulted from seed kill during medium to high intensity fires {{in the previous year}} (Scott et al. 2010). In contrast, we found no evidence of a fire frequency effect on Sorghum spp. seed production, and only a marginal influence of time since fire on seed numbers produced per plant. Lack of a time since fire or a fire frequency effect on Sorghum spp. seed density appears to contradict previous studies that associate frequent fires with high density Sorghum spp. populations (Russell-Smith et al. 2002, Russell-Smith et al. 2003, Scott et al. 2010).

In this study we present the <b>seasonal</b> <b>impacts</b> irrigation practices can have on groundwater resources in a temperate humid region, where the average annual rain/PET ratio is 1. 0. In this system the irrigation expansion is solely supported by groundwater pumping, but despite this only 5 boreholes are monitored for hydraulic head data. In this study, we compensate the scarce hydrophysical dataset by incorporating environmental tracers (major ions, δ 18 O, δ 2 H and δ 13 C) and dating tracers (3 H, CFC, SF 6 and 14 C). Results indicate that at 9 of the 15 irrigation sites investigated, groundwater pumping for irrigation has induced the mixing of recent groundwater (up to 20 years). The changes in flow pathways, induced by irrigation, also results in seasonal declines in groundwater NO 3 concentrations due to mixing with older waters. In temperate humid areas, such evaluations of the seasonal evolution of water residence time, mixing process, and agrochemical contaminants are an important contribution to real water resources management in irrigated catchments...|$|R
40|$|Wind and {{hydropower}} together constitute nearly 80 % of the renewable {{capacity in}} Australia and their resources are collocated. We show that wind and hydro generation capacity factors covary negatively at the interannual time scales.

The asynchrony of wind and hydropower resources is explained by the diferential impact of the two modes of the El Ni˜no Southern Oscillation – canonical and Modoki – on the wind and hydro resources. Also, the Modoki El Ni˜no and the Modoki La Ni˜na phases have greater impact. The <b>seasonal</b> <b>impact</b> patterns corroborate these results.

Answering this question involves a tradeoff between validity and reliability, since unfortunately the most reliable measure (achievement) is the least-valid measure as well. In this paper, we evaluate the tradeoff using a simple covariance-structure model. The results suggest that, when achievement is compared to learning and impact, reliability is a minor issue compared to validity. Although achievement is more reliable than learning or impact, achievement’s advantage in reliability is much smaller than its disadvantage in validity. Our findings support the view that reliability is not a sufficient reason to evaluate schools using achievement levels...|$|E

Many species show extreme individual variation in reproductive investment. Factors driving this variation in adult Sepioteuthis australis {{were evaluated by}} examining allocation of energy to somatic and reproductive growth {{as a function of}} body shape, growth rate, maturation, and hatching season. Hatching season influence was sex-specific; males hatched in warmer months had greater reproductive investment, faster growth, and better somatic and reproductive condition, whereas females hatched in spring and summer had less reproductive investment. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>impacts</b> on life history resulted in an "alternation of generations", with slow-growing squid in poor condition and with high levels of reproductive investment producing a generation with completely different life-history characteristics. This suggests that abiotic and biotic conditions that change seasonally could play a large role in determining energy allocated to reproduction. However, this was not driving trade-offs between size and number of offspring. Life-history trade-offs should be detectable as negative correlations between relevant traits. However, in Sepioteuthis australis there was little evidence of trade-offs between reproduction and growth or condition of individuals, suggesting a "live for today" lifestyle...|$|R

The <b>seasonal</b> <b>impacts</b> {{of climate change}} on groundwater recharge were more significant, with surface overflow resulting in flooding during winter and early spring and drought during summer.

In addition, a comparative study is performed to evaluate the seasonal condition-dependent risk performance of central-inverter and string-inverter grid-tied PV power systems. Major contributions include: 1) risk analysis of <b>seasonal</b> <b>impacts</b> for string and centralized PV systems. Seasonal sensitivities of PV system risks to system structures, temperature variation, solar insolation, and capacitor equivalent series resistance are analyzed; and 2) the incorporation {{of the effect of}} operational conditions and the aging failure model into the PV system risk analysis.

The risk performance is then analyzed with respect to the number of PV strings, PV panel failure rate and inverter repair time. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated on two real-life 20 kW grid-connected PV systems. Application of the proposed method to actual large PV systems can provide valuable information to manage PV system risks, to choose better PV system design options, to develop better maintenance strategies, and thus to realize maximum benefit of photovoltaic power.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how seasonal variations affect the quality of logging residues. The study was hosted by VIDA Energy. Logging residues can be processed and transported within different systems. Today the dominant systems are chipping at landing and bulk transportation of logging residues. In these systems the handling of the logging residues are carried out in the same manner up to the landings. Moisture content at the time of chipping is the primary quality parameter. Fine fractions of logging residues are strongly dependent on moisture content in storage. Another quality parameter is the natural ash content. What constitutes good fuel quality has no simple answers. Costumer’s requirements are often a determining factor. The heating stations have different prerequisites because the boilers and the systems of the heating stations are different.
