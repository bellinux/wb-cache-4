5|$|Egypt {{was ruled}} by the Shi'ite Fatimid dynasty from 969, {{independent}} from the Sunni Abbasid rulers in Baghdad and with a rival Shi'ite caliphconsidered the successor to the Muslim prophet Mohammad. The caliph's chief administrator, called the vizier, was chiefly responsible for governance. From 1121 the system fell into murderous political intrigue and Egypt declined from its previous affluent state. This encouraged Baldwin III of Jerusalem to plan an invasion that was only halted by the payment by Egypt of a tribute of 160,000 gold dinars. In 1163 the deposed vizier, Shawar, visited Zengi's son and successor, Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo, in Damascus seeking political and military support. Some historians have considered Nur ad-Din's support as a visionary attempt to surround the Crusaders, but in practice he prevaricated before responding only {{when it became clear}} that the Crusaders might gain an unassailable foothold on the Nile. Nur al-Din sent his Kurdish general, Shirkuh, who stormed Egypt and restored Shawar. However, Shawar asserted his independence and allied with Baldwin's brother and successor Amalric of Jerusalem. When Amalric broke the alliance in a ferocious attack, Shawar again requested military support from Syria, and Shirkuh was sent by Nur ad-Din for a second time. Amalric retreated, but the victorious Shirkuh had Shawar executed and was appointed vizier. Barely two months later he died, to be succeeded by his nephew, Yusuf ibn Ayyub, who has become known by his honorific 'Salah al-Din', 'the goodness of faith', which in turn has become westernised as Saladin. Nur al-Din died in 1174. He was the first Muslim to unite Aleppo and Damascus in the Crusade era. Some Islamic contemporaries promoted the idea that there was a natural Islamic resurgence under Zengi, through Nur al-Din to Saladin although this was not as straightforward and <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> appears. Saladin imprisoned all the caliph's heirs, preventing them from having children, as opposed to having them all killed, which would have been normal practice, to extinguish the bloodline. Assuming control after the death of his overlord, Nur al-Din, Saladin had the strategic choice of establishing Egypt as an autonomous power or attempting to become the preeminent Muslim in the Eastern Mediterraneanhe chose the latter.|$|E
25|$|For the {{mosquito}} {{to obtain a}} blood meal, it must circumvent the vertebrate's physiological responses. The mosquito, as with all blood-feeding arthropods, has mechanisms to effectively block the hemostasis system with their saliva, which contains a mixture of secreted proteins. Mosquito saliva negatively affects vascular constriction, blood clotting, platelet aggregation, angiogenesis and immunity, and creates inflammation. Universally, hematophagous arthropod saliva contains at least one anti-clotting, one anti-platelet, and one vasodilatory substance. Mosquito saliva also contains enzymes that aid in sugar feeding and antimicrobial agents to control bacterial growth in the sugar meal. The composition of mosquito saliva is relatively <b>simple,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> usually contains fewer than 20 dominant proteins. Despite the great strides in knowledge of these molecules and their role in blood feeding achieved recently, scientists still cannot ascribe functions to {{more than half of}} the molecules found in arthropod saliva. One promising application is the development of anti-clotting drugs, such as clotting inhibitors and capillary dilators, that could be useful for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

500|$|At {{this point}} Lissitzky subscribed fully to suprematism and, under the {{guidance}} of Malevich, helped further develop the movement. In 1919–1920 Lissitzky was a head of Architectural department at the People's Art School where with his students, primarily Lazar Khidekel, he was working on transition from plane to volumetric suprematism. Lissitzky designed On the New System of Art by Malevich, who responded in December 1919: [...] "Lazar Markovich, I salute you on the publication of this little book". Perhaps the most famous work by Lissitzky from the same period was the 1919 propaganda poster [...] "Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge". Russia was going through a civil war at the time, which was mainly fought between the [...] "Reds" [...] (communists, socialists and revolutionaries) and the [...] "Whites" [...] (monarchists, conservatives, liberals and other socialists who opposed the Bolshevik Revolution). The image of the red wedge shattering the white form, <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was, communicated a powerful message that left no doubt in the viewer's mind of its intention. The piece is often seen as alluding to the similar shapes used on military maps and, along with its political symbolism, was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism into a style his own. He stated: [...] "The artist constructs a new symbol with his brush. This symbol is not a recognizable form of anything that is already finished, already made, or already existent in the world– it is a symbol of a new world, which is being built upon and which exists by the way of the people." ...|$|E

He appeared to do nothing. He listened, he felt, he said the words without forcing anything." [...] Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy's seemingly effortless performances. His four-time co-star Joan Bennett said, [...] "One never had the feeling he was 'acting' in a scene, {{but the truth of}} the situation was actually happening, spontaneously, at the moment he spoke his lines." [...] James Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists, because [...] "You can't mimic reserve and control very well" [...] and [...] "there's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can't be mimicked." [...] Specifically, Tracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills. Barry Nelson said that Tracy [...] "brought the art of reacting to a new height"; Stanley Kramer declared that Tracy [...] "thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures". Millard Kaufman noted that [...] " [...] listened with every fiber of his entire body". Burt Reynolds, in But Enough About Me, similarly noted Tracy's emphasis on naturalism when, as a rookie actor, he observed Tracy on the sets of Inherit the Wind. When Reynolds later introduced himself to Tracy as an actor, Tracy replied, [...] "An actor, huh? Just remember not to ever let anyone catch you at it." ...|$|E
