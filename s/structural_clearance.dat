2500|$|... 163 {{primary and}} {{secondary}} schools were affected by the earthquake, {{most of which were}} closed for three weeks; 90 had full <b>structural</b> <b>clearance</b> and were able to reopen, 24 had reports indicating further assessment and 11 were seriously damaged. Site-sharing plans were made to enable affected schools to relocate, while 9 [...] "learning hubs" [...] were established throughout the city to provide resources and support for students needing to work from home. Some students relocated to other centres– by 5 March, a total of 4879 Christchurch students had enrolled in other schools across New Zealand. Wanaka Primary School alone had received 115 new enrolments as Christchurch families moved to their holiday homes in the town.|$|E

50|$|Third party review may be {{required}} for major building systems. An example {{of this would be}} a commercial chiller which would be furnished by the mechanical contractor, but would require electrical connections, plumbing, rigging, insulation and commissioning. Various third parties will need to review the installation information and confirm they are furnishing compatible equipment and proper layout of services. Review of installation information for major equipment should be reviewed with field supervisors including the project superintendent, trade foremen and field engineer. Installation of major equipment will dictate <b>structural</b> <b>clearances</b> and temporary openings.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to verify the functional and structural capability of the Centaur D- 1 A nose fairing. A full-scale flight-type nose fairing was jettisoned at the Lewis Research Center Space Power Chamber at simulated altitude. Two complete jettisons of the nose fairing were performed, one without aft helper springs and one with aft helper springs. A ''static'' rotation test was also performed to verify capability of the helper springs and to allow clearance measurements between the nose fairing and spacecraft envelope mock-up at certain discrete nose fairing rotation angles. Nose fairing trajectories, <b>structural</b> deflections, <b>clearances,</b> and hinge forces during jettison are presented. Data from subsequent Centaur D- 1 A flights, relative to nose fairing jettisons, are compared with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|PCO用(防除業者用) としての 2 流体ノズルを備えた防除機(アクチゾル・スプレーヤ) の散布特性が, 慣行散布法による防除機(蓄圧式スプレーヤ及びエアロゾルスベレーヤ) の散布特性と比較された. アクチゾルスプレーヤの特性は, ゴキブリやその他の害虫が住む建造物の壁の間隙(奥深い棲息場所) への噴霧液の貫通性(到達性) と付着効率に関して, 慣行散布機の特性よりもすぐれていることが確認された. アクチゾールスプレーヤは, コンプレッサーをシステムに持ちながら, 小型で可搬性に富み, 噴霧液滴が微細なために農薬散布はドライ処理となるので, 農業分野(例えば温室) での適用が可能であると思われる. 加えて供試機の吐出量は少量または微量散布に相当するので静電散布のシステムに利用できると思われる. A {{comparison}} {{was made}} on application characteristics between a sprayer with twin-fluid nozzle and conventional sprayers for PCO 2 ̆ 7 s (pest control operators). It {{was found that the}} application characteristics of Actisol sprayer were superior to those of such conventional sprayers as a compressed air sprayer and an aerosol sprayer in respect to the penetrating perfomance and the deposition efficiency of spray droplets in <b>structural</b> wall <b>clearances</b> used by cockroaches and other insect pests as their harbourages. Actisol sprayer is considered to be suitable for the agriculture area (for instance, green houses) because it is small and portable in spite of a compressor in its system, and applies chemicals by dry treatment. It appears, additionaly, that Actisol sprayer may be used as an electrostatic sprayer because its output corresponds to very low volume or ultra low volume application...|$|R
40|$|The X- 29 A {{research}} and technology demonstrator aircraft has completed {{a highly successful}} multiphase flight test program. The primary research objective was to safely explore, evaluate, and validate a number of aerodynamic, structural, and flight control technologies, all highly integrated into the vehicle design. Most of these advanced technologies, particularly the forward-swept-wing platform, had {{a major impact on}} the structural design. Throughout the flight test program, <b>structural</b> loads <b>clearance</b> was an ongoing activity to provide a safe maneuvering envelope sufficient to accomplish the research objectives. An overview is presented of the technologies, flight test approach, key results, and lessons learned from the structural flight loads perspective. The overall design methodology was considered validated, but a number of structural load characteristics were either not adequately predicted or totally unanticipated prior to flight test. While conventional flight testing techniques were adequate to insure flight safety, advanced analysis tools {{played a key role in}} understanding some of the structural load characteristics, and in maximizing flight test productivity...|$|R
40|$|Telescopic {{systems of}} <b>structural</b> members with <b>clearance</b> {{are found in}} many applications, e. g., mobile cranes, rack feeders, fork lifters, stacker cranes (see Figure 1). Operating these machines, {{undesirable}} vibrations may reduce the performance and increase safety problems. Therefore, this contribution has the aim to reduce these harmful vibrations. For a better understanding, the dynamic behaviour of these constructions is analysed. The main interest is the overlapping area of each two sections of the above described systems (see markings in Figure 1) which is investigated by measurements and by computations. A test rig is constructed to determine the dynamic behaviour by measuring fundamental vibrations and higher frequent oscillations, damping coefficients, special appearances and more. For an appropriate physical model, the governing boundary value problem is derived by applying Hamilton’s principle and a classical discretisation procedure is used to generate a coupled system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations as the corresponding truncated mathematical model. On {{the basis of this}} model, a controller concept for preventing harmful vibrations is developed...|$|R
40|$|Reduced {{nitric oxide}} synthase {{activity}} in rats with chronic renal disease due to glomerulonephritis. BackgroundAnimal studies with systemic {{nitric oxide synthase}} (NOS) inhibition and renal ablation, suggest that NO deficiency is both a cause and a consequence of chronic renal disease (CRD). MethodsThis study examined a glomerulonephritis (GN) model of CRD to determine if NO is deficient. In addition to measuring indices of renal function (proteinuria, creatinine <b>clearance,</b> <b>structural</b> damage), indices of total and renal nitric oxide production also were assessed (total NOX excretion, renal NOS activity, renal NOS protein abundance, plasma levels of NOS substrate and endogenous inhibitor). ResultsRats developed increasing proteinuria 12 to 20 weeks after induction of GN (with anti-glomerular basement membrane, GBM, antibody) and at 20 weeks exhibited reduced creatinine clearances and increased glomerulosclerosis relative to age-matched controls. Total NOX excretion was reduced and the renal cortical NOS activity and neuronal NOS (nNOS) abundance was decreased relative to controls. There was no impact on renal or aortic endothelial NOS expression or cerebellar nNOS. The plasma L-arginine (Arg) concentration was well maintained but plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentration increased in GN versus control animals. ConclusionsTotal and renal NOS activity is reduced in the GN model of CRD due to increased circulating endogenous NOS inhibitors and decreased renal nNOS abundance...|$|R
2500|$|The Gulfstream II is a twin-jet {{swept wing}} {{corporate}} transport powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines {{and designed to}} provide high speed and long range capability without sacrificing the airport performance, reliability, and other operational advantages of its predecessor, the turboprop Gulfstream I. Preliminary design of the wing was influenced by both cruise and low speed considerations. The aft-mounted engine location was selected after extensive analysis and design iterations considering aerodynamic, <b>structural,</b> and ground <b>clearance</b> requirements. Airfoil geometry was developed to maximum sweep benefit from the selected planform. [...] The interference problem at the wing-body juncture was treated by modification of the airfoil shape and thickness over the inner third of the wing span. The basic airfoils for the main area of the wing {{are similar to those}} of the Grumman A-6 Intruder aircraft and utilize NACA 6-series thickness distributions combined with an in-house mean line. A buffet boundary commensurate with the M=.85 speed capability was attained by incorporating a row of co-rotating vortex generators on the outer wing panel. In developing the wing contours, attention was paid to the aircraft's low speed requirements by tailoring the leading edge radius to preclude leading edge separation. The high lift configuration, consists of a one piece, single-slotted Fowler flap of 30% chord. [...] Stall initiation on the basic wing was found to occur at midspan but spread rapidly to the tip, particularly at large flap deflections. The addition of an upper surface fence at about midspan provided a strong pitch down at the stall, without sacrificing maximum lift, and also afforded an adequate margin between initial and tip stall.|$|R
40|$|Pharmacokinetic {{studies of}} the {{immunosuppressive}} compound mycophenolic acid (MPA) have shown a <b>structural</b> decrease in <b>clearance</b> (CL) over time after renal transplantation. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the time-dependent CL of MPA by means of a population pharmacokinetic meta-analysis, and to test whether it can be described by covariate effects. One thousand eight hundred and ninety-four MPA concentration-time profiles from 468 renal transplant patients (range 1 - 9 profiles per patient) were analyzed retrospectively by nonlinear mixed effect modelling. Sampling occasions ranged from day 1 - 10 years after transplantation. The pharmacokinetics of MPA were described by a two-compartment model with time-lagged first order absorption, and a first-order term for time-dependent CL. The model predicted the mean CL to decrease from 35 l h(- 1) (CV = 44 %) in the first week after transplantation to 17 l h(- 1) (CV = 38 %) after 6 months. In a covariate model without a term for time-dependent CL, changes during the first 6 months after transplantation in creatinine clearance from 19 to 71 ml min(- 1), in albumin concentration from 35 to 40 g l(- 1), in haemoglobin from 9. 7 to 12 g dl(- 1) and in cyclosporin predose concentration from 225 to 100 ng ml(- 1) corresponded with a decrease of CL from 32 to 19 l h(- 1). Creatinine clearance, albumin concentration, haemoglobin and cyclosporin predose concentration explained, respectively, 19 %, 12 %, 4 % and 3 % of the within-patient variability in MPA CL. By monitoring creatinine clearance, albumin concentration, haemoglobin and cyclosporin predose concentration, changes in MPA exposure over time can be predicted. Such information can be used to optimize therapy with mycophenolate mofeti...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Insulin {{degrading}} enzyme (IDE) is {{implicated in}} the regulation of amyloid β (Aβ) steady-state levels in the brain, and its deficient expression and/or activity may be a risk factor in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although IDE sub-cellular localization has been well studied, the compartments relevant to Aβ degradation remain to be determined. Results Our results of live immunofluorescence, immuno gold electron-microscopy and gradient fractionation concurred to the demonstration that endogenous IDE from brain tissues and cell cultures is, {{in addition to its}} other localizations, a detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) -associated metallopeptidase. Our pulse chase experiments were in accordance with the existence of two pools of IDE: the cytosolic one with a longer half-life and the membrane-IDE with a faster turn-over. DRMs-associated IDE co-localized with Aβ and its distribution (DRMs vs. non-DRMs) and activity was sensitive to manipulation of lipid composition in vitro and in vivo. When IDE was mis-located from DRMs by treating cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), endogenous Aβ accumulated in the extracellular space and exogenous Aβ proteolysis was impaired. We detected a reduced amount of IDE in DRMs of membranes isolated from mice brain with endogenous reduced levels of cholesterol (Chol) due to targeted deletion of one seladin- 1 allele. We confirmed that a moderate shift of IDE from DRMs induced a substantial decrement on IDE-mediated insulin and Aβ degradation in vitro. Conclusion Our results support the notion that optimal substrate degradation by IDE may require its association with organized-DRMs. Alternatively, DRMs but not other plasma membrane regions, may act as platforms where Aβ accumulates, due to its hydrophobic properties, reaching local concentration close to its Km for IDE facilitating its <b>clearance.</b> <b>Structural</b> integrity of DRMs may also be required to tightly retain insulin receptor and IDE for insulin proteolysis. The concept that mis-location of Aβ degrading proteases away from DRMs may impair the physiological turn-over of Aβ in vivo deserves further investigation in light of therapeutic strategies based on enhancing Aβ proteolysis in which DRM protease-targeting may need to be taken into account. </p...|$|R
