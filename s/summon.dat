50|$|A simple <b>summons</b> is a {{document}} which contains the basis (the particulars of the claim) for the plaintiff's {{action in the}} body of the <b>summons.</b> The simple <b>summons</b> is the High Court equivalent of the ordinary <b>summons</b> in the Magistrate's Court. A combined <b>summons,</b> on the other hand, has a more detailed and separate document containing the particulars of claim and is annexed to the <b>summons.</b> As a general rule, the simple <b>summons</b> is used where the claim is for a debt or a liquidated demand. There are certain matters for which a combined <b>summons</b> is prescribed: for example, in divorce matters. In the High Court, however, it is customary only to use a simple <b>summons</b> when one is certain that it is appropriate to do so.|$|R

2500|$|The {{manner of}} <b>summoning</b> barons to the Council was {{influential}} {{in the development of}} the Peerage. Ecclesiastical dignitaries and the greater barons were <b>summoned</b> by a writ of <b>summons</b> issued directly from the King, while lesser barons were <b>summoned</b> through the local sheriffs. Such a system existed as early as 1164, when Henry II withheld a personal <b>summons</b> to Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, after engaging with him in a conflict with over the rights of the Church, instead subjecting him to a <b>summons</b> through a sheriff. For the rest of the twelfth century, the dividing line between barons <b>summoned</b> by writs personally addressed to them and barons <b>summoned</b> through the sheriffs became well-defined, but the Crown sometimes arbitrarily subjected the greater barons to <b>summons</b> through sheriffs. In the Magna Carta, King John declared, [...] "we will cause to be <b>summoned</b> the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons, severally by our letters." [...] He also agreed that the lesser barons would be [...] "summoned generally, through our sheriffs and bailiffs." ...|$|R
5|$|Each side can {{construct}} {{two types}} of magical buildings, each of which produces one type of spellcaster and researches more advanced spells for that type. These advanced buildings can be constructed only with assistance from other buildings. The Human Cleric and Orc Necrolyte can both defend themselves by magic and also see distant parts of the territory for short periods. The Cleric's other spells are protective, healing the injured and making troops invisible, while the Necrolyte raises skeletons as troops and can make other units temporarily invulnerable, {{at the cost of}} severely damaging them when the spell dissipates. The Human Conjurer and Orc Warlock have energy blasts, wider-range destruction spells and the ability to <b>summon</b> small, venomous monsters. The Conjurer can <b>summon</b> a water elemental, while the Warlock can <b>summon</b> a demonic melee unit.|$|E

5|$|In Final Fantasy X, Yuna is {{introduced}} as a summoner who can use healing magic {{and is able}} to <b>summon</b> powerful magical entities called aeons with help from spirits known as Fayths.

Yuna must journey to temples across the world, acquire the aeon from each and <b>summon</b> the Final Aeon in a battle that will kill them both. She gradually becomes more open and falls in love with Tidus. Upon arriving at the place where Yuna can <b>summon</b> the final aeon, Tidus persuades the group to look for another way to defeat Sin without using any sacrifices. After entering Sin's body, Yuna and her guardians defeat the disembodied spirit of Yu Yevon, who is responsible for reviving Sin after each defeat, allowing an eternal Calm to start in Spira. However, Tidus disappears as he is the product of the Fayth, who could not depart until Sin's defeat.|$|E
5|$|Like in {{the first}} game, Sora can <b>summon</b> a Disney {{character}} to aid him in battle.

Instead of being limited to only one action, Summons now have a menu of their own and are capable of performing solo or cooperative actions with Sora. These actions are performed by pressing the triangle button. The <b>Summon</b> ability and each Drive Form are leveled up separately and by different criteria; obtaining higher levels allows for extended use and in the case of Drive Forms, access to new abilities.|$|E

A legend {{in the region of}} Leskovac has it that fighting the ale was originated by Prophet Elijah, when he, accompanied by a dragon boy, killed twelve of these demons. In the popular tradition of Slavic peoples, Prophet Elijah is a Christian replacement of the pagan Slavic thunder god Perun.|$|E
50|$|The {{plaintiff}} {{starts a}} civil case by filing a <b>summons,</b> and generally a complaint, with the clerk of circuit court and paying a filing fee. A <b>summons</b> provides the defendant notice that a suit has been filed against him or her and notifies the defendant {{that he or she}} must answer the complaint.
