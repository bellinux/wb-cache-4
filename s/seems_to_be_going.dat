She learns Kuchipudi, a classical Indian dance form, while being employed at a local landlady's house. All <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> well for her until sexual chemistry evolves {{between her and the}} landlady's son, and this eventually leads her being raped by him.

As he settles into life with new wife Beryl and her son, Robert in Melbourne, Gordon finds himself content with life.|$|E

Physicist John Waldram {{recalled}} overhearing Nicholas Kurti, an examiner from Oxford, discuss Josephson's exam results with David Shoenberg, the reader in physics at Cambridge, and asking: [...] "Who is this chap Josephson? He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> through the theory {{like a knife}} through butter." [...] While still an undergraduate, he published a paper on the Mössbauer effect, pointing out a crucial issue other researchers had overlooked. According to one eminent physicist speaking to Physics World, Josephson wrote several papers important enough to assure him {{a place in the}} history of physics even without his discovery of the Josephson effect.|$|E

The special aired again on December 24, 2002 on Channel 4 in the UK. The Birmingham Evening Mail reviewed the show, writing, [...] "Criss Angel is currently making {{a name for himself}} as a more provocative, darker alternative to [...] He walks the streets of New York, hypnotising passers-by, turning cups of take-away coffee into cockroaches and suspending himself from the ceiling by inserting hooks into his back.

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Travis Fickett {{rated the}} episode 7.5/10, {{explaining that he}} liked the [...] "attention to bits of logic that work as the glue, holding the show together" [...] such as Peter's security clearance, but was skeptical of the episode's fringe science. Fickett also noticed many similarities to The X-Files, writing [...] "not enough {{is being done to}} move the show into its own direction"; he concluded [...] "The production values are exceptional, the acting is top notch, and it certainly <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> somewhere. Where, is another matter all together, but {{there does seem to be}} momentum." [...] Website blogger io9 highlighted [...] "The Arrival" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to understand the show. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "The Arrival" [...] the twelfth best episode of the series, explaining the episode [...] "formally, memorably introduced the Observer known as September (Michael Cerveris), a Tabasco-loving, Fedora-wearing, bald-headed time traveling surveyor from the future. His altercation with Peter in the graveyard — mirroring his movements; parroting his speech in real time — was one of the show's earliest water-cooler-weird moments." ...|$|E
500|$|Giuliani {{continued}} to ponder his senate race decision; {{when he had}} dinner with Nathan on May 12, they were trailed by a flock of photographers. [...] Giuliani canceled campaigning and fundraising trips to upstate New York and California on May 13, suggesting he would not run, but then resumed fundraising and suggested he was inclined towards running on May 15. [...] Two Republican county chairmen became upset at the indecision, saying, [...] "Like Waiting for Godot, we have Waiting for Rudy", and, [...] "We need a decision. Like tomorrow would be nice. Because this is getting ridiculous." [...] A top state Republican said, [...] "He seem to like the attention. He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> through some sort of catharsis in public. And we're like psychiatrists watching it. I can't quite figure it out. I don't think anybody can." [...] Clinton, meanwhile, said {{as little as possible}} about the situation, preferring to let Giuliani's drama play out on its own; on May 17, as he huddled with his doctors over whether to choose surgery or radiation as his treatment while facing conflicting political advice from his aides, she won the unanimous approval of delegates to the Democratic Party state convention at the Pepsi Arena in Albany, giving a constrained acceptance speech because she did not know her general election opponent.|$|E

500|$|The song has {{received}} generally positive reviews from most music critics. Sam Lanksy of Idolator gave the song a favorable review, calling it [...] "an emotional ballad that shows off Mars’ sweet vocals." [...] Lansky also praised it, naming it [...] "another exceptional offering from Unorthodox Jukebox, which {{is shaping up}} {{to be one of the}} year’s best pop releases." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust gave the song a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting that 'When I Was Your Man' is [...] "a much more satisfying, less ostentatious ballad than 'Young Girls'— though maybe the lyrics are a little too clichéd to result in a classic soul ballad the way Bruno <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> for." [...] However, he praised Mars, which according to him, [...] "nobody puts a song like this over quite like him, and when he hits the big high note on the song’s bridge, it’s about as striking a moment as you’re likely to hear on a pop record this year. It might be a little too perfect to be as devastating as a song like 'Someone Like You', but it might be a big hit just the same, and it’s guaranteed to absolutely slay in a live set." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was positive, writing that [...] "Old-school charm still gets Mars the furthest, and the best thing here is the classic torch song 'When I Was Your Man', which finds him at the piano listing all the ways he wronged an ex. 'Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life,' he cries in his Sinatra-smooth tenor, oozing charm. Maybe he's a jerk. But he's the jerk that girl's going home with tonight." ...|$|E

2500|$|Keble {{claimed that}} this {{movement}} was always [...] "traceable {{to the same}} decay or want of faith, the same deficiency in Christian resignation and thankfulness, which leads so many, as individuals, to disdain and forfeit the blessings of the Gospel. Men not impressed with religious principle attribute their ill success in life,—the hard times they have to struggle with,—to anything rather than their own ill-desert: and {{the institutions of the}} country, ecclesiastical and civil, are always at hand to bear the blame of whatever <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> amiss".

2500|$|Reading [...] the 20th century Israeli scholar Nechama Leibowitz {{wrote that}} people in their {{blindness}} tend to detect the guiding hand of Providence only when manifested in visible miracles, as the Israelites witnessed in the wilderness. People fail to see the hidden miracles performed for them continually when {{the world around them}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> on as usual. For this reason, the formulators of the liturgy obliged Jews to give thanks three times daily (in the final benedictions of the Amidah prayer) [...] "for Your miracles that are with us every day and for Your wonders and Your bounties that are at all times, evening, morning, and noon." ...|$|E
2500|$|If the {{manifold}} is 4 dimensional, {{this does}} not work: {{the problem is that}} a disc in general position may have double points where two points of the disc have the same image. This is the main reason why the usual proof of the h-cobordism theorem only works for cobordisms whose boundary has dimension at least 5. We can try to get rid of these double points as follows. Draw a line on the disc joining two points with the same image. If the image of this line is the boundary of an embedded disc (called a Whitney disc), then it is easy to remove the double point. However this argument <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> round in circles: in order to eliminate a double point of the first disc, we need to construct a second embedded disc, whose construction involves exactly the same problem of eliminating double points.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, Phineas Taylor (P.T.) Barnum {{introduces}} his circus acts as he stands in front of a tent, proclaiming [...] "There Is a Sucker Born Ev'ry Minute". He loves spectacle and excitement, using hype and [...] "humbug" [...] to promote his exhibits. His wife Charity disagrees with his use of [...] "humbug" [...] but loves him and aims to keep him grounded. Barnum then introduces the oldest woman alive, Joice Heth, and thanks to some Barnum humbug she becomes a success ("Thank God I'm Old"). His wife Charity ("Chairy") urges him to get a job in a factory, but Barnum refuses ("The Colors of My Life [...] ") and Charity wryly admits and accepts the disparity between their views ("The Colors of My Life [...] "). Barnum enlists clowns to help in building a museum to house his attractions (with expected comical results) and it's up to Charity to encourage him to keep going ("One Brick at a Time"), with the result that [...] "everything about [...] museum was spectacular" [...] ("Museum Song"); however, the museum burns down accidentally. Barnum finds two new star attractions, Tom Thumb, who appears to advise that [...] "Bigger Isn't Better", and Jumbo the elephant. Barnum then becomes manager of the famous Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind ("Love Makes Such Fools of Us All"). Barnum becomes enamored of her and sees the attraction of going on tour with her ("Out There"). He accompanies Jenny on tour, leaving Charity behind, as a marching band greets them ("Come Follow the Band"). Although all <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> well for Barnum, he finds that without Charity in his life he is miserable, and he decides to break ties with Jenny and return home to the woman he loves ("Love Makes Such Fools of Us All [...] "). Upon his return to Charity, he promises to live the more sedate life she desires for him, in [...] "Black and White." [...] After a failed stint running a clockworks factory and a failed attempt to build his own city, he turns to politics; when his campaign looks doomed to fail due to lack of interest, Charity realizes how important his talents and passion are in his life and allows him to inject color and life into his campaign. He is elected Mayor of Bridgeport, {{and the two of them}} recognize the value in each other's approach to life and how they complement one another ("The Colors of My Life [...] "). Barnum is prepared to run for President, but his beloved Charity dies suddenly, leaving Barnum bereft and alone. When Barnum finds himself cheated of the Presidential nomination by his political party, he laments his position, realizes that his talent for Humbug will never leave him and wishes to [...] "make it right, shoot a rocket, shine a light" [...] ("Prince of Humbug"). James Anthony Bailey arrives and offers him the chance to [...] "Join the Circus". Initially resisting, he relents (thanks in part to Charity's two-headed coin, which she has used to humbug him throughout the show) and joins Bailey, and they form the famous circus Barnum and Bailey.|$|E
