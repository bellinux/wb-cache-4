40|$|We {{are rapidly}} {{approaching}} {{the time when}} zero carryback will be demanded by the environmentalists and OSHA. The carryback in reference is the fines that cling to <b>the</b> conveyor <b>belt</b> after <b>the</b> <b>belt's</b> cargo has been discharged over the head pulley. Having resisted the centrifugal force to be thrown off with the cargo, these fines are sticky enough to remain on <b>the</b> <b>belt.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> returns to <b>the</b> tail pulley, the idlers that support <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> and <b>the</b> pulleys that bend <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> dislodge this carried back material, causing it to fall and collect in piles and the very fine particles to become airborne. Recently I visited a plant that had a 42 " wide conveyor belt carrying lignite from storage into the plant. An engineer was assigned to make a study determining if the fugitive material that was creating the "DURT" " problem was coming from <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> and if it was, {{what to do about}} it. He was undecided if it was fugitive because of carryback or because of wind effect as the wind swept across the conveyor. If indeed the problem was from wind effect, a gallery would have to be built to enclose the conveyor. Assisting in this investigation, 1 placed a carryback gauge against <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> return <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conveyor <b>belt</b> near <b>the</b> head pulley. This gauge is a measuring device with blades that will scrape a one inch wide area when pressed against <b>the</b> moving <b>belt.</b> Any particles clinging to <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> are scraped off and collected in <b>the</b> container <b>of</b> <b>the</b> device. The carryback gauge was placed against <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> at three different locations across <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> belt; in the center and 10 inches left and right <b>of</b> center. <b>The</b> removed carryback material was measured. It was found to be an average of. 08 ounces in a 10 second period. <b>The</b> <b>belt</b> was traveling at 592 feet per minute...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: To {{investigate}} parametrically forced excitation and transverse oscillations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> {{with local}} heterogeneity, a new dynamic {{model of a}} V-belt drive with longitudinal motion has been developed. The model shows that when an appropriate quantitative and qualitative level of local heterogeneity is achieved, <b>the</b> oscillation mode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> starts to change, and <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> tensile force developing due to deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> significantly increases. Another V-belt drive dynamic model was developed based on the finite element model (FEM) analysis. This {{was used to examine}} <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> containing local heterogeneity, with the pulley in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> contact angle. <b>The</b> natural frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system were calcu-lated and the system’s response to harmonic excitation was established. The correlation between <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> defects in <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> and vibration activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving pulley bearing housing was established. Using the developed model, the relationship between <b>the</b> defective <b>belt</b> and <b>the</b> dynamic component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vibration reaction force <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driven pulley was studied. Spectrum components are identified and are used in <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> drive’s practical diagnostics. The method developed based on these models enables non-destructive assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> failure state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mounted <b>belt</b> to be performed in order to assess <b>the</b> failure state <b>of</b> different belt drive types...|$|R
