40|$|Hull-girder {{residual}} strength after grounding was investigated for four double <b>hull</b> <b>tankers,</b> three bulk carriers and one <b>single</b> <b>hull</b> VLCC. It is {{noted that the}} loss of section modulus (to the deck and to the bottom) and the loss of ultimate strength (sagging and hogging conditions) are approximately proportional to the transverse damage extent in bottom. Such relationships, when expressed as dimensionless form, do not seem to depend on the ship’s length, but are different for different types of ships. The ship’s speed that results in a given bottom damage extent in a grounding accident is predicted using a simplified analytical method. The influential effects of ship’s speed on the {{residual strength}} of hull-girder are shown. It is revealed that when damaged to a same percent of the ship’s breadth, a double <b>hull</b> <b>tanker</b> and a bulk carrier have comparable hull-girder residual strength, and are better than a <b>single</b> <b>hull</b> <b>tanker.</b> If sailing at a specific speed and running aground, a <b>single</b> <b>hull</b> <b>tanker</b> will have a residual hull-girder strength that is comparable to a double <b>hull</b> <b>tanker</b> of a similar size which loses outer skin only.

40|$|In 1990, the US {{adopted the}} OPA 90 in {{response}} to the Exxon Valdez grounding outside the Alaskan coast in 1989. The OPA 90 was the first legislation demanding double <b>hull</b> on oil <b>tankers</b> in order to prevent the spillage of oil in case of a grounding or collision. The IMO adopted amendments to MARPOL 73 / 78 in 1992, which for example required all new tankers of 600 dwt and above to have double sides or double bottom and tankers of 5, 000 dwt and above to have both double bottom and double sides. The Erika accident outside the French coast shook the EU and a stricter regulation, in comparison with the MARPOL, on double <b>hull</b> <b>tankers</b> was adopted. The Prestige accident in 2002 further spurred the EU to put pressure on the IMO to implement the same accelerated phase out scheme of <b>single</b> <b>hulled</b> <b>tankers</b> as the EU had already adopted. This developed into a battle between the EU and the IMO on the jurisdictional right to prevent marine pollution by phasing out <b>single</b> <b>hulled</b> <b>tankers.</b> The thesis is a descriptive and analytical study of the development of the MARPOL and EU phase out schemes. By presenting the relevant UNCLOS articles it is analyzed how unilateral legislation may prevent <b>single</b> <b>hulled</b> <b>tankers</b> by using the jurisdiction of flag, port, and coastal states. The EU has taken an independent initiative to regulate the phase out stricter than the IMO and chapter 2 examines the jurisdiction of the EU in the field of maritime pollution prevention. The study shows that the EU member states may, by using their flag and port state jurisdiction given to them by the UNCLOS, implement the EU regulation. Chapter 3 describes how the MARPOL and EU schemes on the phasing out of <b>single</b> <b>hulled</b> <b>tankers</b> developed. These schemes came about during a process lasting a decade when both organizations wanted to prove their efficiency to respond quickly to the problems of oil pollution. Finally, the EU, after political pressure from the EU member states and the public opinion, had the IMO adopting the same phase out scheme as the EU but with some exemptions. The shipping industry is vulnerable to unilateral legislation since shipping is an international business and EU politicians are not considered to be as competent in the maritime field as experts of the IMO. Therefore, the IMO needs to take the initiative back from the EU on all matters concerning marine legislation. The last chapter analyzes the possible consequences for the shipping industry due to the phasing out of <b>single</b> <b>hulled</b> <b>tankers.</b> The phase out require, among other things, new tonnage to be built and old tonnage to be scrapped. There are many consequences for the shipping industry when new legislation is made and some of them may be very costly for some of the actors in the shipping industry...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the most recent}} improvements and application of the Simplified Collision Model SIMCOL, developed under SNAME Ad Hoc Panel # 6 for the rapid prediction of collision damage in probabilistic analysis. IMO’s ongoing transition to probabilistic performance-based standards requires the ability to predict the probabilistic environmental performance and safety of specific ship designs. Current IMO regulations use probability density functions (pdfs) to describe the location, extent and penetration of side and bottom damage. These pdfs are derived from lim-ited historical damage statistics, and applied identically to all ships without consideration of their structural design. They do not consider the effect of structural design or crashworthiness on dam-age extent. SIMCOL provides a means to correct this deficiency. SIMCOL’s ability to predict probabilistic damage in real world collision scenarios is demonstrated by application to two ref-erence tanker structural designs, and comparison to the IMO damage pdfs. The comparison is ex-cellent when the struck ship is a <b>single</b> <b>hull</b> <b>tanker</b> consistent with the <b>single</b> <b>hull</b> MARPOL <b>tankers</b> represented by the IMO statistics, {{and because of the}} physics-based models used in SIMCOL, it is reasonable to extrapolate this performance to today’s double <b>hull</b> <b>tankers.</b> NOMENCLATURE x, y- coordinates, ship center of gravity (m) G – ship center of gravity q- ship heading (degrees) f- collision angle (degrees) a 11 - added mass in the surge direction (kg) a 22 - added mass in the sway direction (kg) a 33 - yaw added mass moment of inertia (kg-m 2) ms- ship mass (kg) Is 33 - yaw mass moment of inertia (kg-...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{maritime}} accidents {{have been}} caused by corrosion, and this has led to stringent regulations concerning protective coatings for ballast tanks. The Coating Performance Standard for Ballast Tank Coatings (PSPC), became effective in 2008. It specifies how protective coatings should be applied during vessel construction with the intention of giving a coating a 15-year service life. Additional regulations, such as those established by The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water & Sediments (SBWS) sought to avoid introducing invasive species throughout the world through ship's ballast tanks. [...] The methods used to avoid having these invasive species surviving in ballast tanks however greatly increased the rate of corrosion. Therefore ongoing research attempts to find water treatment systems that kill invasive species, while not having a destructive effect on the ballast tank coatings. As double-hulled tankers were introduced it meant that there was more ballast tank area had to be coated and therefore a greater capital investment for ship owners.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the longitudinal strength of ships with damages due to grounding or collision accidents. Analytical equations are derived for the residual hull girder strength and verified with direct calculations of sample commercial ships for a broad spectrum of accidents. Hull girder ultimate strengths of these sample vessels under sagging and hogging conditions are also calculated, based on which correlation equations are proposed. To evaluate a grounded ship, using the section modulus to the deck would be optimistic, while using the section modulus to the bottom would be conservative. On the contrary, to evaluate a collided ship, using the section modulus to the deck would be conservative, while using the section modulus to the bottom would be optimistic. The derived analytical formulae are then applied to a fleet of 67 commercial ships, including 21 double <b>hull</b> <b>tankers,</b> 18 bulk carriers, 22 <b>single</b> <b>hull</b> <b>tankers</b> and six container carriers. The mean values, standard deviations and coefficients of variation for the coefficients in these new analytical formulae are obtained. The ship length exhibits little influence on these coefficients because they are close to the mean values although ship length spans from 150 to 400 m. The ship type shows some influence on the residual strength. Uniform equations are proposed for commercial ships which do not depend on a ship’s principal dimensions. These formulae provide very handy tools for predicting the residual strength in seconds, without performing step-by-step detailed calculations, an obvious advantage in cases of emergency or salvage operation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It {{is estimated that}} the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) decision to phase-out <b>single</b> <b>hull</b> <b>tankers</b> by 2015 will result in hundreds of ships requiring disposal. At present, the {{ship recycling}} industry is predominantly based in South Asia. Due to the bad practice of current scrapping procedure, the paper will highlight the harm occurring to health, safety and environment. The efforts of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) {{which led to the}} signing of the Hong Kong International Convention are also reviewed. The criteria and standards required to reduce the risk and damage to the environment are discussed and a proposed plan for the safe scrapping of ships is then presented. A technological and economic study for the ship recycling in Egypt is carried out as a case study. This includes the ship recycling facility size and layout. The equipment and staff required to operate the facility are also evaluated. A cost analysis is then carried out. This includes site development, human resources, machineries and equipment.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to assess the ultimate hull girder strength of grounding damaged under longitudinal bending.

The Finite Element Method is used to assess the ultimate hull girder strength including their behavior both <b>single</b> <b>hull</b> bulk carrier and double <b>hull</b> oil <b>tanker.</b> The grounding damage is simply cretaed by removing the element component from the bottom part. Two cases of grounding damage are observed, those are center part and the asymmetric position. For the simple calculation, one-frame space is considered for the longitudinal damage extent in longitudinal direction, and the cross-section of <b>single</b> <b>hull</b> bulk carrier and double <b>hull</b> oil <b>tanker</b> are taken. The transversal damage extent is taken to be equal with the percentage of ship breadth and the vertical damage extent is equal or less than the height of double bottom structure.

5000|$|... 2. Disincentives for fleet {{replacement}} and modernization: Since the Oil Pollution Act {{holds the}} vessel owners fully liable, {{it has created}} a disincentive for oil companies to transport crude oil in their vessels and for charterers to transport their oil on the most suitable vessels. Many financially successful oil companies select the highest quality of ships to transport their products, however, other companies continue to transport their product on the lower quality, older vessels due to the cheaper costs. The majority of charterers refuse {{to pay more for}} higher grade vessels despite the liability and compensation regulations enforced by OPA. The new and safer double <b>hull</b> <b>tanker</b> vessels are approximately 15-20% more costly to operate. In 1992, approximately 60% of global vessels was at least fifteen years old or older. The major oil companies are still delaying the fleet replacement requirement of retiring <b>single</b> <b>hull</b> vessels mandated by OPA. For example, Exxon and Texaco have delayed the replacement of their <b>single</b> <b>hull</b> vessels for new double hulled ships. However, companies like Chevron and Mobil have ordered two new double <b>hull</b> <b>tankers.</b> Leading by example, other independent shipping companies to invest in new double <b>hull</b> <b>tankers</b> as well. Despite the change from single to double tanker vessels, it is still not sufficient enough to accommodate the needs of the oil industry. It is expected that over the next decade there will be a serious lack of suitable tonnage to meet the expected demand for newer vessels. It is estimated that the global oil industry must invest approximately 200-350 billion dollars to meet global demands for new and environmentally sound vessels.|$|R

40|$|Stricter {{international}} regulation {{enacted in}} the early 1990 s and advances made in design and safe operation of tankers saw a significant improvement in the tanker industry safety record. According to The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation, oil pollution from tankers for the period 1997 - 03 was only 25 % of the pollution for the period 1990 - 1996. The total number of reported tanker incidents with pollution for the period 1997 - 03 was only 37 % of the figure for the period 1990 - 1996, {{while at the same}} time the total oil trade has increased by 15 %. Two particular accidents have detracted from the tanker industry’s good record. The cause and effect of the Erika (1999) and Prestige (2002) incidents, with their heavy oil cargoes causing extensive pollution on European shores, have had major political, social and economic implications. <b>Single</b> <b>hull</b> <b>tankers</b> have been gradually being phased out according to the International Maritime Organization’s global regime for more than ten years, but last year Europe went beyond international regulations and implemented a unilateral accelerated phase-out, which has since led to the international phase-out being accelerated too. The control system for tankers has also been tightened up at the same time as the industry itself has taken initiatives to ensure that the structural integrity of tankers is maintained to good standards throughout the life of the ships. Despite the political and economic importance of these issues, some of the relevant new regulation still tends to be made before incidents have been properly investigated. Political pressure rather than proper risk analysis may determine which types of oil tanker pose the highest pollution risk, the relative safety of new tanker designs, or the most appropriate response to an evolving oil pollution incident. To address this issue rationally, the European Commission provided funding to the tune of € 2. 2 million for a 3 -year project entitled “Pollution Prevention and Control – Safe Transportation of Hazardous Goods by Tankers” (POP&C) under Framework Programme 6 (FP 6), which started earlier this year. The POP&C project proposes to deliver a framework and suitable tools for a methodological assessment of risk to be undertaken to provide a rational basis for making decisions pertaining the design, operation and regulation of oil tankers. Such support can be used to make more informed decisions, which will in turn contribute to reducing the likelihood and severity of future oil spills. The project brings together prime protagonists from the area of maritime safety in Europe. Deriving from the foregoing exciting developments, it is the purpose of this paper to present the main philosophy behind the POP&C project and to detail and explain the basics of the methodology to be adopted aiming to achieve the specific objectives outlined abov...|$|R
