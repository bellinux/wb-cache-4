40|$|Robot {{interaction}} with the surrounding environment is an important and newsworthy problem {{in the context of}} industrial and service robotics. Collision avoidance gives the robot the ability to avoid contacts with objects around it, but most of the industrial controls implementing collision avoidance checks only the robot Tool Center Point (TCP) over the objects in the cell, without taking into account the shape of the tool, mounted on the robot flange. In this paper a novel approach is proposed, based on an accurate 3 D simulation of the robotic cell. A distributed real time computing approach has been chosen to avoid any overloading of the robot controller. The simulator and the client application are implemented in a personal computer, connected via a TCP-IP socket to the robot controller, which hosts and manages the anti-collision policies, based on a proper <b>speed</b> <b>override</b> control. The real time effectiveness of the proposed approach has been confirmed by experimental tests, carried out for a real industrial setup in two different scenario...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle speed {{capacities}} {{are limited}} due to power supply construction. When using rotation type traction motors, their mechanical characteristics set the limits. Most common {{linear induction motor}} designs use pantographs, contact pads or wires that due to friction cannot run at extreme <b>speeds.</b> To <b>override</b> these limitations a new design of linear induction motor is proposed...|$|R

40|$|Developing an {{intelligent}} machine tool means to augment its level of automation. This augmentation, in turn, requires a machine controller {{able to perform}} actions and to implement attributes that are currently demanded to, and hold by, human operators. The present paper describes how this issue is being faced by a large Italian national research project, funded under the Industria 2015 initiative. Considering the case of milling machines, human operators are currently in charge of supervising the cutting process by acting on spindle <b>speed</b> and feed <b>override</b> controls in order to compensate for undesired process conditions (e. g. excessive vibration or power absorption) caused by a wrong choice of process parameters during {{the design of the}} part-program, by tool wear, by unexpected work material properties, or by machine tool dynamics. The first part of the paper proposes the architecture for an augmented-automation machine tool. Rather than revolutionizing the well-established architecture of a conventional machine tool, the concept is based on an additional controller that implements a supervision and optimization loop. This additional controller gets process state information from the CNC and from dedicated measurement systems, and closes a feedback action on the CNC as a human operator would do: by acting on feed and spindle <b>speed</b> <b>overrides.</b> The second part of the paper illustrates how the additional controller works: following the optimal control theory, it is based on a dynamic process model, a set of state variables (i. e. measurements), and a set of controls. Exploiting a simplified process model and efficient optimization algorithms, it performs a real-time optimization of the controls (i. e. the overrides named above) {{on the basis of a}} weighted multi-objective target function and a set of measurements taken from the cutting process (power, forces, accelerations). In particular, the target function takes into account the following objectives: cutting time, work-piece surface finish, tool wear rate and vibration mitigation in general. The third part of the paper details the strategies concerned with tool vibrations prediction, monitoring and mitigation, which are integrated into the optimization loop. A vibrations prediction module based on a simplified cutting process model allows the estimation of the vibration level and/or chatter occurrence during a pre-processing phase: thus, through the computation of the Stability Lobes Diagram along the tool path, the more stable spindle speeds can be identified. The pre-processing phase is complemented with an in-process chatter monitoring algorithm based on a recursive dynamic model identification: detecting real- time self-excited vibrations onset, and distinguishing them from forced vibrations, this module allows the controller to properly update the vibration estimation...|$|R
50|$|In {{general the}} GNT ZUB balises are placed {{slightly}} before the PZB inductor signalling an <b>override</b> <b>speed</b> information {{so that the}} traditional PZB on-board system is temporarily disabled at that PZB control point. In the first generation the ZUB and PZB balises were put {{next to each other}} using the same installation pattern on the outer side of the rails and connecting to the same line side signal. The second generation places the balise {{in the middle of the}} rail as any other Eurobalise.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} 3 D solid volumetric Finite Element models to surgery simulation. In particular it presents three new approaches {{to the problem of}} achieving real-time performance for these models. The simulation system we have developed is described and we demonstrate real-time deformation using the methods developed in the paper. Keywords: Virtual Surgery, Real-Time Deformation, Solid Volumetric Deformable Models, Virtual Reality, Finite Element Models. 1 Introduction <b>Speed</b> is <b>overriding</b> concern in Surgery Simulation and {{it is only in the}} last few years that real-time surgery simulation has become practically possible. The big problem in surgery simulation is modeling the deformation of solid volumetric objects, which often can have very complex forms, in real-time, ie. 15 - 20 frames/second. Since human organs and tissue have very complex elastic behaviour it has only been possible to model these using very simplistic models. Almost all the attempts have used s [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1843, and {{appointed}} a United States marshal by president Zachary Taylor in 1849. He was served as mayor of Louisville from April 26, 1852 until April 1855. The rules governing the office were confusing, and Speed was actually re-elected by popular vote each year of his term, yet never awarded an election certificate. Speed argued that his original election meant his term lasted until 1856, but a resolution in 1855 called for a new election that year. The election was won by Know-Nothing candidate John Barbee. Speed did not run in the election, believing he would remain mayor anyway, but Barbee was recognized as mayor by the city council, <b>overriding</b> <b>Speed's</b> veto. Speed appealed but ultimately lost at the Kentucky Supreme Court.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{measures}} for improved traffic safety {{need to be}} complemented by modern technologies {{in the struggle to}} reduce the consequences of traffic accidents all over the world. This thesis introduces the Loyal Speed Adaptation (LSA) function based on recent developments in the area of Intelligent Transport Sys-tems to support the vehicle drivers in not using inappropriate or excessive speeds, which {{have been found to be}} an important factor for causing serious and fatal accidents. The LSA function uses an active accelera-tor, which prevents the driver from exceeding legal speed limits by creating a force feed back in the pedal depending on local speed limits identified and supported by GPS. The thesis analyses the traffic safety and user acceptance effects of an introduction of LSA in built-up areas with speed limits 30, 50 and 70 km/h. The results show that considerable speed reductions were obtained when the LSA function was used. It was also possible to compare the effects between the field trial with 284 vehicles in Lund with an option of <b>overriding</b> <b>speed</b> limits and the LSA function. The result showed that the LSA function contributed to an improved traffic safety by reducing the number of fatal and seri-ous injuries by 5 - 8 % and 4 - 7 % more than with the system possible to override the limits. User acceptance increased after experience and the drivers appreciated the support the LSA function pro-vided them with. The conclusion is that the LSA function can be an important tool for improving the traffic safety in built-up areas and it can support the Swedish traffic safety program Vision Zero towards a society without health losses...|$|R
