40|$|In recent decades, Skylark (Alauda arvensis) {{populations in}} Europe have {{declined}} sharply due to agricultural intensification. Insufficient reproduction rates are one reason. Increased winter mortality {{may also be}} important, but studies outside the breeding season are scarce and mostly limited to the UK. We studied habitat selection of wintering Skylarks in an agricultural area in the Netherlands. We monitored Skylarks between November 2008 and March 2009 on 10 survey plots including 77 different arable fields and permanent grasslands and covering in total 480 ha. We simultaneously measured food availability, vegetation structure and field boundary characteristics. We also analysed 158 faecal pellets collected on potato and cereal <b>stubble</b> <b>fields</b> to relate Skylark diet to seasonal changes in food availability and foraging habitat. We show that cereal <b>stubble</b> <b>fields</b> larger than 4. 3 ha, surrounded by no or low boundary vegetation and a density of dietary seeds of more than 860 seeds m- 2, were most suitable for wintering Skylarks. Skylark group densities were low on permanent grasslands and on maize <b>stubble</b> <b>fields.</b> Densities of dietary seeds were highest in soils of potato <b>stubble</b> <b>fields</b> followed by cereal <b>stubble</b> <b>fields,</b> grasslands and maize <b>stubble</b> <b>fields.</b> Skylarks showed a strong preference for cereal grains, but their proportion in the diet fell sharply {{at the end of}} November, indicating that cereal grains were depleted and birds had to switch to less profitable food sources, such as weed seeds and leaves. We conclude that Skylarks wintering in agricultural landscapes possibly suffer from a lack of energy-rich food sources and only a few fields provide sufficient food. Conservation measures should strive to improve the wintering situation by creating food-rich habitats such as over-winter stubble with a rich layer of weeds on large fields and localised in open areas...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presents}} the results of studies carried out from 1994 to 2010 on changes in phytocenoses with Radiolion li-noidis species due to increased intensification of the farming process. The research material consisted of 136 phytosociolo-gical relevés taken from the same sites located in cereals, tu-ber crops/maize and <b>stubble</b> <b>fields.</b> The relevés were grouped based on three periods reflecting changes in farming system: period I (1994 – 1997) – traditional farming system; period II (2002 – 2004) – shift from traditional to intensive farming; pe-riod III (2008 – 2010) – intensive farming system. Communities with Radiolion linoidis continued to disappear over the whole study period due to farming intensification. The phytocenoses Spergulario-Illecebretum verticillati found in <b>stubble</b> <b>fields</b> and communities with Illecebrum verticillatum observed in cereals and tuber crops in period I were replaced with patches of Echi-nochloo-Setarietum in maize and <b>stubble</b> <b>fields</b> as well as the association Vicietum tetraspermae in cereals in period III.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the selection of <b>stubble</b> <b>fields</b> by farmland birds in winter, but none have shown whether provisioning of this key habitat positively influences national population trends for widespread farmland birds. We use two complementary extensive bird surveys undertaken at the same localities in summer and winter and show that the area of stubble in winter attracts increased numbers of several bird species of conservation concern. Moreover, for several farmland specialists, the availability of <b>stubble</b> <b>fields</b> in winter positively influenced the 10 year breeding population trend (1994 – 2003) whereas hedgerow bird species were less affected. For skylarks and yellowhammers, initially negative trends showed recovery with 10 – 20  ha of stubble per 1  km square. Thus, agri-environment schemes that promote retention of over-winter stubbles will attract birds locally and are capable of reversing current population declines if stubbles are available in sufficient quantity...|$|R

40|$|Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV), endemic in Africa, is {{believed}} to be spread by chrysomelid beetles, although the infections in a field often cannot be explained by the prevailing number of beetles. We show that the grass rat Arvicanthis niloticus, domestic cows (Bos spp.), and donkeys (Asinus spp.) are potent and efficient transmitters of RYMV. Spread of RYMV by rats was demonstrated in cage experiments wherein individual rats transmitted the virus from healthy to infected rice plants and confirmed in a field experiment. Experiments with cows and donkeys showed that they could transmit the virus in plots with healthy and infected plants and to plots with healthy plants. A high percentage of seedlings became infected when a cow grazed in a seedbed after being fed with infected rice plants. Transmission also was observed when cows were allowed to graze on the <b>stubble</b> of infected <b>fields.</b> The disease incidence increased at least fourfold over time to approximately 36 % of the plants infected in the experimental plots of two <b>stubble</b> <b>fields.</b> The results obtained in these <b>stubble</b> <b>fields</b> suggest that cattle-mediated spread will enhance the size of the virus load in the contraseason and the infection potential to infect the next crop...|$|R

60|$|First Kurt {{began to}} load bags of wheat, as they {{fell from the}} {{whirring}} combines, into the wagons. For his powerful arms a full bag, containing two bushels, was like a toy for a child. With a lift and a heave he threw a bag into a wagon. They were everywhere, these brown bags, dotting the <b>stubble</b> <b>field,</b> appearing {{as if by magic}} {{in the wake of the}} machines. They rolled off the platforms. This toil, because it was hard and heavy, held Kurt for an hour, but it could not satisfy his enormous hunger to make that whole harvest his own. He passed to pitching sheaves of wheat and then to driving in the wagons. From that he progressed to a seat on one of the immense combines, where he drove twenty-four horses. No driver there was any surer than Kurt of his aim with the little stones he threw to spur a lagging horse. Kurt had felt this when, as a boy, he had begged to be allowed to try his hand; he liked the shifty cloud of fragrant chaff, now and then blinding and choking him; and he liked the steady, rhythmic tramps of hooves and the roaring whir of the great complicated machine. It fascinated him to see the wide swath of nodding wheat tremble and sway and fall, and go sliding up into the inside of that grinding maw, and come out, straw and dust and chaff, and a slender stream of gold filling the bags.|$|E

40|$|Positive {{interactions}} between species can have important conservation implications, {{especially when the}} species associating are both vulnerable. We studied the habitat use of pin-tailed sandgrouses Pterocles alchata and their association with another vulnerable species, the little bustard Tetrax tetrax in agrarian pseudo-steppes of central Spain using radio-tracking. The occurrence of mixed-species flocks varied seasonally, being more frequent in winter (65 % of pin-tailed sandgrouse flocks). In this season, pin-tailed sandgrouses preferred <b>stubble</b> <b>fields</b> and fallows. Moreover, we found that habitat selection of pin-tailed sandgrouse depended on the association with little bustards in mixed-species flocks. When in mixed-species groups, sandgrouses changed their agrarian substrate preferences, and used <b>stubble</b> <b>fields</b> significantly more often than when in sandgrouse-only flocks. We also provide evidence that pin-tailed sandgrouse benefited from the anti-predator vigilance of little bustards, allowing sandgrouse to exploit new feeding grounds (<b>stubble</b> <b>fields)</b> {{that would otherwise be}} too risky to exploit. Our results indicate a close positive association between these two species, which are both declining in Europe, and we discuss implications for their management and conservation. We also recommend taking into account inter-specific positive interactions when designing conservation strategies for threatened species.

They were then about sixteen miles from Mistletoe, and about ten from Stamford where Lord Rufford's horses were standing. The distance from Stamford to Mistletoe was eight. Lord Rufford proposed that they should ride to Stamford and then go home in a hired carriage. There seemed indeed to be no other way of getting home without taking three tired horses fourteen miles out of their way. Arabella made no objection whatever to the arrangement. Lord Rufford did in truth make a slight effort,--the slightest possible,--to induce a third person to join their party. There was still something pulling at his coat-tail, so that there might yet be a chance of saving him from the precipice. But he failed. The tired horseman before whom the suggestion was casually thrown out, would have been delighted to accept it, instead of riding all the way to Mistletoe;--but he did not look upon it as made in earnest.

6000|$|Johnnie did {{not feel}} the prayer needless, for {{in spite of his}} {{eighteen}} year, he had all a country lad's dislike of being out alone in the dark; and to this was added the sense that {{it was a time when}} evil-minded people might be about, who would certainly assault and stop him if they guessed his errand. To meet his father would make it certain that he would be seized, abused, beaten, and turned back, with the reproach of being an unnatural son--turning against his father. Of this, however, there was little chance, as Dan Hewlett was pretty certain to be either in the [...] "Fox and Hounds" [...] or in the [...] "Blue Lion" [...] collecting partisans. And Johnnie, getting out through the back door, then by the untidy garden, and over the wall of the empty pig-stye, cut out into a <b>stubble</b> <b>field.</b> He was not afraid of his mother missing him till bedtime, as it was the wont of the youths--especially of those who had comfortless homes--to wander about in parties in the evening, bat-fowling sometimes, but often in an aimless sort of way, doing little bits of mischief, and seeking diversion, which they seldom found, unless there was any solitary figure to be shouted at and startled. His father was not likely to come in till after he was turned out of the public-house; so John strode, all unseen, across the field, and through the gateway into the next. He did think of the possibilities of bringing arrest and prosecution upon his father; but this did not greatly trouble him, for at this early period no regular measures of defence had been taken against the rioters; and as they went about disguised, and did not, as a rule, threaten life, they generally escaped scot-free.|$|E
