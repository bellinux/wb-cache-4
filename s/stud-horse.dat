2500|$|Interest in hold 'em {{outside of}} Nevada {{began to grow}} in the 1980s as well. Although California had legal card rooms {{offering}} draw poker, Texas hold 'em was deemed to be prohibited under a statute that made illegal the (now unheard of) game [...] "stud-horse". But in 1988 Texas hold 'em was declared legally distinct from <b>stud-horse</b> in Tibbetts v. Van De Kamp. Almost immediately card rooms across the state offered Texas hold 'em. [...] (It is often presumed that this decision ruled that hold 'em was a game of skill, but the distinction between skill and chance has never entered into California jurisprudence regarding poker.) [...] After a trip to Las Vegas, bookmakers Terry Rogers and Liam Flood introduced the game to European card players in the early 1980s.|$|E

There {{is some evidence}} that Ibrahim-Khalil (1763-1806), khan of the Karabakh khanate, possessed a horse herd numbering 3,000-4,000, mostly of the Karabakh breed. From the 19th century onwards this horse breed became increasingly popular in Europe. Thus, in one of the first big sales in 1823, an English company purchased 60 pure Karabakh mares from Mehdi-Kulu Khan, the last ruler of the Karabakh khanate. Karabakh numbers were initially hurt in 1826 during the Russo-Iranian war, but the breed remained intact. After Mehdi-Kulu Khan, his daughter Khurshidbanu Natavan took care of the breed. In a series of successes her Karabakh stallions received the highest awards in various exhibitions during the 19th century. As a result, the Karabakh horse Khan received a silver medal at an international show in Paris in 1867. At the second All-Russian exhibition in 1869, the Karabakh horse Meymun also won a silver medal, another stallion, Tokmak, won bronze. A third, Alyetmez (pictured), received a certificate and was made a <b>stud-horse</b> in the Russian Imperial stud.|$|E
