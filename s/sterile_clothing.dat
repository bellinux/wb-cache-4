40|$|Abstract — We {{address the}} need for robust {{detection}} of obstructed human features in complex environments, {{with a focus on}} intelligent surgical UIs. In our setup, real-time detection is used to find features without the help of local (spatial or temporal) information. Such a detector is used to validate, correct or reject the output of the visual feature tracking, which is locally more robust, but drifts over time. In Operating Rooms (OR), surgeons ’ faces and hands are typically obstructed by <b>sterile</b> <b>clothing</b> and tools, making statistical and/or feature-based feature detection approaches ineffective. We propose a new method for head and hands detection that relies on geometric information from disparity maps, locally refined by color processing. We have applied our method to a surgical mock-up scene, as well as to images gathered during real surgery. Running in a realtime, continuous detection loop, our detector successfully found more than 97 % of target features, with very few false positives (less than 0. 7 %).

40|$|The widest {{range of}} medical {{disposable}} from nonwoven textiles are: absorbent and hygiene products : (diapers, feminine care, incontinence) from the layered structures absorbent or impervious; use {{products such as}} hospital operating theaters <b>sterile</b> <b>clothing</b> (caps, gowns, masks, shoe coverings), materials for field operators, lab coats, packaging materials for hot or cold treatments, sterile materials (wipes, bandages, sterile bandages, etc.). Currently these materials, in their majority, are imported. This paper presents research done for getting, with the country equipment, disposable medical products from 40 g/m 2 nonwoven textile materials. The technology adopted for the purpose, in SC "Minet" S. A. Ramnicu Valcea, Romania consisted of the following steps:Carding - folding, the aggregate Spinnbau-Hergeth type, Germany, with major changes carding technology adjustment and folding, to obtain a fibrous layer with a mass per unit surface of about 40 - 50 g / m 2 and a width of 2, 1 m;Pre-heat consolidation by pre-heating required only to ensure product stability required minimal interphase transport to final consolidation. Final thermal consolidation of the fibrous layer by thermal calendering at a temperature of 110 °C and calenders cylinder speed of 2 m / min. The processing of the fiber by carding - folding and preliminary thermally consolidation and final by calendering. ...|$|E
