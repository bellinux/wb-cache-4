5|$|The {{orbit of}} Adrastea lies inside Jupiter's <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> radius (as does Metis's), {{and as a}} result, tidal forces are slowly causing its orbit to decay {{so that it will}} one day impact Jupiter.

5|$|From {{the surface}} of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear {{different}} from that of the Moon. Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours. Deimos, being only just outside <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> – where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation – rises as expected in the east but slowly. Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos, 2.7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer, as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.|$|E
50|$|Areosynchronous orbits are a {{class of}} <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbits</b> for {{artificial}} satellites around the planet Mars. As with all <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbits,</b> an areosynchronous orbit has an orbital period equal in length to Mars's sidereal day.

25|$|Neptune's regular moons Proteus and Larissa {{are thought}} to have passed through a 1:2 {{resonance}} a few hundred million years ago; the moons have drifted away from each other since then because Proteus is outside a <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> and Larissa is within one. Passage through the resonance is thought to have excited both moons' eccentricities to a degree that has not since been entirely damped out.|$|E
25|$|Orbital decay {{can occur}} due to tidal forces for objects below the <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> {{for the body}} they're {{orbiting}}. The gravity of the orbiting object raises tidal bulges in the primary, and since below the <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> the orbiting object is moving faster than the body's surface the bulges lag a short angle behind it. The gravity of the bulges is slightly off of the primary-satellite axis and thus has a component along the satellite's motion. The near bulge slows the object more than the far bulge speeds it up, {{and as a result}} the orbit decays. Conversely, the gravity of the satellite on the bulges applies torque on the primary and speeds up its rotation. Artificial satellites are too small to have an appreciable tidal effect on the planets they orbit, but several moons in the solar system are undergoing orbital decay by this mechanism. Mars' innermost moon Phobos is a prime example, and is expected to either impact Mars' surface or break up into a ring within 50 million years.|$|E
40|$|The LPA {{model is}} a three {{dimensional}} system of nonlinear difference equations that has found many applications in population dynamics and ecology. In this paper, we consider a special case of the model (a case that approximates that used in experimental bifurcation and chaos studies) and prove several theorems concerning the existence and stability of periodic cycles, invariant loops, and chaos. Key {{is the notion of}} <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbits</b> (i. e. orbits lying on the coordinate planes). The main result concerns the existence of an invariant loop of <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbits</b> that bifurcates, in a nongeneric way, from the trivial equilibrium. The geometry and dynamics of this invariant loop are characterized. Specifically, it is shown that the loop is a cycle chain consisting of <b>synchronous</b> heteroclinic <b>orbits</b> connecting the three temporal phases of a synchronous 3 -cycle. We also show that a period doubling route to chao...|$|R

40|$|Rendezvous {{techniques}} between synchronous satellites {{were found}} using a cotangential elliptic phasing (CEP) transfer. This transfer is a closed elliptic orbit which is cotangent to the <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbits</b> {{of the chase}} vehicle and target satellite. The cotangent point lies on the line of apsides of the transfer orbit which coincides with the line of intersection of the <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbits.</b> The rendezvous maneuvers accomplish plane changes and phase shifts simultaneously, and these maneuvers {{are found to be}} optimal when the plane change is split equally between the velocity increments. The CEP transfer can be extended to several revolutions for a further reduction of fuel usage. A set of synchronous satellites was used in a simulated mission. An optimal sequence for rendezvous among these satellites was established such that the total sum of velocity increments is within the realm of estimated 1980 technology...|$|R
25|$|Subsequent {{observations}} of Pluto {{determined that the}} bulge was due to a smaller accompanying body. The periodicity of the bulge corresponded to Pluto's rotation period, which was previously known from Pluto's light curve. This indicated a <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbit,</b> which strongly suggested that the bulge effect was real and not spurious. This resulted in reassessments of Pluto's size, mass, and other physical characteristics, because the calculated mass and albedo of the Pluto–Charon system had previously been attributed to Pluto alone.|$|E

[...] Lunan suggests that the planet from which the children were expelled may be trapped in <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> around its sun, presenting the conditions for life only in a narrow twilight zone between a fiercely hot surface and a frozen dark side.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium {{has also become}} important in determining whether an astronomical object is a planet, dwarf planet, or small Solar System body. According {{to the definition of}} planet adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, one defining characteristic of planets and dwarf planets is that they are objects that have sufficient gravity to overcome their own rigidity and assume hydrostatic equilibrium. Such a body will normally have the differentiated interior and geology of a world (a planemo), though near-hydrostatic bodies such as the proto-planet 4 Vesta may also be differentiated. Sometimes the equilibrium shape is an oblate spheroid, {{as is the case with}} Earth. However, in the cases of moons in <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbit,</b> nearly unidirectional tidal forces create a scalene ellipsoid. Also, the dwarf planet [...] is scalene due to its rapid rotation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{orbital motion}} of Phobos has been intensively studied, making it [...] "the best studied natural {{satellite}} in the Solar System" [...] {{in terms of}} orbits completed. [...] Its close orbit around Mars produces some unusual effects. With an altitude of , Phobos orbits Mars below the <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> radius, meaning that it moves around Mars faster than Mars itself rotates. Therefore, {{from the point of}} view of an observer on the surface of Mars, it rises in the west, moves comparatively rapidly across the sky (in 4 h 15 min or less) and sets in the east, approximately twice each Martian day (every 11 h 6 min). Because it is close to the surface and in an equatorial orbit, it cannot be seen above the horizon from latitudes greater than 70.4°. Its orbit is so low that its angular diameter, as seen by an observer on Mars, varies visibly with its position in the sky. Seen at the horizon, Phobos is about 0.14° wide; at zenith it is 0.20°, one-third as wide as the full Moon as seen from Earth. By comparison, the Sun has an apparent size of about 0.35° in the Martian sky. Phobos's phases, inasmuch as they can be observed from Mars, take 0.3191 days (Phobos's synodic period) to run their course, a mere 13 seconds longer than Phobos's sidereal period.|$|E

50|$|Planets {{close to}} their stars on {{circular}} orbits will tend to despin and become tidally locked.

For planets tidally locked to their stars, {{the distance from the}} planet at which the moon will be in a <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> around the planet is outside the Hill sphere of the planet. The Hill sphere of the planet is the region where its gravity dominates that of the star so it can hold on to its moons. Moons inside the <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> radius of a planet will spiral into the planet. Therefore, if the <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> is outside the Hill sphere, then all moons will spiral into the planet.

A body in a non-equatorial <b>synchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> will appear to oscillate north and south above a point on the planet's equator, whereas a body in an elliptical orbit will appear to oscillate eastward and westward.
