5000|$|The second {{leading cause}} of death on sailboats is {{directly}} attributed to the use of booms. [...] Booms can cause injuries directly, sweep people overboard, and their associated hardware and lines represent tripping hazards. On larger boats, sailors tend to stand on the boom to perform sail maintenance and install or take off <b>sail</b> <b>covers.</b> Falls from the boom onto the deck below occur. Even when stationary, booms represent a hazard since on most boats there is insufficient headroom to walk below them without ducking. According to a German study, [...] "boom strikes were {{the most common cause of}} sailing injury overall".|$|R

30|$|Many {{of these}} {{challenges}} are being {{addressed by the}} cited projects. Identifier generation is frequently related to naming, since legible and hashed names {{can be used as}} identifiers if they are unique in some scope [133]. In addition, self-certifying identifiers are preferred due to their intrinsic security properties. Akari, MobilityFirst, MOFI, and SAIL adopt this approach. However, the ID/Loc splitting should cover all inhabiting entities. In this regard, many approaches are limited. Akari, MobilityFirst, and MOFI limit the ID/Loc splitting support to the physical devices. ANA covers virtual network entities. But, only <b>SAIL</b> <b>covers</b> physical devices, virtual networking, services, and information ID/Loc support in the same architecture. SOA 4 ALL and CASCADAS does not support ID/Loc splitting.|$|R

25|$|The first {{practical}} windmills had sails that rotated in {{a horizontal}} plane, around a vertical axis. According to Ahmad Y. al-Hassan, these panemone windmills were invented in eastern Persia as {{recorded by the}} Persian geographer Estakhri in the ninth century. The authenticity of an earlier anecdote of a windmill involving the second caliph Umar (AD 634–644) is questioned {{on the grounds that}} it appears in a tenth-century document. Made of six to 12 <b>sails</b> <b>covered</b> in reed matting or cloth material, these windmills were used to grind grain or draw up water, and were quite different from the later European vertical windmills. Windmills were in widespread use across the Middle East and Central Asia, and later spread to China and India from there.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{practical}} windmills were {{in use in}} Sistan, {{a region}} in Iran and bordering Afghanistan, at least by the 9th century and possibly {{as early as the}} 7th century. These [...] "Panemone windmills" [...] were horizontal windmills, which had long vertical driveshafts with six to twelve rectangular <b>sails</b> <b>covered</b> in reed matting or cloth. These windmills were used to pump water, and in the gristmilling and sugarcane industries. The use of windmills became widespread use across the Middle East and Central Asia, and later spread to China and India. Vertical windmills were later used extensively in Northwestern Europe to grind flour beginning in the 1180s, and many examples still exist. By 1000 AD, windmills were used to pump seawater for salt-making in China and Sicily.|$|R

High altitude wind power is the focus of over 30 companies worldwide using tethered technology rather than ground-hugging compressive-towers. Oil is being saved by using wind for powering cargo ships by use of the mechanical energy converted from the wind's kinetic energy using very large kites.|$|R
