25|$|Mucocutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} is {{very difficult}} to treat. Treatment involves the use of pentavalent antimonial compounds, which are highly toxic (common side effects include thrombophlebitis, pancreatitis, cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity) and not very effective. For example, in one study, despite treatment with high doses of <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> for 28 days, only 30% of patients remained disease-free at 12 months follow-up. Even in those patients who achieve an apparent cure, as many as 19% will relapse. Several drug combinations with immunomodulators have been tested, for example, a combination of pentoxifylline (inhibitor of TNF-α) and a pentavalent antimonial at a high dose for 30 days in a small-scale (23 patients) randomised placebo-controlled study from Brazil achieved cure rates of 90% and reduced time to cure, a result that should be interpreted cautiously in light of inherent limitations of small-scale studies. In an earlier small-scale (12 patients) study, addition of imiquimod showed promising results which need yet to be confirmed in larger trials.|$|E
2500|$|Kala-azar, {{also known}} as visceral leishmaniasis, {{has been one of}} the major health {{problems}} in Sudan. After the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between North and Southern Sudan on 9 January 2005, the increase in stability within the region helped further efforts in healthcare delivery. Médicins sans Frontières tested a combination of <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> and paromomycin, which would reduce treatment duration (from 30 to 17 days) and cost in 2008. In March 2010, MSF set up its first Kala-Azar treatment centre in Eastern Sudan, providing free treatment for this otherwise deadly disease. If left untreated, there is a fatality rate of 99% within 1–4 months of infection. Since the treatment centre was set up, MSF has cured more than 27,000 Kala-Azar patients with a success rate of approximately 90–95%. There are plans to open an additional Kala-Azar treatment centre in Malakal, Southern Sudan to cope with the overwhelming number of patients that are seeking treatment. MSF has been providing necessary medical supplies to hospitals and training Sudanese health professionals to help them deal with Kala-Azar. MSF, Sudanese Ministry of Health and other national and international institutions are combining efforts to improve on the treatment and diagnosis of Kala-Azar. Research on its cures and vaccines are currently being conducted. [...] In December 2010, South Sudan was hit with the worst outbreak of Kala-Azar in eight years.|$|E
50|$|Side {{effects are}} common and include loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pains, headache, and feeling tired.

50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> is {{exceedingly}} toxic to veins.

50|$|The {{chemical}} structure of <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> is somewhat ambiguous, {{and the structure}} shown above is idealized.

50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Pentostam among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat leishmaniasis. This includes leishmaniasis of the cutaneous, visceral, and mucosal types. Some combination of miltefosine, paramycin and liposomal amphotericin B, however, may be recommended due to issues with resistance. It is given by injection.|$|E
50|$|The dose of <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> is by slow {{intravenous}} infusion (at {{least five}} minutes with cardiac monitoring).

50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> {{has been}} studied as early as 1937 {{and has been in}} medical use since the 1940s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale price in the developing world is 9.66 USD per vial. This gives the cost for a course of treatment at between 12 and 56 USD.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> is poorly understood, but {{is thought to}} stem from the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis via a reduction in available ATP and GTP, likely secondary to inhibition of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis. Bermann et al. studied the effects of stibogluconate on Leishmaniasis mexicana and demonstrated a 56-65% reduction in incorporation of a label into purine nucleoside triphosphates (ATP and GTP) {{as well as between}} a 34-60% increase of label incorporation into purine nucleoside mono and di phosphates (AMP, GMP, ADP, and GDP) following 4 hour exposure to stibogluconate.|$|E
50|$|SSG&PM, a <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> plus {{paromomycin}} combination therapy, is a shorter-course, cost-efficient treatment option against Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in East Africa available since 2010.

50|$|The first {{treatment}} application against trypanosomiasis {{was tested}} in 1906, and the compound's use to treat other tropical diseases was researched. The treatment of leishmania with antimony potassium tartrate started in 1913. After {{the introduction of}} antimony (V) containing complexes like <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> and meglumine antimoniate, the use of antimony potassium tartrate was phased out. After British physician John Brian Christopherson's discovery in 1918 that antimony potassium tartrate could cure schistosomiasis, the antimonial drugs became widely used. However, the injection of antimony potassium tartrate had severe side effects such as Adams-Stokes syndrome and therefore alternative substances were under investigation. With the introduction and subsequent larger use of praziquantel in the 1970s, the use of antimony based treatments fell out of use.|$|E

50|$|In {{the same}} year as the {{discovery}} of the anticancer property, miltefosine was reported by S. L. Croft and his team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as having antileishmanial effect as well. The compound was effective against Leishmania donovani amastigotes in cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages at a dose of 12.8 mg/kg/day in a five-day course. However, priority was given {{to the development of the}} compound for cutaneous metastases of breast cancer. In 1992 a new research was reported in which the compound was highly effective in mouse against different life cycle stages of different Leishmania species, and in fact, more potent than the conventional <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> therapy by a factor of more than 600. Results of the first clinical trial in humans were reported from Indian patients with chronic leishmaniasis with high degree of success and safety. This promising development promulgated a unique public-private partnership collaboration between ASTA Medica (later Zentaris GmbH), the WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, and the Government of India. Eventually, several successful Phase II and III trials led to the approval of miltefosine in 2002 as the first and only oral drug for leishmaniasis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate,</b> a {{pentavalent}} antimony derivative {{produced by}} the reaction of stibonic and gluconic acids, is the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} leishmaniasis. It has been reported to be a complex mixture rather than a single compound. We separated <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> into 12 fractions by anion-exchange chromatography. One fraction accounted for virtually all the leishmanicidal activity of the fractionated material against Leishmania panamensis promastigotes, with a 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 12 micrograms of Sb per ml; that of unfractionated <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> was 154 micrograms of Sb per ml. Further analysis of this active fraction revealed that a major component was m-chlorocresol, which had been included in the <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> formulation as a preservative. The IC 50 of pure m-chlorocresol was 1. 6 micrograms/ml, a concentration equivalent to that present in unfractionated <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> at a concentration of 160 micrograms of Sb per ml. After ether extraction to remove m-chlorocresol, the IC 50 of <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> was > 4, 000 micrograms of Sb per ml. In contrast, when L. panamensis amastigotes were grown in macrophages, the IC 50 of ether-extracted <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> was 10. 3 micrograms of Sb per ml. The 12 fractions of ether-extracted <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> obtained by anion-exchange chromatography had IC 50 s of 10. 1 to 15. 4 micrograms of Sb per ml.

Three successive studies of 96 patients each were originally planned with aminosidine administered at 12, 6 and 3 mg/kg/d, respectively. For each aminosidine dosage, patients were randomly assigned to receive <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> at 20, 10 or 5 mg/kg/d of antimony. Ninety-six patients were enrolled and assigned aminosidine 12 mg/kg/d as scheduled. In the subsequent study with aminosidine at 6 mg/kg/d, the trial was interrupted after 40 patients had entered owing to inadequacy of the treatment. With aminosidine 12 mg/kg/d the success rates with <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> at 20, 10 and 5 mg/kg/d were 88 %, 71 % and 72 %, respectively and did not differ significantly.

We present a series of pregnant women with VL treated with either <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> or liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome), or both, in eastern Sudan over 16 months. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of all pregnant VL patients treated in the Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) Um el Kher centre between January 2004 and April 2005. We diagnosed VL with laboratory confirmation of clinical suspects, and recorded the outcomes of treatment for pregnant women and their foetuses. We carried out a manual search of relevant publications and a systematic search of the literature in the MEDLINE database. RESULTS: We treated 23 women with <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate,</b> 4 with AmBisome and <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> and 12 with AmBisome alone. There were 13 (57 %) spontaneous abortions in the <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> monotherapy group, and none in either of the other two groups. All spontaneous abortions occurred in the first two trimesters. All patients, except one in the <b>sodium</b> <b>stibogluconate</b> group who defaulted, were discharged as cured in good clinical condition.
