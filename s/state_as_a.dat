5|$|Arizona {{has been}} {{affected}} by hurricanes on numerous occasions. Usually, these storms originate in the eastern Pacific Ocean, make landfall in the Mexican states of Baja California or Sonora, and dissipate before crossing into the United States.

However, approximately every five years, a tropical cyclone retains sufficient strength to enter the <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm or a tropical depression. Arizonans can expect indirect flash floods caused by the remnants of tropical cyclones to occur about every two years.|$|E
