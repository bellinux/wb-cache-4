Rice husk filled high-density polyethylene was used as the raw material. Solid and hollow designs (A 001 and A 002) were created to compare {{the pros and cons of}} each design. The investigations were carried out on flowing, packing, cooling and costing of injection moulded window frame. At the end of the analysis, the most feasible design was selected to be further undergone stress analysis according to BS EN 14608 : 2004 and BS EN 14609 : 2004. Eventually, the mechanical properties were classified according to BS EN 13115 : 2001. The actual processing conditions of rice husk composite were approximated to softwood at Cross-WLF viscosity model due to unavailability of rice husk plastic composite (RHPC) rheology property. RHPC melt is generally shear thinning, meanings that the viscosity decreases with increasing of shear rates. From the analysis, window frame with hollow design is preferable, since hollow design has advantage of filling, packing, and cooling properties. The hollow design also costs less than solid design of window frame. However, high injection pressure and clamping tonnage are unfavourable for hollow design. A 002 hollow design was selected as the most feasible window frame to be fabricated. Stress analysis was done to classify the window frame. The analyses were carried out to determine racking and <b>static</b> <b>torsion</b> <b>resistance.</b> A 002 window frame mechanical strength is classified as Class 2 according to BS EN 13115 : 2001...|$|E

Methods: The new system was submitted to biomechanical torsion assays. Two types of analysis were performed: maximum torque of manual insertion of the screws into bovine bone; destructive assays of torsion of the system using an INSTRON 55 MT machine. The same tests were also performed on a control group, using a commercially available interference screw coupling system (Acufex (R)). Results: In the tests on manual insertion of screws in bovine femurs, the average values found with a digital torque meter were 1. 958 N/m for Acufex (R) and 2. 563 N/m for FMRP.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose was}} to assess intra- and post-saccadic torsion in {{superior}} oblique palsy (SOP) patients {{and the effect of}} surgery on torsion. METHODS: Eleven patients with a presumed congenital SOP and five with acquired SOP performed 10 degrees vertical saccades over a range of +/- 20 degrees. Eye movements were recorded with dual search coils. Dynamic torsion was calculated by subtracting the expected change in torsion during the saccade (based upon <b>static</b> <b>torsion</b> before and after the saccade) from the maximum intrasaccadic torsion. Eight healthy subjects were controls. We also examined the effects of surgery on dynamic torsion and the orientation of Listing's plane in patients with congenital SOP who were operated on either by weakening of the inferior oblique muscle on the affected eye (n= 5), by recession of the inferior rectus muscle on the normal eye (n= 4) or by both procedures (n= 2). Postoperative recordings were obtained at least 1 month after surgery. RESULTS: Patients with congenital and acquired SOP showed an increased dynamic extorsion, primarily during downward saccades. Following a recession of the inferior oblique muscle in congenital SOP patients, half showed significant decreases in extorsion (up to 1. 0 degrees) during downward saccades by the affected eye. Following surgery all showed a temporal rotation of Listing's plane (up to 15 degrees for primary position). CONCLUSION: Patients with a SOP show a characteristic pattern of dynamic torsion during vertical saccades differing from normals. Recession of the inferior oblique muscle leads to rotation of Listing's plane in all congenital SOP patients and causes large changes in dynamic torsion in a subgroup of them, perhaps reflecting the heterogeneity of congenital SOP...|$|R
