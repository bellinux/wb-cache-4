5|$|Around {{this time}} Henry Tippett decided {{to live in}} France, and the house in Wetherden was sold. The 15-year-old Michael and his brother Peter {{remained}} at school in England, travelling to France for their holidays. Michael found Stamford much more congenial than Fettes, and developed both academically and musically. He found an inspiring piano teacher in Frances Tinkler, who {{introduced him to the}} music of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and Chopin. Sargent had maintained his connection with the <b>school,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> present when Tippett and another boy played a C minor Concerto for Two Harpsichords by Bach on pianos with a local string orchestra. Tippett sang in the chorus when Sargent directed a local performance of Robert Planquette's operetta Les Cloches de Corneville.

5|$|Encouraged by {{the orphanage}} staff {{who thought that}} Monroe would be happier living in a family, Grace became her legal {{guardian}} in 1936, although she {{was not able to}} take her out of the orphanage until the summer of 1937. Monroe's second stay with the Goddards lasted only a few months, as Doc molested her. After staying with various of her and Grace's relatives and friends in Los Angeles and Compton, Monroe found a more permanent home in September 1938, when she began living with Grace's aunt, Ana Atchinson Lower, in the Sawtelle district. She was enrolled in Emerson Junior High <b>School</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> taken to weekly Christian Science services with Lower. While otherwise a mediocre student, Monroe excelled in writing and contributed to the school's newspaper. Due to the elderly Lower's health issues, Monroe returned to live with the Goddards in Van Nuys in either late 1940 or early 1941. After graduating from Emerson, she began attending Van Nuys High School.|$|E
5|$|For a while, he was {{uncertain}} {{whether he would}} attend college, but ultimately he applied and was accepted to Hampden–Sydney College in Virginia, where a friend had also enrolled. Arriving in 1982, he continued to participate in plays while studying mainly philosophy. He found the curriculum rigorous, but was more focused {{than he had been}} in high <b>school</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> able to apply himself to his studies. Despite the lack of a significant theater community at Hampden–Sydney, Colbert's interest in acting escalated during this time. After two years, he transferred in 1984 to Northwestern University as a theater major to study performance, emboldened by the realization that he loved performing, even when no one was coming to shows. He graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Her {{mother died}} from {{diphtheria}} on December 7, 1892, and Elliott Jr. {{died of the}} same disease the following May.

Eleanor's childhood losses left her prone to depression throughout her life. Her brother Hall later suffered from alcoholism. Before her father died, he implored her {{to act as a}} mother towards Hall, and it was a request she made good upon for the rest of Hall's life. Eleanor doted on Hall, and when he enrolled at Groton School in 1907, she accompanied him as a chaperone. While he was attending Groton, she wrote him almost daily, but always felt a touch of guilt that Hall had not had a fuller childhood. She took pleasure in Hall's brilliant performance at <b>school,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> proud of his many academic accomplishments, which included a master's degree in engineering from Harvard.|$|E
