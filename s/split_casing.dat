40|$|A {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to investigate the}} practicality of increasing rotor critical speeds by changes in manufacturing method. The technique would be to build a pump with an all laser welded shaft and case; such unit to be opened by laser cutting and rebuilt by rewelding the same surface. Use of a <b>split</b> <b>casing,</b> common in industry, would permit assembly of the rotor outside the case. A team was formed to perform the study; however, {{the work of the}} team was severely restricted by conflict with higher priority tasks. No manpower was available to evaluate alternate configurations. Thus, much of the synergetic effects of cohesive design modification was lost. Although very limited results were achieved, nothing was found to indicate that the method is not worth further investigation...|$|E
40|$|A two-stage, highly-loaded fan was {{designed}} to deliver an overall pressure ratio of 2. 8 with an adiabatic efficiency of 83. 9 percent. At the first rotor inlet, design flow per unit annulus area is 42 lbm/sec/sq ft (205 kg/sec/sq m), hub/tip ratio is 0. 4 with a tip diameter of 31 inches (0. 787 m), and design tip speed is 1450 ft/sec (441. 96 m/sec). Other features include use of multiple-circular-arc airfoils, resettable stators, and <b>split</b> <b>casings</b> over the rotor tip sections for casing treatment tests...|$|R
5000|$|Casing: <b>Split</b> outer <b>casing</b> {{halves of}} cast contain the wear liners and provide high {{operation}} pressure capabilities. The casing shape is generally of semi-volute or concentric, efficiencies {{of which are}} {{less than that of}} the volute type.|$|R
50|$|On January 17, 1997, a Delta II (Delta 241) {{exploded}} due to {{a catastrophic}} failure in a GEM-40. The failure triggered the launch vehicle's self-destruct function 13 seconds after ignition. An Air Force investigation determined that the motor's casing had been damaged prior to launch, resulting in the <b>casing</b> <b>splitting</b> open soon after ignition.|$|R
5000|$|All Titan II/III/IV {{vehicles}} {{contained a}} special range safety system {{known as the}} Inadvertent Separation Destruction System (ISDS) that would activate and destroy the first stage {{if there was a}} premature second stage separation. Titans that carried SRBs (Titan IIIC, IIID, 34D, and IV) had a second ISDS that consisted of several lanyards attached to the SRBs that would trigger and automatically destroy them if they prematurely separated from the core, said [...] "destruction" [...] consisting mainly of <b>splitting</b> the <b>casings</b> open to release the pressure inside and terminate thrust. The ISDS would end up being used a few times over the Titan's career.|$|R
40|$|A {{two-stage}} fan {{was designed}} to reduce noise 20 db below current requirements. The first-stage rotor has a design tip speed of 365. 8 m/sec and a hub/tip ratio of 0. 4. The fan {{was designed to}} deliver a pressure ratio of 1. 9 with an adiabatic efficiency of 85. 3 percent at a specific inlet corrected flow of 209. 2 kg/sec/sq m. Noise reduction devices include acoustically treated casing walls, a flowpath exit acoustic splitter, a translating centerbody sonic inlet device, widely spaced blade rows, and the proper ratio of blades and vanes. Multiple-circular-arc rotor airfoils, resettable stators, <b>split</b> outer <b>casings,</b> and capability to go to close blade-row spacing are also included...|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 129 What I {{decided to}} {{accomplish}} in this tutorial is to examine {{a few of the}} myths that pertain to centrifugal pump construction and to try to shed some light on their origins as well as on their validity. More specifically, I have chosen six different details of construction wherein major differences in concept have evolved over the years, namely: *The use of double vs single wearing rings * An improved wearing ring built on a false premise * Extra deep stuffing boxes * Axially vs radially <b>split</b> inner <b>casings</b> of double-casing multistage pumps * The balancing of the axial thrust of multistage pumps * Differences of philosophy in the rotor design of multistage pumps...|$|R
50|$|The {{solid rocket}} booster debris had {{no signs of}} {{explosion}} (other than the Range Safety charges <b>splitting</b> the <b>casings</b> open), or propellant debonding/cracking. There was no question about the RSO manually destroying the SRBs following vehicle breakup, so {{the idea of the}} destruct charges accidentally detonating was ruled out. Premature separation of the SRBs from the stack or inadvertent activation of the recovery system was also considered, but telemetry data quickly disproved that idea. Nor was there any evidence of in-flight structural failure since visual and telemetry evidence showed that the SRBs remained structurally intact up to and beyond vehicle breakup. The aft field joint on the right SRB did show extensive burn damage.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the great}} weight {{efficiency}} of white phosphorus smoke, it is particularly suited for applications where weight is highly restricted, such as hand grenades and mortar bombs. An additional advantage for hand smoke grenades—which {{are more likely to}} be used in an emergency—is that the WP smoke clouds form in a fraction of a second. Because WP is also pyrophoric, most munitions of this type have a simple burster charge to <b>split</b> open the <b>casing</b> and spray fragments of WP through the air, where they ignite spontaneously and leave a trail of rapidly thickening smoke behind each particle. The appearance of this cloud forming is easily recognised; one sees a shower of burning particles spraying outward, followed closely by distinctive streamers of white smoke, which rapidly coalesce into a fluffy, very pure white cloud (unless illuminated by a coloured light source).|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, PC Lesley May, {{who is on}} {{indefinite}} {{sick leave}} after suffered a magical attack that resulted in catastrophic facial injuries (see Rivers of London) returns to The Folly after her latest round of reconstructive surgery still wearing a therapeutic mask but now able to speak without using a speech synthesiser. Peter and Lesley receive instruction from Nightingale {{in the art of}} magical staff-making: splitting open his walking stick (dubbed a 'cad walloper' by the revenant Mister Punch). Using a hammer and chisel to <b>split</b> the wooden <b>casing</b> Nightingale reveals a pattern-welded iron core that he explains can, correctly forged using magic, acts as a magical reservoir that enables a practitioner to wield magical power at otherwise dangerous levels while avoiding 'thaumaturgical degradation' (inevitable severe and irreversible brain damage resulting from over-use of magic, a condition Peter has irreverently dubbed cauliflower brain syndrome - after cauliflower ear).|$|R
40|$|The {{year was}} 1969, a momentous {{year for the}} nation and the world. At the movie theater, Easy Rider and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were playing. A new {{generation}} converged on Yasgur’s farm in New York for Woodstock. From the moon, we heard “Houston …Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed. ” In the fall, the Amazin’ Mets won the World Series, and in Vietnam, the war raged on. Early in that same year, a new attitude toward the environment was born in Santa Barbara, California. At 10 : 45 am on Tuesday morning, January 28, 1969, about five miles off the coast from the aptly named small coastal community of Summerland, all hell broke loose. Like most catastrophes, there was not one point of failure but many acting in concert. The problems began on an offshore drilling rig operated by Union Oil called platform Alpha, where pipe was being extracted from a 3, 500 foot deep well. The pressure difference created by the extraction of the pipe was not sufficiently compensated for by the pumping of drilling mud back down the well, which caused a disastrous pressure increase. As the pressure built up and started to strain the casing on {{the upper part of the}} well, an emergency attempt was made to cap it, but this action only succeeded in further increasing the pressure inside the well. The consequence was that under extreme pressure a burst of natural gas blew out all of the drilling mud, <b>split</b> the <b>casing</b> and caused cracks to form in the seafloor surrounding the well. A simple solution to the problem was now impossible; due to the immense pressure involved and the large volume of oil and natural gas being released a “blowout ” occurred and the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill was under way...|$|R
40|$|The Rapid Access Ice Drill (RAID) is {{designed}} for subsurface scientific investigations in Antarctica. Its objectives are to drill rapidly through ice, to core samples of the transition zone and bedrock, and to leave behind a borehole observatory. These objectives required the engineering and fabrication of an entirely new drilling system that included a modified mining-style coring rig, a unique fluid circulation system, a rod skid, a power unit, and a workshop with areas for the storage of supplies and consumables. An important milestone in fabrication of the RAID was {{the construction of a}} North American Test (NAT) facility where we were able to test drilling and fluid processing functions in an environment that is {{as close as possible to}} that expected in Antarctica. Our criteria for site selection was that the area should be cold during the winter months, be located in an area of low heat flow, and be at relatively high elevation. We selected a site for the facility near Bear Lake, Utah, USA. The general design of the NAT well (NAT- 1) started with a 27. 3  cm (10. 75  in.) outer casing cemented in a 152  m deep hole. Within that casing, we hung a 14  cm (5. 5  in.) casing string, and, within that casing, a column of ice was formed. The annulus between the 14 and 27. 3  cm casings provided the path for circulation of a refrigerant. After in-depth study, we chose to use liquid CO 2 to cool the hole. In order to minimize the likelihood of the <b>casing</b> <b>splitting</b> due to the volume increase associated with freezing water, the hole was first cooled and then ice was formed in increments from the bottom upward. First, ice cubes were placed in the inner liner and then water was added. Using this method, a column of ice was incrementally prepared for drilling tests. The drilling tests successfully demonstrated the functioning of the RAID system. Reproducing such a facility for testing of other ice drilling systems could be advantageous to other research programs in the future...|$|R
