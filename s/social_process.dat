5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} <b>social</b> <b>process</b> and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication is the {{transmission}} of signs, signals, messages, words, writings, images and sounds or information of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems. Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology. It is transmitted either electrically over physical media, such as cables, or via electromagnetic radiation. Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing. Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the <b>social</b> <b>process</b> of information exchange, the term, telecommunications, is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies.|$|E

Project Managers were interviewed to understand how they experience the <b>social</b> <b>processes</b> taking place in the project environment as well as how they handle and approach these social interactions. The above methodology used in this exploratory case study is specifically used to develop a justification for enlarging the existing methodological Project Management Bodies of Knowledge (PMBOK) and the Life Cycle processes applicable to System Engineering to include <b>Social</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{controversy}} {{about the existence}} of cultic brainwashing {{has become one of the}} most polarizing issues among cult followers, academic researchers of cults, and cult critics. Parties disagree {{about the existence of}} a <b>social</b> <b>process</b> attempting coercive influence, and also disagree about the existence of the social outcome—that people become influenced against their will.|$|E
25|$|Other constructivist {{scholars}} {{agree with}} this and emphasize that individuals make meanings through the interactions {{with each other and}} with the environment they live in. Knowledge is thus a product of humans and is socially and culturally constructed (Ernest 1991; Prawat and Floden 1994). McMahon (1997) agrees that learning is a <b>social</b> <b>process.</b> He further states that learning is not a process that only takes place inside our minds, nor is it a passive development of our behaviors that is shaped by external forces and that meaningful learning occurs when individuals are engaged in social activities.|$|E
25|$|Qutb's written {{works are}} still widely {{available}} {{and have been}} translated into many Western languages. His best known work is Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq (Milestones), {{but the majority of}} Qutb's theory can be found in his Qur'anic commentary Fi zilal al-Qur'an (In the Shade of the Quran). This 30-volume work is noteworthy for its innovative method of interpretation, borrowing heavily from the literary analysis of Amin al-Khuli, while retaining some structural features of classical commentaries (for example, the practice of progressing from the first sura to the last). For Qutb, the Qur'an was seen as the final arbiter in all matters relating to faith, while his main goal in writing the book, In the Shade of the Qur’an, was to restore the centrality of faith in the consciousness and imagination of Muslims, and to kindle a cognitive revolution that would bring about a political and <b>social</b> <b>process</b> that will lead to the renewal of the Islamic tradition.|$|E

25|$|In France {{as in most}} industrialised European capitals, slums were {{widespread}} in Paris and other urban areas in the 19th century, many of which continued through {{first half of the}} 20th century. The first cholera epidemic of 1832 triggered a political debate, and Louis René Villermé study of various arrondissements of Paris demonstrated the differences and connection between slums, poverty and poor health. Melun Law first passed in 1849 and revised in 1851, followed by establishment of Paris Commission on Unhealthful Dwellings in 1852 began the <b>social</b> <b>process</b> of identifying the worst housing inside slums, but did not remove or replace slums. After World War II, French people started mass migration from rural to urban areas of France. This demographic and economic trend rapidly raised rents of existing housing as well as expanded slums. French government passed laws to block increase in the rent of housing, which inadvertently made many housing projects unprofitable and increased slums. In 1950, France launched its Habitation à Loyer Modéré initiative to finance and build public housing and remove slums, managed by techniciens – urban technocrats., and financed by Livret A – a tax free savings account for French public.|$|E
500|$|For Kuhn, {{the choice}} of {{paradigm}} was sustained by rational processes, but not ultimately determined by them. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more [...] "portraits" [...] against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a <b>social</b> <b>process</b> {{as much as a}} logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of relativism. According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, {{the choice of}} a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm.|$|E

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>processes</b> {{are key to}} {{navigating}} the world, and investigating their underlying mecha-nisms and cognitive architecture can aid in understanding disease states such as schizo-phrenia, where <b>social</b> <b>processes</b> are highly impacted. Evidence suggests that <b>social</b> <b>processes</b> are impaired in individuals at ultra high-risk {{for the development of}} psychosis (UHR). Understanding these phenomena in UHR youth may clarify disease etiology and <b>social</b> <b>processes</b> in a period that is characterized by significantly fewer confounds than schizophrenia. Furthermore, understanding social processing deficits in this population will help explain these processes in healthy individuals. The current study examined resting state connectivity of the salience (SN) and default mode networks (DMN) in association with facial emotion recognition (FER), an integral aspect of <b>social</b> <b>processes,</b> as well as broader social functioning (SF) in UHR individuals and healthy controls. Consistent with the existing literature, UHR youth were impaired in FER and SF when compared with controls. In the UHR group, we found increased connectivity between the SN and the medial prefron-tal cortex, an area of the DMN relative to controls. In UHR youth, the DMN exhibited bot...|$|R

2500|$|A common {{misinterpretation}} of paradigms is {{the belief}} that the discovery of paradigm shifts and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for relativism: the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal.

40|$|Well {{implemented}} {{human resource}} practice (HRP) {{is linked to}} increased performance, innovation, and the well-being of both managers and employees. In the literature, {{a distinction between the}} hard and the soft HRM-models is drawn: the hard model focuses on employees as a cost, whereas the soft HRM-model treats them as a potential Nielsen (2008 a). However, {{little is known about the}} informal aspects of HRP and which <b>social</b> <b>processes</b> actually lead to implementation success or failure. The purpose of this paper is to develop a concept of <b>social</b> <b>processes</b> between managers and employees that can increase the implementation and quality of HR-performance Two studies of HRP within two manufacturing companies are used to illustrate the pros and cons of this new theoretical concept from a performance perspective. Involvement, commitment, and competence development are identified as key aspects of the quality of HRP. Moreover, a good psychological working environment and systematic priority of HRP are essential contextual factors that can enable or hinder <b>social</b> <b>processes.</b> Otherwise, production pressure and power relations between managers and employees can hinder the implementation of the new concept. The concept of <b>social</b> <b>processes</b> can help HRP to contribute on <b>social</b> <b>processes</b> between managers and employees as important aspects of quality in work with human resources. However, the influence of team organization and the <b>social</b> <b>processes</b> between employees needs to be explored further...|$|R

Only in England and in the eighties did the expanding propositions of Socialism come under the influence of men essentially administrative.

He saw the economic process with a perfect lucidity, practically he foretold the consolidation of the Trusts, and his statement of the necessary development of an entirely propertyless working-class with an intensifying class consciousness is a magnificent generalization. He saw clearly up to that opposition of the many and the few, and then his vision failed because his experience and interests failed. There was to be a class war, and numbers schooled to discipline by industrial organization were to win.|$|E
