The ships had a complement of 16officers and 293enlisted men. They carried several smaller vessels, including one picket boat, one barge, and two dinghies. The German Navy regarded the ships as excellent sea boats, having gentle motion. The ships were highly maneuverable and had a tight turning radius, and only lost slight speed in a head sea. In hard turns, they lost up to sixty percent speed. They were very , however.|$|E

Her hull was finished, and a <b>superstructure</b> <b>deck,</b> bridge deck and conning tower had been fitted, along with a light signal mast directly aft of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and bridge wings. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.|$|E

5|$|Both German ships {{initially}} concentrated {{their fire}} on Hood and destroyed her with salvoes of 8- and 15-inch shells. An 8-inch shell hit the boat deck and struck a ready service locker for the UP rocket projectors, and a fire blazed {{high above the}} first <b>superstructure</b> <b>deck.</b> At 05:58 at a range of , the force commander ordered a turn of 20 degrees to port to open the range and bring the full battery of the British ships to bear on Bismarck. As the turn began, Bismarck straddled Hood with her third and fourth four-gun salvoes and at 06:01 the fifth salvo hit her, causing a large explosion. Flames shot up near Hoods masts, then an orange-coloured fireball and an enormous smoke cloud obliterated the ship. On Prince of Wales, it seemed that Hood collapsed amidships, and the bow and stern could be seen rising as she rapidly settled. Prince of Wales made a sharp starboard turn to avoid hitting the debris {{and in doing so}} further closed the range between her and the German ships. In the four-minute action, Hood, the largest battlecruiser in the world, had been sunk. 1,419 officers and men were killed. Only three men survived.|$|E

500|$|Later on {{the first}} day of the battle, Hipper's badly damaged battlecruisers were being engaged by their British rivals. Schleswig-Holstein and the other {{so-called}} [...] "five-minute ships" [...] came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. These ships were very briefly engaged, owing in large part to the poor visibility. The visibility was so bad, the gunners aboard Schleswig-Holstein could not make out a target, and she did not fire her main guns. At 21:35 a heavy caliber shell struck the ship on the port-side, punching a hole approximately 40cm (16in) wide before exploding against the inner casemate armor. It tore apart [...] of the <b>superstructure</b> <b>deck</b> and disabled one of the port side casemate guns. Three men were killed and nine were wounded. Admiral Mauve halted the fight against the much more powerful battlecruisers and ordered an 8-point turn to starboard.|$|E
5000|$|Since ships {{would be}} {{required}} to fight [...] "end-on" [...] when attempting to ram (or to rush into a pell-mell battle), many ships were designed to give as much fire ahead (and sometimes astern) as on the broadside.

40|$|Economic reasons have {{motivated}} shipyards to {{look for}} new lightweight solutions. Going below the 5 -mm plate thickness limit set by the classification societies for the <b>superstructure</b> <b>decks</b> of cruise ships could be one way to achieve the goal. However, the fatigue design of such large thin welded structures is challenging because of the higher initial production-induced distortions. Additionally, the fatigue assessment methods used for thicker welded plates are not fully validated for thinner ones. In this doctoral thesis {{a basis for the}} fatigue assessment of welded thin deck structures is provided by thoroughly investigating the effect of initial distortion and geometrical nonlinearity at different levels of analysis, i. e., the welded joint, stiffened panel, and hull girder levels. Extensive geometry measurements, fatigue tests, and geometrically nonlinear finite element (FE) analyses with 3 -mm thick butt and fillet welded dog-bone specimens were carried out to define the experimental fatigue strength. Different welding methods were included in the study, leading to a wide variation in the misalignments. The influence of initial distortion on the structural stress in thin stiffened panels and on the hull girder behavior was studied using geometrically nonlinear FE analysis. The investigation showed that thin welded specimens differ from thicker ones in their larger initial distortions and curved shapes. This significantly affects the straightening effect of the specimen, i. e., the decrease of the structural-to-nominal stress ratio under tension loading. When the actual shape of the specimen and the geometrical nonlinearity were included in the analysis, a fatigue strength similar to that of thicker welded plates was obtained. The stiffened panels behaved linearly under the elastic load range, but the initial distortion shape had a major effect on the structural stress and should therefore be considered. The hull girder analyses revealed that the effect of initial distortion and geometrical nonlinearity on the load-carrying mechanism and on the panel loading is small, and that acceptable accuracy can be obtained without including them. The results show that the current industry standard for fatigue assessment is applicable for the hull girder but not for the stiffened panel and the welded joint analyses. This thesis presents the early efforts towards thinner <b>superstructure</b> <b>decks</b> in modern cruise ships. Before their implementation becomes possible, validation with full-scale stiffened panels or even larger prototype structures is needed to obtain the actual initial distortion shapes and resulting stress distributions, as well as to understand the effects of mean and residual stress. Also, the ultimate strength of the hull girder with thin <b>superstructure</b> <b>decks</b> should be checked...|$|R
