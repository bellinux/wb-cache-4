Base {{on the character}} of discharging frequency far higher than mechanism response frequency in micro-EDM, taking relative discharge ratio statistical rule as control system’s input, according to error and error change of relative discharge ratio and normal discharge ratio, with manual operation control experience of micro-EDM, fuzzy control rules are designed and fuzzy query tabulation is set up. As result of experiments, when micro-EDM is in condition of low working voltage and small current, fuzzy control system with double parameters detection is proved to improve utilization ratio of pulse, so as to increase utilization ratio, increase working <b>speed</b> and <b>reduce</b> wear <b>ratio</b> of electrode...|$|R
40|$|A 0. 4 m {{diameter}} {{horizontal axis}} {{marine current turbine}} was tested in a circulating water channel. The power output was measured over a range of flow speeds, blade pitch and rotor yaw angles. Experimental results were compared with the modelled output determined from a commercial blade element momentum computer package. The measured power output {{was found to be}} far in excess of predicted values for high blade inflow angles. This occurred where approximately half the blade was operating above the stall angle of attack. This represents 25 % of the rotor disk area producing power under heavy stall. Values of overpower up to 140 % were measured which are comparable to previous studies. The results show that power production and the optimum tip <b>speed</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>reduced</b> with yaw except for cases with high blade inflow angles...|$|R

50|$|Athlon 64 also {{features}} CPU speed throttling technology branded Cool'n'Quiet, a feature similar to Intel's SpeedStep that can throttle the processor's clock speed back to facilitate lower power consumption and heat production. When the user is running undemanding applications and the {{load on the}} processor is light, the processor's clock speed and voltage are reduced. This in turn reduces its peak power consumption (max TDP set at 89 W by AMD) to as low as 32 W (stepping C0, clock <b>speed</b> <b>reduced</b> to 800 MHz) or 22W (stepping CG, clock <b>speed</b> <b>reduced</b> to 1 GHz). The Athlon 64 also has an Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS) which prevents the CPU die from accidentally being damaged when mounting and unmounting heat sinks.

40|$|Keywords：Isoprene alcohol {{polyethylene}} glycol; polycarboxylate water reducer; water reducing ratio; adaptability Abstract. In this study, a kind {{of water}} reducing agent based on Isoamyl enol polyoxyethylene ether was synthesized in water solution by radical copolymerization. The influence of copolymerization conditions on dispersing performance of the water reducing agent in the cement was investigated. The molecular structure of the copolymer was tested by NMR, and GPC {{was used to determine}} the molecular weight of copolymer and the big monomer percent conversion, also, testing the adaptability of the water reducing agent in different types of cement. The testing results show that the water reducing agent has the good performance on concrete. When the dosage of water reducing agent was 0. 2 %, the (Deer ding card, P. O 42. 5) slurry flow degree of the cement was 270 mm, and the water <b>reducing</b> <b>ratio</b> reached 19. 6 %. When the dosage of water reducing agent was 0. 3 % and 0. 4 %, the water <b>reducing</b> <b>ratio</b> reached to 28. 6 % and 31. 9 % respectively. Comparing the adaptability of the water reducing agent on all kinds of cement, the water reducing agent performed the worst in the P. C cement and better in the P. O cement, its adaptability in the standard cement and P. S cement was the best. When the dosage of water reducing agent was 0. 2 %- 0. 4 %, the water <b>reducing</b> <b>ratio</b> was nearly the same, When the dosage of water reducing agent was 0. 4 %- 0. 6 %, the water <b>reducing</b> <b>ratio</b> in the standard cement was higher than in the P.
