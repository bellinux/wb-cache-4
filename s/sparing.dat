5|$|As of mid-day Monday, August 29, {{the eye of}} Hurricane Katrina passed east of the City {{subjecting}} it to hurricane wind conditions, but <b>sparing</b> New Orleans {{the worst}} impact. The City seemed to have escaped most of the catastrophic wind damage and heavy rain that had been predicted. Most buildings came through well structurally.|$|E
5|$|Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Cayman Islands {{experienced}} high {{surf and}} heavy rains, though despite a power outage in Grand Cayman, no significant damage was reported. There, 2000people weathered the storm in temporary shelters. The hurricane's outer bands swept over Cuba between August 19 and August 21, bringing heavy rain and high seas, yet <b>sparing</b> the island from damaging winds. Rain from Hurricane Dean flooded several roads throughout Puerto Rico, {{and there was}} heavy surf along the island's coast, but no deaths or injuries were reported.|$|E
5|$|Stylistically, many {{commentators}} have described The Oceanides as either an outright example of Impressionism or somehow derivative of that art movement. Others have countered that Sibelius's active {{development of the}} two subjects, his <b>sparing</b> use of scales favored by Impressionists, and his prioritization of action and structure over ephemeral, atmospheric background distinguish the piece from quintessential examples, such as Debussy's La mer.|$|E
5|$|The Mummy: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was {{composed}} and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith, with orchestrations provided by Alexander Courage. The soundtrack {{was released by}} Decca Records on May 4, 1999. Like many Goldsmith scores, the main theme uses extensive brass and percussion elements; Goldsmith also used <b>sparing</b> amounts of vocals, highly unusual {{for most of his}} work.|$|E
5|$|The {{activism}} of Tablighi Jamaat can be characterised by {{the last}} of the Six Principles. This principle, Tafrigh-i-Waqt (English: <b>sparing</b> of time) justifies the withdrawal from World, though temporarily, for travelling. Travel has been adopted as the most effective method of personal reform and has become an emblematic feature of organisation. They describe the purpose of this retreat as to patch the damages caused by the worldly indulgence and occasionally use the dry-dock parable to explain this.|$|E
5|$|The {{ending of}} Redemption varies {{depending}} upon on {{the quantity of}} humanity Christof has retained during the game. If the quantity is great, Christof reconciles with Anezka and turns her into a vampire, <b>sparing</b> her from death. If his humanity is moderate, he surrenders to Vukodlak and becomes a ghoul; Vukodlak betrays Christof and forces him to murder Anezka. A lesser quantity of humanity results in Christof killing Vukodlak by drinking his blood. Greatly empowered, Christof forsakes his humanity, murders Anezka, and revels in his new power.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} brands ran {{commercials}} {{tied to the}} 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company General Motors aired an advertisement during the annual Super Bowl football game in which {{a group of friends}} drove Chevrolet Silverados through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, Jell-O ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into <b>sparing</b> the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at Boston University, questioned the utility of tying large sums of money to such a unique and short-term event.|$|E
5|$|As {{it entered}} Cleveland County, the National Weather Service and Storm Prediction Center {{activated}} emergency procedures, preparing to evacuate staff and others {{present at the}} facility {{in the event that}} the supercell should turn right, placing areas surrounding the Norman campus in the tornado's path (under NOAA protocol in situations posing a danger to personnel at local Weather Forecast Offices and related guidance centers, responsibility over the issuance of warnings and statements on the unfolding outbreak would have been transferred to the nearest NWS Forecast Office, based in Tulsa, while the SPC's forecasting responsibilities would {{be turned over to the}} 557th Weather Wing at Offutt Air Force Base). The supercell, however, continued on a northeastward track, <b>sparing</b> the Norman area.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{travels to}} Kazan, Russia, where he finds Vesper Lynd's former lover, Yusef Kabira (Simon Kassianides), {{a member of}} Quantum who seduces women with {{valuable}} connections, and who is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau (Stana Katic), a Canadian Intelligence agent, of his true intentions, thus <b>sparing</b> her Vesper's fate. He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene {{was found dead in}} the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Walking away, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.|$|E
5|$|During Titus' {{second visit}} to the {{disaster}} area, a fire struck Rome which lasted for three days. Although {{the extent of the}} damage was not as disastrous as during the Great Fire of 64, crucially <b>sparing</b> the many districts of insulae, Cassius Dio records a long list of important public buildings that were destroyed, including Agrippa's Pantheon, the Temple of Jupiter, the Diribitorium, parts of Pompey's Theatre and the Saepta Julia among others. Once again, Titus personally compensated for the damaged regions. According to Suetonius, a plague similarly struck during the fire. The nature of the disease, however, or the death toll are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Following the NDH's establishment, Đujić {{narrowly}} escaped capture by the Ustaše. As {{early as}} April, Đujić's Chetnik's began killing and mutilating Croats {{in retaliation for}} the wave of Ustaše atrocities against Serb communities across the NDH around the same time. According to Italian reports, Đujić had around 300 Chetniks under his command that month, centered mainly around Knin. By mid-month, his Chetniks were launching raids against communist-held villages between Bosansko Grahovo and Drvar in conjunction with the Italians, who considered him a filibuster. His Chetniks successfully kept the Ustaše out of Knin and its surroundings, <b>sparing</b> the local Serb population from further massacres.|$|E
5|$|In 1799 the 49th was {{assigned}} to the Helder Expedition against the Batavian Republic (now known as the Netherlands), to be led by Sir Ralph Abercromby. During the troop landings, Brock saw his first combat on 10 September 1799 under the command of then-Major-General John Moore. Given that the 49th was in poor shape when Brock took command, they saw little actual combat. Likely Moore was <b>sparing</b> them and using more experienced troops to establish the beachhead. Finally on 2 October the 49th was actively involved in heavy combat at the Battle of Alkmaar, where they acquitted themselves well, sustaining only 33 deaths.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, {{the section}} of highway south of Kalamazoo was named part of the Colgrove Highway. This {{designation}} included several other roads in the Lower Peninsula, all {{named in honor of}} Philip Colgrove, the first president of the Michigan Good Roads Association. Colgrove was also the Barry County prosecutor and a state senator in the late 19th century. No maps documents the name, although the original law remains in records. The Michigan Legislature proposed a bill in 2000 that would have repealed the 1921 statute naming the Colgrove Highway, but the bill ultimately faded, <b>sparing</b> the name.|$|E
5|$|Mace {{discovers the}} fugitives {{and refuses to}} let them go or help find Morrow. The Ghost Rider attacks and defeats Mace, only <b>sparing</b> his life because of Gabe's pleading. Coulson convinces Mace that Robbie can be prosecuted later, and that they need to stop Lucy now. When they find Lucy, Robbie destroys her, but not before she reveals that Morrow wanted the Darkholds power for himself and had {{intentionally}} turned her into this ghostly state. Coulson finds Morrow, to see him attempt an experiment on himself. An energy blast from the experiment makes Coulson, Robbie, and agent Leo Fitz disappear, and Morrow successfully displays the ability to create matter.|$|E
5|$|Not My Life calls {{attention}} to the fact that, in the United States, the sentencing for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking as a matter of good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was <b>sparing</b> in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.|$|E
5|$|Rain from Hurricane Dean closed several roads {{throughout}} Puerto Rico {{and there}} was heavy surf along the island's coast, but no deaths or injuries were reported. The hurricane's outer bands swept over Cuba between August 19 and August 21, bringing heavy rain and high seas, but <b>sparing</b> the island its damaging winds. In the Cayman Islands, rain flooded roads and there were high waves along the coast, but no deaths or serious injuries were reported. There were localized power outages and the water supply was shut off briefly, {{but the rest of}} the island's infrastructure was unaffected. Approximately 2,000people weathered the storm in temporary shelters.|$|E
5|$|Some species (such as Tetramorium caespitum) {{attack and}} take over {{neighbouring}} ant colonies. Others are less expansionist, but just as aggressive; they invade colonies to steal eggs or larvae, which they either eat or raise as workers or slaves. Extreme specialists among these slave-raiding ants, such as the Amazon ants, are incapable of feeding themselves and need captured workers to survive. Captured workers of the enslaved species Temnothorax have evolved a counter strategy, destroying just the female pupae of the slave-making Protomognathus americanus, but <b>sparing</b> the males (who don't take part in slave-raiding as adults).|$|E
5|$|The Brahma Vaivarta Purana narrates {{that the}} {{celestial}} cow – called Kapila here – produces various weapons and an army to aid Jamadagni defeat the king's army, {{who had come}} to seize her. When the king himself challenged Jamadagni for battle, Kapila instructed her master in martial arts. Jamadagni led the army created by Kapila and defeated the king and his army several times; each time <b>sparing</b> the life of the king. Finally, {{with the aid of a}} divine spear granted to him by the god Dattatreya, the king killed Jamadagni.|$|E
5|$|The {{inaugural address}} was a {{detailed}} {{statement of the}} Whig agenda, essentially a repudiation of Jackson and Van Buren's policies. Harrison promised to reestablish the Bank of the United States and extend its capacity for credit by issuing paper currency (Henry Clay's American system); to defer to the judgment of Congress on legislative matters, with <b>sparing</b> use of his veto power; and to reverse Jackson's spoils system of executive patronage. He promised to use patronage to create a qualified staff, not to enhance his own standing in government.|$|E
5|$|The main {{benefit of}} breast {{brachytherapy}} compared to whole breast irradiation {{is that a}} high dose of radiation can be precisely applied to the tumour while <b>sparing</b> radiation to healthy breast tissues and underlying structures such as the ribs and lungs. APBI can typically be completed {{over the course of}} a week. The option of brachytherapy may be particularly important in ensuring that working women, the elderly or women without easy access to a treatment centre, are able to benefit from breast-conserving therapy due to the short treatment course compared with WBI (which often requires more visits over the course of 1–2 months).|$|E
5|$|Though Houston is {{the largest}} city in the United States without formal zoning regulations, it has {{developed}} similarly to other Sun Belt cities because the city's land use regulations and legal covenants have played a similar role. Regulations include mandatory lot size for single-family houses and requirements that parking be available to tenants and customers. Such restrictions have had mixed results. Though some have blamed the city's low density, urban sprawl, and lack of pedestrian-friendliness on these policies, the city's land use has also been credited with having significant affordable housing, <b>sparing</b> Houston the worst effects of the 2008 real estate crisis. The city issued 42,697 building permits in 2008 and was ranked first {{in the list of}} healthiest housing markets for 2009.|$|E
5|$|When Operation Bagration {{commenced}} in the Vitebsk {{region on}} 22 June 1944, {{it was decided}} that female snipers would be withdrawn. They voluntarily continued to support the advancing infantry anyway, and despite the Soviet policy of <b>sparing</b> snipers, Shanina asked to be sent to the front line. Although her request was refused, she went anyway. Shanina was later sanctioned for going to the front line without permission, but did not face a court martial. She wanted to be attached to a battalion or a reconnaissance company, turning to the commander of the 5th Army, Nikolai Krylov. Shanina also wrote twice to Joseph Stalin with the same request.|$|E
5|$|While the two fight, Strange {{activates}} Protocol 10, {{which is}} {{revealed to be}} a scheme {{to wipe out the}} entire population of Arkham City and destroy the criminal element of Gotham. TYGER troops begin executing inmates as Strange launches missile strikes on Arkham's denizens from his base in Wonder Tower. A missile hits the steelmill, burying Batman under rubble. Before Joker {{can take advantage of the}} situation, Talia arrives and offers him immortality in exchange for <b>sparing</b> Batman's life. After escaping with the help of Catwoman, Batman is convinced by Alfred to end Protocol 10 before pursuing Talia and Joker.|$|E
5|$|After {{exiting the}} Fijian {{archipelago}} of islands, Cyclone Gene moved towards the west across the South Pacific, towards Vanuatu, and was predicted {{to affect the}} archipelago between January 31 and February 2. However, during January 31, the system started to re-curve towards the southeast {{and as a result}} did not make landfall on the island, but Gene's outerbands produced gale force winds and heavy rain on various southern Vanuatuan islands for about 12 hours. However the system only caused no deaths and severe damage to Futuna island, while <b>sparing</b> other nearby islands. On Futuna Island, Gene caused damages to buildings, Plants used for weaving and generating income, trails, native and non native homes, waterlines, food gardens, food producing plants, crops, and other critical structures and littered footpaths with fallen trees and debris. As a result of damages to waterlines from falling debris, flooding and contaminated drinking water were reported in some villages with pipes openly leaking. After an aerial survey found that more than 70% of garden crops had been damaged by Gene, the Vanuatu Government declared Futuna island a disaster zone.|$|E
5|$|After the Inhuman leader Jiaying {{refuses to}} risk {{anyone else to}} rescue Campbell, Raina {{receives}} a vision of Skye saving him, and convinces Gordon to take Skye to the Playground, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s base. Coulson reforms his original S.H.I.E.L.D. team of May, Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, and they fly to the Arctic in their old mobile command base, a plane called the Bus. Their approach is detected by Hydra, who shoot down the Bus with missiles, but the team escape in a quinjet and infiltrate the base with Bakshi's help. Coulson, May, and Fitz break into the base's control rooms to steal information about Hydra leader Wolfgang von Strucker's primary headquarters in the small Eastern European nation of Sokovia, while Skye, Ward, Bakshi, and Simmons rescue Peterson and Campbell. During the rescue, Simmons attempts to kill Ward as she once promised she would, but Bakshi {{gets in the way}} and Simmons murders him instead, and Ward flees after <b>sparing</b> Simmons' life.|$|E
5|$|After {{the player}} {{successfully}} obtains {{the assistance of}} each of the primary factions, a Landsmeet is called among the nobles of Ferelden. There, the player confronts Loghain, ultimately either executing him or <b>sparing</b> and initiating him into the Grey Wardens (causing Alistair to resign). The player also settles who will lead Ferelden against the Blight (Alistair and/or Anora) and rallies the rest of the kingdom against the Darkspawn. At this point, the player learns that due to the Taint, only a Grey Warden can slay the Archdemon. Killing it will release a demonic essence within it, which is drawn to the Taint in the Grey Warden and effectively kills them; if anyone else slays it, the essence will survive and find a new host in the nearest Darkspawn, making the monster effectively immortal.|$|E
5|$|As the Red Army drew nearer in July 1944, the SS began {{closing down}} the easternmost {{concentration}} camps and evacuating the remaining prisoners westward to Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen concentration camp. Göth's personal secretary, Mietek Pemper, alerted Schindler to the Nazis' plans to close all factories not {{directly involved in}} the war effort, including Schindler's enamelware facility. Pemper suggested to Schindler that production should be switched from cookware to anti-tank grenades in an effort to save the lives of the Jewish workers. Using bribery and his powers of persuasion, Schindler convinced Göth and the officials in Berlin to allow him to move his factory and his workers to Brünnlitz (Czech: Brněnec), in the Sudetenland, thus <b>sparing</b> them from certain death in the gas chambers. Using names provided by Jewish Ghetto Police officer Marcel Goldberg, Pemper compiled and typed the list of 1,200 Jews—1,000 of Schindler's workers and 200 inmates from Julius Madritsch's textiles factory—who were sent to Brünnlitz in October 1944.|$|E
5|$|At Cortex's base, Uka Uka derides Cortex {{for failing}} to destroy Crash and replaces Cortex with his niece, Nina Cortex, despite protests from Neo, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger. Nina has Coco brainwashed and makes her {{participate}} {{in the construction of}} the Doominator. Throughout the course of the game, Crash and Aku Aku interrogate Tiny Tiger, Doctor N. Gin and Uka Uka on the whereabouts of Coco. When they confront Nina Cortex inside the Doominator robot, Nina summons her Arachnina cyborg and fights Crash. Crash eventually destroys the robot, liberating Coco and disabling the Doominator. The Doominator collapses and barely misses the Bandicoot home (and Crunch), <b>sparing</b> much of Wumpa Island. Escaping from the collapsed Doominator, Cortex praises Nina for betraying him, and promises to be more evil in the near future. The Bandicoots decide that it is time for celebration, leading Crash to shout his first word in the series and the object of their celebration: pancakes.|$|E
5|$|By July 1944, Germany {{was losing}} the war; the SS began closing down the easternmost {{concentration}} camps and deporting the remaining prisoners westward. Many {{were killed in}} Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen concentration camp. Schindler convinced SS-Hauptsturmführer Amon Göth, commandant of the nearby Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp, {{to allow him to}} move his factory to Brünnlitz in the Sudetenland, thus <b>sparing</b> his workers from almost certain death in the gas chambers. Using names provided by Jewish Ghetto Police officer Marcel Goldberg, Göth's secretary Mietek Pemper compiled and typed the list of 1,200 Jews who travelled to Brünnlitz in October 1944. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the execution of his workers until the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, by which time he had spent his entire fortune on bribes and black market purchases of supplies for his workers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the events}} of Halo 3 (2007), the Flood {{intelligence}} known as the Gravemind infests and captures High Charity, while the Elites assist humans on Earth in defending themselves. Truth's forces excavate a portal to the Ark, located outside the Milky Way. The Elites follow Truth, and the Covenant Arbiter, or holy warrior, kills Truth ultimately ending the Covenant. After the Flood controlled High Charity arrives at the Ark, the Arbiter and Master Chief decide to activate a partially built Halo ring (the replacement for the ring that the Master Chief destroyed in the first game) destroying the Flood and <b>sparing</b> {{the rest of the}} galaxy. The remaining humans and Elites escape back through the portal. The Human-Covenant war ends in March 2553, and the Arbiter leads his Elites back to their homeworld.|$|E
5|$|Coleman Reese, an {{accountant}} at Wayne Enterprises, deduces that Bruce is Batman {{and tries to}} go public with the information. After observing the unpredictability of the Joker, Maroni informs Commissioner Gordon of the Joker's location. The Joker sets fire to the mob's money, burning Lau alive in the process, and kills the Chechen. Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills Reese. Gordon orders the evacuation of all the hospitals in Gotham and goes to secure Reese. The Joker finds Dent in Gotham General and manipulates him into seeking revenge for Rachel's death on Gotham's corrupt systems. The Joker then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree based on a coin flip and targets people he holds responsible for Rachel's death, killing Wuertz and Maroni while <b>sparing</b> Ramirez.|$|E
5|$|In <b>sparing</b> the lives, the French {{are awarded}} by God with the {{collapse}} of a bridge that leads to many of the English soldiers drowning and a quick victory. The English, after losing Tourelles, fall back to the coast to await for reinforcements. Word comes that the Burgundian troops are coming to help the English. Joan meets with the Duke of Burgundy to warn him against a battle before she returns to her men to help bury the dead. Talbot's son comes with reinforcements from England, and the English army attacks the French at Patay. During the battle, Joan is able to kill the son and Conrade is able to kill the father. This causes the English to flee and, in turn, allows the French to retake Rheims. Once Rheims is free, Charles comes and is crowned the King of France. The story ends with Joan telling him to be a good king.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 2006, NBN {{adopted a}} new logo and on air graphics, {{in line with}} Nine's new logo. However, the news {{department}} did not update its graphics until 15 March. During April 2007, SP Telemedia {{announced that it would}} consider selling NBN Television, and had received at least two bids, one each from WIN Corporation and PBL Media. On 9 May 2007, PBL Media's (now Nine Entertainment Co.) A$250 million bid became final, winning the sale. However, upon acquiring NBN, PBL did not fold it into the main Nine Network, but continued to operate it as a regional station. The purchase also secured permanent status of supplying Nine's content to the station's entire coverage area, <b>sparing</b> any future affiliation switches (particularly the 2016 Australian television shakeup involving Southern Cross Austereo and WIN Corporation).|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{sought to}} ingratiate himself with Mehmed by sending out orders to commanders and castellans to surrender, {{enabling}} his captor to take command {{of more than}} 70 towns in one week. Mehmed, however, {{had no intention of}} <b>sparing</b> Stephen's life and summoned him on 25 May. Stephen fearfully brought Angelović's document, but Mehmed's Persian-born mullah, Ali al-Bistami, issued a fatwah declaring that the Sultan was not bound to keep the promise made by his servant without his knowledge. As if to demonstrate the validity of his fatwah, the elderly mullah took out his sword and beheaded Stephen in front of Mehmed. The chronicler Benedetto Dei, who claimed to {{have been part of the}} Sultan's retinue, recorded that Mehmed himself decapitated Stephen. According to later accounts, Mehmed had Stephen flayed or used as a shooting target. The execution of the King, his uncle, cousin and two noblemen took place in a field next to Jajce, which has since been known as Carevo Polje ("the Emperor's Field").|$|E
5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and <b>sparing</b> the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E
