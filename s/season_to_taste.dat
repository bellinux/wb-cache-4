50|$|Thai basil {{is widely}} used in the cuisines of Southeast Asia, {{including}} Thai, Vietnamese, Lao, and Cambodian cuisines. Thai basil leaves are a frequent ingredient in Thai green and red curries, though in Thailand the basil used in drunken noodles and many chicken, pork, and seafood dishes is holy basil. In the West, however, such dishes typically contain Thai basil instead, {{which is much more}} readily available than holy basil. Thai basil is also an important ingredient in the very popular Taiwanese dish sanbeiji (three-cup chicken). Used as a condiment, a plate of raw Thai basil leaves is often served as an accompaniment to many Vietnamese dishes, such as phở, bún bò Huế, or bánh xèo, so that each person can <b>season</b> <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> with the anise-flavored leaves.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, the salted fruit brine {{created in}} this process is <b>seasoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> with chile powder, {{becoming}} chamoy. This liquid may be further reduced, or thickened with pureed fruit, to achieve a variety of consistencies.|$|R

50|$|Tongue toast is a {{traditional}} open sandwich prepared with sauteed beef tongue and scrambled eggs. It is <b>seasoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> with black pepper and onions. The tongue was sometimes served on buttered toast with a poached egg instead of a scrambled one. While it was primarily prepared as a dish for breakfast, it was also eaten for lunch and dinner.|$|R

5000|$|Matignon is a {{combination}} of minced vegetables, usually onion (and/or leek), celery, and carrot, with a sprig of thyme and half a bay leaf, sautéed in butter over a low flame until softened and translucent ("melted" [...] but not browned), <b>seasoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> with a pinch of salt (and a pinch of sugar, if needed), and finished with a dash of white wine or Madeira. The vegetarian version is referred to as maigre ("lean"). When ham or bacon is added, it is called gras ("fat," [...] i.e., containing meat). Frequently the vegetables serve as a bed on which to cook meat, poultry, and fish dishes; or as a stuffing; but sometimes the Matignon is served as separate side dish in its own right.|$|R

5000|$|Main {{ingredient}} of kuchela is the pulp of unripe mangos {{that is being}} grated and thoroughly strained, if necessary by drying. Afterwards it is mixed with amchar masala and various additional spices. Amchar masala {{is a blend of}} spices containing cilantro, cumin, fennel, fenugreek, mustard seeds and black pepper. The hotness level is regulated by adding either fresh peppers (scotch bonnets and [...] "congo peppers" [...] (habaneros) being common) or a hot sauce. The relish is then <b>seasoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>tasted</b> with salt, sugar and garlic; vinegar is also common. By adding oil, usually mustard oil, the texture can be adjusted. As a relish, kuchela is used in a lot of ways, for example as a side dish to curries or pelau (a rice dish similar to pilaf) or as a topping for doubles.|$|R
50|$|Malaysia {{does not}} produce wheat, and all {{supplies}} are imported from wheat-producing countries. Nevertheless, Western style white bread and Indian breads made with wheat flour like roti canai are fairly common foods in the modern Malaysian diet today. A very typical way of serving white bread in Malaysia is having it toasted and spread with kaya, a sweet spread made from a base of coconut milk, eggs and sugar. Reflecting the British colonial influence in Malaysia, kaya toast or roti bakar is a popular breakfast staple and afternoon tea snack. It is typically paired {{with a cup of}} local brewed coffee or tea, and soft-boiled eggs <b>to</b> be <b>seasoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> by the diner with soy sauce & ground white pepper. Roti kahwin is a variation where butter is sandwiched along with a layer of kaya between slices of untoasted white bread.|$|R

50|$|In {{northern}} Mexico and in American Tex-Mex cuisine, refried {{beans are}} usually prepared with pinto beans, {{but many other}} varieties of bean are used {{in other parts of}} Mexico, such as black, Peruano, or red (kidney) beans. The raw beans can be cooked when dry or soaked overnight, then stewed, drained of most of the remaining liquid, and converted into a paste with a masher (such as a potato masher), or pressed through a fine mesh sieve (to remove the skins). Some of the drained liquid, or chicken or vegetable stock, is added if the consistency is too dry. The paste is then baked or fried, usually with onion and garlic in a small amount of lard, vegetable oil, bacon drippings or butter and <b>seasoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> with salt and spices. Lard is generally used more often in Mexico, and it has a large effect on flavor. Epazote is a common herb used to add a special and unique flavor. It is also a carminative, which means it reduces the gas associated with beans.|$|R
50|$|Fattoush {{includes}} {{vegetables and}} herbs according <b>to</b> <b>season</b> and <b>taste.</b> The vegetables are cut into relatively large pieces compared to tabbouleh which requires ingredients to be finely chopped. Staghorn sumac is usually {{used to give}} fattoush its sour taste.|$|R
50|$|Africans brought and {{preserved}} {{many of their}} traditions and cooking techniques. They were often given less desired cuts of meat, including shoulder and intestines. Menudo, for example, {{was derived from the}} habit of the Spaniards of giving the slaves cow's intestines. Slaves developed a way to clean the offal and <b>season</b> it <b>to</b> <b>taste.</b> Slaves in the southern United States also did the same thing to the pig's intestines given to them. In South America, the scraps of food the landlords did not eat, and by mixing what they got they usually ended coming up with new plates that nowadays have been adopted into the cuisine of their respective nation (such being the case with the Peruvian tacu-tacu).|$|R
5000|$|It is {{not enough}} to keep strange men of the enemy's breed away from your actual defences, letting them go free to warn their friends of your {{existence}} and whereabouts—even though they should not be under temptation to impart any knowledge they may have obtained. [...] "Another way," [...] as the cookery book says, more economical in lives, would be as follows: Gather and warmly greet a sufficiency of strangers. Stuff well with chestnuts as to the large force about to join you in a few hours; garnish with corroborative detail, and <b>season</b> according <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> with whiskey or tobacco. This will very likely be sufficient for the nearest commando. Probable cost—some heavy and glib lying, but no lives will be expended.|$|R
50|$|Tostones (also {{known as}} banana peze in Haiti, tachinos or chatinos in Cuba, platanos verdes fritos or fritos verdes in the Dominican Republic and patacones in Nicaragua, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, Peru and Venezuela) are twice-fried {{plantain}} patties, often {{served as a}} side, appetizer, or snack. Plantains are sliced in 4 cm long pieces and fried in oil. The segments are then removed and individually smashed down either with a bottle's bottom side, or with a tostonera, to about half their original height. Finally, the pieces are fried again and then <b>seasoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>taste,</b> often with salt. In some countries, such as Haiti, Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, the tostones are dipped in creole sauce from chicken, pork, beef, or shrimp before eating. In some South American countries, the name tostones is used to describe this food when prepared at home and also plantain chips (mentioned above), which are typically purchased from a store. In western Venezuela, much of Colombia and the Peruvian Amazon, patacones are very popular. Plantains are again sliced in long pieces and fried in oil, then {{they are used to}} make sandwiches with pork, beef, chicken, vegetables and ketchup. They can be made with unripe patacon verde or ripe patacon amarillo plantains. Tostones in the Dominican Republic are once-fried and are thicker than chips. Although there are many names for tostones in almost every Latin country they are still commonly called tostones in all of Latin America.|$|R
50|$|In Peru chifle {{is typical}} of the Piura Region. It {{consists}} of fried slices or strips of either ripe or green plantains <b>seasoned</b> with salt <b>to</b> <b>taste.</b> In the region of Piura, chifle is traditionally fried in wood-burning stoves with wood of the algorrobo blanco (a species of mesquite tree), which gives chifle a special aroma and taste. Depending on the type of plantain (ripe or green) the flavor can be sweet or savory. Sometimes it is served with cancha serrana (pan-roasted :maize) or shredded cecina (pork jerky).|$|R
50|$|Carsley joined Premiership strugglers Blackburn Rovers in March 1999 for a £3.4 million fee. He made 8 {{appearances}} {{in the final two}} months of the 1998-99 <b>season,</b> failing <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> victory and suffering relegation to Division One. Back in the second-tier, Carsley was encouraged to play a more advanced midfield role by manager Brian Kidd and showed the best goalscoring form of his career, topping the club's chart with 11 goals, though Rovers could finish no better than 11th. Despite falling out of favour with new manager Graeme Souness and handing in a transfer request, Carsley played on into the 2000-01 season before leaving the club in December 2000. Carsley made 55 appearances and scored 13 goals during just over 18 months at Ewood Park. Carsley recalled in 2013 that he enjoyed working under Brian Kidd and living in the town.|$|R
5000|$|Best import awardees Norman Black and Donnie Ray Koonce {{teamed up}} {{for the first time as}} Alaska's pair in the Third Conference. The Milkmen lost their first game to Ginebra, 115-122 on September 25, which also parade an {{explosive}} pair of best import winners Billy Ray Bates and Michael Hackett. After five games in the eliminations and Alaska carrying a 2-win, 3-loss card, Donnie Ray Koonce was replaced by Keith Morrison. Starting the second round of eliminations, the Milkmen welcome back head coach Tony Vasquez from the bench but his return was spoiled by Alaska's 111-114 loss to Manila Beer on October 19. [...] The Milkmen won two of their last three games in the eliminations after coach Tony Vasquez' death for a 4-8 won-loss card. Alaska once again enters the quarterfinal round with the least chance of advancing into the semifinals as they were two games behind the other three quarterfinalists; Tanduay, Great Taste and Shell. The Milkmen were booted out of contention by Tanduay, 108-110 on November 11, they won their next game against Formula Shell before losing their last game of the <b>season</b> <b>to</b> Great <b>Taste.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mianzhu is a {{symbolic}} place presenting the south-west cities which produce lots of special products, {{such as the}} peal from Jiulong Mountain, a branch of Longmen Mountain.

25|$|Recent {{research}} {{reveals a}} potential taste receptor called the CD36 receptor. CD36 was targeted {{as a possible}} lipid taste receptor because it binds to fat molecules (more specifically, long-chain fatty acids), {{and it has been}} localized <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> bud cells (specifically, the circumvallate and foliate papillae). There is a debate over whether we can truly taste fats, and supporters of our ability <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> free fatty acids (FFAs) have based the argument on a few main points: there is an evolutionary advantage to oral fat detection; a potential fat receptor has been located on taste bud cells; fatty acids evoke specific responses that activate gustatory neurons, similar to other currently accepted tastes; and, there is a physiological response to the presence of oral fat. Although CD36 has been studied primarily in mice, research examining human subjects' ability <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> fats found that those with high levels of CD36 expression were more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>tasting</b> fat than were those with low levels of CD36 expression; this study points to a clear association between CD36 receptor quantity and the ability <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> fat.|$|R
