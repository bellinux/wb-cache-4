As {{with the previous}} series, Victorian Farm, Edwardian Farm and Tales from the Green Valley, the first episode begins with the team moving into a cottage farm, this time in Hampshire. With a second European war looming on the horizon, the team set about making a number of improvements to the farm. The installation of electric lighting (from a portable petrol-powered generator) allows them to work later into the evenings, while household labour-savers like a Hoosier cabinet, paraffin range cooker, electric clothes iron and linoleum flooring mean Ruth can spend more time aiding the war effort and less time on household chores. Alex and Peter, meanwhile, set about constructing a Mole <b>Subsoiler</b> from scrap farming equipment, to drain their waterlogged clay fields.

Four-row implements were used on a Norfolk loamy sand (Typic Kandiudults; FAO classification Luxic Ferralsols).

The small chamber system showed that trafficked areas exhibited lower CO 2 efflux relative to in-row and untrafficked row positions. Comparable CO 2 flux patterns were noted between the large canopy and small soil chamber systems (averaged over all positions).

Equipment performance and in-field efficiency are two variables that can be improved to minimize fuel consumption and ultimately reduce input costs for crop production. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of transmission gear selection on fuel costs, draft, and other equipment performance variables using two deep tillage implements. Three different transmission gears were selected which represented slow, normal, and fast operating speeds for two typical in-row, integral <b>subsoilers</b> (KMC generation I rip-strip and Bigham Brothers ParatillTM). Tractor fuel consumption, slip, axle torque, and engine speed were measured in real-time along with transverse and vertical draft forces. Results indicated a 105 % increase in fuel consumption rate, a 28 % increase in implement draft, and a 255 % increase in power between the slow and fast speed for the ParatillTM. The KMC showed a 115 % increase in fuel consumption rate, a 37 % increase in implement draft, and a 283 % increase in power between the slow and fast speeds. Good comparisons were found between measured and estimated, using published equations, for fuel consumption (- 5. 3 % to 4. 9 %) and draft (- 3. 6 % to 17. 7 %). For the ParatillTM, the normal speed produced the lowest fuel cost ($ 5. 10 /ha) but operating at this speed reduced productivity rate from 4. 55 ha/h at the fast speed down to 3. 23 ha/h. Conversely, the KMC fast speed provided the lowest fuel cost ($ 5. 35 /ha) and highest productivity rate (4. 35 ha/h) for this implement. In general, the ParatillTM provided the highest productivity and lowest fuel cost when operated at the typical speeds in the Southeastern US (around the normal to fast) mostly likely due to the lower required draft. In summary, the minimum fuel usage for each implement occurred at a different ground speed however, productivity was maximized at the fast speed with data reported useful to practitioners managing these style tillage implements...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{structure}} and crop response under annual compactive loads of 10 and 18 t/axle and compaction alleviation treatments were assessed {{in a continuous}} corn production system. The alleviation treatments consisted of chemical conditioning with a non-ionic surfactant, and subsoiling with narrow-tined and winged implements. Parameters utilized for determining effects on soil structure were bulk density, water retention characteristics and soil profile characteristics. Significant topsoil and subsoil compaction resulted from both loading levels. Crop yield reductions due to compactive loading ranged from 18 to 27 % under optimal weather conditions and were as high as 55 to 86 % under adverse weather conditions. Soil amendments by chemical conditioning had no beneficial effect on soil structure or crop yields. Inter-row subsoiling with narrow-tined and winged <b>subsoilers</b> was effective in reducing soil compaction and increasing crop yields. Soil bulk density measurements gave good indication of overall compaction {{to a depth of}} 0. 4 m and correlated well with crop yields, but were unable to locate differences between compactive treatments. Water retention characteristics indicated significant differences between compactive treatments to a depth of 0. 6 m. Soil profile characteristics were useful for determining ped type and size as well as rooting depth and gave the best overall assessment of compaction alleviation effects. Studies were also conducted to develop a method for predicting soil compactibility that would serve to manage soil compaction at the farm level. Preliminary studies focused on the determination of soil material properties for predicting bulk density changes under applied loads. Further investigations were conducted on the variations in constrained modulus, cone index and soil bulk density values under uniaxial loading. A model relating constrained modulus as a function of cone index, bulk density and soil moisture content was developed. Subsequent studies conducted yielded significant relationships between penetration resistance and soil compactibility as indicated by constrained modulus and coefficient of compressibility. Relationships obtained between penetration resistance and parameters of compactive work and bulk density change indicated the feasibility of assessing soil compactibility at the farm level...|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, as more farm power is being demanded on farms, due to {{increased}} farm sizes and operating speeds, larger and heavier farm machines are deployed in various farming operations. Their cumulative negative effects have become more apparent with increased incidences of soil compaction problems. This has forced many farmers to practice deep tilling, using subsoilers to break up compacted subsoil layers. In some maize growing regions of South Africa, conventional subsoilers are used in a tandem configuration. The farmers believe {{that the use of}} subsoilers in this mode reduces the draft force per unit area tilled. This probably happens because the critical depth for the rear <b>subsoiler</b> is increased beyond its working depth of 600 mm. Operating in this mode necessitated this study, with the ultimate goal of testing an appropriate existing force model for a single tine in predicting the force requirements of the front <b>subsoiler</b> in a tandem configuration. Secondly, to develop an alternative model for the rear <b>subsoiler</b> based on the three-dimensional failed soil-profile and to determine the relative position of the front <b>subsoiler</b> at which energy utilization is optimized. To develop the proposed model, an analytical approach based on limit equilibrium analysis was used and a Matlab-based computer program was coded to solve it. Its verification was conducted through field experiments in sandy clay loam soil. The experiments consisted of a continuous measurement of the horizontal and vertical forces acting on each <b>subsoiler</b> by a two-dimensional force transducer system. At the same time, the three-dimensional and thus the cross-sectional areas of the disturbed soil-profiles at different sections were measured, as well as the soil characteristics. A manual method employing a pin-profile meter was used to measure the vertical cross-sectional areas of the failed soil-profiles at 100 mm intervals. Further more, a technique using an automatic penetrometer and a computer program was developed to identify and map the three-dimensional failed soil-profiles. This technique indicated that the <b>subsoiler</b> failed the soil beyond its maximum operating depth and width. The results also indicated that the soil-failure pattern at close spacing is in phase at both subsoilers, leading to reduced total draft force requirements. At a wider spacing, the soil-failure pattern was out of phase, thus resulting in increased total draft force requirements. At the same time, the cross-sectional area tilled per unit draft force increased with increased spacing. This was because the failed maximum cross-sectional area increased in size faster than the total draft force as the spacing was increased. The proposed model verification results show that the predicted and recorded forces at the rear <b>subsoiler</b> correlated reasonably well at a wider spacing. When the front <b>subsoiler</b> was shallow working and close to the rear <b>subsoiler,</b> the model under- predicted the measured forces on the rear <b>subsoiler,</b> whilst the Swick-Perumpral model over predicted the applied forces to the front <b>subsoiler</b> and this was generally the case at wider spacings. Furthermore the efficiency of the subsoilers was maximized when the longitudinal spacing was such that it allowed the soil failed by the front <b>subsoiler</b> to stabilize before the rear <b>subsoiler</b> reached it. The maximum cross-sectional area failed per unit draft force was recorded when the depth of the front <b>subsoiler</b> was equal to about 80 % of the rear subsoiler-operating depth. The knowledge contributed by this research will not only facilitate qualitative field operations and optimize energy use, but also promote better management decisions.

40|$|Abstract Compaction {{is applied}} by an {{external}} {{force on the}} soil and its result is decreasing soil macro porosity and increasing soil bulk density. One of the main important parameter in soil compaction is mechanization in agriculture and travelling in the fields. Compaction with decreasing in soil infiltration, percentage of stable aggregates and decreasing soil porosity limits the developing of roots, infiltration and decreasing {{of water in the}} soil and finally decreases crop yield. In order to study of the effect of C and L shape <b>subsoiler</b> on water consumption and quantitative and qualitative characteristics of cotton, an experiment was conducted in Hashem Ababd of Gorgan in silt-clay-loam soil for two years. This study carried out in split plot arrangement based on randomised complete block design with three replications. Two methods of subsoiling (parallel and perpendicular to row plant) were taken as a main plot and the form of <b>subsoiler</b> (L shape, C shape and moldboard as testimonial) were assigned to sub plot. C and L shape Subsoilers decrease the soil penetration resistance significantly which this decreasing was more in C shape <b>subsoiler.</b> the results showed that none of the treatments, subsoilers, the methods of subsoiling and their reciprocal effects, did not affect on cotton yield in the first year. However, the continuity of the second year subsoiling affected significantly the cotton yield.

40|$|The {{development}} of simple regression relationships, based on finite element (FEM) analyses of cutting a sandy loam soil by medium-deep <b>subsoiler</b> will provide confidential and quick tools {{to predict the}} <b>subsoiler</b> draught requirement for any combination of moisture content (w), wet bulk density (rho (w)) and tillage depth (d). Large number of FEM analyses were performed to assess the effect of w, d and rho (w) on <b>subsoiler</b> draught. This draught was calculated from the output of 126 FEM modelling analyses. The model variations were selected based on the interaction among the studied variables, namely, six moisture contents ranging from 0. 03 to 0. 22 m(3) m(- 3), five wet bulk densities ranging from 1. 3 to 2. 0 Mg/m(3) and six tillage depths ranging from 0. 10 to 0. 37 m. The interaction among these three variables was also taken into consideration, and a multiple linear regression analysis was performed aiming at establishing a mathematical relationship for simulating the draught variation {{as a function of}} these variables. Further relationship was developed for relating the variation in draught with iv, d and dry bulk density (rho (d)) The FEM showed that <b>subsoiler</b> draught increased with d, rho (w) and rho (d), whereas it decreased with w. The decrease in draught with w did not extend beyond a w of 0. 17 m(3) m(- 3), since the draught calculated for 0. 22 m(3) m(- 3) w was very close to that calculated for a w of 0. 17 m(3) m(- 3). Regression equations developed to relate the <b>subsoiler</b> draught with w, d, rho (w) and rho (d) were of quite simple forms, and had high determination coefficients (R- 2) close to 0. 95. These equations indicated that the horizontal force varied linearly with w and non-linearly with d, rho (w) and rho (d). This non-linear variation of draught was found to be a quadratic function of d and rho (w) and a cubic function of rho (d). A comparison of the calculated and measured draught for cutting a similar sandy loam soil with a similarly designed <b>subsoiler,</b> showed a good approximation. The small divergence between the calculated and measured draught was attributed to the difference in soil texture and <b>subsoiler</b> chisel length. Thus, the regression equation developed proved to be a capable tool of predicting the draught requirements of the selected tillage tool design, when cutting sandy loam soils under any combination of w, d and rho (w).

To verify the on-line measured rho map, this map was compared with the map measured by the conventional core sampling method. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Implements for tilling {{compacted}} {{forest soils}} were tested on sites logged with ground-based machines in Oregon. The sites covered {{a variety of}} soil conditions ranging from a clay loam to a rock 7 2 C 2 iplemeflts tested included disk harrows (four aies), brusa blades (three sites), standard <b>subsoiler</b> tines (two sites), wing. - ed <b>subsoiler</b> tines (two sites), and rock ripper tines (five sites). Soil density and strength measurements made prior to the tillage operatIons indicated that the depth of compacted soil within primary skid trails exceeded 12 inches and was often detectable {{to a depth of}} 18 inches. Logging debris typically was incorporated into the skid trail surfaces. The disk harrow proved ineffective for loosening compacted forest soils at depth when: 1) the soil had a high rock content, 2) disk weighting was insufficient, or 3) the trail cross-section was concave and the harrow wide. The brush blade failed to loosen the deeper layers of compaction and resulted in transfer of some of the loosened soil to the trail edges. The short closely-spaced tines did not allow loosened soil and logging debris to pass between the tines. The performance of <b>subsoiler</b> and rock ripper tines was favorable in the rocky coarse-grained soils and some of the cohesive soils. However, plastic flow rather than shatterin. g occurred when tines operated below their crit- [...] ical depth. The critical depth was controlled by soil conditions and tue geometry. The winged <b>subsoiler</b> tines resulted in 30 to 64 percent greater shattering than did standard <b>subsoiler</b> tines at a ripping depth of 1. 5 feet. Close tine spacing caused logging debris to accumulate in front of the tines. The tines produced large angular clods when working in a cohesive soil. These clods did not break down after heavy rains. Clods from coarse-grain soils broke down readily when moistened. A trapezoid-shaped representatjoii of the soil sbattering pattern produced by tines was shown to compare adequately with actual shattering patterns. A computer program was developed to analyze ripping depth and tine spacing combinations resulting in maximum shattering across the skid trail width. The cost of the tillage operations ranged from 89 to 228 per mile of skid trail (1980 - 1981 dollars) ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Vibrating a tillage tool is an {{effective}} way of reducing the draft force required to pull it through the soil. The degree of draft force reduction {{is dependent on the}} combination of operating parameters and soil conditions. It is thus necessary to optimize the vibratory implement for different conditions. Numerical modelling is more flexible than experimental testing and analytical models, and less costly than experimental testing. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) was specifically developed for granular materials such as soils and can be used to model a vibrating tillage tool for its design and optimization. The goal was thus to evaluate the ability of DEM to model a vibratory <b>subsoiler</b> and to investigate the cause of the draft force reduction. The DEM model was evaluated against data obtained from field testing done with a full scale single tine vibratory <b>subsoiler.</b> Soil testing was also done for material characterization and for the calibration of DEM material properties. The <b>subsoiler</b> was simulated using a commercial code, PFC 3 D. The effect on the simulation results of particle diameter, different bonding models and damping models was investigated. The final simulations were evaluated against the experimental results in terms of the draft force and material behaviour. The cause of the draft force reduction due to vibration was also investigated with the aid of the DEM model. From the results it was concluded that DEM is able to model the vibratory <b>subsoiler</b> for its design and optimization. The DEM model also provided valuable insight into the cause of the draft force reduction such as the increased peak stresses due to vibration and the increase in particle kinetic energy...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{can reduce}} crop yields by restricting root development. In-row subsoiling {{is a common}} tillage practice for disrupting the compacted soil profile, allowing roots to proliferate downward to obtain adequate soil moisture. The <b>subsoiler</b> system is composed of many important component s, but the point assembly is the first element to contact the soil and can largely determine the draft requirement and soil disruption of the <b>subsoiler.</b> Two points were evaluated in a soil bin experiment at the USDA-ARS National Soil Dynamics Laboratory in Auburn, AL. A standard ripper point was compared with a ‘splitter point ’ {{which is designed to}} fracture the soil and reduce above-ground soil disruption, especially in dry conditions. The <b>subsoiler</b> system was mounted on a three-dimensional dynamometer where measurements of draft force, vertical force, side force, speed, and depth of operation were determined and tillage power requirements were calculated. Measurements of soil disruption including spoil cross sectional area, trench cross-sectional area and trench specific resistance were determined. Results showed that the splitter point required significantly greater drawbar power (28 %) compared to standard ripper point the while disturbing similar amounts of below-ground soil. However, the splitter point did reduce the above-ground soil disruption by more than 10 %. The splitter point was helpful in reducing above-ground disruption but the added energy cost could be prohibitive for many producers...|$|E
40|$|The {{rotary tiller}} slot planter {{of the present}} {{invention}} comprises a <b>subsoiler</b> shank positioned to engage the soil and make a trench therein. A pair of rotary tiller blades are rotatably mounted on the opposite sides of the sub-soil shank in planes parallel thereto. The center-lines of the rotary tiller wheels are located behind the subsoil shank. Each of the wheels have a plurality of blades extending radially outwardly from the rotational axis thereof and terminating in outer radial ends which engage the soil slightly ahead of the <b>subsoiler</b> shank and adjacent the lateral edges of the trench. A seed tube shank is positioned behind the <b>subsoiler</b> shank and between the tiller wheels. The seed tube shank has a lower end positioned to extend below the soil surface. A seed tube is positioned behind the seed tube shank for depositing seed in the soil. The rotation of the blades {{on opposite sides of the}} subsoil shank causes the soil to be mechanically aggregated and aerated and helps prepare a seed bed for the seeds. Also, the rotating tiller blades chop the debris which may be along the trench and throw soil backwards so as to cover the planted seed. Shorter rotary blades on the tiller wheels are shaped to throw debris and the upper one-half inch of soil sideways away from the row...|$|E
