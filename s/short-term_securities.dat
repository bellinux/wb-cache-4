5|$|The IMF has {{reported}} that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in <b>short-term</b> <b>securities</b> and in the shadow banking system (particularly the mortgage market and real estate investment trusts). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth {{so as not to}} provoke investor withdrawal.|$|E

Long term assets could include, among other things, residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS), collateralized bond obligation, auto loans, student loans, credit cards securitizations, and bank and corporate bonds.|$|E

In the meantime, {{there has been}} a redefinition of the State of Yugoslavia and certain authority of the federal institutions were taken by the institutions established in the Republic of Montenegro. Following the adoption of the Law on Securities, pursuant to its terms, the Montenegro Stock Exchange was recapitalized through the issue of new shares. After taking authority from Federal Commission of Yugoslavia for the Securities and Financial Markets, in December 2000, the Commission for Securities of the Republic of Montenegro, has given, after determining the fulfillment of all the necessary preconditions, the Montenegro Stock Exchange a business license. In the period from 1994 to 2000,the Montenegro Stock Exchange traded mostly gyro money and <b>short-term</b> <b>securities,</b> as it was allowed by the existing legislation. The first brokerage houses in Montenegro were established in 1996, and those were CG Broker, Holder broker and Monte Adria Broker. The transfer of authority of regulating securities markets from the Former Republic of Yugoslavia to its member states required the adoption of the Montenegrin Law on Securities, which did not regulate the issue of <b>short-term</b> <b>securities</b> or trading with them. In this manner, following the adoption of the aforementioned Law, in Montenegro Stock Exchange are trading long-term debt and equity securities.|$|E

There may be a mezzanine tranche rated A. The senior debt is a pari passu combination of medium-term notes (MTN) and commercial paper (CP). The junior debt traditionally comprises puttable, rolling 10-year bonds, but shorter maturities and bullet notes became more common.|$|E

The trust allows the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Office of Food for Peace (FFP) {{to respond to}} food crises in other countries and release and use funds for famine relief in cases where other resources are not available. Since it not longer holds commodities, it can respond to local food crises outside the US, but not to a global one that affects the USA itself. The trust is still active as of 2017.|$|E
50|$|The {{risks that}} arise {{are the same}} that Banks have always faced: First, the {{solvency}} of the SIV {{may be at risk}} if the value of the long-term security that the SIV has bought falls below that of the <b>short-term</b> <b>securities</b> that the SIV has sold. Banks typically avoid this risk by not marking to market their loan portfolios. Second, there is a liquidity risk, as the SIV borrows short term and invests long term; i.e., outpayments become due before the inpayments are due. Unless the borrower can refinance short-term at favorable rates, he may be forced to sell the asset into a depressed market.|$|E

All river patrol responsibility belongs to the Fluvial Police (Cục Cảnh sát giao thông đường thủy - Bureau code:C25), supervised by provincial and/or local police office (Ministry of Public Safety - Bộ Công An), and sometimes to the Vietnam Customs (Hải Quan), depending on the particular geographical responsibility (fluvial or fresh water only).|$|R

40|$|Ensuring energy {{security}} {{has been at}} the centre of the IEA mission since its inception, following the oil crises of the early 1970 s. While the security of oil supplies remains important, contemporary {{energy security}} policies must address all energy sources and cover a a comprehensive range of natural, economic and political risks that affect energy sources, infrastructures and services. In response to this challenge, the IEA is currently developing a Model Of <b>Short-term</b> Energy <b>Security</b> (MOSES) to evaluate the energy security risks and resilience capacities of its member countries. The current version of MOSES covers <b>short-term</b> <b>security</b> of supply for primary energy sources and secondary fuels among IEA countries. It also lays the foundation for analysis of vulnerabilities of electricity and end-use energy sectors. MOSES contains a novel approach to analysing energy security, which can be used to identify energy security priorities, {{as a starting point for}} national energy security assessments and to track the evolution of a country's energy security profile. By grouping together countries with similar "energy security profiles", MOSES depicts the energy security landscape of IEA countries. By extending the MOSES methodology to electricity security and energy services in the future, the IEA aims to develop a comprehensive policy-relevant perspective on global energy security. ...|$|R
