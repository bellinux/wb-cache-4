5000|$|At {{the outset}} of the 110th Congress, Chairman Robert Byrd and Chairman Dave Obey, his {{counterpart}} on the House Appropriations Committee, developed a committee reorganization plan that provided for common <b>subcommittee</b> <b>structures</b> between both houses, a move that the both chairmen hope will allow Congress to [...] "complete action on each of the government funding on time {{for the first time since}} 1994." [...] The subcommittees were last overhauled between the 107th and 108th Congresses, after the creation of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security and again during the 109th Congress, when the number of subcommittees was reduced from 13 to 12.|$|R
50|$|General {{requirements}} for establishing subcommittees are established in House or Senate rules, but specifics {{with respect to}} subcommittee assignments and their jurisdiction are left up to the parent committees. Committees have wide latitude to increase or decrease the number of subcommittees from one congress to the next, including renaming or reassigning jurisdiction among previous subcommittees. Some committees, like the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, often retain a predictable <b>subcommittee</b> <b>structure</b> from year to year, due to the set duties of each subcommittee in drafting annual spending bills. However, even these committees are not immune to organizational changes. New subcommittees on Homeland Security were created in 2003 to handle funding for the Department of Homeland Security, and underwent a joint reorganization during the 110th Congress to better coordinate annual appropriations between the House and Senate.|$|R
25|$|By the mid-1960s, this Termination {{philosophy}} was in decline as a failed {{policy and the}} Congress began to include Native tribes in legislation designed to rebuild the social infrastructure of the Nation and provide economic opportunities for economically depressed areas. In the early 1970s the Termination era was decisively ended with {{the enactment of the}} Menominee Restoration Act of 1973. Although a number of important legislative initiatives affecting Natives were enacted in the early 1970s, {{it became clear that the}} existing <b>subcommittee</b> <b>structure</b> was not providing an adequate forum for legislating appropriate solutions to problems confronting Native country. Legislative jurisdiction over Native affairs was fragmented among a number of committees. Overall, more than 10 committees in the Congress were responsible for Indian affairs, a situation which resulted in a sometimes disjointed treatment of Native affairs and in an often haphazard development of Federal Native policy.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) takes the lead or a significant supporting security role {{in many of}} the nation's most celebrated events across the country. Major events that receive the official designation of a national special security event and those rated Level 1 on the DHS special event rating scale share the same <b>subcommittee</b> planning <b>structure.</b> This thesis focuses on the potential vulnerabilities and gaps in the planning process due to groupthink and other organizational and individual decision-making pitfalls. This thesis then reviews what, if any, potential improvements can be made to the process with the formal adoption of a red team component. This thesis examines the potential benefits of incorporating red team techniques, such as simulation exercises, vulnerability probes, and analytical analysis into major-event security planning. Research indicates that their effectiveness varied on the organizational leadership, team composition, and independence afforded these teams in the performance of their assignment. The process of red teaming is vulnerable to being marginalized without proper organizational support. Armed with this knowledge, this thesis proposes two recommendations for the formal adoption of red team techniques into the subcommittee process of major-event security planning.

50|$|The fallout {{radiation}} {{advice in}} Protect and Survive {{was based on}} 1960s fallout shelter experiments summarized by Daniel T. Jones of the Home Office Scientific Advisory Branch in his report, The Protection Against Fallout Radiation Afforded by Core Shelters in a Typical British House {{which was published in}} Protective Structures for Civilian Populations, Proceedings of the Symposium held at Washington, D.C., April 19-23, 1965, by the <b>Subcommittee</b> on Protective <b>Structures,</b> Advisory Committee on Civil Defense, U.S. National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council. The fallout radiation was represented by measurements of the penetration of cobalt-60 gamma radiation, which has a high mean energy of 1.25 MeV (two gamma rays, 1.17 and 1.33 MeV). This is considerably more penetrating than the mean 0.7 MeV of fallout gamma rays. Therefore, the actual protection given against real nuclear weapon fallout would be far greater than that afforded in the peacetime cobalt-60 shielding measurements.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of Jamie Unwin's Master's in Environmental Studies (Planning) Major Project. It was {{conducted}} over a twelve-month period and designed to explore the validity and capacity for the Canadian Institute of Planning (CIP) to facilitate a national Planning for Food Systems Platform to help spur the shift of the food system 1 toward sustainability and health, required for food secure 2 Canadian communities. This shift is necessary because the current dominant food system is incapable of fostering healthy sustianable food systems 3 as it undermines the very environmental, social and economic resources that our food systems depend upon (Mendes, 2008; Potukuchi &Kaufman, 2000; Wittman, Desmarais & Wiebe, 2011; Le Vallee, 2008). The results of this research clearly highlight the validity and capacity of CIP to facilitate a national planning for food systems platform that engages with the complexity of food systems from an interdisciplinary collaborative approach involving knowledge sharing, networking, and professional development. Due to this, this report has been designed to explain and provide background information for further consultation on: the validity and capacity of CIP to facilitate this platform and to adopt 'Food Systems' as a "topic" on their website. This platform focuses on planning for food systems 4 through the lens of the profession of planning, whereas food system planning is about the design and management of the entire food system itself. The term platform 5 was used because it provided for exploration of alternative ways to engage with planning for food systems within and outside of the existing <b>subcommittee</b> <b>structure</b> of CIP's National Initiatives Advisory Committee. A food systems framework has been used as the professional discourse (OPPI, 2011; Wegener, Seasons & Raine, 2013; MacRae & Donahue, 2013; Hodgson, 2012; RTPI, 2010) and the key food system actors interviewed see it as necessary for fostering the innovation required to plan for sustainable healthy food secure communities. This report is rooted in Participatory Action Research (Rennie & Singh, 1995) as I was a CIP Board Member in the position of Student Representative, conducting twenty-six interviews with key planning for food systems actors from across Canada, CIP Board Members and CIP Staff, completing a preliminary literature review on the planning discourse on food systems, and developing a variety of annotated bibliographies on planning for food systems, the results of which {{can be found in the}} appendices of this report. The links between planning and food systems have been made by numerous planning organizations including the Ontario Professional Planners Institute, the Commonwealth Association of Planners, the Royal Town Planning Institute and the American Planning Association. (See Appendix A for a list of planning institute reports on planning for food systems.) However, in spite of all this, many Canadian planners and members of the general public do not have a strong understanding of the multifunctional synergies planning has with food systems change and how to utilize these to achieve existing planning goals such as sustainable community development (Personal Communication: Wayne Roberts PhD., food policy analyst & former Manager of the Toronto Food Policy Council (TFPC), April 02, 2014; Lauren Baker PhD, current Coordinator/Manager of the TPFC May 05, 2014; Janine de la Salle Registered Professional Planner (RPP) and leader in planning for food systems, April 03, 2014; Rod MacRae PhD, food policy analyst & leader in food systems thinking, May 09, 2014; Kimberley Hodgson RPP and leader in planning for food systems, May 06, 2014; and, John Turvey RPP, co-founder of Planning for Agriculture and Food Network (PAFN) & Policy specialist on land use planning for the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, March 24, 2014). Please see Appendix B for a list of individuals Interviewed and their relevant background information. Wegener et al, supports the need for planners to have increased access to networking, knowledge sharing and professional development with their statement that "food system considerations are relatively new to planners. There is a need to examine the current policies and practices that may be hindering supportive local planning activity. " (2013, p 94) This report explores: • The history and importance of CIP and Provincial and Territorial Institutes and Associations (PTIAs) engaging with food systems, and engagement from similar organizations such as the American Planning Association (APA), the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI), and the Commonwealth Association of lanners (CAP); • Why a Platform is Needed Under the Aegis of CIP; • The multifunctional ways that a Planning for Food Systems platform fits CIP's recently accepted Articles of Continuance and the associated Consensus Statement, CIP's Strategic Plan and CIP's National Initiatives Committee Mandate; • The benefits of a CIP based platform to support members and the planning community on the emerging topic of planning for food systems; • The willingness and capacity of CIP's membership to support planning for food systems knowledge sharing, networking and professional development; • Potential Platform Activities and Outputs; • Current Projects for Potential Partnership; • Potential Topic Areas for Exploration by a CIP Planning for Food Systems Platform and partnership opportunities, particularly the Planning for Agriculture and Food Network (PAFN); • Key platform organizational elements; • Key qualities and skill sets of potential platform committee members; • Key groups to consult with; • Potential ways to increase capacity through the organizational design of the platform; and, • Suggested next steps for developing a proposal to CIP for the implementation of a Planning for Food Systems Platform in the form of a CIP Subcommittee. The research explored in this report clearly shows that as a national organization representative of the planning profession CIP should develop the role of planners in food systems and support the validity of planning for food systems. As such undertakings help CIP fulfill its vision of "Improved quality of life through excellence in professional planning," its mission "to advance planning in Canada and abroad by serving, educating, informing and engaging our members," and CIP values of "integrity, innovation, (and) collaboration. " (CIP, 2014, a) CIP's new Articles of Continuance were accepted by its membership and enacted on July 07, 2014 at CIP's Annual General Meeting in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Then Articles changed CIP's name from the Canadian Institute of Planners to the Canadian Institute of Planning. Within the articles was an approved Consensus Statement which speaks to CIP's primary purpose being "to promote and advance the value of planning in Canada. " (2014, b) This report explains how the proposed platform supports the renewal of CIP and its ability to achieve its primary purpose. Based on an organizational analysis, participation in the Board of Directors, and interviews with twenty-six key actors all of whom agree that CIP should be engaging with food systems, I conclude that the capacity and validity exist for CIP to facilitate a national planning for food systems platform and through this provide knowledge sharing, networking, and professional development...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of the {{research}} was on innovative ways of engaging stakeholders in managing droughts. The research focused on Mutoko districtâ€™s wards fourteen, fifteen and eighteen which are naturally drought prone areas in the district. The research was aimed at establishing an effective way of managing droughts in the district, identifying and assessing the impacts of droughts in the district, assessing the capacity of institutions responsible for managing droughts in the district and assessing the coping strategies {{that are used to}} manage droughts by the indigenous people themselves as well as those provided by institutions. The research also sought to provide recommendations to stakeholder engagement and other problems that are faced in managing droughts in the district. The word drought was contextualised and conceptualised in this research â€“ that is the provision of {{the meaning of the word}} drought, classification of droughts as meteorological, hydrological, agricultural and socio-economical; an outline of the causes of droughts which are natural and human factors and effects of droughts. The drought management processes and approaches â€“ which included a discussion on the proactive and reactive drought management approach, the ten step drought management planning process and management of droughts in Zimbabwe, were also discussed. The stakeholdersâ€™ engagement process as a vital tool in drought management and empirical case studies on successful drought management in which stakeholder engagement was a key factor â€“ that is the case study of the State of Nebraska in the United States of America and case study of Rajasthan in India were also given. As such the research subscribed to a descriptive approach of doing a research. Stratified random, simple random and purposive sampling techniques were employed to come up with a total of seventy two respondents. Stratified sampling was used to come up with five strata of respondents, the householders, traditional leaders, agritex officers, councilors, and key district informants. Simple random sampling was then used to pick householders, agritex officers and traditional leaders (village heads) whereas purposive sampling was used to pick up councilors, traditional leaders (chiefs) and key district informants. A participatory appraisal modus operandi â€“ Focus Group Discussion â€“ was used to elicit data from householders, questionnaires with both closed and open ended questions were used for key district informants and agritex officers and an interview guide was used to get data from traditional leaders, councilors and one of key district informants. A total of sixty two respondents have provided data, for this research, which has been analyzed and presented in tabulations and narratives. The results of the research reflected that there are various impacts of droughts which affect Mutoko district. The results also revealed that the capacity of the drought relief committee is very weak, so as the institutional drought coping strategies. The district drought relief committee lacks resources and proper skill to proactively manage droughts and has weak stakeholder engagement mechanisms which exacerbate the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the institution. There are no effective ways of engaging stakeholders to ensure that a tight fit is maintained between the District Drought Relief Committee and various stakeholders. The committee does not have <b>subcommittee</b> and prerequisite <b>structures</b> at village and ward level to complement district drought relief committeeâ€™s efforts and initiate drought management at the lowest level where droughts affect people. To this matter the drought management approach in place has been found as reactive which is very weak and causes the district to respond to droughts than prepare for them thus making people to suffer from droughts which can be avoided. A proactive drought management approach was thus established as the most effective way that can be used to manage droughts. The household coping strategies have however been found effective. Innovative ways of engaging stakeholders that were identified include the use of working groups, websites, publications, newsletters, surveys and web 2. 0 tools and among others. Recommendations that have been given include that the district drought relief committee must always be active at any given time of the year, create sub â€“ committees and village and ward drought committees, strengthen the stakeholder engagement process and use a variety of engagement methods so as to identify new and keep in touch with knowledgeable and resourceful stakeholders and among others...|$|R
