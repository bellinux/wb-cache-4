40|$|The {{widening}} {{gap between}} processors and memory necessitates {{the development of}} novel memory hierarchies: hierarchies that can possibly <b>service</b> <b>memory</b> references at register speeds, since service at cache speeds may not be adequate. We consider {{the design of a}} novel memory hierarchy component, a knapsack, whose purpose is to provide (very) fast access to frequently-used data objects. Software allocates frequently-used objects into a knapsack region of the address space; a knapsack provides fast access (at register speeds in many cases) to these objects. We discuss how a knapsack is different from other memory hierarchy components, how it can achieve superior performance over other components, and how it can be integrated transparently into an implementation of existing architectures. We also carry out a detailed evaluation of a knapsack using several of the SPEC 92 benchmark programs. Our results show that for many programs, both numeric and non-numeric, the knapsack offers significant [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Memory {{bandwidth}} is {{a crucial}} resource in computing systems. Current CMP/SMT processors have {{a significant number of}} cores and they can run many threads concurrently. This large thread count adds high pressure to the memory bus, which demands high bandwidth to <b>service</b> <b>memory</b> requests from the cores. Hardware data prefetching is a well-known technique for hiding memory latency. Due to its speculative nature, however, in some situations prefetching does not effectively work, wasting memory bandwidth and polluting the caches. Data prefetching efficiency depends on the prefetching algorithm. It also depends on the characteristics of the applications running on the system. In this paper we propose an online bandwidth shifting mechanism that dynamically assigns bandwidth to applications according to their prefetch efficiency. This mechanism maximizes the utilization of memory bandwidth, thereby improving system performance and/or reducing memory power consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this solution is the first to not require hardware support. We evaluate the benefits of using our bandwidth shifting mechanism on a real system - the IBM POWER 7. We obtain speedups in the order of 10 - 20...|$|E
40|$|Since a few years, {{flat screen}} TVs, such as LCD and plasma, {{has come to}} completelydominate the market of televisions. In a SoC {{solution}} for digital TVs, severalprocessors are used to obtain a decent image quality. Some of the processorsneed temporal information, which means that whole frames need to be storedin memory, which in turn motivates the use of SDRAM memory. When higherdemands of resolution and image quality arrives, greater pressure is put on theperformance of the SoC memory subsystem, to not become a bottleneck of thesystem. In this master thesis project, a model of an existing SoC for digital TVs is usedto benchmark and evaluate the performance of an SDRAM memory controllerarchitecture study. The two major features are the ability to reorder transactionsand the compatibility with DDR 3. By introducing reordering of transactions, thechoice {{is given to the}} memory controller to <b>service</b> <b>memory</b> requests in an orderthat decreases bank conflicts and read/write turn arounds. Measurements showthat a utilization of 86. 5 % of the total available bandwidth can be achieved, whichis 18. 5 percentage points more, compared to an existing nonreordering memorycontroller developed by NXP...|$|E
40|$|DRAM memory systems require {{periodic}} recharging {{to avoid}} loss {{of data from}} leaky capacitors. These refresh operations consume energy and reduce the duration of time for which the DRAM banks are available to <b>service</b> <b>memory</b> requests. Higher DRAM density and 3 D-stacking aggravate the refresh overheads, incurring even higher energy and performance costs. 3 D-stacked DRAM and other emerging on chip High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) technologies which are widely considered to be changing the landscape of memory hierarchy in future heterogeneous and many-core architectures could suffer significantly from refresh overheads. Such large on-chip memory, when used as a very large last level cache, however, provides opportunities for addressing the refresh overheads. In this work, we propose MicroRefresh, a scheme for almost eliminating the refresh overhead in DRAM caches. MicroRefresh eliminates unwanted refresh of recently accessed DRAM pages; it {{takes advantage of the}} relative latency difference between on-chip and off-chip DRAM and achieves a fine balance of usage of system resources by aggressively opportunistically eliminating refresh of older DRAM pages. It tolerates any resulting increase in cache misses by leveraging the under-utilized main memory bandwidth. The resulting organization eliminates the energy and performance overhead of refresh operations in the DRAM cache to achieve overall performance and energy improvement. Across both 4 -core and 8 -core workloads, MicroRefresh eliminates 92 % the refresh energy consumed in the baseline periodic refresh mechanism. Further this is accompanied by performance improvements of upto 10 %, with average improvements of 3. 9 % and 3. 4 % in 4 -core and 8 -core respectively...|$|E

40|$|The Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation of Health and Illness has {{previously}} been applied to people with early-stage dementia. This suggests that people hold ‘illness representations’ of cognitive perceptions of their health condition. Illness representations develop from lay knowledge, current experience and information from external sources. Recent studies have highlighted that people with early-stage dementia have unmet information needs and require individually tailored information about aspects of dementia which are important to them. Professionals require a way to identify what people with early-stage dementia feel {{they do not understand}} about their dementia. Thus, the current study investigated whether illness representations might provide a mechanism for identifying the information needs of eight people with early-stage Alzheimer’s or mixed dementia attending a National Health <b>Service</b> <b>memory</b> clinic. An important feature of illness representations is whether they allow someone to form a coherent understanding of their condition, the ‘coherence’ of their illness representation. For the current study, the definition of coherence was adapted to match research aims, allowing the investigation of particular aspects of dementia people felt they did not understand using semi-structured interviews. A novel feature of this approach was using explicit prompts about what participants felt they understood or did not understand about each area of their illness representation to help illustrate how lack of understanding could contribute to absence of coherence. Interview transcripts were subject to framework analysis which showed that participants could identify things which they did not understand about their dementia and aspects of dementia they would like to know more about. Broad areas of dementia were identified which several people wanted to know about, along with idiosyncratic information needs. For some participants, illness representations, informed by medical stereotypes, appeared to limit their awareness of possible psychosocial support. Strengths, limitations and recommendations for research and practice were discussed...|$|E
