5000|$|The field {{draws upon}} {{multiple}} theoretical perspectives and research paradigms {{to understand the}} complexities associated with human learning, cognition, and development. Researchers in the interdisciplinary field of learning sciences, born during the 1990s, study learning as it happens in real-life situations and how to better facilitate learning in designed environments - in school, online, in the workplace, at home, and in informal environments. Learning sciences research is guided by constructivist, social-constructivist, <b>socio-cognitive,</b> and socio-cultural theories of learning.|$|E

5000|$|Knowledge {{building}} {{refers to}} the process of creating new cognitive artifacts as a result of common goals, group discussions, and synthesis of ideas. These pursuits should advance the current understanding of individuals within a group, at a level beyond their initial knowledge level, and should be directed towards advancing the understanding of what is known about that topic or idea.

50|$|Emergent {{interactive}} agency defines Bandura's view of agencies, where human {{agency can}} be exercised through direct personal agency. Bandura formulates {{his view of}} agency as a <b>socio-cognitive</b> one, where people are self-organizing, proactive, self-regulating, and engage in self-reflection, and are not just reactive organisms shaped and shepherded by external events. People {{have the power to}} influence their own actions to produce certain results. The capacity to exercise control over one’s thought processes, motivation, affect, and action operates through mechanisms of personal agency. Such agencies are emergent and interactive, apply perspectives of social cognition, and make causal contributions to its own motivations and actions using ‘reciprocal causation’.|$|E
50|$|Some {{decisions}} are {{difficult because of}} the need to take into account how other people in the situation will respond to the decision that is taken. The analysis of such social decisions is more often treated under the label of game theory, rather than decision theory, though it involves the same mathematical methods. From the standpoint of game theory most of the problems treated in decision theory are one-player games (or the one player is viewed as playing against an impersonal background situation). In the emerging <b>socio-cognitive</b> engineering, the research is especially focused on the different types of distributed decision-making in human organizations, in normal and abnormal/emergency/crisis situations.|$|E
5000|$|Symbolic {{modeling}} {{evolved from}} the computer science paradigms using the technologies of Knowledge-based systems, {{as well as a}} philosophical perspective, see for example [...] "Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence" [...] (GOFAI).

Recently, especially in the context of cognitive decision making, symbolic cognitive modeling is extended to <b>socio-cognitive</b> approach including social and organization cognition interrelated with a sub-symbolic not conscious layer.|$|E
50|$|After {{a number}} of members have shifted their opinion {{to agree with the}} {{minority}} group, that minority becomes a majority. This is known as the snowball effect. When a minority creates social change in society, the new view becomes {{an integral part of the}} society's culture. This results in the source of the minority influence that led to change being forgotten, which is known as social cryptoamnesia.Minority influence can be successful if people can dissociate between the <b>socio-cognitive</b> activities of resistance that are induced by the source and other activities of resistance that develop from the content of the message. The process of dissociation is explained by social cryptoamnesia: what was originally considered different is gradually constructed as an alternative (Perez, 1995).|$|E
5000|$|In this book, Reynolds and his {{collaborators}} explore relationships between intermedial theater, consciousness, memory, objects, subjectivity, and affect through productive engagement with the performance aesthetics, <b>socio-cognitive</b> theory, and critical methodology of transversal poetics alongside other leading philosophical approaches to performance. Intermedial Theater offers the first sustained analysis {{of the work of}} Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, Jean Baudrillard, and Friedrich Nietzsche in relation to the contemporary European theater of Jan Lauwers and Needcompany, Romeo Castellucci and Socìetas Raffaello Sanzio, Thomas Ostermeier, Rodrigo García and La Carnicería Teatro, and the Transversal Theater Company. It connects contemporary uses of objects, simulacra, and technologies in both posthumanist discourse and postdramatic theater to the transhistorically and culturally mediating power of Shakespeare as a means by which to discuss the affective impact of intermedial theater on today’s audiences.|$|E
5000|$|Second, in {{addition}} to the expansion of the genre, textual analysis has moved contrastive rhetoric to emphasize the social situation of writing. [...] Today, writing is increasingly regarded as being socially situated; each situation may entail special consideration to audience, purposes, level of perfection, and correspondingly may require varying amounts of revision, collaboration, and attention to detail. The expectations and norms of discourse communities or communities of practice (cultural and disciplinary) may shape these situational expectations and practices. This is where contrastive rhetoric overlaps with social constructionism, which sees approaches to textual meaning as dynamic, <b>socio-cognitive</b> activities. Instead of analyzing what texts [...] "mean," [...] the interest is to understand how they construct meaning. Bazerman and Prior (2004, p. 6) pose three questions to guide the analysis of writing: ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the study}} of Mouaheb, Fahli, Moussetad and Eljamali an American version of a serious game was investigated: Virtual University. Results showed that {{learning}} using this serious game has educational values {{that are based on}} learning concepts advocated by constructivist psycho-cognitive theories. It guarantees intrinsic motivation, generates cognitive conflicts and provides situated learning. The use of Virtual University allowed the researchers to identify the following key points: from its playfulness combined with video game technologies, the tool was able to motivate learners intrinsically; the simulation game also recreates learning situations extremely close to that of reality, especially considering the complexity, dynamism and all of the interrelations and interactions that exist within the university system. This is a major educational advantage by encouraging 1) an intense interaction that generates real cognitive or <b>socio-cognitive</b> conflicts, providing a solid construction of knowledge; 2) an autonomy in the learning process following a strong metacognitive activity; 3) an eventual transfer of acquired skills.|$|E
50|$|Several {{possibilities}} {{exist for}} how to combat aversive racism. One method looks to the cognitive foundations of prejudice. The basic <b>socio-cognitive</b> process of creating in-groups and out-groups is what leads many to identify with their own race while feeling averted to other races, or out-group members. According to the common ingroup identity model inducing individuals to recategorize themselves and others {{as part of a}} larger, superordinate group can lead to more positive attitudes towards members of a former out-group. Research has shown this model to be effective. This shows that changing the in-group criteria from race to something else that includes both groups, implicit biases can be diminished. It {{is important to note that}} this does not mean that each group has to necessarily relinquish subgroup identities. According to the common ingroup identity model, individuals can retain their original identity while simultaneously harboring a larger more inclusive identity - a dual identity representation.|$|E
