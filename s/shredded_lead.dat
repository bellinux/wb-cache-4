It reached No. 17 on Billboard's Top Contemporary Christian Albums chart. In 2010, HM Magazine listed Whitecross No. 29 on its Top 100 Christian Rock Albums of All Time list stating that [...] "listen to this album. It'll blow your mind. It's simplistic '80s metal {{to a fault}} (think Ratt with Jesus-first lyrics), but the <b>shredding</b> <b>lead</b> guitar by Rex Carroll in every fill, nook and cranny is primo."

500|$|Thrash metal {{emerged in}} the early 1980s under the {{influence}} of hardcore punk and the new wave of British heavy metal, particularly songs in the revved-up style known as speed metal. The movement began in the United States, with Bay Area thrash metal being the leading scene. The sound developed by thrash groups was faster and more aggressive than that of the original metal bands and their glam metal successors. Low-register guitar riffs are typically overlaid with <b>shredding</b> <b>leads.</b> Lyrics often express nihilistic views or deal with social issues using visceral, gory language. Thrash {{has been described as a}} form of [...] "urban blight music" [...] and [...] "a palefaced cousin of rap".|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s metal {{fragmented}} into several subgenres, including thrash metal, {{which developed in}} the US from the style known as speed metal, {{under the influence of}} hardcore punk, with low-register guitar riffs typically overlaid by <b>shredding</b> <b>leads.</b> Lyrics often expressed nihilistic views or deal with social issues using visceral, gory language. It was popularised by the [...] "Big Four of Thrash": Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. Death metal developed out of thrash, particularly influenced by the bands Venom and Slayer. Florida's Death and the Bay Area's Possessed emphasized lyrical elements of blasphemy, diabolism and millenarianism, with vocals usually delivered as guttural [...] "death growls," [...] high-pitched screaming, complemented by downtuned, highly distorted guitars and extremely fast double bass percussion.|$|R
5000|$|New Release Tuesdays Kevin Davis {{wrote that}} [...] "Cold Hard Want is House of Heroes most urgent, most tangible, most undeniable {{artifact}} in their marked career. Hands down. Known for their creativity, House of Heroes has always taken {{pride in their}} ability to blend the experimental and the quirky into hooky, classic-rock-influenced anthems. But with Cold Hard Want, the band has taken the gloves off. Every song has an unavoidable, magnetic chorus. Every moment is desperate. Every track is modern rock, that is hopelessly candid—in the best possible way—complete with bombastic beats, <b>shredding</b> <b>leads,</b> and triumphant riffs. Make no mistake about one thing, however: House of Heroes has not placed their hopes on the fickle fortunes of rock n’ roll. These four realize the fate of their souls cannot be hinged on something so mortal. Faith is—and always has been—the crux of their creation." ...|$|R
500|$|Kill 'Em All {{features}} intricate riffing {{reminiscent of}} the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and <b>shredding</b> <b>leads</b> to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns {{in addition to his}} breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a [...] "naive charm". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock.|$|R

5000|$|... "Ark of Suffering" [...] {{begins with}} a fast and aggressive, full-on thrash metal intro that lasts 6 seconds, {{featuring}} minimalist thrash riffing and d-beat drumming. The music stops for a few seconds, followed by an interlude of just the lead guitar playing, and at 0:19 the drums step in again. The song pauses for a second while the aggressive shouting vocals of Gary Lenaire comes in accompanied by a vocal effect, and the song keeps going with the whole band playing. Lenaire sings: [...] "You think it's alright to destroy God's creation..." [...] At 0:45 the tempo becomes slower, and the melodic baritone vocals of Guy Ritter take place, singing: [...] "Do you think dominate means to kill just for sport..." [...] At 1:14, the tempo becomes faster accompanied by double bass drumming, and Lenaire's shouting vocals replace Ritter again: [...] "Don't you see in their eyes how they trust us..." [...] At 1:36 Ritter's vocals come in for the slower part. At 1:52, Mark Lewis plays a guitar solo, from 2:15 to 2:35 the band plays an aggressive, rhythmic and instrumental interlude, followed by a second virtuoisic guitar solo by Mark Lewis, with Lenaire playing the third solo from 2:55. A calmer interlude starts at 3:14, playing a complex riff till 3:30, when Ritter whispers: [...] "Before they die..." [...] Then with a deep baritone voice: [...] "Who will hear their cry." [...] - [...] with [...] "cry" [...] sang with Ritter's high-pitched and twisted falsetto voice. The guitars play 2 atonal riffs around 3:50, creating an oppressive atmosphere, a <b>shredding</b> <b>lead</b> at 4:00, and the songs ends at 4:14.|$|R
30|$|Historic use/disposal {{of smaller}} volumes such as scrap yards, substations/transformers or <b>shredder</b> plants can <b>lead</b> to PCB {{contamination}} {{and should be}} assessed for their pollution footprint and for potential exposure of food animals. Normally, the impact of such sites is mainly localized to possibly a few 100  m radius. However, certain mechanisms can enlarge the polluted area even of such smaller use/disposal sites. A former PCB-contaminated scrap yard in northern Germany was used for storing horse dung before dispersing on pasture. The pasture area was used for beef cows, resulting in dl-PCB meat contamination above EU maximum limits [17].|$|R

[...] Corgan {{continued}} to support and promote The Frogs by producing a short film, [...] "Meet the Frogs," [...] which he included on the Smashing Pumpkins' 1994 Vieuphoria video compilation. The short film brought the group recognition, {{but it has also}} confused Smashing Pumpkins fans who don't know if they should take the band seriously or not.|$|R
500|$|The fifth track, [...] "Sweating Bullets", shows Mustaine's {{battle with}} his inner selves, which is {{presented}} throughout a conversational singing style. [...] "Sweating Bullets" [...] was written {{during the second}} recording session and was released as the album's third single. Its lyrical theme deals with paranoia. David Ellefson commented that the song's lyrics were [...] "psychotically perfect" [...] and sounded like [...] "the inside of a crazed lunatic's mind". The title track was inspired by environmental concerns {{about the future of}} the planet. The name was suggested by Nick Menza, who had read a story in Time magazine entitled [...] "The Countdown to Extinction". [...] "High Speed Dirt" [...] focuses on skydiving. [...] "Captive Honour" [...] is a song about prison and the consequences of crime, while [...] "Psychotron" [...] was written about the Marvel Comics character Deathlok. The album's closing track, [...] "Ashes in Your Mouth", concentrates on the negative aftermaths of war. The longest tune on the record, it is performed at intense tempo and features <b>shredding</b> guitar <b>leads.</b>|$|R

40|$|At {{the moment}} Automobile Shredder Residue (ASR) is usually {{landfilled}} worldwide, but European draft Directive 2000 / 53 /CE forces {{the development of}} alternative solutions, stating the 95 %-wt recovery of an End of Life Vehicle (ELV) weight to be fulfilled by 2015. This work describes two industrial tests, each involving 250 - 300 t of ELVs, in which different pre-shredding operations were performed. The produced ASR materials underwent an extended characterization and some post-shredding processes, consisting of dimensional, magnetic, electrostatic and densimetric separation phases, were tested on laboratory scale, having as main purpose the enhancement of ASR recovery/recycling and the minimization of the landfilled fraction. The gathered results show that accurate depollution and dismantling operations are mandatory to obtain a high quality ASR material which may be recycled/recovered and partially landfilled according to the actual European Union regulations, with particular concern for Lower Heating Value (LHV), heavy metals content and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) as critical parameters. Moreover post-shredding technical solutions foreseeing minimum economic and engineering efforts, therefore realizable in common European ELVs <b>shredding</b> plants, may <b>lead</b> to multi-purposed (material recovery and thermal valorization) opportunities for ASR reuse/recovery...|$|R
50|$|Kara Zor-El (originally, just Kara; Kryptonians {{during the}} Golden Era used a single name for most women, and a two-syllable name for men; thus the {{addition}} of the patronymic to the female name is a contemporary convention) is the last survivor of Argo City, which had survived the explosion of the planet Krypton and drifted through space. The city had been covered by a plastic dome for weather moderation, devised by Zor-El, the younger brother of Superman's father Jor-El, a climatologist and engineer. The dome held together a large chunk of land mass under the city as it drifted through space {{in the general direction of}} our solar system. However, the bottom-most layers of bedrock were affected by the explosion of the great planet's fissionable core and underwent a slow but steady chain-reaction, turning into green Kryptonite. Using raw deposits and refined materials at hand, the residents of Argo City laid down a ground shield of lead foil to protect them from the developing Kryptonite. Zor-El was also able to fashion a makeshift propulsion system to try to accelerate the city's approach to the Solar System. During the roughly thirty years Argo City traveled through space, Zor-El met and married Alura, daughter of In-Ze, who in turn bore their daughter, Kara—blond like her parents. But before the propulsion system was able to steer the city toward Earth, a deranged citizen named Jer-Em, who was suffering from survival guilt, damaged the exhaust, veering Argo toward a swarm of meteors that crashed into the underside of the land mass on which it rested. As the inhabitants of the colony were being slain by the green Kryptonite radiation released by meteorites <b>shredding</b> the <b>lead</b> barrier, the adolescent Kara was sent to Earth by her father Zor-El in a rocket, to be raised by her cousin Kal-El (Superman). Fearing that she might not be recognized by Superman, Kara's parents provided her with a uniform which was closely based on the one Kal was wearing as the Man of Steel.|$|R
40|$|A set of HI sources {{extracted}} from the north Galactic polar region by the ongoing ALFALFA survey has properties {{that are consistent with}} the interpretation that they are associated with isolated minihalos in the outskirts of the Local Group (LG). Unlike objects detected by previous surveys, such as the Compact High Velocity Clouds of Braun & Burton (1999), the HI clouds found by ALFALFA do not violate any structural requirements or halo scaling laws of the LambdaCDM structure paradigm, nor would they have been detected by extant HI surveys of nearby galaxy groups other than the LG. At a distance of d Mpc, their HI masses range between $ 5 x 10 ^ 4 d^ 2 and 10 ^ 6 d^ 2 solar and their HI radii between < 0. 4 d and 1. 6 d kpc. If they are parts of gravitationally bound halos, the total masses would be on order of 10 ^ 8 [...] 10 ^ 9 solar, their baryonic content would be signifcantly smaller than the cosmic fraction of 0. 16 and present in a ionized gas phase of mass well exceeding that of the neutral phase. This study does not however prove that the minihalo interpretation is unique.

According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a [...] "naive charm". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. [...] "Hit the Lights" [...] was based on an unfinished Leather Charm song written by Hetfield and Hugh Tanner. Hetfield had brought the majority of the song to Ulrich, and the two worked out different arrangements. Performed at 160 beats per minute, [...] "Hit the Lights" [...] opens with fade-in distorted guitars and a short shriek by Hetfield. The song is driven by the 16th note repeated main riff and the continuous eighth note snare drum hits. The lyrics celebrate heavy metal itself and are sung with short and high pitched vocals. The song ends with several lengthy guitar solos by Hammett, who performed cleaner and more melodic versions of Mustaine's leads. [...] "The Four Horsemen" [...] is a revamp of the Mustaine-penned [...] "The Mechanix", which originally had lyrics about having sex at a gas station. A modified version of his composition with the original lyrics appeared on Megadeth's debut Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985). Although Mustaine told Metallica not to use any of his music, Hetfield wrote lyrics about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and added a bridge and cleanly picked guitar solo in the middle. Mustaine said the bridge was inspired by the main riff in Lynyrd Skynyrd's [...] "Sweet Home Alabama". [...] "Motorbreath" [...] was written by Hetfield during his time in Leather Charm and tells about life on the road. The song is based on a four-chord verse and a stop-and-start chorus. The most recognizable parts are Ulrich's drum rolls in each chorus and the riff that accompanies Hammett's solos. Because of its speed, the song requires fast picking by the bassist. [...] "Jump in the Fire" [...] was originally written by Mustaine, with lyrics about teenage sexual experience. Hetfield's revised lyrics for the album were written from Satan's point of view, describing how the devil watches people killing each other, and is sure they will go to hell for their actions. [...] "Jump in the Fire" [...] was released as a single in the UK in February 1984 to promote a UK tour with Venom. The single featured [...] "Phantom Lord" [...] and [...] "Seek & Destroy" [...] as live tracks, although they are actually studio recordings with fake crowd noise dubbed over them. The single's cover art features an oil painting titled The Devils of D-Day, created by artist Les Edwards in 1978. [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] is a bass solo by Burton, accompanied on drums by Ulrich. A staple of Burton's live performances since his high school days in the band Agents of Misfortune, the instrumental track featured Burton's distinctive [...] "lead-bass" [...] style of playing, incorporating heavy distortion, use of wah-wah pedal and tapping. Bubacz introduces the track as [...] "Bass solo, take one", informing listeners that the song was recorded in one take. [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] was the bass solo that Burton was playing when Hetfield and Ulrich first saw him at a gig. Hetfield stated: [...] "We heard this wild solo going on and thought, 'I don't see any guitar player up there.' We were both counting the strings and I finally turned to Lars and said, 'Dude, that's a bass!' Cliff was up there on stage with his band Trauma with a wah-wah pedal and his huge mop of red hair. He didn't care whether people were there. He was looking down at his bass, playing." [...] "Whiplash" [...] was the album's first single, issued on August 8, 1983. It features a swift rhythm line of straight 16th notes played at about 200 beats per minute. Hetfield and Burton performed with palm muted technique and precise metronomic control. The lyrics celebrate crowd energy and headbanging. Rock journalist Mick Wall wrote that [...] "Whiplash" [...] signified the birth of thrash metal, stating: [...] "If one wishes to identify the very moment thrash metal arrived spitting and snarling into the world, 'Whiplash' is indisputably it." [...] "Phantom Lord" [...] is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. [...] "No Remorse" [...] is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. [...] "Seek & Destroy" [...] was inspired by Diamond Head's [...] "Dead Reckoning" [...] and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. [...] "Metal Militia", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity. Mustaine composed the main riff, which emulates a marching army. The song ends with tramping feet and bullet ricochet in a fade-out.|$|R
5000|$|In City at War, {{due to the}} {{injuries}} he sustained from Splinter, Shredder has been confined to a hospital bed {{under the care of}} Stockman with Bebop and Rocksteady as his bodyguards. When Tiger Claw returns to report the loss of an entire weapons cache thanks to the Turtles and Karai back in Manhattan, making it clear Karai wants to take Shredder down one piece at a time by destroying his criminal empire before taking him out, Shredder decrees that if it's a war Karai wants, it's a war she'll get, before Stockman hooks an I.V. filled with mutagen up to Shredder, and as the mutagen is injected into Shredder, his eyes open wide as the mutagen takes effect. In The Insecta Trifecta, Shredder is still receiving the mutagen drip as he now turns to Stockman as his last hope due to his undying loyalty since Tiger Claw and the others have become useless as of late in stopping Karai and the Turtles. When Stockman returns to report his mission a failure, Shredder is not worried about it, revealing to Stockman that his mutagen drip is finally taking effect as Shredder deploys a pair of blades {{from the back of his}} hand, right out of the skin itself. In [...] "The Super Shredder" [...] Shredder forces Stockman to give him the rest of the mutagen drip, which mutated him into his Super Shredder form, although it ended up monstrous he was still pleased. Shredder then collects his henchmen and travels back to his old lair. Karai tries to fight the Shredder along with Shinigami but Shredder easily knocks Shinigami unconscious and he escapes with Karai. He then notices a van coming straight towards him, (The Shell Raiser) and flips it over. He tells the turtles to have splinter meet him at the place that he last beat him. Shredder then sets the vehicle on fire and the turtles flee to the sewers. Shredder then creates a trap for Splinter and the Turtles, which is full of photos of Splinter, Tang Shen, and Karai. When Splinter enters he drops bars of iron to avoid them from escaping. He then light fire towards them but they jump underwater. As the Turtles, Splinter, and April continue to approach Shredder, Karai makes a remark and Splinter follows, but later finds out he was led into another trap. Shredder forces Splinter to fight him but Splinter escapes, ready to set up a plan of his own. Splinter <b>leads</b> <b>Shredder</b> to the Undercity, where he puts his plan into action. Shredder eventually finds Splinter and he steps on his tail. Shredder then takes Splinter deeper into the UnderCity, where he decides to finish him. Just as Shredder was about to strike Splinter, his arm started to lose control, causing him to step back. Splinter then throws a blade at a few gas tanks and both Splinter and Shredder fall to their deaths. However, in the following episode, [...] "Darkest Plight", Shredder and Splinter are separated during the fall, and Shredder returns to the top of the Under-city to be rescued by Tiger Claw, who takes him back to recover before hunting down the Turtles. While Tiger Claw deals with April and Karai, Shredder goes after Leonardo, and nearly crushes him to death before Karai and April arrive to help. During the battle, Shredder tosses a wrecked fuel tanker semi-truck at Karai, only for April to catch it in her psychic grip, causing her Sol Star crystal to cause her eyes to glow blue and smile malevolently before hurling it back at Shredder. However, before Shredder can kill Leo, Karai pleads with him to reconsider doing something good in his life instead of being consumed by his vengeance. This lures Shredder in close enough for Karai to hit him in his most vulnerable spot: His exposed, pulsating mutated heart. Weakened, Shredder is saved by Tiger Claw, who drives him back to their hideout, where Shredder demands a larger dose of the mutagen from Stockman. When Tiger Claw objects, knowing it is too dangerous, Shredder overpowers him, forces Stockman to administer the dosage and roars as the mutagen takes effect as Tiger Claw watches in horror and fear. In [...] "Tale of Tiger Claw", he is shown as a M.O.U.S.E.R. hologram to warn Tiger Claw of his next move against Splinter.|$|R
