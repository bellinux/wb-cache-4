5|$|Although {{the most}} stable isotope of fermium is 257Fm, with a {{half-life}} of 100.5days, most studies are conducted on 255Fm (t1/2= 20.07(7)hours), <b>since</b> <b>this</b> isotope can be easily isolated as required as the decay product of 255Es (t1/2= 39.8(12)days).|$|E
5|$|Early {{designs in}} the 1940s and 1950s started by using steel as a {{resonator}} material. This {{has given way}} to nickel-iron alloys, primarily to maximise the Q <b>since</b> <b>this</b> is often the primary appeal of mechanical filters rather than price. Some of the metals that have been used for mechanical filter resonators and their Q are shown in the table.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>since</b> <b>this</b> initial skepticism, {{biologists}} {{have come to}} a consensus that declines in amphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity. This consensus emerged with {{an increase in the number}} of studies that monitored amphibian populations, direct observation of mass mortality in pristine sites that lacked apparent cause, and an awareness that declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature.|$|E

5|$|It {{is common}} to reduce a wood sample to just the {{cellulose}} component before testing, but <b>since</b> <b>this</b> can reduce {{the volume of the}} sample to 20% of its original size, testing of the whole wood is often performed as well. Charcoal is often tested but is likely to need treatment to remove contaminants.|$|E
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates' {{bodies and}} {{appendages}} {{are covered with}} a tough cuticle made mainly of chitin and chemically hardened proteins. <b>Since</b> <b>this</b> cannot stretch, the animals must molt to grow. In other words, they grow new but still soft cuticles, then cast off the old one {{and wait for the}} new one to harden. Until the new cuticle hardens the animals are defenseless and almost immobilized.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{influenza}} {{can cause}} severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia. The obvious symptom is trouble breathing. In addition, {{if a child}} (or presumably an adult) {{seems to be getting}} better and then relapses with a high fever, that is a danger sign <b>since</b> <b>this</b> relapse can be bacterial pneumonia.|$|E
