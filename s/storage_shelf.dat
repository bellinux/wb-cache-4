5000|$|Tiny is Magee's {{assistant}} {{in the command}} center. He has his own short film on-line, [...] "Tiny's Big Adventure," [...] which takes place during the show. Tiny attempts to get Magee a new cup of cocoa, but misses the last cup and {{has to make a}} new one, something quite difficult since he cannot reach the <b>storage</b> <b>shelf.</b> So, he tries using a broom to reach the <b>storage</b> <b>shelf,</b> but it knocks down other cups. It also causes the can of Yuletide Gae to dump into the Coffee pot and the can to fall onto his head and he accidentally bumps into the dispenser of Fun Nog, causing it to fall on him, spilling it all over him. Then, the Coffee pot is done making the cocoa and he gets up, puts the cocoa in a cup and takes it to Magee. But when she drinks it, it tastes awful and she asks if he could try no Decaf and Tiny sighs. All that is shown of Tiny is the top of his hat, but, when Wayne threatens to expose Magee and Tiny's relationship, we see it point straight up with alarm.|$|E

50|$|For 2016, the Chevrolet Equinox {{received}} its first mid-cycle refresh {{along with its}} cousin the GMC Terrain, which was unveiled at the 2015 Chicago Auto Show on February 12, 2015. The refreshed Equinox received a new grille, headlights and front fascia as well as reworked tail lights. In the interior, the Equinox gained a new gear selector, a second <b>storage</b> <b>shelf</b> underneath the dashboard, as well as deletion of the door lock buttons from the dashboard. A new level trim, L, was introduced as the base level, as LS was made the second level, followed by LT and LTZ. Both LT1 and LT2 level trims were discontinued.More features are in LTZ and LS trims, while LT is unchanged from 2015. However, the OnStar delete feature was removed along with the discontinuation of five color palates, the CD/AM/FM/MP3/WMA Playback audio system, the rear seat entertainment system and one set of 19-inch chrome wheels. In its place are the Chevrolet MyLink system that became standard on all trims, four new color palates, and new 17- and 18-inch wheel trims.|$|E
5000|$|While Drs. Banner and Marks try {{to reverse}} the process, {{reporter}} Jack McGee of a tabloid called the National Register, who had been probing Banner's research into the limits of human strength, investigates the campers' sighting of the Hulk and intrudes on the lab. While the scientists plead ignorance, McGee suspects they know something and sneaks into the lab, hiding in a chemical storage room. Dr. Banner catches McGee hiding, and the startled reporter knocks a chemical off of a <b>storage</b> <b>shelf.</b> As Dr. Banner takes McGee outside, the spilled chemicals set off a fire. Dr. Banner rushes back into the lab to save Dr. Marks. Seeing Dr. Marks injured and in grave danger triggers another transformation into the Hulk.

40|$|Sweet sorghum is {{an ideal}} {{feedstock}} for ethanol production, {{in view of the}} increased global demand for biofuels. Sweet sorghum juice is a perishable commodity and the stalk juice has a short shelf life (4 – 5 h) post-crushing due to its high fermentable sugar content and the rapid sugar degradation during storage is due to the metabolic activities of contaminating spoilage bacteria. Hence, the preservation of the juice is required for quality retention and to extend the <b>storage</b> <b>shelf</b> life of the juice. In the present study, the effect of chemical preservatives to extend the storage stability of sweet sorghum juice and its later bioconversion to ethanol was studied. Among the chemical preservatives evaluated, the juice samples spiked with sodium benzoate and sorbic acid delayed the increase in reducing sugars and thus prevented browning of juice during storage. Sodium benzoate and sorbic acid-spiked samples showed a decrease in the total sugar content from 13. 03 to 10. 7 % and 11. 35 to 10. 16 %, respectively, over a storage period of 96 h. Ethanol yield was in the range of 0. 425 – 0. 475 g g− 1 and 0. 405 – 0. 445 g g− 1 with optimal efficiency of 93 and 92 % for sodium benzoate and sorbic acid, respectively, while the control showed a reduction in yield from 0. 36 to 0. 26 g g− 1 and efficiency by 57 %. Sodium benzoate (at 1, 000 ppm concentration) was identified as suitable preservative to retain the quality and extend the <b>storage</b> <b>shelf</b> life of fresh sweet sorghum juice up to 2 days at 37 °C...|$|E

40|$|Throughout history, {{objects of}} art {{have been damaged}} and {{sometimes}} destroyed in earthquakes. Even though the importance of providing seismically adequate design for nonstructural components has received attention over the past decade, art objects in museums, either on display or in storage, require further research. The research reported {{in this study was}} undertaken to investigate the seismic vulnerability of art objects. Data for this research was gathered from three museums in Montreal. The seismic behaviour of three unrestrained display cases, <b>storage</b> <b>shelves,</b> and a 6 m long dinosaur skeleton model structure was investigated according to the seismic hazard for Montreal and representative museum floor motions were simulated for that purpose. Particular attention was paid to the support conditions, the effects of modified floor surface conditions, the sliding and rocking response of unrestrained display cases, the location (floor elevation) of the display case and/or <b>storage</b> <b>shelves,</b> art object mass, and the dynamic properties of the display cases/storage shelves. The seismic vulnerability of art objects was evaluated based on the seismic response of the display cases/storage shelves at the level of art object display. The display cases were investigated experimentally using shake table testing. Computer analyses were used to simulate the seismic behaviour of <b>storage</b> <b>shelves,</b> and the seismic sensitivity of the dinosaur structure was determined via free vibration acceleration measurements. The floor contact conditions and floor elevation had a crucial effect on the unrestrained display cases, causing them to slide or rock vigorously. The distribution of content mass had a large impact on the response of the shelving system. As a result of experimental and analytical analyses, recommendations and/or simple mitigation techniques are provided to reduce the seismic vulnerability of objects of art...|$|R
40|$|An {{aluminum}} platform {{serves as}} a <b>storage</b> <b>shelf</b> for experiments transported on the space shuttle. This platform {{is attached to the}} shuttle storage area through several supports, each consisting of an attachment fitting, a monoball bearing, a clevis pin and a support strut. The experiments must be temperature controlled during and after launch. Consequently, heat loss through the plate, attachment fitting, monoball bearing, and strut are important. The overall conductance of the monoball bearing was determined by an experimental method of heating the outer ring with a nichrome resistance wire and cooling the inner ball with propylene glycol. Temperature differences across the bearing were measured for various heat fluxes. The overall conductance is 0. 42 Watts/C (0. 80 BTU/hr F), This yields a 16 watt loss for a 38 C temperature difference across the bearing...|$|E

40|$|Interest {{is growing}} daily on the {{utilization}} of bamboo as a reliable supplement to wood in furniture production to mitigate the scarcity of wood raw material supply. This study explored the viability of recycling bamboo recovered from scaffold into intermediate raw material for indoor furniture production. Strips were processed from the recovered Bambusa vulgaris Schrad and were subjected to conventional treatment methods with some modification to simplify the treatment. The durability of the treated strip was evaluated in accordance with ASTM D 2017. A <b>storage</b> <b>shelf</b> was designed and fabricated using laminates made from the bamboo strips. The diameter and wall thickness of the recovered bamboo culms ranges from 6. 00 cm- 10. 00 cm and 10. 00 mm- 12. 70 mm respectively.
