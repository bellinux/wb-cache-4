40|$|To {{investigate}} the adiabatic behaviour {{of a novel}} Reverse Flow Catalytic Membrane Reactor with perovskite membranes, detailed reactor simulations were performed with an experimentally determined O 2 permeation expression (Part 1). Simulation results obtained with the High Switching Frequency Model showed that when the activation energy was not accounted for in the O 2 permeation expression, <b>stationary</b> <b>reactor</b> operation with high syngas selectivities can be achieved. However, these simulations also revealed that the local production rate of reaction heat changes enormously along the membrane. This caused severe temperature excursions when the activation energy was accounted for, which would be detrimental for the chemical and mechanical stability of the perovskite membrane, and no stable reactor operation could be achieved. To avoid these problems, {{the use of a}} porous support on the air side of the membrane to limit the O 2 permeation flux was investigated. With HSFM simulations it was demonstrated that the local O 2 permeation flux can indeed be moderated and stationary axial temperature profiles could be obtained. To demonstrate that the RFCMR with perovskite membranes can also be operated dynamically and that high quality syngas can be produced in an energy efficient way, simulations with the Dynamic Model were performed. Indeed very high syngas selectivities could be achieved, higher than typically encountered in current industrial practice...|$|E

50|$|The {{site was}} the scene of the only fatal nuclear reactor {{incident}} in U.S. history on the night of January 3, 1961. The event occurred at an experimental U.S. Army reactor plant known as the Argonne Low Power Reactor, which the Army called the <b>Stationary</b> Low-Power <b>Reactor</b> Number One (SL-1) once built. Due to poor design and maintenance procedures, a single control rod was manually pulled out too far from the reactor, causing the reactor to become prompt critical, and leading to a destructive power excursion. Three military, trained men had been working inside the reactor room when a mistake was made while reattaching a control rod to its motor assembly. With the central control rod nearly fully extended, the nuclear reactor rated at 3 MW rapidly increased power to 20 GW; this rapidly boiled the water inside the core. As the steam expanded, a pressure wave of water forcefully struck the top of the reactor vessel upon which 2 of the men stood. The explosion was so severe that the reactor vessel was propelled 9 feet into the air, striking the ceiling before settling back into its original position. One man was killed instantly as he was impaled by a shield plug and lodged into the ceiling. The other men died from their injuries within hours. The three men were buried in lead coffins, and that entire section of the site was buried. The core meltdown caused no damage to the area, although some radioactive fission products were released to the atmosphere. While nuclear reactors like SL-1 were predicted to have lower total costs than conventional systems, the Army program to build and use reactors of this kind was scrapped due to the higher initial procurement costs of nuclear reactors.|$|R

In electrochemical membrane reactors (EMR), this is realized by feeding the oxygen across a dense ion conducting membrane to the adjacent porous catalytic layer.

40|$|A {{rigorous}} {{kinetic model}} of hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of complex mixtures such as light cycle oil (LCO) or diesel has been developed. An experimental setup was constructed {{to investigate the}} hydrotreatment of complex mixtures. The hydrodesulfurization of LCO on a commercial CoMo/Al 2 O 3 (IMP) catalyst was investigated in a Robinson Mahoney perfectly mixed flow <b>stationary</b> basket <b>reactor.</b> An experimental investigation of the HDS of the dibenzothiophene (DBT) and substituted dibenzothiophenes in the LCO was carried out at temperatures between 290 and 330 ?C, space time for dibenzothiophene (W/F 0 DBT) between 1000 and 6500 kgcat-h/kmol, and H 2 /HC molar ratio constant of 2. 8. To avoid {{having to deal with}} a huge number of parameters in the model, a methodology based on structural contributions was applied. DENs and DENt are the denominators of the Hougen-Watson rate expressions for hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT) and methyl-substituted dibenzothiophenes contained in the LCO. Both denominators comprise the concentration of all adsorbing species of the LCO multiplied by their adsorption equilibrium constants. The estimation of the denominators DENs and DENt was performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the results in terms of conversion for DBT, biphenyl and cyclohexylbenzene obtained in the hydrodesulfurization of the LCO. The evolution of DENs and DENt values with the composition was calculated for each LCO experiment. Structural contributions were taken from Vanrysselberghe and Froment for hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation of methyl-substituted dibenzothiophenes with a significant {{reduction in the number of}} parameters to be estimated in the HDS of the LCO. The multiplication factors, fsDBT, which are products of structural contributions for hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation of the mono- and dimethyl-dibenzothiophenes were also taken from Vanrysselberghe and Froment. These multiplication factors are based on experimental results with model components such as DBT, 4 -Methyl dibenzothiophene and 4, 6 -Dimethyl dibenzothiophene. The results obtained in the modeling are in good agreement with the experimental data because the model reproduces very well the observed total conversions of DBT, conversions of DBT into biphenyl and conversions of DBT into cyclohexylbenzene as a function of temperature...|$|R

Hydrogenation reactions were conducted at a reaction pressure of 364. 7 psia, at three different reaction temperatures: 85 ?C, 97 ?C and 110 ?C, at five different residence times: 0. 6 (only at 110 ?C), 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 3. 1 hr, with the hydrogen to the aromatic sulfonyl chloride molar ratio: 8. 0 mol/mol and hydrogen to argon molar ratio: 3. 0 mol/mol. Intrinsic reaction rates of the reacting species were obtained {{on the surface of}} a commercial 1 wt% palladium on charcoal catalyst. The conversion and molar yield profiles of the reacting species with respect to process time suggest a deactivation of the 1 wt % palladium on charcoal catalyst. Kinetic data collected in a continuous process mode show that the catalyst is deactivated during an experiment when the process time equal to two to three times the residence time of the liquid within the reactor. XRD analysis shows that the active sites are blocked and an amorphous layer was formed {{on the surface of the}} palladium catalyst. Semi-Batch mode experimental data were obtained at 110 ?C after 8 hours of reaction time for several aromatic sulfonyl chlorides. A kinetic model has been developed, which includes adsorption of individual components and surface reactions as well as rate equations of the Hougen-Watson type. A hyperbolic deactivation function expressed in term of process time is implemented in the Hougen-Watson equation rates. The mathematical model consists of non-linear and simultaneous differential equations with multiple variables.

40|$|Several {{options for}} {{designing}} fast reactors {{to operate in}} the Breed-and-Burn (B&B) mode are compared and a strategy is outlined for early introduction of B&B reactors followed by a gradual increase in the fuel utilization of such reactors. In the first phase the fast reactor core will consist of a subcritical B&B blanket driven by a relatively small critical seed. As the required discharge burnup/radiation-damage to both driver and blanket fuel had already been proven, and as the depleted uranium fueled B&B blanket could generate close to 2 / 3 of the core power and will have very low fuel cycle cost, the deployment of such fast reactors could start in the near future. The second phase consists of deploying self-sustaining <b>stationary</b> wave B&B <b>reactors.</b> It will require development of fuel technology that could withstand peak burnups of ~ 30 % and peak radiation damage to the cladding of ~ 550 dpa. The third phase requires development of a fuel reconditioning technology that will enable using the fuel up to an average burnup of ~ 50 %—the upper bound permitted by neutron balance considerations when most of the fission products are not separated from the fuel. The increase in the uranium ore utilization relative to that provided by contemporary power reactors is estimated to be 20, 40 and 100 folds for, respectively, phase 1, 2 and 3. The energy value of the depleted uranium stockpiles (“waste”) accumulated in the US is equivalent to, when used in the B&B reactors, up to 20 centuries of the total 2010 USA supply of electricity.

40|$|Scale-up of chromatographic {{columns and}} {{reactors}} processing liquid phases is typically based on increasing the column diameter {{while maintaining the}} linear flow velocity constant. Chemical engineers’ long experience with conventional steady state fixed-bed reactor operation tells that such a scale-up strategy can, in case of exothermic reactions, lead to formation of hot spots. In addition, periodic operation of non-isothermal gas phase adsorptive reactors has been investigated in detail. It is therefore rather surprising that the thermal behaviour of periodically operated liquid phase chromatographic reactors has received only little attention in the literature [1 – 3]. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate under which conditions can nonisothermal operation of single column (batch) and simulated moving-bed (continuous) chromatographic reactors be advantageous or disadvantageous. A theoretical analysis was carried out by using the equilibrium theory and numerical simulations, and an experimental study by using laboratory scale reactors. Thermal effects in a liquid phase chromatographic reactor originate from reaction enthalpy, adsorption enthalpy, and enthalpy of mixing the liquids. Under nonisothermal conditions, the propagation velocities of concentration fronts can differ significantly of those under isothermal conditions because concentration and thermal waves (and shocks) are coupled through the enthalpy of adsorption. Therefore, the liquid phase to solid phase heat capacity ratio becomes an important factor. Esterifications of acetic acid with methanol and ethanol to produce methyl acetate and ethyl acetate were used as the model reactions. Amberlyst 15 (20 wt-% crosslink density) and Finex CS 16 G (8 wt-% cross-link density) ion-exchange resins in H + form were chosen as the <b>stationary</b> phases. <b>Reactor</b> experiments were carried out in thermally insulated (adiabatic) columns of 1. 6 and 2. 6 cm in diameter and 20 to 50 cm in height, fitted with 5 to 8 thermocouples along the main axis of the column. Experiments under temperature controlled (isothermal) conditions were carried out as a reference. As an example of the results, the development of a positive thermal wave in the column (higher temperature than in the feed) was recorded in the front of a wide pulse injection. The thermal wave had a self-amplifying nature because the moving reaction front travels at approximately the same velocity. Thermal effects in chromatographic reactors can therefore be much more pronounced than in conventional fixed-bed reactors. Using the Finex resin, for example, the observed maximum temperature increase in the thermal wave was approximately 25 K under conditions where the temperature rise in a conventional fixed-bed reactor operated at steady state was only 6 K.

40|$|Pyrolysis {{of biomass}} {{consists}} of heating solid biomass inthe absence of air to produce solid, liquid and gaseous fuels. In {{the first part}} of this thesis rapid pyrolysis of wood(birch) and some agricultural residues (olive waste, sugarcanebagasse and wheat straw in untreated and in pelletized form) athigh temperature (800 ºC 9 ̆ 61000 ºC) is studied ina free fall reactor at pilot scale. These conditions are ofinterest for gasification in fluidized beds. Of main interestare the gas and char yields and compositions as well as thereactivity of the produced char in gasification. A higher temperature and smaller particles increase theheating rate resulting in a decreased char yield. The crackingof the hydrocarbons with an increase of the hydrogen content inthe gaseous product is favoured by a higher temperature and byusing smaller particles. Wood gives more volatiles and lesschar than straw and olive waste. The higher ash content inagricultural residues favours the charring reactions. Charsfrom olive waste and straw are more reactive in gasificationthan chars from birch because of the higher ash content. Thecomposition of the biomass influences the product distribution. Birch and bagasse give more volatiles and less char thanquebracho, straw and olive waste. Longer residence time inrapid pyrolysis increase the time for contact between tar andchar which makes the char less reactive. The secondary charproduced from tar not only covers the primary char but alsoprobably encapsulates the ash and hinders the catalytic effectof the ash. High char reactivity is favoured by conditionswherethe volatiles are rapidly removed from the particle, i. e. high heating rate, high temperature and small particles. The second part of this thesis deals with slow pyrolysis inpresence of steam for preparation of active carbon. Theinfluence of the type of biomass, the type of reactor and thetreatment conditions, mainly temperature and activation time,on the properties and the yield of active carbons are studied. The precursors used in the experiments are birch (wood) anddifferent types of agricultural residues such as sugarcanebagasse, olive waste, miscanthus pellets and straw in untreatedand pelletized form. The results from the pyrolysis of biomass in presence ofsteam are compared with those obtained in inert atmosphere ofnitrogen. The steam contributes to the formation of solidresidues with high surface area and good adsorption capacity. The yield of liquid products increases significantly at theexpense of the gaseous and solid products. Large amount ofsteam result in liquid products consisting predominantly ofwater-soluble polar compounds. In comparison to the <b>stationary</b> fixed bed <b>reactor,</b> therotary reactor increases the production of energy-rich gases atthe expense of liquid products. The raw materials have strong effect on the yields and theproperties of the pyrolysis products. At equal time oftreatment an increase of the temperature results in a decreaseof the yield of solid residue and improvement of the adsorptioncapacity until the highest surface area is reached. Furtherincrease of the temperature decreases the yield of solidproduct without any improvement in the adsorption capacity. Therate of steam flow influences the product distribution. Theyield of liquid products increases while the gas yielddecreases when the steam flow is increased.
