5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called <b>stiffeners.</b> Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E

The effectiveness of these concepts was evaluated using panels with 16 -ply skins and a single centrally-located I-shaped <b>stiffener</b> with both static and cyclic compressive loadings. Analytical results suggest that tailoring the relative thicknesses of the panel skin, <b>stiffener</b> attachment flange, and the <b>stiffener</b> web rotational stiffness can minimize the adverse effects of high interface shear and normal stresses.

40|$|Cylindrical shells such as {{aboveground}} steel {{storage tanks}} {{are widely used}} to store gases, chemicals and fuels. <b>Stiffener</b> rings are introduced to prevent cylindrical shells from buckling due to wind loads. The current top wind <b>stiffener</b> design rules used in the USA for such cylindrical storage tanks are specified in API 650. However, the design methodology of top <b>stiffener</b> rings is overly conservative. Therefore, relaxation of the design rules for the top <b>stiffener</b> is investigated in this study. The API 650 mandated top <b>stiffener</b> size was reduced to {{the same size as}} the mandated intermediate <b>stiffener</b> ring in this study. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to perform simulations for different tank models to obtain buckling loads. Geometrically nonlinear analysis including imperfections (GNIA) was also introduced to imitate realistic behaviors. The buckling loads were found to be larger than the required design pressure.

Ultrasonic lamb waves are transmitted through <b>stiffener</b> using the sensoractuator network for detecting the presence of damages. The sensor-actuator network is placed on both halves of the stiffened section on the accessible surface of the plate. Detecting damage in <b>stiffener</b> by using this technique has significant potential for SHM technology.

25|$|Mausoleums {{were rarely}} built as {{free-standing}} structures after the 14th century, being instead often attached to madrasas in pairs. Domes of these madrasas, {{such as those}} of the madrasa of Goharshad (1417–1433) and the madrasa at Ḵargerd (1436–1443), had dramatically innovative interiors. They used intersecting arches to support an inner dome narrower than the floor below, a change that may have originated with the 14th century use of small lantern domes over transverse vaulting. The madrasa of Goharshad is also the first triple-shell dome. The middle dome may have been added as reinforcement. Triple-shelled domes are rare outside of the Timurid era. The dome of the Amir Chakhmaq mosque (1437) has a semi-circular inner shell and an advanced system of <b>stiffeners</b> and wooden struts supporting a shallow pointed outer shell. Notably, the dome has a circular drum with two tiers. Another double shell dome from the early Seljuq period at the shrine complex of Bayazid Bastami was changed in the Timurid period by the addition of a third conical shell over the existing two domed shells.|$|E
500|$|From {{about the}} 4th century BCE, {{the use of}} {{stiffened}} ends on composite bows became widespread.

Siyahs have also been described from the Arabian peninsula. Composite bows were adopted by the Roman Empire and were made even in the cold and damp of Britannia.

Analysis was carried out using non-linear finite element method using MSC/NASTRAN software. Link was modeled as CQUAD shell element. Along the boundary of the loading area the nodal are constraint to produce only one direction loading. The length of the link in this analysis is 400 mm of the steel profile of WF 200. 100.

The failure mechanism is very similar at the three temperatures tested: - 55 C, Room Temperature and + 100 C. The damage initiates at the central noodle of the composite <b>stiffener.</b> Unstable delamination then propagates from the noodle to the tip of the <b>stiffener</b> foot, preferably through the <b>stiffener</b> foot plies.
