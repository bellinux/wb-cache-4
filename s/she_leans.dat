5|$|In Season 4, Kurt joins Rachel in New York {{after she}} reveals {{that she is}} unhappy with her roommate and life at that point. After the {{encouragement}} of Blaine and his father, he decides to sell his car and fly to New York, where he finds a loft in Bushwick for him and Rachel to move into. Kurt applies for a job at Vogue.com and his editor, Isabelle Wright, who is also from Ohio, hires him partially based upon his portfolio of outfits and is impressed with his intuition and style. Early on, <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> on his support, and then quickly returns his support when he decides to give Rachel a makeover in the Vogue closet. Instead of being angry, she loves his idea to do a musical makeover for the website and joins in the makeover. Kurt becomes increasingly busy with his job at Vogue, and Blaine cheats on him in Lima. He comes to New York to tell Kurt what happened, and they break up.|$|E
500|$|In the {{painting}} Virgin and Child with St. Anne the composition again {{picks up the}} theme of figures in a landscape, which Wasserman describes as [...] "breathtakingly beautiful" [...] and harkens back to the St Jerome picture with the figure set at an oblique angle. What makes this painting unusual {{is that there are}} two obliquely set figures superimposed. Mary is seated on the knee of her mother, St Anne. <b>She</b> <b>leans</b> forward to restrain the Christ Child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice. This painting, which was copied many times, influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, and Andrea del Sarto, and through them Pontormo and Correggio. The trends in composition were adopted in particular by the Venetian painters Tintoretto and Veronese.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} scene Agnes {{has been moved}} by the Prefect's grief, and prayed for the son to be restored to life, which an angel has done. The repentant Procopius kneels before her, while <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> down to tell him Vade amplius noli peccare ("Go forth and sin no more"; from [...] ). However {{the result of the}} miracle was that (in William Caxton's translation) [...] "the bishops of the idols made a great discord among the people, so that all they cried: Take away this sorceress and witch that turned men's minds and alieneth their wits". The Prefect is now sympathetic to Agnes but fears he will lose his position if he does nothing, so leaves the matter in the hands of another official; the two are seen talking together, with words from [...] Nihil invenio cause in eam ("I find no cause against her") above. The last scene shows her martyrdom; she was sentenced to be burned but the flames part away from her so that finally the magistrate orders her killed by a spear. Her last words, from , are In manus tuas domine commendo animam meam ("Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit").|$|E

500|$|The {{cover sleeve}} and images were shot by Ellen von Unwerth. The cover was {{released}} by Jive Records on October 12, 2007. It features Spears sporting black hair and wearing a pink (blue in the rear cover) dress, and a white fedora. A reviewer for the Ottawa Citizen felt the design was [...] "horrendous". The centerfold pictures feature Spears and a priest in suggestive poses in a confessional. The first image shows Spears, who wears a cross and fishnet stockings, sitting on the priest's lap, while in the second one <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> suggestively against the confessional with the priest sitting {{on the other side}} of the partition. After the album was released, the Catholic League's director of communications Kiera McCaffrey stated that the group considered the photos a [...] "cheap publicity stunt" [...] to promote the album and condemned Spears for [...] "mocking a Catholic sacrament". McCaffrey added: [...] "All we see is how troubled this girl is now, especially with her family, losing her kids, with her career on a downward slide. And now she's put out this album and this is her tactic to promote it?" [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV said that the images were reminiscent of Madonna's music video for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] (1989). The booklet also contains pictures of empty chairs with ripped tabloid pages and still images from the music video for [...] "Gimme More". The album doesn't include a thank-you list, unlike her previous albums.|$|E
500|$|Jack {{questions}} Owen about Gwen and Rhys, and {{he states}} that Rhys' mother Brenda (Nerys Hughes) is with them. Tosh mentions that she saw Brenda with Gwen's mother Mary in the garden. Tosh and Jack rush to the couple's room, where Jack identifies Brenda as an alien and calls her an [...] "ugly bitch". After Brenda protests her innocence and Rhys punches Jack, Gwen states that Rhys' mother is not the shapeshifter as Brenda wears a distinctive perfume. Torchwood reach the garden to find the Nostrovite, in Brenda's image, with Mary. The alien holds Mary hostage, demanding that Gwen give her her child. Gwen walks towards them and as the Nostrovite releases Mary, Gwen reveals a hidden gun in her wedding bouquet and fires at the creature. Owen suggests using a piece of alien equipment called the singularity scalpel to destroy the alien fetus. He sends Gwen {{to her room and}} teaches Rhys how to use the scalpel; Owen cannot use it himself due to injuries sustained in his undead state. Gwen is approached by Jack and reveals to him that she would have married Rhys a long time ago if she had not met him. <b>She</b> <b>leans</b> in as he appears to be ready to kiss her but he reveals himself to be the Nostrovite. Owen enters, shooting the creature whilst Gwen exits with Rhys. The Nostrovite, still in Jack's form, attempts to attack Owen only to be repelled by the fact he is dead.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy. In regards to the video's concept, Swift stated, [...] "It deals with the haunting power of music and how hearing a song {{years after it was}} first popular can have such an emotional appeal." [...] Clayton Collins portrayed Swift's love interest in the music video. He was cast because of his physical resemblance to the real subject of the song, in that they were both tall with dark hair. The video begins with Swift, dressed by a white sundress, as she lies on the grass of a lake-bed and holds a transistor radio. Suddenly, the setting is switched to Collins as he drives a white and orange 1970 Chevrolet CST-10. He then turns his radio on and ceases driving, coming to a complete stop on a road. As Collins facial expressions become more serious, he flashbacks to memories with Swift. Swift and Collins are seen frolicking in a field, lying beside another on the back of Collins' CST-10, staring at the stars together, holding hands as they walk, and slow dancing. When the song is in its final chorus, Collins arrives at a wooden cabin in his pick-up truck. He runs up the staircase to discover an enveloped letter next to the door. He then sits on the staircase, opens the envelope, and reads the letter. The video transcends towards Swift playing an acoustic guitar as <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> against the wooden cabin. Cut-scenes feature Swift lying on the lake-bed and performing with a guitar next to the wooden cabin. The video concludes with Swift, once again, lying on the initial setting.|$|E

500|$|As {{she leaves}} the mansion, she exits into [...] "Emancipation Street", a ghetto looking plaza made up entirely of props and hand made stores. With shops named [...] "So So Fetch" [...] and [...] "Pink Yet Lavender", Carey then walks up to a wall, where she passes Jermaine Dupri, who makes a cameo appearance. As <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> on the wall, her coat slips off, and two schoolgirls do a shake dance at the pay phones. Carey then appears in a Lamborghini Murcielago {{speaking}} on her PDA with Chris Tucker, who as a cameo, appeared {{on the set of}} the video shoot, as the man in the passenger's seat. As Carey leaves her lover a second message, he is seen frolicking pool-side with two other women, while she says [...] "with this one and that one / By the pool, on the beach, in the streets." [...] Her phone breaks up as she drives past the [...] "Hollyhood" [...] sign, so she tells him, [...] "Hold on," [...] singing, [...] "Save this recording, because I'm never coming back home." [...] Carey is then shown on bleachers at a high school football game, with Da Brat featured as a cameo act, as she argues with a man in the background. She writes 'MIMI' on one of the bleachers and the letters transform into a large shiny [...] "MIMI" [...] sign made of lights, which appear in large, vibrant lights. Carey walks up to a microphone in front of the large 'MIMI' lights, and dances and sings in front of the camera, wearing a revealing black ensemble and leopard print boots. In the final scene, Carey is seen on a beach, as she slips out of her robe and walks into the sunset, with the glare obscuring whether she's wearing any clothing.|$|E
2500|$|... 20. Finale. The {{final section}} {{begins with a}} soft woodwind chord {{followed}} by harp arpeggios with a wordless choral accompaniment à bouches fermées (similar to the [...] "Humming Chorus" [...] from Puccini's later opera, Madama Butterfly) which repeats the theme from Pâle et blonde. Ophélie sings: Le voilà! Je crois l'entendre! – [...] "There he is! I think I hear him!". As <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> over the water, holding onto {{the branches of a}} willow [...] with one hand, and brushing aside the rushes with the other, she repeats some of the words and the melody (Theme of Hamlet's Love) from her love duet with Hamlet in act 1 (Ophélie: Doute de la lumière – [...] "Doubt that the light illumines"). One sees her momentarily floating in her white gown, as the current carries her away. (The action follows Gertrude's description of Ophelia's death in Shakespeare's act 4, scene 7.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Flutes (Captivity): The stage {{returns to}} the Archer's Den, where the Twin Brother is imprisoned in a small cage. The Chief Archer's Daughter watches from a distance, holding the flutes that the twins played before their lives were changed forever. All seems lost for the Twin Brother until he finds {{a friend in the}} kind-natured Chief Archer's Daughter, who dares to {{approach}} him. She passes the flutes to the Twin Brother, he begins to play and when <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> towards the cage for a closer look at him, he leans forward to steal a brief kiss. Although the Chief Archer's Daughter is taken aback, as she turns away from the Twin Brother it is obvious that she has also become smitten by him. After their tender moment and after great hesitation, the Chief Archer's Daughter sets the Twin Brother free from his cage, begging him to flee. Before he does, the Twin Brother makes a decision [...] he returns to her his flutes, the precious ceremonial gifts that were treasured by their kingdom. The Twin Brother then escapes, leaving the Chief Archer's Daughter in hope they will meet again. She cannot hide her joy [...] she expresses her love through a touching performance of dance using the twins' flutes. All of this is secretly witnessed by the Counselor's Son, who has desired the Chief Archer's Daughter for years. Engulfed by rage and jelousy of his unrequited love, he prepares for war.|$|E
