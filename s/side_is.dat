50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1902 on {{reclaimed}} land near {{the western end}} of Southampton Railway Tunnel.

5|$|The {{tower is}} {{in three stages}} and is {{supported}} by buttresses. In the lowest stage, on the west <b>side,</b> <b>is</b> a doorway in Romanesque style, on the north <b>side</b> <b>is</b> an ogee-headed lancet window. On {{the left of the}} east <b>side</b> <b>is</b> a Perpendicular-style porch. The middle stage has a two-light window on the west side, above which is a circular clock face, and on the north and east sides are lancet windows. The top stage contains a two-light louvred bell opening on each side. The parapet is plain, and projecting from it on the west <b>side</b> <b>is</b> a gargoyle. The spire is octagonal, with two tiers of lucarnes (dormer windows). The north side of the church is divided by buttresses into four bays. The second bay from the east contains a priest's door, above which is a lancet window. To the right of the door is a small trefoil-headed window. The other bays contain two-light windows with Early English tracery. Battlemented parapets run around the walls of the aisle walls and the clerestory. The clerestory has seven bays on either side, each containing a four-light Perpendicular window. At the east end are three windows. The central window, {{at the end of the}} chancel, is Perpendicular with seven lights. This is flanked by two aisle windows with plate tracery, the one to the right having four lights, and that to the left five lights.|$|E

5|$|A highsider, highside, or high <b>side</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} bike motion {{which is}} caused by a rear wheel gaining {{traction}} when it is not facing in the direction of travel, usually after slipping sideways in a curve.

It can {{take the form of a}} single slip-then-flip or a series of violent oscillations.|$|E

5|$|Another legend {{from the}} Linga Purana {{says that the}} {{embracing}} of love-struck Shiva and Mohini led to be their merging into one body. At this moment, Mohini became Vishnu again, resulting the composite deity Harihara, whose {{right side of the}} body is Shiva and left <b>side</b> <b>is</b> Vishnu in his male form. In the temple in Sankarnayinarkovil near Kalugumalai is one of the rarest exceptions to iconography of Harihara (Sankara-Narayana). The deity is depicted similar to the Ardhanari, the composite form of Shiva-Parvati, where right side of the body is the male Shiva and left <b>side</b> <b>is</b> female. This image's female side represents Mohini and it, as a whole, symbolizes the union of Shiva and Mohini. The influence of Shakta traditions on Shaiva ones may have {{led to the development of}} composite images like Harihara, where Vishnu is identified with Shiva's consort, or Mohini. Like the Kanda Puranam narrative, the Shaiva saint Appar identifies Vishnu as Parvati (Uma), the female counterpart of Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Aylmer Road is a {{very short}} stretch of road, running west for {{less than half a}} mile between the {{junction}} with the A1000 in Haringey to the junction with The Bishops Avenue in Barnet. The entire southern side of the road is taken up by Highgate Golf Course, while the northern <b>side</b> <b>is</b> a mixture of small shops, flats and allotments. The road is named for General Sir Fenton John Aylmer, VC KCB, who received the Victoria Cross for his part in the assault on Nilt Fort on 2 December 1891.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with County Donegal, Lough Swilly {{separates}} {{one side}} of the Inishowen peninsula. Lough Foyle on the other <b>side,</b> <b>is</b> one of Ireland's larger inlets, situated between County Donegal and County Londonderry.

5000|$|The Kepler {{triangle}} is a {{right triangle}} whose <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> in a geometric progression. If the <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> formed from the geometric progression a, ar, ar2 then its common ratio r is given by r = [...] where φ is the golden ratio. Its <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> therefore in the ratio 1 : [...] : φ. Thus, {{the shape of the}} Kepler triangle is uniquely determined (up to a scale factor) by the requirement that its <b>sides</b> <b>be</b> in a geometric progression.|$|R

5|$|Brean Down is a {{site for}} the nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum apenninum), which occurs in {{abundance}} on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing near Bridgwater Bay, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae) Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern <b>side</b> <b>is</b> dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E
