The goal of this research study was to do an explorative study in order to establish the experiences of patients with regard to social and health <b>services</b> <b>factors</b> that contribute to delays in seeking treatment for Tuberculosis. The objectives to meet the goal were an exploration and description of patients’ experiences with regards to social and health <b>service</b> <b>factors</b> contributing to delays in seeking treatment for Tuberculosis. Another goal was to make recommendations on social and health <b>service</b> <b>factors</b> that contribute to patients’ delays in seeking treatment based on the findings. The research study had been of a qualitative nature exploring patients’ experiences of social and health <b>services</b> <b>factors</b> that contribute to delays in seeking treatment for Tuberculosis. Qualitative research was used in this study using semi-structured interviews with an interview guide. Data analysis was done according to the eight steps as recorded in Tesch in Creswell (1994 : 155). The findings of this research were or include social factors contributing to patients’ delays in seeking treatment for TB. There were four categories related to social factors namely socio-economic, substance abuse, psycho-social and interpersonal relations factors. The findings also indicated that there were health <b>service</b> <b>factors</b> contributing to patients’ delay in seeking treatment for TB. These include quality of health care services, attitudes of medical staff and other medical conditions treatment. It was concluded that social and health services, as mentioned indeed contribute to patients’ delays in seeking treatment for Tuberculosis. Recommendations for practice included better case detection, treatment and health education. In order to address the various social factors as described above it is necessary to treat TB holistically and include a social worker as part of the multidisciplinary team. South Afric...|$|R

The years after independence, the size of Real GDP, Per Capita GDP and their growth rates was small but improved from 1990. In this study the GDP of the 64 districts in Pakistan at current market prices are considered. The factors which have effects on the gross district product in the year 2010 - 2011 are measured here. Here Principal Component analysis and Maximum Likelihood method of factor analysis are used for the seventeen variables of the gross district products of 64 districts. The results show that seventeen variables contributing to our GDP have been classified into three factors. Then we rename these three factors from principal component analysis as <b>service</b> <b>factor,</b> agriculture & infrastructure factor, and fishing & mining factor. In maximum likelihood method we rename the factors as <b>service</b> <b>factor,</b> agriculture & infrastructure factor, and education factor.

The study aim to investigate if there are any connections between customer behavior variables such as gender, age and income in comparison to these <b>service</b> quality <b>factors</b> related to pension products. The findings aim to help a small financial institute such as our case company Plain Capital to understand how their customers experience service quality regarding pension products. In order to find empirical results we conducted a qualitative research as well a quantitative research. The qualitative research employed both a focus group interview with pension savers and an interview with our case company Plain Capital. We were able to identify the <b>service</b> quality <b>factors</b> for pension’s products with help from the focus group interview. The quantitative research employed a visited survey, which measure connections between customer behavior variables such as gender, age and income in comparison to these <b>service</b> quality <b>factors</b> related to pension products. The qualitative endings show that the service quality experience regarding pension products is based on eight <b>service</b> quality <b>factors.</b> The eight <b>service</b> quality <b>factors</b> identified in this study are physical environment, Webb environment, phone environment, financial performance, pension advising, level of individualization, characteristics of financial advisors and level of feedback. The quantitative findings show that characteristics of financial advisors are the one with the highest average out of the eight <b>service</b> quality <b>factors,</b> followed by level of individualization and Webb environment. The hypotheses tests show that there are four significant connections between the eight <b>service</b> quality <b>factors</b> and consumer behavior variables.

40|$|A systems {{engineering}} based methodology for exploring technical sustainability {{in the social}} and environmental context was used to investigate a specific transportation load in the city of Christchurch. The process includes defining sustainability performance parameters in engineering terms, defining service objectives in socio-economic terms, and then generating concept designs using standard engineering modeling. The approach reflects a balance between form and function, and we refer to the resulting concepts as energy architecture. In this study, the performance-objective methodology was used to develop the energy architecture for a wind and solar powered public transportation service that provides a 35 km circuit of schools, shopping malls, and industrial parks. The service objective for the design was set by an existing bus service. A number of concepts were explored for the renewable energy supply of an electric light rail trolley circuit on a dedicated (not grid connected) electric supply network. Each concept represents a different degree of capital investment and system complexity, and achieves a certain level of the desired transportation service on any given day. Real-time simulated performance modeled with historical local weather data was used to compare the performance of each of the possible architectures to the objective. A <b>service</b> <b>factor</b> was calculated to evaluate the level of transport service performance compared to the objective. The results demonstrate that no amount of investment in wind and solar energy capacity can provide the same service as the fossil fuel system. When pumped-hydro storage of wind and solar energy was added to the system, the <b>service</b> <b>factor</b> could be increased to 100 %. The modeling exercise points out that a relatively modest investment in wind generation can produce a useful service. However, the schedule would need to be flexible to match the wind energy availability.
