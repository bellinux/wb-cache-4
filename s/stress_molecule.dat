In human {{vascular}} tissues, {{we have found}} enhanced RA 301 /Tra 2 β expression in coronary artery with intimal thickening, and atherosclerotic aorta. Balloon injury to the rat carotid artery induced RA 301 /Tra 2 β transcripts followed by expression of the antigen, which was detected in medial and neointimal vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). In cultured VSMCs, hypoxia/re-oxygenation caused induction of RA 301 /Tra 2 β and was accompanied by cell proliferation, {{both of which were}} blocked by the addition of either diphenyl iodonium, a NADPH oxidase inhibitor, PD 98059, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, or antisense oligonucleotide for RA 301 /Tra 2 β. Consistent with a link between RA 301 /Tra 2 β and cell proliferation, platelet-derived growth factor also induced expression of RA 301 /Tra 2 β in cultured VSMCs. These data suggest a possible role for RA 301 /Tra 2 β in the regulation of VSMC proliferation, especially in the setting of hypoxia/re-oxygenation-induced cell stress...|$|E
40|$|The {{disaccharide}} trehalose {{is considered}} as a universal <b>stress</b> <b>molecule,</b> protecting cells and biomolecules from injuries imposed by high osmolarity, heat, oxidation, desiccation and freezing. Chromohalobacter salexigens is a halophilic and extremely halotolerant c-proteobacterium of the family Halomonadaceae. In this work, we have investigated the role of trehalose as a protectant against salinity, temperature and desiccation in C. salexigens. A mutant deficient in the trehalose- 6 -phosphate synthase gene (otsA::V) was not affected in its salt or heat tolerance, but double mutants ectoine- and trehalose-deficient, or hydroxyectoine-reduced and trehalose-deficient, displayed an osmo- and thermosensitive phenotype, respectively. This suggests a role of trehalose as a secondary solute involved in osmo- (at least at low salinity) and thermoprotection of C. salexigens. Interestingly, trehalose synthesis was osmoregulated at the transcriptional level, and thermoregulated at the post-transcriptional level, suggesting that C. salexigens cells need to be pre-conditioned by osmotic stress, {{in order to be}} able to quickly synthesize trehalose in response to heat stress. C. salexigens was more sensitive to desiccation than E. coli and desiccation tolerance was slightly improved when cells were grown at high temperature. Under these conditions, single mutants affected in the synthesis of trehalose or hydroxyectoine were more sensitive to desiccation than the wild-type strain. However, given the low survival rates of the wild type, the involvement of trehalose an...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Cancer {{cells are}} known to secrete the <b>stress</b> <b>molecules</b> MICA and MICB that {{activate}} cytotoxicity by lymphocytes and NK cells through their NKG 2 D receptor as a mechanism of immunological defense. This work was undertaken to evaluate if cancer cells can also express this receptor as a possible mechanisms of depletion of MIC molecules and thus interfere with their immune recognition. Methods Myelomonocytic leukemic (TPH- 1 and U- 937) and cervical cancer (CALO and INBL) cell lines were evaluated by Western Blot, ELISA, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry to evaluate their capacity to express and secrete MICA and MICB and to be induced to proliferate by these molecules {{as well as to}} express their receptor NKG 2 D. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA for time course analysis and Student's t-test for comparison between groups. Values were considered significantly different if p Results THP- 1 and U- 937 produce and secrete the stress MICA and MICB as shown by Western Blot of lysed cells and by ELISA of their conditioned media. By Western Blot and flow cytometry we found that these cells also express the receptor NKG 2 D. When THP- 1 and U- 937 were cultured with recombinant MICA and MICB they exhibited a dose dependent induction for their proliferation. CALO and INBL also produce MICA and MICB and were induced to proliferate by these <b>stress</b> <b>molecules.</b> By Western Blot, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry we also found that these cells express NKG 2 D. Conclusions Our novel results that tumor cells can simultaneously secrete MIC molecules and express their receptor, and to be induced for proliferation by these <b>stress</b> <b>molecules,</b> and that tumor epithelial cells can also express the NKG 2 D receptor that was thought to be exclusive of NK and cytotoxic lymphocytes is discussed as a possible mechanism of immunological escape and of tumor growth induction. </p...|$|R

40|$|The widely studied {{bacterium}} Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2. 4. 1 can cleave {{the abundant}} anti- <b>stress</b> <b>molecule</b> dimethylsulfoniopropionate into acrylate plus the environmentally important volatile dimethyl sulfide. It uses a DMSP-Iyase, encoded by dddL, the promoter-distal gene of a three-gene operon, acuR-acul-dddL. DMSP-cleavage and DMS production were previously {{shown to be}} slightly induced by pre-growth of cells with the substrate, DMSP. However, {{it was found that}} the catabolite acrylate was more effective and that the apparent the induction by DMSP requires its conversion to this bona fide eo-inducer. This unusual example of product-mediated regulation is controlled by the promoter-proximal gene acuR, which encodes a TetR-type transcriptional repressor. AcuR represses acuR-acul- dddL in the absence of acrylate, likely by binding to a palindromic eis-acting operator overlapping the acuR promoter. Unusually for bacteria, the acuk-acul-dddl: mRNA transcript is leaderless; it lacks a ribosome binding site and has no 5 '-untranslated region. The AcuR repressor was translated at a lower level compared to the downstream genes, and there is an absolute requirement for 5 '-terminal AUO-initiation codon of acuR. This regulatory unit may be widespread in bacteria, since several taxonomic ally distinct lineages have adjacent acuR-acul-like genes. These homologues are predicted to have no 5 '-untranslated region or ribosome binding sites, and their predicted operators resemble those of Rhodobacter sphaeroides acuR-acul-dddL. The AcuI polypeptide, a medium chain oxidoreductase, is predicted to be indirectly involved in the catabolism of acrylate, since Acul mutant cells were far more sensitive to the toxic effects of this molecule, yet could still convert acrylate to CO 2, albeit at lower levels than the wild type. Interestingly, acul-like genes are closely linked to a wide range of other genes involved in DMSP catabolism, in a range of bacterial types. A model for the possible evolution of the acuR-acul-dddL operon, and the possible function of its gene products is presented. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background IL- 6 is a pro-inflammatory {{cytokine}} {{that signals}} via binding to a soluble or membrane bound receptor, while nitric oxide (NO), an oxidative <b>stress</b> <b>molecule,</b> diffuses through the cell membrane without a receptor. Both mediators signal through different mechanisms, {{yet they are}} dependent on NFκB. We proposed that both mediators are co-induced and co-regulated in inflamed mammary epithelial cells. Methods SCp 2 mammary epithelial cells were treated with bacterial endotoxin (ET) for different time periods and analyzed for induction of IL- 6 secretion and NO production by ELISA and Griess reaction, respectively. The expression of IL- 6 and induced NO synthase (iNOS) was assayed by real time PCR and/or western immunoblots, and the activation of NFκB was assayed by immunobinding assay. To investigate the role of mammary cell microenvironment (cell-substratum or interaction of mammary epithelial cell types; critical to mammary development, function, and disease) in modulation of the inflammatory response, SCp 2 cells were cultured with or without extracellular matrix (EHS) or in coculture with their myoepithelial counterpart (SCg 6), and assayed for ET-induced IL- 6 and NO. Results Endotoxin induced NFκB activation at 1 h after ET application. IL- 6 secretion and NO production were induced, but with unexpected delay in expression of mRNA for iNOS compared to IL- 6. NFκB/p 65 activation was transient but NFκB/p 50 activation persisted longer. Selective inhibition of NFκB activation by Wedelolactone reduced ET-induced expression of IL- 6 mRNA and protein but not iNOS mRNA or NO production, suggesting differences in IL- 6 and iNOS regulation via NFκB. SCp 2 cells in coculture with SCg 6 but not in presence of EHS dramatically induced IL- 6 secretion {{even in the absence}} of ET. ET-induced NO production was blunted in SCp 2 /SCg 6 cocultures compared to that in SCp 2 alone. Conclusions The differential regulation of IL- 6 and iNOS together with the differential activation of different NFκB dimers suggest that IL- 6 and iNOS are regulated by different NFκB dimers, and differentially regulated by the microenvironment of epithelial cells. The understanding of innate immune responses and inflammation in epithelia and linkage thereof is crucial for understanding the link between chronic inflammation and cancer in epithelial tissues such as the mammary gland. </p...|$|E
50|$|Cytokines play {{a crucial}} role in NK cell activation. As these are <b>stress</b> <b>molecules</b> {{released}} by cells upon viral infection, they serve to signal to the NK cell the presence of viral pathogens in the affected area. Cytokines involved in NK activation include IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-2, and CCL5. NK cells are activated in response to interferons or macrophage-derived cytokines. They serve to contain viral infections while the adaptive immune response generates antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells that can clear the infection. NK cells work to control viral infections by secreting IFNγ and TNFα. IFNγ activates macrophages for phagocytosis and lysis, and TNFα acts to promote direct NK tumor cell killing. Patients deficient in NK cells prove to be highly susceptible to early phases of herpes virus infection.|$|R

Recent research shows that almost all communication between different parts of the body occurs by means of this psychosomatic network, a host of neurotransmitters, immunotransmitters, hormones and other chemical substances found in many different tissues in the body. Dr. Candace Pert calls these neuropeptides "molecules of emotion. " 2 We have neuropeptide receptors all over our bodies, including the gastrointestinal tract; the white blood cells...|$|R
50|$|Crystals undergo slow gradual {{change of}} {{frequency}} with time, known as aging. There are many mechanisms involved. The mounting and contacts may undergo relief of the built-in <b>stresses.</b> <b>Molecules</b> of contamination either from the residual atmosphere, outgassed from the crystal, electrodes or packaging materials, or introduced during sealing the housing can be adsorbed on the crystal surface, changing its mass; this effect is exploited in quartz crystal microbalances. The composition of the crystal can be gradually altered by outgassing, diffusion of atoms of impurities or migrating from the electrodes, or the lattice can be damaged by radiation. Slow chemical reactions may occur on or in the crystal, or on the inner surfaces of the enclosure. Electrode material, e.g. chromium or aluminium, can react with the crystal, creating layers of metal oxide and silicon; these interface layers can undergo changes in time. The pressure in the enclosure can change due to varying atmospheric pressure, temperature, leaks, or outgassing of the materials inside. Factors outside of the crystal itself are e.g. aging of the oscillator circuitry (and e.g. change of capacitances), and drift of parameters of the crystal oven. External atmosphere composition can also influence the aging; hydrogen can diffuse through nickel housing. Helium can cause similar issues when it diffuses through glass enclosures of rubidium standards.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Our {{previous}} {{studies showed that}} overexpression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) induced autophagy-mediated apoptosis in PNET cells. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and signaling cascades associated with SPARC overexpression in combination with radiation therapy that eventually leads to autophagy-mediated apoptosis in neuroblastoma. SPARC expression in SK-N-AS and NB- 1691 cells demonstrated the activation of caspase 3, cleavage of PARP and induction of apoptosis. The experiments to unravel the mechanisms associated with autophagy-apoptosis illustrated that SPARC overexpression triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and thereby unfolded protein response (UPR). This was apparent with the activation of stress receptors, inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE 1 α), RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) -like ER kinase (PERK) and BiP. This study further demonstrated the induction of transcription factor CHOP {{as a result of}} IRE-JNK activation in response to increased SPARC levels. Inhibition of ER stress and JNK activation led to inhibition of autophagy-mediated apop-tosis. Further, the apparent expression of ER <b>stress</b> <b>molecules</b> among the orthotopic tumors treated by SPARC overexpression plasmids substantiated our in vitro observations. Taken together, these results illustrate the critical role of ER stress in regulating autophagy-mediated apoptosis in SPARC-overexpressed neuro-blastoma cells and radiation treatment...|$|R

40|$|We present Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of liquid-crystalline material {{confined to a}} nanoscopic slit-pore. The simulations are carried out under isothermal conditions in a specialized isostress ensemble in which N fluid molecules are exposed to a compressional stress acting on the fluid in directions parallel with the substrate planes. Fluid-fluid and fluid-substrate interactions are modelled as in our previous work [M. Greschek et al., Soft Matter, 2010, DOI: 10. 1039 /B 924417 D). We study several anchoring mechanisms at the solid substrate by introducing an anchoring function (0 <g(u) < 1) {{that depends on the}} orientation of a fluid molecule relative to the substrate plane; g(u) "switches" the fluid-substrate attraction on or off. Here we focus on various heterogeneous (i. e., hybrid) anchoring scenarios imposing different anchoring functions at the opposite substrates. As in our previous study we compute the isostress heat capacity which allows us to identify states at which the confined fluid undergoes a structural transformation. The isotropic-nematic transformation turns out to be nearly independent of the specific anchoring scenario. This is because the director in the nematic phase assumes a direction that is a compromise between the directions enforced by the competing anchoring scenarios at either substrate. On the contrary, at lower compressional <b>stresses</b> <b>molecules</b> prealign in specific directions that depend on details of the anchoring scenario...|$|R
