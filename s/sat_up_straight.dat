25|$|Wieland's minimalism {{extended}} beyond the stage furniture and props. The performer of Gunther, for example, {{was expected to}} sing leaning forward in Act 1 of Götterdämmerung until he felt his authority challenged by Hagen and <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight.</b> It {{is hard to imagine}} a greater contrast with traditional operatic acting.|$|E
500|$|Then, I {{looked over}} and saw this man on the extreme right aisle sort of {{galloping}} to the podium. He was tall, he was thin, {{and the way he}} was galloping it looked as though he was going someplace much more important than the podium. ... He got to the podium—and I <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight.</b> I was impressed with him.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{critically}} and commercially successful films of Hoffman's career was The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), which he considered [...] "as edgy {{as you can get}} for a Hollywood movie". He played a [...] "preppy bully" [...] who taunts Matt Damon's Ripley in the thriller, a character which Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News called [...] "the truest upper class twit in all of American movies". Hoffman's performance caught the attention of Meryl Streep– another of his cinematic idols– with his performance: [...] "I <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> in my seat and said, 'Who is that?' I thought to myself: My God, this actor is fearless. He's done what we all strive for– he's given this awful character the respect he deserves, and he's made him fascinating." [...] In recognition of his work in Magnolia and The Talented Mr. Ripley, Hoffman was named the year's Best Supporting Actor by the National Board of Review.|$|E
60|$|With a start Bo <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straighter,</b> as if {{better to}} defend herself.|$|R
60|$|I <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> even <b>straighter</b> than my companion, {{and gazed}} steadfastly at him.|$|R
60|$|Miss Panney {{turned toward}} Mrs. Tolbridge, <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> in her chair, and glared.|$|R
60|$|She <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> on {{his knees}} and looked at him, afire with an idea.|$|E
60|$|He {{was just}} {{straightening}} out again when a peculiar rustling among the horses caught his ears. He {{listened for a}} moment, then <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> in his chair, and {{put down}} his cigar. [...] "I will begin," [...] he said, [...] "by stating that I am the Vizier of the Two-horned Alexander." ...|$|E
60|$|Pretty {{soon they}} came to a nice mossy green log right across the Lone Little Path. Peter Rabbit stopped and <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight.</b> He looked this way and looked that way. Johnny Chuck stopped too and he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> and looked this way and looked that way, but all he could see was the mossy green log across the Lone Little Path.|$|R
60|$|At this he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight,</b> on {{the extreme}} edge of his chair; his eyes sparkled.|$|R
6000|$|Alan {{bit his lip}} and Barbara <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> quite <b>straight</b> in her chair, observing which indications, Mr. Haswell went on hurriedly: ...|$|R
60|$|Inside the cab {{the fare}} <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> on the cushions, looking to {{right and left}} at the lights and houses. Even in the shadowed hansom her eyes shone like stars at twilight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take a {{drink of}} water, dear," [...] said her sister, and held the cup. Nellie took a sip and then Grace bathed her {{forehead}} with some water poured on a handkerchief that Sam passed over. Soon the girl <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Thomas Rooper {{took his}} pipe {{from his mouth}} and <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight.</b> Gazing steadfastly at his companion, he remarked, [...] "If {{you think that is}} such a good thing to do, why don't you do it yourself? There can't be anybody much harder up than you are." ...|$|E
60|$|Now Peter didn't {{want to hear}} it {{any more}} than Seek-Seek wanted to tell it, so while Peter squatted down comfortably, Seek-Seek <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> and began the story.|$|R
6000|$|The girl <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> {{and tilted}} her chin in the air. [...] "I would not wed with a walking diamond-mine," [...] she said. [...] "I {{will not have}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will do it,' {{replied the}} king; and he listened {{with all his}} might, till he judged that the white-faced horse was close to him. Then he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> and made ready.|$|R
60|$|Peter <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> and anxiously looked {{this way}} and that way. Jimmy Skunk {{was nowhere to be seen}} and Peter gave a little sigh of relief. Very {{carefully}} he walked around that nest and its little tunnel, then hurried over toward the fence as fast as he could go.|$|E
60|$|He ceased {{speaking}} {{to note the}} effect of his words on his hearers. They were electrical. The Sky Pilot <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> and slapped his thigh. Soup Face opened his mouth, letting his pipe fall out into his lap, setting fire to his ragged trousers. Dirty Eddie voiced a characteristic obscenity.|$|E
6000|$|Ken <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> {{with a very}} red face. It was his {{intention}} to leave the bench, but embarrassment that was developing into resentment held him fast. What a senseless lot these students were! Why could they not leave him in peace? How foolish of him to go wandering about in strange lecture-rooms! ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{tantamount}} to an avowal. Luke never flinched; he even contrived to smile. Louisa <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight,</b> {{and with an}} instinctive movement gave the sofa cushions a nervy shake up. But her eyes were fastened on Luke.|$|R
60|$|Happy Jack Squirrel <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> {{on the end}} of his log {{and spread}} his great bushy tail for a sail. All the little Breezes blew and blew and Happy Jack Squirrel sailed round and round the Smiling Pool.|$|R
6000|$|When {{finally she}} had gotten her breath and {{scrambled}} to her feet, Peter Rabbit was almost over to the friendly old brier patch. He stopped and <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight.</b> Then {{he put his hands}} on his hips and shouted: ...|$|R
60|$|Old Mr. Coulson groaned a little, {{and then}} <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> in his invalid's chair. He had the gout very bad in one foot, a house near Gramercy Park, {{half a million}} dollars and a daughter. And he had a housekeeper, Mrs. Widdup. The fact and the name deserve a {{sentence}} each. They have it.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{he heard}} her, put-a-put, put-a-put, hopping along the path, with a waving line of ferns to show just where she was. Kagax wriggled lower among his {{helpless}} victims; his eyes blazed red again, so red that Mother Hare saw them and stopped short. Then Kagax <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> {{among the dead}} babies and screeched in her face.|$|E
6000|$|Kate did not scream, nor moan, nor faint, but she <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> in {{her chair}} and gazed, with a wild intentness, at her uncle. No one spoke. At such a moment condolence or sympathy would have been a cruel mockery. They were all as pale as chalk. In his heart, Mr. Delaplaine said: [...] "I see it all; the Governor must have known, and he loved her so he could not break her heart." ...|$|E
5000|$|She {{walked into}} the room, {{and it was like}} the {{molecules}} shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't know who she was, but we all <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straighter.</b> We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every {{hair on the back of}} your neck stands up watching her act. When I went back home I couldn't think about anyone else. It wasn't even like I was thinking Priyanka has to play this, she had actually re-envisioned the character from my eyes. Safran on his first meeting with Chopra.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Sadler <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> in {{his chair}} and stared at the guide. [...] "Phil Matlack," [...] he shouted, [...] "what do you take me for? I hired that gun to that young man. Don't you suppose I know what I'm about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|To this {{question}} Mrs. Lecks made no answer, but <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> and stiff, {{with her back}} square upon the speaker. For some time she and Mr. Enderton had been [...] "out," [...] and she {{made no effort to}} conceal the fact.|$|R
60|$|Nettlewick <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> in his chair. He {{had listened}} patiently, but without {{consuming}} interest, to the major's story. It had impressed him as {{irrelevant to the}} situation, and it could certainly have no effect upon the consequences. Those Western people, he thought, had an exaggerated sentimentality. They were not business-like. They needed {{to be protected from}} their friends. Evidently the major had concluded. And what he had said amounted to nothing.|$|E
60|$|Many of {{the rabbits}} saw me, I am sure, for they {{sometimes}} gave a high jump over my foot; and one came close up beside it, and <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> {{with his head}} on one side, to look me over. Perhaps {{it was the first}} comer, for he did not try his scare again. Like most wild creatures, they have very little fear of an object that remains motionless at their first approach and challenge.|$|E
60|$|At this {{interchange}} of remarks, Ralph <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> in his chair, amazement in his countenance, while Miriam, {{ready to}} burst into a roar of laughter, waited convulsively {{to see what would}} happen next. Turning suddenly toward Ralph, Dora tore off her sunbonnet and dashed it to the floor. Standing there with her dishevelled hair, her flushed cheeks, her sparkling eyes and her quaint gown, Ralph thought her the most beautiful creature he had ever gazed upon.|$|E
6000|$|... "She doesn't know I'm {{out here}} at all," [...] thought Quacker. Then {{suddenly}} he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> and looked {{with all his}} might. What under the sun was the matter with that Fox? She was acting {{as if she had}} suddenly lost her senses.|$|R
2500|$|... "The {{first night}} I saw dailies," [...] replied art {{director}} Wallace, [...] "projected on a bedsheet in the producer's ratty apartment… My jaw dropped and I <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> so <b>straight</b> I {{cast a shadow}} with my head. This looked like a zillion dollars. This looked like a real movie." ...|$|R
60|$|But Jumper the Hare was timid, oh, very timid indeed. Every few jumps he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> to {{look this}} way and look that way, and to listen with his long ears. He jumped nervously at the least little noise. Yes, Sir, Jumper the Hare {{certainly}} was very timid.|$|R
