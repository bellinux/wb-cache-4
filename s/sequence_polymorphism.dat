Eastern Pacific populations are concentrated off the coast of Baja California, where upwelling provides rich feeding grounds for juvenile turtles and subadults. Nesting sites along the eastern Pacific Basin are rare. mtDNA <b>sequence</b> <b>polymorphism</b> analysis and tracking studies suggest 95% of the population along the coast of the Americas hatch on the Japanese Islands in the western Pacific. The turtles are transported by the prevailing currents across the full length of the northern Pacific, one of the longest migration routes of any marine animal. The return journey to the natal beaches in Japan has been long suspected, although the trip would cross unproductive clear water with few feeding opportunities. Evidence of a return journey came from an adult female loggerhead named Adelita, which in 1996, equipped with a satellite tracking device, made the 14,500 km (9,000 mi) trip from Mexico across the Pacific. Adelita was the first animal of any kind ever tracked across an ocean basin.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: The {{intrinsic}} DNA {{sequence is}} an important determinant of nucleosome positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation, while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. Results: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture on a genome scale in yeast. We found that <b>sequence</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> in nucleosomal DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in nucleosome-depleted DNA tend to inhibit nucleosome formation, which is especially evident at nucleosome-disfavored sequences in nucleosome-free regions {{at both ends of}} genes. <b>Sequence</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> facilitating nucleosome positioning correspond to stable nucleosome positioning.

Polymorphisms that are not detected as RFLPs are typically passed over in the screening process though they represent a potentially important source of informative genetic markers. We have used a rapid method for the detection of naturally occurring DNA sequence variations that is based on enzymatic amplification and direct sequencing of genomic DNA. This approach can detect essentially all useful sequence variations within the region screened.

50|$|To {{provide more}} context, {{in the latter}} study, the {{previously}} noted bimodular structure (C4A-C4B) has been updated to a quadrimodular structure of one to four discrete segments, containing one or more RP-C4-CYP21-TNX (RCCX) modules. The size of either C4A or C4B gene can be 21 kb (long, L) or 14.6 kb (short, S). Also, the long C4 gene uniquely contains a retrovirus HERV-K(C4) in its intron 9 that imposes transcription of an extra 6.36 kb, hence the “longer” string of gene. Thus, C4 genes have a complex pattern of variation in gene size, copy number, and polymorphisms. Examples of these mono-, bi-, tri-, and quadri-modular structures include: L or S (monomodular with one long or short C4 gene), LL or LS or SS (bimodular {{with a combination of}} homozygous or heterozygous L or S genes), LLL or LLS or LSS (trimodular RCCX with three L or S C4 genes), LLLL (quadrimodular structure with four L or S C4 genes). Interestingly, not all the structural groups have the same percentage of appearance, possibly even further differences within separate ethnic groups. For example, the Caucasian population studied showed 69% bimodular configuration (C4A-C4B, C4A-C4A, or C4B-C4B) and 31% trimodular configuration (equally split between LLL as C4A-C4A-C4B or LSS as C4A-C4B-C4B). Regarding C4 protein <b>sequence</b> <b>polymorphism,</b> a total of 24 polymorphic residues were found. Among them, the β-chain expressed of five, as the α-chain and γ-chain produced 18 and one, respectively.

The complete draft genome sequence of A. thiooxidans ATCC 19377 was determined using a whole-genome shotgun strategy and was revealed to contain a total of 3,019,868 base pairs in 164 contigs. The GC ratio {{was found to be}} 53.1% to 46.9%; 3,235 protein-coding genes were predicted in the genome of A. thiooxidans, which also contained 43 tRNAs, one complete and one partial 5S-16S-23S operon, and complete sets of genes for amino acid, nucleotide, inorganic sulfur compound, and central carbon metabolism. The genome also contains the genes sulfur quinone oxidoreductase (sqr), tetrathionate hydrolase (tetH), and thiosulfate quinone oxidoreductase (doxD), along with the two gene clusters that encode the sulfur oxidation complex SOX (soxYZB-hyp-resB-saxAX-resC and soxYZA-hyp-soxB), which were previously found in A. caldus and Thiobacillus denitrificans, a neutrophilic sulfur oxidizer.Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans strains have been differentiated from other related Acidithiobacilli, including A. ferrooxidans and A. caldus, by sequence analyses of the PCR-amplified 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer (ITS) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The strains of A. thiooxidans that were investigated by these researchers (metal mine isolates) yielded RFLP patterns that were identical to the A. thiooxidans type strain (ATCC 19377T), except for strain DAMS, which had a distinct pattern for all enzymes tested. All three Acidithiobacillus species were differentiated by phylogenetic analysis of the ITS sequences. The size and <b>sequence</b> <b>polymorphism</b> of the ITS3 region contributed to the inter- and infraspecific genetic variations that were detected in this analysis. No significant correlation was shown by Mantel tests between the similarity of ITS sequences and the geographical origin of strains. Bergamo et al. (2004) concluded that the 16S-23S rDNA spacer region is a useful target for developing molecular methods that focus on the detection, rapid differentiation and identification of Acidithiobacillus species.|$|E

To dissect the interplay of siRNA-mediated regulation and TE evolution, and to examine how TE differences affect nearby gene expression, we investigated genome-wide differences in TEs, siRNAs, and gene expression among three Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Both TE <b>sequence</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> and presence of linked TEs are positively correlated with intraspecific variation in gene expression. The expression of genes within 2 kb of conserved TEs is more stable than that of genes next to variant TEs harboring <b>sequence</b> <b>polymorphisms.</b> Polymorphism levels of TEs and closely linked adjacent genes are positively correlated as well. We also investigated the distribution of 24 -nt-long siRNAs, which mediate TE repression. TEs targeted by uniquely mapping siRNAs are on average farther from coding genes, apparently because they more strongly suppress expression of adjacent genes. Furthermore, siRNAs, and especially uniquely mapping siRNAs, are enriched in TE regions missing in other accessions. Thus, targeting by uniquely mapping siRNAs appears to promote sequence deletions in TEs. Overall, our work indicates that siRNA-targeting of TEs may influence removal of sequences from the genome and hence evolution of gene expression in plants...|$|R
