50|$|In the United States, a {{medallion}} <b>signature</b> <b>guarantee</b> is {{a special}} <b>signature</b> <b>guarantee</b> for the transfer of securities. It is a guarantee by the transferring financial institution that the signature is genuine and the financial institution accepts liability for any forgery. Signature guarantees protect shareholders by preventing unauthorized transfers and possible investor losses. They also limit the liability of the transfer agent who accepts the certificates.|$|E
50|$|A {{medallion}} <b>signature</b> <b>guarantee</b> is {{a binding}} warranty, issued by {{an agent of}} the authorized guarantor institution, that: (a) the signature was genuine; (b) the signer was an appropriate person to endorse, and (c) the signer had legal capacity to sign. A medallion <b>signature</b> <b>guarantee</b> is not equivalent to an American Notarial act. One American Notarial act, called an acknowledgment, is a formal declaration made before an authorized public officer (i.e. Notary Public, Judge or Justice). It is made by a person executing an instrument who states it was his “free act and deed”. The three essential components of an acknowledgment are: (a) the personal appearance before an authorized public officer; (b) positive identification; (c) the actual acknowledgment of signing. Unlike medallion signature guarantees, the person executing many legal documents does not have to sign his name in the physical presence of the issuing officer (i.e. Notary Public, Judge or Justice).|$|E

5000|$|Stock {{transfer}} {{agents in}} the United States verify that owners of stock are genuine {{through the use of}} signature guarantees. This {{is often referred to as}} a [...] "Medallion Signature Guarantee". A <b>signature</b> <b>guarantee</b> is a warranty by the signature guarantor that the endorser of a stock certificate or stock power form is an appropriate person to endorse and thus transfer the security. Signatures on a stock certificate or stock power must have the medallion guarantee. A medallion guarantee is also used to validate the genuineness of a securities transaction document (typically a stock certificate). It is backed by a bond and protects the issuer of the security and their transfer agent from fraudulently transferred securities. A medallion guarantee may be obtained from most major banks, brokerage firms or credit unions.|$|E

Parents must also send an academic assessment to the superintendent from the previous school year. The academic assessment report needs to be one of two things: either the results of a nationally normed, standardized test or a written portfolio. The portfolio should include samples of the student’s work. The superintendent must notify the parents within fourteen days of his/her decision.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We extend {{classical}} first-order logic with subtyping by type predicates {{and type}} coercion. Type predicates {{assert that the}} value of a term belongs to a more special type than the <b>signature</b> <b>guarantees,</b> while type coercion allows using terms of a more general type where the signature calls for a more special one. These operations are important e. g. in the specification and verification of object-oriented programs. We present a tableau calculus for this logic and prove its completeness. ...|$|R

Compared {{with the previous}} schemes, the proposed scheme has lower computations and shorter signature size. By conversely using the proposed partially blind signature, a fair e-payment protocol is given. An advantage of this protocol is that two participants achieve the goals of exchanging their items without intervention of a third party. The low computations and good properties of the underlying partially blind <b>signature</b> <b>guarantee</b> that the proposed protocol has needed efficiency and security. ...|$|E

Digital signature provides three types of services such as authentication, message integrity and non-repudiation, but does not provide the confidentiality of data which is most important during data transfer because the data is very sensitive. In this paper, we proposed a modified RSA digital signature scheme for data confidentiality. The main purpose of this approach is to provide the data confidentiality during the data transfer. To achieve this we are using the concept of public key encryption...|$|R

40|$|Digital {{signature}} authentication scheme provides secure communication between two users. Digital <b>signatures</b> <b>guarantee</b> end-to-end message integrity and authentication {{information about the}} origin of a message. Digital signature schemes reduce transmission costs, because the message is contained in the signature itself and no separate message and signature need be sent again. These schemes are very suitable for key exchange applications, due to the small size of the key. In this paper, we present a new digital signature scheme with message recovery based on knapsack based elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Elliptic curve cryptosystem provides greater security compared to integer factorization system and discrete logarithm system, for any given key size and bandwidth. In our scheme, using ECC and then applying the knapsack generates the signature. Our scheme is secure against most of the current attacking mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Group {{communication}} {{is an important}} technique for many network computing applications. In group communication, a member in a group {{sends a message to}} others normally by multicast. Group <b>signature</b> <b>guarantees</b> the integrity of the exchanged data and provides source authentication. In a virtual machine (VMs) based computing system, a virtual machine monitor (VMM) allows applications to run in different VMs strongly isolated from each other. A trusted VMM (TVMM) based platform can provide stronger security protection for group signature systems than traditional computing platforms can. The authors first introduce a TVMM-based group signature architecture and a TVMM security protection mechanism for group signature components. Then, the authors propose a group signature scheme using the function of message checking based on the discrete logarithm problem. Finally, the authors prove the correctness of the group signature scheme and analyse its security in virtual computing environments. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{insights}} {{gained from}} present land cover classification activities suggest integration of multi-angle data into classification attempts for future progress. Land cover types that exhibit distinct signatures {{in the space}} of remote sensing data facilitate unambiguous identification of cover types.

In the first part (Zhang et al., 2001), empirical arguments in support of the consistency principle were presented. This part provides a theoretical justification of the consistency requirements. Radiative transfer best explains the physics of the processes operative in the generation of the signal in the optical remote sensing data.

40|$|The Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) {{protocol}} {{has been}} proposed by a consortium of credit card companies and software corporations to secure e-commerce transactions. When the customer makes a purchase, the SET dual <b>signature</b> <b>guarantees</b> authenticity while keeping the customer’s account details secret from the merchant and his choice of goods secret from the bank. This paper reports the first verification results for the complete purchase phase of SET. Using Isabelle and the inductive method, we showed that the credit card details do remain confidential and customer, merchant and bank can confirm most details of a transaction even when some of those details are kept from them. The complex protocol construction makes proofs more difficult but still feasible. Though enough goals can be proved to give confidence in SET, a lack of explicitness in the dual signature makes some agreement properties fail: {{it is impossible to}} prove that the customer meant to sent his credit card details to the payment gateway that receives them...|$|R

40|$|Digital video {{has become}} {{increasingly}} susceptible to spario-temporal manipulations {{as a result of}} recent advances in video editing tools. In this paper, we propose a secure and flexible fragile digital video authentication watermark which also enables the self-recovery of video content after malicious manipulations. In the proposed block-based method, the watermark payload of a block is composed of two parts: authentication and recovery packets. The authentication packet is a digital signature with a special structure and carries the spario-temporal position of the block. The digital <b>signature</b> <b>guarantees</b> the authenticity and integrity of the block as well as the recovery packet, whereas the localization information prevents possible cut&; paste attacks. On the other hand, the recovery packet contains a highly compressed version of a spario-temporally distant block. This information enables the recovery of the distant block, upon detection of tampering by its authentication packet. A spariotemporal interleaving scheme and a simple multiple description coding mechanism increase the probability of self recovery by diffusing recovery information throughout the sequence. Finally, watermark payload is embedded by least significant bit modulation...|$|R
