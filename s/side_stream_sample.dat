40|$|Sodium {{polyacrylate}} (Na-PA) is a super absorbent polymer, {{which is}} commonly used in diverse hygiene products. The polymer is currently produced from fossil feedstock and its production consequently leads to adverse environmental impacts. Na-PA production from sugars present in pulp mill <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> can potentially be a successful way to achieve a more sustainable production of this polymer. In order to guide {{the development of a}} novel biochemical process for producing Na-PA, a life cycle assessment was done in which Na-PA produced from <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> of thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) and sulfite pulp mills were compared. Furthermore, a comparison was made with Na-PA produced from fossil resources. The results show that the main determinant of the environmental impact of the bio-based Na-PA production is the free sugar content in the <b>side</b> <b>streams.</b> The lowest environmental impact is achieved by the least diluted <b>side</b> <b>streams.</b> More diluted <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> require larger amounts of energy for concentration, and, if the diluted streams are not concentrated, processes such as hydrolysis and detoxification, and fermentation are the environmental hotspots. Furthermore, the higher the yield of the fermentation process, the lower the environmental impact will be. Lastly, the production of bio-based Na-PA led to a lower global warming potential for some of the considered pulp mill <b>side</b> <b>streams,</b> but all of the other impacts considered were higher, when compared to fossil-based Na-PA production. Therefore, in parallel with efforts to develop a high-yield yeast for the fermentation process, technology developers should focus on low energy concentration processes for the <b>side</b> <b>streams...</b>|$|R

40|$|The AQUAREL project {{studied the}} {{availability}} and optional utilization methods for fish processing <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> and other aquatic biomaterial in the Republic of Karelia. Additionally processing aquatic biomaterial with manure and sewage sludge was studied. Based on the results, the most feasible option today is to process fish <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> to fish oil and dewatered oil-free residue and to use them for fish or animal feed production. However, {{it is necessary to}} highlight, that changes in e. g. economic environment, energy prices and demand may require re-evaluating the results and conclusions made in the project. Producing fish oil from fish processing <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> is an easy and relatively simple production process generating a valuable end product. The functionality of the process was confirmed in a pilot conducted in the project. The oil and solids are separated from the heated fish waste based on gravity. The fish oil separating on top of the separator unit is removed. Fish oil can as such be utilized for heating purposes, fish meal or animal feed production, {{but it can also be}} further processed to biodiesel. However, due to currently moderate energy prices in Russia, biodiesel production is not economically profitable. Even if the fish oil production process is not complicated, the operative management of small-scale fish oil production unit requires dedicated resources and separate facilities especially to meet hygiene requirements. Managing the <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> is not a core business for fish farmers. Efficient and economically profitable fish oil production requires a centralized production unit with bigger processing capacity. One fish processing unit needs to be designed to manage <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> collected from several fish farms. The optimum location for the processing unit is in the middle of the fish farms. Based on the transportation cost analysis in the Republic of Karelia, it is not economically efficient to transport bio-wastes for more than 100 km since the transportation costs start increasing substantially. Another issue to be considered is that collection of <b>side</b> <b>streams,</b> including the dead fish, from the fish farms should be organized on a daily basis in order to eliminate the need for storing the <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> at the farms. Based on AQUAREL project studies there are different public funding sources available for supporting and enabling profitable and environmentally sustainable utilization, research or development of fish processing <b>side</b> <b>streams</b> and other aquatic biomaterial.

High concentrations (10 ^ 3 - 10 ^ 4 / 100 ml) of FC and FS could be recovered from <b>samples</b> of <b>stream</b> waters obtained from unpolluted and polluted sites. Most of the stream-water samples collected in urbanized areas, but upstream from the sewage effluent discharge site (unpolluted stream), contained higher concentrations of FC than the 200 to 400 FC/ 100 ml considered by state and federal laws as being polluted with fecal matter and as a possible source of enteric pathogens. Only after analyzing <b>stream</b> <b>samples</b> for concentrations and the ratio of FC and FS, as well as concentrations of phosphates, was it possible to determine which <b>stream</b> <b>samples</b> {{did or did not}} contain sewage effluent. The results show that the impact of sewage effluent discharge into streams on Oahu, Hawaii, cannot be properly evaluated by analyzing the <b>stream</b> <b>samples</b> for only FC as mandated by law. Moreover, it should no longer be assumed that stream-water quality upstream of the sewage effluent discharge point is superior to that of the effluent entering the stream.

Here, we explore the presence of randomness in river network structure and the details of its consequences.

This scaling of drainage density is shown to imply Tokunaga's law, {{a description of the}} scaling of side branch abundance along a given stream, as well as a scaling law for stream lengths.

Amongst natural products of current interest for food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and chemical industries is methyl chavicol (MC). MC is a natural ingredient found in several herbs as tarragon, sweet basil, sweet fennel, and their essential oils, and its widest application is in food industry as flavoring agent. In this work, basil essential oil was used as raw material to study MC concentration through a hybrid evaporation system. The evaporative system was constituted of a cylindrical evaporator, an internal condenser located concentrically to the evaporator, and an external condenser. It generates 3 outside streams: distilled, side, and residue, which were recovered {{at the bottom of}} external condenser, internal condenser, and evaporator, respectively. From experimental results, it was verified that higher MC concentration was reached at the <b>side</b> <b>stream</b> because its intermediate volatility when compared with other substances present in basil essential oil. Central composite experimental design using 2 factors and 4 replicates at central point was considered in this work to determine the effect of operating conditions on methyl chavicol separation.
