40|$|This {{research}} project examined the numerous factors affecting rural Catholic grade {{schools in the}} Archdiocese of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, {{and their ability to}} remain a viable educational option for families of rural communities in Southeastern Wisconsin. The literature review provides the history of Catholic education in the United States and details how changing demographics over the past 40 to 50 years within the Catholic population provides significant challenges for this educational model to continue in any geographic setting [...] inner city, urban, suburban, or rural. The use of interviews assisted with gathering qualitative data to understand the challenges facing the four rural Catholic grade schools participating in this research effort and how successful grade schools tackle these challenges. The findings indicate that while rural Catholic grade schools may have the support of their local parishes, the schools may not have the full support of parents of school-age children. So while the parish may support the school, there is simply no Catholic grade school without children. Thus, rural Catholic grade schools in the Milwaukee Archdiocese are left facing a path of <b>strategic</b> <b>consolidation</b> and regionalization in order for a chance to survive. More importantly, the local parishes of these communities are left with the overwhelming task of re-invigorating the parents of school-age children and infusing in the parents a willingness to accept Catholic culture fo...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} sector, {{an industry}} already facing stiff {{challenges in the}} form of intensified competition and <b>strategic</b> <b>consolidation,</b> has increasingly become subject to a range of pressures. Crucially, in common with other large-scale businesses, pharmaceutical firms find themselves 'invited' to respond positively to the corporate 'social' responsibility (CSR) expectations of their stakeholders. Consequently, individual managers will almost certainly be obliged to engage in some form of stakeholder dialogue and this, in turn, means that they will have to make difficult choices about which practices to adopt. This real-world management predicament runs parallel to an academic interest in CSR stakeholder dialogue theory and models. Accordingly, the approach {{of this paper is to}} focus primarily on the academic debate surrounding stakeholder dialogue, by reviewing past attempts to research and theorise the subject, by identifying gaps and weaknesses in the literature, and by proposing a new analytical model. The central aim of the proposed new model is to offer a unified, structured, systematic, and comprehensive approach to CSR decision making whilst simultaneously providing a practical framework for CSR executives who face the challenge of responding in an effective manner to stakeholders. The model outlined here is currently being employed to conduct international comparative empirical research into stakeholder dialogue practices amongst UK and German pharmaceutical firms. In the longer term the intention is to use the model to undertake international comparative research encompassing a broader range of countries and industries. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Memory tests able to {{differentiate}} encoding and retrieval processes from the memoranda storing ones {{should be used}} {{to differentiate}} patients in a very early phase of AD. In fact, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be characterized by two different memory profiles: a pure amnestic one (with poor learning and retrieval and poor improvement when encoding is assisted and retrieval is facilitated) and a dysexecutive one (with inefficient encoding and/or poor retrieval strategies and improvement with assisted encoding and retrieval). The amnestic profile characterizes subjects affected by medio-temporal atrophy typical of AD. In this study, a Grober-Buschke memory procedure was used to evaluate normal controls and MCI patients with different cognitive profiles: pure amnestic (aMCIsd), amnestic plus other cognitive impairments (aMCImd) and non-amnestic (naMCI). An index of sensitivity of cueing (ISC) measured the advantage passing from free to cued recall. Results showed that both <b>strategic</b> and <b>consolidation</b> abilities were impaired in the aMCIsd and aMCImd groups and were preserved in the naMCI group. aMCImd, however, compensated the memory deficit with assisted encoding and retrieval, but aMCIsd performed very poorly. When MCI subjects were defined according to the ISC value, subjects with poor ISC were primarily in the aMCIsd group and, to a lesser extent, in the aMCImd group and the naMCI group. Finally, patients with a poor ISC showed cerebral atrophy documented in the precocious phase of AD and the retrosplenial cerebral areas seemed to be the most useful areas for identifying patients in the early phase of AD...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{influence}} of us Asian policy {{on the evolution of}} Taiwanese nationalism and the role of Taiwanese nationalism in America's Asian policy. The study consists of five parts. The first part (1895 - 1950) introduces the source of Taiwanese nationalism and America's strategic scheme on Taiwan before 1945, and explores American options after the germination of Taiwanese nationalism. America's intention to separate Taiwan from the mainland so as to deny the island to Chinese Communists late 1948 helped preserve inchoate Taiwanese nationalism. The second part (1950 - 1970) examines how America simultaneously exploited the Chinese Nationalist regime's anti-communism and facilitated the growth of Taiwanese nationalism in the bipolarized Cold-War era. The Truman administration's separatist intention after the Korean War, US aid and American scholars' Taiwan independence theories had significant implications for the evolution of Taiwanese nationalism. The third part (1970 - 1989) examines how America reconciled US-PRC rapprochement with its promotion of Taiwanese nationalism. Taiwan's democratisation evolved in the context of US political, economic and military intervention. During the transition to democratisation, secessionists turned political opposition movement into nation-building revolution. The fourth part (1989 - 2000) examines how US conservatives and Taiwanese nationalists jointly promoted Taiwanization. The dynamics of democratisation, native president Lee Teng-hui's domination of political agenda, the ambience of US-Taiwan strategic realignment and the maturity of political nationalism together facilitated Taiwanization. The fifth part (2000 ֊present) explores how America and Taiwan establish a strategic symbiosis for US-China strategic competition. The 9 / 11 Incident has little influence on the course of <b>strategic</b> symbiosis. The <b>consolidation</b> of Taiwan identity obliged thepan-blue camp to identify with Taiwan, promote political nationalism and deviate from their pro-unification ideology. The increased antagonism between Taiwanese nationalism and Chinese nationalism ossifies the symbiotic partnership between USAsian policy and Taiwanese nationalism and hinders China's rise to regional hegemonyand global superpower.

40|$|The Chemistry & Materials Sciences (C&MS) Directorate is in {{the third}} year of a {{four-year}} space consolidation plan. In 1994, approximately half of the total directorate square footage was comprised of 40 -year old wet chemistry research buildings that had exceeded their useful life and were viewed a legacy facilities to the program. This mix of old vs. new laboratory space was not properly aligned nor suited for future needs of C&MS, from both the cultural or economic position, thus change was needed. C&MS instituted an aggressive, <b>strategic,</b> business-driven space <b>consolidation</b> initiative, called SAT (Space Action Team), to optimize space utilization, reduce annual costs, meet strategic program needs, and consolidate activities by functional area. The plan called for a 4 -year process beginning in FY 95 to realign the directorate`s facility portfolio through relocations, consolidations, transfer of facility ownership, demolition of trailers and new construction with a 20 % sq/ft reduction as an end goal. As with all business driven initiatives, existing operating costs, implementation costs, cost avoidance and future operating costs were key metrics to measure against the strategic goal. Where P 2 was not an essential element in the strategic planning process, it {{played a key role in}} the continuing success of the process. SAT is in year three of the four year plan (approximate $ 5 million investment), which has made a major contribution to the success of C&MS by achieving the directorate`s goals of improving the utilization of space by 30 %, increasing quality of the facilities, and reducing annual operating costs. To date, SAT has achieved an on-going organizational facility charge saving of $ 2 million /year, minimized Program downtime, transferred 120, 000 sq ft to new owners, relocated 86 labs, vacated 9 buildings, deactivate, decommissioned and decontaminated four 40 plus year old R&D facilities, and demolished 9 trailers with no incidents or injuries.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Agriculture {{has always}} been a very {{volatile}} industry, mainly due to fluctuating commodity prices (specifically white maize) and irregular rainfall patterns. Furthermore, the agricultural industry is confronted with finite resources of which limited arable land and water scarcity are among the most troubling. Many agribusinesses in the industry have also achieved a level of maturity as far as market share is concerned, leaving little room for further growth. On the other hand, most of these agri-businesses are organisations with shareholders and investors demanding acceptable and sustainable returns on their investments. This situation invariably creates challenges relating to growth, profitability and sustainability. One of the few ways of addressing this problem is for stakeholders in the industry to combine their resources, capabilities and efforts through consolidation strategies, like acquisitions, mergers and strategic alliances, among others. This includes an extended presence and involvement throughout the value chain by means of forward and backward integration. The aim of such consolidation activity is to improve the long-term sustainability of agri-businesses and the agricultural industry as a whole. Agriculture is extremely important in terms of its contribution to the national economy, employment and job creation, earning foreign exchange through exports and improving food security and safety as well as the affordability of and access to food. Agri-businesses fulfil the functions of handlers, processors and marketers of agricultural produce, suppliers of production inputs and services including mechanisation solutions and support as well as being financiers of farmers and farming activities. However, there are too many role players and intermediaries involved in the agricultural industry which only aggravates the problem of limited growth potential within the industry. This study focuses on one of the leading agribusinesses in the industry {{while at the same time}} aiming to obtain the opinions of other industry stakeholders regarding the desirability of such consolidation strategies, the nature and extent thereof and the probability of successfully executing such strategies within the industry. Qualitative empirical research was performed by using a semi-structured interview schedule and conducting personal or telephonic interviews with a selection of executives, directors and other senior managers of several agri-businesses, regulators and controlling bodies associated with the South African agricultural industry. The themes covered included growth and sustainability, <b>strategic</b> leadership, <b>consolidation</b> as strategy, the different consolidation approaches, consolidation methods to be used, motives for consolidation, possible legislative restrictions on consolidation, the steps in the consolidation process and the preferred business approach to execute a consolidation strategy. The results of the empirical study indicated that consolidation does support growth and sustainability and that sound strategic leadership is of strategic importance to agri-businesses. The majority of participants confirmed that consolidation does form part of their current strategies and agreed that a combination of the three different consolidation approaches will be most effective in the execution of a consolidation strategy. Of the different <b>consolidation</b> methods, <b>strategic</b> alliances was the most preferred method as well as being selected as the method most likely to successfully achieve industry consolidation. Value creation was the overwhelming choice as being the primary motive for consolidation and was also selected as the motive with the highest probability of achieving success in consolidating the agricultural industry. The restrictive nature of the South African Competition Act (89 of 1998) and the competition authorities was highlighted by the responses obtained from the interviewees. Even though the negotiation phase was described as the most important step in the consolidation process, the results showed that is critically important to accommodate all the different steps in the process to ensure the success of the entire consolidation project. Finally, there was no clear preference regarding the business approach to apply in executing a consolidation strategy, being either a focuses business approach or an integrated business philosophy. The recommendations contained suggestions to increase consolidation activity among stakeholders in the industry and to develop and establish sufficient consolidation skills and capacity to aggressively pursue a consolidation strategy. It was also suggested that agri-businesses should reverse previous decisions to limit shareholding within these organisations. Any consolidation approach and consolidation method which is based on willing and amicable participation of the parties involved, benefits these stakeholders and the industry. These transactions must hold some benefit or value for those parties involved as well as other stakeholders in the industry. The principle of embracing the competition authorities and the requirements of the South African Competition Act (89 of 1998) as part of the consolidation process was strongly advocated. Ultimately, the business approach which best supports the organisation’s strategy is the obvious choice, but the reality is that it might include characteristics of both an integrated and a focussed approach.

40|$|Esta dissertação toma por objeto de pesquisa a ação pedagógica desenvolvida pelo "terceiro setor" na Região Metropolitana de Campinas (RMC). Tendo por objetivo a análise crítica dos projetos desenvolvidos pela Federação das Entidades Assistenciais de Campinas (FEAC) e do Centro de Educação e Assessoria Popular (CEDAP), procuramos entendê-los à luz das transformações ocorridas no pós-Guerra, passando pela crise mundial dos anos de 1970 e seus desdobramentos. Entre os principais fenômenos que são a expressão desse período, destacamos a reestruturação produtiva do capital e a ascensão do neoliberalismo, com suas implicações no âmbito econômico, epistemológico e, sobretudo, educacional. Procurou-se interpretar a transição das "lógicas do Estado" para as "lógicas da sociedade civil", tendo por referencial teórico metodológico o conceito gramsciano de "Estado integral" e sua ênfase na categoria de hegemonia, importante {{instrumental}} para o entendimento da complexa sedimentação social que dará sustentação ao Estado que emergiu após a crise de hegemonia do capital. O marco temporal para a análise do objeto foi o contexto que se estendeu do final dos anos de 1950 até os dias atuais, passando pela chamada redemocratização brasileira, a partir da década de 1980. Este período foi fortemente influenciado pelos desdobramentos da Guerra Fria e a ação ideológica estadunidense, fundamentada na filosofia do "comunitarismo", em contraposição aos movimentos populares de cunho contestatório que atuavam no Brasil. Seus desdobramentos perpassam o "golpe civil-militar", período em que foi gestado o substrato ideológico que em nosso entendimento fundamentará a emergência do "terceiro setor" e sua ação estratégica de consolidação do "novo" consenso neoliberal. A estratégia que se revela é o pragmatismo das saídas comunitárias, cujo efeito maior é inviabilizar as perspectivas históricas transformadoras, controlando as iniciativas dos subalternos e impondo um novo consenso, através de uma "pedagogia da hegemonia". Tal pedagogia passa a ser aplicada não somente pelas escolas oficiais, mas, efetivamente, pelas iniciativas do "terceiro setor", instrumentalizando-se em benefício do capital as saídas articuladas pela classe trabalhadora. Com um rico histórico de lutas sociais, a RMC configura-se em um importante espaço em que, não sem resistências, as estratégias do "terceiro setor" fincaram suas raízes, tornando-se um importante laboratório para se desvelar o "novo canto da sereia" em educação. This dissertation takes search object by {{the pedagogical}} action {{developed by the}} "third sector" in the metropolitan region of Campinas (RMC). Having objective critical analysis of the projects developed by the Federation of Charities of Campinas (FEAC) and the Popular Education Center (CEDAP) and advise, we seek to understand them {{in the light of}} the transformations that have occurred in the post-war period, passing by the global crisis of the years of 1970 and its unfoldings. Among the main phenomena that are the expression of that period, we highlight the productive restructuring of capital and the rise of neoliberalism, with their implications for economic, educational, and epistemological. Tried to interpret the transition of the State's "logical" to the logical "civil society", having by methodological theoretical reference the concept of Gramsci of "integral State" and its emphasis on instrumental category of hegemony, important for the understanding of complex social sedimentation that will the State that emerged after the crisis of hegemony of capital. The timeframe for the analysis of object was the context that spanned the end of the years of 1950 to the present day, passing by the so-called Brazilian re-democratization, from the Decade of 1980. This period was heavily influenced by the developments of the cold war and the American ideological action, grounded in the philosophy of "communitarianism", as opposed to popular movements that acted in Brazil questionable imprint. Its unfoldings permeate the "civil-military coup," was conceived during the period in which ideological substrate that emergency shall justify in our understanding of the "third sector" and its <b>strategic</b> action of <b>consolidation</b> of the "new" neoliberal consensus. The strategy that is revealed is the pragmatism of community output, whose greater effect is derail the historic perspective, controlling manufacturing initiatives of junior officers and imposing a new consensus, through a "pedagogy of "hegemony. Such pedagogy happens to be applied not only by the official schools, but, effectively, by the initiatives of the "third sector", by actually Instrumenting-if for the benefit of capital by working class outputs articulated. With a rich history of social struggles, the RMC is in an important area in which, not without resistance, the strategies of the "third sector" put down its roots, becoming an important laboratory for unveiling "new corner of Mermaid" in education...|$|R
