5|$|The {{demand for}} {{selenium}} by the electronics industry is declining, despite {{a number of}} continuing applications. Its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties are still useful in photocopying, photocells, light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although {{it was still a}} large end-use) as more and more copiers switched to organic photoconductors. Though once widely used, selenium rectifiers have mostly been replaced (or are being replaced) by silicon-based devices. The most notable exception is in power DC <b>surge</b> <b>protection,</b> where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal oxide varistors.|$|E

40|$|The {{electric}} transients generated {{during the}} switching of a breaker placed near the transformer {{in a system}} with {{a substantial amount of}} cables can have a very short rise time and can reach very high magnitudes. In practice, the magnitude of the voltage surges is usually limited using the surge arresters while the rise time of the surge to which the apparatus is exposed, remains unchanged. In this paper, the characteristic of the switching transients generated in the MV cable grids are analyzed. For this purpose, cases with both dry-type and oil insulated transformers are studied. These cases are typical for a MV industrial grid and a wind park (WP) collection grid. Furthermore, the case with and without <b>surge</b> arrester <b>protection</b> is analyzed in order to observe the impact of the surge arresters on the voltage surges. Simulations show that the magnitude of the voltage surges exceeds the basic lightning impulse insulation level (BIL) defined by present standards. Furthermore, the rise time of the voltage surges is much shorter compared to the rise time of the lightning impulse {{especially in the case of}} the dry-type transformers and the WP collection grid. When surge arresters are used, the magnitude of the surges is limited to the BIL but the rise times of the surges can be twenty five times shorter compared to the BIL. Only when surge arresters are used with other fast transient mitigation equipment such as RC <b>protection</b> or <b>surge</b> capacitor <b>protection,</b> the magnitude of very fast voltage surges are brought down...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{issues to be}} noted {{regarding}} behavior of transient voltage surge suppressors (TVSS) incorporating MOVs under over-voltage conditions. Depending {{on the level of}} conducted current, dissipated heat may be insufficient to cause failure, but may degrade the MOV device and reduce its life expectancy. If excessive current is conducted by a MOV, it may fail catastrophically, keeping the load connected, but now without any <b>surge</b> <b>protection.</b> [...] A user may have no indication when the surge suppressor has failed. Under the right conditions of over-voltage and line impedance, {{it may be possible to}} cause the MOV to burst into flames, the root cause of many fires and the main reason for NFPA’s concern resulting in UL1449 in 1986 and subsequent revisions in 1998 and 2009. Properly designed TVSS devices must not fail catastrophically, resulting in the opening of a thermal fuse or something equivalent that only disconnects MOV devices.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the rotary converter over the discrete motor-generator set is that the rotary converter avoids converting all of the power flow into mechanical energy and then back into electrical energy; some of the electrical energy instead flows directly from input to output, allowing the rotary converter to be much smaller and lighter than a motor-generator set of an equivalent power-handling capability. The advantages of a motor-generator set include adjustable voltage regulation which can compensate for voltage drop in the supply network; it also provided complete power isolation, harmonics isolation, greater <b>surge</b> and transient <b>protection,</b> and sag (brownout) protection through increased momentum.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: For {{the last}} decades, the design floods of {{numerous}} embankment reservoirs were re-evaluated and the revised spillway outflows are typically {{larger than those}} used in the original designs. As a result, a number of overtopping protection systems were developed for embankments and earthfill dams, with applications encompassing river dykes, coastal barriers for storm <b>surge</b> and tsunami <b>protections.</b> Several design techniques were developed for embankments and earthfill dams. These include concrete overtopping protection systems, timber cribs, sheet-piles, riprap and gabions, reinforced earth, minimum energy loss (MEL) weirs, embankment overflow stepped spillways and the precast concrete block protection systems. Various designs are reviewed herein and discussed based upon prototype experiences. This review highlights that a safe operation of embankment overflow protection systems relies upon a sound design and a good quality of construction, suitable flow conditions, together with regular maintenance...|$|R

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to analyse the {{socio-economic}} transformations of the European Union, {{an increasing number of}} scholars have resorted to Polanyi's double movement thesis. In doing so, some scholars, by looking at the evidence of intensified marketisation of social relations, consider the EU disembedded; whereas others identify a re-embedding tendency in the recent <b>surge</b> of socio-environmental <b>protection.</b> The paper follows Lacher, Burawoy, Dale and Streeck's readings of Polanyi and argues that the exiting socio-environmental provisions do not re-embed the economy. Socio-environmental protection does not eclipse the neoliberal accumulation strategy which continues to propagate the disembedding tendency, because it fails to decommodify fictitious commodities. The EU is characterised by a heightened intensification of both disembedding and protective tendencies, which Polanyi contends is disruptive in nature. What emerges out of the dialectics between neoliberalisation and socio-environmental provisions is a decelerated rate of change, which, although it temporarily secures the habitation of man, prevents the inception of a synthesis that is capable of sublating the contradictions of the marketisation/protection binary. Moreover, we have a paradoxical situation wherein the socio-environmental measures, despite their protective invocation, are predicated on deepened commodification.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to protect the Greater Houston Metropolitan Area from {{hurricane}} storm surge damage, four Levee-in-Dune concepts are studied {{as part of the}} Ike Dike project. The Ike Dike is a proposed hurricane surge barrier developed by Dr. William Merrell at Texas A&M University at Galveston and is based on best practices developed by the Dutch. The project would span 62 mi including a levee system along the Galveston and Bolivar coasts, and a channel barrier across Bolivar Roads. This design study includes a homogeneous sand dune, and three dunes that each incorporate different protective cores: an armorstone revetment core, a clay levee core, and a concrete T-Wall core. The concepts undergo physical model tests that subject them to conditions that simulate 100 -year storm damage caused by both surge and waves. Dune and beach morphology for each concept is measured through laser profiling techniques, and each concept is evaluated based on calculated erosion and accretion, as well as design considerations including cost. Wave conditions are measured by capacitance gauges at several locations.

40|$|Most {{cardiovascular}} functions exhibit circadian changes. On one hand, predictable-in-time {{differences in}} the physiological status of the cardiovascular system give rise to rhythmic variations in the susceptibility to morbid and mortal events. On the other, the pathological mechanisms of cardiovascular disease exhibit temporal changes in both their manifestation and severity, leading to predictable-in-time {{differences in the}} ability to precipitate the overt expression of disease. It is known that the occurrence of cardiovascular events shows temporal patterns that vary with time. The incidence of potentially life-threatening cardiovascular events, e. g. acute myocardial ischemia and infarction, sudden cardiac death, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and rupture or dissection of aortic aneurysms, displays a diurnal pattern, tending to be higher in the morning. On arousal and the start of daily activities, blood pressure (BP) shows a surge that may last 4 - 6 h. Morning BP surge, together with circadian variations in biochemical and physiological parameters, may be potential triggers for acute cardiovascular events. This may open up potential for applications in medical therapy. It is possible that antihypertensive medication given once daily in the morning may not protect against this surge if its duration of action is too short. Thus, the timing of drug administration or specific drug delivery systems that lead to a greater effect at night and/or mitigate the early morning BP <b>surge</b> may provide <b>protection</b> against cardiovascular events...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{modelling}} and simulation process {{for assessing the}} energy absorption capability of metal oxide varistor (MOV) surge arresters used for lightning protection of wind turbines electrical systems situated in wind farms, when exposed to multiple lightning strokes. A section of an existing wind farm, suitable for lightning transient overvoltage analysis is implemented in the Electromagnetic transients programme-Alternative transients programme (EMTP-ATP) environment and modelled as a test system for analysing the energy absorbed by the medium voltage surge arresters when multiple lightning strokes are terminated {{on one of the}} blade of the wind turbines. Two well-established sets of multiple lightning current parameters are employed in the EMTP-ATP simulations; the natural downward negative multiple lightning strokes recommended by CIGRE TB 549 (2013) and the downward positive multiple lightning strokes recommended by IEC 61400 - 24 - 2010 for lightning protection level one (LPL 1). The results show that the subsequent stroke causes the surge arresters to absorbed less than ten percent additional energy compared to that of the first stroke. This comparative analysis could be found beneficial when designing lightning overvoltage protection system and for selecting the most cost effective and optimal energy absorption capabilities of the surge arresters for the intended wind farms. •EMTP-ATP modelling and simulation of multiple lightning strokes in wind farm. •Multiple lightning strokes terminating on wind turbine blade. •MOV <b>surge</b> arresters provide <b>protection</b> against transient overvoltages in wind farm. •The impact of multiple lightning strokes on the energy absorbed by surge arresters. •The subsequent stroke cause significant voltage stress to wind turbine LV components...|$|R
40|$|The past half−century {{has seen}} a <b>surge</b> in {{consumer}} <b>protection</b> laws designed to give consumers power versus businesses. This dissertation shows how business organizations, namely, automobile manufacturers, shape the content and meaning of consumer protection laws designed to regulate them in ways that transform and at times weaken the rights of consumers. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, I analyze the process through which public legal rights are essentially privatized as manufacturers influence the form and content of consumer warranty legislation (&Idquo;lemon laws”), the nature of administrative regulation, and most importantly, {{the way in which}} consumer complaints are adjudicated. This study compares an instance where powerful state consumer protection laws are resolved in third−party dispute resolution forums created by business organizations and approved by the state (California) with one in which consumer disputes are resolved in public alternative dispute resolution processes run and administered by the state (Vermont). After explaining how two states channeled public legal rights into different institutional structures, I show that the form of the organizational dispute resolution structure influences the meaning of lemon laws in different ways based on competing business and consumer logics operating among public and private actors that adjudicate consumer disputes. Thus, the form of the dispute resolution structure, and how public and private actors construct what lemon laws mean in these structures, has critical implications for the effectiveness of consumer protection laws for consumers. This research has important implications for theory, method, and policy. Theoretically, my study draws upon and elaborates new institutional work in organizational sociology (Edelman 1990, 1992; Edelman, Uggen, & Erlanger 1999; Dobbin et al. 1993; Sutton et al. 1994) and analyses of business influence over legislation and regulation by political scientists (Baumgartner & Jones 1993; Ayres & Braithwaite 1991; Stigler 1971; Bernstein 1955) by offering an institutional−political theory of how private organizations shape the content and meaning of public legal rights. It also contributes to law and society scholarship on dispute resolution in organizations (Galanter & Lande 1992; Edelman & Suchman 1999), studies of the law in action (Macaulay 1963), and access to justice (Felstinger, Abel & Sarat 1980 − 81). In addition to using a wide range of methods (archival analysis, interviewing, participant observation, content analysis, and statistics), I specifically use qualitative methods to examine how law is constructed by an &Idquo;organizational field,” in this case the field of automobile manufacturers, an arena that has previously been studied primarily through quantitative analyses. Whereas quantitative analyses illustrate the macro−dynamics of organizational fields and the diffusion of legal innovations, qualitative methods allow me to identify the micro−processes and mechanisms through which organizations construct the meaning of law. From a policy perspective, my work has critical implications for the growing body of legal scholarship on delegated governance. Whereas much of this scholarship advocates deregulation, public−private partnerships, and organizational self−governance in the context of delivery of services and benefits in society, my analysis sounds a note of caution. At least in the context of adjudicating public legal rights, I show the privatization of dispute resolution by business organizations has potential to undermine the rights of social have−nots...|$|R
