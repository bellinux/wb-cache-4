40|$|We have {{compiled}} a GIS database of faults, earthquakes, engineering geology, slope instability, liquefaction, ground water, dam failure inundation, stream flooding, fire, wind, and subsidence for the County of Riverside. The hazard mapping provides overlays {{on which to}} conduct loss estimations related to existing infrastructure while attempting to minimize risk to new infrastructure. Eight scenario loss estimations associated with segments of the San Andreas, San Jacinto, and Elsinore faults were calculated for Riverside County using HAZUSTM. Input parameters were adjusted based on our GIS database of soil, liquefaction and landslide mapping. The inventory exposure in Riverside County consists of 402, 000 buildings valued at over $ 61 billion, with a population exposure of 1. 2 million. Loss estimations for the eight scenario events varied from 1, 100 to 10, 500 casualties and $ 2. 2 to $ 13. 2 billion. The communicative value of event-specific loss estimation is important in recommending management and mitigation policies for local governments. Hazard mitigation policies are prioritized {{based on the results}} of hazard mapping and loss estimation and implemented through the <b>Safety</b> <b>Element</b> of the new General Plan. The <b>Safety</b> <b>Element</b> is a multi-hazard mitigation tool for land use planning guidance for local governments that can be more restrictive than the State’s Seismic Hazards Mapping Act or the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Hazards Zoning Act.
