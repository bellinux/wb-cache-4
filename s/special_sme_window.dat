40|$|This {{article is}} an attempt to {{contribute}} to the broader debate on growth theory in academic economics on the basis of empirical experience of two decades in transition countries. It analyses whether financial sector reform is urgent and thus should be sequenced from the very outset of transition or, alternatively, is important rather than urgent. If the latter is the case - and in view of the technical sophistication of the task - it should be sequenced later but by no means dodged. The basic questions of the current analysis are that {{there seems to be a}} trade-off between the two, and whether or not underdeveloped financial markets are bound to have an unfavourable impact on long-term growth. We then analyse, one by one, the role of monetary and fiscal institutions, exchange rate and tax regimes, as well as capital markets and <b>special</b> <b>SME</b> agencies across the region. Finally we examine whether the model based on foreign strategic ownership of intermediation is dead after the 2007 - 09 financial meltdown. ...|$|R

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the marketing communication methods used by Namibian clothing and textile SMEs operating from Katutura and Khomasdal Incubation Centres. A quantitative methodological approach was followed in this study. The sample comprised 45 SMEs with business operations at Katutura and Khomasdal Incubation Centres. A simple random sampling method {{was selected as the}} researcher made use of an SME name list provided by the City of Windhoek. A structured questionnaire was used to collect research data. Cross tabulations, correlations and descriptive analyses were used to analyse the research results. The research indicated that the top five most regularly used marketing communication methods are direct sales, „word-of-mouth‟, point-of-sale materials, networking, and newspaper advertisement. The least regularly used marketing communication methods are YouTube, television, direct mail, press releases and coupons/vouchers. Networking was the second most important and effective marketing communication method. Trade shows was the third most-preferred marketing communication method and the reasons advanced were „it gives me the opportunity to talk to and interact with my customers‟. It is recommended that the City of Windhoek should create incentives for current SMEs operating from Katutura and Khomasdal Incubation Centre to leave the incubation centre for new upcoming SMEs. Further research is necessary to establish the reasons why SMEs do not grow as expected and graduate from the incubation centres. Further research is also necessary to determine challenges faced by Namibian SMEs when considering which marketing communication methods to use. The conducted research recommends that different media houses be approached to design and determine special marketing packages for <b>SMEs.</b> <b>Special</b> <b>SME</b> development or advert sections can be negotiated with newspaper outlets.

40|$|Introduction  Globalization {{has opened}} up for opportunities, as well as challenges, for small- and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) to distinguish themselves in a competitive environment. A branding strategy that aims to develop a strong reputation and recognition can be an attempt for Swedish SMEs to create awareness and differentiate themselves in the European market. This thesis is composed of three major bricks; branding, and how the firms exercise it; SMEs resource constraints, in terms of employees and financial assets; and internationalization. All these combined become <b>special</b> challenges for <b>SMEs.</b> Purpose The purpose of this thesis is to examine how Swedish SMEs exercise branding internationally in order to develop a strategic model of how they can continue their brand expansion in the European market. Method In order to fulfill the purpose of the study, a qualitative study based on four Swedish SMEs were included in the sample. Through semi-structured interviews (six face-to-face and one telephone interview). The respondents were the owners, external CEOs, product or marketing managers of the SMEs. The collected data was categorized and each SME was analyzed in order to finally construct a model. Conclusion  The findings in this thesis show that all the investigated SMEs, to different extents, use branding strategies in order to succeed in the international market. Generally the findings conformed to a certain degree to previous findings concerning branding. Further, the importance of international fairs and networking while developing the brands outside the Swedish market was found. The authors came forward with the SME European Brand Expansion-model, which is strongly influenced by the empirical findings in this thesis...|$|R
