40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that ferroelectric memory diodes can be utilized as <b>switching</b> <b>type</b> {{positive temperature coefficient}} (PTC) thermistors. The diode consists of a phase separated blend of a ferroelectric and a semiconducting polymer stacked between two electrodes.

At the Curie temperature the ferroelectric polymer depolarizes and consequently the current density through the semiconductor decreases by orders of magnitude. The diode therefore acts as <b>switching</b> <b>type</b> PTC thermistor. Unlike their inorganic counterparts, the PTC thermistors presented here are thin film devices.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{different}} monetary policy regime <b>switching</b> <b>types</b> impact macroeconomic dynamics. Policy switches that either affect the inflation target or {{the response to}} inflation deviations from target lead to different determinacy regions and different output, inflation, and interest rate distributions. With regime switching, the standard Taylor Principle breaks down in multiple ways; satisfying the Principle period-by-period is neither necessary nor sufficient for determinacy. Switching inflation targets primarily affects the economy’s level, whereas switching inflation responses affects the variance. Even in periods with a fixed monetary policy rule, expectations of future policy switches produce different outcomes depending upon the <b>switching</b> <b>type.</b> Monetary authorities with given inflation objectives need to adjust their policy parameters to counteract expectations of future policy switches...|$|R

A body of research has identified a distributed frontoparietal network of brain regions which contribute to task switching. However, relatively less is known about whether some brain regions may contribute to switching in a domain-general manner while others may be more preferential for different kinds of switching. To explore this issue, we conducted three meta-analyses focusing on different <b>types</b> of task <b>switching</b> frequently used in the literature (perceptual, response, and context switching), and created a conjunction map of these distinct <b>switch</b> <b>types.</b> A total of 36 switching studies with 562 activation coordinates were analyzed using the activation likelihood estimation method. Common areas associated with <b>switching</b> across <b>switch</b> <b>type</b> included the inferior frontal junction and posterior parietal cortex. In contrast, domain-preferential activation was observed for perceptual switching in the dorsal portion of the premotor cortex and for context switching in frontopolar cortex.

40|$|Robust PWM power {{amplifiers}} whose transient re-sponse characteristics do not deteriorate against an extensive load change and/or direct-current power-supply voltage change are needed. A digital robust controller with bumpless mode switching for PWM {{power amplifiers}} which can satisfy such demands has been proposed. In this paper a multi-stage <b>switching</b> <b>type</b> digital controller is proposed for spreading ca-pacitance load range more and improving transient characteristics for inductance load. In the previ-ous proposed controller, {{the configuration of}} the con-troller is the same to all loads. At inductance load, {{there is a possibility that}} the transient characteris-tics may become bad and the specification may not be satisfied. Therefore, a load current is estimated at inductance load, and the controller which also uses load current for feedback is configured. A inductance is estimated and a controller is switched to this con-troller bumplessly. In order to extend the range of capacitance load, a controller is increased from two stage to three stage, and these are switched to each other bumplessly. A DSP is implemented to this dig-ital controller. It is demonstrated from experiments that the multi-stage <b>switching</b> <b>type</b> digital controller is realizable and the given specifications are satisfied...|$|R
