5|$|Cabaniss's {{academic}} rankings remained {{generally the}} same in his following year at the academy. His scores in drawing, mathematics, and physics were above average, while his merits in French language and history were among the worst. He finished 33rd {{in the class of}} 66. He maintained his <b>spot</b> <b>as</b> the most disciplined in his class, earning fewer than half the demerits than the second-best.|$|E
5|$|In 1952 he won {{re-election}} to {{his seat}} in the Oregon House. He also received national attention for his early support for coaxing Dwight D.

5|$|Next year he {{finished}} eleventh at the 2003 World Championships in Paris, {{his first major}} international final. His performance and throw of 77.75metres was slightly disappointing as he had thrown 79.44metres in the qualifying round, having travelled to Paris with a personal best of 85.72 metres, established in June in Ventspils. On the lighter side he took his second national title, consolidating his <b>spot</b> <b>as</b> Norway's leading javelin thrower.|$|E

5|$|After the Chiefs {{acquired}} quarterback Matt Cassel {{from the}} New England Patriots, Croyle entered training camp competing against Tyler Thigpen for a roster <b>spot</b> <b>as</b> backup quarterback. The first depth chart {{in training camp}} listed Croyle as the second quarterback ahead of Thigpen. Croyle entered the Chiefs' first preseason game of 2009 (against the Houston Texans) as the second quarterback and finished as the team's leading passer (12-of-18 for 145 yards) and looked poised throughout the evening to post a 91.2 quarterback rating. The Chiefs {{would go on to}} lose the game 16–10. After quarterback Matt Cassel was injured on August 29 against the Seattle Seahawks, Croyle started the final game of the preseason against the St. Louis Rams.|$|E
5|$|Müller's first Bundesliga goal of {{the season}} came over 2. Bundesliga champions SpVgg Greuther Fürth in Bayern's 3–0 victory on 27 August 2012. On 2 September, he netted a brace as Bayern thrashed {{southern}} rivals VfB Stuttgart, 6–1, in front of 71,000 at the newly expanded Allianz Arena. Müller helped Bayern achieve a record-breaking start to the league season, when he netted a brace over newly promoted Fortuna Düsseldorf on 20 October in their 5–0 victory, recording Bayern's eighth successive win. Three days later, he scored his first Champions League {{goal of the}} season, netting from the penalty <b>spot,</b> <b>as</b> Bayern defeated Lille 1–0 at the French side's newly built Grand Stade Lille Métropole.|$|E

5|$|On Jupiter, cirrus {{clouds are}} {{composed}} of ammonia. When Jupiter's South Equatorial Belt disappeared, one hypothesis put forward by Glenn Orten was that a large quantity of ammonia cirrus clouds had formed above it, hiding it from view. NASA's Cassini probe detected these clouds on Saturn and thin water-ice cirrus on Saturn's moon Titan. Cirrus clouds composed of methane ice exist on Uranus. On Neptune, thin wispy clouds which could possibly be cirrus have been detected over the Great Dark <b>Spot.</b> <b>As</b> on Uranus, these are probably methane crystals.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case {{it may be difficult}} to <b>spot</b> <b>as</b> the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent studies have shown that the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E

Other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds (see animation on the right). Two new, small satellites, Adrastea and Metis, were discovered orbiting just outside the ring, making them the first of Jupiter's moons to be identified by a spacecraft. Athird new satellite, Thebe, was discovered between the orbits of Amalthea andIo.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} later, {{the remains of}} Poe's wife, Virginia, were moved to this <b>spot</b> <b>as</b> well. In 1875, the {{cemetery}} in which she lay was destroyed, {{and she had no}} kin to claim her remains. William Gill, an early Poe biographer, gathered her bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885, the 76th anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly 10 years after his present monument was erected. George W. Spence, the man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial as well as his exhumation and reburial, attended the rites that brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother, Maria Clemm.|$|E
5|$|After Leafs General Manager Pat Quinn {{was unwilling}} to give Joseph a {{four-year}} contract (he offered three years), he left after the 2001–02 season to sign with the Detroit Red Wings. Some also speculated {{that the relationship between}} Quinn and Joseph was frosty because Quinn had benched Joseph in the Salt Lake City Olympics after the first game, although Joseph himself denied the rumours, saying that he played a bad first game against Sweden (losing 5–2) and that Martin Brodeur played very well {{for the rest of the}} tournament, earning his <b>spot</b> <b>as</b> the starter. Joseph had also hinted at wanting to play for a team that could win it all, implying the Leafs were not such a team. Joseph's move to Detroit was highly publicized and unpopular in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{having a}} {{disrupted}} pre-season {{due to his}} participation in Euro 2012, Ben Arfa enjoyed a good start to the new Premier League season. On the opening weekend of the season he won and converted a penalty that gave Newcastle a 2–1 victory over Tottenham. Two weeks later he scored with a spectacular 25-yard drive, on his weaker right foot, to earn Newcastle a point in a 1–1 draw against Aston Villa. He injured his hamstring during December, and made his comeback against Anzhi Makhachkala in the Europa League on 7 March 2013, his 26th birthday. He then developed an injury which {{kept him out of}} the team until the second leg of the Europa League quarter final against Benfica on the 11 April 2013 when he came on as a second-half substitute. Ben Arfa scored the equaliser in a 2–1 away win at Loftus Road from the penalty <b>spot</b> <b>as</b> Newcastle confirmed their Premier League status for the next season.|$|E

5|$|During the afternoon's {{practice}} session on Friday, June 17, 2005, Ralf Schumacher, driving for Toyota, crashed badly in Turn 13 of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course, apparently {{as a result}} of a left-rear tyre failure. He was unable to continue racing, and was replaced by the team's test driver, Ricardo Zonta, for the rest of the weekend. Schumacher had crashed in the same <b>spot</b> <b>as</b> a result of a tyre failure the previous year, while driving for the Williams team. Turn 13 on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course is a high speed banked turn, unique in Formula One racing, which causes a greater than usual tyre loading. On June 18, Michelin reported that it did not understand why the tyres it had provided for its seven customer teams– BAR, McLaren, Red Bull, Renault, Sauber, Toyota, and Williams– had failed in this turn, and announced its intention to fly in tyres of a different specification from its Clermont-Ferrand headquarters. Unfortunately, the replacement tyres flown in, which were of the type used in the Spanish Grand Prix earlier that year, turned out to have the same problem when tested.|$|E
5|$|Fletcher {{graduated}} from the University of Kentucky and joined the United States Air Force to pursue his dream of becoming an astronaut. He left the Air Force after budget cuts reduced his squadron's flying time and {{earned a degree in}} medicine, hoping to earn a <b>spot</b> <b>as</b> a civilian on a space mission. Deteriorating eyesight eventually ended those hopes, and he entered private practice as a physician and conducted services as a Baptist lay minister. He became active in politics and was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1994. Two years later he ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, but lost to incumbent Scotty Baesler. When Baesler retired to run for a seat in the U.S. Senate, Fletcher again ran for the congressional seat and defeated Democratic state senator Ernesto Scorsone. He soon became one of the House Republican caucus' top advisors regarding health care legislation, particularly the Patients' Bill of Rights.|$|E

During their semifinal against Russia, Kariya scored in the shootout to help Canada to a 3–2 win. Advancing to the gold medal game, they lost 4–2 to the Czech Republic. Kariya finished the competition with four goals and seven points over eight games, earning him a <b>spot</b> <b>as</b> Canada's lone representative on the Tournament's First All-Star Team. Over three World Championship appearances, Kariya recorded 28 points (11 goals and 17 assists) over 24 games, which at the time, ranked him at third all-time among Canadian scorers, behind Steve Yzerman's 39 points and Marcel Dionne's 32.|$|E

5|$|Gatski {{was born}} in West Virginia to a coal-mining family. He played for three years on his local high school team before {{attending}} Marshall University, where he continued to play football. He joined the U.S. Army in 1942 and went to fight in World War II. Upon his return in 1945, he finished his collegiate studies at Auburn University in Alabama. After graduating, he tried out and made the roster for the Browns, a team under formation in the new AAFC. He played as a linebacker and backup center {{for most of his}} first two years before earning a <b>spot</b> <b>as</b> the starting center. He retained that position as Cleveland continued to dominate after the AAFC dissolved and the Browns were absorbed by the NFL in 1950. He retired in 1958, never having missed a game or practice in his career.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{became a}} key player in Crewe's bid for {{promotion}} in the 2006–07 season, playing mostly as a midfielder. He made nineteen appearances during the season, scoring three goals – against Swansea City, Nottingham Forest and Yeovil Town. The first two goals came from the penalty <b>spot,</b> <b>as</b> he built his reputation as a solid penalty taker. He also received the first red card of his professional career in October 2006, in a defeat at Bristol City. He was dismissed for violent conduct after a challenge on Louis Carey, though the referee's decision was reported as 'harsh' and 'strange' by the Bristol City website. That red card was the only sending off, and subsequent suspension, of the season for Crewe, as the club was awarded the 'Bobby Moore Fair Play award for outstanding conduct and discipline throughout the season'.|$|E

In the same telecast, Daniels accused Styles of trying to take his <b>spot</b> <b>as</b> the contender for the championship due to Styles having thrown in the towel for Daniels. Styles argued that he was instead looking out for Daniels' health in the storyline. The following week on the January28 episode of Impact!, Zybysko announced that the three would compete in a Three Way match for the title at the show. Joe retained the title at the spectacle.|$|E
