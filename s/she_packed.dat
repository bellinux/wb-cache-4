When {{her room}} was searched later, campus police {{discovered}} {{most of her}} belongings packed in boxes and the art removed from the walls. It's not clear whether Murray packed them that day, but police at the time asserted she'd packed between Sunday night and Monday morning.

Around 3:30 pm, she drove off the campus in her black 1996 Saturn sedan; classes at the university had been canceled that day due to a snowstorm.|$|E

500|$|Dylan {{composed}} {{this song}} {{in the form of}} a 12-bar blues. In the sleeve notes of Freewheelin, Dylan explained to Nat Hentoff: [...] "What made the real blues singers so great is that they were able to state all the problems they had; but at the same time, they were standing outside of them and could look at them. And in that way, they had them beat." [...] Into this song, Dylan injected one explicit mention of an absence that was troubling him: the sojourn of Suze Rotolo in Perugia: [...] "My baby took my heart from me/ <b>She</b> <b>packed</b> it all up in a suitcase/ Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy." ...|$|E

500|$|Ironically, the storyline of {{the film}} was replayed in real life. [...] One of the nonprofessional actresses, a blonde factory worker, had a torrid affair with a {{technician}} who was part {{of the film}} crew. [...] Although the man neglected to tell her that he was married with a child, he promised to send for her when he got back to Prague and set her up in an apartment in the capital city. After waiting {{for a long time to}} hear from him, and telling all her friends that she would shortly be summoned to her love nest, <b>she</b> <b>packed</b> up her belongings and traveled to Prague, only to be spurned in no uncertain terms. The consequence of this situation was grimmer than the denouement of the film; the girl was embarrassed to return home, became a prostitute, went to jail, attempted suicide and finally emigrated to Australia, where there was a shortage of women, especially among Czech emigres.|$|E
500|$|During Casino Night, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) wins {{a game of}} craps {{and kisses}} Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) on the cheek, {{disregarding}} their attempts to keep their intimate relationship a secret.

[...] <b>She</b> <b>packed</b> up the soiled clothes and bedding {{that had been used}} by the men, added disinfectants, and sent it on a steamer bound for Pittsburg Landing to be cleaned by the Chicago Sanitary Commission.

After that, Minnie rethought her {{position}} on a Hollywood career. Accompanied by her mother, Anita joined the film colony in Hollywood where Griffith put Loos on the payroll for Triangle Film Corporation at $75 a week with a bonus for every produced script, perhaps making her the first [...] "staff writer".|$|E

2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{her shift}} in the dining hall, Welden returned {{to her room and}} changed into walking clothes.

Fernandez enjoyed the way she catered to his every whim, and when he learned she had left her children for him, {{he thought it was a}} sign of an unconditional love. He confessed his criminal enterprises to Beck, who quickly sent her children to the Salvation Army in order to assist Fernandez without hindrances. She posed as Fernandez's sister, giving him an air of respectability. Their victims, feeling more secure knowing there was another woman in the house, often agreed to stay with the pair. Beck also convinced some victims that she lived alone and that her [...] "brother" [...] was only a guest. Beck was extremely jealous and would go to great lengths to make sure Fernandez and his [...] "intended" [...] never consummated their relationship. When he did have sex with a woman, Beck subjected both to her violent temper.|$|E
