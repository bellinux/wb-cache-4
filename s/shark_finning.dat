5|$|Sharks {{are often}} killed for shark fin soup. Fishermen capture live sharks, fin them, and dump the finless animal {{back into the}} water. <b>Shark</b> <b>finning</b> {{involves}} removing the fin with a hot metal blade. The resulting immobile shark soon dies from suffocation or predators. Shark fin {{has become a major}} trade within black markets all over the world. Fins sell for about $300/lb in 2009. Poachers illegally fin millions each year. Few governments enforce laws that protect them. In 2010 Hawaii became the first U.S. state to prohibit the possession, sale, trade or distribution of shark fins. From 1996 to 2000, an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting shark fins.|$|E
5|$|The United States manages common {{thresher}} fisheries via regulations such {{as commercial}} quotas and trip limits, and recreational minimum sizes and retention limits. <b>Shark</b> <b>finning</b> is illegal under U.S. federal law. The Atlantic common thresher fishery is {{regulated by the}} National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Highly Migratory Species Management Division through the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP), and the Pacific common thresher fishery is regulated by the Pacific Fishery Management Council through the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS). In the 1990s, after the depletion of common thresher stocks by the California gillnet fishery, the fleet was limited to 70 boats and restrictions were placed on season, operation range, and landings. There {{is evidence that the}} California subpopulation is recovering, and the potential population growth rate has been estimated to be 47% per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{porbeagle}} {{is listed}} on Annex 1 (Highly Migratory Species) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and on Annex 1 of the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS; {{also known as}} the Bonn Convention) Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding. This species benefits from bans on <b>shark</b> <b>finning</b> instituted by several nations and supranational entities, including Canada, the United States, Brazil, Australia, the European Union, and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Although the Animals Committee of the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) recommended additional conservation actions for the porbeagle, CITES rejected proposals to list the species in 2008 and again in 2010. In March 2013, the porbeagle was listed on Appendix II of CITES, allowing for increased regulation in the international trade of this species.|$|E

5000|$|Substitutes for <b>shark</b> <b>fin</b> exist, {{commonly}} known as [...] "mock shark's fin". Mock <b>shark's</b> <b>fin</b> was first used in Hong Kong during the 1970s. From the 1990s onward, mock <b>shark's</b> <b>fin</b> became popular in many restaurants throughout China. Products {{can be made from}} various ingredients.|$|R
5|$|Shark populations began declining. Since {{they are}} predators {{near the top}} of the marine food chain, an {{umbrella}} species, playing an important role in maintaining ocean ecosystems, this could have serious adverse environmental consequences for marine fisheries. Campaigns began in many nations to prohibit or greatly curtail finning in both territorial and international waters and work toward international agreements on the practice. In the U.S., President Bill Clinton signed the <b>Shark</b> <b>Finning</b> Prohibition Act (SFPA) into law in 2000 shortly before leaving office. It amended the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the primary statute regulating fisheries in the U.S.'s Exclusive Economic Zone up to 200 nautical miles offshore, to prohibit finning in U.S. territorial waters by any vessels, and the possession of fins by a U.S.-flagged vessel in international waters or the landing of any fins at a U.S. port without corresponding carcasses amounting to at least 20 times the weight of the fins. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) was charged with promulgating and implementing regulations to enforce the act.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, O'Malley {{signed a}} bill to ban the {{practice}} of <b>shark</b> <b>finning</b> in Maryland, making it the sixth U.S. state to enact this regulation. The signature of this bill made Maryland the first East Coast state to make it illegal to possess, sell, trade or distribute shark fins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Shark</b> <b>finning</b> is a {{worldwide}} issue that involves {{cutting off the}} fins of sharks. This is done while the shark is still alive followed {{by the rest of}} the body being thrown back into the ocean, leaving it to die days after. Used in countries like China and Japan, shark fins are a key ingredient in the world-renowned meal, shark fin soup. The high demand for this particular type of soup has skyrocketed in the last few decades and sells for around $100 on average and is often catered at special occasions such as weddings and banquets. Due to the increased want for these shark fins, traders seek out the fins in order to make a profit. However, the fins are the only part of the shark that fishermen seek out to retrieve due to the low economical value of the actual shark meet. This recently exposed issue along with other overfishing issues has brought upon roughly 80 percent of the shark population decline. It has become prominent concern in marine conservation activism for millions of sharks are killed yearly at an often-unregulated expense.|$|E
25|$|Since TCM recognizes bear bile as a medicinal, {{more than}} 12,000 asiatic black bears {{are held in}} bear farms. The bile is {{extracted}} through a permanent hole in the abdomen leading to the gall bladder, which can cause severe pain. This can lead to bears trying to kill themselves. As of 2012, approximately 10,000 bears are farmed in China for their bile. This practice has spurred public outcry across the country. The bile is collected from live bears via a surgical procedure. The deer penis {{is believed to have}} therapeutic benefits according to traditional Chinese medicine. It is typically very big and, proponents believe, in order to preserve its properties, it should be extracted from a living deer. Medicinal tiger parts from poached animals include tiger penis, believed to improve virility, and tiger eyes. The illegal trade for tiger parts in China has driven the species to near-extinction because of its popularity in traditional medicine. Laws protecting even critically endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger fail to stop the display and sale of these items in open markets. Shark fin soup is traditionally regarded in Chinese medicine as beneficial for health in East Asia, and its status as an elite dish has led to huge demand with the increase of affluence in China, devastating shark populations. The shark fins {{have been a part of}} traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. <b>Shark</b> <b>finning</b> is banned in many countries, but the trade is thriving in Hong Kong and China, where the fins are part of shark fin soup, a dish considered a delicacy, and used in some types of traditional Chinese medicine.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Shark</b> <b>fin</b> soup (or <b>shark's</b> <b>fin</b> soup) is a {{traditional}} soup or stewed item of Chinese cuisine and Vietnamese cuisine, served at special occasions such as weddings and banquets, or as a luxury item in Chinese culture.

50|$|According to WildAid, {{consumption}} of <b>shark</b> <b>fin</b> soup in China {{has dropped by}} 50-70% from 2011 to 2013. China's commerce ministry indicated that {{consumption of}} <b>shark</b> <b>fin</b> soup during the 2013 Spring Break holiday had decreased by 70 percent from 2012, and Hong Kong industry groups reported that <b>shark</b> <b>fin</b> imports were down by 20 to 30 percent from 2012. Also, anecdotal evidence points to a worldwide drop in <b>shark</b> <b>fin</b> prices and a move away from shark fishing in parts of Africa.|$|R
500|$|Intending {{to ban the}} {{practice}} of <b>shark</b> <b>finning</b> while at sea, the United States Congress passed the <b>Shark</b> <b>Finning</b> Prohibition Act in 2000. [...] Two years later the Act saw its first legal challenge in United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins. [...] In 2008 a Federal Appeals Court ruled that a loophole in the law allowed non-fishing vessels to purchase shark fins from fishing vessels while on the high seas. [...] Seeking to close the loophole, the Shark Conservation Act was passed by Congress in December 2010, and it {{was signed into law}} in January 2011.|$|E
500|$|The case {{began in}} 2002 when a Coast Guard crew working from a Navy ship stopped and searched the King Diamond II, a U.S.-flagged, Hong Kong-based vessel in {{international}} waters {{off the coast}} of Guatemala. On board the ship they found shark fins, equivalent to [...] tons ( [...] tonnes) but without any corresponding shark carcasses. The Coast Guard, upon further investigation, found documentary evidence that the KD II had arranged to meet fishing vessels at predetermined locations and buy various quantities of fins. These activities were believed to violate the <b>Shark</b> <b>Finning</b> Prohibition Act of 2000 (SFPA). The fins were thus seized and the ship escorted to San Diego, the nearest American port.|$|E
500|$|While {{the court}} {{recognized}} Congress's intent to curtail and eventually eliminate <b>shark</b> <b>finning</b> by passing the SFPA, [...] "the broad {{purpose of the}} Act provides no help to the government {{with regard to the}} issue on appeal," [...] Reinhardt wrote. He turned finally to the regulations, where he pointed out that Moskowitz had applied the language from the preamble too broadly. [...] "n context, [...] suggests the opposite." [...] Instead of being a case of a vessel with shark fins bound for an American port, the case was instead covered by the regulations on possession, since the KD II was bound for a foreign port, and those provisions were specific to fishing vessels. [...] "Where an agency includes language in one section of the regulation and omits it in another, it is reasonable to presume that the agency acted intentionally in forgoing the language," [...] he wrote, paraphrasing parallel Supreme Court precedent regarding Congressional intent." ...|$|E
5000|$|A Taiwanese manufacturer's {{recipe for}} {{imitation}} <b>shark</b> <b>fin</b> (素翅) contains water, gelatin, alginic acid, sugar, casein, and triolein {{to reproduce the}} chewy, gelatinous texture of <b>shark</b> <b>fins.</b> It is known as suchì in Chinese Mandarin and sou ci in Chinese Cantonese, literally means [...] "vegetarian fin". Konjac gel (known as moyu tofu in Chinese Mandarin, mo wu dau fu in Chinese Cantonese, and konnyaku in Japanese) {{can also be used}} as a substitute for <b>shark</b> <b>fin</b> once it is shredded into thin strands using a grater or food processor. While cellophane noodles are also often used as an alternative to <b>shark</b> <b>fins,</b> some cooks find them too soft and unable to withstand longer cooking that allows flavors to be absorbed. Other substitutes for <b>shark</b> <b>fin</b> are cucurbita ficifolia (<b>shark</b> <b>fin</b> melon), chicken breast, jinhua ham, vermicelli, soy, and pig's skin or gelatin. As with <b>shark</b> <b>fin</b> soups, ingredients such as edible mushrooms, kelps, seaweeds, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and beaten eggs may be used to improve the taste.|$|R

500|$|In {{light of}} recent findings, in 2007, the IUCN reassessed the silky shark from Least Concern to Near Threatened worldwide. Regionally, it {{is listed as}} Near Threatened in the southwestern Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and western central Pacific, and as Vulnerable in the eastern central and southeastern Pacific and the northwestern and western central Atlantic. The silky shark is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, though this has yet to result in any {{management}} schemes. The species should benefit from bans on <b>shark</b> <b>finning,</b> which are being increasingly implemented by nations and supranational entities, including the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Organizations such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas [...] and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission [...] have also taken steps to improve fishery monitoring, with {{the ultimate goal of}} reducing shark bycatch. However, given the highly migratory nature of the silky shark and its association with tuna, no simple way is known to reduce bycatch without also affecting the economics of the fishery.|$|E
500|$|It is {{estimated}} that 100 million sharks are killed by people every year, due to commercial and recreational fishing. <b>Shark</b> <b>finning</b> yields are estimated at 1.44 million metric tons for 2000, and 1.41 million tons for 2010. Based on an analysis of average shark weights, this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000, and about 97 million sharks in 2010, with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year. Sharks are a common seafood in many places, including Japan and Australia. In the Australian state of Victoria, shark is {{the most commonly used}} fish in fish and chips, [...] in which fillets are battered and deep-fried or crumbed and grilled. In fish and chip shops, shark is called flake. In India, small sharks or baby sharks (called sora in Tamil language, Telugu language) are sold in local markets. Since the flesh is not developed, cooking the flesh breaks it into powder, which is then fried in oil and spices (called sora puttu/sora poratu). The soft bones can be easily chewed. They are considered a delicacy in coastal Tamil Nadu. Icelanders ferment Greenland sharks to produce hákarl, which is widely regarded as a national dish. During a four-year period from 1996 to 2000, an estimated 26 to 73 million sharks were killed and traded annually in commercial markets.|$|E
