5|$|Irish {{immigrants}} generally remained {{loyal to}} the Democratic Party, but McKinley's promises of sound money attracted German-Americans who were appalled by Bryan's inflationary proposals. German-Americans had long been Democratic; efforts by that party to rebut McKinley, including circulating a <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> Bismarck in support of bimetallism, were ineffective. Many Catholics and recent immigrants favored McKinley because of the dislike the American Protective Association had for him.|$|E

5|$|Another {{report by}} the UN was {{released}} in October 2011. Interviews with 379 detainees at 47 facilities over the period of a year found “a compelling pattern and practice of systematic torture and ill-treatment” at multiple facilities operated by the ANP and NDS, after 46% of the detainees it spoke with indicated it occurred. A written <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> the Afghan government denied the 'systematic' nature of torture and claimed the report was exaggerated, although it admitted to deficiencies {{due to a lack}} of training and resources. The report also suggested that detainees handed over by the CF received different treatment, with one case citing a man who stated everyone was treated badly unless they were handled by Canadians.|$|E
5|$|Heath, {{who had not}} {{previously}} {{been a member of}} the U.S. national team, won the 100- and 200-meter freestyle events at the 1984 U.S. Olympic trials, and thereby qualified to compete in the two Olympic individual events and for the U.S. relay teams. As a newcomer to the U.S. trials, he made a dramatic <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> setting a new American record in the preliminary heats of the 200-meter freestyle. At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he won three gold medals and a silver.|$|E
5|$|Medical fitness to dive is {{the medical}} and {{physical}} suitability of a diver to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures.

5|$|On 23 August, dos Santos {{complained that}} the U.S. and South African governments {{continued}} to fund UNITA, warning such activity endangered the already fragile ceasefire. The next day Savimbi announced UNITA would no longer abide by the ceasefire, citing Kaunda's insistence that Savimbi leave the country and UNITA disband. The MPLA government responded to Savimbi's <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> moving troops from Cuito Cuanavale, under MPLA control, to UNITA-occupied Mavinga. The ceasefire broke down with dos Santos and the U.S. government blaming {{each other for the}} resumption in armed conflict.|$|E
5|$|The RIRA has {{a command}} {{structure}} {{similar to the}} Provisional IRA, with a seven-member Army Council consisting of a chief of staff, quartermaster general, director of training, director of operations, director of finance, director of publicity, and adjutant general. The rank-and-file members operate in active service units of covert cells to prevent the organisation from being compromised by informers. As of June 2005, the organisation {{is believed to have}} a maximum of about 150 members, according to a <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> the Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell.|$|E

In 1968, the Supreme Court held that the tribe retained its hunting and fishing rights under the treaties involved and the rights were not lost after federal recognition was ended by the Menominee Indian Termination Act without a clear and unequivocal <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> Congress removing the rights.|$|E

5|$|Archimedes {{was born}} c. 287BC in the seaport city of Syracuse, Sicily, {{at that time}} a self-governing colony in Magna Graecia, located {{along the coast of}} Southern Italy. The date of birth is based on a <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> the Byzantine Greek {{historian}} John Tzetzes that Archimedes lived for 75 years. In The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an astronomer about whom nothing is known. Plutarch wrote in his Parallel Lives that Archimedes was related to King Hiero II, the ruler of Syracuse. A biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heracleides but this work has been lost, leaving the details of his life obscure. It is unknown, for instance, whether he ever married or had children. During his youth, Archimedes may have studied in Alexandria, Egypt, where Conon of Samos and Eratosthenes of Cyrene were contemporaries. He referred to Conon of Samos as his friend, while two of his works (The Method of Mechanical Theorems and the Cattle Problem) have introductions addressed to Eratosthenes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1750s, even {{the roof of}} Ardincaple Castle, seat of the clan chief, had fallen in. The overall {{condition}} of the castle had deteriorated {{to such an extent}} that the next laird was forced to abandon it and live in nearby Laggarie. The bulk of the Ardincaple estate ultimately passed into the hands of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll. The last chief of the MacAulays, Aulay MacAulay, died at High Laggarie (now encompassed by the tiny village of Rhu) landless and without an heir to succeed as chief in about 1767. In 1794, Lord Frederick Campbell (brother of John, 5th Duke of Argyll) supervised the draining of the marsh and bog-ridden former lands of the Lairds of Ardincaple. The poor state of the lands of Ardincaple before that year is illustrated in the <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll: that much of the land could not bear the weight of a cow, and local men of the time remembered when horses would be lost in the bogholes prevalent in the area.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him for a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the {{use of nuclear weapons}}. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E

5|$|In 2008 and 2009, {{personnel}} shortages {{reduced the}} number of submarines able to be deployed to three; the maintenance cycles of Sheean, Rankin, and Dechaineux, and problems with Collins and Waller further reducing this to one, Farncomb, in mid-2009. Farncomb was docked for repair after a generator malfunction in February 2010, by which point Collins and Waller were active (the former on limited duties because of defects), and Dechaineux was slated to re-enter service by May 2010. Workforce shortages and malfunctions on other submarines during the preceding two years impacted heavily on the maintenance of Sheean and Rankin, with RAN and ASC officials predicting {{that they will not be}} active until 2012 and 2013, respectively. In June 2011, The Australian newspaper claimed despite two submarines (Waller and Dechaineux) designated as operational, neither was in sailable condition. The initial findings from the Coles Review revealed significant, systemic problems with the submarines and noted the need for their management to be reformed. A 2014 <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> Vice Admiral Ray Griggs indicated that up to four submarines had been operational on most occasions since 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} after the election, members of the Paris 2012 {{delegation}} argued that the London delegation had violated IOC rules. The key points in the accusations were London 2012's abortive athlete incentive initiative and lobbying by then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair. A public <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> IOC President Jacques Rogge dismissed these accusations, stating that the competition had been fair. Another controversy occurred during the bidding process when an undercover investigation by British television series Panorama revealed a corruption scandal associated with IOC member Ivan Slavkov and Olympic agents, who offered to deliver votes from IOC members to any 2012 Olympic bid in return for financial favours. Still recovering {{from the effects of}} the Salt Lake City scandal, the IOC reacted swiftly and punitively toward the rule-breaking individuals.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{his actions}} in leaving Lyon, Ben Arfa {{responded to the}} <b>statement</b> <b>by</b> telling the French sports {{newspaper}} L'Equipe {{that he would not}} be returning to La Commanderie, Marseille's training facility, and would not play with the team for the remainder of the season. He also stated that his relationship with Deschamps had turned sour and was beyond repair. Ben Arfa confirmed his intentions by travelling to Newcastle upon Tyne, without authorization, with hopes that Newcastle and Marseille would come to an agreement. After returning to Marseille, he missed several training sessions with his parent club and was, subsequently, left off the match day squad for two league matches against Valenciennes and Lorient. Ben Arfa's number 10 was later given to new signing André-Pierre Gignac, which signaled a transfer was imminent.|$|E
