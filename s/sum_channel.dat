50|$|FDM {{can also}} be used to combine signals before final {{modulation}} onto a carrier wave. In this case the carrier signals are referred to as subcarriers: an example is stereo FM transmission, where a 38 kHz subcarrier is used to separate the left-right difference signal from the central left-right <b>sum</b> <b>channel,</b> prior to the frequency modulation of the composite signal.An analog NTSC television channel is divided into subcarrier frequencies for video, color, and audio.DSL uses different frequencies for voice and for upstream and downstream data transmission on the same conductors, which is also an example of frequency duplex. Where frequency-division multiplexing is used as to allow multiple users to share a physical communications channel, it is called frequency-division multiple access (FDMA).|$|E
50|$|To combat these effects, {{side lobe}} {{suppression}} (SLS) is used. SLS employs a third pulse, P2, spaced 2μs after P1. This pulse {{is transmitted from}} the omnidirectional antenna (or the antenna difference channel) by the ground station, {{rather than from the}} directional antenna (or the <b>sum</b> <b>channel).</b> The power output from the omnidirectional antenna is calibrated so that, when received by an aircraft, the P2 pulse is stronger than either P1 or P3, except when the directional antenna is pointing directly at the aircraft. By comparing the relative strengths of P2 and P1, airborne transponders can determine whether or not the antenna is pointing at the aircraft when the interrogation was received. The power to the difference antenna pattern (for systems so equipped) is not adjusted from that of the P1 and P3 pulses. Algorithms are used in the ground receivers to delete replies {{on the edge of the}} two beam patterns.|$|E

Now we extend this concept to monopulse radar for target angle estimation using <b>sum</b> and difference <b>channels.</b> For estimating target elevation and azimuthal coordinates, <b>sum</b> and difference <b>channels</b> are required for vertical and horizontal directions. Implementation of a fully adaptive system with <b>sum</b> and difference <b>channels</b> in both polarizations is problematic from a data bandwidth and computational point of view.

However, as the overloading factor β increases, the sum capacity of Tanaka and Guo-Verdu approach the upper bound and the lower and upper bounds become tighter. Another important conclusion is that for small to medium scale systems, asymptotic values of Tanaka and Guo-Verdu cannot be used for the estimation of the <b>sum</b> <b>channel</b> capacity, and therefore, we have to use the lower and upper bounds introduced.|$|E

The Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are used to search the optimum signature matrices based on these three measures (<b>Sum</b> <b>channel</b> capacity, BER and Distance). Since the GA and PSO algorithms become computationally expensive for large signature matrices, we propose suboptimal large signature matrices that can be derived from small sub-optimal matrices.
