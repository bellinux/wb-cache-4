40|$|Issues of {{selection}} of spatial geometric form of <b>streamline</b> <b>bodies</b> of sensing elements in hydrodynamic liquid flow measuring transducers were discussed basing on proposed integrated criterion of estimation. This criterion is grounded on effective interaction of measuring flow with transducer sensing element and gives high {{sensitivity of the}} system along with measuring accuracy at minimum impact on kinematic flow characteristics. Design objectives of form of <b>streamline</b> <b>bodies</b> of sensing elements in hydrodynamic liquid flow measuring transducers, their geometric forms and spatial arrangement regarding incoming flow have been determined. Main classes of <b>streamline</b> <b>bodies</b> which are used in flowmeters were investigated. Rational geometric forms of mentioned bodies and their spatial arrangement relatively to flow velocity vector, which create real background of synthesis of hydrodynamic flow measuring transducers with improved performance were analyzed. ??????????? ??????? ?????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ????? ??? ????????? ?????????????? ????????? ????????????? ???????????????? ??????? ???????? ?????????????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ????????????? ??????????? ???????? ??????, ???????????? ?? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ?????????? ????? ? ?????????????? ????????? ???????????????, ?????????????? ??????? ???????????????? ??????? ? ???????? ????????? ??? ??????????? ??????? ?? ?????????????? ?????????????? ??????. ?????????? ????????? ????????? ????? ??? ????????? ?????????????? ????????? ????????????????? ????????????????, ?? ?????????????? ????? ? ???????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????. ??????????? ??????? ?????? ??? ????????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ? ???????? ???????????? ?? ?????????????? ????? ?? ???????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????? ????????? ???????, ??????? ??????? ???????? ??????????? ??????? ????????????????? ????????????? ???????????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ???????????????? ????????????????...|$|R

50|$|Hyphydrus loriae {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 30 - 31 mm. Pronotum and elytra are blackish, while legs and {{antennae}} are reddish. These water beetles have oval, flattened and <b>streamlined</b> <b>bodies</b> adapted for aquatic life.|$|R
50|$|Akera is a {{primitive}} genus. These sea hares {{do not fit}} completely in their external shell; it just covers their visceral hump which is positioned at the posterior end of their <b>bodies.</b> Their <b>streamlined</b> <b>bodies</b> are adapted for burrowing.|$|R
5|$|The Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezii) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, {{belonging}} to the family Carcharhinidae. It {{is found in the}} tropical waters of the western Atlantic Ocean from Florida to Brazil, and is the most commonly encountered reef shark in the Caribbean Sea. With a robust, <b>streamlined</b> <b>body</b> typical of the requiem sharks, this species is difficult to tell apart from other large members of its family such as the dusky shark (C. obscurus) and the silky shark (C. falciformis). Distinguishing characteristics include dusky-colored fins without prominent markings, a short free rear tip on the second dorsal fin, and tooth shape and number.|$|E
5|$|The blacknose shark has a slender, <b>streamlined</b> <b>body</b> with a long, rounded snout {{and large}} eyes. There is a {{well-developed}} flap of skin {{in front of}} each nostril, defining the inflow and outflow openings. Twelve to 13 and 11 to 12 tooth rows occur {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively, with one or two teeth at the symphysis (middle). The teeth are triangular and oblique, with serrated edges; the upper teeth are stouter than the lower teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, measuring less a third the length of the first dorsal fin base.|$|E
5|$|Most fish move by {{alternately}} contracting paired sets {{of muscles}} {{on either side}} of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The <b>streamlined</b> <b>body</b> of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.|$|E
25|$|Airships {{and some}} bodies of {{revolution}} use the volumetric drag coefficient, {{in which the}} reference area is {{the square of the}} cube root of the airship volume (volume to the two-thirds power). Submerged <b>streamlined</b> <b>bodies</b> use the wetted surface area.|$|R
50|$|Hydrophilus caschmirensis is {{dark brown}} or black. These beetles have <b>streamlined</b> <b>bodies</b> and heads adapted for aquatic life. The hindlegs are fringed with stiff hair useful in {{propelling}} this insect in the water. They gets oxygen {{from the air}} periodically visiting the surface. They feed on decaying vegetable matter.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s America's motor {{industry}} saw {{a time of}} innovation and revolutionary car designs. Car designs emerged with styling cues such as fins and <b>streamline</b> <b>bodies</b> derived from various jets, rockets and other aircraft. Plymouth, in contrast to its competitors, valued engineering supremacy more than visual appeal.|$|R
5|$|Sirenians first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Early Eocene and significantly diversified throughout the epoch. They inhabited rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine waters. Sirenians, unlike other marine mammals such as cetaceans, lived in the New World. The earliest aquatic sirenian discovered is Prorastomus which dates back to 40 million years ago, and the first known sirenian, the quadruped Pezosiren, lived 50 million years ago. Prorastomidae and Protosirenidae, the earliest sirenian families, consisted of pig-like amphibious creatures who died {{out at the end of}} the Eocene. When the Dugongidae appeared at this time, sirenians had evolved the characteristics of modern variety, including an aquatic <b>streamlined</b> <b>body</b> with flipper-like front legs with no hind limbs, and a powerful tail with horizontal caudal fins which uses an up-and-down motion to move them through the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{copper shark}} has a slender, <b>streamlined</b> <b>body</b> with a {{slightly}} arched profile just behind the head. The snout is rather long and pointed, with the nostrils preceded by low flaps of skin. The round, moderately large eyes are equipped with nictating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth has short, subtle furrows at the corners and contains 29–35 upper tooth rows and 29–33 lower tooth rows. The teeth are serrated with single narrow cusps; the upper teeth have a distinctive hooked shape and become more angled towards {{the corners of the}} jaw, while the lower teeth are upright. The upper teeth of adult males are longer, narrower, more curved, and more finely serrated than those of adult females and juveniles. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly long.|$|E
5|$|The {{dusky shark}} (Carcharhinus obscurus) is {{a species of}} requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, {{occurring}} in tropical and warm-temperate continental seas worldwide. A generalist apex predator, the dusky shark can be found from the coast to the outer continental shelf and adjacent pelagic waters, and has been recorded from a depth of 400 m (1,300ft). Populations migrate seasonally towards the poles {{in the summer and}} towards the equator in the winter, traveling hundreds to thousands of kilometers. One of the largest members of its genus, the dusky shark reaches 4.2m (14ft) in length and 347kg (765lb) in weight. It has a slender, <b>streamlined</b> <b>body</b> and can be identified by its short round snout, long sickle-shaped pectoral fins, ridge {{between the first and second}} dorsal fins, and faintly marked fins.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made in}} the Langley 300 -mph 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of a refined deep-step planing-tail hull with various forebody and afterbody shapes and, for comparison, a <b>streamline</b> <b>body</b> simulating the fuselage of a modern transport airplane. The results of the tests indicated that the configurations incorporating a forebody with a length-beam ratio of 7 had lower minimum drag coefficients than the configurations incorporating a forebody with length-beam ratio of 5. The lowest minimum drag coefficients, which were considerably less than that of a conventional hull and slightly less than that of a <b>streamline</b> <b>body,</b> were obtained on the length-beam-ratio- 7 forebody, alone and with round center boom. Drag coefficients and longitudinal- and lateral-stability parameters presented include the interference of a 21 -percent-thick support wing...|$|R
50|$|Phocids {{are more}} {{specialized}} for aquatic life than otariids. They lack external ears and have sleek, <b>streamlined</b> <b>bodies.</b> Retractable nipples, internal testicles, and an internal penile sheath provide further streamlining. A smooth layer of blubber lies underneath the skin. Phocids {{are able to}} divert blood flow to this layer to help control their temperatures.|$|R
25|$|Some {{dolphins}} are {{adapted for}} diving to great depths. In {{addition to their}} <b>streamlined</b> <b>bodies,</b> some can slow their heart rate to conserve oxygen. Some can also re-route blood from tissue tolerant of water pressure to the heart, brain and other organs. Their hemoglobin and myoglobin store oxygen in body tissues and they have twice the concentration of myoglobin than hemoglobin.|$|R
5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a <b>streamlined</b> <b>body.</b> They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E
5|$|Whales are {{descendants}} of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). They {{are related to}} the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago. Primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic 5–10 million years later. What defines an archaeocete is the presence of anatomical features exclusive to cetaceans, alongside other primitive features not found in modern cetaceans, such as visible legs or asymmetrical teeth. Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes included their hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone (Ambulocetus 49 mya), a <b>streamlined</b> <b>body</b> and the growth of flukes on the tail (Protocetus 43 mya), the migration of the nostrils toward the top of the cranium (blowholes), and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers (Basilosaurus 35 mya), and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs (the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 mya).|$|E
25|$|A <b>streamlined</b> <b>body</b> {{looks like}} a fish (Tuna, Oropesa, etc.) or an airfoil with small angle of attack, whereas a blunt body {{looks like a}} brick, a {{cylinder}} or an airfoil with high angle of attack. For a given frontal area and velocity, a <b>streamlined</b> <b>body</b> will have lower resistance than a blunt body. Cylinders and spheres are taken as blunt bodies because the drag {{is dominated by the}} pressure component in the wake region at high Reynolds number.|$|E
50|$|Megadytes glaucus {{can reach}} {{a length of}} about 30 mm. The basic color {{of the body is}} dark shiny. These beetles have oval, {{flattened}} <b>streamlined</b> <b>bodies</b> adapted for aquatic life. As they live in water, they have to surface for air and carry a bubble of air under their elytra. The hindlegs are adapted for propelling this insect in the water.|$|R

25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{design of}} cars {{has evolved from}} the 1920s {{to the end of}} the 20th century. This change in design from a blunt body to a more <b>streamlined</b> <b>body</b> reduced the drag coefficient from about 0.95 to 0.30.|$|E
25|$|For a <b>streamlined</b> <b>body</b> {{to achieve}} a low drag coefficient, the {{boundary}} layer around the body must remain attached {{to the surface of}} the body for as long as possible, causing the wake to be narrow. A high form drag results in a broad wake. The boundary layer will transition from laminar to turbulent if Reynolds number of the flow around the body is sufficiently great. Larger velocities, larger objects, and lower viscosities contribute to larger Reynolds numbers.|$|E
25|$|The {{swallows}} and martins have an evolutionarily conservative {{body shape}} which is similar across the clade but is unlike that of other passerines. Swallows have adapted to hunting insects on the wing by developing a slender, <b>streamlined</b> <b>body</b> and long pointed wings, which allow great maneuverability and endurance, as well as frequent periods of gliding. Their body shape allows for very efficient flight; the metabolic rate of swallows in flight is 49–72% lower than equivalent passerines of the same size.|$|E
50|$|All {{species of}} Xenopus have flattened, {{somewhat}} egg-shaped and <b>streamlined</b> <b>bodies,</b> and very slippery skin (because of a protective mucus covering). The frog's skin is smooth, {{but with a}} lateral line sensory organ that has a stitch-like appearance. The frogs are all excellent swimmers and have powerful, fully webbed toes, though the fingers lack webbing. Three of the toes on each foot have conspicuous black claws.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{stall and}} its {{consequences}} which are important to aircraft design and operation are discussed. A certain degree of unsteadyness always accompanies the flow over <b>streamlined</b> <b>bodies</b> at high angle of attack, however, the stall of lifting surface undergoing unsteady motion {{is more complex than}} static stall. Dynamic stall remains a major unsolved problem with a variety of applications in aeronautics, hydrodynamics and wind engineering...|$|R
50|$|Meladema coriacea {{can reach}} {{a length of}} about 20 - 22 mm. The color {{of the body is}} shiny black. These water beetles have oval, {{flattened}} <b>streamlined</b> <b>bodies</b> adapted for aquatic life. Elytra have short curved striae. Antennae are reddish, and the legs are brown. The hindlegs are adapted for propelling this insect in the water. Adults can be found from April to September.|$|R
