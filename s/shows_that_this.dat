5|$|Quantification of the {{proportion}} of barbarian-born troops in the 4th-century army is highly speculative. Elton has undertaken the most {{detailed analysis of the}} meagre evidence. According to this analysis, {{about a quarter of the}} sample of army officers was barbarian-born in the period 350–400. Analysis by decade <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> proportion did not increase over the period, or indeed in the early 5th century. The latter trend implies that {{the proportion}} of barbarians in the lower ranks was not much greater, otherwise {{the proportion of}} barbarian officers would have increased over time to reflect that.|$|E
5|$|The Chicxulub Crater lends {{support to}} the theory {{postulated}} by the late physicist Luis Alvarez and his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, that the extinction of numerous animal and plant groups, including non-avian dinosaurs, may have resulted from a bolide impact (the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event). Luis and Walter Alvarez, at the time both faculty members at the University of California, Berkeley, postulated that this enormous extinction event, which was roughly contemporaneous with the postulated date of formation for the Chicxulub crater, could {{have been caused by}} just such a large impact. The age of the rocks marked by the impact <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago, the end of the Cretaceous period, and the start of the Paleogene period. It coincides with the K–Pg boundary, the geological boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene. The impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, including the worldwide extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. This conclusion has been the source of controversy. In March 2010, 41 experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence: 20 years' worth of data spanning a variety of fields. They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions at the K–Pg boundary. In 2013 a study compared isotopes in impact glass from the Chicxulub impact with the same isotopes in ash from the boundary where the extinction event occurred in the fossil record; the study concluded that the impact glasses were dated at 66.038 ± 0.049 Ma, and the deposits immediately above the discontinuity in the geological and fossil record was dated to 66.019 ± 0.021 Ma, the two dates being within 19,000 years of each other, or almost exactly the same within experimental error. The theory is now widely accepted by the scientific community. Some critics, including paleontologist Robert Bakker, argue that such an impact would have killed frogs as well as dinosaurs, yet the frogs survived the extinction event. Gerta Keller of Princeton University argues that recent core samples from Chicxulub prove the impact occurred about 300,000 years before the mass extinction, and thus could not have been the causal factor. However, this conclusion is unsupported by radioactive dating and sedimentology.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the apparent variations in marine biodiversity may actually be an artifact, with abundance estimates directly related to quantity of rock available for sampling from different time periods. However, statistical analysis <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> can only account for 50% of the observed pattern, and other evidence (such as fungal spikes) provides reassurance that most widely accepted extinction events are real. A quantification of the rock exposure of Western Europe indicates that many of the minor events for which a biological explanation has been sought are most readily explained by sampling bias.|$|E
25|$|Heterojunction {{transistors}} {{have different}} semiconductors for {{the elements of}} the transistor. Usually the emitter is composed of a larger bandgap material than the base. The figure <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> difference in bandgap allows the barrier for holes to inject backward from the base into the emitter, denoted in the figure as Δφp, to be made large, while the barrier for electrons to inject into the base Δφn is made low. This barrier arrangement helps reduce minority carrier injection from the base when the emitter-base junction is under forward bias, and thus reduces base current and increases emitter injection efficiency.|$|E

25|$|As Paul Erdős observed, the Sylvester–Gallai theorem {{immediately}} {{implies that}} any set of n points {{that are not}} collinear determines at least n different lines.

25|$|The {{theory for}} this kind of {{avalanche}} transistor is described completely in the paper , which also <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> semiconductor device structure is well suited for microwave power amplification. It can deliver several watts of radio frequency power at a frequency of several gigahertz and it also has a control terminal, the base. However, it is not widely used since it requires voltages exceeding 200 volts to work properly, while gallium arsenide or other compound semiconductor FETs deliver a similar performance while being easier to work with. A similar device structure, proposed more or less in the same period in the paper , was the IMPISTOR, being a transistor with IMPATT collector-base junction.|$|E
25|$|Motivation may {{contribute}} to the placebo effect. The active goals of an individual changes their somatic experience by altering the detection and interpretation of expectation-congruent symptoms, and by changing the behavioral strategies a person pursues. Motivation may link to the meaning through which people experience illness and treatment. Such meaning is derived from the culture in which they live and which informs them about the nature of illness and how it responds to treatment. Research into the placebo treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> varies widely with society. The placebo effect in treating gastric ulcers is low in Brazil, higher in northern Europe (Denmark, Netherlands), and extremely high in Germany. However, the placebo effect in treating hypertension is lower in Germany than elsewhere.|$|E
