A novel catalyst support (LiF) is reported {{for the first time}} as an alternative for large-scale production of carbon nanofibers while purification process of nanofibers is easier. In our experiment, the <b>sealed</b> <b>furnace</b> was heated at 700 ∘C for 0. 5 hour (the heating rate was 10 ∘C/min) and then cooled to room temperature in the furnace naturally. Catalytic chemical vapor deposition is of interest for fundamental understanding and improvement of commercial synthesis of carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The obtained sample was sequentially washed with ethanol, dilutes acid, and distilled water to remove residual impurities, amorphous carbon materials, and remaining of catalyst, and then dried at 110 ∘C for 24 hours. The combined physical characterization through several techniques, such as high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), thermogarvimetric analysis (TGA), and zeta-sizer and Raman spectroscopy, allows determining the geometric characteristic and the microstructure of individual carbon nanofibers. Catalytic chemical vapor deposition is of interest for fundamental understanding and improvement of commercial synthesis of carbon nanofibers (CNFs).

40|$|High carbon {{ferrochromium}} {{is produced}} by carbon reduction. No replacement for carbon as reductant has yet been developed. The reduction creates {{a considerable amount of}} CO-gas. In open and semi-closed furnaces the gas is burned when leaving the burden. In closed furnaces the formed gas is sucked out by a fan, washed and utilised as fuel. The formation of carbon monoxide is presented briefly starting from thermodynamic considerations up to solid and liquid state reduction. The volume, composition and energy content of the furnace gas are discussed, focusing on the raw materials and pre-treatment processes of the furnace feed {{as well as on the}} process equipment and control. Outokumpu has been using closed and <b>sealed</b> <b>furnaces</b> and utilising the CO-gas in its Tornio Ferrochrome Works since 1968. Today in Tornio with an annual ferrochromium production of 260 000 t CO-gas production is 186 million m 3, representing 68 MWh an hour. At the same time the furnace power input is 95 MW. About 98 % of the CO-gas is utilised, whereof 30 % in the ferrochrome production itself. This paper focuses on the characteristics and utilisation of CO-gas. CO-gas is secondary energy, which on one hand saves primary electric and fossil fuel energy in ferrochromium production and, on the other, replaces other fossil fuels at the adjacent steel works. The characteristics of the fuel, requirements for utilisation as well as health and safety aspects are discussed.

Microstructures were investigated using microscopy coupled with analyzing software and a scanning electron microscopy. The specific wear of samples was tested using pin-on-disc wear testing machine. X-ray diffraction was performed to calculate the amount of retained austenite present in the ausferrite matrix. As cast microstructure consists of ferrite and pearlite, whereas ADI contains a mixture of acicular ferrite and carbon enriched austenite called “ausferrite”. Hardness and strength decreased, whereas ductility and impact strength improved with increase in austempering temperature.

500|$|There are {{different}} ways in which the raw materials are charged into the blast furnace. Some blast furnaces use a [...] "double bell" [...] system where two [...] "bells" [...] are used to control the entry of raw material into the blast furnace. The purpose of the two bells is to minimize the loss of hot gases in the blast furnace. First, the raw materials are emptied into the upper or small bell which then opens to empty the charge into the large bell. The small bell then closes, to <b>seal</b> the blast <b>furnace,</b> while the large bell rotates to provide specific distribution of materials before dispensing the charge into the blast furnace. A more recent design is to use a [...] "bell-less" [...] system. These systems use multiple hoppers to contain each raw material, which is then discharged into the blast furnace through valves. These valves are more accurate at controlling how much of each constituent is added, as compared to the skip or conveyor system, thereby increasing the efficiency of the furnace. Some of these bell-less systems also implement a discharge chute in the throat of the furnace (as with the Paul Wurth top) in order to precisely control where the charge is placed.|$|R
40|$|Aspects {{of early}} Greek {{extractive}} iron metallurgy are investigated here, {{for the first}} time, with particular emphasis on Macedonia, Greece's most metals-rich province. The subject is approached experimentally by considering equally the ores, slag and artefacts of iron in Macedonia, through the analytical examination of archaeological slag and artefacts, the experimental smelting of Macedonian ores and subsequent analytical investigation of the slag and blooms produced. The mineral resources geology of Macedonia is presented. The historical background to mining and metal working in Macedonia from the Early Iron Age (tenth century BC) to {{the turn of the}} present century is documented. The literature on the introduction of iron into Greece, and the East Mediterranean more generally, is critically reviewed, and in the light of results obtained, especially from Thasos, it is argued that the origins of iron making in Macedonia, if not elsewhere in Greece, should be sought locally during the Late Bronze Age. Despite the absence of excavated furnace remains, it has been possible, through analytical examination of metallurgical waste, to trace the operation of the bloomery in Macedonia continuously for nearly thirty centuries. That a considerable variety of iron ores were exploited was elucidated by the analysis of slag inclusions in a large number of iron artefacts from Vergina and from sites on Thasos and the East Macedonian Mainland, spanning chronologically the Early Iron Age to the Byzantine period. The titanium-rich magnetite sands on Thasos and at Vrontou on the Mainland were shown to have been worked from the Hellenistic/Roman to the turn of this century. A second century BC nickel-rich bloom found at the Hellenistic site at Petres in West Macedonia testified, for the first time, to the smelting of nickel-rich iron laterites in Greece, while the manganese-rich iron deposits in Palaia Kavala district were worked for their precious metals content, probably during Ottoman times and perhaps as early as the Classical period. It is suggested that the Skapte Hyle of the classical texts may be located in the Palaia Kavala district. A fresh appraisal of the depiction of furnaces on Black and Red Figure Attic vases of the sixth and fifth centuries BC suggests that the bloomery process may have developed at that time to a level not previously suspected. The classical texts, the function of the cauldron on the furnace top and experimental meltings carried out in the process of this work all point to the production of wrought iron/steel through the decarburisation of high carbon iron in a fining hearth. It is argued that the furnaces depicted on the vases are themselves fining hearths, the cauldron <b>sealing</b> the <b>furnace</b> top in order for the air blast to be directed over the molten mass...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study was}} done on the synthesis and superconducting properties of metal rich transition metal borides. Five different binary systems were investigated including the boride systems of niobium, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten and rhenium. High temperature solid state methods were used in order to synthesize samples of different transition metal borides of the composition M 2 B, MB, M 3 B 2, MB 2, and M 2 B 4. The reactions were carried out in three different furnaces with different sample containers: the electric arc (copper crucible), the {{high frequency induction furnace}} (boron nitride, tantalum or glassy carbon crucibles), and the conventional tube <b>furnace</b> (<b>sealed</b> evacuated quartz ampoules). The products obtained were characterized with X-ray powder diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Phase analyses and crystal structure refinements using the Rietveld method and based on structure models known from literature were performed. A neutron diffraction measurement was done for W 2 B 4 to allow for a complete crystal structure determination, {{because of the presence of}} a heavy element like tungsten and a light element like boron that made it difficult to determine the accurate determination of the boron atom positions and occupancies from X-ray data. A new structure model for W 2 B 4 was proposed. Magnetic measurements in a SQUID magnetometer down to temperatures as low as 1. 8 K were performed to several of the products in order to see if the transition metal borides become superconducting at low temperatures, and the results were compared with data from literature.

40|$|The {{task of the}} {{research}} and development project was to lower the PCDD and PCDF emissions from secondary aluminium smelting by the development of new and improved processes. The processes under consideration were situated in the primary path (firing and smelting) {{as well as in the}} secondary path (waste gas processing). As a primary measure, the influence of oxygen was analysed. The oxygen was loaded by an oxygen lance which was installed in the rotary furnace opposite to the burner. In alternative, the burner was driven with natural gas-air and with natural gas-oxygen. In the secondary path, the project comprised the examination of a double-stage-filter in which hydrated lime as well as hydrated lime and mixtures of lime and powdered brown coal coke were applied as sorption agents. Further examinations referred to a single-stage filter in which mixtures of lime and coal were tested as well, partly with recirculation. The most important results were: - A potential in the diminution of PCDD/PCDF emissions can't be derived from the use of oxygen burners. There is a tendency towards a deterioration of the PCDD/PCDF emissions. - The application of the oxygen burners led to a considerable higher emission of nitrogen oxides. In order to obtain an improvement in this field, a correction in the design of the <b>furnace</b> <b>seal</b> on the side of the burner would be necessary. - An oxygen lance could reduce the load to total organic carbon (TOC). However, the required control technique is not yet available. - A double-stage filter improves the separation of dust and consequently of PCDD/PCDF. Furthermore, the application of brown coal coke considerably increases the separation of PCDD/PCDF. - Also single-stage filter shows a similar good purification effect if lime/coke mixtures with recirculation are used as sorption agents. The application of a filter medium made of Gore-Tex caused an increased separation of finest dust, but it didn't result in a considerable improvement of the PCDD/PCDF emissions. (orig.)

40|$|MSc (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 An {{electric}} arc furnace makes use of electrical {{energy in the form}} of an arc to heat charged material. In the ferromanganese smelting process the ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3) and manganese oxide (MnO 2) are reduced with coke. The basic reaction that takes place is described in the following equation Fe 203 + 2 Mn 02 + 7 C	 = 2 FeMn + 	 7 C 0 The high quantity of carbon monoxide (CO) produced in the process, which has a significantly high calorific value, can be used to generate energy to supplement certain areas of the process. Due to the moisture in the charged material, electrolysis takes place within the furnace, generating hydrogen (H 2) and oxygen (O 2). The high temperature allows a percentage of the carbon monoxide to combust instantly with the available oxygen, which forms carbon dioxide (CO 2). The balance of gas in the process is primarily nitrogen (N 2), which comes from the air drawn into the furnace, as it is impossible to <b>seal</b> the <b>furnace</b> off perfectly. The oxygen from the air also combusts with the carbon monoxide, however there is always a small percentage of oxygen that does not combust. The following table indicates the percentiles of the different gas compositions within the furnace Gas Composition Percentage (Typical) Percentage (Range) Carbon Monoxide 51. 0 % 50. 0 - 65. 0 % Carbon Dioxide 13. 0 % 10. 0 - 20. 0 % Nitrogen 25. 0 % 20. 0 - 28. 0 % Hydrogen 8. 30 % 7. 50 - 12. 0 % Oxygen 2. 00 % 0. 50 - 3. 50 % Methane 0. 70 % 0. 40 - 0. 80 % Table 1 : Typical gas composition percentages The power input into the furnace process to induce the reduction of the ferric- and manganese oxide, determines the rate at which the reaction takes place. The power input is most commonly measured in MVA and then multiplied by the furnace power factor, which is a function of the electrode characteristics as an inductor, to convert to MW. The rate at which off-gas is generated does not change significantly with the change in power input, however the dust load in the off-gas stream changes exponentially. Larger particulate is generated with the increase in power, as well as the total mass of dust per cubic meter of gas. The dust loading of the off-gas plays a critical role in the design of an off-gas scrubbing system. The following table indicates the increase in dust load with the increase of power input into the furnace. Power Input [MVA] Dust Emission Rate [μg/s] 30 1082. 877 40 2793. 574 50 7206. 776 60 18591. 82 70 47962. 61 Table 2 : Dust emission rate as a function of furnace power Another critical factor of the scrubbing system design is particle size distribution (PSD). The maximum emission of a plant is dictated by environmental legislation, and needs to be adhered to. The greater the dust load in the gas stream, the more efficient the scrubbing system needs to be, because small particulate, which are particles with a sub-micron aerodynamic diameter, is more difficult to remove from a gas stream. The greater the dust load per cubic meter, the greater the quantity of the sub-micron particulate, which significantly influences the design of the scrubber. The required increase in efficiency exponentially increases the power consumption of the scrubbing system, which greatly increases supply costs and service requirements of the plant. The following table indicates the particle size distributions Particle Size [μm] Percentage [Typical] < 1. 00 20. 0 % 1. 00 - 5. 00 40. 0 % 5. 00 - 10. 0 20. 0 % 10. 0 - 100. 0 15. 0 % 50. 0 - 100. 0 4. 00 % 100. 0 - 500. 0 1. 00 % Table 3 : Particle size distribution at 40 MW furnace load These parameters are paramount when conducting the front-end engineering of a scrubbing system for this application. Not only are there financial and commercial implications when failing to adhere to acceptable emissions, but the impact on the surrounding environment can detrimental.
