25|$|Baum's {{newspaper}} {{failed in}} 1891, and he, Maud, and their four sons {{moved to the}} Humboldt Park section of Chicago, where Baum took a job reporting for the Evening Post. Beginning in 1897, he founded and edited a magazine called The <b>Show</b> <b>Window,</b> later known as the Merchants Record and <b>Show</b> <b>Window,</b> which focused on store window displays, retail strategies and visual merchandising. The major department stores of the time created elaborate Christmastime fantasies, using clockwork mechanisms that made people and animals appear to move. The former <b>Show</b> <b>Window</b> magazine is still currently in operation, now known as VMSD magazine (visual merchandising + store design), based in Cincinnati. In 1900, Baum published a book about window displays in which he {{stressed the importance of}} mannequins in drawing customers. He also had to work as a traveling salesman.|$|E

This test was undertaken at ground level, with zero pressure differential between the cabin and the surrounding environment. This was claimed to {{have no effect on}} the overall result of the test, which aimed to simulate the explosion at [...] It was not demonstrated what would happen at a typical cruising altitude of between [...] and , where the pressure differential would have caused the fuselage to be under a far greater stress than at ground level.|$|E

60|$|While he was {{handling}} over the dark-blue coat, {{the form of}} a ragged man darkened the side of the <b>show</b> <b>window</b> furthest from the door. With hardly a thought, Matt looked up to see who it was.|$|E
60|$|These and {{a hundred}} other cries rent the air. Then came a crash of window glass, and the next moment a huge brown bear leaped into the <b>show</b> <b>window,</b> not over two yards away from where Matt was standing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello, it's closed!" [...] exclaimed Ben, as {{they came}} in sight of the store; and he nodded in the {{direction}} of the <b>show</b> <b>window,</b> the curtain of which was drawn down. The curtain on the door was also down, and on the glass was pasted a sheet of note paper.|$|E

6000|$|With caution Tom {{went back}} to the store. He saw that the {{proprietor}} was in the rear parlor, dishing out ice-cream to several customers who had come in. The girl was also at the back. Swiftly Tom stuck the sheet of paper up under the <b>show</b> <b>window,</b> fastening it with the gummy seals. The paper read as follows: ...|$|E
60|$|Once on {{his hind}} legs the brown bear hesitated in his movements. He was {{separated}} from Matt by five feet of space between the <b>show</b> <b>window</b> and the raised platform upon which the boy stood. He {{did not seem to}} wish to leap the span, nor did he appear inclined to step down to the floor and then up upon the platform.|$|E
60|$|By {{that time}} Matt {{had set the}} {{carpenter}} and the glazier to work, and the new woodwork and the glass were in. All it needed {{was a couple of}} coats of paint, and the <b>show</b> <b>window</b> would be as good as new. The owner of the building, having heard of the affair, came around to view the situation, and expressed himself perfectly satisfied with what had been done.|$|E
60|$|The {{brilliant}} holiday {{display in}} the <b>show</b> <b>windows</b> charmed him, and he spent fully two hours in looking at all {{that was to be}} seen.|$|R

60|$|He recrossed the street, {{and peered}} {{through one of}} the <b>show</b> <b>windows</b> of the store. Then, of a sudden, he made a rapid motion for his chums to join him.|$|R
6000|$|Five blocks Soapy {{travelled}} {{before his}} courage permitted him to woo capture again. This time the opportunity presented what he fatuously termed to himself a [...] "cinch." [...] A young woman of a modest and pleasing guise was standing before a <b>show</b> <b>window</b> gazing with sprightly interest at its display of shaving mugs and inkstands, and two {{yards from the}} window a large policeman of severe demeanour leaned against a water plug.|$|E
60|$|At {{the first}} {{bars of the}} tune the brown bear {{appeared}} surprised. He raised himself up higher than ever on his hind legs, until his head touched {{the top of the}} <b>show</b> <b>window.</b> Then he started as if to dance, crashing over every article which was on exhibition. Finding he could not dance in the limited space around him, he leaped to the pavement outside, and there, to the bystanders' amazement and relief, began to execute a clumsy jig.|$|E
6000|$|Near the sad {{scene of}} the thoroughfare's {{dissolution}} stood the modest restaurant of Quigg.

50|$|While {{synchronizing}} television <b>shows,</b> <b>Windows</b> Media Center encodes the <b>shows</b> using <b>Windows</b> Media Encoder to a Windows Media Video format {{at a lower}} quality {{than the}} original format used for viewing on the desktop media center. This is to complement the limited storage space and processing power of such portable devices. Optionally, music can also be re-encoded to a smaller file size upon synchronization.|$|R
50|$|Microsoft had {{previously}} provided a Virtual Desktop PowerToy for Windows XP, which simulates many desktops {{with the more}} common method of hiding and <b>showing</b> <b>windows</b> in groups, each group being a different desktop. However, the functionality provided is less comprehensive than that of many other virtual desktop solutions (e. g. maintain a window in a given desktop even when its application bar button flashes, etc.). As with all virtual desktop utilities that work by hiding and <b>showing</b> <b>windows,</b> application compatibility problems are common, because application developers do not expect virtual desktops {{to be in use}} on the Windows platform.|$|R
50|$|To tile windows, {{the user}} selects {{them in the}} taskbar and uses the context menu choice Tile Vertically or Tile Horizontally. However, the wording of these options is misleading. Choosing Tile Vertically will cause the windows to tile {{horizontally}} but take on a vertical shape, while choosing Tile Horizontally will cause the windows to tile vertically but take on a horizontal shape. These options were later changed in <b>Windows</b> Vista to <b>Show</b> <b>Windows</b> Side by Side and <b>Show</b> <b>Windows</b> Stacked, respectively. Windows 7 adds the ability to drag windows {{to either side of}} the screen to create a simple side-by-side tiled layout, or {{to the top of the}} screen to maximize.|$|R
6000|$|He {{passed before}} {{the lights of}} Martin's restaurant, the most aristocratic in the city, and stopped. It {{was a place where}} he had often dined, in better days, and Martin knew him well. Standing aside, just out of the range of the light, he worshiped the quails and steaks in the <b>show</b> <b>window,</b> and {{imagined}} that may be the fairy times were not gone yet and some prince in disguise would come along presently and tell him {{to go in there and}} take whatever he wanted. He chewed his stick with a hungry interest as he warmed to his subject. Just at this juncture he was conscious of some one at his side, sure enough; and then a finger touched his arm. He looked up, over his shoulder, and saw an apparition--a very allegory of Hunger! It was a man six feet high, gaunt, unshaven, hung with rags; with a haggard face and sunken cheeks, and eyes that pleaded piteously. This phantom said: ...|$|E

Women on some points have better memories than men. Added to which, when you come to think of it, the game was a bit one-sided. Except that his moustache, maybe, was a little more imposing, and that he wore the clothes of a gentleman in place of those of an able- bodied seaman before the mast, he was to all intents and purposes the same as when they parted six years ago outside the church door; while she had changed from a child in a short muslin frock and a 'flapper,' as I believe they call it, tied up in blue ribbon, to a self-possessed young woman in a frock that might have come out of a Bond Street <b>show</b> <b>window,</b> and a Japanese coiffure, that being then the fashion.|$|E
