5|$|Published by Joseph Johnson, Mary {{itself was}} {{moderately}} successful, and sections {{of it were}} included in several collections of sentimental extracts that were popular at the time, such as The Young Gentleman and Lady's Instructor (1809).

5|$|Dr. Ariel Hanson is a {{scientist}} who becomes associated with Raynor's Raiders after her home colony on the planet Agria is invaded by Zerg in Wings of Liberty, where she is voiced by Ali Hillis. A selfless and altruistic individual, she mainly wishes for life to return to normal. She {{is considered to be}} the moral opposite of Tychus Findlay, acting as a metaphorical angel on Raynor's shoulder, and represents a positive moral influence on Raynor. Originally designed as a male character, Hanson was changed in development to female to act as a love interest for Raynor, albeit limited by Raynor's status as a mercenary and fugitive, and moreover the fact that Raynor is <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> to sort himself out in relation to Sarah Kerrigan.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Norman {{was visited}} {{by a young}} Bob Marley in his Bronx apartment. Norman had at that time written a number of songs for Johnny Nash, whose record label had just signed Marley, and Marley wanted {{to learn more about}} rhythm and blues. Along with Al Pyfrom, Norman's co-writer, and Marley's wife Rita, the pair spent several days in a jam session that {{ultimately}} resulted in a 24-minute tape of Marley performing several of his own and Norman-Pyfrom's compositions. According to Reggae archivist Roger Steffens, the tape—which was lost among Norman's possessions for decades—is rare for Marley in that it was influenced by pop music rather than reggae, highlighting a point in Marley's career when he was <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> to find his path. Some of the songs from this early jam session were released on the Marley album Chances Are.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} 20 {{years of the}} BAA/NBA, the league was <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> to gain the support of fans who lived {{in or near the}} teams' home markets. To achieve this, the league {{introduced}} the territorial pick rule to help teams acquire popular players from colleges in their area who would presumably have strong local support. Before the draft, a team could forfeit its first-round draft pick and then select any player from within a 50-mile radius of its home arena. Although the territorial picks were selected before the draft, these picks were not factored into the overall selection count of the draft; therefore, the first non-territorial pick of the draft was considered the first overall pick.|$|E
5|$|The neutral trading {{powers were}} <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> {{to arrange a}} peace. At Elateia, Philip had met with the same would-be peacemakers from Egypt and Rhodes who {{had been at the}} meeting in Heraclea, and again in the spring of 207 BC, but to no avail. Representatives of Egypt, Rhodes, Byzantium, Chios, Mytilene and perhaps Athens also met again with the Aetolians that spring. The war was going Philip's way, but the Aetolians, {{although}} now abandoned by both Pergamon and Rome, were not yet ready to make peace on Philip's terms. However, after another season's fighting, they finally relented. In 206 BC, the Aetolians, without Rome's consent, sued for a separate peace on conditions imposed by Philip.|$|E
5|$|In March 746 Ibn Surayj's army {{attacked}} Marv, but was repulsed {{with many}} casualties, and he then made common cause with al-Kirmani—of whose activities between his escape in 744 and this point nothing is known. With Marwan II <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> to consolidate his own position in Syria and Mesopotamia, Nasr was bereft of any hopes of reinforcement, and the allied armies of Ibn Surayj and al-Kirmani drove {{him out of}} Merv {{towards the end of}} 746. Nasr retreated to Nishapur, but within days al-Kirmani and Ibn Surayj fell out among themselves and clashed, resulting in the death of Ibn Surayj. Al-Kirmani then destroyed the Tamimi quarters in the city, a shocking act, as dwellings were traditionally considered exempt from warfare in Arab culture. As a result, the Mudari tribes, hitherto reserved towards Nasr, now came over to him. Backed by them, especially the Qaysis settled around Nishapur, Nasr now resolved to take back the capital. During summer 747, Nasr's and al-Kirmani's armies confronted each other before the walls of Marv, occupying two fortified camps and skirmishing with each other for several months. The fighting stopped only when news came of the start of the Hashimi uprising under Abu Muslim.|$|E

5|$|In the B story, April (Aubrey Plaza) {{is working}} as Chris' (Rob Lowe) {{assistant}} until {{he goes back}} to Indianapolis. April's cynical personality clashes with Chris' relentless optimism and happiness. In an attempt to get fired, April purposely neglects to tell Ann (Rashida Jones) that Chris cannot make a lunch date. When Ann arrives to confront Chris, she quickly realizes April's ploy. Ann reveals she is very happy dating Chris, and would even probably move with him to Indianapolis if asked. Andy (Chris Pratt), who is <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> to win back April's affections, gives Chris an obviously forged letter from the FBI claiming April must immediately return to the parks department. Chris sees through the ruse and tells April she can go back, but that remaining his assistant may provide her career opportunities. He invites her to return with him to Indianapolis and she seems interested, leaving both Ann and Andy stunned and jealous.|$|E

Meanwhile, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) officially makes Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) his new deputy. An explosion soon after causes the town to shake, followed by a sinkhole that emerges at an abandoned mine shaft. As Emma, Henry, Archie, and the sheriff show up to see the damaged area, Regina (Lana Parrilla) arrives to try to keep everyone from going any further, then comes across a certain object which looks like an ornate piece of glass and puts it in her pocket. She is also not pleased with the sheriff hiring Emma, and also reminds Archie that she can have him fired and out on the streets if he fails to succeed in dissuading Henry of the veracity of the fairy tale stories.|$|E

His plane lifted off from Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the country's military headquarters, just as rebel tanks were rolling in, attempting to block the runway. Thảo's men tried to capture the Saigon base of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, and its commander, Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, but were foiled, but they did capture a number of junta members at Tan Son Nhut.|$|E
