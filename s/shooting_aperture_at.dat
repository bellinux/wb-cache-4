Such lenses were commonly made into the 1960s.|$|R

5000|$|A lens with an [...] "automatic" [...] {{diaphragm}} {{allows the}} photographer {{to forget about}} closing the diaphragm to shooting aperture; such diaphragms have been taken for granted for decades. Usually this means a pin or lever {{on the back of}} the lens is pushed or released by a part of the shutter release mechanism in the camera body; the external automatic diaphragms on lenses for Exakta and Miranda cameras were the exception to that. Some lenses had [...] "semi-automatic" [...] diaphragms that closed to <b>shooting</b> <b>aperture</b> like an automatic diaphragm but had to be re-opened manually with a flip of a ring on the lens.|$|R

50|$|In imaging optics, all {{light rays}} {{crossing}} the input <b>aperture</b> <b>at</b> x1=xI are redirected by it towards the output <b>aperture</b> <b>at</b> x1=xO where xI=m xO.

We also prove that the degree of circular polarization in the probe NF does not depend in a significant way on the shape of the <b>aperture,</b> <b>at</b> variance with the far-field behavior.

50|$|For ACRIM, NIST {{determined}} that diffraction from the view-limiting aperture contributes a 0.13% signal not {{accounted for in}} the three ACRIM instruments. This correction lowers the reported ACRIM values, bringing ACRIM closer to TIM. In ACRIM and all other instruments, the aperture is deep inside the instrument, with a larger view-limiting <b>aperture</b> <b>at</b> the front. Depending on edge imperfections this can directly scatter light into the cavity. This design admits {{two to three times}} the amount of light intended to be measured; if not completely absorbed or scattered, this additional light produces erroneously high signals.
