In 1848 the Chester and Holyhead Railway opened, dramatically increasing the amount of sailings between Ireland and Great Britain.Work began in 1845 under the auspices of superintendent engineer J.M. Rendell. Following his death in 1856, the project was completed by John Hawkshaw.|$|E

25|$|The {{streets are}} fairly wide and straight, {{and many of}} the houses {{belonging}} to aristocratic families, descendants of those expelled from Al-Andalus by the Spanish Reconquista, possess marble fountains and have groves planted with orange trees. Within the houses the ceilings are often exquisitely carved and painted in Hispano-Moresque designs, such as are found in the Alhambra of Granada, and the tile-work for which Tetuan is known may be seen on floors, pillars and dados. The traditional industries are tilework, inlaying with silver wire, and the manufacture of thick-soled yellow slippers, much-esteemed flintlocks, and artistic towels used as cape and skirt by Arabic girls in rural areas. The Jews lived in a mellah, separated {{from the rest of the}} town by gates which were closed at night. The harbour of Tetuan was obstructed by a bar, over which only small vessels can pass, and the <b>roadstead,</b> <b>sheltered</b> to the north, Northwest and south, is exposed to the east, and is at times unsafe in consequence of the strong Levanter.|$|R
