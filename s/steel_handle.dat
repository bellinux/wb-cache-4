5000|$|Wello, {{a social}} venture, {{developed}} the WaterWheel to improve global access to water. The WaterWheel is a non-mechanical wheel enabling {{one person to}} transport 25 gallons (90 litres) of water, enough water for one family, in a single trip. A WaterWheel user can put up to 200 pounds (90 kg) {{of water in the}} [...] "wheel", a broad drum with round edges and a <b>steel</b> <b>handle,</b> transforming the water to an effective weight of approximately 22 pounds (10 kg). The design allows for easy maneuvering over different terrains, inclines, and corners. By reducing the number of daily trips needed to collect water, the WaterWheel allows women and children in developing countries to devote more time and energy to educational and economic activities. In addition, the WaterWheel is a sustainable solution for water transportation. It does not require any energy or other supplies in order to operate.

5000|$|Early cannons were muzzle-loading, {{but were}} {{replaced}} later with breech-loading models. These {{are used in}} modern whaling, {{with the exception of}} many Norwegian cannons which utilize an improved muzzle-loading design, with a breech firing system. In the early 20th century, almost all cannons were similar to the Kongsberg 90 mm design. With a trigger mounted {{on the back of a}} <b>steel</b> <b>handle</b> which would lever a thin rod up to the firing device in the horizontally sliding breechblock. To load, the rear cover plate would be rotated, exposing the back of the rectangular breechblock. The breechblock would be opened by rotating a handle on the top of the breech, and the spent cartridge case removed, to be reloaded with powder and wadding. A new cartridge would be prepared and slid up into the firing chamber, the breechblock would be closed by rotating the handle counterclockwise, the rear cover would be rotated back to cover the rear chamber, a harpoon would be prepared, inserted into the muzzle, and tied on. Then another rotating handle on the side of the breechblock would be pulled back to cock the firing pin. This handle was directly adjacent to the firing trigger on the block. The gun was solid steel, and had a glycerin recoil cylinder mounted under the barrel. The inner barrel and breech would bounce back on the recoil, while the handle and swivel in the deck would be mounted on a stationary outer cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|Actress, {{author and}} anti-slavery campaigner Fanny Kemble, who {{accompanied}} George Stephenson {{on a test}} of the L&M prior to its opening, described the tests in a letter written in early 1830: We were introduced to the little engine which was to drag us along the rails. She (for they make these curious little fire horses all mares) consisted of a boiler, a stove, a platform, a bench, and behind the bench a barrel containing enough water to prevent her being thirsty for fifteen miles, the whole machine not bigger than a common fire engine. She goes upon two wheels, which are her feet, and are moved by bright steel legs called pistons; these are propelled by steam, and in proportion as more steam is applied to the upper extremities (the hip-joints, I suppose) of these pistons, the faster they move the wheels; and when it is desirable to diminish the speed, the steam, which unless suffered to escape would burst the boiler, evaporates through a safety valve into the air. The reins, bit, and bridle of this wonderful beast, is a small <b>steel</b> <b>handle,</b> which applies or withdraws the steam from its legs or pistons, so that a child might manage it. The coals, which are its oats, were under the bench, and there was a small glass tube affixed to the boiler, with water in it, which indicates by its fullness or emptiness when the creature wants water, which is immediately conveyed to it from its reservoirs ...This snorting little animal, which I felt rather inclined to pat, was then harnessed to our carriage, and Mr. Stephenson having taken me on the bench of the engine with him, we started at about ten miles an hour ... Stephenson's way of explaining himself is peculiar, but very striking, and I understood, without difficulty, all that he said to me ... The engine having received its supply of water, the carriage was placed behind it, for it cannot turn, and was set off at its utmost speed, thirty-five miles an hour, swifter than a bird flies (for they tried the experiment with a snipe). You cannot conceive what that sensation of cutting the air was; the motion is as smooth as possible, too. I could either have read or written; and as it was, I stood up, and with my bonnet off 'drank the air before me.' The wind, which was strong, or perhaps the force of our own thrusting against it, absolutely weighed my eyelids down. When I closed my eyes this sensation of flying was quite delightful, and strange beyond description; yet strange as it was, I had a perfect sense of security, and not the slightest fear ...Now for a word or two about the master of all these marvels, with whom I am most horribly in love. He is a man from fifty to fifty-five years of age; his face is fine, though careworn, and bears an expression of deep thoughtfulness; his mode of explaining his ideas is peculiar and very original, striking, and forcible; and although his accents indicates strongly his north country birth, his language has not the slightest touch of vulgarity or coarseness. He has certainly turned my head. Four years have sufficed to bring this great undertaking to an end. The railroad will be opened upon the fifteenth of next month. The Duke of Wellington is coming down to be present on the occasion, and, I suppose, what with the thousands of spectators and the novelty of the spectacle, there will never have been a scene of more striking interest.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cryptographic {{devices such}} as Hardware Security Modules are only as secure as their {{application}} programming interfaces (APIs) that offer cryp-tographic functionality to the outside world. Design flaws and implementation errors in security APIs {{have been shown to}} cause vulnerabilities that may leak secrets such as keys and PINs. Ideally, we would like to design such interfaces {{in such a way that}} we can formally prove security properties, even in the presence of some corrupted keys. In this work, we propose the first such provably secure interface to support asymmetric key operations for key management: Cachin and Chandran’s secure token interface supports asymmetric key operations only for encrypting and signing data, but not for managing keys, while Cortier and <b>Steel</b> <b>handle</b> only symmetric keys. Due to the fact that anyone can encrypt under a public key, in order to secure integrity of the keys under management, we must consider confidentiality and integrity properties separately and provide support for classical operations of public key infrastructure (e. g. certification of public keys). ...|$|E
40|$|Pellet {{cladding}} interaction (PCI) {{as well as}} pellet cladding mechanical interaction (PCMI) are well-known fuel {{failures in}} light water reactors, especially in boiling water reactors (BWR). Whereas the thermo-mechanical processes of PCI effects have been intensively investigated in the last decades, only rare information {{is available on the}} role of neutron physics. However, each power transient is primary due to neutron physics effects and thus knowledge of the neutron physical background is mandatory to better understand the occurrence of PCI effects in BWRs. This paper will focus on a study of local power excursions in a typical BWR fuel assembly during control rod movements. Burn-up and energy deposition were simulated with high spatial granularity, especially {{in the vicinity of the}} control blade tip. It could be shown, that the design of the control blade plays a dominant role for the occurrence of local power peaks while instantaneously moving down the control rod. The main result is, that the largest power peak occurs at the interface between <b>steel</b> <b>handle</b> and absorber rods. A full width half maximum (FWHM) of +/- 2. 5 cm was observed. This means, the local power excursion due to neutron physics phenomena involve approximately five pellets. With the VESTA code coupled MCNP(X) /ORIGEN 2. 2 calculations were performed with more than 3400 burn-up zones in order to take history effects into account. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Com a implantaÃÃo do Sistema de Plantio Direto, a palha passou a ter importante papel no sistema de manejo cultural, atuando como agente de recuperaÃÃo ou manutenÃÃo das propriedades fÃsicas, quÃmicas e biolÃgicas do solo, sendo usada como indicativo de qualidade do SPD. Apesar disso, o seu manejo nÃo tem sido adequado, sendo comum observar, no campo, faixas com diferentes concentraÃÃes de palha, resultado da colheita mecanizada com colhedoras autopropelidas. Nesse contexto, o objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar a uniformidade de distribuiÃÃo de palha por colhedoras autopropelidas na colheita da soja. Para a coleta dos resÃduos, utilizou-se uma armaÃÃo com dimensÃo de um metro de largura por dez metros de comprimento, subdividida em seÃÃes de 0, 5 metro quadrado, confeccionada em lona, ferro e cabo de aÃo. As colhedoras foram avaliadas em condiÃÃes normais de operaÃÃo, com quatro repetiÃÃes de coleta de palha. Para comparaÃÃo das mÃquinas e avaliaÃÃo da uniformidade de distribuiÃÃo {{transversal}} de palha, foi utilizado o coeficiente de variaÃÃo (CV). Todas as colhedoras apresentaram distribuiÃÃo desuniforme, resultando em faixas com elevada concentraÃÃo de palha na parte central da linha de deslocamento da colhedora e pouco nas extremidades, independentemente da largura da plataforma de corte. Apenas uma colhedora apresentou distribuiÃÃo prÃxima da ideal, por possuir um sistema distribuidor para a palha proveniente das peneiras. Constatou-se que a palha oriunda das peneiras da colhedora pode ser a responsÃvel pela formaÃÃo das faixas com elevadas quantidades de palha na parte central, independente do tamanho da mÃquina. With the no tillage system implantation, {{the straw}} started to have important {{paper in the}} system field management. It acts as agent of recovery or maintenance the physical, chemical and biological soil properties, being used as indicative of quality of the system. Despite this, its handling has not been adjusted, being common to notice itself in the field, bands with different straw concentrations, result of the mechanized harvest. In this context, the work objective was to evaluate the uniformity of combine straw distribution in the soybean harvest. For {{the collection of the}} residues was used a scaffolding with dimension of a meter of width for ten meters of length, subdivided in sections of 0, 5 square meters, confectioned in canvas, iron, and <b>steel</b> <b>handle.</b> The combines had been evaluated in normal conditions of operation, with four repetitions of straw collection. For comparison of the machines, and evaluation of the uniformity of transverse straw distribution was used the Coefficient of Variation (CV). All combines had presented a different distribution, resulting in bands, with raised straw concentration in the central combine part, and little in the extremities, independently of the cut platform width. But a combine presented distribution next to the ideal, for possessing a deliverering system for the straw proceeding from the bolters. The necessity of a deliverering mechanism for the same one was evidenced that the deriving straw of the combine bolters can be main the responsible one for the bands formation, with raised straw amounts {{in the center of the}} combine. It has, therefore, the necessity to develop a deliverering mechanism to equip the combines and to distribute the straw, independently of the machine size...|$|E
5000|$|Stainless <b>steel</b> <b>handles</b> are {{the most}} durable of all handles, {{as well as the}} most sanitary. Many argue, however, that they are very {{slippery}} in the hand, especially when wet. To counter this, many premium knife makers make handles with ridges, bumps, or indentations to provide extra grip. One disadvantage of some all-metal handles is that knife weight usually goes up considerably, affecting the knife's balance and increasing hand and wrist fatigue. Knife manufacturers, most notably Japan's Global, have begun addressing this issue by producing hollow-handled knives.|$|R
