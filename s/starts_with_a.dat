If there is no unanimous agreement, then the contestants are given a 15-second grace period (10 seconds in season one only) before their bank begins to drain. Once there is a unanimous agreement, the chosen contestant is eliminated from the show with no winnings.|$|E

5|$|The novel <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{narration}} by its protagonist, Cal (his masculine identity), {{also known}} as Calliope (feminine): He recounts how 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, a recessive condition, caused him to be born with female characteristics. The book continues with accounts of his family's history, starting with his paternal grandparents in their home village and ending with his father's funeral. These accounts cover the conception of Cal, his teenage years, and the discovery of his intersex condition. Throughout the book, Cal weaves his opinion of the events in hindsight and of his life after his father's funeral. Eugenides sets Middlesex in the 20th century and interjects historical elements, such as the Balkan Wars, the Nation of Islam, the 1967 Detroit riot, and the Watergate scandal in the story.|$|E
5|$|A repeat {{performance}} of BWV243a may have accompanied the first performance of BWV10 on 2July 1724. The libretto of the cantata performed in Leipzig at {{the feast of}} the Visitation of 1725 survives. Maria Aurora von Königsmarck is the possible author of this Magnificat paraphrase. Around a decade before the libretto was reprinted in Leipzig it had already been set by Reinhard Keiser and Johann Mattheson. It is not known whether Bach set the libretto, neither which setting of the libretto was used for the 1725 Visitation feast in Leipzig. A year later Bach performed Der Herr wird ein Neues im Lande, JLB13, a Visitation cantata by his second cousin Johann Ludwig Bach. Picander's libretto for the Visitation cantata of 1728 may have been set as part of Bach's fourth cantata cycle: the libretto, surviving without music, <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dictum quoted from Luther's German translation of Luke1:46–47.|$|E

5|$|If {{the date}} and time of any solar eclipse are known, it is {{possible}} to predict other eclipses using eclipse cycles. The saros is probably the best known {{and one of the most}} accurate. A saros lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120° in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A saros series always <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region. A saros series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central.|$|E
5|$|On the {{top right}} corner of the model for a surface weather map is the {{pressure}}, showing the last two integer digits of the pressure in millibars, or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7hPa, the pressure portion of the station model will read 997. Although the first digit or two of the pressure is left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the station model allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, the pressure is replaced with the height of the pressure surface.|$|E
5|$|Pettibone was {{selected}} by the Philadelphia Phillies {{in the third round}} of the 2008 MLB draft. That year, he started his professional career {{as a member of the}} Gulf Coast League Phillies, with whom he made only one appearance, allowing two unearned runs in one inning, and thus receiving the loss. At the conclusion of the season, he participated in the Florida Instructional League (FIL). In 2009, he played for the Williamsport Crosscutters of the New York–Penn League (Single-A short season). In June, he made three starts and compiled an 0.56 earned run average (ERA) in them, which helped him earn NY-Penn player of the week honors for June 22–28. Overall, he went 2–4 in nine games (eight <b>starts)</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 5.35 ERA and thirty-six strikeouts in 35 innings, and again participated in the FIL at the end of the season.|$|E
