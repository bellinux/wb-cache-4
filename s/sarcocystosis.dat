50|$|Professor Marshall Lightowlers {{began his}} career in the field of {{parasitology}} during a post-doctoral appointment at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science in Adelaide where he undertook research on ovine <b>sarcocystosis.</b> In 1981 he began a post-doctoral position at The University of Melbourne, Veterinary Clinical Centre and began a research career focusing on the immunology and molecular biology of taeniid cestode parasites. His initial research at the University of Melbourne investigated the immunochemistry of antigens of Taenia taeniaeformis and Echinococcus granulosus. Subsequently {{he was a member of}} a team of scientists that developed a vaccine against Taenia ovis infection in sheep, the first recombinant vaccine against a parasitic disease. In 1989 Lightowlers took over leadership of the molecular parasitology research laboratories at the University of Melbourne and began applying the lessons learnt in the T. ovis research to the development of similar vaccines against infection with the larval stages of other cestode parasites. This led to the development of highly effective, recombinant vaccines against cysticercosis in cattle due to Taenia saginata and in pigs due to Taenia solium. In collaboration with Dr David Heath in New Zealand, he and his colleagues also produced a recombinant vaccine against hydatid disease in sheep. This vaccine has proven successful in experimental trials carried out in Argentina, China, New Zealand and Australia and is being manufactured for commercial application. These vaccines remain uniquely effective in the field of parasitology. In 1990 Lightowlers was appointed a Research Fellow of the National Health and Medical Research Council and subsequently promoted to Principal Research Fellow and Professor in the Faculty of Veterinary Science at Melbourne University. He has published more than one hundred articles in internationally refereed journals and books. Recognition of his scientific standing is evident from his numerous invited contributions to national and international scientific meetings and invited review publications and his receipt of substantial, competitive research funding. He had been a member of the World Health Organisation's Informal Working Groups on Echinococcosis since 1988 and is currently coordinator of the group evaluating vaccines. A major feature of Lightowler’s career has been his dedication to training highly successful postgraduate students, staff and sabbatical visitors in the discipline of parasitology. Lightowlers has been an active member of the Australian Society for Parasitology, serving as the society's President in 1995/6, Honorary Secretary, and as a council member representing Victoria. In 1998 the society awarded Lightowlers the Bancroft-Mackerras Medal in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the science of parasitology.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sarcocystosis</b> is a {{zoonotic}} disease {{caused by a}} coccidian intracellular protozoan parasite of the genus Sarcocystis. More than 200 Sarcocystis species have been recorded and the parasites are found in mammals, birds and reptiles. They require two hosts to complete their life cycle. In Malaysia, <b>sarcocystosis</b> was reported as a potential emerging food and water-borne disease {{after a series of}} large outbreak of human infections. There was not enough attention given before even though it was reported in both humans and animals. The first human case of invasive muscular <b>sarcocystosis</b> among local Malaysian was reported in 1975. Besides, a retrospective autopsy examination on 100 tongues revealed 21 % positive cases. On top of that, a sero-epidemiological survey conducted in 243 subjects in West Malaysia showed that 19. 7 % had Sarcocystis antibodies. The clinical symptoms of muscular <b>sarcocystosis</b> were first described comprehensively in 1999. Meanwhile, many types of animals including livestock were found harbor the sarcocysts in their tissue. The first case of human intestinal <b>sarcocystosis</b> was reported in 2014. This review indicates that human <b>sarcocystosis</b> is currently endemic in Malaysia and parallel to that reported in animals. However, more studies and investigations need to be conducted since the source of human infection remains unknown...|$|E
40|$|Sarcocystis is {{a tissue}} coccidian with an {{obligatory}} two-host life cycle. The sexual generations of gametogony and sporogony {{occur in the}} lamina propria of the small intestine of definitive hosts which shed infective sporocysts in their stools and present with intestinal <b>sarcocystosis.</b> Asexual multiplication occurs in the skeletal and cardiac muscles of intermediate hosts which harbor Sarcocystis cysts in their muscles and present with muscular <b>sarcocystosis.</b> In Malaysia, Sarcocystis cysts have been reported from many domestic and wild animals, including domestic and field rats, moonrats, bandicoots, slow loris, buffalo, and monkey, and man. The known definitive hosts for some species of Sarcocystis are the domestic cat, dog and the reticulated python. Human muscular <b>sarcocystosis</b> in Malaysia is a zoonotic infection acquired by contamination of food or drink with sporocysts shed by definitive hosts. The cysts reported in human muscle resembled those seen in the moonrat, Echinosorex gymnurus, and the long-tailed monkey, Macaca fascicularis. While human intestinal <b>sarcocystosis</b> has not been reported in Malaysia so far, it can be assumed that such cases may not be infrequent {{in view of the}} occurrence of Sarcocystis cysts in meat animals, such as buffalo. The overall seroprevalence of 19. 8 % reported among the main racial groups in Malaysia indicates that <b>sarcocystosis</b> (both the intestinal and muscular forms) may be emerging as a significant food-borne zoonotic infection in the country...|$|E

40|$|There {{are over}} 150 known Sarcocystis species, {{and at least}} one is capable of infecting and causing disease in man. Extra{{intestinal}} (muscular) <b>sarcocystosis</b> and intestinal <b>sarcocystosis</b> are the two known manifestations of disease in humans. In this series of six cases and review, we focus on the invasive extraintestinal ("muscular") form of <b>sarcocystosis</b> in humans. This disease, which until recently was rarely described, has become relevant particularly as an imported condition in travelers due to a recent series of outbreaks reported from Malaysia. Human intestinal <b>sarcocystosis</b> is ubiquitous across the globe. However, absolute numbers of probable and particularly confirmed cases are few, with only several hundred described to date. Characteristically, patients exhibit signs and symptoms either 1 - 2 weeks after exposure, or after 4 - 8 weeks. Whether people remain asymptomatic or develop disease apparently depends on the infecting species, host factors, and the inoculum size. The definitive host(s) remain uncertain, and identification of the animal reservoir(s) requires further research. A better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease, as well as its immunological determinants, is hampered by the lack of reliable serological diagnostic methods. Additionally, DNA seems to be contained very effectively within the encysted parasite, thereby rendering PCR detection unreliable. Physicians should suspect the condition in patients with suggestive symptoms and a possible history of exposure.

40|$|Sarcocysts are protozoans {{that live}} as parasites in cells, {{primarily}} in muscle meat, of higher animals. Humans could also act as hosts for parasite multiplication. In this case, sarcocysto-sis may develop a non-notifiable disease that manifests symptoms like nausea, stomach ache and diarrhoea. The infection chain of the parasites {{is supported by}} the contamination of the environment with faeces. After infection humans excrete highly resistant, persistent forms of the parasite, sporocysts, in faeces. They are taken up by an intermediate host and multiply both in muscle meat and in the intestines. Intermediate hosts for the types of parasite of relevance for hu-mans are pigs and cattle. Several studies on <b>sarcocystosis</b> infection in pigs have shown that these animals, particularly in the case of free-range farming may be highly infected with sarcocysts. Against this back-drop the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has undertaken an assessment of sar-cocystosis infection in pigs and the importance of <b>sarcocystosis</b> in humans. The results of the assessment indicate that infected pork can, in principle, constitute a source of infection for humans who consume raw meat and raw sausage products. Case studies on <b>sarcocystosis</b> in humans are, however, rather rare in Germany. In order to prevent infection BfR advises that meat products be sufficiently heated prior to consumption or frozen for at least three days at temperatures of at least minus 20 °C. In order to interrupt the chain of infection in livestock like pigs, all hygiene measures should be oriented towards preventing the transmission of the sporocysts excreted by humans to pigs. They include the installation of impeccable toilets, the avoidance of feed contamination with faeces or wastewater sludge and compliance with the Sewage Sludge Ordinance...|$|E

In 1987, {{survey of the}} macroscopic S. fusiformis cysts in market beef mainly from old water buffalos aged more than 15 years were commonly observed in Bangkok. In 2005, the macroscopic cyst was no longer seen in beef of cattle and water buffalo aged less than three years. Objective: The epidemiological investigation of Sarcocystis spp. infected meat in Bangkok and Lampang. Material and method: Samples {{for each of the}} tongue and beef of cattle and water buffalo, pork from Bangkok markets and pork of domestic swine from some remote villages in various subprovinces (Ampurs) in Lampang were obtained for microscopic examination by H and E and selectively by PAS staining. Results: The microscopic S. fusiformis cysts were seen in all five specimens of tongues and ten specimens of muscles of cattle and water buffalo obtained from fresh-food markets in Bangkok.

40|$|Sarcocystis spp. are obligate {{intracellular}} protozoan parasites {{which cause}} meat-borne parasitic disease. In Malaysia, <b>sarcocystosis</b> {{is seen as}} a potential emerging food-borne zoonosis after a series of large outbreak of human infections. Humans acquire infection either by ingestion of cyst in raw or undercooked infected meat or from sporocysts in contaminated food and water. The goal {{of this study is to}} identify the presence of sarcocystis parasites in meat of cattle, buffaloes, sheep and goats collected from local markets in Selangor, Malaysia. Methods: A total of 64 skeletal muscles samples (57 cattle, 2 buffaloes, 4 goats and 1 sheep) were collected from local markets. The samples were cut randomly into three pieces, squashed firmly between two glass slides and then examined microscopically for the presence of cysts. Results: Three samples of meat (4. 69 %) from cattle (1), buffalo (1) and sheep (1) were found to be positive for cysts. The cysts were confirmed by PCR as sarcocystis sp...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sarcocystosis</b> {{is caused}} by species of Sarcocystis, an {{intracellular}} protozoan parasite in the phylum Apicomplexa. These parasites have an indirect life cycle, cycling between a definitive and an intermediate host. Intestinal infections occur in the definitive host, and tissue invasion {{is seen in the}} intermediate host. More than a hundred species of Sarcocystis are parasites of domestic and wild animals. Many of these infections are asymptomatic, particularly in the definitive host. Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis is usually caused by Sarcocystis neurona. Neospora caninum and/or Neospora hughesi, not discussed in this outline, have also been implicated in some cases. Symptomatic infections caused by Sarcocystis species are reported occasionally in other domestic animals. Humans are a definitive host for S. suihominis, found in pork, and S. hominis, found in beef. These parasites infect the intestines. Humans can be intermediate hosts for a variety of other Sarcocystis species. The parasites are found in the muscles. The species of Sarcocystis involved is, in many cases, unknown. Geographic Distributio...|$|E
40|$|Populations of wildfowl {{have been}} {{categorised}} taxonomically into five families: Phasianidae, Tetraonidae, Scolopacidae, Otidae and Anatidae. They {{are of particular}} importance for agriculture, forestry and the game economy, and certain species also {{have an important role}} in the epizootiology of parasitic infections in domestic fowl and fish. That is why it is extremely important for the process of promoting the system of animal health protection to have knowledge regarding the etiology and epizootiology of parasitic infections in wildfowl. Diseases in wildfowl caused by protozoa are histomoniasis, trichomoniasis, malaria, coccidiosis, cryptosporidiosis, <b>sarcocystosis,</b> toxoplasmosis, and giardiasis. The most represented helminthiases in wildfowl are singamosis, capillariasis, trichostrongyliasis, ascaridiosis, heteraciosis, nematodosis of the glandular stomach, cestodoses and trematodoses. The most significant ectoparasites in wildfowl are mites, ticks, and fleas. The reduction of populations of certain widlfowl species in nature could present a major problem, having in mind the important role of these birds in ecosystems and biocenosis. The incidence, maintaining and spreading of parasitic infections among widlfowl are just some of the factors that affect the numbers of their populations...|$|E
