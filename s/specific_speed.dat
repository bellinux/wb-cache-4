The act does not stipulate a <b>specific</b> <b>speed</b> for the simulated noise but requires the U.S. Department of Transportation to study and establish a motor vehicle safety standard that would set requirements for an alert sound that allows blind and other pedestrians to reasonably detect a nearby electric or hybrid vehicle, and the ruling must be finalized within eighteen months. The bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 4, 2011.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{contribution}} {{deals with}} a numerical solution of a centrifugal impeller's prime geometry. A numerical description of impeller's geometry {{is transformed into a}} 3 D CAD software. The numerical solution is based on a one dimensional theory with a correction to a finite blade count. The proposed prime geometry is supposed to be tested through a CFD simulation. The aim of the CFD simulation is to optimize the prime geometry of a pump. The numerical solution of the prime geometry varies according to <b>specific</b> <b>speeds</b> and a shape of the impeller's main streamline. An interface between the numerical solution and 3 D CAD program is provided by a text document. Some examples of impellers with different <b>specific</b> <b>speeds</b> are being shown in the paper...|$|R

He also implicitly believed that lightning causes thunder.|$|R
25|$|For {{increased}} safety, each {{vehicle is}} also fitted {{with an automatic}} brake that is triggered if the vehicle exceeds a <b>specific</b> <b>speed,</b> such as a carriage running away or a locomotive engine failure. This system slows the train down using the same brake blocks and drums as the hand brake. The running speed at which the automatic brake comes on is lower for the carriages than the locomotive, to prevent a carriage running into a stationary locomotive further down the track.|$|E
25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{consists}} of much fewer blades i.e., two to six, {{as compared to}} ducted fans. Axial fans operate at high <b>specific</b> <b>speed</b> i.e., high flow rate and low head and hence adding more blades will restrict the high flow rate required for its operation. Due to fewer blades, {{they are unable to}} impose their geometry on the flow, making the rotor geometry and the inlet and outlet velocity triangles meaningless. Also the blades are made very long with varying blade sections along the radius.|$|E
25|$|By {{designing}} the fan blades with proper hub-to-tip ratio and analyzing {{performance on the}} number of blades so that the flow doesn't separate on the blade surface these effects can be reduced. Some of the methods to overcome these effects are re-circulation of excess air through the fan, axial fans are high <b>specific</b> <b>speed</b> devices operating them at high efficiency and to minimize the effects they have to be operated at low speeds. For controlling and directing the flow use of guide vanes is suggested. Turbulent flows at the inlet and outlet of the fans cause stalling so the flow should be made laminar by the introduction of a stator to prevent the effect.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For {{the closed}} loop water system, taking ISG single stage single suction {{centrifugal}} pumps for example, we calculate {{the flow of}} the single pump and the system, which is regulated by changing the number of parallel water pumps. According to the <b>specific</b> <b>speeds,</b> during the regulation, we induce the relations between the relative flow and the relative numbers of the single pump and the system, respectively. These relations {{can be applied to the}} flow forecasting of parallel water pumps with variable numbers in the closed loop water system...|$|R

50|$|The {{positions}} and periods {{of the planets}} was calculated relative to uniformly moving points. In the case of Mercury and Venus, they move around the Earth at the same mean speed as the Sun. In the case of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, they move around the Earth at <b>specific</b> <b>speeds,</b> representing each planet's motion through the zodiac. Most historians of astronomy consider that this two-epicycle model reflects elements of pre-Ptolemaic Greek astronomy. Another element in Aryabhata's model, the śīghrocca, the basic planetary period {{in relation to the}} Sun, is seen by some historians as a sign of an underlying heliocentric model.|$|R
25|$|This disc rotates {{at a fixed}} <b>specific</b> <b>speed,</b> set by the user. Each disc {{rotation}} speed is set to a particular frequency of the desired note. If the note being played (and making the lamps behind the disc flash) is {{at exactly the same}} frequency as the spinning of the disc, then the disc appears to be static (due to the persistence of vision) from the strobing effect. If the note is out of tune then the pattern appears to be moving as the light flashing and the disc rotation are out of sync from each other. The more out of tune the played note is, the faster the pattern seems to be moving, although in reality it always spins at the same speed for a given note. Many good turntables for vinyl disc records have stroboscopic patterns lit by the incoming AC power (mains). The power frequency, either 50 or 60Hz, serves as the reference, although commercial power frequency sometimes changes slightly (a few tenths of a percent) with varying load. Unless reference and measured quantity are interchanged, the operating principle is the same; the turntable speed is adjusted to stop drifting of the pattern.|$|E
500|$|The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism issued {{guidelines}} for hybrid and other near-silent vehicles in January 2010. In the United States the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010 {{was approved by}} the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives in December 2010. The act does not stipulate a <b>specific</b> <b>speed</b> for the simulated noise but requires the U.S. Department of Transportation to study and establish a motor vehicle safety standard that would set requirements for an alert sound. A proposed rule was published for comment by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in January, 2013. It would require hybrids and electric vehicles traveling at less than [...] to emit warning sounds that pedestrians must be able to hear over background noises. According to the NHTSA proposal carmakers would be able to pick the sounds the vehicles make from a range of choices, and similar vehicles would have to make the same sounds. The rules were scheduled to go into effect in September 2014. However, in January 2015 the NHTSA rescheduled the date for a final ruling to the end of 2015. Since the regulation comes into force three years after being rendered as a final rule, compliance was delayed to 2018.|$|E

[...] Like the receiving tests, there are separate competitions for sending five character groups of just the twenty-six letter of the Latin alphabet, just the ten Arabic numerals, or a mixed content of letters, numbers, and some punctuation symbols.

The remainder of the route was an unimproved dirt road until [...] NY9H was extended north around the western edge of Valatie to its current northern terminus [...] In May 1957, the Ghent School District lobbied the state to reduce the speed limit on NY9H between NY66 and CR20. The district believed that the existing speed limit posed a danger to both children waiting for school buses and to members of the West Ghent Fire Department, located on NY9H near NY66.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a new {{approach}} to identify the parameters of robot manipulator dynamics is presented. The approach is based on exciting the robot manipulator with multiple identification trajectories that pass through the operating point with <b>specific</b> <b>speeds</b> and accelerations. The position, velocity and acceleration of the robot joints along with the corresponding torque at the operating point are recorded. The relative change of the joint motion and the corresponding torque compared to a reference operating point trajectory is used to identify the robot dynamics parameters. By using perturbed rather than the absolute motion values, several modeled and unmodeled effects can be eliminated from the identification equations. This is very useful when an accurate model of the robot dynamics at specific operating point(s) of the workspace is required...|$|R

The prediction performance of the proposed method here is tested against four sets of measured total heads and efficiencies of mixed-flow pumps, and it is also compared with that based on two-dimensional cascade theory. Predicted results by the present set of loss models agree very well with experimental data for a variety of mixed-flow pumps over the normal operating conditions...|$|R
