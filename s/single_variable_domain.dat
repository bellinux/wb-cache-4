40|$|Conditionally replicative adenoviruses are {{promising}} agents for oncolytic virotherapy. Various approaches have been attempted to retarget adenoviruses to tumor-specific antigens to circumvent deficiency of receptor for adenoviral binding {{and to provide}} an additional level of tumor specificity. Functional incorporation of highly specific targeting molecules into the viral capsid can potentially retarget adenoviral infection. However, conventional antibodies are not compatible with the cytoplasmic adenovirus capsid synthesis. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the utility of single variable domains derived from heavy chain camelid antibodies for retargeting of adenovirus infection. We have combined transcriptional targeting using a tumor-specific promoter with transductional targeting through viral capsid incorporation of antihuman carcinoembryonic antigen single variable domains. Obtained data demonstrated that employment of a <b>single</b> <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> genetically incorporated into an adenovirus fiber increased specificity of infection and efficacy of replication of single variable domain-targeted oncolytic adenovirus. The double targeting, both transcriptional through the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 promoter and transductional using the <b>single</b> <b>variable</b> <b>domain,</b> is a promising means to improve the therapeutic index for these advanced generation conditionally replicative adenoviruses. A successful strategy to transductional retargeting of oncolytic adenovirus infection has not been shown before and therefore we believe this is the first employment of transductional targeting using single variable domains derived from heavy chain camelid antibodies to enhance specificity of conditionally replicative adenoviruses...|$|E

Here we report the isolation and characterization of functional VHH-based immunoglobulin <b>single</b> <b>variable</b> <b>domains</b> (or nanobodies) against the chemokine receptor CXCR 4. Two highly selective monovalent nanobodies, 238 D 2 and 238 D 4, were obtained using a time-efficient whole cell immunization, phage display, and counterselection method. The highly selective VHH-based immunoglobulin <b>single</b> <b>variable</b> <b>domains</b> competitively inhibited the CXCR 4 -mediated signaling and antagonized the chemoattractant effect of the CXCR 4 ligand CXCL 12. Epitope mapping showed that the two nanobodies bind to distinct but partially overlapping sites in the extracellular loops. Short peptide linkage of 238 D 2 with 238 D 4 resulted in significantly increased affinity for CXCR 4 and picomolar activity in antichemotactic assays. Interestingly, the monovalent nanobodies behaved as neutral antagonists, whereas the biparatopic nanobodies acted as inverse agonists at the constitutively active CXCR 4 -N 3. 35 A. The CXCR 4 nanobodies displayed strong antiretroviral activity against T cell-tropic and dual-tropic HIV- 1 strains. Moreover, the biparatopic nanobody effectively mobilized CD 34 -positive stem cells in cynomolgus monkeys.

A total of 33 VHH and 39 VH unique sequences were identified, encoded by 42 and 50 different genes, respectively. Sequence comparison indicates that the VHHs evolved within the VH subgroup III. Nevertheless, the VHH germline segments are highly diverse, leading to a broad structural repertoire of the antigen-binding loops. Seven VHH subfamilies were recognized, of which five were confirmed to be expressed in vivo. Comparison of germline and cDNA sequences demonstrates that the rearranged VHHs are extensively diversified by somatic mutation processes, leading to an additional hypervariable region and a high incidence of nucleotide insertions or deletions. These diversification processes are driven by hypermutation and recombination hotspots embedded in the VHH germline genes at the regions affecting the structure of the antigen-binding loops...|$|E

In this study, we identified {{a panel of}} four nanobodies, <b>single</b> <b>variable</b> <b>domains</b> of dromedary heavy-chain antibodies that specifically recognize the TAG- 72 antigen. All selected nanobodies were shown to selectively bind to this cancer-related molecule with low-nanomolar affinities and do not cross-react with other antigens, such as MUC 1 or HER 2. Furthermore, they can detect TAG- 72 in concentrations as low as 5  U/ml which is valuable in sensitive detection of this molecule in cancerous patients. Cell ELISA experiments proved their ability for binding to the native target antigen on TAG- 72 expressing cells while not showing any reactivity to HT- 29 cells, a TAG- 72 -negative cell line. Using competition studies, we found that each nanobody recognizes a distinct epitope on the TAG- 72 antigen {{that is different from}} the one recognized by the mouse anti-TAG- 72 antibody, CC 49.

40|$|There is a {{major need}} in target {{validation}} and therapeutic applications for molecules that can interfere with protein function inside cells. Intracellular antibodies (intrabodies) can bind to specific targets in cells but isolation of intrabodies is currently difficult. Intrabodies are normally single chain Fv fragments comprising variable domains of the immunoglobulin heavy (VH) and light chains (VL).

We have used this intracellular <b>single</b> <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> (IDab) format, based on a previously characterised intrabody consensus scaffold, to generate diverse intrabody libraries for direct in vivo screening. IDabs were isolated using two distinct antigens and affinities of isolated IDabs ranged between 20 nM and 200 nM. Moreover, IDabs selected for binding to the RAS protein could inhibit RAS-dependent oncogenic transformation of NIH 3 T 3 cells. The IDab format is therefore ideal for in vivo intrabody use.

In this report, we construct and characterize a diversity enhanced semi-synthetic NAR V display library based on naturally occurring NAR V sequences. Results A semi-synthetic shark sdAb display library with a complexity close to 1 e 9 was constructed. This was achieved by introducing size and sequence variations in CDR 3 using randomized CDR 3 primers of three different lengths.

They are highly soluble, stable, {{and can be}} linked to build multi-specific formats. Several Nanobodies are currently in clinical development in different therapeutic areas, for both chronic and acute applications. For the former, prolonged exposure is achieved by half-life extending moieties that target endogenous albumin, while for the latter, non-half-life extended constructs are preferable. To demonstrate the general pharmacokinetic behavior of both formats, serum levels of seven intravenously administered Nanobodies were analyzed in cynomolgus monkeys, mice or rabbits. In monkeys, the total clearance of a monomeric irrelevant Nanobody was rapid (2. 0 mL/(min*kg)) and approximated the species glomerular filtration rate, indirectly suggesting that the Nanobody was mainly eliminated via the kidneys. When linked to an anti-albumin Nanobody, a 376 -fold decrease in clearance was observed, resulting in a terminal half-life of 4. 9 days, corresponding to the expected species albumin half-life. Similar conclusions were drawn for (non-) half-life extended mono-, bi- and trimeric Nanobodies in mice or rabbits, suggesting that these kinetic principles apply across species. Applying this knowledge to species translation and study design is crucial for successful pre-clinical development of novel therapeutic Nanobody candidates...|$|E

Conversely, heavy chain-only camelid antibodies, which lack a light chain, must rely entirely on a <b>single</b> <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> to recognize haptens. While several anti-hapten VHHs have been generated, {{little is known}} regarding the underlying structural and thermodynamic basis for hapten recognition. Here, an anti-methotrexate VHH (anti-MTX VHH) was generated using grafting methods whereby the three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) were inserted onto an existing VHH framework. Thermodynamic analysis of the anti-MTX VHH CDR 1 - 3 Graft revealed a micromolar binding affinity, while the crystal structure of the complex revealed a somewhat surprising noncanonical binding site which involved MTX tunneling under the CDR 1 loop. Due to the close proximity of MTX to CDR 4, a nonhypervariable loop, the CDR 4 loop sequence was subsequently introduced into the CDR 1 - 3 graft, {{which resulted in a}} dramatic 1000 -fold increase in the binding affinity. Crystal structure analysis of both the free and complex anti-MTX CDR 1 - 4 graft revealed CDR 4 plays a significant role in both intermolecular contacts and binding site conformation that appear to contribute toward high affinity binding.

40|$|JJX 12 is an {{engineered}} bispecific antibody against ricin, {{a member}} of the medically important A-B family of toxins that exploits retrograde transport as means to gain entry into the cytosol of target cells. JJX 12 consists of RTA-D 10, a camelid <b>single</b> <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> (VHH) antibody directed against an epitope on ricin's enzymatic subunit (RTA), linked via a 15 -mer peptide to RTB-B 7, a VHH against ricin's bivalent galactose binding subunit (RTB). We previously reported that JJX 12, but not an equimolar mixture of RTA-D 10 and RTB-B 7 monomers, was able to passively protect mice against a lethal dose ricin challenge, demonstrating that physically linking RTB-B 7 and RTA-D 10 is critical for toxin-neutralizing activity in vivo. We also reported that JJX 12 promotes aggregation of ricin in solution, presumably through the formation of intermolecular crosslinking. In the current study, we now present evidence that JJX 12 affects the dynamics of ricin uptake and trafficking in human epithelial cells. Confocal microscopy, as well as live cell imaging coupled with endocytosis pathway-specific inhibitors, revealed that JJX 12 -toxin complexes are formed on the surfaces of mammalian cells and internalized via a pathway sensitive to amiloride, a known inhibitor of macropinocytosis. Moreover, in the presence of JJX 12, retrograde transport of ricin to the trans-Golgi network was significantly reduced, while accumulation of the toxin in late endosomes was significantly enhanced. In summary, we propose that JJX 12, by virtue of its ability to crosslink ricin toxin, alters the route of toxin uptake and trafficking within cells...|$|E
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} have revolutionized cancer therapy. However, {{delivery to}} tumor cells in vivo is {{hampered by the}} large size (150 [*]kDa) of conventional antibodies. The minimal target recognition module of a conventional antibody is composed of two non-covalently associated variable domains (VH and VL). The proper orientation of these domains is mediated by their hydrophobic interface and is stabilized by their linkage to disulfide-linked constant domains (CH 1 and CL). VH and VL domains can be fused via a genetic linker into a single-chain variable fragment (scFv). scFv modules in turn can be fused to one another, e. g., to generate a bispecific T-cell engager, or they can be fused in various orientations to antibody hinge and Fc domains to generate bi- and multispecific antibodies. However, the inherent hydrophobic interaction of VH and VL domains limits the stability and solubility of engineered antibodies, often causing aggregation and/or mispairing of V-domains. Nanobodies (15 [*]kDa) and nanobody-based human heavy chain antibodies (75 [*]kDa) can overcome these limitations. Camelids naturally produce antibodies composed only of heavy chains in which the target recognition module is composed of a <b>single</b> <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> (VHH or Nb). Advantageous features of nanobodies include their small size, high solubility, high stability, and excellent tissue penetration in vivo.

Chimeric nanobody-heavy chain antibodies combine advantageous features of nanobodies and human Fc domains in about {{half the size of}} a conventional antibody.

Previously we showed that Nanobodies, i. e. immunoglobulin <b>single</b> <b>variable</b> <b>domains</b> derived from naturally occurring heavy chain-only camelids antibodies, represent new biological tools to efficiently tackle difficult drug targets such as G protein-coupled receptors. In this study we developed and characterized highly selective and potent Nanobodies against CXCR 7.

Several high affinity CXCR 7 -specific Nanobodies potently inhibited CXCL 12 -induced β-arrestin 2 recruitment in vitro. A wide variety of tumor biopsies was profiled, showing {{for the first time}} high expression of CXCR 7 in head and neck cancer. Using a patient-derived CXCR 7 -expressing head and neck cancer xenograft model in nude mice, tumor growth was inhibited by CXCR 7 -targeting Nanobody therapy. Mechanistically, CXCR 7 - targeting Nanobodies did not inhibit cell cycle progression but instead reduced secretion of the angiogenic chemokine CXCL 1 from head and neck cancer cells in vitro, thus acting here as inverse agonists, and subsequent angiogenesis in vivo.

40|$|AbstractThe large {{molecular}} size of antibodies {{is considered}} one major factor preventing them from becoming more efficient therapeutically. It is well established that all camelids have unique antibodies circulating in their blood called heavy-chain antibodies (HcAbs). Unlike antibodies from other species, these HcAbs contain a <b>single</b> <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> and two constant domains (CH 2 and CH 3). HcAbs are a novel type of immunoglobulin-like, antigen binding protein with beneficial pharmacokinetic properties that are ideally suited to targeting cellular antigens for molecular imaging or therapeutic purposes. Since the antigen-binding site of dromedary HcAb is comprised in one single domain, it {{was referred to as}} nanobody. In the present work, the different IgG subclasses from immunized camel (Camelus dromedairus) were purified employing their different affinity for protein A column (PA) and protein G column (PG). Characterization of IgG subclasses was done by using 12 % SDS–PAGE under reducing conditions. Protein bands were visualized after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, showing two bands at 50 kDa and 30 kDa in case of IgG 1 while IgG 2 and IgG 3 produce only one band at 46 kDa and 43 kDa respectively. The induction of apoptosis by either conventional or nanobodies was evaluated on two different cell lines, Colon and Hepatic cancer cell (HCT 116 and HepG 2), using the comet assay. Induced apoptosis were confirmed by visualizing DNA fragmentation bands on 2 % agarose gel, and the gel was photographed under UV light. This study demonstrates the successful targeting of human cancer colon cell lines by nanobodies in vitro. It may open perspectives for their future use as tumor target vehicle, due to their small size, soluble behavior and they interact with epitopes that are less antigenic for conventional antibodies...|$|E

Passive immunization using delivery of antibodies at the mucosal membrane may thus provide a new first line of defense against these pathogens. The objective of this work was to genetically modify Lactobacillus, a natural inhabitant of the gastrointestinal tract, for in situ delivery of passive immunity against gastrointestinal infections. With the aim of identifying colonizing strains of Lactobacillus that could be used vehicle for delivery of passive immunity in the gastrointestinal tract, a collection of ninet three Lactobacillus strains, derived from human fecal samples, was screened for marke for survival and persistence in the gastrointestinal tract (paper I). Five strains show promising results and will be taken forward for testing of survivability in human gut a confirm their safety in human volunteers. A novel expression system for production and delivery of therapeutic molecules in Lactobacillus was constructed based on the framework of the apf gene from L. crispatus. This expression system was tested for delivery of antibody fragments both in a secreted form and cell wall anchored {{on the surface of the}} Lactobacillus. The expression cassettes were stably integrated on the chromosome using the integrase gene from the bacteriophage A 2 to create “food grade” strains of Lactobacillus, devoid of antibiotic markers, for delivery of antibody fragments (paper II). The feasibility of delivering passive immunity against bacterial toxins in the gastrointestinal tract was tested with L. paracasei BL 23 engineered to express a single chain antibody binding the anthrax protective antigen. The engineered Lactobacillus was able to provide protection in mice orally challenged with the anthrax edema toxin, validating the concept of in situ toxin neutralization in the gastrointestinal tract (paper III). Members of the family of Camilidae, to which llamas belong, express a subset of their IgG antibodies as heavy chain only antibodies. Their antigen binding domain is encoded in the <b>single</b> <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> (VHH) that can be produced as a single polypeptide. The VHH has higher acid and proteolytic stability compared to conventional IgG making them ideally suitable for therapeutic use in the gastrointestinal tract. Llamas were immunized with the toxins A and B, the two causative elements of C. difficile associated diarrhea. A range of VHH neutralizing the dominant virulence factor, toxin B, were isolated and cloned for expression in L. paracasei. When expressed either in a secreted or cell wall anchored form, the Lactobacillus produced VHH were able to provide protection against the cytotoxic effects of toxin B. Prophylactic treatment with a combination of two strains of engineered L. paracasei expressing two toxin B neutralizing VHH could delay and provide partial protection against the effect of a toxin B producing strain of C. difficile in an in vivo hamster model (paper IV). In summary this work has shown the potential of using Lactobacillus for the delivery of passive immunity against gastrointestinal infections. Lactobacillus strains colonizing the gastrointestinal tract for delivery of antibody fragments could represent a potential new approach to management of the C. difficile associated diarrhea that could be used both prophylactically or for the prevention of recurrent infections...|$|E
40|$|Antibodies and antibody-fragments {{have emerged}} as {{promising}} tools for many therapeutic and biotechnological applications. Antibody fragments (e. g., scFvs, Fabs, VHHs) derive functionality via their variable domains, which bind to a target (antigen) of interest. Antibody fragments obtained from conventional antibodies (i. e., human or mice IgGs) comprise two chains: variable heavy and variable light. Nanobodies (hereafter VHHs) are unique antibodies found in camelids. VHHs are the smallest naturally occurring binding domains and derive functionality via a <b>single</b> <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> on a heavy chain. Only 3 hypervariable loops (H 1, H 2, H 3) form the antigen-binding surface as opposed to 6 loops in conventional antibody fragments (3 from heavy and 3 from light chain). Due to their small size and surprising ability to bind {{a wide range of}} antigens with high specificity and affinity, VHHs are excellent candidates for antibody engineering. Despite their recent discovery, many engineered VHHs have already entered into clinical trials for treatment of a range of human diseases. It is our aim to rationally engineer VHHs with specificity for a target antigen by tailoring the hypervariable loops. As a first step toward such a goal, the design of loops with a desired conformation was considered. As proof-of-concept and to build our understanding of the binding loops of VHH antibodies, the study focused on the H 1 loop of the anti-human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) llama VHH that exhibits a noncanonical conformation. This loop was redesigned to "tilt" the stability of the loop structure from a noncanonical conformation to a (humanized) type 1 canonical conformation by studying the effect of selected mutations to the amino acid sequence of the H 1, H 2, and proximal residues. To test and extend our understanding of antigen-binding by VHHs, a dual modelingexperimental approach was pursued for designing a VHH specific to Alpha-Synuclein (AS). AS is the main pathological marker and perhaps the causative agent of Parkinson's disease. Starting from an immunized Camelid library against the Non-amyloid component (NAC) region of A 53 T mutant of AS (A 53 T), a bacteria-based selection technique was used to obtain a NAC-specific VHH, followed by computational modeling of the VHH and the VHH-NAC binding. The use of FLITRAP (an E. Coli based high-throughput screening technique) allows us to select for a soluble and intracellularly stable VHH (intrabody). Furthermore, using computational modeling the following tasks were completed: 1) Propose possible conformations of the VHH binding region, 2) Postulate viable modes of VHH binding to the NAC region, 3) Propose mutations that would enhance binding and ultimately, 4) Validate the proposed predictions through experiments. Counterintuitively, it was found that while mutations targeting the central hydrophobic NAC region only led to weak binding affinities, mutations, at the periphery of the binding site, that target the charged flanking hydrophilic residues of NAC are key to substantially increase binding affinity. The main goal of this research was hence to demonstrate the possibility of developing a model of binding in-silico starting from the amino acid sequence of the Antibody and the antigen and using it to predict affinity-enhancing mutations. This work differs from many other structure-based design studies in that the crystal structure of neither the Antibody, the antigen, or the complex is known; it hence tackles a much more challenging (but common) situation. This work also differs from high-throughput screening techniques based on multiple rounds of screening to obtain a high-affinity binder. Our dual experimental-modeling approach can be considered as an important step towards developing rational design strategies based on ab-initio modeling and bottom-up design approaches, which would ultimately enable us to gain a deeper understanding of protein surfaces and interactions. 2021 - 02 - 0...|$|E
40|$|We were {{interested}} in generating an in vivo retroviral gene therapy vector based on the commonly used Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV). This was accomplished by pseudotyping with an engineered influenza A hemagglutinin. Point mutations were introduced to abrogate hemagglutinin's wild type binding and a <b>single</b> chain <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> antibody fragment (scFv) was added to its amino terminus to provide new binding specificity. The engineered hemagglutinin was able to mediate binding of pseudotyped retrovirus to a scFv specific peptide but was unable mediate infection of target cells. To rescue the infectivity of the pseudotyped retrovirus the role of lipid rafts in the lifecycle of the MoMLV was examined. Lipid raft isolation from transfected cells and virus particles revealed that retroviral proteins were not associated with lipid rafts. Using a panel of hemagglutinin mutants with reduced lipid raft affinity we also determined that this parameter did not affect pseudotyping efficiency...|$|R
40|$|<b>Single</b> chain <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> (Fv) {{fragments}} (scFv) {{are powerful}} tools {{in research and}} clinical settings, owing to better pharmacokinetic properties compared to the parent monoclonal antibodies and the relative ease of producing them in large quantities, at low cost. Though they offer several advantages, they suffer from lower binding affinity and rapid clearance from circulation, which limits their therapeutic potential. However, these fragments can be genetically modified to enhance desirable properties, such as multivalency, high target retention and slower blood clearance, and as such, a variety of scFv formats have been generated. ScFvs can be administered by systemic injection for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. They can be expressed in vivo through viral vectors in instances where large infection rates and sustenance of high levels of the antibody is required. ScFvs have found applications as tools for in vivo loss-of-function studies and inactivation of specific protein domains, diagnostic imaging, tumor therapy and treatment for neurodegenerative and infectious diseases. This review will focus on their in vivo applications...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular Antibodies (Intrabodies) are {{engineered}} antibodies (or antibody domains) ectopically {{expressed in}} several cell types to specifically perturb {{the function of}} intracellular antigens. (Biocca & Cattaneo, 1995) Since Antibodies are proteins whose folding depends on the formation of critical disulphide bonds, the successful recognition of the physiological target, located in a reducing environment such as the cytoplasm, is somewhat unpredictable. For this reason, a general and reliable method for the intracellular selection of Intrabodies was developed (Visintin et al, 1999). Based on the two-hybrid assay in yeast, the so-called “IACT” (Intracellular Antibody Capture Technology) allows us to isolate specific intrabodies, from diverse cDNA libraries of antibody domains [either ScFv (<b>Single</b> Chain Fragment <b>Variable</b> <b>domains)</b> or dAbs (<b>single</b> domain antibodies) ] directly in the cytosolic environment, avoiding any protein manipulation and solving the folding problem...|$|R
40|$|Fibrinolysis is {{the process}} of fibrin {{dissolution}} by plasmin. Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI- 1) exert antifibrinolytic properties. TAFI can be activated by thrombin, plasmin or the thrombin/thrombomodulin (T/TM) complex. Upon cleavage, the activation peptide (AP; Phe 1 -Arg 92) is released from the catalytic moiety (CM; Ala 93 -Val 401), forming activated TAFI (TAFIa). TAFIa exerts carboxypeptidase properties and removes C-terminal lysine residues from partially degraded fibrin, abolishing the cofactor function of fibrin on tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) -mediated plasmin generation. PAI- 1 {{is a member of the}} serine protease inhibitor superfamily and is the main inhibitor towards t-PA activity. PAI- 1 interferes with t-PA-mediated plasmin generation by forming an irreversible covalent complex with t-PA. Elevated levels of TAFIa and PAI- 1 are risk factors for various thrombotic events. Both TAFI and PAI- 1 are putative drug targets for the development of profibrinolytic drugs. Design and development of selective inhibitors towards TAFI (including TAFI activation and TAFIa activity) and PAI- 1 as potential profibrinolytic drugs is a promising strategy for the treatment of thrombosis. Nanobodies are <b>single</b> <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> fragments of camel heavy-chain-only antibodies and are often generated in search for new protein-based therapeutics owing to their low immunogenicity, smaller size and high selectivity. In a previous study, a panel of inhibitory nanobodies towards human TAFI was generated and characterized, with diverse inhibitory profiles towards TAFI activation and TAFIa activity. To date, no nanobodies towards PAI- 1 have been reported. Therefore, the aim of this study was to further characterize TAFI, elucidate the molecular mechanisms of TAFI inhibition by TAFI inhibitory nanobodies, and generate inhibitory nanobodies towards PAI- 1. In Chapter 2, we generated a TAFI deletion mutant TAFI-CIIYQ-# 1 - 73 by truncating the first 73 amino acids in the AP of a TAFI stable variant TAFI-CIIYQ, to study the role of the AP in TAFI stability, TAFI activation and TAFIa activity. TAFI-CIIYQ-# 1 - 73 exerted a high intrinsic activity (‘full’ apparent TAFIa activity) without cleavage by TAFI activators and showed a similar functional stability profile to that of TAFI-CIIYQ. TAFI-CIIYQ-# 1 - 73 was cleavable by thrombin and full cleavage by thrombin did not affect the apparent carboxypeptidase activity of TAFI-CIIYQ-# 1 - 73 but resulted in a significant loss of functional stability. These data indicate that the helical segment Ala 74 -Arg 92 in the AP contributes significantly to the role of the activation peptide in stabilization of the catalytic moiety in TAFI zymogen. In addition, the thrombin-mediated cleavage of TAFI-CIIYQ-# 1 - 73 was not accelerated by thrombomodulin, confirming that the AP possesses a thrombomodulin binding site in Phe 1 -Leu 73 which plays an important role in T/TM-mediated TAFI activation. In Chapter 3, we focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms of inhibition by two TAFI inhibitory nanobodies (VHH-a 204 and VHH-i 83) using X-ray crystallography. VHH-a 204 potently inhibits all three modes of TAFI activation, whereas VHH-i 83 interferes only with T/TM-mediated TAFI activation and inhibits TAFIa activity. Crystals of TAFI-CIIYQ in complex with VHH-a 204, VHH-i 83, or VHH-a 204 and VHH-i 83 were grown and optimized. The crystal structure of TAFI/VHH-a 204 complex reveals that VHH-a 204 binds exclusively to the CM, in close proximity to the cleavage site Arg 92 -Ala 93, indicating that VHH-a 204 inhibits TAFI activation by sterically blocking the accessibility of the cleavage site. The crystal structure of TAFI/VHH-i 83 reveals that VHH-i 83 binds to both the AP and the CM. The binding region in the AP involves Arg 12 and is located close to a presumptive TM binding site (Lys 42 -Lys 44), providing a molecular basis for T/TM-mediated activation interference. The structure also suggests that the ability of VHH-i 83 to inhibit TAFIa may be a result of VHH-i 83 bridging the AP to the CM after TAFI activation, which was further confirmed by biochemical assays. The structures of TAFI/VHH-a 204 /VHH-i 83 complex imply the possibility of simultaneous binding of both nanobodies to two different regions on TAFI. In Chapter 4, we reported on the generation of 4 panels of nanobodies (representing 50 clusters in total) from three different libraries and focused on characterizing 6 nanobodies (representing 6 different clusters) that exhibit inhibitory properties towards PAI- 1 activity through 3 different mechanisms. Five nanobodies, VHH-s-a 98, VHH- 2 w- 64, VHH-s-a 27, VHH-s-a 93 and VHH- 2 g- 42, exhibit moderate dose-dependent PAI- 1 inhibition and one nanobody VHH- 2 - 12 inhibits PAI- 1 activity up to only ~ 10 %. VHH-s-a 98 and VHH- 2 w- 64 inhibit PAI- 1 activity by inducing a substrate behavior of PAI- 1 and the epitopes of both nanobodies partially overlap, located within or in the vicinity of the hinge region of αhF. VHH-s-a 93 binds to the hinge region of the reactive center loop and inhibits PAI- 1 activity by directly preventing the initial PAI- 1. t-PA complex formation. VHH-s-a 27 and VHH- 2 g- 42 may inhibit PAI- 1 activity by directly preventing the initial PAI- 1. t-PA complex formation and the epitopes could not be deduced yet. VHH- 2 - 12 binds to the N-terminus and αhD region and slightly accelerates the latency transition. Notably, VHH- 2 - 12 was also able to potentiate the inhibitory effect of VHH- 2 w- 64. In conclusion, this study clarified the role of the AP in TAFI stability and activation, and demonstrated nanobodies as potent, novel inhibitors towards TAFI and PAI- 1. TAFI and PAI- 1 inhibitory nanobodies are potential lead molecules in the development of profibrinolytic therapeutics for the treatment of thrombosis. The availability of TAFI and PAI- 1 inhibitory nanobodies provides the possibility of a dual targeting strategy against TAFI and PAI- 1 using bivalent or multivalent nanobody constructs. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann {{surface area}} (MM/PBSA) method {{was applied to}} the study of the protein-protein complex between a camelid <b>single</b> chain <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> (cAb-Lys 3) and hen egg white lysozyme (HEL), and between cAb-Lys 3 and turkey egg white lysozyme (TEL). The electrostatic energy was estimated by solving the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation. A free energy decomposition scheme was developed to determine binding energy hot spots of each complex. The calculations identified amino acids of the antibody that make important contributions to the interaction with lysozyme. They further showed the influence of small structural variations on the energetics of binding and they showed that the antibody amino acids that make up the hot spots are organized in such a way as to mimic the lysozyme substrate. Through further analysis of the results, we define the concept of "efficient amino acids," which can provide an assessment of the binding potential of a particular hot spot interaction. This information, in turn, can be useful in the rational design of small molecules that mimic the antibody. The implications of using free energy decomposition to identify regions of a protein-protein complex that could be targeted by small molecules inhibitors are discussed...|$|R

The aim {{was to investigate the}} influence of protein fragment format on the kinetics and extent of ocular penetration in vitro. METHODS: Immunoglobulin <b>single</b> chain <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> fragments of a murine monoclonal antibody with specificity for rat CD 4 were engineered with a 20 or 11 amino acid linker by assembly polymerase chain reaction, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by chromatography. Fab fragments of the parental antibody were prepared by papain digestion. Antibody fragments were formulated with a penetration and a viscosity enhancer and were applied to the surface of perfused pig corneas for up to 10 hours in vitro. Penetration was quantified by flow cytometry on rat thymocytes. RESULTS: 20 -mer antibody fragments formed natural monomers and dimers following purification that could be separately isolated, while 11 -mer fragments were dimeric. All formats of fragment (20 -mer monomers and dimers, 11 -mer dimers, Fab) showed penetration through the pig cornea after 6 hours of intermittent topical administration. CONCLUSION: Antibody fragments of different shapes and sizes can penetrate the cornea after topical administration, thereby increasing the potential of this class of proteins for topical ophthalmic use...|$|R

40|$|A structure-based {{approach}} {{was used to}} design libraries of synthetic heavy chain complementarity determining regions (CDRs). The CDR libraries were displayed as either monovalent or bivalent single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) with a <b>single</b> heavy chain <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> scaffold and a fixed light chain <b>variable</b> <b>domain.</b> Using {{the structure of a}} parent antibody as a guide, we restricted library diversity to CDR positions with significant exposure to solvent. We introduced diversity with tailored degenerate codons that ideally only encoded for amino acids commonly observed in natural antibody CDRs.

The libraries were sorted against a panel of pro-teins and yielded multiple unique binding clones against all six antigens tested. The bivalent library yielded numerous unique sequences, while the monovalent library yielded fewer unique clones. Selected scFvs were converted to the Fab format, and the purified Fab proteins retained high affinity for antigen. The results support the view that synthetic heavy chain diversity alone may be sufficient for the generation of high-affinity antibodies from phage-displayed libraries; thus, {{it may be possible to}} dis-pense with the light chain altogether, as is the case in natural camelid immunoglobulins...|$|R
