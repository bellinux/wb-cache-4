50|$|Later Otto engines {{employed}} a small magneto {{directly on the}} engine. Rather than tripping a switch, the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>firing</b> arm applies a quick rotation to the magneto rotor, which then snaps back under spring tension. This quick rotation of the magneto coil produces a very brief current flow that fires the spark plug and ignites the fuel. This design {{has the advantage of}} requiring no external battery, and is how modern portable gas engines operate, incorporating the magnet portion of the magneto into the flywheel. Modern portable engines excite the magneto with every flywheel rotation, and so use a cam-operated electric switch to prevent plug firing except for the power stroke of the engine (see wasted spark).|$|E

The exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping.The 45° design of the engine thus creates a plug firing sequencing as such: The first cylinder fires, the second (rear) cylinder fires 315° later, then there is a 405° gap until the first cylinder fires again, giving the engine its unique sound.|$|E
50|$|Pre-ignition (or preignition) in a {{spark-ignition}} engine is a technically different phenomenon from engine knocking, and describes the event wherein the air/fuel mixture in the cylinder ignites before the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>fires.</b> Pre-ignition is initiated by an ignition source {{other than the}} spark, such as hot spots in the combustion chamber, a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> that runs too hot for the application, or carbonaceous deposits in the combustion chamber heated to incandescence by previous engine combustion events.|$|R
50|$|The P-series {{engine was}} {{introduced}} in the fourth generation Honda Life in September, 2003. The engine uses a single overhead camshaft to drive two valves per cylinder (one intake, one exhaust, for a total of six). It also features the i-DSI ("intelligent dual and sequential ignition") spark ignition system, which utilizes two <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> per cylinder. The <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> <b>fire</b> sequentially, one after the other, in order to more completely burn the fuel charge for more power, lower fuel consumption and lower emissions. Fuel is delivered using Honda's PGM-FI electronic fuel injection system.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>spark</b> <b>plug's</b> <b>firing</b> end will be {{affected}} by the internal environment of the combustion chamber. As the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> can be removed for inspection, the effects of combustion on the plug can be examined. An examination, or [...] "reading" [...] of the characteristic markings on the firing end of the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> can indicate conditions within the running engine. The <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> tip will bear the marks as evidence of what is happening inside the engine. Usually {{there is no other way}} to know what is going on inside an engine running at peak power. Engine and <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> manufacturers will publish information about the characteristic markings in <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> reading charts.Such charts are useful for general use but are of almost no use in reading racing engine <b>spark</b> <b>plugs,</b> which is an entirely different matter.|$|R
50|$|Four-stroke one-cylinder engines {{can be built}} {{without a}} distributor, as in many lawn mowers. The <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> is <b>fired</b> on every stroke, {{resulting}} in a wasted spark in the cylinder when on its exhaust stroke.|$|R
5000|$|Accidents have {{occurred}} during lone pilot hand starting, high throttle settings, brakes not applied or wheel chocks not being used, all resulting in aircraft moving off without the pilot at the controls. [...] "Turning the engine" [...] with {{the ignition and}} switches accidentally left [...] "on" [...] can also cause injury, as the engine can start unexpectedly when a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>fires.</b> If the switch is not in start position, the spark will occur before the piston hits top dead center, which can force the propeller to violently kick back.|$|R
5000|$|The wasted spark {{system is}} an {{ignition}} system {{used in some}} four-stroke cycle internal combustion engines. In a wasted spark system, the <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> <b>fire</b> in pairs, with one plug in a cylinder on its compression stroke and the other plug in a cylinder on its exhaust stroke. The extra spark during the exhaust stroke has no effect and is thus [...] "wasted". This design halves the number of components necessary in a typical ignition system, while the extra spark, against much reduced dielectric resistance, barely impacts the lifespan of modern ignition components. In a typical engine, it requires only about 2-3 kV to fire the cylinder on its exhaust stroke. The remaining coil energy is available to <b>fire</b> the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> in the cylinder on its compression stroke (typically about 8 to 12 kV).|$|R
50|$|Backfires {{may also}} occur before the {{combustion}} chamber. One possible {{cause of this}} is timing. If the timing is too early, the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>fires</b> before the intake valves close, causing the combustion to propagate into the intake manifold, further igniting the air-fuel mixture there; the resulting explosion then travels out of the carburetor and air filter. On many small marine engines, a screen is placed over the intake of the carburetor as a flame arrestor, to prevent these flames from escaping the intake and potentially igniting fuel or fuel vapors in the enclosed sump or bilge of the boat, causing a fire or explosion. Alternatively, the ignition timing may be late, {{in which case the}} combustion is not completed by the time the exhaust valves open, allowing the combustion to propagate into the exhaust system.|$|R
50|$|Since the CDI system only {{provides}} a reduced duration spark, it's {{also possible to}} combine this ignition system with ionization measurement. This is done by connecting a low voltage (about 80 V) to the <b>spark</b> <b>plug,</b> except when <b>fired.</b> The current flow over the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> can then be {{used to calculate the}} temperature and pressure inside the cylinder.|$|R

50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are heat engines, {{and as such}} their theoretical efficiency can be approximated by idealized thermodynamic cycles. The thermal efficiency of a theoretical cycle cannot exceed that of the Carnot cycle, whose efficiency {{is determined by the}} difference between the lower and upper operating temperatures of the engine. The upper operating temperature of an engine is limited by two main factors; the thermal operating limits of the materials, and the auto-ignition resistance of the fuel. All metals and alloys have a thermal operating limit, and there is significant research into ceramic materials that can be made with greater thermal stability and desirable structural properties. Higher thermal stability allows for a greater temperature difference between the lower (ambient) and upper operating temperatures, hence greater thermodynamic efficiency. Also, as the cylinder temperature rises, the engine becomes more prone to auto-ignition. This is caused when the cylinder temperature nears the flash point of the charge. At this point, ignition can spontaneously occur before the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>fires,</b> causing excessive cylinder pressures. Auto-ignition can be mitigated by using fuels with high auto-ignition resistance (octane rating), however it still puts an upper bound on the allowable peak cylinder temperature.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> {{has been}} used as the {{ignition}} source of the spark ignited internal combustion (IC) engine for many decades. It is limited in that once the plug has been built and installed, the ignition location within the cylinder cannot be subsequently changed. Multiple spark ignition of the engine for improved combustion control is possible with a <b>spark</b> <b>plug,</b> but this technology has significant limitations. The large dwell time of the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> makes <b>firing</b> multiple ignitions at different but close crank angles during a cycle impractical. Furthermore, to achieve multiple ignition locations with a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> requires multiple <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> to be installed on each cylinder, which creates severe constraints on the cylinder and valve geometry. The use of a laser as an ignition source however can in principle allow adaptive focusing to allow the on-line change of ignition location {{under the control of the}} Engine Control Unit (ECU) and so effectively remove many of the restrictions of a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> based systems. This paper presents the results of an experimental study on the potential benefits of changing the ignition position in Single Location Ignition (SLI) and the associated laser pulse energy and investigates the prospects of calibrating these parameters to control an engine for improved performance...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to staying below the arcing voltage, the ignition system keep the voltage across the points below the breakdown voltage for an air gap {{to prevent a}} glow discharge across the points. Such a glow discharge would quickly transition to an arc, and the arc would prevent the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> from <b>firing.</b> The minimum voltage for a glow discharge in air is about 320V. Consequently, the capacitor value is chosen to also keep the voltage across the points {{to be less than}} 320V. Keeping the points from arcing when they separate is the reason the ignition coil includes a secondary winding rather than using just a simple inductor. If the transformer has a 100:1 ratio, then the secondary voltage can reach 30kV.|$|R
25|$|Traditional <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> {{need to be}} {{indented}} {{into the}} walls of the combustion chamber to enable the apex of the rotor to sweep past. As the rotor's apex seals pass over the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> hole, a small amount of compressed charge can be lost from the charge chamber to the exhaust chamber, entailing fuel in the exhaust, reducing efficiency, and resulting in higher emissions. These points may be overcome by using laser ignition, eliminating traditional <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> and removing the narrow slit in the motor housing so the rotor apex seals can fully sweep with no loss of compression from adjacent chambers. This concept has a precedent in the glow plug used by Toyota (SAE paper 790435), and the SAE paper 930680, by D. Hixon et al., on 'Catalytic Glow Plugs in the JDTI Stratified Charge Rotary Engine'. The laser <b>plug</b> can <b>fire</b> its <b>spark</b> through the narrow slit. Laser <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> can also <b>fire</b> deep into the combustion chamber using multiple sparks. Direct fuel injection, to which the Wankel engine is suited, combined with laser ignition in single or multiple laser plugs, has been shown to enhance the motor even further reducing the disadvantages.|$|R

50|$|The M278 {{is derived}} from the company's {{previous}} M273 V8 engine, sharing its bore pitch, aluminium engine block, and Silitec aluminium/silicon low-friction cylinder liners. In contrast to the port-injected M273, the M278 features gasoline direct injection, with piezo-electrically actuated fuel injectors for more precise fuel delivery, and multi-spark ignition, which enables the <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> to be <b>fired</b> multiple times over the combustion sequence for more efficient combustion. Other changes relative to the M273 include an increased adjustment range for the variable valve timing system, a new timing chain arrangement, and new engine accessories (such as the oil pump, water pump, fuel pump, and alternator) which reduce parasitic loads. Many of these new features are shared with the M276 V6 engine family, which was announced at the same time.|$|R

40|$|Improvements in engine {{efficiency}} {{are necessary for}} the advancement of modem engine technology. Fuels and lubricants used in internal combustion (IC) engines {{play an important role in}} governing the {{engine efficiency}}. In IC engines some amount of fuel spray can eventually end up on the cylinder liner. This fuel spray mixes with the oil (lubricant) present on the liner. Now the liquid layer on the liner consists of fuel and oil (fuel-oil film is formed) which interacts with the piston rings and the up-scraping of the fuel-oil film can cause the release of oil droplets into the combustion chamber. The released oil droplets lower the self-ignition temperature of the fuel vapor which might lead to pre-ignition. Pre-ignition is a phenomenon in which the fuel vapor ignites before the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>fires</b> causing huge pressure rise which can be detrimental for the engine. The fuel spray on the liner can also pass through the piston rings during the compression stroke and can cause oil dilution in the crank case. The current work is mainly focused on analyzing the fuel-oil interaction on the cylinder liner. A numerical model has been developed in which fuel was modeled as a mixture of 10 hydrocarbon components and oil was modeled as a single n-alkane hydrocarbon. In this model, diffusion in the film, heat transfer in the film, and vaporization at the film-air interface have been coupled. Moving boundary (due to vaporization) was handled by solving the time required to remove the outermost layer while utilizing regular meshing. Implicit method and Newton's iteration method were used to ensure numerical stability and efficiency. Eventually the model calculates the remaining mixture thickness and content before the piston comes back to the specified location in the compression stroke. Some of the main inputs to the model are timing and location of the fuel droplets depositing on the liner, initial fuel film thickness, initial oil film thickness, liner temperature, and cylinder gas pressure. The results showed that with typical engine operational parameters, substantial portion of the initial film mixture still remains when the piston comes back if the initial fuel film thickness is in the range of 20 pm. Further studies were made to examine the consequences of the remaining mixture on the liner. A brief quantitative study was performed to compare the fuel-oil scraped volume and crevice volume. Additionally, the increase in ring-liner contact force due to local oil dilution on the liner was examined using an existing ring-liner lubrication model. by Vinayak Teja Kalva. Thesis: S.
