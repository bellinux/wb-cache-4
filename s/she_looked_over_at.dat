60|$|Julien was {{a little}} staggered. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> him and laughed scornfully.|$|E
60|$|They {{remained}} {{talking on}} the sofa together, while Imogene and Mr. Morton continued to interest themselves in the book. From time to time <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> them, and then turned again to the young clergyman, who, when he had closed the book, rested his hands on its top and began to give an animated account of something, conjecturably his sojourn in Rome.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a thief {{himself and}} just a low-down mischief-maker, for all his smart clo'es, but he knows a {{powerful}} lot {{about what is going}} on in the Green Forest, and perhaps he has seen mah ol' man," [...] said old Mrs. Possum, as she tried to make her sharp face as pleasant as possible. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Sammy Jay, who was in the next tree, and smiled, and when she smiled she showed all her sharp teeth.|$|E
60|$|As {{the girl}} did so <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her hand <b>at</b> me, {{and lifted her}} eyebrows very slightly.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Kybird started. [...] "Ah, and {{we notice}} it too, ma'am, at our age," [...] she said, sweetly, as she settled {{herself in her}} chair and clasped {{her hands in her lap}} [...] "I can't 'elp looking at you, my dear," [...] <b>she</b> continued, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Miss Nugent. [...] "There's such a {{wonderful}} likeness between Jack and you. Don't you think so, ma'am?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Diving {{suddenly}} {{into the}} recesses of something, she produced an exiguous round silver box. Prizing it open, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder <b>at</b> the Bigwigs, then placed her little finger on {{the contents of the}} little box, and said very softly: ...|$|R
50|$|Sister Cantaloupe is {{depicted}} by Jeffrie {{as a product}} of the church. She is a church big mouth and gossip that usually utilizes a cellphone to talk on during her live performances while wearing attire associated with church going women. Jeffrie likens Cantaloupe to one of the former Carol Burnett characters in which Burnett plays an old meddling woman. According to Jeffrie she got the name for Sister Cantaloupe after being asked what her character would be called. She said <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> a fruit bowl and saw a cantaloupe and that's how it came to be. Cantaloupe has made appearances with such notables as the Rhema Conferences and the Bobby Jones Show. She released her first album, Go! Cantaloupe! Go! in 1996, and followed it with 1999's Laffin Out Loud With The Lord.|$|E
50|$|Julia visits Mrs. Rudge in a {{psychiatric}} home. Mrs. Rudge confesses that she killed Olivia after learning of the murder. As Julia leaves <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder <b>at</b> Mrs. Rudge, who sees Olivia's eyes and dies of a fright-induced heart attack.|$|R
6000|$|Obert {{took this}} in; she was convulsed, in the extravagance always so pretty {{as to be}} pardonable, with laughter, and <b>she</b> even <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> us as if to {{intimate}} with her shining, lingering eyes that we wouldn't be surprised at her transports if we suspected what her entertainer, whom she had never known for such a humourist, was saying. Instead of going to find out, all the same, we remained another minute together. It was for me, now, I could see, that Obert had his best attention. [...] "What's the matter with them?" ...|$|R
25|$|He {{is perhaps}} best known for his portraits, and his sitters {{including}} {{some of the most important}} men and women of his time. His portrait of painter Lydia Field Emmet in 1892 depicts Emmet in a pose typically reserved for men in old masters' paintings. Emmet's hand is on her hip and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder <b>at</b> the audience.|$|R
6000|$|They stood there, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{the gate}} <b>at</b> the geraniums. She {{did not ask}} him to come in; but, on the other hand, keeping the gate closed, she made no {{movement}} to leave him. The Casino was now quite out of sight, and the whole place was perfectly still. Suddenly, turning her eyes upon Bernard with a certain strange inconsequence-- ...|$|R
60|$|She had {{proceeded}} {{thus far}} with breathless curiosity and interest, when her attention suddenly failed her. Something--she was too deeply absorbed to know what--had got {{between her and}} the letter. Was it a sound in the Banqueting-Hall again? <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder <b>at</b> the door behind her, and listened. Nothing was to be heard, nothing was to be seen. She returned to the letter.|$|R
6000|$|Discovering {{suddenly}} {{that she was}} standing, he, too, rose and picked up her machine. She took it and wheeled it into the road. Then he took his own. He paused, regarding it. [...] "I say!" [...] said he. [...] "How'd this bike look, now, if it was enamelled grey?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder <b>at</b> his grave face. [...] "Why try and hide it in that way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If that's {{what you}} want it for, don't look on it as a loan, {{take it as a}} gift with my blessing thrown in." [...] <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> Miss Winch, who, the cares of rehearsal being temporarily suspended, was practising golf-shots with an umbrella at {{the other side of the}} stage. [...] "However did you have the sense to fall in love with her, Fill?" ...|$|R
25|$|Next, Satipy {{falls to}} her death in terror from the same cliff while walking with Yahmose. Was it Nofret's vengeful spirit that <b>she</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>over</b> Yahmose's {{shoulder}} moments before her death? The rumours only gather pace when Yahmose and Sobek drink poisoned wine. Sobek dies, but Yahmose lingers on, having drunk less of the wine. A slave boy who says he saw Nofret's ghost poisoning the wine dies of poison shortly afterwards.|$|R
60|$|He was {{surprised}} to find it open. He entered, and quietly closed it behind him. Then he went down the step past the bar-counter, and through to the lighted doorway of the kitchen. There sat his wife, planted in front of the range, where a furze fire was burning. She sat in a chair full in front of the range, her knees wide apart on the fender. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder <b>at</b> him as he entered, but she did not speak. Then she stared in the fire again.|$|R
50|$|The {{central figure}} of The Street Enters the House {{is a woman}} dressed in blue and white, viewed from behind and above. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> her balcony <b>at</b> a busy street scene, a riot of colours, lines, and angles. On {{the road in front}} of her, workers lift poles to form the walls of a new building, {{surrounded}} by a pile of bricks. On every side of this construction, white and blue houses lean into the street. Two of the balconies are occupied by other figures peering down into the road. A line of horses flies past the foreground.|$|R
60|$|Then, for {{the first}} time in their lives, those who were looking on saw Mr. Fentolin apart from his carriage. Without any haste but with amazing strength, Hannah Cox leaned over, and, with her arms around his middle, lifted him sheer up into the air. She carried him, clasped in her arms, a weird, {{struggling}} object, to the clumsy boat that lay always at the top of the beach. She dropped him into the bottom, took her seat, and unshipped the oars. For one moment the coast guardsman hesitated; then he obeyed her look. He gave the boat a push which sent it grinding down the pebbles into the sea. The woman began to work at the oars. Every now and then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder <b>at</b> that thin line of white surf which they were all the time approaching.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} is shot from a first-person perspective. It showcases a girl putting on makeup, then {{being picked up}} by an Uber that takes her to a nightclub. There, she meets Brendon, who fails to flirt with her at first, but the two end up {{drinking}} and dancing together. Instantly, at the line [...] "what are these footprints?/they don't look very human-like," [...] the girl's leg is revealed {{to be a long}} tentacle, but she slaps it and it turns back to a human leg. Urie freaks out and tries to get away from her, but she convinces him that he's hallucinating by making him drink more, {{to the point where he}} can hardly walk, and the girl calls the Uber once again. When they get to the girl's house, the girl furiously rips off Urie's clothes and her own as she throws Urie by her bed. Immediately, the girl's shadow grows into a tentacle-like creature which chases the naked Urie throughout the house. Urie is cornered in the kitchen and attempts to throw a lamp at the creature but fails. The creature ends up catching Urie by the foot, dragging him to the bedroom, running a tentacle through his stomach and throwing him out the window (the shot where <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> the balcony <b>at</b> his body is used for the single cover). The creature jumps down to the spot where Urie lays, devours his body and goes to sleep. When the creature wakes up, it vomits Urie's corpse into a waste bin and takes his form. It puts on his clothes from last night and calls the Uber once again, heading to same nightclub where it begins to flirt with a woman before releasing its tentacles again as the video ends with her screaming.|$|R
60|$|As for the palace, it {{shook and}} trembled with the thunders of applause, still {{led by the}} Giant, who couldn't be stopped. The people about him were all struck deaf in the ear nearest him, but the ear-doctors cured them all for nothing, when they got outside, so full of charity was every one. At last, when every one, the Giant and all, were hoarse with shouting, the Prime Minister offered {{his hand to the}} Queen, and led her down from the throne. Then she motioned to the Prince to give her his arm; and {{at the head of the}} procession, he led her to the royal apartments, at the door of which he left her. The {{multitude}} then dispersed, and they spent the rest of that day in putting right the wrongs they had committed, and in making provision for future virtue. When the Queen had taken some refreshment, she put on an every-day crown, and repaired to the audience chamber to receive the visits of the various dignitaries of the kingdom, who came before her, and brought her their keys, and papers, and account-books. Giving each one back his keys, and ordering the papers and accounts to be deposited in a great pile on one side, where <b>she</b> might <b>look</b> <b>over</b> them <b>at</b> her leisure, she reappointed every man to the office he held before, and sent them away rejoicing. Then she called for writing materials and slaves, and commenced writing notes to the Prince. She would write one on gilded vellum, and, folding it, would hand it to the slave next to her, who dipped it in frankincense, and handed it to the next one, who sprinkled it with attar of roses, and passed it to the next, who ran with it as hard as ever he could to the Prince. For in that kingdom it was not considered proper for lovers to visit much.|$|R
6000|$|... "This weather {{makes me}} {{long for the}} country," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> the back view of tall houses through the window.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Regarde, regarde ces gens-la! Ne sont-ils pas des hiboux incroyables?' And {{with the}} words of French in her mouth, <b>she</b> would <b>look</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> the giggling party.|$|R
60|$|He {{took some}} loose pages {{up in his}} hand. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Anna did not pause, but <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} with slightly lifted eyebrows.|$|R
60|$|He {{handed her}} the letter she had written and left on the table <b>at</b> Mrs. Jethway's. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> it vacantly.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{a corner}} of the old grassy ditch, just where the marsh and the yellow flowers came nearest to it.|$|R
60|$|Priscilla stood {{quiet for}} a minute. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> the crowd, and then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at the poor Hof-rath, who now began {{to show that he}} was a little frightened.|$|R
6000|$|His wife overheard him and pausing in her task of {{refilling}} {{the glasses}} {{for the rich}} man's party <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder and said: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> it carefully, {{and as the}} {{ten minutes}} had passed without sign of the governess's return, asked what {{naturally}} followed in the morning's employment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you ridiculous child!" [...] {{observed}} Mrs. Jellyby with an abstracted air as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{the dispatch}} last opened; [...] "what a goose you are!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{detected}} {{the anguish of}} a slow mind with an instinctive dread of obscure places wherein new discoveries can be made. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder to say: ...|$|R
60|$|Ellen posted her letter. She {{dropped it}} into the box thoughtfully, and thoughtfully {{returned}} to the flat. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder, but Constable Plimmer was out of sight.|$|R
60|$|What was he doing? <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} upon the paper, and saw figures and signs. When he had jotted down something {{he went to}} the telescope again.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{the crowd}} with flaming audacity and stepped down. At Tommy’s request she stood upon the chair again, while he mounted the second chair and started the bidding.|$|R
60|$|She {{permitted}} {{herself to}} go to a motion-picture show. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> all the posters in front of the theater, and a train-wreck, a seaside love-scene, a detective drama, all invited her.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} {{anything}} that could be altered," [...] Mrs. Harvey said, [...] "I have a dressmaker in the house now. She could easily do what you need. <b>She's</b> <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> my wardrobe." ...|$|R
