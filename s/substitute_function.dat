40|$|Salmonella typhimurium {{is able to}} {{synthesize}} cobalamin (B 12) under anaerobic growth conditions. The previously described cobalamin biosynthetic mutations (phenotypic classes CobI, CobII, and CobIII) map in three operons located near the his locus (minute 41). A new class of mutant (CobIV) defective in B 12 biosynthesis was isolated and characterized. These mutations map between the cysB and trp loci (minute 34) and define a new genetic locus, cobA. The anaerobic phenotype of cobA mutants suggests an early block in corrin ring formation; mutants failed {{to synthesize}} cobalamin de novo but did so when the corrin ring is provided as cobyric acid dicyanide or as cobinamide dicyanide. Under aerobic conditions, cobA mutants were unable to convert either cobyric acid dicyanide or cobinamide dicyanide to cobalamin but could use adenosylcobyric acid or adenosylcobinamide as a precursor; {{this suggests that the}} mutants are unable to adenosylate exogenous corrinoids. To explain the anaerobic CobI phenotype of a cobA mutant, we propose that the cobA gene product catalyzes adenosylation of an early intermediate in the de novo B 12 pathway and also adenosylates exogenous corrinoids. Under anaerobic conditions, a <b>substitute</b> <b>function,</b> known to be encoded in the main Cob operons, is induced; this <b>substitute</b> <b>function</b> can adenosylate exogenous cobyric acid and cobinamide but not the early biosynthetic intermediate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} vessel capacity utilisation in Scandinavian ferry services and describe reasons for the levels of resource utilisation that the study reveals. The paper relies upon goods and passenger statistics for a number of ferry services that operate within and to/from Sweden, Denmark and Norway. The empirical outcome shows that the average utilisation of the vessels is 33, 4 % and proves that there are considerable imbalances and variations in goods and passenger flows. Furthermore there is a relationship between vessel capacity utilisation and frequency: the utilisation is significant lower for routes with high frequency. This relationship between capacity utilisation and requency is further analysed. The paper focuses in particular on ferry services with high frequency that often fulfil the same function as a bridge, and on the understanding of the variables defining this “bridge substitute”. The bridge <b>substitute</b> <b>function</b> requires accessibility, high frequency and excess capacity in order to reduce the total transport time for the goods and the vehicles by minimise the waiting time in port.

Subjects: All patients admitted during the 12 months between 1 June 1999 and 1 June 2000. Main outcome measures: Patients' health-related quality of life (Medical Outcome Study 36 -item Short Form Health Survey, Groningen Activities Restriction Scale), GPs assessments of severity of illness (DUSOI/WONCA Severity of Illness checklist) and alternative modes of care. Results: In total, 218 admissions were recorded beds (n= 62) and nursing home beds (n= 25). The mean age of all patients was 76 years. Main reasons for admission were immobilization due to trauma at home (GP beds), rehabilitation from surgery (rehabilitation beds) and stroke (nursing home beds). Overall, patients showed a poor health-related quality of life on admission. If the GP beds had not been available, the GPs estimated that the admissions would have been almost equally divided among home care, nursing home and hospital care. The severity of the diagnosis on admission of the 'hospital-care group' appeared to be significant higher than the other care groups. Conclusion: The GP hospital appears to provide a valuable alternative to home care, nursing home care and hospital care, especially for elderly patients with a poor health-related quality of life who are in need of short medical and nursing care.

40|$|Life cycle {{management}} has often {{paid more attention}} to environmental impacts of products than services. In this paper, we devote more attention to evaluating environmental impacts of product-services by investigating community-based services (CBS). Since they are provided close to the end-consumer, CBS have a strong role in shaping consumption patterns and a certain potential in reducing associated environmental impacts. The study aims at investigating the institutional framework and the potential for reducing life cycle impacts through development and provision of community-based services that <b>substitute</b> <b>function</b> delivery by a single product. In order to fulfil this goal, a case of community-based washing centres in Sweden is studied from historical, institutional and business perspectives and environmental outcomes of CBS are qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated. The design of the services is discussed following the product service systems framework. The results show that assuming the same behaviour in both cases, community-based washing centres have lower resource consumption, which stems from high performance characteristics of the installed equipment. The study also estimates the total saving on national level from using shared washing facilities. However, it is demonstrated that behavioural aspects are very important in determining the environmental soundness of service solutions. The paper proposes that energy savings could be even larger if the laundry services would be provided by businesses and/or the users would be better informed about optimisation possibilities of their washing operations. A number of recommendations are also provided on how energy consumption of washing activity can be reduced. Finally, the paper discussed the importance of specific policy interventions in developing more sustainable services...|$|E
40|$|This article explores public voice {{formation}} {{and its potential}} impact on EU constitution making. A comprehensive perspective is introduced which analyzes the constitutionalization of the EU as a simultaneous and interacting process of polity building and constituency building. The EU’s social constituency {{is referred to as}} a particular constellation of public voice and resonance in the media in relation to European constitution making. Mass media are analyzed as the principal arena for amplifying ‘constitutional voice’ in the member states. Starting from a comparative outline of constitutional claims-making in quality newspapers in France and Germany between 2001 and 2005, the article focuses on ratification as a period of intense politicization on EU constitutional affairs. The article systematically compares how the signal for participation in the ratification process is taken up and transformed into plural voices and debates, and what kind of concerns and demands are put forward by different actors and affected parties within such debates. Finally, justificatory practices of defending particular visions of the EU as a legitimate order will be categorized. The main findings point to a domestically focused French media sphere in which the constitutional debate turned into a prime example of ‘contentious politics’. In contrast, German media took the position of an alert but passive observer of the debates in other member states. In this sense, the French debate assumed, at least partially, a <b>substitute</b> <b>function</b> in the German media. _This article has been published in Journal of European Public Policy Vol. 16, No. 3, pp. 412 - 430...|$|E

Irreversible ischaemic liver failure was induced in anaesthetised pigs, after portal-systemic-shunt, by hepatic-artery-ligation. Biochemical parameters, intracranial pressure, and functional-clotting were measured in animals connected in an extracorporeal bioartificial-liver circuit. Efficacy was demonstrated comparing outcomes between animals connected to a circuit containing alginate-encapsulated cells (Cell-bead BAL), and those connected to circuit containing alginate capsules without cells (Empty-bead BAL). Cells of the biomass met regulatory standards for sterility and provenance. All animals developed progressive liver-failure after ischaemia induction. Efficacy of BAL was demonstrated since animals connected to a functional biomass (+ cells) had significantly smaller rises in intracranial pressure, lower ammonia levels, more bilirubin conjugation, improved acidosis and clotting restoration compared to animals connected to the circuit without cells. In the +cell group, human proteins accumulated in pigs' plasma. Delivery of biomass using a short-term cold-chain enabled transport and use without loss of function over 3 days. Thus, a fluidised-bed bioreactor containing alginate-encapsulated HepG 2 cell-spheroids improved important parameters of acute liver failure in pigs.

The classical Shepard operator reconstructs an unknown function as a normalized blend of the function values at the scattered points, using the inverse distances to the scattered points as weight functions. Based on the general idea of defining interpolants by convex combinations, Little suggests to extend the bivariate Shepard operator in two ways. On the one hand, he considers a triangulation of the scattered points and <b>substitutes</b> <b>function</b> values with linear polynomials which locally interpolate the given data at the vertices of each triangle. On the other hand, he modifies the classical point-based weight functions and defines instead a normalized blend of the locally interpolating polynomials with triangle-based weight functions which depend on the product of inverse distances to the three vertices of the corresponding triangle. The resulting triangular Shepard operator interpolates all data required for its definition and reproduces polynomials up to degree 1, whereas the classical Shepard operator reproduces only constants.

Since one of the main functions of onco-suppressers is to mediate cell cycle arrest via modification of cyclin dependent kinases activity, the compounds with ability to <b>substitute</b> altered <b>functions</b> of these genes in neoplastic cells are the most promising. Synthetic inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases are typical representatives of such drugs. Olomoucine, flavopiridol, butyrolactone I and their derivatives selectively inhibit CDKs and thus constrain tumor cell proliferation under in vitro and/or in vivo conditions. We made original discovery of OC and its inhibitory activity toward the CDK 1 family of CDKs and recently reported apoptosis induction and tumor regression following OC application. Moreover, the OC family of synthetic CDKIs has the capacity to directly inhibit CDK 7, the principal enzyme required for activating other CDKs, and thus these compounds are the first known CDK 7 inhibitors.
