5000|$|All Deists {{were in fact}} both {{critical}} and constructive Deists. All sought to destroy in order to build, and reasoned either from the absurdity of Christianity {{to the need for}} a new philosophy or from their desire for a new philosophy to the absurdity of Christianity. Each Deist, to be sure, had his <b>special</b> <b>competence.</b> While one specialized in abusing priests, another specialized in rhapsodies to nature, and a third specialized in the skeptical reading of sacred documents. Yet whatever strength the movement had—and it was at times formidable—it derived that strength from a peculiar combination of {{critical and}} constructive elements. Peter Gay, Deism: An Anthology, p. 13 It should be noted, however, that the constructive element of deism was not unique to deism. It was the same as the natural theology that was so prevalent in all English theology in the 17th and 18th centuries. What set deists apart from their more orthodox contemporaries were their critical concerns.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the offices}} that Pope Sixtus V {{classified}} as vacabili were {{of minor importance}} and therefore did not require <b>special</b> <b>competence</b> were sold with a grant {{of the right of}} succession to the heirs of the purchaser. Offices that entailed grave obligations and for which only pious and learned men were eligible were sold without this right and therefore reverted to the Roman Curia on the death of the purchaser. An aleatory contract, therefore, was formed, its uncertainties being the amount of the income of the office and the length {{of the life of the}} purchaser. The prices of the offices, especially of the more desirable ones, were considerable: Lorenzo Corsini, afterwards Pope Clement XII, bought the office of Regent of the Cancellaria for 30,000 Roman scudi, a large fortune at the time. The disadvantage of these uncertainties might not be confined to the purchaser because he was free to condition the purchased office on the life of another designated person, named the [...] "intestatary". The purchaser was also permitted to substitute a different intestatary if this substitution was expressed 40 days before the death of the immediately preceding intestatary.|$|E

5000|$|The dogs used in {{the first}} study were re-tested using the same {{procedures}} {{in order to assess}} the long-term impact of the training on their reaction to sheep. [...] Again, in the free-running tests the dogs were fitted with a shock collar, which was used to deter approaches to within 1-2m of the sheep. Dogs that had previously been shocked in year 1 showed a significant increased in latency to approach a person during the path test (p<0.001), even though this was not a condition under which shocks had been delivered. Owners reported behavioral differences between year 1 and 2 in 24 of the dogs. 18 of the 24 dogs had shown no interest in sheep during that period, even though they had been interested in them during the first year tests. However, only one of those dogs had received shocks, so the change in behaviour could not be attributed {{to the use of the}} shock collar. When comparing owners’ reports for the two years, the dogs showed a weaker inclination for chasing sheep and other prey than previously (p < 0:001), but this variable was not affected by shock experience. Dogs that had shown interest in sheep in year 1 showed a persistent interest in year 2. No dogs chased or attacked sheep as their first response, while half of them did so the first year. During the entire test period, the proportion of dogs attacking sheep was reduced to almost one fourth. The number of shocks administered per dog was reduced by the second year, and only one of the dogs which received el. shocks the first year needed el. shocks also the second year.The observations that both receivers and non-receivers of el. shocks the first year showed a reduction in the probability of chasing sheep, but the receivers showing a larger reduction, show that el. shock treatment provides an additional learning response. No adverse effects on the dogs were observed with this training procedure, but in their discussion the authors commented [...] "In order to ensure no negative effects, we recommend that the electronic dog collar may be used for such purposes only if it is used by skilled trainers with <b>special</b> <b>competence</b> on dog behaviour, learning mechanisms, and of this particular device." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to look at the {{experiences}} of midwives in maternalhealth care encounters with non-european-born women and men, and to determine ifmidwives deem any <b>special</b> <b>competence</b> necessary to handle these encounters well. We gathered information by means of qualitative interviews and semi structuredquestions with eight midwives all of whom matched the inclusion criterias and gavetheir personal consent. Midwives from four district health care centers in Uppsalawere included. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed by means of qualitativecontent analysis. The results reveal the experiences from encounters with non-european patients to betwofold. On one hand the encounter is a positive, exiting experience with anopportunity to learn more about a foreign culture and exchange experiences. On theother hand complications can occur as patients may have unexpected expectationsregarding the health care, have great difficulties with the language or haveexperienced traumatizing incidents, all on top of coming to Sweden alone withoutrelatives. In the encounter with non-european-born patients the midwives consider it importantto have <b>special</b> <b>competence</b> in form of knowledge of other cultures and religions asthis provides a greater understanding of the reasoning behind the patients’ decisions. Cultural competence is also important as it helps avoid inadvertently insulting thepatient during the encounter. The <b>special</b> <b>competence</b> held by the midwives has been attained from their basic andspecialist education as well as from self acquired experiences and interests. A lifelongeducation is required to uphold this competence as well as a dialog betweenmidwives at the health care clinic...|$|E
