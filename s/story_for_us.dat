2500|$|Creative {{director}} Chris Metzen {{noted that}} {{to avoid the}} same failure that Titan became, their group had to rethink how Blizzard's more successful games had come about, ignoring the scale and business opportunity of the end result and instead understand what tools and skills they had already to build from. [...] In brainstorming ideas, the team thought about {{the current state of}} first-person shooters (FPS), a genre that many on the team had played throughout their careers, which has enjoyed many groundbreaking titles but still has a potential for innovation, according to Kaplan. Kaplan stated that some of the ideas in the current FPS they wanted to emulate were the use of in-game maneuvers like rocket jumping and grappling hooks that helped players move with fluidity across maps and team-based shooters such as Team Fortress Classic and Team Fortress 2. At the same time, multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games were starting to take off, which required players to cooperate with others to successfully win the match. Kaplan said that their team considered how to adapt the large-scale and fast-paced gameplay of Team Fortress 2 with the smaller scale and cooperative nature of MOBAs, forming the basis of Overwatch. Metzen also commented that the concept of teamwork in Overwatch was partially influenced by their own team's current morale following the cancellation of Titan. Metzen said that during Titans development, the team was highly fractured which impacted the project's cancellation. On starting Overwatch with a smaller group, they all wanted to come together and support each other to make their next game a success, [...] "a redemption <b>story</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> as people and as craftsmen". Morhaime described Overwatchs intention as to [...] "create an awesome [...] experience that's more accessible to a much wider audience while delivering the action and depth that shooter fans love." [...] On the FPS nature of the game, Kaplan commented that [...] "the real focus of the shooting in the game is not to chase realism. We don't have real world guns in the game. You're not playing a soldier in a present-day military conflict." [...] Simplicity of design was a high-value goal, taking cues from the success of the simple approach used in Blizzard's Hearthstone.|$|E
