The flight begin as any other however fire suddenly seemed to engulf the plane from nose to tail when they had only reached an altitude of about 150 feet. Turner immediately banked steeply to return to the field for an emergency landing. The two passengers opened the <b>side</b> <b>compartment</b> door and jumped from the plane before it had come to a stop. Turner opened the top hatch to leave the cockpit but the flames prevented him making his escape. He then opened the cockpit side door and jumped, spraining his ankle due to the height of the jump. Due to the fire around him Turner was unable to use the specially placed footholds for climbing in and out of the cockpit. He ran to get his passengers out, finding they had made their escape he entered the passenger compartment and grabbed the sacks of mail. Shortly after Turner left the plane the gasoline tank in one of the wings exploded. The three men escaped with their lives and were transported to the hospital. Turner left the hospital immediately after burns on his hands were treated. Brock had abrasions on his hands and burns on his neck. Staulter was treated for burns on the face and hands and dislocated shoulder. Brock and Staulter remained in the hospital.

40|$|The {{performances}} of electrodialysis (ED) and reverse electrodialysis (RED) processes depend on several factors, including {{the nature of}} the electrode material and of the redox couple adopted to make possible the conversion between electric power and chemical potential. In this paper, the possible utilization of iron-based redox couples (FeCl 3 /FeCl 2, hexacyanoferrate(III) /hexacyanoferrate(II) and Fe(III) -EDTA/Fe(II) -EDTA) on graphite and DSA electrodes for RED processes was studied by a detailed experimental investigation. The hexacyanoferrate(III) /hexacyanoferrate(II) system was stable for lonf time (more than 12 days) in the absence of light and oxygen at high redox couple concentrations and low current densities both at compact graphite and DSA electrodes. Perfluorinated Nafion cationic membranes were found to be impermeable to the components of the redox couple. Fe(II) -EDTA exhibited a limited electrochemical stability in long term electrolyses at all adopted operative conditions, which discourages the use of the Fe(III) -EDTA/Fe(II) -EDTA for RED applications. The FeCl 3 /FeCl 2 system was, on the other hand, stable for long times (more than 12 days) at acidic pH at compact graphite electrodes. Selemion anionic membranes allowed to confine the redox couple in the electrode compartments with very slow passage of protons to the <b>side</b> <b>compartment</b> (“dilute or concentrated compartment”) ...|$|E

40|$|In reverse {{electrodialysis}} (RED) processes, electrical energy is directly extracted from chemical potential gradients arising from salinity differences, especially from sea and river water. In RED {{there are at}} least four complementary elements: (1) electrodes, where electron transfer reactions occur to allow the transformation of the charge carrier from ion to electron; (2) ion selective exchange membranes, which allow the selective transport of ions; (3) solvents, which make a continuum for ion transport; (4) electrolytes, i. e. the current carriers between cathode and anode. Studies on RED processes were mainly focused on membranes but also on several other aspects including electrolyte compositions and concentration, modeling and fluidodynamics. Less attention has been given to the selection of the electrodic material-redox couple system (for the purpose of this work defined electrode system) with very few exceptions, the most relevant being a very recent paper of Veerman and co-authors that carried out a very detailed comparative assessment of the suitability for RED of selected electrode systems described in literature [1]. On the other hand, the behavior of these systems was rarely experimentally investigated under operative conditions of interest for RED or electrodialysis (ED) applications. Electrode systems can be grouped in two categories: with or without opposite electrode reactions [1]. In the first case, when recirculation of electrode rinse solution is adopted, no net modification of the chemical composition occurs and the electrodic thermodynamic voltage is null. The opposite electrode reactions can involve reactive electrodes such as in the systems Cu-CuSO 4, Ag-AgCl, Zn-ZnCl 2 or homogeneous redox couples with inert electrodes [1]. This work was devoted {{to the study of the}} utilization of iron based redox couples FeCl 3 /FeCl 2, Hexacyanoferrate(III) /Hexacyanoferrate(II) and Fe(III) EDTA/Fe(II) EDTA on graphite and DSA electrodes for RED processes. To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of these processes, numerous experiments were carried out in undivided and divided cells and in stack for the generation of energy. The Hexacyanoferrate(III) /Hexacyanoferrate(II) system was stable for long times in the absence of light and oxygen at high redox couple concentrations and low current densities both at compact graphite and DSA electrodes. Perfluorinated Nafion cationic membranes were found to be impermeable to the components of the redox couple. Fe(II) EDTA exhibited a limited electrochemical stability in long term electrolyses at all adopted operative conditions, that discourages the use of the Fe(III) EDTA/Fe(II) EDTA for RED applications.
