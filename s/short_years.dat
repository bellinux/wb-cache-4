About 20% of the Hakka population was executed or worked to death by Mao in Southern Jiangxi, nearly the same percentage of Hakkas were put to death in the same brutal way in Tingzhou of Fujian as well within just a few <b>short</b> <b>years</b> of this communist purge.|$|E

These new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records.

25|$|The {{strongly}} Confucian Heungseon Daewongun {{proved to}} be a wise and calculating leader {{in the early years of}} Gojong's reign. He abolished the old government institutions that had become corrupt under the rule of various clans, revised the law codes along with the household laws of the royal court and the rules of court ritual, and heavily reformed the military techniques of the royal armies. Within a few <b>short</b> <b>years</b> he was able to secure complete control of the court, and eventually receive the submission of the Pungyang Jos while successfully disposing of the last of the Andong Kims, whose corruption, he believed, was responsible for ruining the country.|$|E
50|$|In England and Wales, {{the legal}} year 1751 was a <b>short</b> <b>year</b> of 282 days, running from 25 March to 31 December. 1752 began on 1 January. To align the {{calendar}} {{in use in}} England to that on the continent, the Gregorian calendar was adopted: and the calendar was advanced by 11 days: Wednesday 2 September 1752 was followed by Thursday 14 September 1752.

25|$|The {{reign of}} shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi after the {{deposition}} of Mossadegh in 1953, {{was the most}} prosperous era for the Jews of Iran. In the 1970s, only 10 percent of Iranian Jews were classified as impoverished; 80 percent were middle class and 10 percent wealthy. Although Jews accounted for {{only a small percentage}} of Iran's population, in 1979 two of the 18 members of the Iranian Academy of Sciences, 80 of the 4,000 university lecturers, and 600 of the 10,000 physicians in Iran were Jews. An important factor in economic improvement of the Jews was close relations between the Shah and the state of Israel. Details of this connection and how the condition of Iranian Jews improved dramatically in a few <b>short</b> <b>years</b> still awaits rigorous exploration.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{the death}} of Dost Muhammad in 1863, he was succeeded by his son, Sher Ali Khan. However, three years later, his older brother Mohammad Afzal Khan overthrew him. In 1868, Mohammad Afzal Khan was himself overthrown and {{replaced}} as Emir by Sher Ali, who returned to the Throne. Sher Ali had spent his few <b>short</b> <b>years</b> in exile in Russia. His return as Emir led to new conflicts with Britain. Subsequently, the British marched on 21 November 1878 into Afghanistan and Emir Sher Ali was forced to flee again to Russia, but he died in 1879 in Mazar-i-Sharif. His successor, Mohammad Yaqub Khan, sought solutions for peace with Russia and gave them a greater say in Afghanistan's foreign policy. However, when the British envoy Sir Louis Cavagnari was killed in Kabul on the 3 September 1879, the British offered to accept Abdur Rahman Khan as Emir. The British concluded a peace treaty with the Afghans in 1880, and withdrew again in 1881 from Afghanistan. The British in 1893 forced Afghanistan to consent to the Durand Line, which is still straight through the settlement area of the Pashtuns runs and {{about a third of}} Afghanistan to British India annexing.|$|E

Visual improvements were noted on games such as Fallout 4 and Rise of the Tomb Raider when upscaled to 4K.

50|$|Most Western European {{countries}} {{changed the}} start of the year to 1 January before they adopted the Gregorian calendar.
