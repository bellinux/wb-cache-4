2500|$|At {{the time}} of its entry into the war, the United States Army Air Service lacked any {{aircraft}} suitable for front line combat. It therefore procured various aircraft from the British and French, one being the DH.4. As the DH-4, it was manufactured mostly by Dayton-Wright and Fisher Body for service with the United States from 1918, the first American built DH-4 being delivered to France in May 1918, with combat operations commencing in August 1918. The powerplant was a Liberty L-12 of 400hp (300kW) and it was fitted with two [...]30in (7.62mm) Marlin (a development of the Colt-Browning) machine guns in the nose and two [...]30in (7.62mm) Lewis guns in the rear and could carry 322lb (146kg) of bombs. it could also be equipped with various radios like the SCR-68 for artillery spotting missions. The heavier engine reduced performance compared with the Rolls-Royce powered version, but as the [...] "Liberty Plane" [...] it became the US Army Air <b>Service</b> <b>standard</b> general purpose two-seater, and on the whole was fairly popular with its crews.|$|E

40|$|When private {{goods are}} {{publicly}} provided at subsidized prices, government authorities {{have to determine}} the distribution of services on recipients. Such distributions are commonly based on legal regulations and professional guidelines. Thus governments are assumed to develop <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> that are incorporated in the preferences for allocation of services. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyse the behavior of local governments when they are allocating home-care services on elderly and disabled clients. Based on Norwegian data it is demonstrated that <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> as well as economic constraints have an impact on the supply of home-care. As expected the supply to individual clients increases with the degree of disablement. The model estimates also show that <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> vary substantially between different client groups. For instance, service levels for mentally retarded are rather high compared to elderly clients in non-single households. Individual <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> are derived from observed behavior by means of model simulation, where the standards are defined for an average level of municipal incomes and prices. The results are used to evaluate the degree of mismatch between service supply and common <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> in different local communities.
