50|$|SiAlONs are {{ceramics}} {{based on}} the elements silicon (Si), aluminium (Al), oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N). They are solid solution of silicon nitride (Si3N4) and exist in three basic forms. Each form is iso-structural {{with one of the}} two common forms of silicon nitride, beta and alpha and with silicon oxynitride. The relationship between that of <b>sialon</b> and silicon nitride is similar to that between brass and pure copper. The later case, copper atoms are replaced by zinc to give a stronger alloy than the mother metal. In the case of <b>sialon,</b> there is substitution of silicon by aluminium with corresponding atomic replacement of nitrogen by oxygen, to satisfy valency requirements. The resulting 'solution' (<b>sialon)</b> has superior properties to the original pure solvent (silicon nitride).|$|E

With SrCO 3 as an additional starting material this procedure has now been extended to the synthesis of oxonitridosilicates and oxonitridoaluminosilicates (<b>sialons).</b> Two novel <b>sialons</b> SrSiAl 2 O 3 N 2 [space group P 21 21 21 (no. 19), a= 491. 89 (6), b= 789. 73 (7), c= 1134. 94 (18) pm, Z= 4] and SrErSiAl 3 O 3 N 4 [space group P 63 mc (no. 186), a= 606. 53 (3), c= 985. 90 (8) pm, Z= 2] have been obtained as coarsely crystalline materials.

40|$|Alumina based {{ceramics}} {{have important}} engineering applications {{due to their}} good physicochemical properties but their performance may be enhanced by addition of a second phase. Aluminosilicates as andalusite submitted to aluminium reduction and the simultaneous nitriding (N 2 atmosphere) leads to the obtention of alumina and phases of the Si-Al-O-N system. These phases are of great interest for structural ceramics. Mixes prepared with andalusite and Al° (different content) were treated with N 2 up to 1550 °C., using a heating rate of 5 °/min. Thermal effects (DTA) and weight changes (TG, DTG) of nitriding reactions during heating were evaluated. The reaction mechanism was determined using DTA-TG-DTG techniques. Results indicate that Si° and AlN are important intermediate phases during reactions.

Europium(II)-doped β-SiAlON absorbs in ultraviolet and visible light spectrum and emits intense broadband visible emission. Its luminance and color does not change significantly with temperature, due to the temperature-stable crystal structure. It has a great potential as a green down-conversion phosphor for white LEDs; a yellow variant also exists.

Using metal powder, the conductivity of the mold is ideal for fast heating of the work-piece. Molds with a large diameter and relatively small height can be heated quickly.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this review {{is to examine the}} {{development}} of silicon nitride and the related <b>sialons</b> and their processing into a range of high-grade structural ceramic materials. Design/methodology/approach: Silicon nitride {{is one of the major}} structural ceramics that possesses high flexural strength, good fracture resistance, good creep resistance and high hardness. These properties arise because of the processing route which involves liquid phase sintering and the development of microstructures in which high aspect ratio grains and intergranular glass phase lead to excellent fracture toughness and high strengthFindings: This review has examined the development of silicon nitride and the related <b>sialons</b> and their processing into a “family” of structural ceramic materials with high hardness, strength, fracture toughness, creeo resistance and wear resistance. Practical implications: The development of knowledge of microstructure–property relationships in silicon nitride materials is outlined, particularly recent advances in understanding of the effects of grain boundary chemistry and structure on mechanical properties.

5000|$|<b>SiAlONs</b> are {{produced}} by first combining a mixture of raw materials including silicon nitride, alumina, aluminium nitride, silica and the oxide of a rare-earth element such as yttrium. The powder mix is fabricated into a [...] "green" [...] compact by isostatic powder compaction or slipcasting, for example. Then the shaped form is densified, typically by pressureless sintering or hot isostatic pressing. The sintered part may then need to be machined by diamond grinding (abrasive cutting).|$|R
5000|$|The term {{is derived}} from the Greek words <b>sialon</b> (saliva) and lithos (stone), and the Latin -iasis meaning [...] "process" [...] or [...] "morbid condition". A {{calculus}} (plural calculi) is a hard, stone-like concretion that forms within an organ or duct inside the body. They are usually made from mineral salts, and other types of calculi include tonsiloliths (tonsil stones) and renal calculi (kidney stones). Sialolithiasis refers to the formation of calculi within a salivary gland. If a calculus forms in the duct that drains the saliva from a salivary gland into the mouth, then saliva will be trapped in the gland. This may cause painful swelling and inflammation of the gland. Inflammation of a salivary gland is termed sialadenitis. Inflammation associated with blockage of the duct is sometimes termed [...] "obstructive sialadenitis". Because saliva is stimulated to flow more with the thought, sight or smell of food, or with chewing, pain and swelling will often get suddenly worse just before and during a meal ("peri-prandial"), and then slowly decrease after eating, this is termed meal time syndrome. However, calculi are not the only reasons that a salivary gland may become blocked and give rise to the meal time syndrome. Obstructive salivary gland disease, or obstructive sialadenitis, may also occur due to fibromucinous plugs, duct stenosis, foreign bodies, anatomic variations, or malformations of the duct system leading to a mechanical obstruction associated with stasis of saliva in the duct.|$|E

40|$|The {{reason for}} {{introducing}} a composite as an interlayer {{is because it}} can improve the fracture toughness of the <b>sialon</b> and also give an intermediate coefficient of expansion between <b>sialon</b> and steel.
