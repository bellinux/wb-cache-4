50|$|Layered or {{stratified}} {{charge storage}} is {{hot water storage}} tank, typically for solar thermal energy. The warmest storage layer is the top storage cylinder and below this there are colder storage layers through natural layering. The water is fed into different storage levels, depending on the available feed temperature and current temperature layering. The feed takes place via a vertical line via valves, in each case the feed water is fed into the storage layer with the corresponding water temperature. This is achieved by means of self-acting valves, feeding the respective temperature or water density into the temperature layer. The advantage {{is that there is}} no mixing of the storage temperature. Swirling of the water is therefore to be avoided as far as possible in <b>stratified</b> <b>storage</b> tanks because this could lead to intermingling of storage layers.

In this study, an air conditioning system with naturally <b>stratified</b> <b>storage</b> tank was designed, constructed and tested. A new type of diffuser was designed and used in this study. Factors that influence the performance of chilled water storage tanks were investigated. The results indicated that <b>stratified</b> <b>storage</b> tank consistently stratified well without any physical barrier. Investigation also showed that storage efficiency decreased with increasing flow rate due to increased mixing of warm and chilled water.

40|$|Many {{hydraulic}} systems implement thermal storages {{to profit from}} the combination of renewable energy and the heating system of a building. They serve as central component of the heating system. To analyze the thermal storage in combination with heating systems for one family houses, a study of the energetic and exergetic behaviour has been made. This PhD study outlines the influence of phase change material (PCM) which is integrated in a thermal storage (buffer storage). Therefore thermal storages are analyzed in dynamic simulations with a one dimensional modelling approach. In the first chapter the basics of thermal storages and the different modelling approaches are described. The models of the thermal storages are developed and validated and measurements of the behaviour of a water- and PCM-storage are made. The existing warm water storage model of the Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate was adapted with the help of parameter identification. For example the value of the number of nodes and the effective heat conduction are investigated. The centerpiece of the PCM-model is the implementation of the heat capacity in dependence on the temperature. More elements are the convection between fluid/PCM and the heat conduction inside of the PCM. The three developed PCM-storage-models [...] a single plate, a stack and a pebble bed [...] are build up with the mentioned elements. The influence on the heat transfer between water/PCM and different discretization numbers are analyzed. The last step is the validation of the PCM-model. In the fifth chapter the different thermal storages (<b>stratified</b> <b>storage,</b> buffer storage and a paraffin and salt hydrate storage) are evaluated in theoretical and dynamical studies. The theoretical potential of the PCM-storage is outlined by energetic and exergetic evaluations. Six hydraulic concepts consisting of boiler/heat pump with radiators or floor heating with/without solar thermal systems and two types of insulation standards from the years 1984 and 2009 are simulated and their energetic and exergetic behaviour is analyzed. The results show that the systems with salt hydrate have the lowest primary energy demand. The integration of a paraffin storage leads to the second lowest demand. The third one is the concept with a <b>stratified</b> <b>storage</b> and the last ones are the concepts with a buffer storage. It is not always possible to distinguish between the systems by their thermal efficiency or exergetic behaviour. Indeed the exergetic behaviour of the systems is sometimes equal. If the boundary is set up directly around the storage, {{it can be seen that}} the exergetic losses of the storage are different for each storage concept...|$|E

40|$|When {{evaluating}} the energy demand of buildings using stratified {{hot water storage}} tanks in an active demand response context, an accurate but low order storage tank model is required. Accurate modelling of buoyancy effects and mixing inside the storage tank as a result of direct inflows is key to obtain valid results. The use of one-dimensional storage tank models is common practice in building simulations, but as buoyancy and mixing are three-dimensional phenomena they cannot be incorporated directly in such a model and special formulations must be used. This paper presents a novel method for incorporating buoyancy and mixing in one-dimensional <b>stratified</b> <b>storage</b> tank models. The model parameters are derived from a series of computational fluid dynamics simulations and correlated with the appropriate non-dimensional parameters. The model is validated against an independent set of charging and discharging experiments. The model is found to represent buoyancy and mixing in the storage tank in a realistic way and to correspond well to experimental results. To allow researchers to assess the uncertainty on performance indicators in building energy simulations, an effective storage capacity ratio is defined and its variation within the model parameter uncertainty range is calculated and compared to other models. The results show a discrepancy between models commonly used in the literature and the presented validated model. When the influence of storage capacity on parameters of interest is known, the effective storage capacity ratio {{can also be used to}} estimate the uncertainty on these parameters caused by the storage tank model. status: publishe...|$|E

A stratified, single-vessel liquid desiccant storage tank {{is an attractive}} option for the seasonal storage of solar energy. Maintaining <b>stratified</b> <b>storage</b> preserves the chemical energy stored in concentrated liquid desiccant solutions. Simulations of desiccant-based storage systems have been limited to modeling well-mixed storage. The subject {{of this paper is}} a density-stratified liquid desiccant storage tank model. The one-dimensional storage is composed of a series of well-mixed segments of a liquid desiccant (CaCl 2 or LiCl) solution in a variable-volume, density-stratified storage tank. The density of each segment depends on both the temperature and the salt concentration of the desiccant solution. The model incorporates mixing due to mass diffusion and buoyancy and accounts for the heat of dilution in the energy balance. Thermal losses to the surroundings are accounted for and auxiliary heat input is permitted. Stored energy is a combination of sensible energy (a function of temperature) and chemical potential energy (a function of salt concentration and temperature). Fluid movement within the tank is simulated with a plug flow approach. Fluid enters the tank through fixed inlets or through an idealized inlet manifold. Fluid exits the tank through fixed outlets. For use with the Transient Systems Simulation (TRNSYS) software, the model is labeled TRNSYS Type 209. The user is able to define the storage characteristics (e. g. capacity, insulation, number and location of inlets and outlets, etc.), the initial conditions, and the boundary conditions of TRNSYS Type 209.

40|$|The Motzfeldt centre {{is one of}} {{four major}} {{alkaline}} centres belonging to the Igaliko complex of South Greenland. The melts parental to the Motzfeldt centre are interpreted from Hf isotopes to be derived form a common mantle source which experienced subsequent isotopic contamination from older crustal components during the interval between segregation and emplacement. Magmatism within the centre commenced with the emplacement of the Motzfeldt Sø Formation at 1273 ± 8 Ma. This unit is unique within the Motzfeldt intrusion as it is characterised by a high degree of textural and mineralogical variability and hosts localised Nb, Ta, U, Th, Zr and REE mineralisation associated with pyrochlore and late-stage REE bearing carbonate phases. Biotite halogen contents show that in addition to enrichment of incompatible elements the MSF and Motzfeldt centre in general is particularly rich in F. The elevated F content is inferred to have extended the crystallisation interval of the melt and facilitated fractionation down to relatively low temperatures. The unusual enrichment of F and incompatible elements in the MSF is suggested to represent the first and most evolved melts extracted from the top of a <b>stratified</b> <b>storage</b> chamber at depth. The MSF is also characterised by pervasive subsolidus alteration, giving the rock and region a striking brick red colour. Pb-Pb pyrochlore studies indicate that alteration in the formation was effectively synchronous (1267 ± 6 Ma), with the magmatic age of emplacement. Fluid inclusion studies suggest that contemporaneous to the exsolution of juvenile, high salinity, F-rich fluids was the wholesale influx of hydrothermally convected low salinity groundwaters through the formation. The presence of pervasive late-stage hematite and calcite throughout the MSF suggests that the oxidation potential of the bulk fluid increased above the hematite-magnetite buffer during the waning stages of the hydrothermal phase. Mineralisation was promoted by this shift in fluid composition, reducing the complexing potential of fluid ligands and facilitating mineralisation within the high-levels units of the intrusion where alteration is most intense. Economic mineralisation associated with the centre is inferred to be largely sourced from the parental melts, however the role the hydrothermal phase played was particularly important in locally mobilising and concentrating incompatible elements within the high-level units of the formation.

The results of the numerical simulation are used to size the SOFC system and storage heat tank to provide energy for a small household using two different fuels. In particular it was shown {{that in the case}} of syngas, due to larger system heat output, a larger tank volume was required in order to accumulate unused heat over the night. The detailed description of the tank model will be useful to energy system modelers when sizing hot water tanks. Problem formulation is reported also using a Matlab script...|$|R
