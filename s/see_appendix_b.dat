The prestige of Sihanouk's name thus helped the Khmer Rouge in their recruitment effort. Rural peasant volunteers believed they were joining a broad-based national resistance movement, headed by the prince, against an ineffectual puppet regime in Phnom Penh. Several groups also rallied to the broad appeal of the GRUNK/FUNK.

Shortly thereafter, the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea (RAK - <b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> <b>B)</b> came into being. The Khmer Rouge dated its own founding from 17 January 1968. RAK leaders, including Pol Pot, who {{had just returned from}} a prolonged visit to China, retreated to the jungle and mountains of Ratanakiri Province (Ratanakiri) in northeastern Cambodia. There they hoped to exploit the disaffection of the Khmer Loeu (<b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> <b>B)</b> over the policies of the Phnom Penh government concerning taxation, corvée labour, and the resettlement of lowland Khmers in the Khmer Loeu areas. For the next two and one-half years, the newly formed RAK remained small (estimates varied from 400 to 2,000 personnel), and poorly equipped with captured weapons. The Khmer Rouge found that, in spite of the Samlot rebellion, discontent against the government in Phnom Penh was then insufficient to attract large numbers of people to the rigors of an armed insurgency. As for external support, there was no move on the part of Hanoi to provide military assistance to the Khmer Rouge because such action would have alienated Sihanouk's government and would have imperiled continued North Vietnamese and Viet Cong access to Cambodian territory as well as their use of the port of Sihanoukville.|$|E

40|$|The {{criterion}} for making good investments is to select projects {{for which the}} net benefits are positive, i. e., incremental benefits exceed incremental costs. The major analytic steps are: define alternatives, evaluate impacts, and select the project with highest net benefits. If pricing is determined independently of marginal cost, however, pricing is exogenous and the investment evaluation is necessarily in a second-best mode. The HERS model incorporates demand elasticity and benefit-cost evaluation principles that are specific to the investment and policy alternatives typically considered at national and local levels. As highway investment concerns shift, the HERS model attempts to adapt by making explicit the variables and relationships that will permit the model to realistically address the new concerns. In doing so, the model becomes more general in its scope and more flexible in its application to questions of interest. For the 1997 Conditions and Performance report to Congress, the HERS model was extended to utilize demand elasticities, such that highway improvements that lowered or raised user costs could lead to changes in travel volumes, and that {{over the long run}} the effects of improvements could be to shift the demand curve from where it might have been placed in initial forecasts (<b>See</b> <b>Appendices</b> <b>B</b> and C). Also, HERS was modified to estimate and take into account emissions of air pollutants, although the feature was not used for the report to Congress. While HERS recognizes a “price ” to the user, it does not incorporate a money price that is separate from user time and operating costs. Fuel taxes and tolls are therefore ignored, both in estimating demand and as potential policy instruments such as for congestion pricing. This appendix presents the principles that apply generally to evaluating highway improvements, under conditions of exogenously-determined arbitrary pricing. The HERS model implements a subset of these principles. The purpose of displaying...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Vietnamese threat, the Cambodian government perceived a menace to internal stability from Son Ngoc Thanh's resurgent antimonarchist Khmer Serei (<b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> <b>B).</b> Although contemporary observers suggested that the Khmer Serei seemed [...] "to {{be more of a}} nuisance... than a genuine threat", the group's insurgent activities and subversive efforts were viewed with increasing alarm by Phnom Penh. In March 1959, for example, the provincial governor of Siem Reap, General Dap Chhuon, a former Khmer Issarak leader who once had fought alongside Sihanouk, was implicated in an attempted Khmer Serei uprising (known at the time as the Bangkok Plot) and was executed. Sihanouk believed the United States had been behind the plot, and his proclivity for assuming complicity between Washington and the Khmer Serei became a particularly significant factor a few years later. In approximately 1965 to 1966, the United States Military Assistance Command—Vietnam (MACV) began recruitment for the Studies and Operations Group and civilian irregular defence groups of Khmer Krom (<b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> <b>B)</b> living in the Mekong Delta, many of whom were Khmer Serei members. In his public pronouncements regarding Khmer Serei activity, Sihanouk charged that the group had originated in South Vietnam and Thailand, and had the backing of both governments. Over the years, there were countless Khmer Serei incidents, followed by amnesties, surrenders, executions, and acrimonious Cambodian charges against South Vietnam, Thailand, and the United States. After Sihanouk was deposed in 1970, the Lon Nol government pardoned some 500 political prisoners, the majority of whom were Khmer Serei. Charges surfaced in 1987 that during his rule Sihanouk had executed as many as 1,000 Khmer Serei suspects.|$|E

The problem addressed in this study was that parents struggle to understand and embrace their significant role in their children 2 ̆ 7 s weight loss process; issues included parent lack of awareness of the epidemic of obesity or the health dangers related to it, challenges in knowing what to do if their child is obese, and a tendency to demonstrate a lack of motivation to change their own behavior. This study used a quantitative correlational design with a pretest/posttest and an intervention that was completed over a 10 - to 16 -week time period from August 20, 2012, to December 8, 2012; recruitment of subjects began in mid-July 2012.
