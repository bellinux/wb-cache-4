5|$|Soon {{after their}} {{delivery}} in 1910, both Minas Geraes and São Paulo were embroiled in the Revolt of the Lash (Revolta da Chibata), {{in which the}} crews of four Brazilian ships demanded the abolition of corporal punishment in the navy. The mutineers surrendered after four days, when a bill was passed granting amnesty to all those involved. In 1922, the two battleships were used to help put down a revolt at Fort Copacabana. Two years later, lieutenants on São Paulo mutinied but found little support from other military units, so they sailed to Montevideo, Uruguay, and obtained asylum. Minas Geraes was modernized in the 1930s, but both battleships were too old to participate actively in the Second World War, and instead were employed as harbor defense ships in Salvador and Recife. São Paulo was sold in 1951 to a British shipbreaker, but was lost in a storm north of the Azores while being towed to its final destination. Minas Geraes was sold to an Italian <b>scrapper</b> in 1953 and towed to Genoa the following year.|$|E

500|$|... "Cross Road Blues" [...] {{reflects}} Johnson's Delta blues {{roots and}} may have been in his repertoire since 1932.

[...] Music historian Edward Komara identifies parts of [...] "Straight Alky Blues" [...] by Leroy Carr and <b>Scrapper</b> Blackwell (1929) along with Roosevelt Sykes' subsequent adaptation as [...] "Black River Blues" [...] (1930) as melodic precedents. [...] However, Johnson infuses their relaxed urban approach with a more forceful rural one. [...] Komara terms Johnson's guitar playing a [...] "blues harp style". [...] It contrasts with Johnson's finger-picking [...] "piano style", which uses a boogie-style accompaniment on the bass strings while playing melody and harmonies on the higher strings. [...] Harp-style playing employs sharp percussive accents on the bass strings (an imitation of the sharp draw used by harmonica players) and allows Johnson to explore different chordings and fills. [...] Johnson uses this technique for [...] "Terraplane Blues", which shares many common elements with [...] "Cross Road Blues".|$|E
