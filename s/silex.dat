25|$|Separation of {{isotopes}} by laser excitation is an Australian {{development that}} also uses UF6. After a protracted development process involving U.S. enrichment company USEC acquiring and then relinquishing commercialization {{rights to the}} technology, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) signed a commercialization agreement with <b>Silex</b> Systems in 2006. GEH has since built a demonstration test loop and announced plans to build an initial commercial facility. Details of the process are classified and restricted by intergovernmental agreements between United States, Australia, and the commercial entities. <b>SILEX</b> has been projected to be {{an order of magnitude}} more efficient than existing production techniques but again, the exact figure is classified. In August, 2011 Global Laser Enrichment, a subsidiary of GEH, applied to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a permit to build a commercial plant. In September 2012, the NRC issued a license for GEH to build and operate a commercial <b>SILEX</b> enrichment plant, although the company had not yet decided whether the project would be profitable enough to begin construction, and despite concerns that the technology could contribute to nuclear proliferation.|$|E
25|$|Vaughan practised medicine, {{perhaps as}} early as the 1640s, and {{attached}} to the second volume of <b>Silex</b> Scintillans (1655) a translation of Henry Nollius's Hermetical Physick. He went on to produce a translation of Nollius's The Chymists Key in 1657.|$|E
25|$|Henry Vaughan (17 April 1621 – 23 April 1695) was a Welsh metaphysical poet, author, {{translator}} and physician, {{who wrote}} in English. He is chiefly known for the religious poetry contained in <b>Silex</b> Scintillans, published in 1650, with a second part published in 1655.|$|E

25|$|The {{action of}} the fetials falls under Jupiter's {{jurisdiction}} as the divine defender of good faith. Several emblems of the fetial office pertain to Jupiter. The <b>silex</b> was the stone used for the fetial sacrifice, housed in the Temple of Iuppiter Feretrius, as was their sceptre. Sacred herbs (sagmina), sometimes identified as vervain, {{had to be taken}} from the nearby citadel (arx) for their ritual use.|$|E
25|$|Above that, {{there were}} the rudens, which were made of ten inches of rammed concrete. The next layer, the nucleus, was made of twelve to {{eighteen}} inches of successively laid and rolled layers of concrete. Summa crusta of <b>silex</b> or lava polygonal slabs, one to three feet in diameter and eight to twelve inches thick, were laid {{on top of the}} rudens. The final upper surface was made of concrete or well smoothed and fitted flint.|$|E
25|$|Del Toro {{wanted to}} include a fairy tale about a dragon for Ofelia to narrate to her unborn brother. The tale {{involved}} the dragon, named Varanium <b>Silex,</b> who guarded a mountain surrounded by thorns, but at its peak is a blue rose that can grant immortality. The dragon and the thorns ward off many men though, who decide {{it is better to}} avoid pain than to be given immortality. Although the scene was thematically important, it was cut short for budget reasons.|$|E
25|$|Silicon dioxide, {{also known}} as silica (from the Latin <b>silex),</b> is an oxide of silicon with the {{chemical}} formula , most commonly found in nature as quartz and in various living organisms. In {{many parts of the}} world, silica is the major constituent of sand. Silica {{is one of the most}} complex and most abundant families of materials, existing as a compound of several minerals and as synthetic product. Notable examples include fused quartz, fumed silica, silica gel, and aerogels. It is used in structural materials, microelectronics, and as components in the food and pharmaceutical industries.|$|E
25|$|The name {{silicosis}} (from the Latin <b>silex,</b> or flint) {{was originally}} used in 1870 by Achille Visconti (1836–1911), prosector in the Ospedale Maggiore of Milan. The recognition of respiratory problems from breathing in dust dates to ancient Greeks and Romans. Agricola, in the mid-16th century, wrote about lung problems from dust inhalation in miners. In 1713, Bernardino Ramazzini noted asthmatic symptoms and sand-like substances {{in the lungs}} of stone cutters. With industrialization, as opposed to hand tools, came increased production of dust. The pneumatic hammer drill was introduced in 1897 and sandblasting was introduced in about 1904, both significantly contributing to the increased prevalence of silicosis.|$|E
25|$|In 1868 Cox and Bloomfield applied {{under the}} {{conditions}} of the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1868 for their runs Woodlands, Miriam Vale and Polmaily to be consolidated as the Miriam Vale run and <b>Silex,</b> Ilex and Gochen to be consolidated as Bulburan. Miriam Vale was divided into resumed and leasehold sections in 1869/70, but there was little demand to open this land for selection. Some Miriam Vale land had been taken up as freehold by 1884. In January 1875 a telegraph office was opened at Miriam Vale, and a post office was established there in April 1877, reflecting a population increase in the district.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} a wine region will largely dictate whether Chenin blanc is {{produced}} in a predominately sweet or dry manner, while the vineyard soil type will generally influence the overall style of the wine. Heavy clay based soils, paired with the right climate, is favorable {{to the development of}} weighty, botrytized dessert wines that need time to age and mature. Well-drained and less organic, predominately sandy soils tend to produce lighter styles of wine that mature more quickly. Chenin blanc planted in soils with a high <b>silex</b> content will produce wines with distinctive minerally notes, while limestone based soils will encourage wines with sharp acidity. In Vouvray the soil is predominately argilo-calcaire or calcareous clay, which produces rounded wines with both acidity and weight. In areas where schist is plentiful in the soil, Chenin blanc grapes will generally ripen earlier than in vineyards with predominately clay based soils.|$|E
25|$|The wide {{valley of}} the Loire {{is made up of}} a mixture of sand and silt that is carried along by the river. The slopes on either side are made up of a mixture of clays and other {{elements}} that have come down from the plateau areas. The wine-growing area is mainly located on the two halves of the plateau and, occasionally, on the upper slopes to either side of the valley. The plateau areas are covered in a thin layer of clay-sand silt that has been deposited there by the wind. Beneath this silt lies a polygenetic puddingstone dating from the Upper Eocene Age, mixed with varicoloured clays and small pebbles of rolled <b>silex,</b> Jurassic cherts and quartz grains. The soils of this wine-growing terroir can be carbonate, overlying tuffeau stone on the higher slopes, or, more frequently, silicate and fairly heavy, overlying sands and clay gravels.|$|E
25|$|In the Neolithic period (see Neolithic Europe), megalithic (large stone) monuments, {{such as the}} dolmens and menhirs at Carnac, Saint-Sulpice-de-Faleyrens and {{elsewhere}} in France begin to appear; this appearance is thought to start in the fifth millennium BC, although some authors speculate about Mesolithic roots. In France there are some 5,000 megalithics monuments, mainly in Brittany, where there is the largest concentration of these monuments. In this area there is wide variety of these monuments that have been well preserved, like menhirs, dolmen, cromlechs and cairns. The Cairn of Gavrinis in southern Brittany is an outstanding example of megalithic art : its 14 meters inner corridor is nearly completely adorned with ornamental carvings. The great broken menhir of Er-Grah, now in four pieces was more than 20 meters high originally, making it the largest menhir ever erected. France has also numerous painted stones, polished stone axes, and inscribed menhirs from this period. The Grand-Pressigny area was known for its precious <b>silex</b> blades and they were extensively exported during the Neolithic.|$|E
500|$|The first hull {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Baltiysky Zavod in Leningrad in March 1974 under the name Kirov. By the time the ship was {{launched}} in December 1977, she had been reclassified as a [...] "heavy nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser" [...] (тяжёлый атомный ракетный крейсер; tyazholyy atomnyy raketnyy kreyser), with its primary armament being 20 SS-N-19 Shipwreck (P-700 Granit) anti-ship missiles. Commissioned into the Northern Fleet, [...] was the largest surface warship, excluding aircraft carriers and amphibious assault vessels, built {{since the end of}} the Second World War. Equipped with both anti-ship and anti-submarine missiles, as well as area defence and point defence surface to air missiles, torpedoes and a pair of 100 mm guns, the ship gave the Soviet Union a visible platform for power projection in the immediate absence of large aircraft carriers. Following the appearance of Kirov, two more units, [...] and , were commissioned at four-year intervals. When Frunze was commissioned in 1984, it was seen to have a different weapons fit to Kirov, with the pair of single 100mm guns swapped for a twin 130mm turret, and the SS-N-14 <b>Silex</b> ASW missile system deleted in favour of adding eight SA-N-9 Gauntlet SAM launchers. In the event, none of the four ships of the class received a completely identical armament fit.|$|E
2500|$|Certainly Vaughan {{would have}} never written {{the way he did}} without Herbert's direction. The {{explicit}} spiritual influence here is undeniable, and is all but proclaimed in the preface to <b>Silex</b> Scintillans. The prose of Vaughan exemplifies this as well. For instance, The Temple, by Herbert, is often seen as the inspiration and model on which Vaughan created his work. <b>Silex</b> Scintillans is most often classed with this collection of Herbert's. <b>Silex</b> Scintillans borrows the same themes, experience, and beliefs as The Temple.

2500|$|Given {{the large}} amount of {{sunlight}} Mildura receives, it has been proposed as the site for several proposals for large scale solar power in Australia including a massive solar updraft tower proposal in 2004 and 2010. [...] In 2013, Mildura Solar Concentrator Power Station, a 1.5MW demonstration plant, was commissioned by <b>Silex</b> Systems and it was expected to be expanded to 100MW by 2017. However, in August 2014, the project was abandoned by <b>Silex,</b> due to lack of commitment to renewable energy by the Abbott government, with plans to scrap the praised Renewable Energy Target (RET) in Australia cited as {{one of the main reasons}} for the abandonment of the project. This decision has been extensively criticised by international scientists, who claim Australia risks being [...] "left behind the rest of the world" [...] if it cuts its plans for renewable energy. The decision to not build the plant may also cause electricity prices to rise significantly in the country.|$|E
2500|$|Sauvignon blanc and Pinot noir are the {{principal}} grapes of this region that is centered around the appellation of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé. The two towns of Sancerre and Pouilly-sur-Loire (where Pouilly-Fumé is made) sit {{on opposite sides of}} the Loire river with Sancerre being about [...] to the northwest of Pouilly. The Fumé is said to come from the <b>silex</b> flint interspersed with the limestone in the area that can give a smoky gunflint note to the wine. Another possibility for the name is the early morning fog created by the Loire river that can blanket the vineyards. Wines labeled with just Pouilly or Pouilly-sur-Loire are often made from the Chasselas grape.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first volume}} of <b>Silex</b> Scintillans was {{followed}} by The Mount of Olives, or Solitary Devotions (1652), a prose book of devotions. It provides prayers for different stages of the day, for prayer in church, and for other purposes. It is written as a [...] "companion volume" [...] to the Book of Common Prayer, to which it alludes frequently, {{though it had been}} outlawed under the Commonwealth. The work was also influenced by Lancelot Andrewes's Preces Privatae (1615) and John Cosin's Collection of Private Devotions (1627). Flores Solitudinis (1654) contains translations from the Latin of two works by the Spanish Jesuit Juan Eusebio Nieremberg, one by a 5th-century Bishop of Lyon, Eucherius, and by Paulinus of Nola, of whom Vaughan wrote a prose life.|$|E

Countries that had enrichment programs in the past include Libya and South Africa, although Libya's facility was never operational. Australia has developed a laser enrichment process known as <b>SILEX,</b> which it intends to pursue through financial investment in a U.S. commercial venture by General Electric. [...] It has also been claimed that Israel has a uranium enrichment program housed at the Negev Nuclear Research Center site near Dimona.|$|E
2500|$|In 1787 Antoine Lavoisier {{suspected}} that silica {{might be an}} oxide of a fundamental chemical element, but the chemical affinity of silicon for oxygen is high enough {{that he had no}} means to reduce the oxide and isolate the element. After an attempt to isolate silicon in 1808, Sir Humphry Davy proposed the name [...] "silicium" [...] for silicon, from the Latin <b>silex,</b> silicis for flint, and adding the [...] "-ium" [...] ending because he believed it to be a metal. Most other languages use transliterated forms of Davy's name, sometimes adapted to local phonology (e.g. German Silizium, French silicium). A few others use instead a calque of the Latin root (e.g. Russian кремний, from кремень [...] "flint"; Greek πυριτιο from πυρ [...] "fire"; Finnish pii from piikivi [...] "flint").|$|E
2500|$|Most {{vineyards}} {{planted on}} the hills around Sancerre are on south facing slopes at altitudes between 655-1,310 feet (200–400 meters). The soils around the area can be roughly classified into three categories. The far western reaches heading towards Menetou-Salon have [...] "white" [...] soils with clay and limestone. Around the village of Chavignol (considered a cru of Sancerre), the soil also includes some Kimmeridgian marl. Wines from these western reaches {{tend to have more}} body and power in their flavour profile. Heading closer to the city of Sancerre the soil picks up more gravel mixed with the limestone and tends to produce more light bodied wines with delicate perfumes. The third classification of soil is found around the city of Sancerre itself which includes many deposits of flint (also known as <b>silex)</b> that add distinctive mineral components. These wines tend to be heavily perfumed with the longest aging potential of Sancerres.|$|E
2500|$|Jupiter Feretrius, {{who carries}} away {{the spoils of}} war". Feretrius was called upon to witness solemn oaths.

Iuppiter Feretrius was therefore equivalent to Iuppiter Lapis, the latter used for a specially solemn oath.

2500|$|It was {{not until}} the writing of <b>Silex</b> Scintillans that Vaughan {{received}} significant acclaim. The period shortly preceding the publication of the first volume of this work (1650) marked an important period of his life. Certain indications in the first volume and explicit statements in the preface to the second volume (1655) suggest that Vaughan suffered a prolonged sickness that inflicted much pain. Vaughan interprets this experience to be an encounter with death that alerted him to a [...] "misspent youth". Vaughan believed he had been spared to make amends and start a new course not only in his life but in the literature he would produce. He described his previous work as foul and a contribution to [...] "corrupt literature". Perhaps the most notable mark of Vaughan's conversion is how much it is credited to George Herbert. Vaughan claims he is the least of Herbert's many [...] "pious converts". It was during this period of Vaughan's life, around 1650, that he adopted the saying [...] "moriendo, revixi" [...] – [...] "by dying, I gain new life".|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{distinct}} difference between the atmosphere Vaughan attempts to convey in this work and in his most famous work, <b>Silex</b> Scintillans. Olor Iscanus is a direct representation of a specific period in Vaughan's life, which emphasises other secular writers and provides allusions to debt and happy living. A fervent topic of Vaughan throughout these poems is the Civil War and reveals Vaughan's somewhat paradoxical thinking {{that in the end}} does not indicate whether he participated or not. Vaughan states his complete satisfaction at being clean of [...] "innocent blood", but also provides what seem to be eyewitness accounts of battles and his own [...] "soldiery". Although Vaughan is thought to have been a royalist, these poems express contempt for all current authority and a lack of zeal for the royalist cause. His poems generally reflect a sense of severe decline, which may mean that Vaughan lamented the effects of the war on the monarchy and society. His short poem [...] "The Timber", ostensibly about a dead tree, concludes ...|$|E
2500|$|Jupiter's {{most ancient}} attested forms of cult {{belong to the}} State cult: these include the mount cult (see section above note n. 22). [...] In Rome this cult entailed the {{existence}} of particular sanctuaries {{the most important of}} which were located on Mons Capitolinus (earlier Tarpeius). The mount had two tops that were both destined to the discharge of acts of cult related to Jupiter. The northern and higher top was the arx and on it was located the observation place of the augurs (auguraculum) and to it headed the monthly procession of the sacra Idulia. On the southern top was to be found the most ancient sanctuary of the god: the shrine of [...] Iuppiter Feretrius allegedly built by Romulus, restored by Augustus. The god here had no image and was represented by the sacred flintstone (<b>silex).</b> The most ancient known rites, those of the spolia opima and of the fetials which connect Jupiter with Mars and Quirinus are dedicated to Iuppiter Feretrius or Iuppiter Lapis. The concept of the sky god was already overlapped with the ethical and political domain since this early time. According to Wissowa and Dumézil Iuppiter Lapis seems to be inseparable from Iuppiter Feretrius in whose tiny templet on the Capitol the stone was lodged.|$|E
