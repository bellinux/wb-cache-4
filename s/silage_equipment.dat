After having been in storage 2 months, a part of the alfalfa hay was removed from the barn, coarsely ground through a 1 / 4 -inch screen, made into 3 / 8 -inch pellets by a local feed processor, and stored for later feeding. The forage-type sorghum was field harvested in mid-October with the usual <b>silage</b> <b>equipment.</b> The loads were alternately ensiled in upright silos or dehydrated, finely ground, and pelleted into 3 / 8 -inch pellets. These pellets were then stored ill bulk for later feeding. The prairie hay used was of good quality. It was grow a local farm meadow. Fifty head of choice-quality heifer calves from the Jeff Ranch, Fort Davis, Texas, were {{used in this}} experiment. They were allotted into five lots, 10 head per lot, on the basis of live weight. They were fed a winter ration consisting entirely of alfalfa hay or pellets and either sorghum silage or dehydrated pelleted sorghum for 126 days...|$|E
