40|$|The biosynthetic {{gene cluster}} for the {{aromatic}} polyketide <b>steffimycin</b> of the anthracycline {{family has been}} cloned and characterized from “Streptomyces steffisburgensis” NRRL 3193. Sequence analysis of a 42. 8 -kbp DNA region revealed the presence of 36 open reading frames (ORFs) (one of them incomplete), 24 of which, spanning 26. 5 kb, are probably involved in <b>steffimycin</b> biosynthesis. They code for all the activities required for polyketide biosynthesis, tailoring, regulation, and resistance but show no evidence of genes involved in l-rhamnose biosynthesis. The involvement of the cluster in <b>steffimycin</b> biosynthesis was confirmed by expression of a region of about 15 kb containing 15 ORFS, 11 of them forming part of the cluster, in the heterologous host Streptomyces albus, allowing the isolation of a biosynthetic intermediate. In addition, the expression in S. albus of the entire cluster, contained in a region of 34. 8 kb, combined with the expression of plasmid pRHAM, directing the biosynthesis of l-rhamnose, led {{to the production of}} <b>steffimycin.</b> Inactivation of the stfX gene, coding for a putative cyclase, revealed that this enzymatic activity participates in the cyclization of the fourth ring, making the final steps in the biosynthesis of the <b>steffimycin</b> aglycon similar to those in the biosynthesis of jadomycin or rabelomycin. Inactivation of the stfG gene, coding for a putative glycosyltransferase involved in the attachment of l-rhamnose, allowed the production of a new compound corresponding to the <b>steffimycin</b> aglycon compound also observed in S. albus upon expression of the entire cluster...|$|E
