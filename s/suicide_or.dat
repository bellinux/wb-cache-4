5|$|Bond {{chooses not}} to take Smythe into custody immediately, but leaves him to {{contemplate}} his options – <b>suicide</b> <b>or</b> a court martial. As Smythe hunts for scorpion fish to feed Octopussy, he suffers a sting which triggers a fatal heart attack, during which Octopussy pulls him under. Deciding to spare Smythe's reputation, Bond classifies the death as an accidental drowning.|$|E

5|$|Davison was {{a staunch}} feminist and passionate Christian, and {{considered}} that socialism was {{a moral and}} political force for good. Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what she planned {{to do at the}} Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, <b>suicide,</b> <b>or</b> an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse; none has ever been proven.|$|E
5|$|Enraged upon {{learning}} the truth, Tiberius soon ordered more killings. Livilla committed <b>suicide</b> <b>or</b> was {{starved to death}} by her mother Antonia Minor. The remaining children of Sejanus, Capito Aelianus and Junilla, were executed in December of that year. According to ancient historians, {{because there was no}} precedent for the capital punishment of a virgin, Junilla was raped first, with the rope around her neck. Their bodies were thrown down the Gemonian stairs. At the beginning of the following year, damnatio memoriae was also passed on Livilla.|$|E
5|$|In September 1928 Britten went as a boarder to Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk. At {{the time}} he felt unhappy there, even writing in his diary of contemplating <b>suicide</b> <b>or</b> running away: he hated being {{separated}} from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though {{he was not the}} target of it. He remained there for two years and in 1930, he won a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London; his examiners were the composers John Ireland and Ralph Vaughan Williams and the college's harmony and counterpoint teacher, S P Waddington.|$|E

5|$|Shen Kuo's Dream Pool Essays {{argued against}} {{traditional}} Chinese beliefs in anatomy (such as his argument for two throat valves instead of three); this perhaps spurred {{the interest in}} the performance of post-mortem autopsies in China during the 12th century. The physician and judge known as Song Ci (1186–1249) wrote a pioneering work of forensic science on the examination of corpses in order to determine cause of death (strangulation, poisoning, drowning, blows, etc.) and to prove whether death resulted from murder, <b>suicide,</b> <b>or</b> accidental death. Song Ci stressed the importance of proper coroner's conduct during autopsies and the accurate recording of the inquest of each autopsy by official clerks.|$|E

5|$|At 01:00 the Soviet forces {{picked up}} a radio message from the LVI Panzer Corps {{requesting}} a cease-fire. Down in the Führerbunker, General Krebs and General Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head. The last defenders {{in the area of}} the bunker complex, French SS volunteers of the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French) remained until the early morning. The Soviet forces then captured the Reich Chancellery. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 6:00 and his meeting with Chuikov ended at 8:23. Johannes Hentschel, the master electro-mechanic for the bunker complex, stayed after everyone else had either committed <b>suicide</b> <b>or</b> left, as the field hospital in the Reich Chancellery above needed power and water. He surrendered to the Red Army as they entered the bunker complex at 09:00 on 2 May. The bodies of Goebbels' six children were discovered on 3 May. They were found in their beds in the Vorbunker, with the clear mark of cyanide shown on their faces.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{decided on}} 21 June that Röhm and the SA {{leadership}} {{had to be}} eliminated. He sent Göring to Berlin on 29 June, to meet with Himmler and Heydrich to plan the action. Hitler took charge in Munich, where Röhm was arrested; he gave Röhm the choice to commit <b>suicide</b> <b>or</b> be shot. When Röhm refused to kill himself, he was shot dead by two SS officers. Between 85 and 200 members of the SA leadership and other political adversaries, including Gregor Strasser, were killed between 30 June and 2 July 1934 in these actions, known as the Night of the Long Knives. With the SA thus neutralised, the SS became an independent organisation answerable only to Hitler on 20 July 1934. Himmler's title of Reichsführer-SS became the highest formal SS rank, equivalent to a field marshal in the army. The SA was converted into a sports and training organisation.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Parsons {{separated}} from Helen after {{having an affair}} with her sister Sara; when Sara left him for L. Ron Hubbard, he conducted the Babalon Working, a series of rituals designed to invoke the Thelemic goddess Babalon to Earth. He and Hubbard continued the procedure with Marjorie Cameron, whom Parsons married in 1946. After Hubbard and Sara defrauded him of his life savings, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. and went through various jobs while acting as a consultant for the Israeli rocket program. Amid the climate of McCarthyism, he was accused of espionage and left unable to work in rocketry. In 1952, Parsons {{died at the age of}} 37 in a home laboratory explosion that attracted national media attention; the police ruled it an accident, but many associates suspected <b>suicide</b> <b>or</b> assassination.|$|E
40|$|Background: Most {{evidence}} behind {{interventions for}} depression is, in essence, {{based on the}} total score of the 17 -item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). We identified no systematic review or meta-analysis examining if a total 17 -item HDRS score is associated with <b>suicide</b> attempts <b>or</b> <b>suicides</b> in depressive patients. Methodology: Based on a systematic literature search CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and Science Citation Index Expanded, we systematically reviewed and meta-analysed observational studies examining if the total 17 -item HDRS score is associated with <b>suicide</b> attempts <b>or</b> <b>suicides.</b> Results: We identified and included ten cohort studies - seven retrospective and three prospective. All the studies were assessed as high risk of bias. Meta-analysis on the HDRS scores from three retrospective studies showed that depressive patients with a suicide attempt during the on-going depressive episode had a significantly higher score on the HDRS compared to non-suicidal patients (mean difference 6. 31 HDRS; 95 % confidence interval 4. 72 to 7. 91; P< 0. 00001, I 2 = 0). However, meta-analyses of the HDRS scores from three prospective studies and four studies reporting retrospectively lifetime suicide attempts showed {{no significant differences between}} patients with <b>or</b> without a <b>suicide</b> attempt <b>or</b> <b>suicide.</b> Conclusion: A total score on the HDRS {{does not seem to be}} associated with past <b>or</b> future <b>suicide</b> attempts <b>or</b> <b>suicides.</b> There seems to be a need for other assessment tools to predict and explain risks of suicidality...|$|R

5|$|On 11 September the frigate HMS Africaine {{arrived from}} Rodriguez, {{commanded}} by Captain Robert Corbet {{who had served}} in the raid on Saint Paul in 1809. Corbet was a deeply unpopular commander and when his frigate was attacked and captured by Bouvet's frigates at the Action of 13 September 1810, rumours spread that his death was the result or <b>suicide</b> <b>or</b> even murder, rather than from the battle. Rowley was able to recapture Africaine the following day, but the danger that Hamelin's ships posed to British frigates sailing independently was further emphasised at the Action of 18 September 1810, when HMS Ceylon was captured by Hamelin's flagship Vénus. Again, Rowley was able to recapture the British frigate and on this occasion the damage done to Vénus was so severe that she was unable to outrun Boadicea and she too was captured, with Hamelin on board.|$|E
5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either <b>suicide</b> <b>or</b> murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the floor with a pistol a few inches from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, {{it would not have been}} easy for him to shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E

It is not revealed whether she commits <b>suicide</b> <b>or</b> not. In a confession to Father Ralph, Father John expresses guilt he did not absolve Linda before her confession abruptly ended. Father Ralph says that even if Linda is dead, her soul is immortal, and that Father John's penance is to absolve her now. Father John does so. The film ends with a childhood memory of young Linda at church, where a group of boys laugh at her old torn clothes until she is defended by a young John Buerlein, whose act seems to make a strong positive impact upon her.|$|E
