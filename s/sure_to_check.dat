25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} best practices in design for mobile web browsing user experiences, analyzing the newest strategies for optimizing efficient and pleasurable interfaces in a mobile device context. This involved understanding the history of mobile device communications, basic web design principles, and modeling how businesses project their mobile web experiences to end users. The research includes current design trends, thought processes to consider, and expert advice from industry professionals. In addition, user experience survey’s supplement the analysis, scoring industry leaders on how they present their mobile web experiences (viewed from iPad 2 2 ̆ 6 iPhone 4). The test results and advice pooled from this study can be used to better strategize, prepare, and execute rewarding user experiences and interaction designs for a mobile device context. In its simplest form, the process of delivering rewarding mobile web experiences means focusing on speed, mobile constraints, and understanding behaviors of the user. Making <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> continually <b>check</b> back into these three categories as a mobile strategy evolves from prototype to product is fundamental to ensuring all aspects of a mobile web user are addressed. The best way to validate the planning of this interaction is to incorporate multiple different angles and backgrounds of thought from a business, not just that of the designers. Sure designers are responsible for understanding color theory fundamentals, typography implementation, and spatial layouts, but this shouldn’t qualify them in holding the sole decision process for what capabilities to provide or prevent users. Counter to traditional thought, the best way of transmitting a satisfactory and unique mobile web user experience is to expand the original brainstorming of mobile strategies to a wider sum of individuals, incorporating people who understand the company and business from a different perspective than that of the designers. This report digs into unraveling the big picture of mobile web user experiences and leads into deciphering which pieces of the interaction are most vital to ensuring pleasurable usability and encounters between all parties involved...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} generation of discrete planes using generalized substitutions. We give sufficient conditions <b>to</b> be <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> generate all of a discrete plane by a sequence of substitutions; these conditions, however, are not easy <b>to</b> <b>check,</b> even on simple examples. One can build approximations of discrete planes in several ways, namely as stepped surfaces (unions of faces), as sets of vertices, or as two-dimensional sequences on a three-letter alphabet; these codings are equivalent in some cases, as we recall below. Recent progresses have given a way to act on these approximations by generalized substitutions; but an open question is to know whether we can, in this way, generate all (or an arbitrarily large neighborhood of the origin) of the discrete plane. In this short communication, we give a sufficient condition to generate an arbitrarily large neighborhood of the origin; unfortunately, this condition seems, at the moment, to be difficult <b>to</b> <b>check</b> on explicit examples, even in simple cases. 1 Generation of discrete planes: definitions and known results 1. 1 Discrete plane...|$|R
5000|$|Actress Pat Carroll and the Ursula animators pump {{astonishing}} gobs of rotten-flirty menace and perversity into Witch Ursula, {{who looks}} {{a bit like the}} late actor Divine pasted over with an evil Jack Nicholson leer and squeezed into a cleavage-popping black evening gown, tailing off startlingly into eight squiggling black octopus tentacles. With her pet moray eels, she is a genuine nightmare, an obese lavender voluptuary peeling off lines like [...] "Lifes full of hard choices [...] [...] [...] Int it?" [...] with blowzy relish or erupting from the ocean like Moby Dick on bonbons. The Los Angeles Times Michael Wilmington William Thomas of Empire described Ursula as [...] "truly quake-inducing", while Times Eliana Dockterman enjoyed the fact that, unlike previous Disney villains, [...] "Ursula doesn’t even pretend to be good ... Right off the bat, she owns her evil witchiness". Kilmeny Fane-Saunders, writing for Radio Times, warned parents that Ursula could possibly frighten young children. However, The Huffington Posts Hilary Sheinbau believes that [...] "there are many of these people who walk ... talk and strive among us", concluding, [...] "it’s important for kids to know that not everyone is going to look out for their best interests, however tempting some offers may be." [...] Metros Duncan Lindsay agreed that Ursula teaches children [...] "that binding contracts are a necessary part of every deal. We can thank her for all of our business sense as we are always <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> triple <b>check</b> that paperwork when ... securing deals." [...] Dave Smith of the Disney Archives wrote, [...] "When anger does bring out her true emotion, the effects are staggering. Her look of stark hatred, even while her face is still human, must certainly have brought nightmares to young children. And when she finally changes into a giant, towering up through the waves and over puny mortals, the embodiment of fury is quite breathtaking." [...] Smith concluded, [...] "Earlier we may have chuckled at her villainy; at this moment, there is no laughter ... only genuine fear." [...] Meanwhile, SMOSHs Francesco Marciuliano praised the character as [...] "one of the most gleefully evil characters Disney has ever created." ...|$|R
