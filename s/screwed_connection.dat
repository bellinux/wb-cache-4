40|$|Aim The aim of {{this study}} is to evaluate, both in vitro and in vivo, two {{different}} types of implant-abutment connections: <b>screwed</b> <b>connection</b> and cemented connection, analyzing the permeability of the IAI to bacterial colonization and the stability to chewing forces. Materials and Methods In this study were compared two different types of implant-abutment connections: internal hexagon <b>screwed</b> <b>connection</b> (Winsix®, BioSAF IN, Ancona, Italy) Group 1; and internal hexagon cemented-conical connection (Bone System®, Milano, Italy) Group 2. Group 1 and Group 2 were compared on three levels: impermeability to bacterial penetration an in vitro study, resistance to loading for 5 years a simulated computer model, type of peri-implant bacterial colonization and health of peri-implant soft tissues around the implant for 2 year in an in vivo study. Results The results had showed the lower stability to the screwed implant-abutment connection than the cemented implant-abutment connection both for the permeability to the bacterial colonization than for the stability to the chewing forces. Conclusion Also if the implants long-term failures are consequences of multi-factorial elements the choice of an adequate implant system is fundamental for the long-term success. Also the choice of connection system is very important and would be preferable to choose implants with cemented connection instead of implants with <b>screwed</b> <b>connection...</b>|$|E

40|$|Several {{applications}} {{involving the}} use of Fibre Reinforced Polymers (FRP) glued on the tension side of timber beams are available in literature. However, some drawbacks (durability, product cost and health and safety restrictions, difficulties in removal) have limited an intensive use of organic adhesives (i. e. epoxy resins, etc).

This paper describes an experimental investigation on the mechanical behaviour of externally bonded FRP composites using steel screws. Two different composite materials have been considered: Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) and Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) and three different metal screw types have been used. FRP strengthening was then applied to timber blocks and shear tested conducted to study the performance of the <b>screwed</b> <b>connection.</b> The response of the <b>screwed</b> <b>connection</b> was recorded: catastrophic collapse did not occur, as the connection failed gradually for slippage phenomena produced by screw yielding and wood displacement.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} in vivo {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} {{two different types of}} implant-abutment connections: <b>screwed</b> <b>connection</b> and cemented connection, analyzing peri-implant bacteria microflora as well as other clinical parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty implants were selected, inserted in 20 patients, 10 with a screwed implant-abutment connection (Group 1) and 10 with a cemented implant-abutment connection (Group 2). The peri-implant microflora was collected, after at least 360 days from the prosthetic rehabilitation, using paper points inserted in peri-implant sulcus for 30 s. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Real-time analyzed the presence of 9 bacteria periodontal-pathogens and Candida albicans. RESULTS: Our findings showed that bacteria colonized all Groups analyzed, the average bacterial count was 3. 7 E + 08 (± 1. 19) in Group 1, compared to 2. 1 E + 08 (± 0. 16) in Group 2; no statistically significant differences were observed (p> 0. 0. 5). In Group 1, however, bacterial colonization of peri-implant sulci was over the pathogenic threshold for 5 bacteria, indicating a high-risk of peri-implantitis. Also in Group 2, results showed a microflora composed by all bacteria analyzed but, in this case, bacterial colonization of peri-implant sulci was over the pathogenic threshold for only 1 bacterium, indicating a lower risk of peri-implantitis. Moreover, clinical parameters (PPD > 3 mm and m SBI > 0) confirmed a greater risk of peri-implantitis in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Load-bearing cold-formed steel (CFS) walls {{sheathed}} {{with double}} layers of gypsum plasterboard {{on both sides}} have demonstrated good fire resistance and attracted increasing interest for use in mid-rise CFS structures. As the main <b>connection</b> method, <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> between CFS and gypsum sheathing {{play an important role}} in both the structural design and fire resistance of this wall system. However, studies on the mechanical behavior of <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> with double-layer gypsum sheathing are still limited. In this study, 200 monotonic tests of <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> with single- or double-layer gypsum sheathing at both ambient and elevated temperatures were conducted. The failure of <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> with double-layer gypsum sheathing in shear was different from that of single-layer gypsum sheathing connections at ambient temperature, and it could be described as the breaking of the loaded sheathing edge combined with significant screw tilting and the loaded sheathing edge flexing fracture.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of single}} shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures {{has been investigated}} in this study. The current design rules on bolted and <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels for cold-formed steel structures are applicable for ambient temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperature conditions. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for bolted and <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of cold-formed steel structures at elevated temperatures. A total of 30 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of the thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures, and also to determine the critical temperatures for connection tests. A total of 510 tests on single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures was performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the predicted values calculated from the North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for coldformed steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties of the thin sheet steels were used due to the deterioration of material at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. Finite element models for single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> were developed and verified against the experimental results.

Extensive parametric studies that included 490 finite element specimens were carried out using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as design equations for tilting and bearing strengths of <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> were proposed based on both the experimental and the numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C.

The aim of this in vitro study is to evaluate two different types of implant-abutment connections: the <b>screwed</b> <b>connection</b> (Group 1) and the cemented connection (Group 2), analyzing the permeability of the IAI to bacterial colonization, using human saliva as culture medium. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of twelve implants were tested, six in each experimental group. Five healthy patients were enrolled in this study. Two milliliters of non-stimulated saliva were collected from each subject and mixed in a test tube. After 14 days of incubation of the bacteria sample in the implant fixtures, a PCR-Real Time analysis was performed. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the proportions of implant-abutment assembled structures detected with bacterial leakage. Differences in the bacterial counts of the two groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. A p value < 0. 05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The results showed a decreased stability with the screwed implant-abutment connections compared to the cemented implant-abutment connections.

Such load-bearing walls, consisting of a cold-formed steel frame with structural sheeting screwed onto it, act as primary lateral load resisting component that has to maintain the stability and integrity of the structure. Although these panels have some unique advantageous properties, they are characterised by small openings due to closely spaced studs (i. e. the vertical frame members). To increase the building’s transparency, the load-bearing capacities of glass can be utilised by bracing the frames with glass panes instead of traditional sheeting. For this purpose, the traditional <b>screwed</b> <b>connection</b> {{is transformed into a}} circumferentially linear adhesive connection between frame and glazing. This modification results in an altered behaviour of the newly developed hybrid cold-formed steel-glass panel compared to a traditional panel.
