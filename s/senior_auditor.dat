25|$|He was a licentiate when {{he arrived}} in the Philippines on 29 March 1661 to serve as oidor (auditor) in the Real Audiencia. On 22 June 1662, Coloma married María de Cuellar y Cisneros in the Philippines. During the administrations of Governor-General Diego de Salcedo to Manuel de León, Coloma held the {{position}} of <b>senior</b> <b>auditor.</b> As <b>senior</b> <b>auditor,</b> Coloma was in charge of military affairs. This position was challenged by Francisco Sotomayor y Mansilla, who was also part of the Real Audiencia, arguing that {{he was supposed to be}} the <b>senior</b> <b>auditor.</b> However, in fear of Salcedo, Sotomayor gave in to Coloma and assumed the second highest position.|$|E
25|$|Coloma {{was with}} Governor de León when the latter {{went to the}} convent of Tondo, Manila with full {{military}} display. This was done to influence {{the election of the}} provincial superior in the area, of which the leading candidate (Francisco de Medina Basco) was not in good terms with de León. While still in the Philippines, his wife died. The governor, then suffering from excessive corpulency, visited the funeral of Coloma's wife. However, the smell of buried corpses made de León's condition worse. Soon enough, his wounds reopened and he died of hemorrhage on 11 April 1677. On the same day, Coloma, then presiding over the Real Audiencia of Manila as <b>senior</b> <b>auditor,</b> succeeded as governor-general. One of the first acts of the Coloma administration was the disposition of de León's estate, which amounted to 250,000 pesos. All of the former governor's fortune was allotted to charity, including 50,000 pesos for the Misericordia, 33,000 pesos for the founding of chaplaincies, 12,000 pesos for the rebuilding of San Lazaro Hospital in Santa Cruz, Manila, and another 12,000 pesos for rebuilding the seminary in Santa Potenciana. In 1668, eight thousand pesos were brought to New Spain but it was from the vandala of the rice production of Pampanga. The Kapampangan people appealed to Coloma for help, and in a landmark decision, the entire eight thousand pesos were returned to the people.|$|E

25|$|When a coup {{replaced}} Salcedo with Juan Manuel de la Peña Bonifaz on 28 September 1668, the {{new administration}} had Sotomayor {{and the rest of}} the members of the Real Audiencia locked up outside Manila. The new governor and his associates seized Salcedo's fortune of 14,000 pesos and the situado brought by the Manila galleon amounting to 400,000 pesos for themselves. To circumvent the threat of Sotomayor, he was exiled from Cavite to Oton, Iloilo on 30 December 1668. While Coloma remained in the city, the associates of de la Peña terrorized his wife so that he could not act on the matter. Meanwhile, the governor appointed two licentiates, Juan de Rosales and Eugenio Gutierrez de Mendoza, to decide on the seniority of Coloma and Sotomayor. However, it was beyond the knowledge of de la Peña that King Charles II of Spain already appointed a new governor on 24 June 1668. He arrived in the Philippines by July 1669, and when he took office in Manila on 24 September of the same year, he put all those involved in the coup to trial. In 1670, he presided over the residencia of Salcedo, which was delayed by the coup two years ago. However, a protest was filed to the Council of the Indies regarding this review. Since he was <b>senior</b> <b>auditor</b> during the Salcedo administration, he was also the governor's asesor (legal adviser). All advice on the governor's acts came from Coloma. In essence, he would be reviewing his own acts. In 1671, Coloma's appointment to take the residencia was cancelled and Sotomayor took over Salcedo's residencia. As for Salcedo, he died while being transported to Mexico for trial.|$|E

Utilizing psychology based theories, an experimental task was conducted to investigate whether the manager’s feedback orientation (positive/negative and tasks/goals) within a <b>senior</b> <b>auditor’s</b> performance evaluation will increase an auditor’s self-esteem and professional skepticism. Results show that positive and goal-oriented performance evaluations do increase an auditor’s self-esteem and supportive performance evaluations increase an auditor’s professional skepticism.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper {{explains}} the positive side of role stress which has long been regarded as the factor causing performance decrease and ultimately initiates job dissatisfaction. There are many cause factors (antecedent) of role stress such as boundary-spanning activities, ethical climate in organization, mentoring, and organization-professional conflict, which has been proven empirically affecting role stress. Role stress arising in the job relation between manager-subordinate or leader-his or her member is a dynamic process in organization. Role stress becomes potential resource for organization if manager or leader is able to manage it well, so he or she can change it from hygiene factor to motivator. This article tries to correlate role stress phenomenon in public accountant firms with motivation theories to give alternatives in resolving problems in the role stress. Role stress can become a motivator for partners or <b>senior</b> <b>auditors</b> to be able to suit job characteristics and reward/punishment award mechanism with personal characteristics of auditors, reduce boundary spanning activities and environment uncertainty perception, increase understanding among all individuals in the public accountant firm regarding demand, values, and norms of the said public accountant firm, and ultimately establish specific and attainable goals. This article aims to be a contribution for management (partners and <b>senior</b> <b>auditors)</b> in motivating auditors to increase their performance and for researchers to inspire empiric research related to role stress as a motivator to increase performance. </p...|$|R
