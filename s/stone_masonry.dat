5|$|Buildings in Chamba were {{traditionally}} constructed using local materials. Buildings {{were made}} out of dry <b>stone</b> <b>masonry,</b> with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow-dung. Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden cantilever construction was often used to support the verandas. The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night. Before {{the arrival of the}} British, who introduced slate roofs to Chamba, roofs were covered with planks, coated in clay. Few of these houses remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.|$|E

A diagnostic study on historic monuments and buildings, situated in Greece, is performed. Long-wave infrared thermography (8 - 12 mum) is applied on advanced and historic materials regarding architectural surfaces and historic structures for research purposes such as: (i) The assessment of humidity impact on porous <b>stone</b> <b>masonries</b> (ii) The evaluation of conservation interventions (materials and techniques) regarding: consolidation interventions on porous <b>stone</b> <b>masonries</b> restoration of masonries by repair mortars cleaning of facades...|$|R

Diagnostic studies on monuments and historic buildings, situated in Greece, were performed. Long wave {{infrared thermography}} was used on restoration and traditional-historic materials concerning architectural surfaces and historic structures for research purposes such as: The assessment of moisture impact to porous <b>stone</b> <b>masonries</b> and the evaluation of conservation interventions (materials and techniques) regarding, consolidation interventions on porous <b>stone</b> <b>masonries,</b> restoration of masonries by repair mortars, and cleaning of facades.

5|$|The Church of Scotland, a Presbyterian Church, {{known as}} 'St. Andrew’s Church', was {{established}} by the first missionary in Chamba, the Reverend William Ferguson, who served there between 1863 and 1873. The foundation stone for building the new church was laid by the Raja of Chamba on 17 February 1899, {{in the presence of}} the Scottish reverend Dr. M’Clymont who had come from Scotland. The Raja had contributed a generous grant to build the church and ensured that it was exquisitely built in fine <b>stone</b> <b>masonry.</b> The walls are supported by buttresses, and lancer arch windows provide the light and ventilation. Several schools are run by the Mission located within the church precincts.|$|E
5|$|The Great New York City Fire of 1845 was {{the last}} of three {{particularly}} devastating fires that affected the heart of Manhattan, the other two occurring in 1776 and 1835. While very destructive, the 1845 fire confirmed the value of building codes restricting wood-frame construction. In 1815, city officials had banned new construction of wood-frame structures in the densest areas of the city. The 1845 fire demonstrated the efficacy of these restrictions, as the progress of the fire was checked when it spread toward areas rebuilt after the 1835 fire with such materials as <b>stone,</b> <b>masonry,</b> and iron roofs and shutters. In spite of general improvements, the 1845 fire prompted public calls for a more proactive stance in fire prevention and firefighting.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Lake (also {{known as}} Harvey Lake or Harvey's Lake) {{is a natural}} lake in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. It has a surface area of {{approximately}} 621.5 acres, or nearly a square mile. The lake is situated entirely within the borough of Harveys Lake. By volume, {{it is the largest}} natural lake in Pennsylvania, and by surface area, is the second-largest lake. It is a glacial lake surrounded by hills and is the source of Harveys Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River. The lake has a <b>stone</b> <b>masonry</b> dam. The lake's watershed has an area of approximately 3600 acres. The majority of the watershed is forested, but there is some developed land as well. Nearly all of the developed land is close to the lake itself, and the lake is surrounded entirely by a paved road.|$|E

Not all carvings of ships, suns, and footprints have survived, however.

On {{the south}} side is a slate tablet inscribed with a quotation from the account by Lord Clarendon (1609–1674) in his History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England of the Battle of Lansdowne (1643). On the north side are two poems. On top is a griffin (the crest and supporters of the Grenvilles) holding an escutcheon displaying the Grenville coat of arms: Gules, three clarions or. On another side are shown the Royal Arms of King Charles II (1660–1685) supported by the arms of Sir Bevil's eldest son and heir John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628–1701) and by {{the arms of the}} latter's half first cousin General George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, KG (1608–1670). Monck was the principal figure behind the Restoration of the Monarchy to King Charles II in 1660, in effecting which he was much assisted by Sir John Grenville, for which services both were elevated to the peerage.|$|E

40|$|Distinct Element SW {{packages}} can {{be devoted}} to the numerical analysis of masonry structures. This fact has suggested carrying out several numerical tests to check their efficiency {{in the analysis of}} the mechanical behavior of three-leaf <b>stone</b> <b>masonries.</b> By means of a Distinct Element Code, numerical models of some physical samples have been performed. The numerical analysis aims to detect the shear transfer capacity of different types of leaves connections: with and without offset. The comparison between the numerical and experimental results gives indications for the constitutive modeling of the mechanical response for both cases of interface connection. Moreover the effects of stress concentration due to the presence of offsets and its influence on collapse condition have been investigated...|$|R
