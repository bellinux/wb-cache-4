5|$|So Beautiful or <b>So</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> twelfth solo studio album by American folk rock singer-songwriter Paul Simon. For the album, he {{reunited with}} former {{collaborator}} and record producer Phil Ramone. Having experimented with rhythm-based textures {{for much of}} the previous two decades, Simon returned to composing songs rather traditionally using only his acoustic guitar. These songs were further augmented by experimental recording practices in the studio. The album was largely recorded in a small cottage at Simon's home in New Canaan, Connecticut.|$|E
