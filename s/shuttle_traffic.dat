My research addresses both of these challenges. (i) I designed new techniques for the verification of concurrent programs. Traditional methods, like software testing, are ineffective for concurrent software, increasing the need for verification tools. (ii) Along with colleagues at Wisconsin, I designed a model checker for machine code.

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of space station {{applications}} for tethers were reviewed.

The consequences of this transfer is studied and how beneficial use can be made of it...|$|E

5000|$|Outside France, LGV-type lines often carry non-TGV {{intercity}} traffic, {{often as}} a requirement of the initial funding commitments. The Belgian LGV from Brussels to Liège carries 200 km/h loco-hauled trains, with both the Dutch HSL-Zuid and British High Speed 1 planned to carry 225 km/h domestic intercity services and 300 km/h international services. The Channel Tunnel is not an LGV, but it uses LGV-type TVM signalling for mixed freight, <b>shuttle</b> and Eurostar <b>traffic</b> at between 100 and 160 km/h. The standard pathway for allocation purposes is the time taken by a Eurotunnel shuttle train (maximum speed 140 km/h) to traverse the tunnel. A single Eurostar running at 160 km/h occupies 2.67 standard paths; a second Eurostar running 3 minutes behind the first [...] "costs" [...] only a single additional path, so Eurostar services are often flighted 3 minutes apart between London and Lille. A freight train running at 120 km/h occupies 1.33 paths, at 100 km/h 3 paths. This illustrates the problem of mixed traffic at different speeds.|$|R
40|$|DARPP- 32 (PPP 1 R 1 B) was {{discovered}} {{as a substrate}} of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) enriched in dopamine-innervated brain areas. It is one of 3 related PKA-regulated inhibitors of protein phosphatase- 1 (PP 1). These inhibitors seem to have appeared in early vertebrate ancestors, possibly Gnathostomes. DARPP- 32 has additional important biochemical properties including inhibition of PKA when phosphorylated by Cdk 5 and regulation by casein kinases 1 and 2. It is highly enriched in specific neuronal populations, especially striatal medium-size spiny neurons. As PP 1 inhibitor DARPP- 32 amplifies and/or mediates many actions of PKA at the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm, with {{a broad spectrum of}} targets and functions. DARPP- 32 also undergoes a continuous and tightly regulated cytonuclear <b>shuttling.</b> This <b>trafficking</b> is controlled by phosphorylation of Ser- 97, which is necessary for nuclear export. When phosphorylated on Thr- 34 and dephosphorylated on Ser- 97, DARPP- 32 can inhibit PP 1 in the nucleus and modulate signaling pathways involved in the regulation of chromatin response. Recent work with multiple transgenic and knockout mutant mice has allowed the dissection of DARPP- 32 function in striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons. It is implicated in the action of therapeutic and abused psychoactive drugs, in prefrontal cortex function, and in sexual behavior. However, the contribution of DARPP- 32 in human behavior remains poorly understood. Post-mortem studies in humans suggest possible alterations of DARPP- 32 levels in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Genetic studies have revealed a polymorphism with possible association with psychological and psychopathological traits. In addition, a short isoform of DARPP- 32, t-DARPP, plays a role in cancer, indicating additional signaling properties. Thus, DARPP- 32 is a non-essential but tightly regulated signaling hub molecule which may improve the general performance of the neuronal circuits in which it is expressed...|$|R

It is a thoroughly modern, four-lane highway bridge, adequate {{in every respect}} for present day high speed passenger and transport traffic. The structure is ideally situated to provide rapid transit between the business districts of Rock Island and Davenport and serves not only the local or <b>shuttle</b> <b>traffic</b> in the Tri-City Area, but also heavy through motor travel on U.

The main spans are box girder rib tied arches, a type rather unusual in America and permitting simplicity in design with pleasing appearance. The Centennial Bridge is the only bridge across the Mississippi providing for four lanes of traffic with separation of traffic in each direction. It is a toll bridge operating alongside a free bridge and has the lowest rates of toll of any toll bridge on the Mississippi River. It was financed entirely by the City of Rock Island with no obligation on the taxpayers; there was no federal or state participation in the financing. But perhaps the most outstanding feature of the new bridge is its great need. A few remarks on the communities served by the new structure, the services rendered, and some statistics on cross-river traffic in the Tri-City Area will emphasize the reasons for constructing the Centennial Bridge...|$|E

5000|$|The {{biological}} function of ERGIC2 protein is unknown, {{although it was}} initially identified as a candidate tumor suppressor of prostate cancer, and {{has been shown to}} induce cell growth arrest and senescence, to suppress colony formation in soft agar, and to decrease invasive potential of human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3 cells). [...] It is now believed to be a chaperon molecule involved in protein trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi. The protein contains two hydrophobic transmembrane domains that help anchoring the molecule on the ER membrane, such that its large luminal domain orients inside the ER lumen and both the N- and C-termini are facing the cytosol. ERGIC2 forms a complex with two other proteins, ERGIC3 and ERGIC32, resulting in a <b>shuttle</b> for protein <b>trafficking</b> between ER and Golgi. [...] It has been shown to interact with a number of proteins, such as beta-amyloid, protein elongation factor 1alpha, and otoferlin. Therefore, it may {{play an important role in}} cellular functions besides of being a component of a protein trafficking shuttle.More recently, a variant transcript of ERGIC2 has been reported. [...] It has a deletion of four bases at the junction of exons 8 and 9, resulting a frame-shift mutation after codon #189. The variant transcript encodes a truncated protein of 215 residues, which loses 45% of the luminal domain and the transmembrane domain near the C-terminus. This effectively abrogates its function as a protein transporter. A similar variant is also reported in armadillo. So this is not a random mutation. The function of this truncated protein is unknown.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of the Environment, Washington State UniversityNational park {{management}} encounters {{the challenge}} of conserving the park unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. Many national parks {{in the world are}} faced with resource degradation due to overcrowding on roads and trails. The Going-to-the-Sun Road of Glacier National Park in Montana has undergone the same situation, especially after the high increase in visitation over the years since its first completion in 1932. During the rehabilitation project of the road starting from 2007, a free shuttle system was introduced to reduce road congestion. The operation of the shuttle system has received contrasting feedbacks from users, park staff and researchers. The continuation of the shuttle is best considered within the larger context of planning for the Going to the Sun Road corridor. Planning issues, including questions on the shuttle, can be addressed through the use of System Dynamics simulation. In order to evaluate the effect of the shuttle system on road and trail use, a System Dynamics model was built for a typical busy day in July. The model helps reveal visitor behavior and explore possible policies to improve road and trail management. Three sub-models are linked together including the <b>Traffic</b> sub-model, <b>Shuttle</b> sub-model and Trail sub-model. Results suggest that the <b>shuttle</b> helps reduce <b>traffic</b> congestion but does not lessen parking lot congestion. The main reason is because a significant number of cars fail to park and the number highly exceeds parking lot capacity. The shuttle also puts more people on trails and the Logan Pass Visitor Center. The increase ranges from 18 to 22 %. Further analysis reveals that when there are more annual visitors, major parking lots will become full earlier and stay full longer during the day. Increased annual visitation will add more people on trails but the increase is minimal due to limited parking space at Logan Pass. In addition, making the Logan Pass Visitor Center more attractive to lengthen visiting time would indirectly reduce the number of car people on surrounding trails.
