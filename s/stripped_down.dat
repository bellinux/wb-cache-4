5|$|During the Cold War, {{its role}} in the event of war would have been as a medium {{reconnaissance}} unit for the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). In 1971, a second Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry-based squadron was raised, as B squadron, Royal Wessex Yeomanry. This was initially a home defence unit trained as infantry, but later equipped with <b>stripped</b> <b>down</b> Land Rovers to perform reconnaissance duties.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Stuart, an Army {{captain who}} served as the last {{governor}} of the castle, <b>stripped</b> <b>down</b> what remained of the fortification in the mid-1700s. Some of the stone was reused to build the Bowling Green House – later renamed the Castle Inn – on {{the north end of the}} tennis courts, while the north side of the outer bailey was used to make the bowling green itself. Stuart lived in a house in Ludlow itself, but decorated the Great Hall with the remains of the castle armoury, and may have charged visitors for admittance.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Hell Awaits, Slayer was offered a {{recording}} contract with Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin's newly founded Def Jam Records, a largely hip hop-based label. The band accepted and with an experienced producer and major label recording budget, the band underwent a sonic makeover for their third album Reign in Blood resulting in shorter, faster songs with clearer production. Gone were the complex arrangements and long songs featured on Hell Awaits, ditched in favor of <b>stripped</b> <b>down,</b> hardcore punk influenced song structures.|$|E

5|$|On 6 November, Thunderer {{was sold}} for scrap to Messrs, Hughes, Bolckow & Co. for £66,150. She was too deep in draught to enter their {{scrapyard}} in Blyth {{and so was}} partially <b>stripped</b> <b>down</b> at Rosyth. Even so, she grounded at the Blyth harbour entrance on 24 December. After she was refloated on 30 December, {{she went back to}} Rosyth to be further lightened, as her draught was still too deep to allow her to enter Blyth. She was towed from Rosyth on 12 April 1927 and reached Blyth two days later to finish demolition.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the album, Manson {{sings in}} a {{different}} key than {{on any of the}} band's previous releases. He has claimed that his voice can emit five different tones simultaneously, and that mixing engineer Robert Carranza showed him that a recording of his vocals formed a visual pentagram when imported into a phrasal analyzer. Bates has said that the vocals on the album are <b>stripped</b> <b>down</b> in comparison to previous records, which he considered to be overproduced.|$|E
5|$|In 1660 Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne and ownership of the castles changed once again. Beaumaris {{was restored}} to {{the control of the}} Bulkeley family, traditionally the constables of the castle, who promptly stripped the castle of any remaining materials, including the roofs, and Conwy was returned to the Conway family, who <b>stripped</b> <b>down</b> the castle for lead and timber, reducing it to a ruin as well. Charles' new government regarded Caernarfon's castle and town walls as a security risk and ordered them to be destroyed, but this order was never carried out, possibly because of the costs involved in doing so.|$|E

5|$|In Boston, an {{undercover}} cop {{waits for the}} subway, alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping the fare barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes to a screeching halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when the train is back up and running, a batch of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm <b>stripped</b> <b>down</b> to the bone.|$|E
5|$|In a {{gameplay}} mode {{exclusive to}} Western releases, the Arcade mode converts {{the game in}} a traditional fighting game, with all RPG elements removed and characters' abilities being <b>stripped</b> <b>down</b> to the basics to balance the playing field. Within the Arcade Mode, there are three tiers: Normal, Hard, and Time Attack; beating any tier of the Arcade mode will reward the player with PP (player points) and special items {{that can be used}} in story mode. All characters, including villains, are playable in Arcade mode; for example, Golbez, Sephiroth, Kuja, and Jecht are available for use in this mode from the start, but they still need to be bought via the PP Catalog for use in other modes.|$|E

Gaga performed <b>stripped</b> <b>down,</b> acoustic {{versions of}} four songs from her second studio album, Born This Way, {{along with two}} Christmas songs and a duet with Bennett. The special received critical acclaim and gave ABC its best ratings in four years for its respective time slot on Thanksgiving Day. At the 2012 Dorian Awards, the special was nominated {{in the category of}} Best TV Musical Program of the Year, but did not win the award. A live EP of performances from the special, titled A Very Gaga Holiday, was made available for purchase from the iTunes Store. The EP debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number52.|$|E

5|$|After docking in Kiel, the {{men from}} Asar-i Tevfik were {{transferred}} to İzmir, but with no funds to buy coal, the men were stranded in Germany. Germaniawerft <b>stripped</b> <b>down</b> Asar-i Tevfik, but then halted work to await the first Ottoman payment. By mid-1901, the men had accumulated significant debt and the Ottoman government had {{made no effort to}} return them or pay the installments for the modernization program. Even Kaiser Wilhelm II became involved in an attempt to press the Ottoman government to settle the debts incurred by the sailors. Instead, the Ottomans demanded that Krupp, the owner of the Germaniawerft shipyard, make an advance of 6,000lira so that İzmir could be prepared for the voyage back to Constantinople. The Ottomans were at the time negotiating for a large armament contract with Krupp for the Army, and used this as leverage; by late 1901, Krupp conceded, rather than risk the lucrative contract. The debts in Kiel were paid and İzmir finally departed for home.|$|E
5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he <b>stripped</b> <b>down</b> five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E
5|$|During the Californication world tour, Frusciante {{continued}} to compose his own songs, {{many of which}} would be released in 2001 on his third solo album To Record Only Water for Ten Days. The album was stylistically unlike his previous records, less markedly stream-of-consciousness or avant-garde. However, the lyrics were still very cryptic and its sound was notably <b>stripped</b> <b>down.</b> The songwriting and production of To Record Only Water for Ten Days were more efficient and straightforward than on his previous recordings. The album strayed from the alternative rock he had just written with the Chili Peppers on Californication, focusing more on electronic and new wave elements. In addition to his guitar work, Frusciante experimented with a variety of synthesizers, a distinctive feature of the record.|$|E

5|$|Reluctantly, Dowding defined three categories, A, B and C. Category A {{units were}} {{to bear the}} brunt of the fighting, and were to be kept at full {{strength}} in aircraft and pilots. Only if the A units suffered exceptionally high losses would they be replaced. B units were relief units, to be maintained at operational strength and only used if absolutely necessary. C units were generally <b>stripped</b> <b>down</b> to just five or six pilots. These units were devoted to training new pilots. Although not fit for fighter-fighter action, they could defend quieter areas. The system potentially could have had fatal results for Fighter Command, with C units becoming less and less effective. But the system had not been running long enough by 14 September for it to have a serious impact on Fighter Command's strength. The replacement units were sufficient in number and effectiveness to continue to replace exhausted units. By 15 September, the C units could still give a good account of themselves in battle.|$|E
5|$|Retiring {{from the}} {{encounter}} with Blenheim, Linois sailed westwards and arrived in Simon's Bay at the Dutch colony of Cape Town on 13 September. He was hoping there to join up with the Dutch squadron maintained at the Cape, but discovered that the only significant Dutch warship in the port was the ship of the line Bato, which was <b>stripped</b> <b>down</b> and unfit for service at sea. Repairing the damage suffered in the August engagement and replenishing food and naval stores {{over the next two}} months, Linois was joined in October by Atalante. On 5 November a gale swept the bay and Atalante dragged her anchors, Captain Gaudin-Beauchène powerless to prevent his frigate driving ashore and rapidly becoming a total wreck. The crew were able to escape to shore in small boats and were then divided among Marengo and Belle Poule, with 160 men left to augment the garrison at Cape Town. Linois's prize, the Brunswick, too was wrecked near Simon's Bay.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} closed to motor {{vehicles}} on 15 February 2010 for refurbishment and strengthening. It was originally expected to remain closed for approximately 18 months, but after {{the condition of the}} bridge was found to be worse than expected, it was closed for 22 months. All of the timber in the decking as well as the footway that had rotted away were replaced, with additional timber added for strengthening. Surfaces at the carriageway and pavement decking were replaced. New steel structures were added to strengthen the bridge. All the lightbulbs were changed to more energy-efficient ones. The tollbooths were refurbished. All twelve layers of paint were <b>stripped</b> <b>down</b> until the bare metal was exposed, which was repaired and treated before three new coats of paint were added. The whole project cost £7.2 million of which the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea provided 25% of the cost and the other 75% was provided by Transport for London.|$|E

5|$|The {{field of}} the stadium {{combines}} a number of elements {{for use in the}} jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high jump is a <b>stripped</b> <b>down</b> version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.|$|E
5|$|The {{first show}} of Tears of a Clown started four hours late, with the delay being caused by Madonna rehearsing. It {{consisted}} of Madonna singing acoustic versions of her songs while {{dressed as a}} clown, interspersed with the singer telling jokes and anecdotes. Tears of a Clown received positive reviews from critics who appreciated the <b>stripped</b> <b>down,</b> confessional nature of the singer's performance and {{the choice of the}} songs and the comedy. Madonna refuted reports of her being drunk on stage, calling them false and sexist. She revived the show on December 2, 2016, performing at Miami's Faena Forum as a benefit gala, to auction memorabilia and raise money for her Raising Malawi charitable foundation. Tickets were expensive, and the auctioned items included Madonna's tour dress and wedding photographs, as well as paintings that she owned.|$|E
5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really <b>stripped</b> <b>down</b> and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E
