40|$|Abstrac:- This paper {{describes}} a new method for authenticating and encrypting messages. Our method employs any encryption algorithm as underlying block cipher. Proposed algorithm uses two key values, first key for the underlying encryption algorithm, and the <b>second</b> <b>key</b> {{for the new}} mode. The proven security describes the attacker inability to forge the new Encryption-Authentication algorithm, {{in terms of his}} (presumed) inability to break the underlying random S-box, the <b>second</b> <b>key,</b> and the underlying encryption function...|$|R
40|$|On one key, pigeons' pecks were {{reinforced}} {{according to}} a variable-interval schedule {{in the presence of}} vertical lines, and were not reinforced in the presence of oblique lines. On a <b>second</b> <b>key,</b> pecks were reinforced {{according to a}} variable-interval schedule in the presence of blue, according to a signalled variable-interval schedule in the presence of red, and were not reinforced in the presence of white. Subsequently, during extinction, stimulus-control gradients were obtained by presenting eight different line orientations on the first key concurrent with each of the three colors on the <b>second</b> <b>key.</b> On the first key, line-orientation gradients tended to be lower, narrower, and less shifted in peak or area when the second-key stimulus was blue or red, the stimuli respectively correlated with unsignalled and signalled reinforcement, than when it was white, the stimulus correlated with extinction. Thus, the effect on first-key line-orientation gradients depended on second-key stimuli correlated with concurrent reinforcement, whether or not these stimuli were also correlated with concurrent responding. As a function of first-key line orientation, an inverted gradient was obtained on the <b>second</b> <b>key</b> during blue; during both red and white, rates of pecking on the <b>second</b> <b>key</b> were near zero...|$|R

40|$|Behavioral {{momentum}} theory relates {{resistance to change}} of responding in a multiple-schedule component to the total reinforcement obtained in that component, regardless of how the reinforcers are produced. Four pigeons responded {{in a series of}} multiple-schedule conditions in which a variable-interval 40 -s schedule arranged reinforcers for pecking in one component and a variable-interval 360 -s schedule arranged them in the other. In addition, responses on a <b>second</b> <b>key</b> were reinforced according to variable-interval schedules that were equal in the two components. In different parts of the experiment, responding was disrupted by changing the rate of reinforcement on the <b>second</b> <b>key</b> or by delivering response-independent food during a blackout separating the two components. Consistent with {{momentum theory}}, responding on the first key in Part 1 changed more in the component with the lower reinforcement total when it was disrupted by changes in the rate of reinforcement on the <b>second</b> <b>key.</b> However, responding on the <b>second</b> <b>key</b> changed more in the component with the higher reinforcement total. In Parts 2 and 3, responding was disrupted with free food presented during intercomponent blackouts, with extinction (Part 2) or variable-interval 80 -s reinforcement (Part 3) arranged on the <b>second</b> <b>key.</b> Here, resistance to change was greater for the component with greater overall reinforcement. Failures of momentum theory to predict short-term differences in resistance to change occurred with disruptors that caused greater change between steady states for the richer component. Consistency of effects across disruptors may yet be found if short-term effects of disruptors are assessed relative to the extent of change observed after prolonged exposure...|$|R
