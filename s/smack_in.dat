500|$|In 2009, Aronofsky {{reflected}} on the reception of The Fountain, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} Fountain-haters out [...] The film's about the fact that it's OK that we die, and we should come to terms with it. But many, many people don't want to think about that, so why pay money for a meditation on losing someone you love? Everything about western culture denies that." [...] He also believed the film was released at the wrong time, [...] "It was pre-Obama, <b>smack</b> <b>in</b> the middle of Paris Hilton time. But there has been a serious turn now, people are starting to realise that the party's over, finally. So we can stop thinking about the culture of superficiality, start to remember there are other things going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Woodhouse {{was born}} in Beverley and raised in Driffield. His father, Bernard Woodhouse, {{died at the age}} of 51 after he had a fatal stroke. Unlike other boys who idolised footballers, Woodhouse stated his heroes were Nigel Benn and Mike Tyson. He admits to {{fighting}} at school and in the streets after being racially abused: [...] "I went from scrapping in the street and at school to fighting in the boxing ring from the age of 12. I was called a few names due to the colour of my skin, but with a quick <b>smack</b> <b>in</b> the mouth they soon backed off." [...] He used to visit Boothferry Park to support Hull City before pursuing his career in professional football. He has a wife, Charlotte, and two children: a son named Kyle and a daughter, Isla.|$|E

5000|$|Introduced in 1953, {{the cereal}} has {{undergone}} several name changes. It {{started out as}} Sugar <b>Smacks.</b> <b>In</b> the 1980s, it was renamed Honey <b>Smacks.</b> <b>In</b> the early 1990s, perhaps because the product mascot, Dig'em Frog, had customarily been portrayed as calling the cereal [...] "Smacks", the word [...] "Honey" [...] was dropped from the name and the product was then simply called Smacks. That name is still used in Germany, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, where a box was featured in the film Alphaville. However, in the US the name reverted to Honey <b>Smacks</b> <b>in</b> 2004. In the UK in 1957, a similar product called Sugar Puffs debuted; it was formerly produced by the Quaker Oats Company and now by Big Bear trading as Honey Monster Foods.|$|R

500|$|Fuming, Sinatra began what The Los Angeles Times {{describes}} as a [...] "weekend-long tirade" [...] against the [...] "hotel's management, employees and security forces". The FBI report says the incident began when Mia Farrow lost US$20,000 at the Sands casino. Sinatra bought US$50,000 in chips and made an attempt to win the money back. [...] He lost this sum within {{a short period of}} time. [...] Sinatra then asked for credit, which was denied. It culminated when Sinatra reportedly drove a golf cart through the window of the coffee shop where casino manager Carl Cohen was seated and began [...] "screaming obscenities and anti-Semitic remarks" [...] at Cohen. Sinatra reportedly punched Cohen, a heavily built man, who responded with a <b>smack</b> <b>in</b> the mouth, bloodying Sinatra's nose and knocking two of his teeth out. [...] As a result, Sinatra never performed at the Sands again while Hughes owned it, and began performing at Caesars Palace. A number of the staff were not disappointed to see Sinatra leave the Sands. Numerous employees had been humiliated or intimidated over the years, including a busboy Sinatra tripped while he was carrying a tray with dishes. After Sinatra left, the mobsters pulled out of the Sands and gradually left Vegas in the 1970s. [...] In the 1970s it became associated with the likes of Wayne Newton and Liberace. At this time some 30% of the performers at Sands were Italian Americans. Frank Gagliardi became the drummer for the house orchestra in 1964, starting a twelve-year tenure.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{representatives of}} {{organized}} religion {{have criticized the}} practice of spirituality without religiosity. Lillian Daniel, a liberal Protestant minister, has characterized the SBNR worldview {{as a product of}} secular American consumer culture, far removed from community and [...] "right <b>smack</b> <b>in</b> the bland majority of people who find ancient religions dull but find themselves uniquely fascinating". James Martin, a Jesuit priest, has called the SBNR lifestyle [...] "plain old laziness", stating that [...] "spirituality without religion can become a self-centered complacency divorced from the wisdom of a community".|$|E

2500|$|On 28 March 2004, Thomson {{reported}} Saatchi to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) {{for alleged}} breaches of the Competition Act and cited {{as an example}} Saatchi's promotion of Vine, a situation which [...] made the row [...] "more bitter". The OFT {{said they did not}} [...] "have reasonable grounds to suspect that Charles Saatchi is in a dominant position in any relevant market", which Thomson said was [...] "just another cruel <b>smack</b> <b>in</b> the face" [...] for Saatchi. In September 2004, Vine threatened suicide if her work was included in The Stuckists Punk Victorian show at the Liverpool Biennial, and the owner of the painting withdrew it.|$|E

60|$|Behind {{him as he}} {{was halfway}} up the inn steps he heard a sudden yell of rage, rising sharply out of the {{confusion}} of cries, and a sounding <b>smack</b> <b>in</b> someone's face.

60|$|The way in which, {{ever and}} anon, Chimbolo kissed his poor but now happy wife, was wondrously {{similar to the}} mode in which white men perform that little operation, except {{that there was more}} of an {{unrefined}} <b>smack</b> <b>in</b> it. The tears which would hop over his sable cheeks now and then sparkled to the full as brightly as European tears, and were perhaps somewhat bigger; and the pride with which he regarded his little son, holding him in both hands out at arms'-length, was only excelled by the joy and the tremendous laugh with which he received a kick on the nose from that undutiful son's black little toes.|$|E

60|$|For {{there was}} a deal of piratical <b>smack</b> <b>in</b> the anti-Spanish ventures of Elizabethan days. Many of the adventurers--of the Sir Francis Drake school, for instance--actually overstepped again and again the bounds of {{international}} law, entering into the realms of de facto piracy. Nevertheless, while their doings were not recognized officially by the government, the perpetrators were neither punished nor reprimanded for their excursions against Spanish commerce {{at home or in}} the West Indies; rather were they commended, and it was considered not altogether a discreditable thing for men to get rich upon the spoils taken from Spanish galleons in times of nominal peace. Many of the most reputable citizens and merchants of London, when they felt that the queen failed in her duty of pushing the fight against the great Catholic Power, fitted out fleets upon their own account and sent them to levy good Protestant war of a private nature upon the Pope's anointed.|$|E
