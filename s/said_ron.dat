500|$|Steve Kandell of New York {{magazine}} {{praised the}} episode, {{and said the}} kiss between Leslie and Ben was emotionally effective. He said Chris' obliviousness to the sexual tension between Leslie and Ben seemed unusual, but wrote, [...] "Maybe {{this is just another}} case of a show hitting so many perfect notes that the slightest deviation seems off-key." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN said [...] "Road Trip" [...] was less funny than [...] "The Fight", and that the Know Ya Boo subplot [...] "fizzled a bit". But he called it a [...] "sweet episode" [...] for its developments with Leslie and Ben, and <b>said</b> <b>Ron</b> and Chris were especially funny in their scenes. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said [...] "Road Trip" [...] was [...] "pretty great" [...] but less funny than the previous episode, [...] "The Fight". She praised the Ron subplot, but said Tom's game show was [...] "much more predictable and rote".|$|E
500|$|With his {{aggressive}} running style which favored {{running over}} players instead of around them, questions began to arise over how long Campbell could stay healthy. [...] "He runs {{with a lot}} of reckless abandon," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Ron</b> Johnson, a former running back whose own career was cut short. [...] "You can run like that in college. But you can't do that for 10 years and hope to survive." [...] Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris said [...] "Knocking over people can look very good but you can't do it forever. Sometimes it's going to be somebody else who knocks you over ... so the most important thing I think isn't to get a few extra yards every time but to make sure you're healthy enough to play." [...] Bum Phillips, though, favored Campbell's running style. [...] "I've been looking for a back like Earl," [...] he said. [...] "I'm not going to change his style. Why would I? You don't want a guy who gets hit and then flops on the ground. Earl does the same thing other backs do, only better." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Ron Swanson received critical acclaim; {{he developed a}} cult following and is widely considered the show's breakout character. Joel Keller of TV Squad called Ron [...] "one of the more inspired sitcom characters of the last decade," [...] Zap2it writer Joel Keller called {{him one of the}} best sitcom characters since Cosmo Kramer of Seinfeld, and Geoff Berkshire of Variety said that the character would [...] "go down in TV history as one of the all-time comedy greats." [...] Gabriel Perna of International Business Times wrote, [...] "Offerman's Ron Swanson {{is one of the main}} reasons to watch Parks and Recreation. Considering how funny the show is and the scope of its cast, that says a lot." [...] Likewise, Gail Pennington, television critic with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, called Nick Offerman [...] "the funniest guy on TV," [...] and TV Fanatic writer Eric Hochberger said, [...] "There's certain character I watch this show for: Ron Swanson." [...] Jonah Weiner of Slate.com <b>said</b> <b>Ron</b> [...] "has regularly stolen his scenes" [...] and that Offerman has [...] "a gift for understated physical comedy," [...] and Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said Offerman was not only funny, but capable of expressing a surprising range of emotions.|$|E
50|$|During {{his work}} on Futurama, supervising {{director}} Rich Moore <b>said</b> that <b>Ron</b> had directed {{some of the best}} scenes of violence on the show. This was noted on the audio commentary of Raging Bender.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the {{criticism}} of ParoleWatch was more tongue-in-cheek. [...] "A better name for the Web site address is www.rotinjail.com," [...] <b>said</b> activist attorney <b>Ron</b> Kuby.|$|R
5000|$|... "It's been {{so amazing}} {{to see how}} {{disabled}} winter sports have grown {{over the years and}} I'm really proud of how much we've achieved," [...] <b>Ron</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
500|$|... "Flu Season" [...] also {{demonstrated}} a departure {{in the way}} Ann's romantic relationships were handled compared to past seasons. The character previously dated Andy Dwyer and Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), who was written out of the show {{at the end of}} the second season. In both cases, Ann was primarily in control of the relationship due to Andy's immaturity and Mark's lack of experience in long-term romances. Schur said of Ann's relationship with Chris, [...] "This is the first time that Ann just completely loses herself and really falls for a guy super hard. And the relationship goes in a lot of funny, unexpected directions." [...] Intimidated by her inability to find a flaw in the extremely positive and physically perfect Chris, Ann acts more awkwardly and nerdy around him than her character has been in the past. [...] "Flu Season" [...] {{also demonstrated}} deeper levels to Ron Swanson, who adamantly insists [...] "I'm not interested in caring about people", yet reveals he cares about both Andy and April, and tries to help the two reconcile. Schur <b>said</b> <b>Ron</b> takes on a sort of father figure role, [...] "and he ends up revealing in a tiny, tiny, tiny way that's still true to the character that he has genuine feelings of caring for the people who work around him in the Parks office".|$|E
2500|$|Atlantis docked {{with the}} ISS Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 at 15:07 UTC {{as the two}} orbited 220 miles (350km) over the South Pacific Ocean east of New Zealand. This was Atlantis's 19th docking to a Space Station. [...] "Houston, station, Atlantis, capture {{confirmed}} and we see free drift," [...] radioed Hurley, confirming the successful docking. In reply, [...] "Atlantis arriving," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Ron</b> Garan after the ceremonial ringing of the station's bell. [...] "Welcome to the International Space Station for the last time". A series of leak checks were done {{on both sides of}} the hatches, before they were opened at 16:47 UTC. Shortly afterwards, the shuttle crew floated into the station's Harmony module at 16:55 UTC. After a brief welcoming ceremony by the station crew, Atlantis's astronauts received the standard station safety briefing.|$|E

[...] "I had breakfast with him, and he was fine at breakfast...He went to his office, I went to mine and they found him unresponsive" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Ron</b> Godwin, the executive vice president of Falwell's Liberty University. His condition was initially reported as [...] "gravely serious"; CPR was administered unsuccessfully.

5000|$|The things I have <b>said</b> about L. <b>Ron</b> Hubbard in {{courts and}} the public prints have been grossly exaggerated or entirely false. I have not at any time {{believed}} otherwise than that L. Ron Hubbard is a fine and brilliant man.|$|R
5|$|On November 19, 2009, John Green, one of {{the fans}} who helped begin the brawl, {{appeared}} on ESPN First Take, where {{he talked about the}} incident and the changes he had made since then.

50|$|Across town Nancy {{comes to}} grips with the horrifying truth. She confesses to Chris that she unwittingly lied when she <b>said</b> <b>Ron</b> was home that night of the phone call.

500|$|Regarding {{candidates}} for the 2012 Republican primaries, Savage <b>said</b> that <b>Ron</b> Paul had [...] "great ideas" [...] but expressed hope that Rick Perry would be the nominee. On December 12, 2011, he offered Newt Gingrich [...] "1 million dollars" [...] {{to withdraw from the}} United States Presidential contest.

5000|$|Because of {{her work}} visiting Aboriginal prisoners, Mum Shirl is {{the only woman in}} Australia to have been given {{unrestricted}} access to prisons in New South Wales.

She used to rely on family and friends to get her around." [...] <b>said</b> <b>Ron</b> Woodham from NSW Corrective Services. Later the Department of Corrective Services revoked her pass, making her prisoner support work near impossible.|$|E
50|$|On May 18, {{just days}} later, The Museum of Modern Art in New York City honored the {{director}} with “Filmmaker in Focus: Euzhan Palcy” (May 18- May 30), the first retrospective {{of her career}} and “first retrospective of a black woman filmmaker at the MoMA”. The Department of Film has acquired for its collection new 35mm prints of Palcy’s “Rue Cases-Nègres” and “Siméon” (1992), her Caribbean musical-comedy fairytale—which by the closing credits of its New York premiere at MoMA last Friday had literally sparked dancing in the aisles of the theater <b>said</b> <b>Ron</b> Magliozzi, the assistant film curator of MoMA.|$|E

50|$|As {{was common}} with many road races, several road course ringers {{attempted}} to qualify. Two drivers, Boris <b>Said</b> and <b>Ron</b> Fellows, led their first Winston Cup laps during this race. Said, David Murry, and Ted Christopher made their first Winston Cup starts.

In addition, full-time Winston Cup driver Jerry Nadeau, who began his career on road courses, led his first career laps in a Winston Cup race.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the {{characters}} resembled parodies of well-known personalities: for example, Louis Balfour, host of [...] "Jazz Club" [...] was reminiscent of Bob Harris of The Old Grey Whistle Test and Ron Manager of football pundits Jimmy Hill, Trevor Brooking and Graham Taylor. However, the parodic intent of this character is broader, and portrays how often football pundits have little to say of any real substance and sometimes waffle. Paul Whitehouse <b>said</b> that <b>Ron</b> Manager was based on ex-Luton Town and Fulham manager Alec Stock. [...] Arthur Atkinson is a composite of Arthur Askey and Max Miller.|$|R
5000|$|George (2000, 88 minutes, Henry Corra, Grahame Weinbren) Described by Amy Taubin in The Village Voice, as [...] "an {{exceptionally}} {{intelligent and}} moving documentary that explores Corra’s twelve-year-old autistic son George, who uses his own video camera {{to make a}} movie within the movie. In fact, the film is about how we define normalcy." [...] George had its American theatrical premiere at The Screening Room, New York and was shown at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, The National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., The Gaga Film Festival, Berlin Germany. It aired on HBO in July 2000. [...] "The more you know, the more you care. The more you care, the more your heart will break," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Ron</b> Wertheimer in the New York Times.|$|E

5000|$|A {{review in}} the School Library Journal called the {{anthology}} [...] "refreshing" [...] and chose the stories by Lanagan and Maguire. The review cited the main character in William Sleator's [...] "Fingernail" [...] as [...] "compelling", and <b>said</b> <b>Ron</b> Koertge's [...] "My Life as a Dog" [...] contained [...] "an ingenious metaphor for coming out". Kirkus Reviews concluded that the book contained [...] "rovocative, quality content." [...] The journal cited Shanower's [...] "Happily Ever After" [...] and Block's [...] "My Virtual World" [...] as the best stories in the collection. Reviewer Gillian Engberg, writing in Booklist, found the experimentation in narrative styles [...] "inventive" [...] and the stories [...] "raw [...] moving", and concluded the anthology was [...] "a groundbreaking addition to young-adult literature". Erin Williams, reviewing {{the book of the}} PFLAG National Blog, found the collection [...] "unique" [...] because [...] "...the stories vary from spiritually philosophical to personal histories to comic strips—all dealing with teen GLBT experiences." ...|$|E

A mother is interrogating her son who [...] "has got to be sick" [...] and who requests that she [...] "lay him down to die". He tells her {{that he has been}} in the woods [...] "eating eels" [...] that are revealed to have actually been poisonous snakes, which kill him.

5000|$|Professionally {{known as}} [...] "Karel and Andrew", Bouley and Howard {{became the first}} openly gay radio talk-show hosts on a U.S. major-market radio station in 1998. Hired for the {{afternoon}} drive slot at Los Angeles' KFI, the duo replaced KFI mainstays John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou. [...] "I'm sure {{there are a million}} gay radio hosts, but not many of them are open, and no one had ever appeared on the air as a gay couple," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Ron</b> Rodrigues, editor-in-chief of Radio & Records magazine. [...] " [...] The backbone of their on-air banter was their contrasting world views. Bouley, who dominated the conversation, could be stopped in his tracks with one, well-placed word from Howard". Al Peterson, an editor at Radio & Records magazine said, [...] "They didn't feel like it was their job to be the poster boys for the gay community or to effect social change, just because they were the first openly gay hosts who were partners off the air." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. The London Free Press listed {{it as one}} of the [...] "best bets" [...] {{to watch}} the evening it originally aired. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the small-town government setting and story lines of the show were working, but felt the writing for the Leslie character has been uneven and that individual situations involving her in [...] "The Reporter" [...] were not funny or effective. Matt Fowler of IGN said the Leslie character was funny, particularly when she talks about her failure to remove graffiti penises from a city wall. ("To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises.") But Fowler said the Scrabble subplot between Tom and Ron was [...] "silly," [...] and <b>said</b> the <b>Ron</b> character is too one-note and unfunny.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, he {{received}} the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award from his peers. [...] "He's just an American success story," [...] <b>said</b> his agent <b>Ron</b> Anderson.

5000|$|The {{song was}} written almost fully by Ernie Isley with {{additional}} instrumental background composition by the band's keyboardist Chris Jasper.
