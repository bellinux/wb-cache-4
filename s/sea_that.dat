5|$|The rocks {{exposed in}} the park were formed in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods between 370and 340million years ago, when the land {{was part of the}} {{coastline}} of a shallow <b>sea</b> <b>that</b> covered a great portion of what is now North America.

5|$|Argon-argon radiometric dating {{indicates}} that the Kaiparowits Formation was deposited between 76.1 and 74.0million years ago, during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. During the Late Cretaceous period, {{the site of the}} Kaiparowits Formation was located near the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland <b>sea</b> <b>that</b> split North America into two landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland peat swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms. This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world.|$|E
5|$|Chinese geographers such as Jia Dan wrote {{accurate}} {{descriptions of}} places far abroad. In his work written between 785 and 805, {{he described the}} sea route going {{into the mouth of}} the Persian Gulf, and that the medieval Iranians (whom he called the people of Luo-He-Yi) had erected 'ornamental pillars' in the <b>sea</b> <b>that</b> acted as lighthouse beacons for ships that might go astray. Confirming Jia's reports about lighthouses in the Persian Gulf, Arabic writers a century after Jia wrote of the same structures, writers such as al-Mas'udi and al-Muqaddasi. The Tang dynasty Chinese diplomat Wang Xuance traveled to Magadha (modern northeastern India) during the 7th century. Afterwards he wrote the book Zhang Tianzhu Guotu (Illustrated Accounts of Central India), which included a wealth of geographical information.|$|E

5|$|Early {{in their}} history, Qatna and Yamhad had hostile relations; Amut-piʾel I, in {{alliance}} with Yahdun-Lim and Ḫammu-Nabiḫ (probably king of Tuttul), attacked the Yamhadite city of Tuba, {{which was a}} personal possession of Aleppo's royal family, and took a large booty. Later, Yahdun-Lim embarked on an expedition to the Mediterranean <b>Sea</b> <b>that</b> was used for ideological purposes, as {{it was meant to}} echo Gilgamesh's deeds; the journey likely had undeclared political motives as well, when seen {{in the context of the}} alliance with Qatna. The MarioteQaṭanean alliance, which was probably cemented by dynastic marriage, must have provoked Yamhad, which supported rebellions in Mari to preoccupy Yahdun-Lim with his own problems. Despite the tension and battles, a full-scale war with Yamhad was avoided.|$|E
5|$|Geologically the Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{was once}} {{part of a large}} and shallow <b>sea</b> <b>that</b> covered most of southern California. As the San Joaquin Hills rose and river sediments were deposited, land gradually emerged to form the present-day Orange County coast. Sulphur Creek is located in a crumpled, hilly area {{in the southern part of}} this range, formed differently from the continuous mountain chain to the north. Historically, being south of Aliso Creek, the Sulphur Creek watershed was part of the territory of the semi-nomadic Acjachemen Indian group, conquered by Spanish conquistadors in the 17th and 18th centuries and renamed the Juaneño by them.|$|E
5|$|H. altispinus {{shared the}} Horseshoe Canyon Formation with fellow hadrosaurids Edmontosaurus and Saurolophus, hypsilophodont Parksosaurus, ankylosaurid Anodontosaurus, nodosaurid Edmontonia, horned dinosaurs Montanoceratops, Anchiceratops, Arrhinoceratops, and Pachyrhinosaurus, pachycephalosaurid Stegoceras, ostrich-mimics Ornithomimus and Struthiomimus, {{a variety of}} poorly known small theropods {{including}} troodontids and dromaeosaurids, and the tyrannosaurs Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus. The dinosaurs from this formation are sometimes known as Edmontonian, after a land mammal age, and are distinct {{from those in the}} formations above and below. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is interpreted as having a significant marine influence, due to an encroaching Western Interior Seaway, the shallow <b>sea</b> <b>that</b> covered the midsection of North America through much of the Cretaceous. H. altispinus may have preferred to stay more landward.|$|E

5|$|Only {{two ships}} {{of the ten}} were completed: Cöln and Dresden. Five other ships were launched, but not completed—these ships {{received}} names—and the remaining three had only had some work done to their keels before work ceased. These latter three ships were known only by their contract names. Cöln and Dresden had very limited careers, since they were completed so late in the war. They both participated in a fleet sortie into the northern North <b>Sea</b> <b>that</b> attempted to intercept a heavily-escorted convoy from Britain to Norway. And they {{were assigned to the}} abortive final sortie in October 1918. Both cruisers were interned in Scapa Flow and scuttled there in June 1921, and both remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|Patroclus was {{a leading}} {{official}} and admiral under Ptolemy II, {{best known for his}} activity during the Chremonidean War (267–261 BC). His early career is obscure, but it must have been distinguished enough for him to rise to the chief priesthood of Alexander and the Theoi Adelphoi in 271/270 BC. After the outbreak of the Chremonidean War, he led a diplomatic and military expedition to the Aegean <b>Sea</b> <b>that</b> expanded Ptolemaic control by establishing bases at Crete, Ceos, Thera, Attica and the Argolid. From these bases he tried, without much success, to aid the Athenians against Antigonus II Gonatas, King of Macedon. He may have been the defeated Ptolemaic commander at the Battle of Cos, which marked the end of Ptolemaic thalassocracy.|$|E
5|$|The Allegheny Plateau {{formed in}} the Alleghenian orogeny some 300million years ago, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa {{collided}} with the landmass that became North America, forming Pangaea. In the dissected plateau, years of erosion have cut away the soft rocks, forming the valleys, and leaving the hardest rocks relatively untouched. The land on which Quehanna Wild Area sits {{was part of the}} coastline of a shallow <b>sea</b> <b>that</b> covered a great portion of what is now North America in the Pennsylvanian subperiod. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today.|$|E

In the Pacific, they encountered a strange boundary between two currents of very different temperatures, containing a vast diversity of life on the border between the two. He sailed along the border between the currents for several days to document it, theorizing that it could be the cause of the unusual climate which South America had recently been experiencing. Beebe's study of these currents, and their effect on the climate of South America, is the earliest known study of the phenomenon known as El Niño.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Öland was {{the first}} of several major Swedish defeats at <b>sea</b> <b>that</b> ended in {{complete}} Danish dominance over the southern Baltic {{for the duration of the}} Scanian War. That the main naval base in Stockholm was locked in ice during the winter of 1675–76 showed the necessity of an ice-free harbor that was closer to Danish home waters. In 1679, King Charles personally chose the site for a new base at what would later become Karlskrona. The lessons from the war also led to improvements in Swedish naval organization under the guidance of Hans Wachtmeister (1641–1714) which included better funding and maintenance, increased readiness for mobilization in the southern Baltic and permanent recruitment of skilled personnel through the allotment system.|$|E

The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel.

Shortly after noon on 3 September, U-66 reported a position in the North <b>Sea</b> <b>that</b> placed her beyond known British minefields, in what was her last known contact. A postwar German study offered no explanation for U-66s loss. British records suggest that U-66 may have either struck a mine in an older minefield in the Dogger Bank area, or that a combination of destroyers, submarines, and anti-submarine net tenders sank U-66 sometime between 1 and 11 October. Author Dwight Messimer discounts this latter theory as not being supported by operational details.|$|E
