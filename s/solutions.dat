If the <b>solutions</b> are required to be positive integers (x>0,y>0), only {{a finite number of}} <b>solutions</b> may be possible. This restriction on the acceptable <b>solutions</b> allows some systems of Diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have a finite number of solutions; this is impossible for a system of linear equations when the <b>solutions</b> can be any real number (see Underdetermined system).|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{distinct}} <b>solutions</b> {{can also be}} identified with Burnside's Lemma. For a solution, the set of equivalent <b>solutions</b> which can be reached using these operations (excluding relabeling), form an orbit of the symmetric group. The number of essentially different <b>solutions</b> is then the number of orbits, which can be computed using Burnside's lemma. The Burnside fixed points are <b>solutions</b> that differ only by relabeling. Using this technique, Jarvis/Russell computed the number of essentially different (symmetrically distinct) <b>solutions</b> as 5,472,730,538.|$|E

5|$|An ancient {{solution}} to a flow problem is a curve whose evolution can be extrapolated backwards for all time, without singularities. All of the self-similar <b>solutions</b> that shrink or stay the same size rather than growing are ancient <b>solutions</b> in this sense; they can be extrapolated backwards by reversing the self-similarity transformation that they would undergo by the forwards curve-shortening flow. Thus, for instance, the circle, grim reaper, and Abresch–Langer curves are all ancient <b>solutions.</b>|$|E

5|$|Insoluble ionic {{compounds}} can be {{precipitated by}} mixing two <b>solutions,</b> {{one with the}} cation and one with the anion in it. Because all <b>solutions</b> are electrically neutral, the two <b>solutions</b> mixed must also contain counterions of the opposite charges. To ensure that these do not contaminate the precipitated ionic compound, {{it is important to}} ensure they do not also precipitate. If the two <b>solutions</b> have hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions as the counterions, they will react with one another in what is called an acid–base reaction or a neutralization reaction to form water. Alternately the counterions can be chosen to ensure that even when combined into a single solution they will remain soluble as spectator ions.|$|E

Tetravalent americium forms stable solid compounds (dioxide, fluoride and hydroxide) as well as complexes in aqueous <b>solutions.</b> It was reported that in alkaline solution americium can be oxidized to the heptavalent state, but these data proved erroneous.

5|$|The set of all <b>solutions</b> to a 2-satisfiability {{instance}} has {{the structure}} of a median graph, in which an edge corresponds to the operation of flipping the values of a set of variables that are all constrained to be equal or unequal to each other.

Conversely, any median graph can be represented as the set of <b>solutions</b> to a 2-satisfiability instance in this way. The median of any three <b>solutions</b> is formed by setting each variable to the value it holds in the majority of the three <b>solutions.</b> This median always forms another solution to the instance.|$|E
