40|$|Ioffe-Pritchard trap. In {{the latter}} we have {{achieved}} the trapping parameters required in the experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates with much reduced power consumption. In a second time we have replaced the free standing wires with an atom chip, which we have used to compress the atomic cloud in potentials with trap frequencies above 100 kHz and ground state sizes below 100 nm. Such potentials are especially interesting for quantum information proposals of performing quantum gate operations with controlled collisions between trapped atoms. Finally, by combining two wire guides we have experimentally realized an innovative kind of beam splitter for guided atoms. We have investigated the splitting potential generated by a Y-shaped wire which has one input, i. e. the central arm of the Y, and two outputs corresponding {{to the left and}} right arms of the Y. By tuning the current ratio in the two outputs we have observed atoms switching from left to right as well as symmetric splitting. This and other similar designs are suitable for integration in more complex atomic circuits, i. e. atom interferometers, designed on the atom chip surface. Atom chips will open the way to a new generation of 'surface-mounted' experiments where many atom optical elements are assembled in a single circuit. Such a robust and easy to use device can find widespread applications from clocks and acceleration sensors to implementations of quantum information processing and communication. This thesis reports on the experimental demonstration of magnetic guides, traps and beam splitters for neutral atoms using current carrying wires. A straight wire allows to create two basic guide configurations: the magnetic field generated by the wire alone produces a guide where atoms in a strong field seeking state perform orbits around the wire (Kepler guide); by adding an external magnetic field, atoms in a weak field seeking state are guided at the location where the external field and the field generated by the wire cancel out (<b>side</b> <b>guide).</b> Furthermore, bending the wire in various shapes allows to modify the <b>side</b> <b>guide</b> potential and hence to create a large variety of three dimensional traps. A relevant property of these potentials is that higher trapping gradients are obtained by decreasing the current flowing in the wires. As the trap is compressed, it also moves closer to the wire. This feature has allowed us to create microscopic potentials by using thin wires designed on a surface (atom chip) by means of high resolution microfabrication techniques. Wires mounted on a surface have the advantage of being more robust and able to sustain larger currents due to their thermal coupling with the substrate. In our experiment we have developed methods to load these traps and guides with laser cooled atoms. Our first investigations have been performed with free standing wires which we have used to study the Kepler guide, the <b>side</b> <b>guide</b> and a three dimensiona...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the lifetime of}} magnetically trapped atoms above a planar, layered atom chip structure. Numerical calculations of the thermal magnetic noise spectrum are performed, based on the exact magnetic Green function and multi layer reflection coefficients. We have performed lifetime measurements where the centre of a <b>side</b> <b>guide</b> trap is laterally shifted {{with respect to the}} current carrying wire using additional bias fields. Comparing the experiment to theory, we find a fair agreement and demonstrate that for a chip whose topmost layer is metallic, the magnetic noise depends essentially on the thickness of that layer, as long as the layers below have a, much smaller conductivity; essentially the same magnetic noise would be obtained with a metallic membrane suspended in vacuum. Based on our theory we give general scaling laws of how to reduce the effect of surface magnetic noise on the trapped atoms...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the {{hot rolling}} process, the steel slab may {{experience}} a temperature gradient along its transverse direction which may cause camber and wedge after rolling. Camber and wedge phenomenon {{will affect the}} quality of the steel plate. To eliminate camber and wedge phenomenon, a pair of side guides is placed before and behind the hot rolling mill. The position mode and the force mode are the control modes for side guides to correct the slab shape and to guide the slab to follow rolling direction. Finite element analysis using ABAQUS was applied to simulate hot rolling process to find the correction mechanism of rolling equipment. The centerline of slab was traced and the shape of slab was predicted. The difference of rolling load between work side and drive side of roller was determined. Furthermore, the load, stress and velocity distribution on the slab at roll bite were analyzed. By using numerical model, hot rolling parameters including <b>side</b> <b>guide</b> control strategy can be predicted, which can provide the hot rolling line as a guideline {{to improve the quality of}} the steel slab...|$|E

The accuracy of the models was verified by comparing the simulation results with the point-cloud model of the actual produced rim in terms of exterior shape and thickness. Distributions {{and changes in the}} equivalent stress and equivalent plastic strain were analysed. The results indicate that the rim misalignment defect often occurs when the unequal width of the reserved material at the two ends of the rim is in the first rolling process. An improved die design is proposed.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{bidirectional}} power {{performance of a}} tidal unit, two designs were investigated. The use of unilateral or double guide vanes in a tubular tidal unit influences {{the performance of the}} hydraulic unit. Based on the N-S equations and the RNG k-ε turbulence model, the SIMPLEC algorithm was used for 3 D steady-state numerical simulation of the entire turbine flow passage with unilateral and double guide vanes. The internal flow condition under positive and reverse power generation conditions was also analyzed. At the same time, the turbine, with a runner 1. 6 m in diameter, was scaled down to 0. 35 m diameter for model tests. The model tests were based on a multifunction hydromechanical test bench at Hohai University. The water head, discharge, and torque of the tubular turbine were, respectively, tested using a pressure difference sensor, electromagnetic flow meter, and torque meter under different guide-vane openings. The results show that turbine efficiency in the model test is slightly lower than that predicted by numerical simulation under the same conditions. However, the difference is not large.
