40|$|International audienceThe massive {{integration}} of <b>sustainable</b> <b>energies</b> into electrical grids (non-interconnectedor connected) {{is a major}} problem due to their stochastic character revealed by strongfluctuations at all scales. In this paper, the scaling behaviour or power law correlationsand the nature of scaling behaviour of sustainable resource data such as flow velocity,atmospheric wind speed, solar global solar radiation and sustainable energy such as,wind power output, are highlighted. For the first time, Fourier power spectral densitiesare estimated for each dataset. We show that the power spectrum densities obtained areclose to the 5 / 3 Kolmogorov spectrum. Furthermore, the multifractal and intermittentproperties of sustainable resource and energy data have been revealed by the concavityof the scaling exponent function.
