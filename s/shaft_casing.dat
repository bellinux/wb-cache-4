Depending on the <b>shaft</b> <b>casing</b> requirement, installation of the requisite steel pipes could take up to 96 hours. After that, a large concrete platform for the winching rig to raise and lower the capsule had to be poured while the winching rig required assembly. Finally, thorough testing of the capsule and winching system together was required.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect on side shear resistance in limestone when temporary casing is used. Due to testing in actual limestone being an unrealistic goal, simulated limestone mixes were prepared and cast into 6 – 42 in. diameter beds. Limestone throughout Florida can be quite varied (e. g. 50 - 5000 psi) but where stronger limestone is not likely to be penetrated by casing installation. Therefore, target unconfined compressive strengths of the study specimens ranged between 60 psi to 850 psi. A simulated limestone material was developed based on over 200 cylinders cast for unconfined compression testing where the binder (cement or lime), water to binder ratio, aggregate types (sand, coquina, and oyster shells), and binder content were all varied. Results of the laboratory tests were used to establish simulated limestone mixes for 42 in. diameter specimen beds in which 1 / 10 th scale drilled shaft rock sockets were cast. Drilled <b>shaft</b> <b>casing</b> installation techniques were adapted to 1 / 10 th scale where driven casing and oscillated/rotated casing methods were simulated. Within each of the simulated limestone test beds, 5 shaft specimens were cast with and without temporary casing where at least one of the specimens was cast without temporary casing (control specimen). Pullout tests of each specimen revealed that the presence of temporary casing reduced the side shear by 25 to 28 percent depending on the casing installation/extraction method. However, in all cases representative of weaker limestone, the measured reduction did not affect the anticipated design side shear resistance...|$|E
40|$|A {{representative}} {{model of}} aero-engine test rig has been built, comprising the following basic components: rotor, <b>shaft,</b> <b>casing,</b> flexible support structure and bearing housings. One of the bearing housings is designed {{in such a}} way that the stiffness along one radial direction is adjustable, and can be set between linear and strongly nonlinear. In the latter case, it has the characteristic of snap-through springs, which is somewhat analogous to some magnetic bearing configurations. The adjustability of the bearing support stiffness makes it possible to study the dynamic properties of an engine rig with different boundary conditions. A notable aspect of this test rig is that all the major flexibilities in an operating aero-engine have been included, e. g. flexible support structure, casing etc. In the field of structural dynamics, mathematical models are widely used, especially at the design stage of a product when the effect of physical modifications on the total dynamic response of the structure is required before the real fabrication is carried out. In addition, highly accurate and efficient structural mathematical models are required for the emerging SMART machine concept, in which real-time machine diagnosis and prognosis methods demand fast and accurate decision-making based on the results of data processed using those models. The problem we are facing now is that, as the structure becomes more complicated, and consists of more segments and joints, many of which can be strongly nonlinear, the accuracy and efficiency of the mathematical model deteriorates rapidly due to the difficulties in modelling the joints and the nonlinearities existing in those joints. In this paper, a Frequency Response Function (FRF) coupling scheme, together with the Multi-Harmonic Balance Method (MHBM), is used to model the assembled test rig. The basic FRF coupling method has been well documented and its accuracy and efficiency in linear structure assemblies has been recognised in many papers and books. MHBM is widely used to solve nonlinear problems in the frequency domain. The advantage of this combined methodology is shown in the comparison between test and simulation result...|$|E

40|$|International audienceReducing the {{clearances}} between rotating {{and fixed}} parts {{is an important}} factor in increasing the performances of turbomachines. The physical counterpart however is an evolution in possible rotor-stator contacts capable of causing unstable dynamic behavior. A proper prediction of the rotor-stator contact occurrences and associated induced phenomena, has therefore become of a great interest for aero-engine mechanical engineers. Most numerical simulations involving rotor-stator contact can be divided into two types of physical behavior. The first focuses on contact induced blade/casing interactions, in only taking into account the blades and casing flexibility. The second type of behavior takes into account the shaft dynamic while neglecting blade flexibility. Future designs of aircraft engines will however raise the need to combine these two types of models. Since, the structural components are more flexible, the dynamic coupling between engine modules is increased. This paper proposes a study based on a structure representative of the whole aircraft engine, including the contacts that may arise between the fan-blade tips and fan casing. We have introduced a fully-coupled phenomenological model with flexible blades, <b>shaft</b> and <b>casing.</b> Furthermore, this model includes an elastic link between <b>shaft</b> and <b>casing</b> to simulate the fan frame behavior. We begin by explaining the linear results, which highlight the dynamic couplings between these various model components. During a second step, this paper presents the nonlinear results obtained by introducing a contact law. These results demonstrate the influence of the whole engine dynamic on contact-related behavior with special focus on the system dynamic stability...|$|R

The novelty of the present research is that an advanced method is proposed to locate fictitious interior observers inside the scattering surface, contributing to that the incident acoustic pressure received by the fictitious interior observers can be efficiently computed. Numerical cases show that the developed method ensures high computational accuracy and significantly improves the computational efficiency compared with existing methods, showing an appealing application potential in efficiently predicting rotor noise scattered by the <b>shaft</b> and <b>casing.</b> Parametric studies are carried out to investigate {{the effects of the}} hub–tip ratio and the rotating frequency on a rotor noise scattered by a hub...|$|R
40|$|In {{nuclear power}} plants the primary-loop {{recirculation}} (PLR) pump circulates the high temperature/high-pressure coolant in order to remove the thermal energy generated within the reactor. The pump is sealed using the cold purge flow in the shaft seal gap between the rotating <b>shaft</b> and stationary <b>casing,</b> where different forms of Taylor–Couette flow instabilities develop. Due to the temperature difference between the hot recirculating water and the cold purge water (of order of 200 °C), the flow instabilities in the gap cause temperature fluctuations, {{which can lead to}} <b>shaft</b> or <b>casing</b> thermal fatigue cracks. The present work numerically investigated the influence of temperature difference and rotating speed on the structure and dynamics of the Taylor–Couette flow instabilities. The CFD solver used in this study was extensively validated against the experimental data published in the open literature. Influence of temperature difference on the fluid dynamics of Taylor vortices was investigated in this study. With large temperature difference, the structure of the Taylor vortices is greatly stretched at the interface region between the annulus gap and the lower recirculating cavity. Higher temperature difference and rotating speed induce lower fluctuating frequency and smaller circumferential wave number of Taylor vortices. However, the azimuthal wave speed remains unchanged with all the cases tested. The predicted axial location of the maximum temperature fluctuation on the shaft is in a good agreement with the experimental data, identifying the region potentially affected by the thermal fatigue. The physical understandings of such flow instabilities presented in this paper would be useful for future PLR pump design optimization...|$|R

This growth does not usually present difficulties during operation. However, this paper discusses four recent turbomachinery trains that experienced radial subsynchronous vibration resulting from axial misalignment. In each example, the train included a gearbox with a double-helical gearset that presented a lateral vibration response at system torsional critical frequencies while operating at low load. Thermal growth resulted in axial misalignment {{that produced a}} ?zero-backlash? condition when one helix contacted {{on the back side}} of the teeth. Data collected with an axial displacement probe verified the appearance of lateral subsynchronous vibration was associated with excessive axial misalignment of the gearset. Data are presented from these experiences, including a discussion of other vibration phenomena that could be mistaken for this behavior. Finally, design and analysis recommendations are provided for preventing such occurrences...|$|R

A 3 D-CFD steady state flow simulation has been performed using ANSYS CFX codes.

Absolute flow velocity angles are obtained at runner entrance for simulations with and without the runner.

40|$|To {{predict the}} {{vibration}} in rotating mechanical equipment, {{the role of}} bearings as a dynamic coupler between the <b>shaft</b> and <b>casing</b> must be completely understood. In 1990, Lim and Singh have presented a bearing stiffness model with three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom, to replace previous models, which, in general, neglect flexural or out-of-plane type vibrations. This model is characterized graphically {{in order to enhance}} the understanding of the influence of the contact angle and preloads. Earlier attempts to measure all stiffnesses of a bearing for comparison with the model partly failed, because the experimental setup had some special shortcomings. The use of more complex identification methods could not overcome the problems. A modified experimental setup is presented, which is capable of yielding reproducible measurements. Estimating a complete stiffness matrix directly from the measured transfer matrix appeared to be unfeasible. Therefore, single-degree-of-freedom fits on the measurements are compared with fits on the model. However, the so-called coupling terms cannot be compared using SDOF fit procedures. Nevertheless, these results appear to be very promising and applicable in practice, but future research is needed to investigat...|$|R

40|$|Lateral {{vibration}} of rotors can {{be significantly}} reduced by inserting the damping elements between the <b>shaft</b> and the <b>casing.</b> The theoretical analysis, confirmed by computational simulations, shows that {{to achieve the}} optimum compromise between attenuation of the oscillation amplitude and magnitude of the forces transmitted through the coupling elements between the rotor and the stationary part, the damping effect must be controllable. For this purpose, the squeeze film dampers lubricated by magnetorheological fluid can be applied. The damping effect {{is controlled by the}} change of intensity of the magnetic field in the lubricating film. This article presents a procedure developed for investigation of the steady state response of rigid rotors coupled with the casing by flexible elements and short magnetorheological dampers. Their lateral vibration is governed by nonlinear (due to the damping forces) equations of motion. The steady state solution is obtained by application of a collocation method, which arrives at solving a set of nonlinear algebraic equations. The pressure distribution in the oil film is described by a Reynolds equation modified for the case of short dampers and Bingham fluid. Components of the damping force are calculated by integration of the pressure distribution around the circumference and {{along the length of the}} damper. The developed procedure makes possible to determine the steady state response of rotors excited by their unbalance, to determine magnitude of the forces transmitted through the coupling elements in the supports into the stationary part and is intended for proposing the control of the damping effect to achieve optimum performance of the dampers...|$|R
