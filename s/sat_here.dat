5|$|The Town Hall {{was built}} in 1778, with the porch and arcade being added in 1861 and the balcony and round windows in 1932. It is a Grade II listed building. It {{replaced}} the former {{on the site of}} the Market and Assize Hall in the Market Place, and a Canonical House also known as 'The Exchequer', on the authority of an Act of Parliament dated 1779. The building also houses the magistrates courts and other offices. The Assize court last <b>sat</b> <b>here</b> in October 1970.|$|E

I {{would have}} <b>sat</b> <b>here</b> {{until the end}} of my {{sentence}} because I don't need mercy from Putin," [...] Maria Alyokhina told The New York Times after her release. [...] "I think this is an attempt to improve the image of the current government, a little, before the Sochi Olympics — particularly for the Western Europeans. But I don't consider this humane or merciful. This is a lie." [...] Tolokonnikova also said, [...] "Whether one likes it or not, going to the Olympics in Russia is an acceptance of the internal political situation in Russia, an acceptance of the course taken by a person who is interested in the Olympics above all else — Vladimir Putin." ...|$|E
500|$|What {{became known}} as the [...] "Norway debate" [...] opened on 7 May, and lasted for two days. The initial speeches, {{including}} Chamberlain's, were nondescript, but Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes, member for Portsmouth North, in full uniform, delivered a withering attack on the conduct of the Norway campaign, though he excluded Churchill from criticism. Leo Amery then delivered a speech which he concluded by echoing Oliver Cromwell's words on dissolving the Long Parliament: [...] "You have <b>sat</b> <b>here</b> too long for any good you are doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!" [...] When Labour announced that they would call for a division of the House of Commons, Chamberlain called upon his [...] "friends—and I still have some friends in this House—to support the Government tonight". Though {{the use of the word}} [...] "friends" [...] was a conventional term to refer to party colleagues, and, according to biographer Robert Self, many MPs took it that way, it was an [...] "error of judgment" [...] for Chamberlain to refer to party loyalty [...] "when the gravity of the war situation required national unity". Lloyd George joined the attackers and Churchill concluded the debate with a vigorous speech in support of the government. When the division took place, the government, which had a normal majority of over 200, prevailed by only 81, with 38MPs in receipt of the government whip voting against it, with between 20 and 25 abstaining.|$|E

They came up and <b>sat</b> <b>’ere</b> where we’re sitting now, all dazed-like. It wasn’t only the chance o’ losing the prize that upset ’em, but they’d wasted their time and ruined their gardens and got called mad by the other folks. Henery Walker’s state o’ mind was dreadful for to see, and he kep’ thinking of ’orrible things to say to George English, and then being afraid they wasn’t strong enough.|$|R

2500|$|Despite {{continued}} {{attempts at}} maintaining the theatre, it declined {{over the next}} 3 decades. By the 1940s, the performers had to beware of holes in the stage, unsafe wiring, faulty heating, and cockroaches. Unsafe conditions eventually led to a planned demolition. In 1948, Sir Laurence Olivier arrived in Hobart {{as part of the}} Old Vic touring company and spoke passionately about the theatre, launching a national appeal; [...] "We appreciate playing in it not only because it is a beautiful little theatre; it is more than that. Your parents and grandparents have <b>sat</b> <b>here</b> as audience. Our parents have acted on this stage. In the one hundred and eleven years it has been played in it has built up atmosphere and the secret of atmosphere is antiquity. Don’t let it go." ...|$|E

60|$|Maj.: Emily dearest, I {{had already}} begun making advances, even before you <b>sat</b> down <b>here.</b> I also bribed the steward to put our seats {{together}} in a secluded corner. “You may consider it done, sir,” was his reply. That was immediately after breakfast.|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{will seem}} nothing to you. Such whims are only {{impressive}} as we originate them, I think; {{they are not}} to be communicated.

"I had <b>sat</b> down <b>here</b> to die," [...] quoth the palmer; [...] "but {{for many}} years I have carried in my wallet these {{precious}} things which you see set forth now before me.
