In a combination of shock and disbelief, Charles returns to The Swamp to listen to the Mozart record, but removes the record and smashes it in anger. Later still on the final night that everyone at the M*A*S*H is together, Charles says that before the war, music was a stress reliever to him, but because of the Chinese musicians and their fate, music will forever be a reminder of the horrors of war.|$|E

40|$|Computer {{assisted}} surgery has rapidly {{developed over}} the last decade, essentially due {{to the development of}} navigation and 3 D virtual surgical planning and image fusion technologies. The recent introduction of intra-operative cone-beam CT scan (CBCT), which integrates flat panel technology, allows for high resolution bone imaging, the quality and accuracy of which is similar to the one obtained by conventional spiral CT scan. The combination of these two technologies in a "hybrid" operating unit enables the convergence of the pre-, intra- and post-operative steps in a linear computer-assisted processing chain, which optimises surgery accuracy, predictability and patient outcomes while potentially reducing costs, operating times and need for further surgical revision. TECHNICAL NOTE: The "hybrid" unit includes: 1) the operating room (65 m(2)) equipped with horizontal laminar-flow, a mobile monoplane ceiling suspended C-arm CBCT scan system with a flat panel detector, a wireless navigation system, and an interactive wall-mount touch screen 2) the control room (18 m(2)) separated from the operating room by an X-ray lead protective glass window, including two separate computer workstations for 3 D image integration and processing 3) the <b>scrub</b> <b>room</b> (17 m(2)) with two separate stainless steel surgical wash-basins. The intra-operative protocol includes the following steps: 1) elaboration of the patient specific pre-operative computed planning and simulation based on pre-operatively and/or intra-operatively acquired patient images 2) intra-operative navigational guidance setting 3) surgical procedure 4) intra-operative 3 D CT imaging 5) suture...|$|E

'I do feel {{sometimes}} that the living alone has its temptations, and those great ones; I mean that I can arrange everything--my work, my hours, my whole life--after my own pleasure {{a great deal}} more than probably is good for me; and it is very easy to become, in a manner, very self-indulgent. I think that most likely, as our work (D.V.) progresses, one or two men may be living with me, and that will supply a check upon me of some kind. At present I am too much without it. Here I am in my cosy little room, after my delicious breakfast of perfect coffee, made in Jem's contrivance, hot milk and plenty of it, dry toast and potato. Missionary hardships! On the grass between me and the beach--a distance of some seventy yards--lie the boys' canvas beds and blankets and rugs, having a good airing. The schooner lies at anchor beyond; and, three or four miles beyond the schooner, lies Eangitoto, the great natural breakwater to the harbour. With my Dollond's opera-glass that you gave me, I can see the master and mate at their work refitting. Everything is under my eye. Our long boat and whale boat (so-called from their shapes) lie on the beach, covered with old sails to protect them from the sun.

60|$|Now, while I'm freeing my mind, I {{should like}} to enter my protest against {{employing}} convalescents as attendants, instead of strong, properly trained, and cheerful men. How {{it may be in}} other places I cannot say; but here it was a source of constant trouble and confusion, these feeble, ignorant men trying to sweep, scrub, lift, and wait upon their sicker comrades. One, with a diseased heart, was expected to run up and down stairs, carry heavy trays, and move helpless men; he tried it, and grew rapidly worse than when he first came: and, when he was ordered out to march away to the convalescent hospital, fell, in a sort of fit, before he turned the corner, and was brought back to die. Another, hurt by a fall from his horse, endeavored to do his duty, but failed entirely, and the wrath of the ward master fell upon the nurse, who must either <b>scrub</b> the <b>rooms</b> herself, or take the lecture; for the boy looked stout and well, and the master never happened to see him turn white with pain, or hear him groan in his sleep when an involuntary motion strained his poor back. Constant complaints were being made of incompetent attendants, and some dozen women did double duty, and then were blamed for breaking down. If any hospital director fancies this a good and economical arrangement, allow one used up nurse to tell him it isn't, and beg him to spare the sisterhood, who sometimes, in their sympathy, forget that they are mortal, and run the risk of being made immortal, sooner than is agreeable to their partial friends.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} sustainable process for simultaneous removal of waste gases such as NO, NO 2, and SO 2 by an electrochemically generated Ag(I) /Ag(II) redox mediator system. High removal efficiency was achieved for NO and SO 2 by the wet <b>scrubbing</b> method at <b>room</b> temperature and atmospheric pressure. This removal is achieved through oxidation and absorption by contacting the gaseous stream with redox mediator ions that offer specific or selective solubility for the solute gases to be recovered in a wet scrubber. The process parameters such as gas velocity, liquid velocity, Ag(I) concentration, and HNO 3 concentration were investigated to explore the possibility of complete removal of waste gases. The Ag(I) /Ag(II) -based mediated electrochemical oxidation process proved to be quite effective for simultaneous removal of NO, NOx, and SO 2 from the simulated flue gas mixtures containing NO and SO 2 over a wide concentration range of 100 - 400 ppm. Studies were carried out with individual gas components for the mixture, and the effect of input NO and input SO 2 concentrations on the NOx and SO 2 removal efficiencies at 20 °C was examined.

40|$|Introduction: The role of scrub in the {{prevention}} of post-surgery infections is well-known. This study aimed to investigate the inputs and process of surgical <b>scrub</b> in operating <b>rooms</b> of the largest heart hospital of northwest Iran. Methods: This study took place with a before-after design as a clinical audit in 2014. A check list developed based on national and international standards of surgical hand scrub was used as the study instrument. Checklists were completed by observation of surgical team scrubbing in real situation. Descriptive statistics and graphs were used to describe the results. Results: A compliance degree with the standards for prerequisites, equipment, general items, process and time of scrub was observed as 58 %, 55 %, 33 %, 68 % and 22 %, respectively. The compliance degree after the intervention was 72 %, 66 %, 66 %, 85 % and 61 %, respectively. Improvement was observed in all studied aspects of scrub. The total score of compliance with the standards changed from 47 % to 70 %. The main issues were incorrect order of scrubbing the areas of the hands, incorrect way of scrubbing the arms, insufficient scrubbing the arms (not above elbow), and lack of awareness about hospital’s policy on scrub time. Conclusion: The results showed defects in the surgical scrub of the studied hospital and that the compliance with the standards can be improved by simple interventions. Periodical audit and observation of the scrub and then feedback is recommended...|$|R

Our aim is to keep them till they shall have been sufficiently qualified for situations, and especially, also, till they are strong enough to go out, as far as we are able to judge. We uniformly prefer fitting the girls for service, instead of apprenticing them to businesses, as being generally far better for their bodies and their souls. Only in a few instances have female Orphans been apprenticed to a business, when their health would not allow them to go to service. If the girls give us satisfaction, while under our care, so that we can recommend them to a situation, they are fitted-out {{at the expense of the}} Institution. The girls generally remain under our care till they are 17 years old. They rarely leave sooner; and, as we receive children from their earliest days, we have often had girls 13, 14, and even 17 years under our care. They are instructed in reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, geography, English history, a little of universal history, all kinds of useful needlework, and household work. They make their clothes and keep them in repair; they work in the kitchens, sculleries, wash-houses, and laundries; and, in a word, we aim at this, that, if any of them do not turn out well, temporally or spiritually, and do not become useful members of society, it shall not at least be our fault. The boys are, generally, apprenticed when they are between 14 and 15 years old; but in each case we consider the welfare of the individual Orphan, without having any fixed rule respecting these matters. The boys have a free choice of the trade or business they like to learn; but, having once chosen, and having been apprenticed, we do not allow them to alter. The boys, as well as the girls, have an outfit provided for them, and any other expenses, that may be connected with their apprenticeship, are also met by the funds of the Orphan Establishment. As it may be interesting to the reader to know the kind of trades or businesses to which we generally apprentice the boys, I state that, during the last fifty years, all the boys who were apprenticed, were bound to carpenters, or carpenters and joiners, cabinet makers, basket makers, boot and shoe makers, tailors and drapers, plumbers, painters and glaziers, linen drapers, printers, bakers, grocers, hair-dressers, iron-mongers, tin-plate workers, confectioners, hosiers, builders, millers, gas-fitters, smiths, out-fitters, provision dealers, sailmakers, upholsterers, wholesale grocers, chemists, seed merchants, umbrella makers, electro-plate manufacturers, or machine makers. Some have been sent out to become post-office or telegraph clerks. A few also became clerks in offices. The boys have the same kind of mental cultivation as the girls, and learn to knit their stockings. They also make their beds, clean their shoes, <b>scrub</b> their <b>rooms,</b> go on errands and work in the garden around the Orphan Establishment, in the way of digging, planting, weeding &c." ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Many of {{hospital}} acquired infections that cause so much {{morbidity and mortality}} and have great economical burden are transmitted via contaminated hands of health care workers (HCW). Prevalence of these infections can decrease up to 30 % with hygienic measures. In this study we assessed the prevalence of careers and microbial spectrum of HCW,s hand and relation between detergent used for washing and reduction of microbial load of HCW, s hand. Materials and Methods: This study was done in two part: Descriptive part (cross sectional) and analytical part (before –after). Cases were Consist of all staff Working in wards of center of pediatrics hospital (Including attends, residents, interns, nurses and workers). In first part,we assess hand microbial spectrum and contamination load of 72 staff and in second part, we assessed and compared hand microbial spectrum and load before and after of washing with four detergent : plain soap (60 staff), liquid soap (60 staff), betadin scrub in ward (60 staff) and betadin <b>scrub</b> in operating <b>room</b> manner (26 staff). Results: % 87. 5 of personnel had positive cultures-. The most prevalent bacteria were staph. epidermidis (% 79. 4), staph. oreus (% 42. 9), klebsiella (% 12. 7), E-coli (% 12. 7). The rate of reduction or negative cultures in groups used betadin were greater than the first two group (P-value < 0 / 05). Thirty staff (10 with plain soap, 10 with liquid soap and 10 with operating <b>room</b> betadin <b>scrub)</b> dried their hands after washing. Forty percent of first, fifty percent of second and ninety percent of third group have negative culture after drying. Also 11 samples were drawn from faucets {{that all of them}} were positive. Conclusion: Prevalence of careers is high among HCWS and drying of hands can an important role in hospital infection rate. Faucets have heavy contamination and can transmit bacteria to hands after washing. For theses reasons education and of staff to correct hand washing and drying before every contact with patients and used of faucets without direct hand touching can play a great role in lowering hospital infections...|$|R
40|$|Background: Nowadays, {{new methods}} such as scrub with an {{efficient}} agent for short time are used {{for the prevention of}} communicable diseases and infection control at the most of operating rooms. But, at most of our operating rooms, surgical teams use traditional and routine hand scrub (with Betadine more than 3 min). The aim of this clinical trial was to compare efficacy of Betadine and an alcoholic agent (Decosept) on BCC in Social Security hospital of Khorramabad (west of Iran) in may 2006. Materials and methods: twenty cases were selected from operating <b>room</b> <b>scrub</b> nurses according to inclusion criteria. First, all people washed their hands for 1 minutes with soap. The bacterial colony count was assessed by rubbing their fingertips in Triptyc Soy Broth (TSB) for 1 min. at the next step each person scrubbed their hands with Betadine (Povidone Iodine 7. 5 %) for 3 min and dried them by sterile towel after rinse. Bacterial colony count (immediate effect) was assessed for one hand and the other hand was gloved for 2 hours. After the gloves were taken off, a second colony count was assessed for sustained effect. After one week, all subjects washed their hand and the bacterial colony count was assessed. Then, the hands of each subject scrubbed with Decosept in such a manner that their hands remained wet for 3 min (10 - 12 ml). Data was analyzed by the paired T test. Results: Comparison of BCC Frequency was different for immediate effect of Betadine and Decosept (38 vs. 25), and also for 2 h after scrub (72 vs. 40). The mean of BCC reduction immediately after Betadine and Decosept scrub was significantly different (PV= 0. 011). Also, the mean of BCC increase (sustained effect) 2 h after scrub was different (PV = 0. 023). The BCC mean was increased (1. 7) immediately and 2 hours after scrub with Betadine. But, this increase after scrub with Decosept (second stage) was less than Betadine (1. 15). So, the difference between the first and the second stages, was significant (PV = 0. 001) Conclusion: In general, alcoholic agent (Decosept) was more efficient to reduce BCC. We suggest the alcoholic agent be used more frequently for surgical hand scrub...|$|R
