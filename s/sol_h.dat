Among the subjects, 11 had a stable TA H reflex whose facilitation was {{compared to that of}} <b>Sol</b> <b>H.</b> Effects of selective isometric voluntary contraction of either Sol or TA were assessed both on EMG responses and H reflex facilitation. At rest, only 36 % of subjects exhibited a response in Sol at a mean latency of 123 msec and 39 % in TA at a latency of 119 msec. Responses were seen in antagonist muscles in 74 % of subjects. Incidence in Tra was 96 %. During voluntary contraction, the results were not significantly changed either in the contracted muscle or its antagonist.

In humans, spinal use-dependent plasticity is inferred from modifications {{in the size of}} H reflex, which are often more prominent after skilled motor training.

Here we explore whether skilled training induces a change in synaptic efficacy at the synapse between Ia afferents and soleus (Sol) motoneurones. Synaptic efficacy can be modulated presynaptically through changes of the probability of transmitter release (homosynaptic depression, HD). The frequency-related depression of the <b>Sol</b> <b>H</b> reflex, thought to reflect HD, was tested at rest, before and after one single skilled (14 subjects) or non-skilled (9 subjects) cycling training session.

(1980) Eur. J. Biochem. 112, 345 - 352]. In contrast, stimuliation by carbachol induced significant phosphorylation of only protein I. This phosphorylation was low compared to isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation but corresponded to the smaller enhancement of amylase secretion. The mouse organ, however, is almost equally sensitive to beta-adrenergic and to cholinergic agonists. Incubation of mouse parotid gland slices with either 20 microM isoproterenol or 10 microM carbachol resulted in strong and comparable releases of amylase, which were accompanied by comparable phosphorylations of protein I. Proteins II and III were phosphorylated only in the presence of isoproterenol. Removal of external calcium by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) -N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate abolished the carbachol-induced release of amylase but not the phosphorylation of protein I. Isoproterenol-induced secretion of amylase and phosphorylation of proteins I, II, and III were not inhibited under these conditions. Amylase release stimulated by the ionophore A- 23187 was accompanied by the phosphorylation of protein I. Two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that the radioactive spot corresponding to protein I was located at the same position after cholinergic and after beta-adrenergic stimulation, indicating that both stimuli led to the phosphorylation of the same membrane-associated protein. These findings strongly support the view that the phosphorylation of protein I is an important step in the sequence of events leading from receptor activation to exocytosis...|$|R

The mutant markers for streptomycin and novobiocin resistance in H. parainfluenzae were shown to be unlinked. These same markers were transferred into H. influenzae in two transformation steps, and the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted. Transformation of recipient H. influenzae with DNA from the latter showed the markers to be linked, and transformation of recipient H. parainfluenzae with this DNA showed that the markers were not cotransferred. The linked streptomycin- and novobiocin-resistance mutations of H. influenzae were transformed into H. parainfluenzae in two stages, and the DNA was extracted. Transformation of recipient H. parainfluenzae with this DNA demonstrated the markers to be unlinked in H. parainfluenzae. When these markers, originally from H. influenzae and present as unlinked factors in H. parainfluenzae, are transferred back into H. influenzae, the markers showed their original linkage. The novobiocin- and erythromycin-resistance markers of H. influenzae were unlinked in H. influenzae, but were linked when transferred into H. parainfluenzae. The erythromycin-resistance marker of H. influenzae, when transferred into a novobiocin-resistant mutant of H. parainfluenzae, showed linkage with it.

The results showed that elderly adults had a longer path length for the centre of pressure and larger antero-posterior body sway across balance conditions (P < 0. 05). Muscle EMG activities were greater in elderly compared with young adults (P < 0. 05), whereas the H(max) expressed {{as a percentage of}} the H(max) was lower (P = 0. 048) in elderly (38 ± 16 %) than young adults (58 ± 16 %). The conditioned H reflex/test H reflex ratio (D 1 inhibition method) increased with eye closure and when standing on foam (P < 0. 05), with greater increases for elderly adults (P = 0. 019). These changes were accompanied by a reduced peak motor unit discharge probability when standing on rigid and foam surfaces (P 0. 001), with a greater effect for elderly adults (P = 0. 026). Based on these latter results, the increased conditioned H reflex/test H reflex ratio in similar sensory conditions is likely to reflect occlusion at the level of presynaptic inhibitory interneurones.

Changes in the mesopore size and arrangement were monitored with the aid of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and gas nitrogen adsorption/desorption at 77 K.

In the case of samples with the lowest initial theoretical molar ratio, the synthesis conditions did not affect the degree of heteroatom incorporation into the silica framework and all zirconium could be introduced under the conditions applied. The structure of materials was strongly dependent on the conditions used, and a more regular pore arrangement was obtained for longer maturation stages. The classical hydrothermal synthesis did not result in a significantly higher efficiency in the heteroatom insertion, though microwave-assisted treatment yielded materials with thicker pore walls.

40|$|Seyfert galaxies {{have been}} shown to exhibit a large variety of {{features}} in their X-ray spectra from which the environment of the central engine can be deduced. We focus on the two following aspects: the Warm Absorber, mainly responsible of the soft X-ray properties, and the reprocessing/reflecting plasma medium at the origin of the iron Kalpha fluorescent line. The physical parameters and the location of the so-called Warm Absorber (WA), a photoionized medium along the line of sight to the nuclear region, are more strongly constrained by optical coronal lines than by the oxygen edges observed in the soft X-rays and produced by the WA. The photoionization models also predict the intensities of the X-ray emission lines which are going to be detected with the new generation of X-ray satellites. An alternative model to the relativistic accretion disc is proposed to explain the profile of the X-ray iron Kalpha line observed in the Seyfert 1. This line can be formed in the framework of a quasi-spherical accretion of optically thick clouds. An optically thick photoionization code coupled with a Monte-Carlo code has been developed to compute the entire spectrum from the IR to the hard X-rays for a close geometry with a large covering factor. The multiple Compton reflections allow to reproduce the redshifted broad iron line as detected in several Seyfert 1 galaxies and in MCG- 6 - 30 - 15. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures, to appear in Proc.

40|$|Very {{high energy}} γ-rays probe the long-standing {{mystery of the}} origin of cosmic rays. Produced in the {{interactions}} of accelerated particles in astrophysical objects, they can be used to image cosmic particle accelerators. A first sensitive survey of the inner part of the Milky Way with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) reveals a population of eight previously unknown firmly detected sources of very high energy γ-rays. At least two have no known radio or x-ray counterpart and may be representative of a new class of “dark” nucleonic cosmic ray sources. F. Aharonian, A. G. Akhperjanian, K. M. Aye, A. R.

The results reveal a strong epoxide ring-opening effect of Al-alkoxides in hybrid <b>sols</b> after 24 <b>h</b> reaction time and of Zr-, Ta-, Al- and Sn-alkoxides in corresponding hybrid gels already at low concentration (1 mole%). The ring-opening rate increases in sols with higher metal alkoxide concentration (10 mole%) but decreases at 50 mole% concentration of Al-, Ti- and Zr-alkoxides. The ring-opening activity of metal alkoxides in 10 mole% hybrid sols increases after 24 h reaction time in the order Si(OEt) 4 < Ti(OEt) 4 < Zr(OBun) 4 < Ta(OEt) 5, Sn(OBut) 4, Al(OBus) 3, Al(OEtOBu) 3. The 24 <b>h</b> hybrid <b>sols</b> and gels contain considerable amounts (up to 90 %) of ethyl ether groups as reaction product of the ring-opening reaction which lowers the formation of polyether bonds. The condensation degree (c. d.) of RSi(O 0. 5) 3 units of GPTS- 1. 5 <b>H</b> 2 O <b>sols</b> with 10 mole% of metal alkoxides increases up to 80 % after 7 h reaction time in the order: Si(OEt) 4 << Sn(OBut) 4 < Zr(OBun) 4 < Al(OBus) 3 < Al(OEtOBu) 3 < Ta(OEt) 5 < Ti(OEt) 4. An additional increase in c. d. up to 90 % follows after the thermal sol-gel transformation. Generally, maximum activity of metal alkoxides in ring-opening and condensation reactions was found in sols and gels with 10 mole% additives. The effect {{of water on the}} epoxide ring-opening and on c. d. is discussed. Furthermore, the activity of metal alkoxides is compared with corresponding nanoscaled metal oxides...|$|R
40|$|Chapter One: Two of {{the most}} famous tripodal ligands, Kliui's cyclopentadienyltris(dialkylphosphito) cobaltate(III) and Trofimenko's hydrotris(1 -pyrazolyl) borate, were studied with respect to their {{reactivity}} towards Alberto's tris(solvento) tricarbonyltechnetium(I) and tris(solvento) tricarbonylrhenium(I) cations. The reaction of [M(H 2 O) 3 (CO) 3]+ (M = Tc, Re) with Na[CpCo[PO(OR) 2] 3] (NaLOR; R = Me, Et) in water produced the compounds M(CO) 3 (LoR). The two compounds M(CO) 3 (LoEt) were structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray crystallography. In both cases, the ligand LOEt was bound to the metal center in a tridentate fashion utilizing an 000 donor set. The ligands LOR can be used as models for facially coordinated triaqua groups owing to their position in the spectrochemical series. Therefore, these four compounds, M(CO) 3 (LoR), can be considered structural models for [M(H 2 O) 3 (CO) 3]+. The reaction of [Re(CO) 3 (sol) 3]+ (<b>sol</b> = <b>H</b> 20, MeOH, MeCN) with K[HB(pz) 3] (KTp) has yielded a variety of products depending on the solvent used. For the two protic solvents, mixtures of TpRe(CO) 3 and a byproduct (NEt 4) [Re 2 (CO) 6 (jg-pz) 2 ([t-OR) ] (R = H or Me) were obtained. The methoxy-bridged species has been isolated and fully characterized, and the crystal structure has been determined. While a chemical separation of the analogous hydroxy-bridged species from TpRe(CO) 3 was not accomplished, a crystal of the compound was selected from the mixture, and a partial crystal structure was solved. When an aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile was used, only TpRe(CO) 3 was obtained and was recovered in high yield. (cont.) Chapter Two: N-(2 -mercaptoethyl) picolylamine (MEPAH) was studied as a potentially biologically relevant ligand for the 'fac-[M(CO) 3]+" core (M = Re, 99 Tc, 99 mTc). To this end, the complex Re(CO) 3 (MEPA) was synthesized. The reaction of MEPAH with fac-[Re(CO) 3 (MeCN) 3]+ took place over the course of seconds, showing the high affinity possessed by this ligand for the "fac-[Re(CO) 3]+" core. A single crystal X-ray diffraction study was performed, confirming the nature of Re(CO) 3 (MEPA), a rare mononuclear rhenium(I) thiolate complex. Exploration into derivatization of the ligand backbone has afforded the analogous N-ethyl complex, Re(CO) 3 (MEPA-NEt). Further work has given rhenium complexes of bioconjugated ligands, whereby biologically active molecules have been tethered to the ligand framework. The high affinity of the ligand for the metal, coupled with the ease of its derivatization, implies that this ligand system is promising for the purposes of 99 mTc radiopharmaceutical development. Chapter Three: The bioevaluation of 99 mTc complexes of derivatives of MEPAH is described. Complexes analogous to the tricarbonylrhenium(I) complexes described in Chapter 2 were synthesized and characterized by HPLC. After confirmation of the composition of these 99 mTc complexes, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed. These compounds of the "fac-[99 mTc(CO) 3]+' core, containing the biologically active molecules morpholine and nornicotine, were evaluated for uptake by melanoma and brain tissue, respectively, in mice. by Daniel Joshua Kramer.

40|$|Group I {{projections}} from intrinsic plantar {{muscles to}} motoneurones (MNs) of human leg and thigh muscles were investigated. Changes in firing probability of single motor units (MUs) in the tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus brevis (Per brev), soleus (Sol), gastrocnemius medialis (GM), vastus lateralis (VL), semitendinosus (ST) and biceps (Bi) were studied after electrical stimuli applied to: (i) the tibial nerve (TN) at ankle level, (ii) the corresponding homonymous nerve, and (iii) {{the skin of}} the heel, to mimic the TN-induced cutaneous sensation. Homonymous facilitation, attributable to monosynaptic Ia excitation, was found in all the sampled units. Early heteronymous excitation elicited by TN stimulation was found in many MUs. Later effects (3 – 5 ms central delay) were bigger and more frequently observed: excitation in most TA and Per brev MUs, and inhibition in most Sol, GM and Bi MUs and in many ST and VL MUs. The low threshold (∼ 0. 5 – 0. 6 × motor threshold) and the inability of a pure cutaneous stimulation to reproduce these effects (except the late excitation in TA MUs) indicate that they were due to stimulation of group I muscle afferents. The early excitation was accepted to be monosynaptic when its central delay differed from that of the homonymous Ia excitation by less than 0. 5 ms. Such a significant TN-induced monosynaptic Ia excitation was found in MUs belonging to all leg and thigh motor nuclei tested. Although its mean strength was relatively weak, it is argued that these monosynaptic connections might affect already depolarized MNs. The late excitation found in TA and Per brev MUs is argued to be mediated through interneurones located rostral to MNs. The late suppression, found in most Sol, GM and Bi MUs, and in many ST and VL MUs, was the dominant effect. It was accompanied by an inhibition of the <b>Sol</b> and quadriceps <b>H</b> reflexes at rest, and therefore reflects an inhibition directed to MNs. Its long latency is argued to reflect transmission by interneurones located rostral to MNs (the inhibitory counterpart of non-monosynaptic excitation). The functional implications of these connections are discussed with respect to the requirements of the stance phase of human walking and running...|$|R
40|$|The {{source of}} Galactic cosmic rays (with {{energies}} up to 1015 eV) remains unclear, {{although it is}} widely believed that they originate in the shock waves of expanding supernova remnants. At present the best way to investigate their acceleration and propagation is by observing the γ-rays produced when cosmic rays interact with interstellar gas. Here we report observations of an extended region of very-high-energy (> 1011 eV) γ-ray emission correlated spatially with a complex of giant molecular clouds in the central 200 parsecs of the Milky Way. The hardness of the γ-ray spectrum and the conditions in those molecular clouds indicate that the cosmic rays giving rise to the γ-rays are likely to be protons and nuclei rather than electrons. The energy associated with the cosmic rays could have come from a single supernova explosion around 104 years ago. F. Aharonian, A. G. Akhperjanian, A. R. Bazer-Bachi, M. Beilicke, W. Benbow, D.

40|$|Aims. HESS J 1745 - 303 is an extended, {{unidentified}} VHE (very high energy) gamma-ray source discovered using HESS in the Galactic Plane Survey. Since {{no obvious}} counterpart {{has previously been}} found in longer-wavelength data, the processes that power the VHE emission are not well understood. Methods. Combining the latest VHE data with recent XMM-Newton observations {{and a variety of}} source catalogs and lower-energy survey data, we attempt to match (from an energetic and positional standpoint) the various parts of the emission of HESS J 1745 - 303 with possible candidates. Results. Though no single counterpart is found to fully explain the VHE emission, we postulate that at least a fraction of the VHE source may be explained by a supernova-remnant/molecular-cloud association and/or a high-spin-down-flux pulsar.
