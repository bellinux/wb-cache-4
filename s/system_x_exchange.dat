50|$|During the 1970s, Post Office Telecommunications was {{embarking on}} {{upgrading}} the telephone network, {{with the view}} to modernizing the various established mechanical switching devices, consisting mostly of Strowger exchanges, employed in the UK telephone exchanges, and replacing them with an electronic system. This replacement system became known as System X. Concurrently, {{and as part of}} this network upgrade, a dedicated engineering group was formed within the division THQ (Telecoms) to design a call logging system and to establish its feasibility for integration within the various existing Strowger and electronic exchanges, prior to their eventual replacement. A mix of different telephone exchange equipment was selected for trial within Scotland, comprising Strowger pre-2000, 2000 and 4000 type switches located in Director telephone systems and non-Director areas. The call logging trial proved successful and while it was initially designed to gather phone call data and cost of billing details specific to the customers' calls, a hidden benefit emerged such that local management were also able to see a pattern of the types of calls being generated, i.e. calls to and from certain businesses in addition to billing information, which was used to ease flow of traffic during peak times in the exchange and to plan for future customer provision within a catchment area. The concept of this call logging equipment was also deployed in UXD exchanges for remote areas where a <b>System</b> <b>X</b> <b>exchange</b> was not considered feasible.|$|E
50|$|TXE4E was {{the label}} given to TXE4 Enhancement which was {{developed}} by STC and introduced in the late 1980s to update both TXE4 and TXE4A exchanges to provide similar features to those being then provided by <b>System</b> <b>X</b> <b>exchanges,</b> including 'Star Services', CCITT No7 common-channel signalling and itemised call-logging.|$|R
50|$|The 80s were growth {{years for}} the Telecommunications Board despite the {{recession}} which hit the United Kingdom. Many new services were introduced during this time, the most significant {{of which was the}} introduction of <b>System</b> <b>X</b> <b>exchanges</b> island-wide. This computer-controlled system had been developed for British Telecom and had the obvious advantage of allowing Jersey to be completely compatible with the UK network. 1983 saw the 60,000th telephone connected in Jersey which showed a 20,000 increase in just 7 years. All exchanges were replaced with <b>System</b> <b>X</b> or <b>System</b> <b>X</b> remote concentrators by 1994.|$|R
50|$|The {{volume of}} calls grew and a <b>System</b> <b>X</b> digital <b>exchange</b> was {{installed}} and {{was taken over by}} a privatised telephone operator, Gibtelecom, who also operate a GSM network.|$|R
50|$|In April 2010 JT relaunched its Next Generation Networking (NGN) {{programme}} {{which had}} run into technical difficulties the previous autumn. The equipment supplied by UTStarcom will eventually replace its <b>System</b> <b>X</b> <b>exchanges</b> and its existing Marconi Electronic Systems Multi-Service Access Nodes (MSANs). By October 2011 all telephone lines (with the exception of ISDN) were provided over the NGN. This move will enable the company to lower cost and to add new NGN features to its services.|$|R
50|$|Baynard House was {{formerly}} a telephone exchange, and housed the first operational <b>System</b> <b>X</b> telephone <b>exchange,</b> which went live in 1980. The Faraday Building, {{one of the}} first major telephone exchanges in the UK, is nearby.|$|R
50|$|Upon the {{approval}} of the 1969 Constitution and the dissolution of the City Council, the telephone service was transferred to the newly formed Government of Gibraltar. In the 1970s there were three generations of automatic telephone exchange equipment in use with four and five digit numbers. The volume of calls grew and a <b>System</b> <b>X</b> digital <b>exchange</b> was installed.|$|R
50|$|The {{evolution}} of Marconi Communications traces to 1986, when The General Electric Company (GEC) attempted a takeover of Plessey, a British-based international electronics, defence and telecommunications company founded in 1917. The takeover bid was barred by regulatory authorities. As an amicable solution, GEC and Plessey merged their telecommunications businesses on 1 April 1988 as GEC Plessey Telecommunications (GPT). GPT {{was a world}} leader in many fields, for example synchronous digital hierarchy technology, and this brought together the two companies responsible for developing and building the <b>System</b> <b>X</b> telephone <b>exchange,</b> {{which was supposed to}} make selling <b>System</b> <b>X</b> simpler.|$|R

These included Ericsson AXE 10, which would become the world's most popular switching platform, the Western Electric 5ESS used through the US and in many other countries, the German designed Siemens ESWD, the ITT System 12 (later rebranded Alcatel S12) and NEC NEAX all of which were widely used around the world.

This was later renamed BT-CORAL when British Telecom was spun off from the Post Office. Unique features of this language were the focus on real-time execution, message processing, limits on statement execution between waiting for input, and a prohibition on recursion to remove {{the need for a}} stack.|$|R
50|$|Merlin M4000 {{computers}} were commonplace in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, although most {{were sold to}} the public sector as large contracts {{as opposed to the}} private sector. Major customers included the Royal Navy as part of the OASIS II project, and the Department of Social Security. Merlin M4000 {{computers were}} installed in DSS offices across the country where they were used for Case Paper location (tracking files as they moved from one room to another) and calculating benefits. Some M4000 computers were used by the Forestry Commission in their offices, and internally by BT although it is not clear if they were ever used in conjunction with <b>System</b> <b>X</b> telephone <b>exchanges.</b> Many theatres in the UK used Merlin M4000 computers running the RITA booking software that was written either by or in conjunction with the Royal Shakespeare Company.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of computers and}} software engineering in telephone switching systems has dictated the need for powerful design aids for such complex systems. Among these design aids simulators - real-time environment simulators and flat-level simulators - have been found particularly useful in stored program controlled switching systems design and evaluation. However, both types of simulators suffer from certain disadvantages. An alternative methodology to the simulation of stored program controlled switching systems is proposed in this research. The methodology {{is based on the}} development of a process-based multilevel hierarchically structured software simulator. This methodology eliminates the disadvantages of environment and flat-level simulators. It enables the modelling of the system in a 1 to 1 transformation process retaining the sub-systems interfaces and, hence, making it easier to see the resemblance between the model and modelled system and to incorporate design modifications and/or additions in the simulator. This methodology has been applied in building a simulation package for the <b>System</b> <b>X</b> family of <b>exchanges.</b> The Processor Utility Sub-system used to control the exchanges is first simulated, verified and validated. The application sub-systems models are then added one level higher_, resulting in an open-ended simulator having sub-systems models at different levels of detail and capable of simulating any member of the <b>System</b> <b>X</b> family of <b>exchanges.</b> The viability of the methodology is demonstrated by conducting experiments to tune the real-time operating system and by simulating a particular exchange - The Digital Main Network Switching Centre - in order to determine its performance characteristics.

50|$|Due to the {{improved}} electronics TXE4A and TXE4E (or TXE4RD/IW interworking) {{were able to}} receive downloadable updates for tariff data at bank holidays etc., which was a major improvement on the previous Strowger, Crossbar and TXE1-4 tariff change method of manually changing switches on the exchange metering equipment. This downloadable capability enabled the centralised control {{of a lot of}} the manual functions that previously had to be carried out at each exchange. Tariff changes for the eight million customers could be built and implemented by one person following the introduction of a centralised data management tool. At the time this gave a similar capability as available on the <b>System</b> <b>X</b> and AXE10 <b>exchanges.</b>|$|R

However, the omission of Marconi from the BT 21CN supplier list, the lack of a suitable replacement softswitch to match <b>System</b> <b>X</b> reliability, and the shift in focus away from telephony onto broadband - all led to much of the <b>System</b> <b>X</b> estate being maintained.|$|R
40|$|The inuential Krugman-Flood-Garber (KFG) {{model of}} balance of pay-ment crises assumes that a 8 ̆ 5 <b>xed</b> <b>exchange</b> rate is {{abandoned}} if {{and only if}} international reserves reach a critical threshold value. From a positive standpoint, the KFG rule is at odds with many episodes in which the cen-tral bank has plenty of international reserves at the time of abandonment. We study the optimal exit policy and show that, from a normative stand-point, the KFG rule is suboptimal. We consider a model in which the <b>xed</b> <b>exchange</b> rate regime has become unsustainable due to an unexpected increase in government spending. We show that, when there are no exit costs, it is optimal to abandon immediately. When there are exit costs, the optimal abandonment time is a decreasing function {{of the size of the}} scal shock. For large 8 ̆ 5 scal shocks, immediate abandonment is optimal.
