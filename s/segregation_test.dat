The {{purpose of this study}} that was conducted at seedling stage is to formulate a Strategy for Arabica coffee breeding to get resistant varieties to nematode. As the variables of resistance were weight of seedling biomass, percent of root weight deviation, number of root nematodes, number of soil nematodes, reproduction and percent of necrotic root. Using discriminant analysis and fastclus, those data variables were analyzed for genetic of resistance with Statistical Analysis System programme version 8. Genetic study on the inheritance of resistance to R. similiswas started with evaluation of homozigosity of BP 542 A was resistant parent. The result showed that BP 542 A was heterozygous. Therefore, <b>segregation</b> <b>test</b> could not be suggested with segregation pattern principals as Mendel proposed. <b>Segregation</b> <b>test</b> on BP 542 A showed that it was heterozygote and the resistance was controlled by single gene with complete dominant effect, so the progeny segregated in 75 % resistant and 25 % susceptible. The result of the test showed the absence of maternal effect for root weight deviation and percentage of necrotic root variables, which meant that no cytoplasmic inheritance was involved. Based on the test of segregation ratio, almost all of the resistance was not appropriate for monogenic and or digenic segregation pattern as expected due to non allelic gene interaction that caused epistasis.

Single and joint segregation at five protein and four microsatellite loci were analysed in two back-crosses between hybrid females (resulting from domestic×Mediterranean genitors) and hatchery males {{in order to}} test whether there is genetic incompatibility and selective phenomena between the genomes. Three crosses between hatchery genitors were performed and followed in the same time to measure and compare survival among back-cross (2) and hatchery (3) families.

It was found that at the same level of flowability, the superplasticizer demand increases with the content of silica fume. Compared with concrete produced with pure cement, incorporation of 5 % silica fume in the concrete mixtures reduces the segregation stability and passing ability of the concrete, but the reduction is less significant when the silica fume content is increased to 10 %. On the other hand, incorporation of 25 % fly ash in the concrete mixture improves both the segregation stability and passing ability, but the mixtures require higher superplasticizer dosage for a given flowability.

Herein, it is proposed to add pulverized fuel ash (PFA) and/or condensed silica fume (CSF) to improve the robustness of SCC. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} adding these supplementary cementitious materials, an experimental program has been launched, in which thirty batches of concrete containing different amounts of supplementary cementitious materials and different dosages of superplasticizer were produced for testing.

First, genotyping of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) {{were carried out}} using dead offspring from a disease resistance challenge test. Second, AFLP genotyping among survivors followed by a Mendelian <b>segregation</b> <b>test</b> was performed. Third, within-family survival analyses using all offspring were developed and applied to significant TDT markers with Mendelian inheritance. Maximum-likelihood methodology was developed for TDT with dominant markers to exploit linkage disequilibrium within families. The strategy was tested with two full-sib families of Atlantic salmon sired by the same male and consisting of 79 offspring in total. All dead offspring from the two families were typed for 64 primer combinations, resulting in 340 scored markers. There were 26 significant results out of 401 TDTs using dead offspring. In the second stage, only 17 marker families showed Mendelian segregation and were tested in survival analysis. A permutation test was performed for all survival analyses to compute experimentwise P-values.

Little {{is known about the}} identity of predisposing genes. Using an integrative approach, we discovered that CACNG 2 significantly affects susceptibility to chronic pain following nerve injury. CACNG 2 encodes for stargazin, a protein intimately involved in the trafficking of glutamatergic AMPA receptors. The protein might also be a Ca 2 + channel subunit. CACNG 2 has previously been implicated in epilepsy. Initially, using two fine-mapping strategies in a mouse model (recombinant progeny testing [RPT] and recombinant inbred <b>segregation</b> <b>test</b> [RIST]), we mapped a pain-related quantitative trait locus (QTL) (Pain 1) into a 4. 2 -Mb interval on chromosome 15.

Subsequently, bioinformatics and whole-genome microarray expression analysis were used to narrow the list of candidates and ultimately to pinpoint Cacng 2 as a likely candidate. Analysis of stargazer mice, a Cacng 2 hypomorphic mutant, provided electrophysiological and behavioral evidence for the gene's functional role in pain processing. Finally, we showed that human CACNG 2 polymorphisms are associated with chronic pain in a cohort of cancer patients who underwent breast surgery.

However, {{little attention has}} been paid in the literature to this problem and especially to quantifying the stability of powder mixtures to segregation during the conveying and handling operations following a mixing process. This paper gives a theoretical definition of the `robustness' of a powder mixture based on knowledge of the quality of a mixture before and after a <b>segregation</b> <b>test.</b> Specific attention is paid to the problem of homogeneity estimation through sampling. A simple static segregation device, specially developed for this study, is then used for evaluating the robustness of pharmaceutical powder mixtures. The effect of using an excipient, of the same chemical nature but different physical properties, is investigated {{from the point of view}} of size and shape of the particles. In the experiments performed here it is found that particle size has practically no influence on robustness, but it is demonstrated that particle shape has an important effect. Replacing irregular‐shaped particles in a powder mixture by spherical‐shaped particles (such as those produced by spray‐drying) can provoke a dramatic disruption of the structure of a mixture by a simple pouring. Finally, the static segregation device is used as a relative measurement of homogeneity of complex blends consisting of animal feed and aroma.

Considerable efforts to isolate sex-linked genes from dioecious Silene latifolia (Caryophillaceae) have resulted in the isolation of surprisingly few sex-linked genes, suggesting that the methods used previously were not efficient in plants. This chapter analyzes the methods that have been and can be used for isolation of genes from plant sex chromosomes. The most successful method used for the isolation of Y-linked genes included the screening of a male complementary DNA (cDNA) library with the probe obtained by degenerate oligonucleotide-primed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the microdissected Y chromosomes. However, chromosome microdissection requires sophisticated equipment and is difficult to apply to species with cytologically indistinguishable sex chromosomes.

All other ore quality changes were not manipulated, but the segregation by A-Factor affected {{most of the other}} qualities. Magnetic iron, coarse tails, fine tails, silica, and grind changed in response to the split. Segregation was achieved by adding ore from HIS to the Step 3 blend and lowering the amount of LC 1 & 2 and somewhat lowering the amount of LC 3 & 4. Conversely, Step 1 & 2 received less HIS with a corresponding increase in LC 1 & 2. The amount of IBC was increased to both Steps about one-third of the way into the test.

40|$|Three {{full scale}} wall {{elements}} were cast {{with three different}} concretes: an unstable SCC, one stabilized by adding filler, and one stabilized by adding chemical stabilizer. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of the stabilization on the rheology of the SCC and on the final surface quality. All delivered SCC's were rather stone rich and unstable, even the stabilized ones. This was most likely caused by a change in the fines and water content of the sand for which the concrete recipe was not corrected. Even though the SCC's were not as expected certain conclusions could be drawn. All three mixes had a low viscosity and relatively high yield stress indicating segregation. The questionable stability was confirmed by the sieve <b>segregation</b> <b>test,</b> but not by the visual segregation index on the flow board. Stability assed on a hardened concrete cylinder indicated good stability for the unstable and filler stabilized SCC. However, the chemically stabilized concrete showed clear signs of bleeding. Regarding the surface quality of the wall elements, it can be concluded that all surfaces had a similar grey level independent of the type of SCC used or whether or not formwork agent was applied. It is not possible to come to clear conclusions as to how the SCC type or the surface treatment affects the amount of pores. However, there is an indication that the chemical stabilizers can lead to large bleeding pores in the lower part of the surface of the concrete wall, whereas filler stabilization can gives rise to the formation of very fine pores. The fact that all SCC's were on the verge of instability, did not allow for clear rheological differences nor clear differences in final surface quality. 3 D 00594...|$|E
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a Grain-positive, facultative {{intracellular}} bacterium {{that causes}} severe infections in {{the nervous system}} of domestic animals and humans. Rhombencephalitis (brainstem encephalitis) due to L. monocytogenes, is a localized brainstem infection that is frequent in ruminants, and {{has been reported in}} humans as well. The asymmetric bacterial load, and neuropathological and ultrastructural findings indicate that axonal transport of the bacteria along one or more branches of cranial nerves to the brainstem may be the cause of L. monocytogenes rhombencephalitis. This thesis project aims to use L. monocytogenes as a model to analyze the interactions between a pathogen, a neuron and immune cells. More specifically the goal is to answer how peripheral sensory neurons take up L. monocytogenes to provide a pathway for entry into the brain and how innate and adaptive immune responses, especially the cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-ã), may control the replication and elimination of L. monocytogenes in neuronal cells. The initial experiments showed that L. monocytogenes spreads to the brain via a trigeminal nerve route after snout (where the trigeminal nerve innervates the vibrissae) infection. IFN-ã plays a protective role in such neuroinvasion; inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) accounts partially for the protection. M< cells played the protective role in neuroinvasion by releasing IFN-ã but not through a perforin-dependent mechanism. By using mice lacking colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF- 1), and thereby deficient in macrophages and dendritic cells, we showed that these cells play a dual role: they constitute a major defense against systemic infection but they also facilitate L. monocytogenes brain invasion along the trigeminal nerves. In an in vitro system, L. monocytogenes could infect both axons and nerve cell bodies of rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons; they migrated in both retrograde and anterograde directions. Primary cultures of fetal mouse hippocampal neurons (PHN) and a neuronal cell line derived from mouse hypothalamus were infected by L. monocytogenes. Treatment with IFN-ã did not affect bacterial uptake, but resulted in increased killing of intracellular bacteria as measured by a plasmid <b>segregation</b> <b>test.</b> IFN-ã-mediated bacterial killing mapped to the infected neuronal cytosol, before listerial actin tail formation. Treatment with IFN-ã induced phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT 1 in neurons. In turn, IFN-ã-mediated listerial killing was not observed in STAT 1 -/- neurons or in neurons treated with inhibitory interferon regulatory factor (IRF- 1) antisense oligonucleotides. IFN-ã-treated neurons showed higher levels of iNOS mRNA; iNOS antagonists and antisense iNOS oligonucleotides hampered the protective effect of IFN-ã-treatment, while neuronal NOS (nNOS) inhibitors had no effect. This novel neuronal function, i. e. that of a microbe killer, could {{play a crucial role in}} the control of infections in the immunoprivileged nervous system. Co-incubation of L. monocytogenes-infected PHN with spleen cells from immune (re-infected) but not uninfected or infected animals also reduced the intraneuronal bacteria. This is likely due to direct neuron-T cell interactions. CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells were needed for spleen cell-mediated L. monocytogenes control, which was both perform- and IFN-ã-dependent and was partially inhibited in absence of MHC-class I antigen. In conclusion, this thesis further defines the role of immune responses in controlling dissemination to and replication of L. monocytogenes in the brain. The results showed that L. monocytogenes can spread to the brain via a neural route and that IFN-ã plays a protective role in bacterial neuroinvasion. CSF- 1 -dependent cells facilitate the neuroinvasion but also control systemic infections. Our data suggest that neurons can not only allow spread of bacteria into the brain, but they may also kill the bacteria upon stimulation with IFN-ã, which defines a new property of neurons that should be considered for understanding the interactions between a nerve cell and a pathogen...|$|E

For each concrete mix designed, the superplasticiser dosages for maximum slump flow without segregation and maximum filling height were determined. It was found that the maximum performance of the concrete mix and the respective required superplasticiser dosage are dependent on the w/c and F/T aggregate ratios. In general, increasing the F/T aggregate ratio would improve the maximum performance but would also increase the superplasticiser dosage needed.

Within an electrophoretic mobility class, the Adh 1 allele that is relatively underexpressed in the scutellum is relatively overexpressed in the primary root, and vice versa. <b>Segregation</b> <b>tests</b> prove that this "reciprocal effect" is the property of a cis-acting site that is closely linked to or within the Adh 1 structural gene, {{and it is not}} affected by diverse genetic backgrounds. Immunological and [3 H]-leucine incorporation experiments establish that Adh 1 quantitative variants differ in ADH 1 ·ADH 1 synthetic rates in the anaerobic primary root. The reciprocal-effect phenomenon suggests that the cis-acting loci controlling Adh 1 quantitative expression in each respective organ are at least in close proximity, or may share common DNA sequences. We discuss the possibility that the reciprocal-effect locus is a regulatory component of the Adh 1 cistron...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} experimental programme {{has been}} carried out to study the effects of fine: 10 mm: 20 mm aggregate proportions on the passing ability and segregation stability of self-consolidating concrete, A total of 18 trial concrete mixes with water/cementitious materials ratios ranging from 0 - 30 to 0 - 36 and different combinations of fine and coarse aggregates were produced. In each mix, the paste volume was set at 35 %, and pulverised fuel ash, condensed silica fume and a third-generation superplasticiser were added at dosages of 25 %, 5 % and 3 % respectively. All the mixes were tested to have slump flow well above 700 mm. However, not all have satisfactory passing ability and segregation stability, as revealed by J-ring, U-box and sieve <b>segregation</b> <b>tests.</b> The cohesiveness and coarse aggregate content appeared to be the major factors as the passing ability and segregation stability were generally better for mixes with higher cohesiveness and lower coarse aggregate content. Nevertheless, some of the mixes may be considered for making high-strength, self-consolidating concrete. They have the common characteristics of 20 mm aggregate content ≤ 10 mm aggregate content and coarse aggregate content ≤ fine aggregate content. © 2006 Thomas Telford Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|For the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, powder segregation {{can occur in}} many processes such as blending and compression solid dose unit operations. Yet {{it is important that}} the high quality standards of drug product manufacture are maintained throughout the whole processes. Powder segregation has been identified by {{the pharmaceutical}} industry as a potential issue, and in some cases it may cause variability in tablet assay and uniformity throughout a compression run. Early studies suggested for certain Direct Compression (DC) products, the separation of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) from excipients could arise due to air-induced segregation of the powders discharging from an Intermediate Bulk Container (IBC) to the tablet press via a vertical chute. <b>Segregation</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out on trial powder blend materials supplied by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), using a laboratory-scale air elutriation test facility at The Wolfson Centre. Particle size analysis of the virgin and segregated sub-samples clearly indicated that powder segregation occurred as a result of aerodynamic effects. Subsequent chemical assay results concurred with the particle size results. Flowability testing of the powder blends indicated them to be free-flowing materials; this in addition to the presence of large particle size differentials within the powder blends is the likely cause of the susceptibility to air-induced segregation...|$|R
40|$|Summary Segregation is {{a complex}} {{mechanism}} that leads to separation of various particulate fractions in bulk solids. The nucleation and acceleration of segregation can potentially happen at various stages in the process or handling of a given bulk particulate. Any bulk solid composed of particulates under 50 μm size range and exhibiting variations in particle characteristics can be susceptible to air induced segregation. The pharmaceutical sector uses many types of dry powders exhibiting these characteristics in various manufacturing processes and products. The presented work was undertaken to evaluate the susceptibility of an exemplar pharmaceutical blend to segregate {{under the influence of}} counter current air-flow using a bench size tester. The results of the <b>segregation</b> <b>tests</b> have then been used to predict the variation in the fine particles (often active content) of the bulk particulate. The techniques for minimising segregation are largely dependent on establishing the most dominant mode governing the segregation mechanism (in particular process and handling conditions). The air induced segregation tester {{has been shown to be}} a useful and reliable tool for predicting the propensity of fine powder blends to be susceptible to counter air current segregation, while the QPM segregation tester has been proven to indicate the propensity for surface segregatio...|$|R
40|$|The mid- 1980 s {{witnessed}} {{breaks in}} two important trends related to race and schooling. School segregation, {{which had been}} declining, began a period of relative stasis. Black-white test score gaps, which had also been declining, also stagnated. The notion that these two phenomena may be related is also supported by basic cross-sectional evidence. We review existing literature {{on the relationship between}} neighborhood- and school-level <b>segregation</b> and the <b>test</b> score gap. Several recent studies point to a statistically significant causal relationship between school <b>segregation</b> and the <b>test</b> score gap, though in many cases the magnitude of the relationship is small in economic terms. Experimental studies, as well as methodologically convincing non-experimental studies, suggest that there is little if any causal role for neighborhood segregation operating through a mechanism other than school segregation. ...|$|R
40|$|Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) and Early Childhood Onset Severe Retinal Dystrophy are {{clinically}} and genetically heterogeneous retinal disorders characterised by {{visual impairment}} and nystagmus from birth or early infancy. We investigated the prevalence of sequence variants in AIPL 1 in a large cohort of such patients (n = 392) and probed the likelihood of disease-causation of the identified variants, subsequently undertaking a detailed assessment of the phenotype of patients with disease-causing mutations. Genomic DNA samples were screened for known variants in the AIPL 1 gene using a microarray LCA chip, with 153 of these cases then being directly sequenced. The assessment of disease-causation of identified AIPL 1 variants included <b>segregation</b> <b>testing,</b> assessing evolutionary conservation and in silico predictions of pathogenicity. The chip identified AIPL 1 variants in 12 patients. Sequencing of AIPL 1 in 153 patients and 96 controls found a total of 46 variants, with 29 being novel. In silico analysis suggested that only 6 of these variants {{are likely to be}} diseasecausing, indicating a previously unrecognized high degree of polymorphism. Seven patients were identified with biallelic changes in AIPL 1 likely to be disease-causing. In the youngest subject, electroretinography revealed reduced cone photoreceptor function, but rod responses were within normal limits, with no measurable ERG in other patients. An increasing degree and extent of peripheral retinal pigmentation and degree of maculopathy was noted with increasing ag...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} deals with {{optimizing}} the flow and segregation properties of levocetirizine hydrochloride formulation, where the delay between homogenization and tablet compression {{was found to}} affect the tablet content uniformity. In addition to API, the base formulation comprised spray dried lactose monohydrate, milled lactose monohydrate 200 mesh, Avicel PH 101 microcrystalline cellulose, and minor excipients. Several alternative mixtures were prepared using the same total composition, but different grades of lactose and microcrystalline cellulose. These mixtures were then <b>tested</b> for the <b>segregation</b> behavior in an in-house segregation device and the flow properties using the Freeman FT 4 powder rheometer. The <b>segregation</b> <b>tests</b> showed the grade of lactose is essential for mixture in-flow segregation. While SD lactose mixtures increased the API content in a direction countercurrent to flow, the milled lactose mixtures segregated API concurrently. Mixtures using both lactose grades showed combined effect, resulting in the least segregation due to the two segregation processes competing with each other. However, the segregation was extremely sensitive to ageing of the mixture. It was also found that each type of lactose causes a different flow regime of the mixture in process vessels. In order to improve the content uniformity of the tablets, it was found the volumetric flow regime of transport to tablet press is required {{as well as the}} aggregate formation should be prevented. ...|$|R
