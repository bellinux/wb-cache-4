5|$|Both {{in private}} and public performances, Mendelssohn was also renowned for his improvisations. On one {{occasion}} in London, when asked by the soprano Maria Malibran after a recital to extemporise, he created a piece which included the melodies of all the songs she had sung. The music publisher Victor Novello who was present remarked 'He has done some things that <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> impossible, even after I have heard them done.' At another recital in 1837, where Mendelssohn played the piano for a singer, Robert Schumann ignored the soprano and wrote 'Mendelssohn accompanied like a God'.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E

60|$|At least, so it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{the first}} day that I went, awe struck, into the High Woods; and so it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the last day that I came, even more awe-struck, out of them.|$|R
25|$|Marxian {{economics}} {{seems to}} me {{for the most part}} either false or obsolete or meaningless in application to contemporary economic phenomena. Those aspects of Marxian economics which retain validity do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to justify the theoretical structure of the economics.|$|E
25|$|The amiable Rev. James Sherman, at {{that time}} {{minister}} of Surrey Chapel, with his accustomed kindness took me in his carriage to the dinner; and afterwards, for four months, not only made me his guest, but made his house my home. I never lived so long with any other person, on the same terms. While I live, that dear gentleman will <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as a most generous fatherly friend.|$|E

6000|$|... "I may be wrong, Comrade Parker," [...] he said, [...] "but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that the}} chances of my getting hurt are not so great as you appear to imagine.

500|$|..... these {{poems are}} all in a {{particular}} set form which I have elaborated, and the word [...] "quartet" [...] does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to start people {{on the right track}} for understanding them ("sonata" [...] in any case is too musical). It suggests to me the notion of making a poem by weaving in together three or four superficially unrelated themes: the [...] "poem" [...] being the degree of success in making a new whole out of them.|$|E
500|$|Ginsburg characterizes her {{performance}} on the Court as a cautious approach to adjudication. She argued in a speech shortly before her nomination to the Court that [...] motions <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> right, in the main, for constitutional as well as common law adjudication. Doctrinal limbs too swiftly shaped, experience teaches, may prove unstable." [...] Legal scholar Cass Sunstein has characterized Ginsburg as a [...] "rational minimalist", a jurist who seeks to build cautiously on precedent rather than pushing the Constitution towards her own vision.|$|E
500|$|Ill from {{drink and}} {{suffering}} from smoker's cough, in February 1888 Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles. He {{seems to have}} moved with thoughts of founding an art colony. The Danish artist Christian Mourier-Petersen became his companion for two months, and at first Arles appeared exotic. In a letter, he {{described it as a}} foreign country: [...] "The Zouaves, the brothels, the adorable little Arlésienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> creatures from another world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so different," [...] he said sadly, [...] "it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> you {{can live}} your own life, and be independent, and think as you like without being choked with harassments. I feel as if I could keep on—like that——" ...|$|R
5000|$|Balch {{converted}} from Unitarianism {{and became a}} Quaker in 1921. She stated, [...] "Religion <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{one of the most}} interesting things in life, one of the most puzzling, richest and thrilling fields of human thought and speculation... religious experience and thought need also a light a day and sunshine and a companionable sharing with others of which it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> there is generally too little... The Quaker worship at its best <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> give opportunities for this sort of sharing without profanation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the most}} terrible thing in likenesses I have ever seen," [...] the woman {{continued}} slowly. [...] "When you entered the room a few seconds ago, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that a miracle had happened. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the dead had come to life." ...|$|R
500|$|Chapter VIII {{addresses}} {{the idea that}} species had special characteristics that prevented hybrids from being fertile {{in order to preserve}} separately created species. Darwin said that, far from being constant, the difficulty in producing hybrids of related species, and the viability and fertility of the hybrids, varied greatly, especially among plants. Sometimes what were widely considered to be separate species produced fertile hybrid offspring freely, and in other cases what were considered to be mere varieties of the same species could only be crossed with difficulty. Darwin concluded: [...] "Finally, then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> opposed to, but even rather to support the view, that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties." ...|$|E
500|$|The four valses-caprices {{are not a}} cycle, {{but rather}} two sets of two, [...] the first [...] from Fauré's early period and the second from his middle period. Morrison calls all four [...] "more 'caprice' than 'waltz, and {{comments}} that they combine and develop the scintillating style of Chopin and Saint-Saëns waltzes. They show Fauré at his most playful, presenting variations before the theme is heard and darting {{in and out of}} unexpected keys. [...] Aaron Copland, though generally a keen admirer of Fauré's music, wrote, [...] "the several Valses-Caprices, in spite of their admirable qualities, <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> essentially foreign to Faure's esprit. His is too orderly, too logical a mind to be really capricious." [...] Cortot, by contrast, spoke approvingly of their [...] "sensual grace... perfect distinction... impassioned tenderness." ...|$|E
500|$|Shōshi was 16 to 19 when Murasaki {{joined her}} court. According to Arthur Waley, Shōshi was a serious-minded young lady, whose living {{arrangements}} were divided between her father's household and her court at the Imperial Palace. She gathered around her talented women {{writers such as}} Izumi Shikibu and Akazome Emon—the author of an early vernacular history, The Tale of Flowering Fortunes. The rivalry that existed among the women is evident in Murasaki's diary, where she wrote disparagingly of Izumi: [...] "Izumi Shikibu is an amusing letter-writer; {{but there is something}} not very satisfactory about her. She has a gift for dashing off informal compositions in a careless running-hand; but in poetry she needs either an interesting subject or some classic model to imitate. Indeed it does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that in herself she is really a poet at all." ...|$|E

6000|$|This moment yearning and thoughtful, sitting alone, It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{there are}} other men in other lands, yearning and thoughtful; It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I can look over and behold them in Prussia, Italy, France, [...] Spain--or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or India--talking [...] other dialects; And it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> if I could know those men, I should become {{attached}} to [...] them, as I do to men in my own lands. O I know we should be brethren and lovers; I know I should be happy with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he {{presently}} said, [...] "I {{take from}} {{you what you}} give me, and I suppose that, to be consistent--to stand on my feet where I do stand at all--I ought to thank you. Only, you know, what you give <b>me</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{more than anything else}}, the larger and larger size of my job. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> more than anything else what you expect of <b>me.</b> It never <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> somehow what I may expect of you. There's so much you don't give me." ...|$|R
500|$|Armstrong {{prepared}} {{his famous}} epigram on his own. In a post-flight press conference, {{he said that}} he decided on the words [...] "just prior to leaving the LM [...]" [...] In a 1983 interview in Esquire Magazine, Armstrong explained to George Plimpton: [...] "I always knew there was a good chance of being able to return to Earth, but I thought the chances of a successful touchdown on the moon surface were about even money—fifty–fifty... Most people don't realize how difficult the mission was. So it didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> there was much point in thinking of something to say if we'd have to abort landing." [...] In 2012, brother Dean Armstrong claimed that Neil had shown him a note with a draft of the line months before the launch, although historian Andrew Chaikin, who had interviewed the astronaut in 1988 for his book A Man on the Moon, disputed that he had ever claimed coming up with the line spontaneously during the mission.|$|E
500|$|Boyd {{has said}} that he prefers to believe the {{overdose}} was accidental. He recalled that Drake's parents had described his mood in the preceding weeks as having been very positive, and that he had planned to move back to London to restart his music career. Boyd believes that this uplift in spirits was followed by a [...] "crash back into despair". Reasoning that Drake may have taken a high dosage of antidepressants to recapture this sense of optimism, he said he prefers to imagine Drake [...] "making a desperate lunge for life rather than a calculated surrender to death". Writing in 1975, NME journalist Nick Kent commented on the irony of Drake's death {{at a time when he}} had just begun to regain a sense of [...] "personal balance". In contrast, Gabrielle Drake has said she prefers to think her brother committed suicide, [...] "in the sense that I'd rather he died because he wanted to end it than it to be the result of a tragic mistake. That would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to be terrible." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the synagogue}} had {{undertaken}} innovations {{in some areas}} of Jewish law, it still insisted on strict adherence in others. In 1878 Tinter was dismissed for officiating at the marriage of a Jewish woman and Christian man, and Baith Israel was, for a time, the only congregation in Brooklyn that celebrated Jewish holidays for the traditional two days. In 1889 Baith Israel asserted it was [...] "the only orthodox congregation in the city", and that year the board forced the resignation of a Mr. J. Folkart, for transgressing the laws of Yom Kippur. In 1892, when Hyman Rosenberg was expelled as rabbi of Brooklyn's Beth Jacob synagogue for eating ham, the Brooklyn Eagle canvassed local rabbis for their views on the matter. While George Taubenhaus, rabbi of Beth Elohim stated, [...] "I do not believe my congregation would expel me if I ate ham", Baith Israel's rabbi Friedlander responded, [...] "While there are some differences between the reform and orthodox Jews, I do not think it is the place for any Jewish minister to eat ham. The reformers do not so strictly observe the old Mosaic law, but it does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a good example for a rabbi to set to his congregation." ...|$|E

[...] "Nay, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that {{till they}} were over, I never thought at all except {{how to get}} the most rollicking and the finest rowing out of life. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I had about as much sense as a green monkey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> your Grace," [...] I cried, angry all at once, [...] "it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I {{am the one}} to {{whom you}} should address your wagers. I am not a jockey, to be put up at your whim, and {{to give you the}} chance to lose money." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I incline to the idealistic {{theory that}} {{consciousness}} is fundamental, {{and that the}} material universe is derivative from consciousness, not consciousness from the material universe... In general the universe <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be nearer to a great thought than to a great machine. It may well be, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> that each individual consciousness ought to be compared to a brain-cell in a universal mind.|$|R
500|$|Some {{families}} of servicemen and servicewomen {{who were killed}} in Iraq reacted angrily to the book, in which Blair does not apologise for the invasion. [...] "I can't regret the decision to go to war. I can say never did I guess the bloody, destructive and chaotic nightmare that unfolded—and that too is part of the responsibility," [...] he says in the book. Reg Keys, whose son Tom Keys was killed in Iraq in 2003, said that the book was [...] "just crocodile tears from Blair." [...] Keys said, [...] "The tears he claims to have shed are nothing like the tears I and my wife have shed for our son. They are nothing like the tears that tens of thousands of Iraqis have shed for their loved ones. They don't even come close to it. They <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like crocodile tears. It is a cynical attempt to sanitise his legacy." [...] A spokesperson for Military Families Against the War said that Blair's expression of regret over the loss of life was [...] "completely meaningless." [...] The spokesperson added, [...] "He has to prove his regret and giving money to charity doesn't come close. He is giving a minuscule amount compared to the cost of war and rehabilitation of injured soldiers. It is laughable." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "A. {{tries to}} justify himself {{by saying that}} {{everyone}} did it, which doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{to be a good}} defense at all. It is too much in the two-wrongs-make-a-right plan to suit your humble servant." ...|$|E
2500|$|William Butler Yeats was {{generally}} critical of Poe, calling him [...] "vulgar." [...] Of [...] "The Pit and the Pendulum" [...] in particular he said, [...] " [...] not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to have permanent literary value of any kind...

2500|$|The Mishnah {{interpreted}} the words, [...] "there <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be {{as it were}} a plague in the house," [...] in [...] to teach that even a learned sage who knows that he has definitely seen a sign of plague in a house may not speak with certainty. Rather, even the sage must say, [...] "there <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be as it were a plague in the house." ...|$|R
