She {{returned}} fire when the Bolsheviks began to bombard Kronstadt Island and was hit by three 12-inch shells that killed or wounded 102 sailors. After the rebellion was bloodily crushed, she was renamed Parizhskaya Kommuna after the Paris Commune on 31 March 1921. She was refitted several times before she was recommissioned on 17 September 1925. She was refitted again in 1928 at the Baltic Shipyard, in preparation for her transfer to the Black Sea Fleet. Her forward funnel was raised and the upper part was angled aft {{in an attempt to}} keep the exhaust gases out of the control and gunnery spaces, while three 3-inch 'Lender' AA guns were added to the roofs of the fore and aft turrets. She received some additional rangefinders and she was given a false bow to improve her sea-keeping ability. She sailed for the Black Sea on 22 November 1929, in company of the cruiser Profintern, encountering a bad storm in the Bay of Biscay. The open-topped bow lacked enough drainage and tended to trap a lot of water which badly damaged both the false bow and the <b>supporting</b> <b>structure.</b> Parizhskaya Kommuna was forced to put into Brest for repairs, which included the removal of the bulwark that retained so much water. Both ships arrived at Sevastopol on 18 January 1930 and Parizhskaya Kommuna became the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The lack {{of jobs in}} South Africa and eMalahleni {{has caused}} many young people to seek their own job {{opportunities}} {{in the form of}} setting up their own business. Despite this, many young business people fail in their ventures due to low capital. In response to this, organisations such as the National Youth Development Agency have created <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> to <b>support</b> young business owners in their local area. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the extent to which the structures and programmes to support youth development – as far as entrepreneurship is concerned – help to cultivate the creation of businesses among the black youth in eMalahleni. Thirty participants who are young entrepreneurs (under 35 years) participated in interviews that helped to elucidate qualitative information about the <b>support</b> <b>structures.</b> They were asked how the <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> had helped them if they participated, or the reasons why they chose not to use the <b>support</b> <b>structure.</b> They were also asked to identify potential bottlenecks or issues with the <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> that may be preventing them from being fully accessible. The results showed that a lack of trust in the <b>support</b> <b>structures,</b> particularly those created by the National Youth Development Agency, was a major reason for non-participation or choice not to use. Additionally, many felt that the hierarchy and unwelcoming atmosphere of the <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> prevented young people from applying. Other reasons given were the fact that the <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> may not always be geographically accessible and the fact that staff members were not fully trained to be as helpful as possible. There are several ways in which these <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> could be improved that are detailed in this research document. The most important recommendation relates to ensuring that the red tape is removed to make the <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> more helpful to a larger number of young black entrepreneurs.

40|$|By {{accounting}} for almost 25 % {{of the capital}} cost of an OWT (offshore wind turbine), optimisation of <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> provides {{an efficient way to}} reduce the currently high cost of offshore wind energy. In this paper, a structural optimisation model for OWT <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> has been developed based on a coupled parametric FEA (Finite Element Analysis) and GA (Genetic Algorithm), minimising the mass of the <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> under multi-criteria constraints. Contrary to existing optimisation models for OWT <b>support</b> <b>structures,</b> the proposed model is an integrated structural optimisation model, which optimises the components of the <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> (i. e. tower, transition piece, grout and monopile) simultaneously. The outer diameters and section thicknesses along the <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> are chosen as design variables. A set of constraints based on multi-criteria design assessment is applied according to standard requirements, which includes vibration, stress, deformation, buckling, fatigue and design variable constraints. The model has been applied to the NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) 5 MW OWT on an 00 (Offshore Code Comparison Collaboration) monopile. The results of the application of the integrated optimisation methodology show a 19. 8 % reduction in the global mass of the <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> while satisfying all the design constraints. It is demonstrated that the proposed structural optimisation model is capable of effectively and accurately determining the optimal design of OWT <b>support</b> <b>structures,</b> which significantly improves their design efficiency.

Various challenges for a metal powder based process include reducing the staircase effect which leads to poor surface finish of the part, and minimal use of <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> for regions with overhangs or internal hollow volumes. Part build orientation is a crucial process parameter which affects part quality, in particular, Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing (GD&T) errors on the part, the energy expended and the extent of <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> required. This paper provides an approach to identify an optimal build orientation which will minimize the volume of <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> while meeting the specified GD&T criteria of the part for a DMLS based process. Siemens PLM NX API is used to extract the GD&T callouts and associated geometric information of the CAD model.
