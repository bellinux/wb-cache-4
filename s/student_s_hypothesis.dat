40|$|The plasma {{spheroidization}} system (PSS) is {{the first}} process {{in the development of}} tungsten-uranium dioxide (W-UO 2) fuel cermets. The PSS process improves particle spherocity and surface morphology for coating by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. Angular fully dense particles melt in an argon-hydrogen plasma jet at between 32 - 36 kW, and become spherical due to surface tension. Surrogate CeO 2 powder was used in place of UO 2 for system and process parameter development. Particles range in size from 100 - 50 microns in diameter. <b>Student</b> <b>s</b> t-test and <b>hypothesis</b> testing of two proportions statistical methods were applied to characterize and compare the spherocity of pre and post process powders.

It is recommended that powders be processed two-three times in order to reach the desired spherocity, and that process parameters be optimized for a more narrow particles size range.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to examine the role of crosslinguistic {{influence}} in the acquisition of wh-questions by Korean-English bilingual children. Specifically, the goal is to test Hulk and Müller 2 ̆ 7 s (2000) syntax-pragmatics interface hypothesis, which advocates the existence of crosslinguistic influence and suggests that the syntax-pragmatics interface, or the C(omplementizer) -domain, is an area that is most vulnerable to influence. They predict that crosslinguistic influence is likely to occur if (a) the construction in question is relevant to the syntax-pragmatics interface, and (b) if there is surface overlap between the two features. The present study looks at the production of wh -questions by Korean-English bilingual children to test Hulk and Müller 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> Since wh-questions in these languages involve the C-domain and show a surface overlap, the hypothesis predicts that Korean will influence English. In the bilinguals 2 ̆ 7 English, we should expect to see more wh-in-situ constructions than for monolingual English speakers. ^ Seven Korean-English bilingual children who reside in the U. S. Midwest were observed for the present study. Their ages ranged from 3; 4 to 5; 5 at the onset of the study, and the children were recorded every 2 - 4 weeks for approximately 11 months in spontaneous play interactions. Contrary to what Hulk and Müller 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> predicts, the results show no wh-in-situ constructions from the bilingual children. All utterances containing wh-words, both in the main clause and in embedded clauses, have undergone movement. Hulk and Müller 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> fails to explain the data that we observe for these Korean-English bilingual children. Rather than applying wh-in-situ to English question formation, these children all satisfy the movement required in English. Possible explanations of results, as well as additional findings, will be discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in individuals being treated for eating disorder at the residential level of care. The objective {{of this study was to}} inform collectively the multiple paradigms that have power in the treatment decisions for individual 2 ̆ 7 s seeking clinical care for an eating disorder, i. e. clinicians, payers, policy-makers, friends and family, and the afflicted person. Residential treatment is often overlooked or dismissed as a primary level of care, due to a lack of insurance and other third-party payment. The intension of this research study is to build support for a 360 -degree assessment including physical, behavioral, mental, emotional, and existential transformation with this population. Method: Data collection began in August 2011 and concluded August 2012. There were three unique test-times, (1) admission, (2) discharge, and (3) three-month post-discharge follow-up. The researcher analyzed the change in HRQOL between these three test times as well as correlational relationships between the change in HRQOL and change in depressive and eating disorder symptomatology, utilizing the Beck Depression Inventory, second edition and the Eating Disorder Inventory, third edition. Finally, the research investigated the relationship between duration of illness and HRQOL. Results: Preliminary data support the researcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypotheses</b> that residential treatment is an effective model for treating individuals with severe eating disorders as evidenced by HRQOL at discharge and three month follow-up. Furthermore, there were negative correlational relationships between the change in HRQOL and change in symptoms from admission to discharge, ultimately supporting the researcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that during the course of residential treatment subjects 2 ̆ 7 HRQOL improves and symptoms decrease. Contrary to the researcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> duration of illness did not have any relationship with the subjects 2 ̆ 7 change in quality of life from admission to discharge.

A 360 -degree approach is warranted in assessment and evaluation of treatment and discharge readiness. This study, though preliminary, provides significant data that can be used to inform multidisciplinary clinicians, policy-makers, third-party payers, and friends and family seeking counsel...|$|R
