40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThis thesis aims at {{developing}} a <b>sorting</b> <b>code</b> for Coulomb excitation studies at iThemba LABS. In Coulomb excitation reactions, the inelastic scattering of the projectile transfers {{energy to the}} partner nucleus (and vice-versa) through a time-dependent electromagnetic field. At energies well below the Coulomb barrier, the particles interact solely through the well known electromagnetic interaction, thereby excluding nuclear excitations from the process. The data can therefore be analyzed using a semiclassical approximation. The <b>sorting</b> <b>code</b> was used to process and analyze data acquired from the Coulomb excitation of 20 Ne beams at 73 and 96 MeV, onto a 194 Pt target. The detection of gamma rays was done using the AFRODITE HPGe clover detector array, which consists of nine clover detectors, in coincidence with the 20 Ne particles detected with an S 3 double-sided silicon detector. The new <b>sorting</b> <b>code</b> includes Doppler-correction effects, charge-sharing, energy and time conditions, kinematics and stopping powers, among others, {{and can be used}} for any particle-γ coincidence measurements at iThemba LABS. Results from other Coulomb excitation measurements at iThemba LABS will also be presented...|$|R

Researchers also begin considering how relationships are formed between codes and themes and between different levels of existing themes.
