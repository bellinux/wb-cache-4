25|$|In 1991 Brinkley was {{considered}} to have the ideal, all-American look with her blonde hair, blue eyes, <b>slim</b> <b>figure,</b> and soft features, when Allure first conducted a survey taking {{the pulse of the}} average American (men and women) searching for their beauty perceptions and preferences.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] {{was directed by}} Dawn Shadforth, and featured dance routines choreographed by Michael Rooney. Early in Minogue's career, her youthful look, <b>slim</b> <b>figure,</b> and her [...] "proportionally" [...] large mouth attracted comments from various critics, with British red top newspaper News of the World speculating that the singer could possibly be an alien. Later while discussing the video, Shadforth and music critic Paul Morley took this [...] "bizarre suggestion" [...] into consideration to comment on Minogue as a [...] "creative, experimental artist." [...] Shadforth blocked some shots of the initial driving scene based upon similar shots of Shirley Manson piloting an airplane in her award-winning dogfight clip for Garbage's [...] "Special." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2009, Reubens {{hinted that}} {{negotiations}} were {{under way for}} his stage show to come back, and in August the return of The Pee-wee Herman Show was announced. Reubens said he felt Pee-wee calling, [...] "I just got {{up one day and}} felt like I'm gonna come back, that was it." [...] The show is also a way to [...] "introduce Pee-wee to the new generation that didn't know about it", preparing the way for Reubens' main project, the Playhouse movie. Before this comeback, Reubens' present age and shape had been pointed out as a possible issue, since Pee-wee's <b>slim</b> <b>figure</b> and clean skin have been one of his trademarks. But after appearing {{for the first time since}} 1992 as Pee-wee at Spike TV's 2007 Guys' Choice Awards, Reubens had remained optimistic and had jokingly said he's no longer nervous about being young Pee-wee again thanks to digital retouching.|$|E

25|$|However, by 1886, the {{silhouette}} transformed {{back to a}} <b>slimmer</b> <b>figure</b> again. Sleeves of bodices were thinner and tighter, while necklines became higher again. Furthermore, an even further tailored-look began to develop until it improved in the 1890s.|$|R

500|$|Jackson began {{recording}} her ninth studio album, 20 Y.O., in 2005. She {{recorded with}} producers Dupri, Jam and Lewis {{for several months}} during the following year. The album's title was {{a reference to the}} two decades since the release of her breakthrough album Control, representing the album's [...] "celebration of the joyful liberation and history-making musical style." [...] To promote the album, Jackson appeared in various magazines, and performed on the Today Show and Billboard Awards. Jackson's Us Weekly cover, revealing her <b>slim</b> <b>figure</b> after heavy media focus was placed on her fluctuations in weight, became the magazine's best-selling issue in history. 20 Y.O. was released in September 2006 and debuted at number two on the Billboard200. The album received mixed reviews, with multiple critics chastising the production and involvement of Jermaine Dupri. Rolling Stone disagreed with the album's reference to Control, saying [...] "If we were her, we wouldn't make the comparison." ...|$|E
500|$|Harvey was {{regarded}} as a mercurial batsman of great artistry and style. A short man at 172cm (5ft;8in), he batted with aggression, and was known for his timing of the ball. His batting against spin bowling in particular was a crowd pleaser, highlighted by his extravagant footwork in charging the bowlers. Harvey often charged five paces down the pitch to spinners, with one bowler quipping [...] "He kept coming so far along the track toward me that I thought he must want to shake my hands". Despite running out of the crease so much, Harvey was never stumped in a Test match. He was of the time belief that any bowling could and should be hit, and gave the impression that the balls were reaching the boundary with a minimum of power. According to Johnnie Moyes, [...] "the sight of his <b>slim</b> <b>figure,</b> neat and trim-looking, always capless, coming to bat brought new hope for spectators. He will never prod a half volley or decline the challenge of a long hop...he will go looking for the ball which he can hit for four." [...] Following the retirement of Sir Donald Bradman, he was seen as Australia's leading batsman, noted by critics for a similar ability to change the mood of matches with his attacking play. Ashley Mallett said that Harvey is Australia's best batsman since Bradman. This was {{despite the fact that he}} was found to have faulty eyesight. With the global expansion of cricket, Harvey was the first Australian to make Test centuries in 15 different cities, succeeding in a variety of conditions. Harvey made 67 first-class centuries spread across 35 venues in six countries. He scored 38 of these overseas, where his average was higher. He was the first batsman to score more than 10,000 runs for Australian teams at home and abroad.|$|E
2500|$|Jaisimha was a {{right-handed}} batsman who {{was noted}} for his style {{on and off}} the field. He bowled medium pace, often opening the bowling for India, and off-breaks, and was a brilliant fielder. But it was the way he went about things that caught the eye. Partab Ramchand wrote after Jaisimha's death that [...] "his <b>slim</b> <b>figure,</b> which he maintained till his last day, the boyish good looks, the inimitable gait, the trademark silk shirt and scarf, the sleeves buttoned at the wrist or the collar turned up â€“ all these attracted immediate attention." [...] Indian Cricket called him a [...] "cultivated stylist".|$|E

6000|$|Yet was not Her Grace justly {{proud of}} the flock of fair maids {{committed}} to her charge? What more charming than these two specimens of austere Queen Mary's dainty maids-of-honour, with their <b>slim</b> <b>figures</b> in the stiff corsets and unwieldy farthingales, their unruly curls held in becomingly by delicate lace coifs, and the sombre panelling of the room throwing up in harmonious contrast the vivid colouring of robes and kerchiefs, of lace and of complexion? ...|$|R

2500|$|Among {{the more}} unusual {{marketing}} promotions {{undertaken by the}} Bile Beans Manufacturing Company was the [...] "Bile Bean March", composed by Charles Fulford's older brother Frank Harris Fulford and first published in 1898. The music was described as [...] "a bold, spirited composition" [...] in a 1902 newspaper report. Readers could apply to receive a free copy of the sheet music by sending their address details to the company. Another marketing ploy was {{the production of a}} cookery book, which was also made widely available free of charge. A Bile Bean Puzzle Book was published during the early 1930s and also freely distributed. By that time advertising for Bile Beans had become increasingly targeted at women, promising them health, bright eyes and a <b>slim</b> <b>figure</b> if taken regularly.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Diet Dreams Come True" [...] episode from November 15, 1988 {{has become}} one of the most talked-about moments in the history of show. After years of {{struggling}} to lose weight, Winfrey had finally succeeded in doing so. In July of that year, she had started the Optifast diet while weighing 212 pounds. By Fall, she weighed 145 pounds. To commemorate achieving her weight loss goals, Winfrey wheeled out a wagon full of fat to represent the 67 pounds she had lost on the diet. She showed off her <b>slim</b> <b>figure</b> in a pair of size 10 Calvin Klein jeans. However, after returning to real food she quickly gained back much of the weight she had lost. Winfrey now refers to that moment as her [...] "ego in a pom pom salute." ...|$|E

25|$|In 2011, Sparks {{attended}} the Muhammad Ali Celebrity Fight Night showcasing a noticeably <b>slimmer</b> <b>figure.</b> At the time Sparks admitted {{she had lost}} 30 pounds. Sparks eventually lost roughly 50 pounds, weighing in at 155 to 161 pounds which she revealed on the Today Show in 2014. Sparks revealed she had fallen ill in December 2010 with walking pneumonia, after her stint on Broadway. This was the motivation for Sparks to begin to change her lifestyle {{which resulted in a}} weight loss.|$|R
60|$|For {{some moments}} he half regretted {{that it was}} not the more developed, richer-coloured girl with the bronzed tresses who had aspired to join his staff. Then he shook his head: that {{exquisite}} brown tint would not last for ever in the shade, and the bearing was also just a shade too proud. He considered the other, with the <b>slimmer</b> <b>figure,</b> the far more delicate skin, the more eloquent eyes, and he concluded that he had got the best of the pair.|$|R

50|$|The {{panel on}} the 17th-century altar {{is the work of}} Antonius Clement, Queen Sophia's court painter. Its three niches have female figures {{representing}} Faith, Hope and Charity and are bordered by <b>slim</b> <b>figures</b> representing the cardinal virtues: Temperance, Justice, Prudence and Fortitude. The elaborately worked Renaissance altarpiece (1616) contains a painting of the Last Supper. The carved baroque pulpit (1633) by JÃ¸rgen Ringnis with paintings by Anthonius Clement bears similarities to the one in Kippinge Church. The Romanesque font has a wide, rounded bowl.|$|R
40|$|Preferred body sizes {{appear to}} {{decrease}} markedly with increasing exposure to contemporÃ¤ry notions of slimness and economic modernity, and reduce even further in industrial settings as socio-economic status increases. Recently a study examining physical attractiveness preferences in Britain and Malaysia, shows that preference for slim ideals {{varies according to}} socio-economic status. Malaysians in Britain and Kuala Lumpur preferred slimmer female bodies than observers in semi-urban Kota Kinabalu, who in turn preferred <b>slimmer</b> <b>figures</b> than rural observers in East Malaysia. This study {{has important implications for}} the study of body image and eating disorders in Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} was to examine the effect of body exposure on the evaluation of body image through emotionally coloured words in Muslims girls with and without hijab. The sample consisted of 60 female students divided into two groups. The sorting criterion was the way of dressing. The first group consisted of respondents who wear traditional Muslim clothing, hijab, while the second group of participants (also Muslim) were uncovered. In order {{to determine the effects of}} the experimental procedure, affective priming paradigm was applied. Two factors with two levels were included: PRIME (the photographs of slender and obese female figures) and TARGET (positive and negative words). Besides the experimental procedure, a General Questionnaire and the Body Satisfaction Questionnaire (BSQ) were administered. The results have shown a statistically significant interaction PRIME x TARGET (F= 14. 189; p<. 001), but no significant effects of emotional valence of the prime or targets. The uncovered respondents significantly faster assessed the type of word after photographs of <b>slim</b> <b>figures</b> than after those of the obese. The results can be considered as an indicator of positive implicit attitudes of uncovered students towards this kind of visual material (<b>slim</b> <b>figures),</b> i. e. they indicate the acceptance and positive attitude towards media messages that promote the thin body shape as the ideal of beauty and attractiveness...|$|R
