25|$|Cold water kits {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the risk of {{freezing}} inside the regulator. Some regulators come with this as standard, and some others can be retrofitted. Environmental sealing of the diaphragm main spring chamber using a soft secondary diaphragm and hydrostatic transmitter or a silicone, alcohol or glycol/water mixture antifreeze liquid in the sealed spring compartment can be used for a diaphragm regulator. Silicone grease in the spring chamber can be used on a piston first stage. The Poseidon Xstream first stage insulates the external spring and <b>spring</b> <b>housing</b> from the rest of the regulator, so that it is less chilled by the expanding air, and provides large slots in the housing so that the spring can be warmed by the water, thus avoiding the problem of freezing up the external spring.|$|E
50|$|Mannlicher {{designed}} two semi-automatic rifles both called Model 93, {{one based}} on his turn-bolt rifle and the other based on his straight-pull rifle. The rifles had a recoil <b>spring</b> <b>housing</b> behind the bolt and the bolt locking lugs were angled, so the bolt started turning on firing, essentially a hesitation lock or delayed blowback much like the later Thompson Autorifle utilising the Blish lock. In this system there was no recoiling barrel nor gas piston as with other rifle-caliber autoloading designs, so the mechanism was simple, but ejection of fired cartridge casings was so fierce as to be hazardous to bystanders.|$|E
50|$|The {{recuperator}} spring {{problem was}} rectified {{with the new}} Mk II carriage officially introduced {{in the field in}} November 1916 with a hydro-pneumatic recuperator design which replaced the recuperator springs with a system driven by air compression and could be fitted into the existing <b>spring</b> <b>housing</b> by battery officers in the field. It is identified by the 10 in torpedo-shaped extension on the recuperator, which made the recuperator assembly nearly as long as the barrel and hence altered the equipment profile. Converted existing carriages were designated Mk I*. The Mk II carriage also incorporated a longer cradle.|$|E
5000|$|The Otter <b>Spring</b> <b>House</b> is a {{historic}} <b>spring</b> <b>house</b> in the Town of Lincoln in Forest County, Wisconsin. The <b>spring</b> <b>house</b> was built on Otter Spring in 1933 as a Civilian Conservation Corps project; it was originally built to supply water to the CCC's Waubikon Lake Camp but was insufficient for that purpose. Since its construction, the Potawatomi have used the <b>spring</b> <b>house</b> for ceremonial and religious purposes. Potawatomi ritual feasts must use spring water, as springs are considered [...] "living waters"; when taking water from the spring, the Potawatomi offer a thanksgiving prayer and a tobacco offering. The <b>spring</b> <b>house</b> {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places on June 3, 1999.|$|R

5000|$|There was {{a health}} spa named the Chalybeate Spa in Hove {{featuring}} the St. Ann's Well spring operating {{as early as}} the 18th century. At that time, the spring had considerably greater flow than it does at present.In the 1760s, the Scutts made a number of improvements associated with the spring.Around 1800 an elaborate [...] "pump room" [...] was built over the <b>spring,</b> <b>housing</b> assorted facilities and accommodating the large numbers who came seeking therapeutic relief at that time. At the pumphouse {{at the top of the}} hill in the park, people could drink the brown waters of the spring (at some times of the year, the waters are closer to yellow).|$|E
50|$|The Ballester-Molina was {{predominantly}} used by Argentina's security forces. The Argentine Army adopted this {{weapon in}} 1938. The Ballester-Molina {{is a short}} recoil-operated semi-automatic locked breech pistol. The locking system is a near identical copy of the Colt M1911A1, with the swinging lock used to unlock the barrel from the slide. The trigger is single action, two stage, but pivots rather than slides like the 1911 trigger. The <b>spring</b> <b>housing</b> system is integrated to the pistol frame rather than being a separate part. The hammer is locked by the frame-mounted manual safety, and most notably there is no grip safety. Overall quality is excellent. Many examples for sale on the surplus market have seen heavy use but show little internal wear.|$|E

The Eastern Metropolitan Bypass lies on the east, Beleghata/Tangra/Sealdah on the west, China Town on the south and the Metropolitan Cooperative Housing Society on the north. The closest {{landmarks}} near Dhapa are the ITC Sonar hotel & Silver <b>Spring</b> <b>housing</b> which fall on the east side, Milan Mela ground or the permanent trade fair ground which is on the south side and Mathpukur five point crossing which is on the west side. In the West side of Dhapa an oldest and important landmark exist which is the Awatar Bhavan that has Dhapa Post Office in it. It also has the St. Thomas school. This building was once built by Late Yadunandan Singh in the year 1920 and is currently owned by his son Shatrughna Prasad Singh. Apart from that some other old landmarks are Dhapa Kutchery also built by Late Yadunandan Singh in 1920's.|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to study the effect of roll and protuberances on the aerodynamic characteristics of ASLV in the Mach Number range of 0. 4 to 4. 0 and incidence range - 6 to 6 degrees. Study included the effects of <b>spring</b> <b>housing</b> and absence of boosters from the Core Vehicle. Results of the study showed significant effect of protuberances on the aerodynamic derivatives and variation of rolling moment with the roll.

40|$|In some implementations, {{apparatus}} and methods are provided through which a dynamic cryogenic seal is manufactured. In some implementations, the seal includes a retainer and a spring-seal assembly, the assembly being comprised of a main <b>spring</b> <b>housing</b> and fluorine-containing polymer seals. In some implementations, either a radial seal, or an axial (or "piston seal") is provided. In some implementations, methods of manufacturing the dynamic cryogenic seal are also provided. In some implementations, the methods include assembling the components while either heated or cooled, {{taking advantage of}} thermal expansion and contraction, such {{that there is a}} strong interference fit between the components at room temperature. In some implementations, this process ensures that the weaker fluorine-containing polymer seal is forced to expand and contract with the stronger retainer and spring and is under constant preload. In some implementations, the fluorine-containing polymer is therefore fluidized and retained, and can not lift off...|$|E

40|$|Wind tunnel {{studies were}} carried out to obtain {{pressure}} distribution in the strap-on booster interference region of 1 / 20 th scale Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle model configuration. Tests were done in the 1. 2 m tunnel at NAL in the Mach number range of 0. 5 to 2. 5 for the clean configuration as well as with <b>spring</b> <b>housing</b> attachments on the strap-on boosters. Both the model configurations with the boosters strapped on to the core vehicle in the horizontal plane (pitch) and in the vertical plane (yaw) were tested for incidences at 0, 4 and - 4 deg. In addition pressure measurements were also done on the core vehicle alone at Mach numbers 2. 1, 2. 5 and 3. 0 for 0, + 4 degree incidences. The test Reynolds number was varied from 0. 7 to 1. 3 millions based on the maximum diameter of the model. The pressure distribution showed significant interference effects of boosters on the core vehicle. It is observed that the positive pressure peak associated with flow compression at the flare junction increases with increase in Mach number. In the pitch plane the normal force distribution remains positive along the core vehicle whereas in the yaw plane it is of less magnitude...|$|E
