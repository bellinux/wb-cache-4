The Appalachia Cancer Network undertook a qualitative research study to help determine whether <b>Screen</b> <b>for</b> Life materials are being used and distributed by organizations serving Appalachian residents and to help assess key informants’ perceived acceptability of the materials. Methods Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 13 state and local informants in three Appalachian states to assess the diversity of community organizations that received the materials, the level of material use, and receptivity to <b>Screen</b> <b>for</b> Life. Results Regional cancer control programs were more active in promoting <b>Screen</b> <b>for</b> Life at local levels than state health departments.

40|$|Abstract Background Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) is a {{human rights}} violation that is pervasive worldwide, and is particularly critical for women during the reproductive period. IPV includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Nurses on in-patient postpartum units are well-positioned to <b>screen</b> women <b>for</b> IPV, yet low screening rates suggest that barriers to screening exist. The {{purpose of this study}} was to (a) identify the frequency of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> IPV, (b) the most important barriers to screening, (c) the relationship between the barriers to screening and the frequency of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> types of abuse, and (d) to identify other factors that contribute to the frequency of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> IPV. Methods In 2008, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 96 nurses from postpartum inpatient units in three Canadian urban hospitals. The survey included the Barriers to Abuse Assessment Tool (BAAT), adapted for postpartum nurses (PPN). Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models were used to predict barriers to <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> each type of IPV. Results The frequency of screening varied by the type of abuse with highest <b>screening</b> rates found <b>for</b> physical and emotional abuse. According to the BAAT-PPN, lack of knowledge was the most important barrier to screening. The BAAT-PPN total score was negatively correlated with <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Using OLS regression models and after controlling for demographic characteristics, the BAAT-PPN explained 14 %, 12 %, and 11 % of the variance in <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> physical, sexual and emotional abuse, respectively. Fluency in the language of the patient was negatively correlated with <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> each type of abuse. When added as Step 3 to OLS regression models, language fluency was associated with an additional decrease in the likelihood of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> physical (beta coefficient = -. 38, P P =. 05), and emotional abuse (beta coefficient = -. 48, P Conclusions Our findings support an inverse relationship between rates of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> IPV and nurses' perceptions of barriers. Barriers to <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> IPV, particularly related to knowledge and language fluency, need to be addressed to increase rates of screening on postpartum units. </p...|$|R
