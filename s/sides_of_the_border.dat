5|$|Mexican Marines arrested Treviño Morales on 15 July 2013 in {{the state}} of Nuevo León without a single bullet being fired. At the time of his capture, the Mexican {{government}} was offering up to a 30 million pesos (US$2.3 million) reward for information leading to his arrest. The United States Department of State was offering up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and conviction. Authorities on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> believe that he was succeeded by his younger brother Omar Treviño Morales, a man who was also on the most-wanted list.|$|E

5|$|About 18 percent (40,000) of the Uruguayan {{population}} (220,000) spoke Portuguese {{and regarded}} themselves as Brazilian rather than Uruguayan. Many within Flores' ranks were Brazilians, some hailing {{from the nearby}} Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul. Life along the frontier between Rio Grande do Sul and Uruguay was often chaotic, with hostilities erupting between partisans of various cattle barons, cattle-rustling and random killings. Large landowners on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> had long been antagonistic toward Berro's policies. The Uruguayan president attempted to tax the cattle coming from Rio Grande do Sul and to impose curbs {{on the use of}} Brazilian slaves within Uruguayan territory; slavery had been outlawed years before in Uruguay.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of {{the twelve}} USAF {{personnel}} lost {{on the day of}} the battle were listed first as missing in action (MIA), then later as KIA/body not recovered.

The U.N. observer team, which would be set up by the former UN Congo commander, Swedish Major General Carl von Horn.

California's Interstate 8 developed cracks in it, but vehicles were still able to traverse the highway. The CaliforniaHighwayPatrol warned drivers that use of the road would be at their own risk.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Vukovar {{took place}} in two phases over about 90 days: from August to September 1991, before the town was fully surrounded, and from early October to mid-November, when the town was encircled then taken by the JNA. From June, the Serb forces {{subjected}} Vukovar and neighbouring villages to daily or near-daily artillery and mortar fire. During July the JNA and TO began deploying in large numbers across eastern Slavonia, surrounding Vukovar on three sides. Heavy fighting began {{at the end of}} August. On 23 August Borovo Naselje came under heavy shellfire. Croatian forces shot down two Yugoslav G-2 Galeb fighter aircraft using shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles. The following day, the JNA, the Yugoslav Air Force and the Yugoslav Navy launched a major attack using aircraft, naval vessels on the Danube, tanks and artillery. The attack, which was mounted from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> caused extensive damage and many civilian casualties.|$|E
5|$|Tower {{houses were}} a common feature of British and Irish castle {{building}} in the late medieval period: over 3,000 were constructed in Ireland, around 800 in Scotland and over 250 in England. A tower house would typically be a tall, square, stone-built, crenelated building; Scottish and Ulster tower houses were often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn, a walled courtyard designed to hold valuable animals securely, but not necessarily intended for serious defence. Many of the gateways in these buildings were guarded with yetts, grill-like doors made out of metal bars. Smaller versions of tower houses in northern England and southern Scotland were known as Peel towers, or pele houses, and were built along both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> regions. In Scotland a number were built in Scottish towns. It was originally argued that Irish tower houses {{were based on the}} Scottish design, but the pattern of development of such castles in Ireland does not support this hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|As {{a leader}} of the resistance, Thảo was {{allocated}} the responsibility of indoctrinating the 1947 batch of recruits with Vietminh ideology. One of Thảo's students was his future enemy, South Vietnamese General and President Nguyễn Khánh. This group became the 410th Battalion and went on to fight near Cà Mau, the southernmost part of Vietnam. By 1949, Thảo {{was in charge of the}} Vietminh espionage apparatus around Saigon and organised the guerrilla companies in the countryside. Thảo was also involved in procuring arms. Filipino traders brought arms into southern Vietnam in return for rice, shrimp, pork, gold and banknotes. Following the French defeat in 1954 at Điện Biên Phủ, Thảo helped evacuate communist fighters from South Vietnam and Cambodia in accordance with the terms of the Geneva Conference. Under these Accords, Vietnam was to be temporarily divided at the 17th parallel pending national elections to reunify the country in 1956, and military personnel were to be evacuated to their respective <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> In the meantime, Hồ Chí Minh's Vietminh controlled the north under the DRV while the south was under the French-sponsored State of Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio Díaz {{planned a}} summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, an {{historic}} first meeting between a U.S. {{president and a}} Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico. But tensions rose on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Burnham {{was put in charge}} of a 250 private security detail hired by Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured and disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and Díaz.|$|E
5|$|The SASR {{first saw}} action in 1965 {{as part of}} the British Commonwealth force {{stationed}} in north Borneo during the Indonesian Confrontation. The SASR troopers operated alongside their British and New Zealand counterparts in operations aimed at stopping Indonesian infiltration into Malaysia, taking part in Operation Claret. 1 Squadron conducted reconnaissance patrols in Sarawak from February to July 1965, and cross-border operations between May and July. They suffered their first fatality on 2 June when a soldier was gored by an elephant. 1 Squadron completed operations on 1 August and returned to Australia. 2 Squadron arrived in Borneo in January 1966 for a four-month deployment, and despite the suspension of Claret operations it also conducted reconnaissance patrols and cross-border operations, undertaking a total of 45 patrols on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> On 19 March two soldiers drowned during a river crossing. On 21 July, 2 Squadron was relieved by a British SAS squadron and returned to Australia in August. Despite often being deployed in the reconnaissance role, the SASR killed at least 20 Indonesian soldiers in a series of ambushes and contacts. Three SASR soldiers were killed. These operations mostly occurred in secret, and were never admitted during the war.|$|E

There were many large rivers on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> and these were the main means of movement, including hovercraft by the UK. There were also quite a few small grass airstrips suitable for light aircraft, as dropping zones for parachuted supplies, and for helicopters.|$|E
