The government adopted a strategy of contesting every claim until a 1997 Supreme Court decision. After this, the Law Society of Ireland facilitated negotiations between the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Department of Defence on the one hand, and the main solicitors' firms representing claimants on the other, {{which led to a}} <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> court <b>proceedings</b> while a Department of Health expert group developed a standardised metric for assessing hearing loss. This group's 1998 [...] "Green Book" [...] report informed the Civil Liability (Assessment of Hearing Injury) Act, 1998. Subsequently, the Supreme Court advised the government to assign standardised rates of compensation for the various levels of hearing loss. It also awarded compensation based on predicted future loss of hearing additional to normal age-related hearing loss; opponents criticised this as impossible to quantify. In December 1999, the Supreme Court accepted the government's formula of IR£750 per degree of deafness attained at age 60. This was the basis for the Early Settlement Scheme used for most claims. The average claim payout fell from €30,000 before the adoption of the guidelines to €10,700 in 2002, €8,900 in 2003, and €5,700 in 2004.|$|R

50|$|Before the {{registration}} of insolvency, Wesseler already {{tried to change}} {{the concept of the}} company in late 1965. Paul Wesseler wanted to stop the tractor production and form Wesseler into a Fiat dealer. This happened in 1967 when Wesseler became the H. Wesseler KG. The company soon became important for the region again as a Fiat dealer, a new tractor workshop was built in 1973 and expanded in 1982. Wesseler was the second-largest Fiat dealer in Germany. At the end of the 1980s, Wesseler had to face major problems: A huge and expensive spares store and too many employees. In February 1988 Wesseler had to register als insolvent again. So far, 2000 Fiat tractors had been sold. After the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> the insolvency <b>proceedings,</b> a newly founded agricultural machine company rented the Wesseler plant in 1995.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a right of a third party to prevent {{enforcement}} {{on the basis of}} a claim and evidence that rights or assets seized in enforcement proceeding belong to him (third party) and not to the enforcement debtor. In most of jurisdictions that were subject of analysis of this paper, this right of a third party is exercised by filing an objection to the court conducting enforcement <b>proceedings.</b> The claim <b>of</b> the third party is directed towards the enforcement creditor as well as against the enforcement debtor. In the event the claim of the third party is being contested, the court instructs the third party to initiate litigation proceedings for determining whether the third party is entitled to exclusion of such rights or assets from enforcement, especially if such third party holds property rights or some other rights over the assets that are being subject to enforcement <b>proceedings.</b> In majority <b>of</b> analyzed jurisdictions, enforcement proceedings are being suspended provided the third party, in the objection being filed makes prima facie likely, on the basis of credible evidence, that his assets were seized in the enforcement proceedings. However, according to the law of the Republic of Serbia, a credible objection of a third party does not result in <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> enforcement <b>proceedings,</b> something that is being criticized in this paper. As a result of this provision of the law, a bona fide third party is forced to endure the enforcement although his claim has been made likely and subsequently confirmed in the litigation proceedings. The author, in particular, points to the legal consequences of mala fide enforcement creditor that knew that the assets that are being subject <b>of</b> the enforcement <b>proceedings</b> do not belong to the enforcement debtor. The author is of the opinion that, in such cases, the enforcement creditor should be obliged to pay to the third party damages that such party suffered as a result <b>of</b> enforcement <b>proceedings</b> being instigated against his assets...|$|R

40|$|Arguably, {{eliminating}} <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments [...] {{periods when}} banks jointly refuse to convert their liabilities into outside money or other assets [...] {{was an important}} impetus for creating the Federal Reserve. Friedman and Schwartz suggest that a suspension in 1930 would have decreased {{the severity of the}} Great Depression. More recently, an emerging literature suggests that <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments may well be optimal in some states of the world. We present evidence about <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments from an episode that is close to a controlled experiment for examining their effects. In 1861, about 44 percent of the banks in Wisconsin closed, 81 percent of the banks in Illinois closed, and noteholders suffered substantial losses. The historical record suggests a possible explanation: an effective <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments in Wisconsin but not Illinois. Historical and statistical evidence indicate that the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments decreased the number of banks that closed as well as noteholders' losses. Our statistical evidence indicates a 25 percent increase in the probability that an average bank in the two states remains open with the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments. The <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments decreases noteholders' losses by about 20 cents per dollar of notes. Bank failures; Banks and banking - History; Banks and banking, Central...|$|R

40|$|Article 27 - 2 of the Penal Code in Japan {{requires}} that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> {{execution of the}} sentence' should be judged in view of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing re-offending'. Some, on the other hand, argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be "balanced" with the criminal responsibility of the offender, which is {{greater than that of}} those whose execution of the sentence is fully suspended and is smaller than that of those whose sentence is partially executed. However, I think that this method of judgment ignores the requirements of Article 27 - 2, simply imposing the `penalty' in the community, which has no desirable effect on the offender's rehabilitation. Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility. In this paper, I reconsider the discussion on `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' and `full <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' in order to clarify the image of those whose sentence is `partially suspended' under Article 27 - 2. Through this process, I argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be determined with sufficient consideration of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing reoffending...|$|R
