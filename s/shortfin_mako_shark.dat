5|$|Some teleosts are parasites. Remoras {{have their}} front dorsal fins {{modified}} into large suckers {{with which they}} cling onto a host animal such as a whale, sea turtle, shark or ray, but this is probably a commensal rather than parasitic arrangement because both remora and host benefit from the removal of ectoparasites and loose flakes of skin. More harmful are the catfish that enter the gill chambers of fish and feed on their blood and tissues. The snubnosed eel, though usually a scavenger, sometimes bores into the flesh of a fish, and has been found inside {{the heart of a}} <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>sharks,</b> as {{with most}} other sharks, are aged by {{sectioning}} vertebrae — {{one of the few}} bony structures in sharks — and counting growth bands. The age of <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako,</b> and therefore important parameters, such as age at sexual maturity and longevity, were severely underestimated until 2006 (e.g. claims of sexual maturity at 4-6 years, claims of longevity as low as 11 years), because of a poorly supported belief that <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> deposited two growth bands per year in their vertebrae. This belief was overturned by a landmark study which proved that <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> only deposit one band in their vertebrae per year, as well as providing validated ages for numerous specimens.

50|$|<b>Shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> consume 3% {{of their}} weight {{each day and}} take about 1.5-2.0 days to digest an average-sized meal. By comparison, the sandbar shark, an {{inactive}} species, consumes 0.6% of its weight a day and takes 3 to 4 days to digest it. An analysis of the stomach contents of 399 male and female <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> ranging from 67 - 328 cm suggest makos from Cape Hatteras to the Grand Banks prefer bluefish, constituting 77.5% of their diet by volume. The average capacity of the stomach was 10% of the total weight. <b>Shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> consumed 4.3% to 14.5% of the available bluefish between Cape Hatteras and Georges Bank.|$|R

500|$|The {{longfin mako}} shark (Isurus paucus) is {{a species of}} {{mackerel}} shark in the family Lamnidae, with a probable worldwide distribution in temperate and tropical waters. An uncommon species, it is typically lumped together under the name [...] "mako" [...] with its better-known relative, the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> (I. oxyrinchus). The longfin mako is a pelagic species found in moderately deep water, having been reported {{to a depth of}} [...] Growing to a maximum length of , the slimmer build and long, broad pectoral fins of this shark suggest that it is a slower and less active swimmer than the shortfin mako.|$|E
500|$|Most {{sharks are}} [...] "cold-blooded" [...] or, more precisely, poikilothermic, meaning that their {{internal}} body temperature matches {{that of their}} ambient environment. Members of the family Lamnidae (such as the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> and the great white shark) are homeothermic and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. In these sharks, a strip of aerobic red muscle located {{near the center of}} the body generates the heat, which the body retains via a countercurrent exchange mechanism by a system of blood vessels called the rete mirabile ("miraculous net"). The common thresher shark has a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature, which is thought to have evolved independently.|$|E
500|$|Common {{threshers}} {{are well}} regarded by sports fishers {{as one of}} the strongest fighting sharks alongside the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> (Isurus oxyrhinchus), and are ranked as game fish by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA). They are pursued by anglers using rod and reel off California, South Africa, and elsewhere. Frank Mundus has called thresher sharks [...] "exceedingly stubborn" [...] and [...] "pound for pound, a harder fish to whip" [...] than the mako. Fishing for the common thresher is similar to that for the mako; the recommended equipment is a [...] rod and a big-game reel holding at least 365 m (400 yd) of [...] line. The ideal method is trolling with baitfish, either deep or allowing it to drift.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> travel long {{distances}} to seek prey or mates. In December 1998, a female tagged off California {{was captured in}} the central Pacific by a Japanese research vessel, meaning this fish traveled over 1725 mi. Another specimen swam 1322 mi in 37 days, averaging 36 mi a day.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> over 3 m have {{interior}} teeth considerably {{wider and}} flatter than smaller makos, which {{enables them to}} prey effectively upon dolphins, swordfish, and other sharks. An amateur videotape, taken in Pacific waters, shows a moribund pantropical spotted dolphin whose tail was almost completely severed being circled by a <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako.</b> Makos also tend to scavenge long-lined and netted fish.Its endothermic constitution partly accounts for its relatively great speed.|$|R
50|$|Due to this error, fishery {{management}} models and ecological risk assessment models in use {{around the world}} were underestimating both the longevity and the age at sexual maturity in <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>sharks,</b> particularly in females, by two-thirds or more (i.e. 6 years versus 18+ years), {{and some of these}} inaccurate models remain in use.|$|R

A number of juveniles, 6 out of 96 individuals with non-empty stomachs, had consumed marine mammals. The remains (skin, fat, vertebrae and flesh with the dorsal fin) were not identifiable at species level by non-genetic methods. Portions of themitochondrial DNA control region and of the gene coding for cytochrome b were therefore sequenced. Both the short-beaked common dolphin Delphinus delphis and possibly the striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba were identified. <b>Shortfin</b> <b>makos</b> are able to consume marine mammals almost as large as themselves.

40|$|The {{biology and}} catch history {{of members of}} 3 shark {{families}} (Carcharhinidae, Lamnidae and Sphyrnidae) were examined in this study. These investigations involved examining sharks landed by recreational fishing and protective beach meshing {{off the coast of}} New South Wales (NSW). The historical catch records were examined from these fisheries as well as from commercial fishing. Genetic techniques were successfully used to develop a DNA fingerprint database and complemented morphological methods in identifying whaler sharks Carcharhinus spp. to species level. This had not been previously undertaken in official catch records for protective beach meshing nor recreational gamefishing since their inception in NSW Stomach content analysis was undertaken on the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier caught off NSW and indicated that the species is a non-selective predator, with birds being a major prey item during the study. The first age and growth study of tiger and <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> in Australia was undertaken. Analysis of vertebral growth ring counts indicated no difference in the age and growth rates of G. cuvier between females and males, with the oldest tiger shark sampled being 21 years old. Age and growth differences were observed between the genders in <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> lsurus oxvrinchus, with the oldest male sampled being 7 years old and oldest female sampled being 10 years old. The first-ever comparative assessment was undertaken on the long term catches of major pelagic shark species caught by the various fisheries operating off NSW Noticeable declines in the number of sharks landed by recreational gamejishing have been offset by the larger number of sharks being tagged and released. Examination of data from recaptured tagged sharks indicate large scale movements of blue sharks Prionace glauca and <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> around the Southwestern Pacific Ocean. When catches from all fisheries are examined, an increase in the total relative abundance of sharks off NSW is evident.

50|$|The <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> (Isurus oxyrinchus), {{also known}} as the blue pointer or bonito shark, is a large {{mackerel}} shark. It is commonly referred to as the mako shark, as is the longfin mako shark (Isurus paucus). The shortfin mako is on record as the fastest-swimming shark, capable of bursts of speed up to 18.8 m/s.|$|E
50|$|The <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> is {{cylindrical}} in shape, with a vertically elongated tail. This species exhibits countershading, with brilliant metallic blue coloration dorsally {{and white}} ventrally. The {{line of demarcation}} between blue and white on the body is distinct. The underside of the snout and {{the area around the}} mouth are white. Larger specimens tend to possess darker coloration that extends onto parts of the body that would be white in smaller individuals. The juvenile mako differs in that it has a clear blackish stain on the tip of the snout. The longfin mako shark very much resembles the <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>shark,</b> but has larger pectoral fins, dark rather than pale coloration around the mouth and larger eyes. The presence of only one lateral keel on the tail and the lack of lateral cusps on the teeth distinguish the makos from the closely related porbeagle sharks of the genus Lamna.|$|E

50|$|ISAF {{statistics}} records 9 shortfin {{attacks on}} humans between 1580 and 2017, {{one of which}} was fatal, along with 20 boat attacks. This mako is regularly blamed for attacks on humans and, due to its speed, power, and size, it is certainly capable of injuring and killing people. However, this species will not generally attack humans and does not seem to treat them as prey. Most modern attacks involving <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>sharks</b> are considered to have been provoked due to harassment or the shark being caught on a fishing line. Sharks can be attracted to spear fishermen carrying a stuck fish, and may slap them with cavitation bubbles from a swift tail flick.

The largest <b>shortfin</b> <b>mako</b> <b>shark</b> taken on hook-and-line was 600 kg, caught {{off the coast of}} California on June 3, 2013. Larger specimens are known, with a few large, mature females exceeding a length of 3.8 m and a weight of 570 kg. The longest verified length for a Shortfin Mako, caught off of the coast of France in September 1973, was 4.45 m. A specimen caught off the coast of Italy and examined in an Italian fish market in 1881 was reported to weigh an extraordinary 1000 kg at a length of 4 m.

Killer whales can induce tonic immobility in {{sharks and rays}} by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe. In one incident filmed near the Farallon Islands in October 1997, a [...] female killed a [...] great white shark, apparently after swimming with it upside-down in her mouth and inducing tonic immobility in it. She and another pod member ate the shark's liver and allowed the rest of the carcass to sink. In February 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a white shark off South Australia. Interspecific competition between the two species is probable in regions where dietary preferences overlap. Killer whales have also been recorded hunting tiger sharks. In July 1992, two killer whales attacked, killed and fed on an [...] long whale shark, Rhincodon typus, in the waters off Bahia de los Angeles in Baja California.|$|R
