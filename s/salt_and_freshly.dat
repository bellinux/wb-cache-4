5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> mined salt (much {{of which is}} sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Who {{would think}} of cooking a potato in boiling rosin? The origin and {{rationale}} for this interesting cooking behavior is lost in ethno-botanical lore but directions for the practice persisted until recent editions of The Joy of Cooking (Rombauer and Becker 1975). Indeed, the dish can still be obtained at Sweetie Pies Restaurant (Decatur, TX) one day a week. We obtained rosin (Pinerez 1277), produced by Hexion Specialty Chemicals, to duplicate the cooking recipe and to investigate the gustatory effects. The basic recipe involves heating the rosin to 275 0 F and carefully lowering the spud into the pot (see Figure 1). The potato initially sinks in the rosin, but after about 45 minutes, floats to the surface (Rombauer and Becker 1975). The potato is simmered a further 30 minutes, removed from the rosin, and wrapped in heavy brown paper with the ends twisted tightly. The rosin baked potato is cooled for 10 minutes and then slit and served with butter, <b>salt,</b> <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> ground pepper. The cooking process must be done outside and the skin must not be eaten. The cooking in rosin provides a baked potato with an exceptional texture that is distinctively flaky. Figure 1.

40|$|The SiO 2 :Fe lms on Si {{substrates}} {{were produced}} by solgel and spinning techniques. Hybrid organicinorganic precursor (tetraethoxysilaneFeCl 3) and organic alkoxide precursor modied from Fe acetate were used. The Fe nanoparticles {{have been formed}} by various technological procedures. The structural, magnetic and optical characteristics of (SiO 2 :Fe) / Si samples depending on technology of sample preparation were examined. The size of Fe nanoparticles was shown {{to be controlled by}} precursor preparation procedure. It was found that Fe-containing nanocrystals of average size » 40 nm were formed by one-pot technique from the mixture of solutions containing Fe <b>salts</b> <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> prepared colloidal tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). In contrast, in the two-pots procedure, the components of precursor were prepared non-simultaneously and the structurized TEOS sol was used. In the latter case, Fe nanoparticles were distributed in size over a larger range with a mean value at » 25 nm. It was hence concluded that precursor-controlled formation of Fe nanoparticles can be achieved using different solgel technological procedures...|$|R
40|$|Factors {{affecting}} natural {{transformation of}} Acinetobacter calcoaceticus BD 413 with homologous chromosomal DNA in a silt loam soil microcosm were investigated. Inducible transformation of declining populations of noncompetent A. calcoaceticus cells was detectable {{for up to}} 6 days when a simple carbon source, <b>salts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> added DNA were used. In two different experimental setups, the residence time in soil of induced cells could be increased to either 11 or 24 h before DNA addition without reduced transformation frequency; 200 -to 1, 000 -fold fewer transformants were observed following the addition of water. These observations suggest that A. calcoaceticus remains transformable for several hours after its activation by nutrients in soil. Increasing the levels of phosphate salts significantly enhanced the numbers of transformants without increasing the recipient counts correspondingly. Variable levels of ammonium or divalent cations (Mg(sup 2 +) and Ca(sup 2 +)) {{did not have a}} similar major influence. Soil moisture content significantly affected the transformation frequency of A. calcoaceticus cells, with a general tendency of higher frequencies in drier soil. A minimal frequency was observed at around 35 % soil moisture. The data indicate that A. calcoaceticus cells in soil which cannot be detectably transformed are easily induced by nutrients to undergo natural transformation with chromosomal DNA. Access to nutrients seems to be critical for the development and maintenance of competence in soil, which is also affected by abiotic factors like moisture level <b>and</b> phosphate <b>salt</b> concentration...|$|R
