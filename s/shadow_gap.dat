The electron band developing the SC order parameter Δ_e but having no FS displays a <b>shadow</b> <b>gap</b> feature which will be easily detected by various experimental probes such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Finally, the formation of the nodal gap Δ_nodal with A_ 1 g symmetry on the other hole pocket with a larger FS is stabilized due to the balance of the interband pairing interactions from the main hole band gap Δ_h=+Δ and the hidden electron band gap Δ_e = -Δ.

40|$|We {{show that}} hole-doped cuprates can harbor Fermi-surface-free {{superconductivity}} {{similar to the}} case of the pnictides. This occurs near the doping at which a new Fermi surface pocket appears in the antinodal region. The change in Fermi surface topology is accompanied by a characteristic rise in spectral weight. Our results support the presence of a trisected superconducting dome, and suggest that superconductivity is responsible for stabilizing the (pi, pi) magnetic order. Recent ARPES studies on pnictides adduce that the superconducting transition temperature Tc depends sensitively on details of the band structure and Fermi surface (FS) 1. In particular, proximity of the FS to a band edge and the as-sociated Van Hove singularity (VHS) correlates with significantly enhanced Tc’s. An investigation of Ba 1 −xKxFe 2 As 22 indicates that when a band edge approaches the FS, superconductivity can be observed even before the band crosses the FS. Bang 2 suggests that this FS-free superconductivity is driven by the shadow bands resulting from the sym-metrization of spectral weight around the Fermi energy and the formation of a related <b>shadow</b> <b>gap</b> in the BCS theory. We show how this remarkable effect can also arise in the single-band case of the cuprates when the band is split by magnetic order. In the electron doped system {{it is well known that}} the (pi, pi) antiferromagnetic (AF) order can induce two distinct topological transitions (TT’s) with doping 3, 4. At half-filling, the AF order splits the band into upper and lowe...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Coupling of the {{localized}} surface plasmons {{between two}} closely apposed gold nanoparticles (nano-antenna) can cause strong enhancements of fluorescence or Raman signal intensity from molecules in the plasmonic “hot-spot”. Harnessing these properties for practical applications is challenging {{due to the}} need to fabricate gold particle arrays with well-defined nanometer spacing and a means of delivering functional molecules to the hot-spot. We report fabrication of billions of plasmon-coupled nanostructures on a single substrate by a combination of colloid lithography and plasma processing. Controlled spacing of the nanoantenna gaps is achieved by taking advantage of the fact that polystyrene particles melt together at their contact point during plasma processing. The resulting polymer thread <b>shadows</b> a <b>gap</b> of well-defined spacing between each pair of gold triangles in the final array. Confocal surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy imaging confirms the array is functionally uniform. Furthermore, a fully intact supported membrane can be formed on the intervening substrate by vesicle fusion. Trajectories of freely diffusing individual proteins are traced as they sequentially pass through, and are enhanced by, multiple gaps. The nanoantenna array thus enables enhanced observation of a fluid membrane system without static entrapment of the molecules...|$|R
40|$|We {{observe a}} {{significant}} change in the TW Hya disk interior to 40 AU via archival unpolarized multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope/STIS and NICMOS images with an inner working angle (IWA) of 04 (22 AU). Our images show the outer edge of a clearing at every wavelength with similar behavior, demonstrating that the feature is structural, rather than due to some property of polarized light in the disk. We compare our observations to those taken by Akiyama et al. (2015) and Rapson et al. (2015), and discuss the spectral evolution of the disk interior to 80 AU. We construct a model with two gaps: one at 30 AU and one at 80 AU that fit the observed surface brightness profile but overpredicts the absolute brightness of the disk. Our models require an additional dimming to be consistent with observations, which we tentatively ascribe to <b>shadowing.</b> The <b>gap</b> structures seen in scattered light are spatially coincident with sub-mm detections of CO and N_ 2 H^+, and are near expected condensation fronts of these molecular species, providing tentative evidence that the structures seen in scattered light may be correlated with chemical changes in the disk.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} border between formal employment, shadow employment, and {{unemployment}} in an equilibrium model {{of the labor market}} with market frictions. From the labor demand side, firms optimally create legal or shadow employment through a mechanism that is akin to tax evasion. From the labor supply side, heterogeneous workers sort across the two sectors, with high productivity workers entering the legal sector. Such worker sorting appears fully consistent with most empirical evidence on shadow employment. The model sheds also light on the "shadow puzzle", the increasing size of the shadow economy in OECD countries in spite of improvements in technologies detecting tax and social security evasion. Shadow employment is correlated with unemployment, and it is tolerated because the repression of shadow activity increases unemployment. The model implies that <b>shadow</b> wage <b>gaps</b> should be lower in depressed labor markets and that deregulation of labor markets is accompanied by a decline in the average skills of the workforce in both legal and shadow sectors. Based on micro data on two countries with a sizeable shadow economy, Italy and Braziil, we find empirical support to these implications of the model. The paper suggests also that policies aimed at reducing the shadow economy are likely to increase unemployment. Unemployment, Matching, Shadow Activity. ...|$|R

Those wavepaths are much more accurate and robust than broadband rays, since they inherit the frequency dependence and multipathing of the underlying waveeld. We formulate the objective function for our optimization in the image space by relating an image perturbation to a perturbation of the velocity model. The image perturbations are dened using linearized prestack residual migration, thus ensuring stability relative to the rst-order Born approximation assumptions.

40|$|Subsalt imaging is {{strongly}} {{dependent on the}} quality of the velocity model. However, rugose salt bodies complicate wavefield propagation and lead to subsalt multipathing, illumination <b>gaps</b> and <b>shadow</b> zones which cannot be handled correctly by conventional traveltime-based migration velocity analysis. We overcome these limitations by the wave-equation migration velocity analysis technique introduced in a companion paper (Sava and Biondi, 2004) and demonstrate the methodology on a realistic synthetic dataset simulating a salt dome environment and a Gulf of Mexico dataset. We model subsalt propagation using wavepaths created by one-way wavefield extrapolation. Those wavepaths are much more accurate and robust than broadband rays, since they inherit the frequency dependence and multipathing of the underlying wavefield. We formulate an objective function for optimization in the image space by relating an image perturbation to a perturbation of the velocity model. The image perturbations are defined using linearized prestack residual migration, thus ensuring stability relative to the first-order Born approximation assumptions.

40|$|The key {{remaining}} physics design {{issue for}} the ITER tungsten (W) divertor {{is the question of}} monoblock (MB) front surface shaping in the high heat flux target areas of the actively cooled targets. Engineering tolerance specifications impose a challenging maximum radial step between toroidally adjacent MBs of 0. 3 mm. Assuming optical projection of the parallel heat loads, magnetic shadowing of these edges is required if quasi-steady state melting is to be avoided under certain conditions during burning plasma operation and transiently during edge localized mode (ELM) or disruption induced power loading. An experiment on JET in 2013 designed to investigate the consequences of transient W edge melting on ITER, found significant deficits in the edge power loads expected on the basis of simple geometric arguments, throwing doubt on the understanding of edge loading at glancing field line angles. As a result, a coordinated multi-experiment and simulation effort was initiated via the International Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA) and through ITER contracts, aimed at improving the physics basis supporting a MB shaping decision {{from the point of view}} both of edge power loading and melt dynamics. This paper reports on the outcome of this activity, concluding first that the geometrical approximation for leading edge power loading on radially misaligned poloidal leading edges is indeed valid. On this basis, the behaviour of shaped and unshaped monoblock surfaces under stationary and transient loads, with and without melting, is compared in order to examine the consequences of melting, or power overload in context of the benefit, or not, of shaping. The paper concludes that MB top surface shaping is recommended to <b>shadow</b> poloidal <b>gap</b> edges in the high heat flux areas of the ITER divertor targets...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{mapping of}} forest species {{composition}} {{is an important}} aspect of monitoring and management planning related to ecosystem functions and services associated with water refinement, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and wildlife habitats. Although different vegetation species often have unique spectral signatures, mapping based on spectral reflectance properties alone is often an ill-posed problem, since the spectral signature is as well influenced by age, canopy <b>gaps,</b> <b>shadows</b> and background characteristics. Thus, reducing the unknown variation by knowing the structural parameters of different species should improve determination procedures. In this study we combine imaging spectrometry (IS) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data of a mixed needle and broadleaf forest to differentiate tree species more accurately as single-instrument data could do. Since forest inventory data in dense forests involve uncertainties, we tried to refine them by using individual tree crowns (ITC) position and shape, which derived from ALS data. Comparison of the extracted spectra from original field data and the modified one shows how ALS-derived shape and position of ITCs can improve separablity of the different species.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{observational}} consequences of partial gaps being opened by planets in protoplanetary disks. We model the disk using a static alpha-disk model with detailed radiative transfer, parametrizing {{the shape and}} size of the partially cleared gaps {{based on the results of}} hydrodynamic simulations. Shadowing and illumination by stellar irradiation at the surface of the gap leads to increased contrast as the gap trough is deepened by shadowing and cooling and the far gap wall is puffed up by illumination and heating. In calculating observables, we find that multiple scattering is important and derive an approximation to include these effects. A gap produced by a 200 M_Earth (70 M_Earth) planet at 10 AU can lower/raise the midplane temperature of the disk by up to ~- 25 /+ 29 % (~- 11 /+ 19 %) by <b>shadowing</b> in the <b>gap</b> trough and illumination on the far shoulder of the gap. At the distance of Taurus, this gap would be resolvable with ~ 0. 01 " angular resolution. The gap contrast is most significant in scattered light and at thermal continuum wavelengths characteristic of the surface temperature, reducing or raising the surface brightness by up to order of magnitude. Since gaps sizes are correlated to planet mass, this is a promising way of finding and determining the masses of planets embedded in protoplanetary disks. Comment: 11 pages, 9 figures.

The combined power of extreme adaptive optics and differential imaging techniques delivers high spatial resolution images of disk morphologies down to several astronomical units from the star. The {{distribution of the}} small dust grains in the disk surface provides important clues about the processes that drive disk evolution and the shaping effects of embedded planets on their circumstellar environment. The scattered light is also imprinted by {{the properties of the}} dust particles through their color and angle of scattering.

40|$|Protoplanetary disks {{are where}} planets form, grow, and migrate {{to produce the}} {{diversity}} of exoplanet systems we observe in mature systems. Disks where this process has advanced to the stage of gap opening, {{and in some cases}} central cavity formation, have been termed pre-transitional and transitional disks in the hope that they represent intermediate steps toward planetary system formation. Recent reviews have focussed on disks where the star is of solar or sub-solar mass. In contrast to the sub-millimeter where cleared central cavities predominate, at H-band some T Tauri star transitional disks resemble primordial disks in having no indication of clearing, some show a break in the radial surface brightness profile at the inner edge of the outer disk, while others have partially to fully cleared gaps or central cavities. Recently, the Meeus Group I Herbig stars, intermediate-mass PMS stars with IR spectral energy distributions often interpreted as flared disks, have been proposed to have transitional and pre-transitional disks similar to those associated with solar-mass PMS stars, based on thermal-IR imaging, and sub-millimeter interferometry. We have investigated their appearance in scattered light as part of the Strategic Exploration of Exoplanets and Disks with Subaru (SEEDS), obtaining H-band polarimetric imagery of 10 intermediate-mass stars with Meeus Group I disks. Augmented by other disks with imagery in the literature, the sample is now sufficiently large to explore how these disks are similar to and differ from T Tauri star disks. The disk morphologies seen in the Tauri disks are also found for the intermediate-mass star disks, but additional phenomena are found; a hallmark of these disks is remarkable individuality and diversity which does not simply correlate with disk mass or stellar properties, including age, including spiral arms in remnant envelopes, arms in the disk, asymmetrically and potentially variably <b>shadowed</b> outer disks, <b>gaps,</b> and one disk where only half of the disk is seen in scattered light at H. We will discuss our survey results in terms of spiral arm theory, dust trapping vortices, and systematic differences in the relative scale height of these disks compared to those around Solar-mass stars. For the disks with spiral arms we discuss the planet-hosting potential, and limits on where giant planets can be located.
