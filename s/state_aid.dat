5|$|Another issue arose when Cardinal Norman Gilroy {{presented}} Heffron in September 1962 with a {{plan for}} <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> to Catholic Church schools, including assistance for teacher salaries and capital grants for buildings, an issue that was highly explosive in the sectarian politics of New South Wales at the time. Heffron, alive {{to the need for}} a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy the government, permitted Treasurer Jack Renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means-tested allowance to school students in the 1963 budget. Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the Federal Party Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were less interested in placating the traditional Catholic hierarchy and more informed by the bitterness of the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed down on this last provision, leaving no <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> for Catholic schools, and affirming the dominance of the Federal party in such matters.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, {{planning}} permission for the redevelopment was granted. The {{cost of the}} project was estimated to be around £29.2million, of which £25.2million would come from government funding. It was initially planned for the work to begin in September 2013. Two months later however, Crusaders began legal proceedings against the redevelopment. The club called for the process to be judicially reviewed, believing it to be against European Union competition laws and also a form of <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> towards Linfield. When Crusaders played Linfield at Windsor Park at the end of April, their club officials were allegedly informed {{that they would not be}} welcome in the directors box or the boardroom during the game – an apparent reaction to Crusaders' legal challenge of the stadium redevelopment. In a hearing that took place on 22 May 2013, Crusaders' request was granted. It was ruled that it was a possibility for the redevelopment to be classed as <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> towards Linfield. The aspect of the challenge concerning competition law however, was dismissed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the pattern}} of <b>state</b> <b>aids</b> to the manufacturing sector in ten EC countries for the period 1981 [...] 90. It focuses on determinants suggested by {{the political economy of}} <b>state</b> <b>aids.</b> We estimate a regression model where the intensity of <b>state</b> <b>aids</b> is accounted for by the weakness of government, their ideological orientation, the concentration of industry, and the timing of elections. The evidence indicates that the fractionalization of political parties is associated with higher <b>state</b> <b>aids.</b> We also find support for the view that <b>state</b> <b>aids</b> are higher under right-wing governments and when firms' interests are highly concentrated. This is consistent with a partisan view of government in which firms represent an important constituency for right-wing coalitions. By contrast, the timing of elections does not seem to matter. Finally, the paper observes significant fixed country effects. We gather evidence on the transparency of procedures used to allocate and control <b>state</b> <b>aids</b> and suggest that these fixed effects could be associated with lax procedures which enhance the scope for capture.

40|$|Provisions on the {{restriction}} of <b>State</b> <b>aids</b> form {{an important part}} of the primary and secondary EU competition law. The basic premise of the regulation is the circumstance that <b>aid</b> provided by <b>States</b> from public resources to enterprises can distort the competition within the EU and therefore is declared for incompatible with the EU internal market. At the same time we must realise that there are several situations in which a suitably scheduled <b>State</b> <b>aids</b> can act as a positive input to the development of the internal market and therefore a complete prohibition of <b>State</b> <b>aids</b> would be rather counter-productive. In several areas of the competition regulation rules and criteria for the admissibility of suitable <b>State</b> <b>aids</b> are formulated by the EU law. The rules for the admissibility of <b>State</b> <b>aids</b> for the support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are one of these areas. The aim of the present article is to analyze the requirements for the provision of <b>State</b> <b>aids</b> to the SMEs as laid down by the SME block exemption of 2001 and, consequently, by the new GBER in force since 29 August 2008. Consequently the article analyses the impact of the <b>State</b> <b>aids</b> both on the supported SME and on the relevant market and/or the potential distortion of the completion it may cause. The analysis of the methodology for the assessment of aid for SMEs will be provided in order to define the categories of specific SME exemptions given by the EU Council regulation. Finally, the procedure for the approval of <b>State</b> <b>aids</b> to SME that fall outside the block exemptions, will be outlined. Comparative method will be used in order to evaluate the possible procedures available to the Member States...|$|R
40|$|Transfers to {{firms and}} regions are made {{both at the}} level of member <b>states</b> (<b>state</b> <b>aids)</b> and {{at the level of}} the European Commission (Structural Funds). <b>State</b> <b>aids</b> can take {{different}} forms: direct (transfers, tax exemptions) or indirect (e. g. the definition of the reserved area in network industries). There are significant cross-country differences both in the magnitude and the type of instruments used for <b>state</b> <b>aids.</b> The European Commission acts as a de-facto regulator by using competition law to approve <b>state</b> <b>aids.</b> We analyze the rationale of this two step process by pointing out the benefits of decentralizing redistributive decisions to the member states and the costs linked to reduced coordination (the use of structural funds, viewed as a complement to <b>state</b> <b>aids,</b> reduces some of these costs). We then point out that in a second best world objectives of redistribution are not incompatible with competition but that their relationship is less straightforward than with perfect markets; this has consequences for the rationale of having block exemptions, and for the effects of structural funds.

5|$|The electoral {{district}} of Perth was created {{as one of}} the initial 30 single-member districts, and one of only six in the Perth–Fremantle area. Its first member, who was elected on 10 December 1890, was Dr Edward Scott, a doctor by training who had been elected as Mayor of Perth the previous year. He resigned in December 1891, and was replaced at the resulting by-election on 12 January 1892 by Thomas Molloy. Molloy became embroiled in a controversy regarding provision of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> to private schools, which he and fellow Catholic MLAs Timothy Quinlan and Alfred Canning supported. The Catholic Vicar General, Father Anselm Bourke, established the Education Defence League with their assistance. However, the issue became a major one in the 1894 election amongst the voting public, and all three MLAs lost their seats, Molloy losing to George Randell, a prominent Congregationalist who had led the cause against <b>state</b> <b>aid.</b> Randell became the Opposition Leader to Premier John Forrest, but stepped down from that role a year later in July 1895, and did not contest the 1897 election, which was won by a supporter of Forrest.|$|E

40|$|Proefskrif (PhD) [...] PU vir CHO, 1994 The {{research}} for designing {{a model of}} a management information system for a <b>state</b> <b>aided</b> school is divided into five phases. In the first instance it was determined what a <b>state</b> <b>aided</b> school is, who are involved with the <b>state</b> <b>aided</b> school and what their functions are in relation to the school. Secondly, the managers of <b>state</b> <b>aided</b> schools are identified. The managerial functions in the different management areas and the implications thereof for the management information system are investigated In the third instance, it is revealed that a management information system is a sub-system of the <b>state</b> <b>aided</b> school, while itself consists of components or sub-systems. It is shown that the purpose of a management information system is to provide managers at the right time, with the correct information in the most suitable format to support them in their management task. In the fourth instance it is shown that principals of <b>state</b> <b>aided</b> schools regard information in connection with pupils, staff, the community, finance, curriculum, facilities and equipment as very important for their management tasks. It is also indicated that the existing management information systems at schools are less successful in providing principals with the information that is required for their management tasks. In the final phase it reveals that a management Information system tor a <b>state</b> <b>aided</b> school should consist of a data base with a data base management system, application programmes, supporting programmes, a computer network, competent computer staff and comprehensive procedures.

Currently, the EU Commission presumes that <b>state</b> <b>aids</b> distort competition, yet it approves 98 % of applications, often for social or distributional reasons.

The campaign against Democratic nominee William Allen focused primarily on Protestant fears of the possibility of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> to Catholic schools. Hayes was against such funding and, while he was not known to be personally anti-Catholic, he allowed anti-Catholic fervor to contribute to the enthusiasm for his candidacy. The campaign was a success, and Hayes was returned to the governorship by a 5,544-vote majority. The first person to earn a third term as Governor of Ohio, Hayes reduced the state debt, re-established the Board of Charities, and repealed the Geghan Bill, which had allowed for the appointment of Catholic priests to schools and penitentiaries.|$|E

5|$|The Washington State Legislature {{created the}} State Highway Board in 1905 and {{appropriated}} funds to construct—but not maintain—twelve highways in sparsely settled {{areas of the}} state. Main highways in more populated areas {{would continue to be}} entirely under county control, though sometimes built with 50% <b>state</b> <b>aid.</b> Six of these highways were east-west crossings of the Cascades, including one in the corridor currently served by U.S. Route 12—State Road 5, the Cowlitz Pass State Road, climbing east from a point near Salkum via the Cowlitz River, over Cowlitz Pass, and down towards Yakima. A 1907 amendment renamed State Road 5 the Cowlitz-Natches Road, moved the Cascade crossing north to Carlton Pass, and defined the portion east of the pass to follow the Bumping River and Naches River to a point near Naches. East of the mouth of the American River, this replaced part of State Road 1 (North Yakima and Natches State Road), which had been defined in 1897 to cross the Cascades north of Chinook Pass and included in the 1905 appropriations.|$|E
5|$|The Delaware State Highway Department (DSHD) {{was created}} on April 2, 1917 to {{construct}} and maintain a system of state highways across Delaware. As a result, the state took over construction of the DuPont Highway. The DuPont Highway was completed in 1923 when the final section near Odessa was finished. The DuPont Highway was a boon to southern Delaware, which had formerly been economically isolated from the large cities of the northeast. In conjunction {{with the rise of}} the automobile, the highway spurred the growth of the Delaware Beaches by greatly improving access to the coast for tourists from northern Delaware and adjacent portions of the Northeast megalopolis. Southern Delaware also developed into a major truck farming region due to having much greater access to urban markets. No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods, farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits, vegetables, and broiler chickens directly to consumers in the north. Also during this time, the <b>State</b> <b>Aid</b> Road Law ushered in a period of highway improvement in which the county would offer road bonds and the state would match. The DSHD would then improve the highway. Most of the highways improved by the DSHD were built as concrete roads, with sharp curves eliminated. The state also took over the last of the private turnpikes and converted them to free roads. In 1926, the state began eliminating several railroad grade crossings and in 1927 the first all-weather secondary roads were constructed, consisting of one concrete lane and one dirt lane in an effort to reduce costs.|$|E

One of those solutions passed by the General Assembly was the 1904 <b>State</b> <b>Aid</b> Highway Law, {{also known as the}} Shoemaker Law, which offered the counties and municipalities expert advice and technical assistance from the Maryland Geological Survey and funding for one half of the cost of macadam roads constructed by the county. The first improved highways along what became US113 in Worcester County were constructed under the provisions of the 1904 law. Worcester County constructed three mile-long macadam roads that became US113 with state aid: from the south town limit of Berlin to Hayes Landing Road in 1907, from the east town limit of Snow Hill to Purnells Mill Pond in 1907 and 1908, and from the north town limit of Berlin toward Showell in 1909 and 1910.|$|E
