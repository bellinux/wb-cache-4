5|$|The {{chemical}} composition of fruit bodies collected from Turkey has been analyzed, and the dried fruit bodies determined {{to contain the}} following nutritional components: protein, 19.46%; fat, 3.65%; ash, 32.51%; carbohydrates, 44.38% (including 6.71% as non-digestible cellulose). Fresh fruit bodies have a moisture content of 84.4%.

5|$|The current chapel is Oriel's third, {{the first}} being built around 1373 {{on the north}} side of the front quadrangle. By 1566, the chapel was located on the south side of the quadrangle, as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> drawing made for Elizabeth I's visit to Oxford in that year. The present {{building}} was consecrated in 1642 and despite subsequent restorations it largely retains its original appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was filmed and {{directed}} by Howard Greenhalgh on 10 November 1997 in a studio located in London. The video features each Spice Girl in their own individual scene, inspired by their own movie fantasies. Melanie Brown is shown singing {{on top of a}} tank strapped with ammunition in an industrial post-apocalyptic war scene in a segment based on the film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Emma Bunton is <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bedroom dressed in white pyjamas while objects float around her on their own; her scene is based on Poltergeist. Melanie Chisholm is <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Chinatown, dressed in a red cheongsam and black pants with her hair in a long ponytail with red streaks; her scene is based upon Year of the Dragon. Geri Halliwell is featured in a black-and-white scene based on Rita Hayworth's performance in Gilda. She is shown performing on a smoky stage in a long, white sequined gown with a group of sailors dancing around her. Victoria Beckham is <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> missile silo next to a smoking rocket, clad in a black catsuit and with a long ponytail; she is portraying Catwoman from Batman Returns.|$|E

5|$|A running joke {{throughout}} the film series is Moneypenny's unrequited love for Bond and his playful flirting with her. She flirts back, jokes and sometimes pouts, hoping to wrangle a proposal and {{a wedding ring}} out of him. A fantasy sequence in Die Another Day marks the only occasion in the Eon film series in which Moneypenny was actually <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic embrace with Bond, although this is only in Q-branch's virtual reality machine.|$|E

5|$|Also on 13 September 1926, {{a further}} {{connection}} between the CCE and the C was opened when tunnels were brought into service from the CCE's Charing Cross station (now Embankment) to Kennington station, the latter having been rebuilt with four platforms. An intermediate station was constructed at Waterloo. Thus fully integrated, combined services operated over the C and CCE routes using new Standard Stock trains. On tube maps, the combined lines were then <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single colour, although the separate names continued in use into the 1930s. Before the introduction of 'Northern line' on 28 August 1937, the names 'Edgware, Highgate and Morden line' and 'Morden-Edgware line' {{were used in the}} mid-1930s.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the most}} sought-after lost episode is Episode 4 of the final William Hartnell serial, The Tenth Planet, which ends with the First Doctor's {{regeneration}} into the Second. The only portion of the episode still in existence, bar a few poor-quality silent 8mm clips, is the final 27 seconds, comprising the regeneration itself and a few seconds leading up to it. The sequence had been <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 1973 episode of Blue Peter, and was retained in that show's archive.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (<b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{diversity}} of crops {{can be used}} to help protect the environment. Crop varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases can reduce the need for application of harmfulpesticides.While crops that are more vigorous can better compete withweeds whichreduces the need for applyingherbicides. This is <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> case study completed atAarhus Universityin Denmark which used more robust maize.Drought resistant plants can help save water and reduce the need forirrigation whiledeeper rooting varieties can help stabilize soils; and varieties that are more efficient in their use of nutrients require lessfertilizer.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Striptease made news {{again when}} it was <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fourth-grade class in Chicago, Illinois. The teacher claimed the {{students}} chose the film, but he drew criticism since the film was risqué. (The violent 1996 film Scream was shown in the same school on the same day, causing further controversy.) In 2000 in Ireland, some viewers criticized the Radio Telefís Éireann for running Striptease. These viewers questioned the film's appropriateness and some considered it demeaning to women. However, the station felt it was not pornography and it was aired at night.|$|E
5|$|In January 2002, Jenner {{participated in}} an episode of the American series The Weakest Link, {{featuring}} Olympic athletes.

She made a cameo appearance in a season-three episode of The Apprentice, which aired in May 2005. She also partnered with Tai Babilonia for Skating with Celebrities in a series that aired JanuaryMarch 2006 (they were eliminated during the fifth of seven episodes), served as a guest judge on Pet Star on Animal Planet, as well as (with the Kardashian family) on Celebrity Family Feud. In November 2010, a photograph of Jenner was <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> janitor's resume in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|It was {{announced}} alongside Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep and Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days at the Tokyo Game Show on September 20, 2007, where a trailer was <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> photo-prohibited theater. New trailers were {{shown at the}} 2008 Jump Festa in December 2007 and the DKΣ3713 Private party in August 2008. Playable demonstrations, {{as well as new}} trailers, were available at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show in October 2008 and the 2009 Jump Festa in December 2008. Early trailers highlighted codeds gameplay, while later ones focused more on the game's story, which would fill in some plotholes present in the first Kingdom Hearts game.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characters}} in the Arthurian legends are described with coats of arms. Lancelot starts with plain white arms but later receives a shield with three bends gules signifying the strength of three men (Brault 47). Tristran was attributed a variety of arms. His earliest arms, a gold lion rampant on red field, are <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> set of 13th-century tiles found in Chertsey Abbey (Loomis 1915, 308). Thomas of Britain in the 12th century attributed these arms (Loomis 1938, 47) in what {{is believed to be}} heraldic flattery of his patron, either Richard I or Henry II, whose coats of arms contained some form of lion (Loomis 1922, 26). In other versions the field is not red, but green. Gottfried von Strassburg attributed to Tristan a silver shield with a black boar rampant (Loomis 1922, 24; Loomis 1938, 49). In Italy, however, he was attributed geometric patterns (argent a bend gules per Loomis 1938, 59).|$|E
