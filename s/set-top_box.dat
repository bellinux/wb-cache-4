5|$|Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) is an HDMI feature {{designed}} to allow the user to command and control up to 15 CEC-enabled devices, that are connected through HDMI, by using only one of their remote controls (for example by controlling a television set, <b>set-top</b> <b>box,</b> and DVD player using only the remote control of the TV). CEC also allows for individual CEC-enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of Angry Birds has helped spread {{the game to}} other devices that were not initially designed as gaming machines. Barnes & Noble announced that a future update for its Nook Color e-reader will let the Android-based device run applications, including a port of Angry Birds. In June 2011, Rovio announced plans to partner with Roku to include a version of Angry Birds on {{a new model of}} its Internet-connected <b>set-top</b> <b>box,</b> the Roku 2 XS.|$|E
5|$|There are radio {{stations}} broadcasting via Satellite to the United Kingdom, however these {{are aimed at}} home users for playback through their televisions since these same satellites are also used for television broadcast and usually use SES' Astra series of satellites at 28.2° east or the Eutelsat 28A satellite at 28.5° east. Radio stations broadcast free-to-air via the Sky Digital, Freesat from Sky platforms and any DVB-S compliant <b>set-top</b> <b>box.</b> The Freesat platform has all the BBC's national and regional digital {{radio stations}} as well as BBC London 94.9 from the launch on 6 May 2008 on the EPG.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of ADB <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> {{can be used}} to receive television services from different types of transmission networks simultaneously. <b>Set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> with this capability are known in the television industry as hybrid <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|General Satellite Corporation {{implements}} CSMW {{into its}} <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> for digital television (satellite, cable and terrestrial), which provides owners of GS <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> {{with all the}} additional services besides having digital video & audio.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was much}} {{resistance}} from cable operators to the CableCARD rollout across the United States, preferring {{to support their}} own <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes.</b> The adoption proceeded slowly with 141,000 units by February 2006. The resistance softened somewhat with the July 2007 FCC ban on integrated security in <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes,</b> which required all new <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> to use CableCARDs as their decryption mechanism. By June 2009, the top 10 [...] "incumbent" [...] U.S. cable operators had deployed more than 14 million operator-supplied set-tops with CableCARDs and 437,800 CableCARD modules for use in retail devices. [...] The National Cable Television Association reported in April 2016 that only 621,400 CableCARDs were deployed for use in retail devices by the nine largest incumbent cable operators, compared to 55 million operator-supplied <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> with CableCARDs.This indicates that the CableCARD failed to achieve {{the goal of a}} competitive retail market for <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{areas where}} {{analogue}} signals had terminated, older receiving equipment {{was likely to}} require replacement or upgrade. This process was subsidised by the UK Government for those on low incomes. Contracts for this operation were awarded to BSkyB in the Border Television region. Upgrading of analogue receiving equipment required a Freeview <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> (or other DVB-T capable digital receiver). Where an analogue TV recording device was in use this ideally would require a separate Freeview <b>set-top</b> <b>box,</b> to replicate the previous functionality of recording and watching different programme sources.|$|E
50|$|Inview's {{solution}} for existing (older) deployed <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> {{is to offer}} applications including an EPG and TV apps that can run in devices with limited memory and processing power.

40|$|Abstract. This paper shows a grid {{computing}} architecture called Grid Any-where {{which aims}} at allowing {{the sharing of}} the computational resources from <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> (receiver) of an Interactive Digital Television System. This shar-ing is made in a {{such a way that}} the TV broadcaster can use the <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> tuned to it to get a high computational power and the user can also use remote resource of others devices (<b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> or personal computers) to increase the performance of the application executed in his receiver...|$|R
50|$|The first <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> were {{produced}} by Jerrold Communications from 1995 to 1998; after the Jerrold name {{went out of}} use, and following its subsequent acquisition by Motorola, the subsequent <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> {{were produced}} by Motorola from 1998 to 2004. During that period, a second design was introduced, which is also seen in the commercial announcing the end of analogue cable transmission on 30 June 2009. The Digital, HD, Hubstation & Hubstation HD <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> were made by Advanced Digital Broadcast and Thomson SA.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Brazil is {{producing}} {{several types of}} TV sets and <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> for the SBTVD (ISDB-Tb) system and in a good quantity {{and there is no}} problem meeting the consumer demand for TV sets, <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> and also for transmitters and other components.|$|R
25|$|Digital Terrestrial Television is {{commonly}} received {{by means of}} a compatible <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> or integrated digital television (IDTV), connected to an appropriate receiving antenna. In most cases, reception is possible using aerials originally used for analogue television.|$|E
25|$|Many viewers {{find that}} when they acquire a digital {{television}} or <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> {{they are unable to}} view closed caption (CC) information, even though the broadcaster is sending it and the TV is able to display it.|$|E
25|$|Telewest (one of Virgin Media's predecessors) {{became the}} first UK {{broadcaster}} to offer HDTV, launching its service in December 2005; several months earlier than that of its chief competitor, Sky. An HD-enabled <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> is required to view HDTV.|$|E
50|$|Set-top-box models {{support the}} {{specific}} physical reception and return-channel messaging {{requirements of the}} television transmission infrastructure {{where they will be}} deployed, such as cable, satellite, IPTV or digital terrestrial TV. Cable <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> include a choice of return path such as V.92 modem for low-level two-way interactivity or, for high-speed two-way communications, an Ethernet interface or fully integrated DOCSIS modem. <b>Set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> designed for U.S. cable operators are CableLabs certified. A selection of ADB's <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> include home networking capabilities using DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) and UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) standards.|$|R
50|$|The V+ Boxes {{have three}} video tuners, {{allowing}} {{the user to}} record two programmes to the hard drive while watching a live programme which can then be paused. V+'s main competitor on the British market, the Sky+ HD box, has two tuners. As with all other Digital <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> from Virgin Media. The <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> support 720p and 1080i high definition video via HDMI and component output and is capable of upscaling SD video to HD resolutions. The copying of some programmes may be restricted by using HDCP. The <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> also support Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, which is currently broadcast on some HD channels and video on demand (VOD) content. Both <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> support DVB-C transmission using MPEG-2 compression, the standard used by Virgin for both SD and HD video.|$|R

25|$|In 2016, the Teefax {{teletext}} service {{was launched in}} the United Kingdom to coverage by the BBC, ITV and others. Using a Raspberry Pi computer card as a <b>set-top</b> <b>box,</b> it feeds its service to standard televisions. Teefax content {{is a mix of}} crowdsourcing, syndication and contributions from media professionals who contributed heavily to broadcast {{teletext service}}s. Teefax is also syndicated to a web viewer.|$|E
25|$|Katz Media never {{sold the}} KMP 2000 {{in the retail}} market. Instead, it {{attempted}} to use {{the system as a}} <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> for a television set or VGA display, to be distributed to its partners' respective client bases in order to interface with a variety of vertically marketed interests, such as catalogs, databases, Internet content, and so on. As a result, the Katz Media KMP 2000 is the rarest of the Pippin systems, and is extremely difficult to find in today's used market.|$|E
25|$|For older televisions, a <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> {{or other}} decoder is usually required. In the US, since {{the passage of}} the Television Decoder Circuitry Act, {{manufacturers}} of most television receivers sold have been required to include closed captioning display capability. High-definition TV sets, receivers, and tuner cards are also covered, though the technical specifications are different (high-definition display screens, as opposed to high-definition TVs, may lack captioning). Canada has no similar law but receives the same sets as the US in most cases.|$|E

25|$|During 2008, {{a rolling}} {{programme}} of transmitter updates caused approximately 250,000 <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes</b> {{to stop working}} altogether. Freeview had warned consumers {{in advance of the}} update, which was phased over a three-month period. The problem affected a specific range of older units, and was caused by an increased Network Information Table (channel list) exceeding the memory available in some <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes.</b> This {{had been part of the}} specification that was available and implemented in the very early OnDigital boxes, but not in those using the SetPal chip set. Affected consumers were advised to buy new <b>set-top</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R

25|$|DTTV is {{received}} either via a digital <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> (STB), TV gateway or integrated tuner included with television sets, that decodes the signal received via a standard television antenna. Some set-top-boxes and TV gateways include {{digital video recorder}} (DVR) functionality. However, due to frequency planning issues, an aerial capable of receiving a different channel group (usually a wideband) may be required if the DTTV multiplexes lie outside the reception capabilities of the originally installed aerial. This is quite common in the UK; see external links.|$|E
25|$|Thailand and {{the rest}} of ASEAN {{countries}} (with the exception of the Philippines; see above) have selected DVB-T as the final DTV standard, and are expected to switch off analogue broadcasts completely by 2015. In June 2008, participants of the 6th ASEAN Digital Broadcast Meeting from seven south-east Asian countries (including Thailand) agreed to finalise the specifications of the DTV <b>set-top</b> <b>box</b> for use within ASEAN, and also set up an ASEAN HD Centre to provide training on HDTV content to broadcasters in the region.|$|E
