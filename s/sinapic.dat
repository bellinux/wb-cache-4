Methods: In this experimental study, 64 male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into 8 groups. Control animals were intact. Sham group received vehicle of <b>sinapic</b> acid (Tween 80, 10 %). The experimental rats administrated with <b>sinapic</b> acid at doses 0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 05, 0. 1, 1 and 10 g/rat respectively. <b>Sinapic</b> acid and Tween 80 were injected intracerebroventricular and post-training.

40|$|Rapeseed meal is a {{cheap and}} {{abundant}} raw material, particularly rich in phenolic compounds of biotechnological interest. In this study, {{we developed a}} two-step bioconversion process of naturally occurring <b>sinapic</b> acid (4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -dimethoxycinnamic acid) from rapeseed meal into canolol by combining the complementary potentialities of two filamentous fungi, the micromycete Aspergillus niger and the basidiomycete Neolentinus lepideus. Canolol could display numerous industrial applications because of its high antioxidant, antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties. In {{the first step of}} the process, the use of the enzyme feruloyl esterase type-A (named AnFaeA) produced with the recombinant strain A. niger BRFM 451 made it possible to release free <b>sinapic</b> acid from the raw meal by hydrolysing the conjugated forms of <b>sinapic</b> acid in the meal (mainly sinapine and glucopyranosyl sinapate). An amount of 39 nkat AnFaeA per gram of raw meal, at 55 °C and pH 5, led to the recovery of 6. 6 to 7. 4 mg of free <b>sinapic</b> acid per gram raw meal, which corresponded to a global hydrolysis yield of 68 to 76 % and a 100 % hydrolysis of sinapine. Then, the XAD 2 adsorbent (a styrene and divinylbenzene copolymer resin), used at pH 4, enabled the efficient recovery of the released <b>sinapic</b> acid, and its concentration after elution with ethanol. In the second step, 3 -day-old submerged cultures of the strain N. lepideus BRFM 15 were supplied with the recovered <b>sinapic</b> acid as the substrate of bioconversion into canolol by a non-oxidative decarboxylation pathway. Canolol production reached 1. 3 g/L with a molar yield of bioconversion of 80 % and a productivity of 100 mg/L day. The same XAD 2 resin, when used at pH 7, allowed the recovery and purification of canolol from the culture broth of N. lepideus. The two-step process used mild conditions compatible with green chemistry. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Rapeseed meal is the {{co-product}} of {{the pressing}} and de-oiling process of rapeseed seeds {{and is used}} as animal feed. Most of phenolic compounds remain in the meal after processing the seeds. While sinapine (sinapoyl choline), sinapoyl glucose and <b>sinapic</b> acid are naturally present in the seed, canolol (4 -vinylsyringol) is formed during processes of pressing, oil extraction and roasting treatments via decarboxylation of <b>sinapic</b> acid. Canolol was recently described as a free-radical scavenger with various biological activities. One of the objectives of this work was the valorization of rapeseed meal {{as a source of}} canolol, this latter being produced through the transformation of sinapine and <b>sinapic</b> acid under hydration and roasting processes applicable at industrial scale. The parameters studied for the rapeseed meal processing were: (i) time of incubation after hydration: 0, 2 and 18 h and, (ii) thermal treatment: high-temperature steam (105 °– 160 °C) or microwave roasting (160 °– 180 °C). It was concluded that temperature, and exposure time in case of microwaves, were the most important factors in increasing concentrations of canolol in rapeseed meal. Incubation time after hydration did not influence the total phenolic compounds content suggesting the absence of endogenous enzymatic hydrolysis. However, it showed a particular contribution in sinapine, <b>sinapic</b> acid and canolol transformation during the microwave treatment. Finally, whatever the treatment, only a part of the <b>sinapic</b> acid initially present or generated during the processes, was converted into canolol. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} and kinetics underlying reactions between the naturally-occurring antioxidant <b>sinapic</b> acid (SA) {{and the very}} damaging ·NO 2 and ·OH were investigated through the density functional theory (DFT). Two most possible reaction mechanisms were studied: hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical adduct formation (RAF). Different reaction channels of neutral and anionic <b>sinapic</b> acid (SA-) scavenging radicals in both atmosphere and water medium were traced independently, and the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were calculated. We find the most active site of SA/SA- scavenging ·NO 2 and ·OH is the -OH group in benzene ring by HAT mechanism, while the RAF mechanism for SA/SA- scavenging ·NO 2 seems thermodynamically unfavorable. In water phase, at 298 K, the total rate constants of SA eliminating ·NO 2 and ·OH are 1. 30 × 108 and 9. 20 × 109 M- 1 S- 1 respectively, indicating that <b>sinapic</b> acid is an efficient scavenger for both ·NO 2 and ·OH...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{changes in}} {{antioxidant}} compounds of Brassica oleracea L. var. costata DC seeds were monitored {{during the first}} twelve days of seedling development. Sprouts were screened at time intervals of two days for phenolic com-pounds and organic acids. The identified phenolic compounds included esters of <b>sinapic</b> acid with glucose, gentiobiose and kaempferol, as well as sinapoylcholine. The organic acids were oxalic, aconitic, citric, pyruvic, malic, shikimic, and fumaric acids. During germination, a depletion of phenolic compounds was observed, although no qualitative changes were seen. Among individual compounds, kaempferol, choline and glucose esters of <b>sinapic</b> acid showed a marked de-crease between days two and six, whereas the changes in gentiobiose esters of <b>sinapic</b> acid were smaller. The total organic acids content increased rapidly during the first four days, with less significant variations thereafter.

This final product helps stabilize the accumulation of anthocyanins. In this study, a gene named DcUSAGT 1 encoding USAGT was cloned from 'Deep purple' carrot taproots. Enzymatic activity was determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The optimal temperature and pH value were 30 °C and 7. 0, respectively.

Expression profiles of DcUSAGT 1 showed high expression levels in the taproots of all the three purple carrot cultivars but low expression levels in those of non-purple carrot cultivars.
