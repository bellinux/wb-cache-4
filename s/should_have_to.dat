5|$|Fed up {{with the}} {{attitude}} {{that he had to}} prove himself in the NFL, McKay once drunkenly needled Don Shula by saying, “I think pro coaches <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> prove themselves by winning four national championships in the colleges”. He later admitted to having ruffled some feathers in the NFL, but said, “it wasn’t as if they didn’t deserve it”.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 1941, the German Wehrmacht invaded Greece {{to support}} its Italian ally in the stalemated conflict. British {{planners}} suggested using the ship to block the Corinth Canal by scuttling her at the southern entrance to the canal, but the Greeks refused, preferring to use the ship as a barracks ship if they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> retreat from Salamis. The ship was attacked in Salamis Naval Base by Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers on 23 April 1941, during the German invasion. Kilkis attempted to get underway to evade the attacks, but she was hit by several bombs and sank in the harbor. Her wreck was refloated and broken up for scrap in the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|In August 2013, former High Court justice Ian Callinan {{recommended}} 23 more {{changes to}} the Victorian parole system. In particular, he recommended that a full-time parole board be established to replace the current part-time one and that prisoners <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> prove that they were low risk reoffenders before being granted parole. An electronic database, to replace the paper filing system currently in use, was also recommended.|$|E
25|$|Since many {{organizations}} depend on customers for profit, companies primarily evaluate employees {{based on their}} performance with customers. These customer reviews are then used to shape how companies function internally, directing what kinds of goals employees <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> achieve the company's overall mission. Then, organizations can assess performance based on the products that employees create. Finally, financial performance measures should be a focus to identify how employee achievements contribute to the business' profitability.|$|E
25|$|Chilean {{software}} engineer Jorge Arellano Cid conceived the Dillo project in late 1999, publishing {{the first version}} of Dillo in December of that year. His primary goal in creating Dillo was to democratize access to information. Arellano Cid believed that no one <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> buy a new computer or pay for broadband in order to enjoy the World Wide Web. To this end, he designed Dillo to be small, fast, and efficient, capable of performing well even on an Intel 80486 CPU with a dial-up Internet access.|$|E

25|$|Dish fired a wheelchair-bound quadriplegic man, Brandon Coats, {{from his}} job as a {{telephone}} operator in 2010 for using medical-marijuana during off-work hours. Coats used marijuana to control muscle spasms. His paralysis was due to injuries from a car crash. Coats failed a random drug test. Coats sued claiming that marijuana use was legal and that he was a model employee. Coats suit relied under a Colorado law called the Lawful Off-Duty Activities Statute that prohibits employers from firing employees for doing legal things during their personal time. The trial court and Colorado Court of Appeals ruled in Coats v. Dish Network that since marijuana is banned by federal law it does not qualify as legal activity despite being permitted by state law. The trial court ruled that Coats <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay Dish's legal fees; the appeals court overturned this ruling.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} {{on the morning of}} the day before Yom Kippur, they placed the High Priest at the Eastern Gate and brought before him oxen, rams, and sheep, so that he could become {{familiar}} with the service. The rest of the seven days, they did not withhold food or drink from him, but near nightfall on the eve of Yom Kippur, they would not let him eat much, as food might make him sleep. The sages of the court took him up to the house of Avtinas and handed him over to the elders of the priesthood. As the sages of the court took their leave, they cautioned him that he was the messenger of the court, and adjured him in God's Name that he not change anything in the service from what they had told him. He and they turned aside and wept that they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> suspect him of doing so.|$|E
25|$|James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, {{new head}} {{writers of the}} series, were {{reluctant}} to state whether or not Havins would be departing the soap opera. In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s {{out there that we}} will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If we <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like what we did with the Greenlee recast. We saw some little things in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, but you get into real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t have any trouble separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{claim that}} the new 421-a program will cost city taxpayers {{even more than the}} old plan. The IBO found that the new 421-a plan would cost add $120 million per year, or $1.2 billion over ten years, to the overall cost of the program. This is {{compared}} to the old program that would have cost $7.2 billion over ten years. The Association for Neighborhood Housing and Development, an interest group that advocated for non-profits and affordable housing groups, claimed that the city needed that extra money to make up for expected cuts in federal funding to the city over the next year, and that luxury development companies <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay full taxes on the property, not get a deduction. Meanwhile, Democratic State Senator Gustavo Rivera claimed that the rents would not be low enough for residents in his Bronx state senate district {{to take advantage of the}} program. Senator Brad Hoylman stated that the dollars devoted to the 421-a program should instead go directly to creating affordable housing.|$|E
25|$|If {{it should}} be {{declared}} that contraception is not evil in itself, then we <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> concede frankly that the Holy Spirit {{had been on the}} side of the Protestant churches in 1930 (when the encyclical Casti Connubii was promulgated), in 1951 (Pius XII's address to the midwives), and in 1958 (the address delivered before the Society of Hematologists in the year the pope died). It should likewise have to be admitted that for a half century the Spirit failed to protect Pius XI, Pius XII, and a large part of the Catholic hierarchy from a very serious error. This would mean that the leaders of the Church, acting with extreme imprudence, had condemned thousands of innocent human acts, forbidding, under pain of eternal damnation, a practice which would now be sanctioned. The fact can neither be denied nor ignored that these same acts would now be declared licit on the grounds of principles cited by the Protestants, which popes and bishops have either condemned or at least not approved.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} economic analyst {{of law is}} 1991 Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase, whose first major article, The Nature of the Firm (1937), argued {{that the reason for}} the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of transaction costs. Rational individuals trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, The Problem of Social Cost (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of a nuisance case named Sturges v Bridgman, where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> move. Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor {{had to put up with}} it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of transaction costs may prevent this. So the law ought to pre-empt what would happen, and be guided by the most efficient solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe. Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{there had}} been a {{rebellion}} in Gaul led by Sacrovir and Florus, Gauls with Roman citizenship, but the rebellion was settled by Gaius Silius (commander of the legions of the Lower Rhine) without the intervention of Tiberius or Drusus. After praising the loyalty of the legions in Gaul, Tiberius defended the statement he had made in 14, that neither he or Drusus <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> [...] "quit the capital" [...] in response to every minor revolt in the empire.|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer's Chris Schilling {{commented that}} {{although}} Ancient Trader {{was not as}} comprehensive and expansive as other Xbox Live titles such as , it deserved [...] "the opportunity {{to do business with}} the big boys rather than risk getting washed away with the shovelware tide". Schilling expressed concern that [...] "a game so elegant and accomplished <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be dredged up from the depths of Indie Games". Lorenzo Fantoni from Eurogamer Italy awarded Ancient Trader the same score as Schilling, and explained that [...] "the final result is a quite simple title, which will last long enough to make you feel happy of having invested your money in this indie title".|$|E

500|$|Producing {{the first}} video {{proved to be}} a {{difficult}} task for Jackson. State authorities unsuccessfully tried to ban the singer filming in Salvador (Pelourinho) and in Rio de Janeiro. Officials in the state of Rio feared images of poverty might affect tourism and accused Jackson of exploiting the poor. Ronaldo Cezar Coelho, the state secretary for Industry, Commerce and Tourism demanded editing rights over the finished product, stating, [...] "I don't see why we <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> facilitate films that will contribute nothing to all our efforts to rehabilitate Rio's image". Some were concerned that scenes of poverty and human rights abuses would affect their chances of hosting the Olympics in 2004. Others supported Jackson's wish to highlight the problems of the region, arguing that the government were embarrassed by their own failings.|$|E
500|$|However, {{seven of}} the judges {{endorsed}} the express limitation that a statute extending the life of Parliament beyond five years could not be passed using the Parliament Acts; a further five agreed with Lord Nicholls that the House of Commons could not [...] "do indirectly by two stages what the House [...] do directly in one stage" [...] by using the Parliament Acts to remove the express limitation and then enact legislation extending the life of Parliament, a restriction that was considered necessary to ensure {{the effectiveness of the}} express limitation. Lord Bingham was the only judge to explicitly reject the validity of this implied limitation, arguing that there were no reasons for preventing the alteration of the clause limiting the subject matter of full Acts of Parliament and that [...] "it cannot have been contemplated that if, however improbably, the Houses found themselves in irreconcilable deadlock on this point, the government <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> resort to the creation of peers".|$|E

[...] She ended with: [...] "It's convoluted. Frankly no one <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> think {{that hard to}} keep up with the Joes." [...] Another negative review came from Variety Magazines Justin Chang, who ridiculed the movie's large-scale destruction of foreign cities, writing: [...] "Audiences who thrilled to the sight of Paris under biochemical attack in Cobra will be pleased to watch London endure an even more horrific fate here, although the sequence is tossed off in quick, almost ho-hum fashion, with no time to dwell on anything so exquisitely crass as the spectacle of the Eiffel Tower collapsing." [...] He summarized the movie as [...] "a more straight-faced brand of idiocy than its cheerfully dumb 2009 predecessor." ...|$|E
