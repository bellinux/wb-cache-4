40|$|An {{effective}} adaptive {{strategy for}} reducing climate change risks and increasing agro-system resiliency is broadening cropping system diversity, heightening {{the flexibility of}} cultivation and tillage methods. Climate change impacts on standard cultivation practices such as mineralisation and nitrate leaching due to mild and rainy winters, as well as frequent drought or water saturation, not only limiting fieldwork days, but also restricting ploughing. This calls for alternative methods to counteract these propensities. From 2010 to 2013, a farming system experiment was conducted on a distinctly heterogeneous organic farm in Brandenburg, Germany. With the intention of devising a more varied and flexible winter wheat cultivation method, standard organic farming practices (winter wheat cultivation {{after two years of}} alfalfa-clover-grass and ploughing in mid-October) were compared to four alternative test methods, which were then evaluated for their robustness and suitability as adaptive strategies. Two of the alternative methods, early sowing and catch crop, entailed moving up the date for alfalfa-clover-grass tilling to July. Instead of a plough, a ring-cutter was used to shallowly (8 cm) cut through and mix the topsoil. In the early sowing test method, winter wheat was sown at the end of August, after repeated ring-cutter processing. With the catch crop method, winter wheat seeding followed a <b>summer</b> <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> and October tillage. The two oat methods (oat/plough; oat/ring-cutter) entailed sowing winter wheat in September, following oat cultivation. Overall, the cultivation methods demonstrated the following robustness gradation: standard practice = catch crop ≥ early sowing > oat/plough > oat/ring-cutter. When compared to standard procedures, the catch crop and early sowing test methods showed no remarkable difference in grain yields. Measured against early sowing, the catch crop test method was significantly more robust when it came to winterkill, quality loss, and weed infestation (40 % lower weed-cover). High N min- values (up to 116 kg N ha - 1) in autumn could have caused the chamomile and thistle infestation in both oat/plough oat/ring-cutter test methods, which led to crop failure in the hollows. Compared to standard practices, the oat ring-cutter test method brought in over 50 % less grain yield. This was attributed to ring-cutter processing, which reduced N mineralisation and caused high weed infestation. However, the ring-cutter effectively regulated alfalfa-clover-grass fields in both exceedingly wet and very dry weather; a temporal flexibility which increases the number of fieldwork days. The catch crop and early sowing test methods contributed most to boosting future agronomic diversity...|$|E

The effect of <b>summer</b> <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> was compared to FYM applied at the rate of 40 t·ha- 1. The <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> biomass (roots + above ground parts) and FYM were incorporated in the third decade of October. Sweet corn seeds (6 kg·ha- 1) were sown in mid-May, in the years 2005 - 2007, at the between – and in-ter-row spacing of 65 × 20 cm. Sweet corn ears were hand-harvested at the stage of milk maturity of kernels, at the turn of August and Septem-ber. During the harvest marketable yield of ears (t·ha- 1) and number of marketable ears per 1 ha were determined. Economic evaluation of sweet corn cultivation under diversified organic fertilization was conducted ac-cording to the standard gross margin method. The calculation was based on the 2014 prices.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to explore the possibility to use clover <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> instead of ryegrass in organic crop production on coarse sand. Two field experiments were performed, which included different animal manure regimes and different soil K- and N-levels. The residual effect of the clover <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> on the yields of a succeeding spring barley test crop was significantly higher than for the ryegrass. When animal manure (70 kg total-N ha- 1) was added to the succeeding spring barley in the ryegrass system the difference between the clover and ryegrass <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> disappeared. Thus clover appeared to have the potential for substituting animal manure. Leaching of nitrate-N and K were estimated by means of porous ceramic suction cups installed at 0. 8 m depth. The annual N leaching from a spring barley reference treatment without <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were approximately 100 kg ha- 1. Clover and ryegrass <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> reduced the losses significantly by 40 to about 80 % depending on the year, and {{there were no significant differences}} between the two <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> types. However, there was a tendency to higher N-leaching losses after clover. Both the clover and ryegrass <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> reduced the annual flow-weighted nitrate concentrations from 13 - 16 mg L- 1 to 5 - 8 mg L- 1, which is below the WHO maximum for drinking water.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{perennial}} ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and their short- and long-term effects on nitrogen leaching and nitrogen turnover in soils. Results are presented from three field experiments on a sandy soil in south-west Sweden, where undersown <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> {{were used in}} cropping systems with and without applications of liquid manure. The effects of different tillage practices on soil mineral nitrogen and leaching were also studied. Two coupled simulation models, which describe water flow and nitrogen transformations and transport in soil, were used for calculations of nitrogen mineralization and soil nitrogen balances. A more detailed study of the residual effects of ryegrass on the nitrogen supyly to the subsequent crops and nitrogen leaching was performed in lysimeters, using 'N-labelled ryegrass. Undersown <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> efficiently reduced nitrogen losses when mineral fertilizer or manure was applied at normal rates (90 - 1 10 kg Nha). Over five years, undersown <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> reduced nitrogen leaching by 60 %, on average, compared with soil which was conventionally tilled in August-September. Incorporation of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> affected nitrogen mineralization mainly during the first growing season following incorporation, when approximately 20 - 30 % of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> nitrogen was released. The results {{emphasize the importance of}} an early onset of nitrogen mineralization in spring after incorporation of <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> This is necessary in order to overcome the soil-depletion effect of nitrogen uptake induced by the <b>catch</b> <b>crop.</b> Simulations showed that incorporation of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> material in late autumn instead of spring can result in a time distribution of nitrogen mineralization more suitable for a subsequent cereal crop, but this was not verified by the results of the lysimeter experiment. It seems important to obtain further knowledge of how to improve the degree of synchronization between nitrogen mineralization after incorporation of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and nitrogen demand of the subsequent crops. According to simulations, {{the main part of the}} <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> nitrogen contributed to a long-term accumulation of soil organic nitrogen (+I 0 kg N per hectare and year), while it slowly declined in autumn-tilled soil given mineral fertilizer (- 30 kg N per hectare and year).

Our second aim was to study the effects of various <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> on the yield and nutrient status of a succeeding organic carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus L.) crop. Our results show differing capabilities of various <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> species in producing above-ground biomass and preventing nitrogen leaching. White mustard reached the highest aboveground dry matter yield, 1416 kg/ha, which was higher than that of Italian ryegrass, phacelia and radish. The dry mass of phacelia (933 kg/ha) was also clearly higher than that of Italian ryegrass and radish, which yielded only 291 kg/ha and 277 kg/ha, respectively. Mustard, phacelia and Italian ryegrass could prevent autumnal nitrogen leaching by 40 – 49 kg/ha.

Legume <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were compared with non-legume <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> in systems with spring barley as the main crop each year. Grain yields were determined and N leaching losses measured by means of installed ceramic suction cups. The legume <b>catch</b> <b>crops,</b> especially white clover and red clover, showed large residual effects in succeeding spring barley, and clover was efficient in reducing N leaching losses. A clover <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> had the potential to replace animal manure but attention should be paid to the risk for poor growth in soil recently cropped to clover...|$|R

It is not always possible to use farmyard manure due to economic, production or technical reasons. <b>Catch</b> <b>crops</b> used as green manures can be an alternative source of organic matter. The experiment {{was carried out in}} central-east Poland (52 ° 06 ’N, 22 ° 55 ’E), in years 2008 – 2011. The successive effect of winter <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (hairy vetch, white clover, winter rye, Italian ryegrass, winter turnip rape) and the type of weed control on the growth and yielding of sweet corn was examined. The <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were sown in early September, incorporated in early May. The effect of the winter <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> on yield was compared to the effect of FYM at a rate of 30 t·ha - 1 and the control without organic manuring. The sweet corn was grown directly after organic fertilization. Three methods of weed control was used: Hw – hand weeding, twice during the growing period, GCM – herbicide Guardian CompleteMix 664 SE, immediately after sowing the seed corn, Z+T – a mixture of herbicides Zeagran 340 SE + Titus 25 WG, in the 3 – 4 leaf stage sweet corn. The highest yields of biomass were found for winter rye (35. 5 t·ha - 1 FM and 7. 3 t·ha - 1 DM), the most of macroelements accumulated winter turnip rape (480. 2 kg N+P+K+Ca+Mg·ha- 1). Generally, leguminous <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> had similar to the FYM and better than non-leguminous <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> yield-forming effect. The highest yield of marketable ears of sweet corn was obtained after FYM (14. 4 t·ha - 1) and after hairy vetch <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> (14. 0 t·ha - 1). A similar yield-forming effect also had white clover and Italian ryegrass. The most of ears from 1 ha was achieved after white clover <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> (59. 3 tausend), similar after FYM and hairy vetch <b>catch</b> <b>crop.</b> The highest kernel yields were found after FYM (10. 7 t·ha - 1).

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nitrogen}} (N) availability related to fertilizer type, <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> management, and rotation composition on cereal yield and grain N were investigated in four organic and one conventional cropping systems in Denmark using the FASSET model. The four-year rotation studied was: spring barley–(faba bean or grass-clover) – potato–winter wheat. Experiments were done at three locations {{representative of the}} different soil types and climatic conditions in Denmark. The three organic systems that included faba bean as the N fixing crop comprised a system with manure (stored pig slurry) and undersowing <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (OF+C+M), a system with manure but without undersowing <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (OF−C + M), and a system without manure and with <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (OF + C−M). A grass-clover green manure was used asNfixing crop in the other organic system with <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (OG+C+M). Cuttings of grass-clover {{were removed from the}} plots and an equivalent amount of total-N in pig slurry was applied to the cropping system. The conventional rotation included mineral fertilizer and <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (CF+C+F), although only non-legume <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were used. Measurements of cereal dry matter (DM) at harvest and of grain N contents were done in all plots. On average the FASSET model was able to predict the yield and grain N of cereals with a reasonable accuracy for the range of cropping systems and soil types studied, having a particularly good performance on winter wheat. Cereal yields were better on the more loamy soil. DM yield and grain N content were mainly influenced by the type and amount of fertilizer-N at all three locations. Although a <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> benefit in terms of yield and grain N was observed in most of the cases, a limited N availability affected the cereal production in the four organic systems. Scenario analyses conducted with the FASSET model indicated the possibility of increasing N fertilization without significantly affecting N leaching if there is an adequate <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> management. This would also improve yields of cereal production of organic farming in Denmark...|$|R

This study focused on the yields of spring oats and spring barley in systems with and without manure in two different cropping systems that differed {{in the proportion of}} legume-based <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (O 2 lower and O 4 higher) and in the rotation composition (grass-clover green manure in O 2 and pulse crops in O 4). Three consecutive four-year crop rotations were established at three locations representative of the different soil types (loamy sand, sandy loam and coarse sand) and climatic conditions. Crop management and soil operations were performed following common practices in organic farming. Measurements of dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N) content of grain cereals at harvest, aboveground biomass in <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and green manure crops in autumn and of the green manure crop at the first cutting were performed. The effect of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> on grain yield varied with cereal and <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> species, soil and rotation type, and the application of N in manure.

40|$|In {{maritime}} climates {{the production}} of winter wheat often leads to high nitrate leaching losses. In this study mixtures of winter wheat and <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were analyzed as alternative growing system to avoid high leaching losses. In a field experiment pure winter wheat grown as control showed highest N-losses. Leaching losses of 140 kg N ha- 1 after the pre-crop grass-clover and of 50 kg N ha- 1 after oats as pre-crop were measured. Compared to this, growing winter wheat in mixture with forage rape or oats reduced nitrate leaching by 50 %. Common vetch as mixture partner to winter wheat had a lower potential to reduce leaching losses. Comparable results were obtained growing the <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> alone followed by spring wheat. Due to the competition for growth factors between <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and cereal, yields of the tested mixtures were {{lower than those of}} spring wheat grown after <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> {{as well as of the}} winter wheat control.

The <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were grown at six field sites, where the perennial species were under-sown with barley and the annual species were after-sown following barley harvest. Biomass production, P content in above-ground and below-ground plant parts and content of available P in the soil were determined in autumn and survival rate of the <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> in the following spring. Biomass production and P retention in autumn both differed significantly between species (p < 0. 0001), and were greatly affected by site-specific conditions and time of sowing, which differed between experiments.
