5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{although}} these {{are hard to}} obtain. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 23 days to germinate. Cuttings yield unpredictable results. The plant itself prefers a deep, sandy, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0–7.0. It requires full sun, but some protection from the wind is recommended, as this is a fast-growing plant with <b>spindly</b> branches that are easily damaged by wind. A more compact form {{can be obtained by}} pruning the top quarter each year. This species has little appeal to the cut flower industry because of its prickly foliage, and its tendency to drip nectar.|$|E
5|$|In Northland, C.australis shows a {{great deal}} of genetic diversity—suggesting it is where old genetic lines have endured. Some trees in the far north have floppy, narrow leaves, which {{botanist}} Philip Simpson attributes to hybridisation with C.pumilio, the dwarf cabbage tree. In eastern Northland, C.australis generally has narrow, straight dark green leaves, but some trees have much broader leaves than normal and may have hybridised with the Three Kings cabbage tree, C.obtecta, which grows at North Cape and on nearby islands. These obtecta-like characteristics appear in populations of C.australis along parts of the eastern coastline from the Karikari Peninsula to the Coromandel Peninsula. In western Northland and Auckland, a form often called tītī grows. When young, tītī are generally very <b>spindly,</b> and are common in young kauri forests. When growing in the open, tītī can become massive trees with numerous, long thin branches and relatively short, broad leaves.|$|E
5|$|Portia fimbriata, {{sometimes}} called the fringed jumping spider, is a jumping spider (family Salticidae) found in Australia and Southeast Asia. Adult females have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. Both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("fangs"), a brown underside, dark brown palps with white hairs, and dark brown abdomens with white spots on the upper side. Both sexes have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair, and the legs are <b>spindly</b> and fringed. However, specimens from New Guinea and Indonesia have orange-brown carapaces and yellowish abdomens. In all species of the genus Portia, the abdomen distends when the spider is well fed or producing eggs.|$|E
5|$|Set reveals to the Resistance {{that the}} Nazis' {{discovery}} {{of one of}} the Da'at Yichud caches, which included advanced technology centuries ahead of its time, is what allowed Germany to surpass the Allies in military might and ultimately win the war. Set agrees to assist the Resistance by revealing the location of one such cache, but states that the Resistance requires a U-boat to access it. Blazkowicz obtains a U-boat, but discovers that it is the flagship of the Nazis' submarine fleet, and is equipped with a cannon designed to fire nuclear warheads, which requires codes from the Nazi lunar research facility to operate. Blazkowicz uses the technology found in the Da'at Yichud cache, namely the <b>Spindly</b> Torque—a sphere that destroys the super-concrete—to steal the identity of a Nazi Lunar scientist and infiltrate the Lunar Base. He succeeds at obtaining the codes, but upon returning to earth, he discovers that Deathshead has mounted an assault on the Resistance base, capturing some of the members.|$|E
5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not stalk but {{displays}} by moving quickly and smoothly, and displays at 4 to 27centimetres away. It raises its legs, its body sways from side to side, and the palps are lowered below the chelicerae ("fangs"). This {{is very different from}} the stalking it uses when encountering another salticid of a different species, despite receiving the same visual stimulus, the sight of the other's large anterior-median eyes. Although P. fimbriata is influenced by pheromones much more than is usual among salticids, visual cues alone are enough to start displays and distinguish members of the same species from other salticids, even if neither partner moves. The <b>spindly,</b> fringed legs of Portia species may identify members of the same species, as well as concealing these spiders from other salticid species.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of generations, the cheela come to worship the humans' {{spacecraft}} as a god, and their records of its satellites' movements cause them to develop writing. Several generations later, the cheela build an arena to accommodate thousands of worshippers. The humans notice this novel and very regular feature, conclude that intelligent beings inhabit the star, and use a laser to send simple messages. Cheela astronomers gradually realize that these are diagrams of the spaceships, its satellites and its crew – impossibly <b>spindly</b> creatures, who communicate with frustrating slowness, and are apparently almost 10% {{as long as the}} cheela's great arena. A cheela engineer proposes to send messages to the humans. As her attempts to transmit from the civilization's territory are ineffective, she travels to a mountain range to transmit directly under the spacecraft – conquering the fear of heights that is instinctive for flattened creatures living in 67billion g. The humans recognize her message and realize that the cheela live a million times faster than humans.|$|E
5|$|The Resistance use {{the nuclear}} codes and the <b>Spindly</b> Torque {{to mount an}} assault on Deathshead's compound. Rescuing the {{captured}} resistance prisoners and evacuating them, Blazkowicz {{makes it to the}} top of the tower, struggling to Deathshead's workshop. Inside, Deathshead greets Blazkowicz, revealing to him that he possesses the brain of the soldier that Blazkowicz chose to die, and puts it in a robot. The robot comes alive and assaults Blazkowicz, who defeats it and puts his friend to rest by destroying the brain. Commandeering a larger robot mecha, Deathshead then attacks Blazkowicz, who gets the upper hand and destroys the robot, dragging Deathshead out of it. He repeatedly stabs Deathshead, who pulls out a grenade which explodes, killing Deathshead and mauling Blazkowicz. As a gravely wounded Blazkowicz crawls towards a window, he mentally recites The New Colossus as he watches the Resistance survivors boarding a helicopter, alongside Anya and Set. Seeing that they have reached safety, and bleeding heavily from his injuries, Blazkowicz orders the Resistance to fire the nuclear cannon. After the credits, a helicopter is heard approaching.|$|E
25|$|Chamberlain: The door keeper for King Balor. The {{creature}} is long, gangly, eight {{feet tall and}} wears silk and velvet robes. It also has long, <b>spindly</b> fingers, which filmmakers mobilized with servos and which Jones wore as extensions of his own hands.|$|E
25|$|Breed {{standards}} describe Doberman Pinschers as dogs of medium-large size with {{a square}} build and short coat. They are compactly built and athletic with endurance and swiftness. The Doberman Pinscher {{should have a}} proud, watchful, determined, and obedient temperament. The dog was originally intended as a guard dog, so males should have a masculine, muscular, noble appearance. Females are thinner, but should not be <b>spindly.</b>|$|E
25|$|The terrain crossed by {{the railway}} was {{exceptionally}} {{difficult because of}} the number of north-south valleys intersecting the route. Because of the extreme shortage of money when the railway was being built, Brunel designed timber trestle viaducts; these were much cheaper but they incurred heavy maintenance costs and were eventually reconstructed in masonry or brick, or in a few cases made into embankments. The <b>spindly</b> appearance of these high viaducts made passengers nervous, but they provided a marked impression associated with the line (although Brunel did use the form of construction elsewhere). The shortage of money at construction also forced the company to install single track only.|$|E
25|$|Yeast dynein {{can walk}} along microtubules without detaching, however in metazoans, cytoplasmic dynein must be {{activated}} by the binding of dynactin, another multisubunit protein {{that is essential}} for mitosis, and a cargo adaptor. The tri-complex, which includes dynein, dynactin and a cargo adaptor, is ultra-processive and can walk long distances without detaching {{in order to reach}} the cargo's intracellular destination. Cargo adaptors identified thus far include BicD2, Hook3, FIP3 and <b>Spindly.</b> The light intermediate chain, which {{is a member of the}} Ras superfamily, mediates the attachment of several cargo adaptors to the dynein motor. The other tail subunits may also help facilitate this interaction as evidenced in a low resolution structure of dynein-dynactin-BicD2.|$|E
500|$|Several claims abound that Lincoln's {{health was}} declining before the assassination. These are {{often based on}} {{photographs}} appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting. One such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder, MEN2b, which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma, mucosal neuromas and a Marfanoid appearance. Others simply claim he had Marfan syndrome, based on his tall appearance with <b>spindly</b> fingers, and the association of possible aortic regurgitation, which can cause bobbing of the head (DeMusset's sign)– based on blurring of Lincoln's head in photographs, which back then had a long exposure time. [...] , DNA analysis was being refused by the Grand Army of the Republic museum in Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|All {{characters}} in Phineas and Ferb were drawn in a design borrowed from Tex Avery's style, with geometric shapes being included in their structure; Phineas {{in particular is}} that of a triangle. The triangle face has been stated in the series as being just his nose that covers the entire head. The goal while drawing characters was to make them simple enough to be drawn by child viewers and be recognized by silhouette. Phineas's eyes lie {{on the top of his}} head and are of oval shape. For his hair, three [...] "tufts" [...] are put in the back and front, while three freckles lie underneath. For the ear, a small 3 is used to represent the ear lobe. Povenmire uses thin, <b>spindly</b> arms for every character as a simple reason to add fun.|$|E
500|$|Denny was {{appointed}} Attorney-General of South Australia and Minister controlling the Northern Territory on 3 June 1910. After conducting {{negotiations with the}} Commonwealth Government, he relinquished his ministerial responsibility for the Northern Territory on 31 December 1910, when its administration {{was transferred to the}} Commonwealth. During his time as Attorney-General, Denny drafted and led several important legislative reforms. These included the Advances for Homes Act 1910, which allowed for 80 per cent of the value of a property to be advanced to a worker at 4.5 per cent interest over 36.5 years. In his speeches Denny highlighted that many workers were faced with high rents and poor conditions. He also sponsored the Female Law Practitioners Act 1911, which enabled women to practice law in South Australia for the first time. Tall, with [...] "long, <b>spindly</b> legs", Denny was a favourite of cartoonists.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Time Beetle", {{which was}} {{responsible}} for the creation of the alternate universe, was described in the episode's script as [...] "a huge black beetle... shiny carapace, <b>spindly</b> black legs moving and flexing, mandibles clacking together". Its design was influenced by the Giant Spider of Metebelis 3 that clung to Sarah Jane Smith's back in Planet of the Spiders. The beetle's normal Earth-like appearance was deliberate; prosthetic designer Niell Gorton thought that familiarity would ease the narrative and cited the cat nuns from [...] "New Earth" [...] and the Judoon from [...] "Smith and Jones" [...] as examples. The prosthetic was made using fibreglass and fitted on a harness in order not to burden Catherine Tate's performance. The episode's director Graeme Harper explained in the episode's commentary that only psychic characters such as Lucius from [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] were aware of the beetle's existence.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} acclaim from critics. [...] James Montgomery of MTV News {{said of the}} song, [...] "there {{are moments}} on Stairs that stop you dead in your tracks, send shivers up your spine and make you go 'Whoa'... like the first four-and-a-half minutes of 'I Will Possess Your Heart,' a propulsive whirl of stalking bass line, <b>spindly</b> guitars and stabbing piano." [...] Will Hermes noted in Rolling Stone that the sense of menace in the song was [...] "playing against type for a guy with one of rock's purest voices—a vibrato-less, bell-clear high tenor whose choirboy quality only throws the darkness here into relief." [...] Blender Jonah Weiner concurred, stating [...] "it's a pleasant surprise to hear Gibbard inhabit such a self-consciously creepy role, rather than play the occasionally errant, essentially good-hearted boyfriend who soft-shoes through {{so many of his}} tales." [...] In 2011, Tyler Kane of Paste included the song in a list of [...] "the 25 creepiest songs about love".|$|E
500|$|This claim {{has been}} criticised as a {{misinterpretation}} of how typefaces are actually measured and what printing methods are desirable. Monotype Garamond, the version bundled with Windows, has a generally smaller design {{at the same}} notional point size compared to Times New Roman and quite <b>spindly</b> strokes, giving it a more elegant but less readable appearance. To make letters, especially the lower-case, as high as in an equivalent setting of Times New Roman, the text size must be increased, counterbalancing any cost savings. Thomas Phinney, an expert on digital fonts, noted {{that the effect of}} simply swapping Garamond in would be compromised legibility: [...] "any of those changes, swapping to a font that sets smaller at the same nominal point size, or actually reducing the point size, or picking a thinner typeface, will reduce the legibility of the text. That seems like a bad idea, as the percentage of Americans with poor eyesight is skyrocketing." [...] Professional font designer Jackson Cavanaugh commented [...] "If we're actually interested in reducing waste, just printing less – using less paper – is obviously more efficient." ...|$|E
500|$|Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter {{felt that}} the film was satisfying, {{explaining}} that Webb directed with emotional and comedic touches and provided a darker depiction and a stronger romance than the original. Boyd Van Hoeija of Variety described the film as a [...] "mostly slick, entertaining and emotionally involving recombination of fresh and familiar elements". A columnist of The Village Voice, Chris Pakham {{felt that the}} film was faithful to the comics and that [...] "Garfield's <b>spindly</b> physicality evokes the Marvel illustrations of the 1960s." [...] Conversely, Lou Lemenick of the New York Post wrote that the film was dull and uninspiring and felt {{that it did not}} compare to Batman Begins and was [...] "a pointless rehash in the mode of Superman Returns." [...] New Yorker critic Anthony Lane described the film as [...] "running out of nimbleness and fun, and the promise contained in its title seems ever more tendentious." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called the film [...] "memorable in pieces but not as a whole" [...] and said that its best element is the relationship between Peter and Gwen, while the Lizard [...] "is not quite an opponent for the ages." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{returning}} monsters, the Ice Warriors were not heavily redesigned. Gatiss insisted upon keeping {{the fundamentals of}} the original and Moffat explained that the original design was not well-known enough to put a new spin on it, and so Skaldak's shell is just a [...] "super-version of the original". Of the original design, Millennium FX's Neill Gorton said, [...] "My problem with the old ones is they had Lego hands and weird, <b>spindly</b> arms but a bulky body and these strange saddlebag hips, almost feminine. They had fur sticking out everywhere. So all of that together didn't suggest [...] "ice warriors." [...] They should be much beefier and stronger. We gave it more of a bodybuilder physique, changed the hands and styled the body {{to make it look}} more like armour-plating, even though it's reptilian." [...] The costume was made of flexible urethane rubber instead of the fibreglass like the original, as it would damage less easily and be more comfortable to wear. The costume was made to specially fit Spencer Wilding. Though only some of the Skaldak's real appearance was shown on-screen, Gorton stated that they created a full animatronic body.|$|E
500|$|The video—which cost an {{estimated}} $140,000 to produce—was completed while Kiedis and Frusciante {{were on a}} promotional trip through Europe in support of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. When the vocalist first saw it, he was [...] "more hysterically ecstatic about that piece of visual footage than anything [...] ever done." [...] Warner Bros. executives, however, were worried that the content would be [...] "too weird" [...] or [...] "too artsy" [...] {{for the general public}} and favored a more traditional premise in contrast to the experimental approach Sednaoui took. The video was ultimately released without being edited by the record label; since then it has been widely credited as being a considerable factor in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' success and greatly increased their international popularity. Journalist Jeff Apter noted the video's [...] "funky brew of goofy looks, a subtle invasive hook, Flea's <b>spindly</b> fingered baseline and Kiedis' crotch-hugging shorts made the clip essential viewing across MTV throughout the last few months of 1991." [...] Steve Huey of Allmusic commented in his review of the song that [...] "MTV jumped all over the visually distinctive video." [...] It was nominated for three awards—"Best Alternative Video", [...] "Breakthrough Video", and [...] "Best Art Direction"—at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, for which it won the latter two.|$|E

2500|$|MTV chose [...] "We Found Love" [...] as {{the third}} best song of 2011, and [...] "Video of the Year" [...] at the MTV Video Music Awards 2012. The writers of the website further commented, [...] "The leadoff single from Talk That Talk is where Rihanna fully embraced EDM. Produced by Calvin Harris, 'We Found Love' is a {{swirling}} party track about love and loss, the rare song that manages to be sad and joyous all at once. And it is a pinnacle of the pop/dance crossover, a throwback to '90s raves that could make even the most stoic lover of pop want to break out a glow stick and just dance. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone put [...] "We Found Love" [...] at number eleven on his list of Top 25 Songs of 2011 commenting, [...] "While her other hits tried to camouflage her <b>spindly</b> voice, here it just strains for that <b>spindly</b> melody."

2500|$|New spear and shield. Shaka is {{credited}} with introducing a new variant of the traditional weapon, discarding the long, <b>spindly</b> throwing weapon and instituting a heavy, shorter stabbing spear, the iKlwa. The spear was wielded underhand, on {{the manner of the}} Roman sword. He is also said to have introduced a larger, heavier cowhide shield, and trained his forces to use them both in closing quickly [...] with the enemy in more effective hand-to-hand combat. Local skirmishers used to tossing their spears and pulling back would be confronted by an aggressive force closing for the kill. None of these weapons changes are spectacular in the local context, but mated to an aggressive mobility and tactical organisation, they were to make a devastating impact.|$|E

Albini would set off a brick of firecrackers onstage before the band played, a tradition he carried on from their earliest performances through their dissolution and revived for their 2006 reunion set, and would count in most songs by yelling [...] "One, two, fuck you!" [...] While playing, the band members would slam their hands against their steel guitar strings so hard that they would draw blood, often needing to put adhesive bandages on their fingers. Albini used a specially-made hip-slung guitar strap worn around his waist like a belt, and would [...] "prowl the stage like a <b>spindly</b> gunslinger", according to Azerrad.

He then attended the Los Alamos Ranch School in New Mexico, which was stressful for him. The school was a boarding school for the wealthy, [...] "where the <b>spindly</b> sons of the rich could be transformed into manly specimens". Burroughs kept journals documenting an erotic attachment to another boy. According to his own account, he destroyed these later, ashamed of their content. He kept his sexual orientation concealed from his family well into adulthood, due to {{the context in which}} he grew up and from which he fled—that is, a [...] "family where displays of affection were considered embarrassing". He became a well-known homosexual writer after the publication of Naked Lunch in 1959.

2500|$|The black-necked stork {{is a large}} bird, [...] tall {{having a}} [...] wingspan. The average weight is around [...] The plumage {{patterns}} are conspicuous with younger birds differing from adults. Adults have a glossy bluish-black iridescent head, neck, secondary flight feathers and tail; a coppery-brown crown; a bright white back and belly; bill black with a slightly concave upper edge; and bright red legs. The sexes are identical but the adult female has a yellow iris while the adult male has it brown. Juveniles younger than six months have a brownish iris; a distinctly smaller and straighter beak; a fluffy appearance; brown head, neck, upper back, wings and tail; a white belly; and dark legs. Juveniles older than six months have a mottled appearance especially {{on the head and}} neck where the iridescence is partly developed; dark-brown outer primaries; white inner primaries that forms a shoulder patch when the wings are closed; a heavy beak identical in size to adults but still straighter; and dark to pale-pink legs. Like most storks, the black-necked stork flies with the neck outstretched, not retracted like a heron. In flight it appears <b>spindly</b> and a black bar running through the white wings (the somewhat similar looking migratory black stork has an all black wing) with black neck and tail make it distinctive.|$|E
2500|$|The {{town house}} has been {{described}} as having a [...] "flat roofline, rectangular profile and somewhat delicate lintel detail - in addition to neo-classical window spacing and a main facade with <b>spindly</b> belfry steeple". The building has been compared to the Scottish National Library on George IV Bridge in Edinburgh for having a modern style with classical or traditional elements and recognised for Scandinavian influences. The base of the town house features Darney stone from East Woodburn, with the walls being made from Blaxter stone, both of which were brought north to the town from Northumberland quarries. The surroundings of the main entrance are made of Elverwater stone. The stone on the walls was done by retired masons from around the ages of 65 to 80. The clock tower of Nordic influence, which sits on top of the building, complete with a weather vane, shows St Bryce, the patron saint of Kirkcaldy. The unique design was done by David Carr of Edinburgh. A small copper ball, [...] in diameter, {{at the bottom of the}} vane, is supposed to represent the world. The figure is located at the top of the [...] weather vane with the intention he can look across the town as the vane turns around in the wind, with the world at his feet. The vane, probably made of wrought iron, was designed by Thomas Hadden of Edinburgh.|$|E
2500|$|A Chicago house album, Virgos music draws {{elements}} {{from the local}} deep house and acid house styles, and bears influence and similitaries {{with the work of}} Larry Heard, Fingers Inc. and Armando.

However, Virgo has been noted for its idiosyncratic sound, more introspective and dreamy than other mechanically intense styles from its era, Phuture's [...] "Acid Trax" [...] for example. In a 2009 interview, Merwyn Sanders stated: [...] "We were into a lot of classic stuff, Kraftwerk and Gary Numan and a lot of jazz stuff. That’s what I grew up around, listening. My dad was a huge jazz fan, so that was just engrained in my head without me even knowing it. So I guess that’s what you get a little sense of with that album we did." [...] Fact called it a [...] "deep post-acid" [...] album, and wrote that despite being similar to other contemporary house releases, [...] "it stands alone, and its cerebral but generously groovy evocation of the urban nightscape has never been matched for elegance or acuity." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described it as [...] "music you might make the day after a drugged-out bacchanal – wistful and contemplative, shot through with a creeping, contagious melancholy." [...] Joe Muggs described Virgo as [...] "archetypal house music through and through: it is design {{as much as it is}} art, absolutely attuned to the proportions and metabolism of the human body in a technological society."

There she stood and sniffed, stretched herself, and thought: 'It's jolly--only, it smells too much!' and she went up to the pictures, one by one. They seemed to go splendidly with the room, and suddenly she felt homesick. Ridiculous, of course! Yet, if she had known where her father's room was, she would have run out to it; but her memory was too tangled up with stairs and corridors--to find her way down to the hall again was all she could have done.|$|E
