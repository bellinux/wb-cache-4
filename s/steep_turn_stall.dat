50|$|The hammerhead <b>turn,</b> <b>stall</b> <b>turn,</b> or Fieseler is an {{aerobatics}} turn-around maneuver.|$|R
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that, {{according}} to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) terminology, the above example illustrates a so-called <b>turning</b> flight <b>stall,</b> while the term accelerated is used to indicate an accelerated <b>turning</b> <b>stall</b> only, that is, a <b>turning</b> flight <b>stall</b> where the airspeed decreases at a given rate.|$|R
50|$|Permitted {{to do the}} {{following}} aerobatic manoeuvres: loop, <b>stall</b> <b>turn,</b> <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> and spin, the Vuk-t is popular in flying clubs because it reminds club members about free flying, the free donation of planes to clubs by the army and general Yugoslavian nostalgia. The majority of surviving Vuk-t gliders fly with aero-clubs with few aircraft in private ownership and are expected to have a long life due to the high structural strength and ease of maintenance.|$|R
50|$|A <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> in aviation, {{performed}} by an aircraft (usually fixed wing), is a turn that involves {{a bank of}} more than 30 degrees. This means the angle created by the axis running along both wings and the horizon is more than 30 degrees. Generally, for training purposes, <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> are demonstrated and practiced at 45 degrees, sometimes more. The purpose of learning and practicing a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> is to train a pilot to maintain control of an aircraft in cases of emergency such as structural damage, loss of power in one engine etc.|$|R

50|$|This {{minor planet}} named {{in memory of}} Russian aviator Mikhail Nikiforovich Efimov (М. Н. Ефимов; 1881-1919), {{who was the first}} to realize <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> and dives.|$|R
2500|$|Spin testing entered from level flight, snap {{rolls and}} <b>turning</b> <b>stalls</b> {{failed to produce}} a spin {{condition}} as the WT-11 just mushed to level flight. These tests resulted in the company billing the aircraft as [...] "Won't Spin".|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, {{the number}} of {{aircraft}} in the main formation were increased to six, performing loops in delta formation, barrel roll and <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> in double arrow-head formation.|$|R
5000|$|Intention: execute {{an outside}} loop of 360° with the lateral axis {{vertical}} to the earth. The pilot enters from a hammerhead <b>turn</b> (<b>stall</b> <b>turn)</b> {{and as the}} fuselage reaches knife-edge flight at the top, gives it full down elevator. The result will be the aircraft's pivoting about its wing tip in a perfect pirouette. The throttle is utilised to make the wing remain vertical.|$|R
5000|$|It {{reportedly}} {{came toward}} the island from the east, flew towards the [...] "Pico Desejado" [...] (Wished Peak), made a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> and went away {{very quickly to}} the north-west.|$|R
50|$|A 45 degree bank turn is made {{by placing}} the {{indicator}} equidistant between the 30 and 60 degree marks. A 45 degree bank turn is usually {{referred to as a}} <b>steep</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 23 November 1943: A {{squadron}} aircraft {{crashed on}} the breakwater at Port Lyautey, during a practice depth charge run. The starboard wing tip touched {{the water in}} a <b>steep</b> <b>turn,</b> tearing off the wing. All hands were lost.|$|R
50|$|In 2003 Service Bulletin 315-64/2 {{reduced the}} maximum {{admissible}} airspeeds and prohibited aerobatic flight. This {{was due to}} reports that {{the design of the}} fuselage may not have been sufficient to sustain limit loads during certain maneuvers and during flight at certain speeds. Grob completed further investigations into the effects of certain flight conditions on the fuselage structure and the development of corrective procedures. Further static strength tests were conducted to verify the safety margin of the fuselage. The results of these tests restored the original flight speed limitations and maneuver operations for the Twin II and allowed the Twin II Acro only basic aerobatic maneuvers (spins, lazy eights, chandelles, <b>stall</b> <b>turns,</b> <b>steep</b> <b>turns,</b> and positive loops). An approved modification, when incorporated, restores full acrobatic status to these sailplanes.|$|R
2500|$|Then, on 26 September 1933, he {{took off}} from Baragwanath Airport near Johannesburg, South Africa, flying a de Havilland DH.84 Dragon, {{registration}} ZS-AEF. He stalled out at [...] after making a <b>steep</b> <b>turn.</b> The resulting crash killed him and his passenger, Sir Michael Oppenheimer.|$|R
50|$|The term {{can also}} refer to an {{aircraft}} certified under American, Canadian, European or Australian regulations as a Utility Category Aircraft, {{which indicates that}} it is permitted to conduct limited aerobatics. The approved maneuvers include chandelles, lazy eights, spins and <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> over 60° of bank.|$|R
50|$|The {{service is}} mostly {{operated}} by older rolling stock {{or the new}} Artic units. This is because the difficult portion of track from Töölön tulli to Munkkiniemi is not suited for Variobahn trams due to its <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> and climbs that were built before {{the current generation of}} trams were ordered.|$|R
500|$|... 8,815 Picassos built between January and May 2011 for the UK market were {{recalled}} on 2 September 2011 when it {{was discovered}} that the battery cable was too short and could cause gearbox failures and in <b>turn</b> <b>stall</b> the engine. The faulty earth return cable was replaced. Despite the recalls, the vehicle continued to sell well in the UK and has won numerous awards.|$|R
50|$|This {{applies to}} cockpits with two seats (usually Pilot & Co-Pilot) {{arranged}} horizontally or abreast. Assuming the pilot performing the manoeuvre is positioned {{in the left}} seat (command seat) when a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> to the right is performed, the nose will appear to fall. Conversely, a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> to the left will {{make it seem like}} the nose is rising against the horizon. This is parallax error based purely on the pilot's vantage point and instinctively causes a pull back or a push down reaction on the control stick / column which is an incorrect reaction. A good way of eliminating the effect of this error is {{to keep an eye on}} the horizon and maintain the aircraft's position relative to the horizon line thereby allowing you to approximate the 45 degree angle the panel top creates against the horizon.|$|R
50|$|Maranakatte {{is located}} at a {{distance}} of 16 km from Kundapura on the way to Kollur and the village is also called Kanchinakodlu.There is a Brahmalingeshwara Temple which is located on the banks of river Brahmakunda in the northside which then takes a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> towards east which increases the beauty of the spot.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Illustration of a <b>turning</b> flight <b>stall,</b> {{occurring}} {{during a}} co-ordinated turn with progressively increasing angle of bank.|$|R
50|$|Common {{first steps}} after an EFTO {{would be to}} fly at the best glide speed (VBG), retract flaps if {{airspeed}} permits, unlatch the door, and land straight ahead. Returning to the airport with a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> has a high probability of resulting in a stall or spin. Although it seems counter intuitive, the NTSB has recorded numerous fatal crashes due to this mistake.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, Clapper was {{accepted}} into the Air Force pilot training program at Reese Air Force Base in Lubbock, Texas. The training began with flying Cessna 172s, and then progressed to the T-37, a small twin-engine jet, nicknamed the “Tweety-bird”, because of the high-pitched sound of the engine. Clapper learned to do basic maneuvers, <b>steep</b> <b>turns,</b> and fly in formation.|$|R
50|$|The Adelaide-Crafers Highway {{extension}} came as {{a much-needed}} upgrade and replacement to the previous link road, the Mount Barker Road, which had been contoured to the Adelaide Hills, giving rise to many <b>steep</b> <b>turns,</b> ascending a tortuous route. The tightest hairpin turn on the Mount Barker Road became infamous as 'the Devils Elbow', often the site of car and semi-trailer accidents.|$|R
5000|$|Approach {{conditions}} towards Freeland {{were poor}} {{due to the}} weather; there was restricted visibility, and conditions were ripe for icing. The plane's crew apparently attempted a <b>steep</b> <b>turn</b> to align the craft with the runway. This caused the plane to stall, which {{was followed by a}} spin. [...] The crew could not regain control, leading to the crash of the plane.|$|R
50|$|Three prototypes and 24 {{production}} aircraft were ordered, {{with the first}} of three prototypes flying in April 1917. It was found to have a poor climb performance and handling, with the ailerons being overbalanced, which tended to force the aircraft onto its back in <b>steep</b> <b>turns.</b> To try to solve its handling problems it was fitted with various designs of aileron and rudders.|$|R
50|$|Staircases {{lead from}} the cellar and second story to the rear kitchen wing. It has its {{original}} cooking hearth, complete with crane, and a brick oven that protrudes slightly from the rear wall. A small pantry made from old panel doors and other reused woodwork is in the passageway to the main block. A <b>steep,</b> <b>turning</b> staircase leads up to the garret.|$|R
50|$|A notable {{example of}} air {{accident}} involving a low-altitude <b>turning</b> flight <b>stall</b> is the 1994 Fairchild Air Force Base B-52 crash.|$|R
5|$|Wind shear is also {{a hazard}} for {{aircraft}} making <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> near the ground. It is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan, which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident.|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was very fast but lacking in stability and control. At 150 mph (241 km/h), <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> {{could not be}} made without applying full rudder. Engine overheating occurred during flight tests. The single centrally mounted radiator was replaced by two radiators mounted in the lower inner wings, but the problem was not fully cured. The small size of the cockpit restricted {{the movement of the}} pilot.|$|R
50|$|Since 2011, {{downtown}} {{has played}} host for the Red Bull Crashed Ice event. Crashed Ice is a winter extreme sporting event featuring ice cross downhill (or downhill ice cross) which involves downhill skating {{in an urban}} environment, on a track which includes <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> and high vertical drops. The event coincides with the Saint Paul Winter Carnival and draws crowds of more than 100,000.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} statue {{once found}} on Mt. Radhošť, sculpted in 1929 by Albin Polasek, is now located in Frenstat's (Czech Republic) Town Hall. When the statue {{was moved to}} the mountain in 1931, the truck became stuck in a <b>steep</b> <b>turn,</b> and heavy rain accompanied by storm and lightning killed one of the soldiers. A second cast by Albin Polasek stands in the center of Prague's Zoo.|$|R
50|$|The flight {{took off}} at 06:45am in almost zero {{visibility}} and crashed shortly after, 325 m beyond the runway. At {{an altitude of}} 300 ft, the aircraft had initiated a <b>steep</b> <b>turn.</b> The pilot lost control and the aircraft crashed {{as a result of}} this unusual maneuver plus the crew's loss of situational awareness in the low visibility conditions. All 155 people aboard were killed.|$|R

5000|$|The {{handling}} {{characteristics of the}} Interceptor {{have been described as}} [...] "alarming." [...] In <b>steep</b> <b>turns</b> the elevator became ineffective, and the aircraft was prone to enter a spiral dive or a spin from such flight attitudes. The Mercury II engine suffered from persistent high oil temperatures. Test pilots gave a negative assessment of the Interceptor, causing it to be withdrawn from the F.20/27 competition.|$|R
