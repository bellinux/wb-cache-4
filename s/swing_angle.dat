The first application {{was on the}} VQ37VHR V6 engine of Skyline Coupe (Infiniti G37). Nissan's system is more compact than BMW’s, involving fewer parts and less energy loss, and is therefore more adaptable to high-performance engines. [...] The VVEL does not use a conventional intake camshaft. Each valve is actuated by a cam which is pivoted on - but not fixed to - the camshaft.

Its movement is driven by the camshaft via a series of components. VVEL varies valve lift by the eccentric control shaft inside the rocker arm. By rotating the eccentric control shaft, the position of rocker arm is shifted, changing the <b>swing</b> <b>angle</b> of cam.

In this paper, based on the establishment of the modulation average frame, the vector projection is carried out, and then the attitude conversion matrix and the attitude error matrix mainly including the shaft <b>swing</b> <b>angle</b> and axis non-orthogonal are obtained. Because the attitude angles are given under the static condition, the shaft <b>swing</b> <b>angle</b> and the axis non-orthogonal angle are estimated by the static Kalman filter (KF).

The basis of this new method is to monitor {{the orientation of the}} axis of the induction machine 2 ̆ 7 s magnetic field, and hence compute (estimate) the range of its oscillation due to the above mentioned types of faults in a synchronously rotating frame of reference. Differences in the pendulous oscillations due to broken-bars and inter-turn faults required different signal processing approaches (or algorithms) for detecting the range of the pendulous oscillations, the so-called <b>swing</b> <b>angle</b> indices. Moreover, these algorithms for obtaining the <b>swing</b> <b>angle</b> indices have been developed as practical fault indicators which diagnose effectively these faults even in the presence of some system and measurement noises. Furthermore, these algorithms and techniques have been applied, experimentally tested and investigated {{for a wide range of}} operating conditions, for two quite distinct and different induction motors, whose designs are of two distinct natures, under different load levels and different excitation systems. Using these <b>swing</b> <b>angle</b> indices for rotor broken-bars and stator inter-turn short circuit faults, namely, Δδ 1 and Δδ sc, respectively, the severity of any such fault was effectively evaluated in a much more reliable manner than in case of using more conventional fault indicators such as frequency spectral side bands or negative sequence current/impedance components, etc. Specifically, this characteristic regarding the evaluation of the fault severity is also evaluated by making comparisons between the <b>swing</b> <b>angle</b> indices and the well-known side band component techniques as well as negative sequence current component for the cases of broken bars and inter-turn faults, respectively.
