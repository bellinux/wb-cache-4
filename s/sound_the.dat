5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the <b>sound,</b> <b>the</b> output cannot {{simply be}} {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet.

Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E
