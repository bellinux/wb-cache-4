The discussions are not only how to achieve/argue <b>quality</b> in <b>software</b> products but also how to delimit its definition, because defining the quality is not an easy task for generic use, either. For instance, Reeves and Bednar [] find that defining quality may be achieved when it is specification focused; however the challenge remains as quality is seen/evaluated as "excellence", usually. This argument is also supported in the software domain along with the following attempts to define quality: In addition, there are books (e. g. []), which give complied sets of definitions from a variety of software sub-branches addressing <b>software</b> <b>quality</b> and <b>assurance.</b> Along with those definitions from recent publications we have identified a remarkable overlap on the customer satisfaction and <b>software</b> <b>quality.</b> However, how to generalize customer defined quality keeps itself away from general formulae...|$|R
