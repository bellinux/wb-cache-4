The results show that a greater probability exists of observing a proton event if the observed <b>soft</b> <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> flare has a relatively large decay time. It is {{also found that the}} H-alpha brightening area is a good indicator of the strength of the <b>soft</b> <b>X</b> <b>ray</b> burst.

40|$|The {{hard and}} <b>soft</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> and {{microwave}} emissions from a solar flare (May 14, 1980) were analyzed and interpreted {{in terms of}} Joule heating and runaway electron acceleration {{in one or more}} current sheets. It is found that all three emissions can be generated with sub-Dreicer electric fields. The <b>soft</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> emitting plasma can only be heated by a single current sheet if the resistivity in the sheet is well above the classical, collisional resistivity of 10 (exp 7) K, 10 (exp 11) /cu cm plasma. If the hard x ray emission is from thermal electrons, anomalous resistivity or densities exceeding 3 x 10 (exp 12) /cu cm are required. If the hard x ray emission is from nonthermal electrons, the emissions can be produced with classical resistivity in the current sheets if the heating rate is approximately 4 times greater than that deduced from the <b>soft</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> data (with a density of 10 (exp 10) /cu cm in the <b>soft</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> emitting region), if there are at least 10 (exp 4) current sheets, and if the plasma properties in the sheets are characteristic of the superhot plasma observed in some flares by Lin et al., and with Hinotori.

40|$|The {{exact nature}} of the solar flare process is still {{somewhat}} a mystery. A key element to understanding flares if {{the relationship between the}} hard x rays emitted by the most energetic portions of the flare and the soft x rays from other areas and times. This relationship was studied by comparing hard x ray light curved from the Hard X-Ray Burst Spectrometer (HXRBS) with the <b>soft</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> light curve and its derivation from the Bent Crystal Spectrometer (BCS) {{which is part of the}} X-Ray Polychrometer (XRP), these instruments being on the Solar Maximum Mission spacecraft (SMM). Data sample was taken from flares observed with the above instruments during 1980, the peak of the previous maximum of solar activity. Flares were chosen based on complete coverage of the event by several instruments. The HXRBS data covers the x ray spectrum from about 25 keV to about 440 keV in 15 spectral channels, while the BCS data used covers a region of the Spectrum around 3 angstroms including emission from the Ca XIX ion. Both sets of data were summed over their spectral ranges and plotted against time at a maximum time resolution of around 3 seconds. The most popular theory of flares holds that a beam of electrons produces the hard x rays by bremsstrahlung while the soft x rays are the thermal response to this energy deposition. The question is whether the rate of change of <b>soft</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> emission might reflect the variability of the electron beam and hence the variability of the hard x rays. To address this, we took the time derivative of the <b>soft</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> light curve and compared it to the hard flares, 12 of them showed very closed agreement between the <b>soft</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> derivative and the hard x ray light curve. The other five did not show this behavior but were similar to each other in general <b>soft</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> behavior. Efforts to determine basic differences between the two kinds of flares continue. In addition the behavior of <b>soft</b> <b>x</b> <b>ray</b> temperature of flares was examined...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the response of}} the thermosphere/ionosphere of Mars to enhanced fluxes of solar <b>soft</b> <b>x</b> <b>rays,</b> as have been measured by the SNOE satellite and the SEE instrument on TIMED. We model the Martian upper atmosphere for both high and low solar activities, with fluxes from both Hinteregger and Tobiska. We find that the lower peak in the electron density profile is increased, especially at high solar activity. The odd nitrogen densities in the lower thermosphere are enhanced, but the NO densities remain relatively constant. Only the N densities are significantly larger. Thus larger fluxes of solar <b>soft</b> <b>x</b> <b>rays</b> cannot account for the large NO densities measured by Viking 1 below 140 km, but can account for the often prominent peak seen below the main ionospheric peak by the MGS radio occultation measurements...|$|R

Commercially available, low power (18 mV), low noise, hybrid preamplifiers, were used. These photodiodes were also coupled to CsI(TI) scintillator and obtained about 6 resolution at 662 keV. The photodiode frequency response matches well with the emission spectrum of the CsI(TI) scintillator providing good spectral resolution and a higher signal than NaI(TI) when viewed by conventional photomultipliers.
