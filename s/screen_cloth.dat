50|$|Tensioned <b>screen</b> <b>cloth</b> is {{typically}} 4 feet by the width or {{the length of}} the screening machine depending on whether the deck is side or end tensioned. <b>Screen</b> <b>cloth</b> for tensioned decks can be made with hooks and are attached with clamp rails bolted {{on both sides of the}} screen box. When the clamp rail bolts are tightened, the cloth is tensioned or even stretched in the case of some types of self-cleaning screen media. To ensure that the center of the cloth does not tap repeatedly on the deck due to the vibrating shaker and that the cloth stays tensioned, support bars are positioned at different heights on the deck to create a crown curve from hook to hook on the cloth. Tensioned <b>screen</b> <b>cloth</b> is available in various materials: stainless steel, high carbon steel and oil tempered steel wires, as well as moulded rubber or polyurethane and hybrid screens (a self-cleaning <b>screen</b> <b>cloth</b> made of rubber or polyurethane and metal wires).|$|E

50|$|Stratification - This {{phenomenon}} {{occurs as}} vibration is {{passed through a}} bed of material. This causes coarse (larger) material to rise and finer (smaller) material to descend within the bed.

40|$|Banana screens {{are often}} used for high {{capacity}} separation of iron ore, coal and aggregates into different size fractions. They consist {{of one or more}} curved decks that are fitted with screen panels with arrays of square or rectangular holes. The screen structure is vibrated while a dense stream of particles flows over it and is separated according to size. The material discharging {{from the top of the}} deck is the oversize and may become a coarse product or be crushed and recycled to the screen feed. The material falling through the deck can be further separated by additional decks below. Each lower deck returns a product stream and the material passing out through the bottom deck is the undersize. In this paper, Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to explore the separation performance of a full industrial scale double deck banana screen for a peak acceleration of 5 g. The separation efficiency of each deck is analysed and the individual contributions of each screen panel are assessed using outputs from the model. Residence time distributions for particles on each deck provide insight into both the transport characteristics along the deck and the separation performance through each deck. The top and bottom decks have very different flow behaviour with very different bed structure and motion. The stresses applied by the flowing particles to the <b>screen</b> <b>cloths</b> and the impact and abrasive wear on the screen surfaces are evaluated. Finally, the energy absorbed by particles provides insight into the extent of particle degradation produced by transiting the screen...|$|R

50|$|Self-cleaning {{screen media}} was {{initially}} engineered to resolve <b>screen</b> <b>cloth</b> blinding, clogging and pegging problems. The {{idea was to}} place crimped wires side-by-side on a flat surface, creating openings and then, in some way, holding them together over the support bars (crown bars or bucker bars). This would allow the wires {{to be free to}} vibrate between the support bars, preventing blinding, clogging and pegging of the cloth. Initially, crimped longitudinal wires on self-cleaning cloth were held together over support bars with woven wire. In the 50s, some manufacturers started to cover the woven cross wires with caulking or rubber to prevent premature wear of the crimps (knuckles on woven wires). One of the pioneer products in this category was ONDAP GOMME made by the French manufacturer Giron. During the mid 90s, Major Wire Industries Ltd., a Quebec manufacturer, developed a “hybrid” self-cleaning <b>screen</b> <b>cloth</b> called Flex-Mat, without woven cross wires. In this product, the crimped longitudinal wires are held in place by polyurethane strips. Instead of locking (impeding) the vibration over the support bars with woven cross wires, the polyurethane strips lessens the vibration of the longitudinal wires over the support bars but does not stop it, consequently allowing vibration from hook to hook. Major Wire quickly started to promote this product as a high-performance screen that helped producers screen more in-specification material for less cost and not simply a problem solver. They claimed that the independent vibrating wires helped produce more product compared to a woven wire cloth with the same opening (aperture) and wire diameter. This higher throughput would be {{a direct result of the}} higher vibration frequency of each independent wire of the <b>screen</b> <b>cloth</b> (calculated in hertz) compared to the shaker vibration (calculated in RPM), accelerating the stratification of the material bed. Another benefit that helped the throughput increase is that hybrid self-cleaning screen media offered a better open area percentage than woven wire screen media. Due to its flat surface (no knuckles), hybrid self-cleaning screen media can use a smaller wire diameter for the same aperture than woven wire and still lasts as long, resulting in a greater opening percentage.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, <b>screen</b> <b>cloth</b> {{was made}} with metal wires woven with a loom. Today, woven cloth is still widely used {{primarily}} because they are less expensive than other types of screen media. Over the years, different weaving techniques have been developed; either to increase the open area percentage or add wear-life. Slotted opening woven cloth is used where product shape is not a priority and where users need a higher open area percentage. Flat-top woven cloth is used when the consumer wants to increase wear-life. On regular woven wire, the crimps (knuckles on woven wires) wear out faster {{than the rest of}} the cloth resulting in premature breakage. On flat-top woven wire, the cloth wears out equally until half of the wire diameter is worn, resulting in a longer wear life. Unfortunately flat-top woven wire cloth is not widely used because of the lack of crimps that causes a pronounced reduction of passing fines resulting in premature wear of con crushers.|$|E

40|$|A Smart Screen Systems {{screening}} device {{was installed in}} the pilot plant at the Coleraine Mineral Research Laboratory. As installed, the machine holds one pre-tensioned panel at 25 -degrees from horizontal. Currently, single or two panel machines are available, and can be manufactured at the deck angle required for optimum performance. The effective <b>screen</b> <b>cloth</b> surface area on the pre-tensioned panels was 43 " wide by 34 " long, and the feed stream was distributed evenly along the 43 " wide surface. The panel installation system was very simple, consisting of six cams used to hold an edge bracket onto the panel. A single individual can change a panel {{in just a few}} minutes. The scope of work for this project follows the pattern set in Part 1, in which five tests were completed on each of two feed samples, one from Hibbing Taconite, and one from Northshore Mining. The scope of work for Part 2 also includes silica and magnetic iron assays on head samples as well as on each size fraction. Otherwise, the test plan was identical to the previous part. For each material, initial tests were completed to achieve the established separation criteria as in Part 1. These criteria were to achieve a split at near 100 microns for the Hibbing Taconite material, and to achieve an undersize grade close to 90 % - 325 mesh for the Northshore Mining material. Once the panel was selected and other operating issues were resolved, a formal test sequence was conducted using two values for feed rate and two values of feed solids that were just higher and just lower than in the initial tests. The idea was to bracket the optimum separation and measure the variation in screen performance as these two parameters varied. As seen in Table 1, the four tests were completed in a 2 x 2 pattern, and a fifth test was a repetition of one of the first four in order to measure experimental error.

40|$|The quality {{requirements}} for sand, gravel and crushed rock material used on roads and railroads {{have been raised}} in recent years, hence suppliers must meet more rigorous demands. It is now necessary to improve the understanding of {{all parts of the}} production line. In this project, screens are studied, since they are used widely in the aggregate producing industry. The objective of the research is to develop a physical model that explains the behaviour of a crushed rock material bed on a screen. The model should make it possible to predict the capacity of the screen and the size distribution of both the passed and the remaining material, in order to optimize the screening process. The screen is assumed to have a wire cloth and a circular stroke: this is common at the last stage of the aggregate production process in which the final fractions are produced. Two major processes occur during screening: passage of fine particles through the apertures and stratification. The stratification process probably includes both separation and mixing of particles of different sizes within the material bed on the screen surface. To take into account the size distribution, the material was divided into an arbitrary number of fractions. The properties of the particles within each fraction were assumed to be the same. To model the stratification process, the material bed was separated into multiple layers containing varying proportions of the assorted fractions. For the beginning of the screen, the simplification was made that the fractions were evenly distributed in the bed. The upward and downward flows of each fraction between layers were determined by continuity, the mass flow of a fraction within each layer and two stratification rate parameters. These parameters include the influences of both mixing and separation. The passage of material through the apertures in a <b>screen</b> <b>cloth</b> depends on the mass flow of each fraction close to the screen surface, in a contact layer, and on the passage rate parameters for the fractions. Constitutive relations for the stratification and passage rate parameters were obtained from experiments. The transport velocity of a single particle along a screen was determined by the laws of mechanics. In addition, Monte Carlo simulation was used to reproduce the interaction between the particles in the bed. The validity of the assumptions was confirmed by experiments. The mass flow of material between interacting screen planes was also modelled. The model was implemented in a computer program, after which its validity was verified by a large number of full-scale tests. Thus, it is now possible to optimize a screening process, with respect to the percentage of over and undersized particles allowed, by varying the frequency, stroke, inclination, length, width and aperture size of the screen, as well as the feed rate, feed size distribution and number of interacting screen planes. If a set of simulations is made for a given screen, a screening performance map can be obtained which, in turn, can be used when optimizing a given screening task...|$|E

50|$|Screen Mesh- Just like thread is woven {{together}} to create cloth, metal wire can be woven to create a metal <b>cloth.</b> <b>Screen</b> Mesh has evolved over many years of competitive screen manufacturing resulting in very thin yet strong cloth designed to maximize screen life and conductance {{as well as to}} provide a consistent cut point. To increase the conductance of a mesh screen you have to minimize the amount of material in the way, this is done by either reducing the wire diameter or weaving the cloth to produce rectangular openings. Rectangular openings increase the screens conductance while minimizing the effect on its cut point where as square openings provide a more consistent cut point but offer a lower conductance.|$|R
