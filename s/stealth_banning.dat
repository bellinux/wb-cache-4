5000|$|Graham {{has stated}} {{he hopes to}} avoid the Eternal September that results in the general decline of {{intelligent}} discourse within a community. The site has a proactive attitude in moderating content, including automated flame and spam detectors. It also practices <b>stealth</b> <b>banning</b> in which user posts stop appearing for others to see, unbeknownst to the user. Additional software is employed to detect [...] "voting rings to purposefully vote up stories".|$|E
50|$|<b>Stealth</b> <b>banning</b> (also called shadow banning, {{ghost banning}} or comment ghosting) is {{the act of}} {{blocking}} a user from an online community such that the user does not realize {{that they have been}} banned. By making a problem user's contributions invisible or less prominent to other members of the service, the hope is that in the absence of reactions to their comments, the problematic user will become bored or frustrated and leave the site. If the user never becomes aware that they were banned, it will not occur to them to attempt to circumvent that ban.|$|E
5000|$|Michael Pryor of Fog Creek Software {{described}} <b>stealth</b> <b>banning</b> {{for online}} forums in 2006, saying {{how such a}} system was {{in place in the}} project management system FogBugz, [...] "to solve the problem of {{how do you get the}} person to go away and leave you alone". As well as preventing problem users from engaging in flame wars, the system also discouraged spammers, who if they returned to the site would be under the false impression that their spam was still in place. The Verge describes it as [...] "one of the oldest moderation tricks in the book", noting that early versions of vBulletin had a global ignore list known as [...] "Tachy goes to Coventry", as in the British expression [...] "to send someone to Coventry", meaning to ignore them and pretend they don't exist.|$|E
50|$|Blocked users may be {{completely}} unable to access {{all or part}} of a site's content, which is usually the case when censoring or filtering mechanisms are responsible for the block. Under a <b>stealth</b> <b>ban,</b> a user is given the false impression that their content is still being posted to the site, when in reality it is being hidden from all other users.|$|R
5000|$|Crossposting is {{the act of}} posting {{the same}} message to {{multiple}} information channels; forums, mailing lists, or newsgroups. This is distinct from multiposting, which is the posting of separate identical messages, individually, to each channel, (a forum, a newsgroup, an email list, or topic area). Enforcement actions against crossposting individuals vary from simple admonishments up to total lifetime bans. In some cases, on email lists and forums, an individual is put under a <b>Stealth</b> <b>Ban</b> where their posts are distributed back to {{them as if they}} were being distributed normally, but the rest of the subscribers are not sent the messages. This is easily detected if the Stealthed individual has two different, and totally non-associated identities in the channel, such that the non-stealthed identity will see a different set of messages, lacking the posts of the stealthed individual, in their view of the channel.|$|R
40|$|Unaccountable {{power at}} any layer of online life can stifle {{innovation}} elsewhere. Dominant search engines rightly worry that carriers will use their {{control of the}} physical layer of internet infrastructure to pick winners among content and application providers. Though they advocate net neutrality, they have been much less quick to recognize the threat to openness and fair play their own practices may pose. Just as dominant search engines fear an unfairly tiered online world, they {{should be required to}} provide access to their archives and indices in a nondiscriminatory manner. If dominant search engines want carriers to disclose their traffic management tactics, they should submit to regulation that <b>bans</b> <b>stealth</b> marketing and reliably verifies the absence of the practice. Finally, search engines 2 Ì† 7 concern about the applications and content disadvantaged by carrier fast-tracking should lead them to provide annotation remedies to indexed sites whose marks have been unfairly occluded by the search process. Fair competition online demands common commercial ethics for both dominant search engines and dominant carriers...|$|R
