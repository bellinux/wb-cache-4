40|$|<b>Renal</b> <b>aplasia</b> is the {{predominant}} cause of congenital solitary kidneys. BackgroundCongenital solitary kidneys, which {{are susceptible to}} renal failure, have been considered mostly due to unilateral renal agenesis and partly due to <b>renal</b> <b>aplasia.</b> Risk of familial recurrence and of other associated anomalies {{is known to be}} much higher in renal agenesis than in <b>renal</b> <b>aplasia.</b> However, differential diagnosis between the two renal anomalies is difficult, and renal agenesis has been found much less frequently in ultrasound screening studies of fetuses than in autopsy studies. MethodsIn order to investigate the nature and incidence of the congenital solitary kidney, the present study performed ultrasound screening of the kidneys in 4000 newborn babies. A diagnosis of renal agenesis was made when ultrasound identified no renal parenchyma and renoscintigraphy showed no renal function, and <b>renal</b> <b>aplasia</b> when there was a renal parenchyma without any function. ResultsPrimary screening detected 52 babies suspected of having small kidneys and one baby with a multicystic dysplastic kidney, but no baby with renal agenesis. Forty-seven of the 53 babies underwent a second ultrasound scanning at one month of age. Three small kidneys in three babies further decreased in size, had no function and were diagnosed as <b>renal</b> <b>aplasia</b> (which has an incidence rate of one in 1300). Follow-up ultrasound studies showed further regression in all three, which became very hard to distinguish by one year of age. ConclusionsThe present study showed that ultrasound in the neonatal period could identify the aplastic kidney, which had a reniform shape, not rudimentary, during the newborn period, and regressed rapidly thereafter. These findings indicate that most renal agenesis diagnosed clinically thus far might more correctly be <b>renal</b> <b>aplasia...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{possible}} {{association of}} a single umbilical artery (SUA) with malformations of vascular etiology is investigated in this study. Four hundred twelve fetal and embryonic autopsies showing one or more congenital malformations, collected over 7 years, were reviewed. Microscopic confirmation of a SUA was evident in 20 cases (4. 85 %). The two subgroups with 2 (n(A) = 20) or 3 umbilical vessels (n(B) = 392) were compared with each other, {{in relation to the}} frequency of malformations per organ system. In the group of fetuses with congenital malformations, no association was observed between SUA and the incidence of CNS, cardiac, pulmonary, or genital malformations. However, there was a significantly higher incidence of atresia of hollow organs (P = 0. 003), <b>renal</b> <b>aplasia</b> (P = 0. 034), and limb reduction defects (LRD) (P = 0. 0383) when only a single umbilical artery was present.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the association between the presence of clinical symptoms of peripheral artery disease and <b>severe</b> <b>renal</b> artery stenosis in patients referred for renal angiography. METHOD: We included 82 patients with clinical suspicion of renovascular hypertension and performed an imaging investigation (renal Doppler ultrasound and/or renal scintigraphy) for possible renal artery stenosis. All patients underwent renal arteriography and were examined for peripheral artery disease based on the presence of intermittent claudication and ankle-brachial index test results. <b>Severe</b> <b>renal</b> artery stenosis was defined as a lesion causing 70 % obstruction. RESULTS: <b>Severe</b> <b>renal</b> artery stenosis was present in 32 of 82 (39 %) patients. Patients with <b>severe</b> <b>renal</b> artery stenosis were older (63 ± 12 vs 56 ± 12 years, p= 0. 006), had more intermittent claudication (55 vs 45 %, p= 0. 027), and had a greater prevalence of an ankle-brachial index < 0. 9 (44 % vs 20 %, p= 0. 021) than patients without <b>severe</b> <b>renal</b> artery stenosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of intermittent claudication was independently associated with renal artery stenosis ≥ 70 % (OR: 3. 33; 95 % CI 1. 03 - 10. 82, p= 0. 04), unlike the ankle-brachial index, which showed no association (OR: 1. 44; 95 % CI 0. 37 - 5. 66, p= 0. 60). CONCLUSION: Intermittent claudication is independently associated with <b>severe</b> <b>renal</b> artery stenosis (≥ 70 %) in patients clinically suspected of having renovascular hypertension...|$|R

However, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TM-α in DIC patients with <b>severe</b> <b>renal</b> impairment {{have not yet been}} elucidated. We investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TM-α in DIC patients with <b>severe</b> <b>renal</b> impairment. Eleven DIC patients with the <b>severe</b> <b>renal</b> impairment (creatinine clearance (CLcr) < 30 ml/min) and 10 DIC patients without <b>severe</b> <b>renal</b> impairment (CLcr ≥ 30 ml/min) were included in this study. In all patients, a dose of 380 U/kg of TM-α was administered during a 30 min infusion. Blood samples were taken {{before the start of the}} first TM-α administration, and at 0. 5, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h after the start of administration. Although the clearance of TM-α in the patients with renal impairment was 80 % of that in the patients without renal impairment, none of the pharmacokinetic values were significantly different between the groups. In the pharmacokinetic simulation, however, the trough levels of TM-α increased gradually in the patients with renal impairment when the same dose of TM-α was repeatedly administered. After the administration of TM-α, the prothrombinase activities in the patients in both groups were sufficiently inhibited during the observation period. Although the pharmacokinetic values in DIC patients with <b>severe</b> <b>renal</b> impairment were only slightly different from those in DIC patients without <b>severe</b> <b>renal</b> impairment, we need to pay attention to the elevation of the trough levels of TM-α when the same dose of TM-α is repeatedly administered...|$|R

Objectives: To evaluate the effect of <b>severe</b> <b>renal</b> impairment on the pharmacokinetics of umeclidinium and umeclidinium/vilanterol. Methods: Nine patients with <b>severe</b> <b>renal</b> impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) and nine matched healthy volunteers received a single dose of umeclidinium 125 µg; and after a 7 - to 14 -day washout, a single dose of umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 / 25 µg. Results: No clinically relevant increases in plasma umeclidinium or vilanterol systemic exposure (area under the curve or maximum observed plasma concentration) were observed following umeclidinium 125 µg or umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 / 25 µg administration. On average, the amount of umeclidinium excreted in 24 hours in urine (90 % confidence interval) was 88 % (81 %– 93 %) and 89 % (81 %– 93 %) lower in patients with <b>severe</b> <b>renal</b> impairment compared with healthy volunteers following umeclidinium 125 µg and umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 / 25 µg administration, respectively.

Design, setting, participants, & measurements: We enrolled and followed a prospective, consecutive cohort (June 2007 through January 2009) of patients who received intravenous contrast for CECT in the emergency department of a large, academic, tertiary care center. Outcomes measured were as follows (1) CIN: An increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0. 5 mg/dl or ≥ 25 % 2 to 7 d after contrast administration; (2) <b>severe</b> <b>renal</b> failure: An increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 3. 0 mg/dl or the need for dialysis at 45 d; and (3) renal failure as a contributing cause of death (consensus of three independent physicians) at 45 d.
