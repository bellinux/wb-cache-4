40|$|In {{developing}} its thesis, this Article {{will review the}} history and purpose of IAEA safeguards and their relation to the NPT, and then show that special inspections in the DPRK represent a transitional moment for the IAEA safeguards system. This Article will then consider two different {{arguments in favor of}} a continuing right to inspections even against a state exercising its right to withdraw from the NPT to escape its safeguards obligations: the first identifies circumstances under which a state would {{not have the right to}} withdraw from the NPT; and the second asserts that the effects of withdrawal from the NPT do not include the extinction of the <b>safeguards</b> <b>obligations,</b> or at least certain critical safeguards duties established through NPT adherence. The Article demonstrates that it is impossible to identify any meaningful and principled limitation to a NPT party 2 ̆ 7 s right to withdraw. It then argues that, although the IAEA 2 ̆ 7 s right to apply safeguards with respect to the nuclear activities of the withdrawing state terminates with withdrawal, a right to conduct any special inspection requested before withdrawal relating to suspect activities that occurred while the state was still a party to the NPT should survive withdrawal. This argument is framed in terms not only of general principles of treaty law articulated in the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties, which, for the most part, represents a codification of customary international law, but also in terms of the object and purpose of the NPT and safeguards agreements entered into by states to fulfill their NPT <b>safeguards</b> <b>obligations.</b> Finally, this Article recommends that an interpretation to this effect be reflected in the final documents of the conference to be held by the parties to the NPT in 1995 for the review and extension of the Treaty...|$|R

In November 2003 IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei reported that Iran had repeatedly and over an extended period failed to meet its <b>safeguards</b> <b>obligations,</b> including by failing to declare its uranium enrichment program. After about two years of EU3-led diplomatic efforts and Iran temporarily suspending its enrichment program, the IAEA Board of Governors, acting under Article XII.C of the IAEA Statute, found in a rare non-consensus decision with 12 abstentions that these failures constituted non-compliance with the IAEA safeguards agreement. This was reported to the UN Security Council in 2006, after which the Security Council passed a resolution demanding that Iran suspend its enrichment.Instead, Iran resumed its enrichment program.|$|R

40|$|In {{pursuing}} its <b>Safeguards</b> <b>obligations</b> the IAEA measures fission neutrons in high gamma-radiation {{fields of}} spent fuel. In order to characterize IAEA-owned detectors {{the response of}} two neutron detectors (provided by IAEA) with high counting efficiency and low gamma sensitivity was investigated in neutron and gamma fields {{as well as in}} mixed neutron/gamma fields. Furthermore, the optimum moderator thickness (polyethylene moderator, PE) was calculated for maximum detection efficiency with response to fission spectrum neutrons. These calculations were performed using the MCNP code. The relevant data of the He- 3 detectors (e. g. wall thickness, wall material, length etc.) were taken into account as well as two different source geometries: a point source and a line source. The gamma measurements were performed mainly with an intense Co- 60 source. Neutrons were produced by Cf- 252 and Am/Be isotopic sources and for even higher intensities with a sealed tube 14 MeV neutron generator. Pulse height spectra have been measured. Whereas at low gamma dose rates the multichannel pulse height spectrum shows a clear separation of the neutron and gamma ray signals, in high gamma radiation fields pile-up events may prevent a clear separation of the neutron events. For different gamma dose rates the quality of separation of neutron and gamma signals has been recorded. The results of the MCNP calculations for the PE moderator are compared with actual measurements. Results of the measurements of the characteristics of these He- 3 neutron tubes and an evaluation regarding their application in high gamma-ray environments are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{on-going}} diplomatic crisis over Iran’s {{nuclear program}} is a widely debated security issue. However, less {{attention has been paid}} to how Iran’s nuclear program went from tight civilian nuclear collaboration with Western countries in the past to today’s situation of almost total isolation. This shift presents a knowledge gap this thesis has sought to explore. The research question which has guided this analysis is: How did Iran go from pursuing mainly civilian nuclear assistance under the Shah’s regime, towards an increasingly covert strategy combining sensitive and non-sensitive nuclear assistance from states and black market providers through the 1980 s and 1990 s? Through a careful examination of all nuclear assistance Iran sought and received from 1976 to 2002 I have shown how Iran’s pursuit of nuclear energy became increasingly covert, sensitive and uncompromising throughout the 1980 s and 1990 s. Iran increasingly pursued sensitive nuclear assistance from various sources, engaged in secret activities and sales deals, as well as failed in a number of instances to live up to its <b>safeguard</b> <b>obligations.</b> The similarities between Iran’s nuclear path in this period and the “typical path of nuclear aspiring states” have made scholars and policymakers jump to the conclusion that Iran was building a secret nuclear weapons program. I do not reject that nuclear weapons ambitions played a role per se, but I find that the omission of other factors, which have influenced the direction of Iran’s nuclear path, has led to an overestimation of the nuclear weapons aspect. For instance, the importance of national pride in Iranian nuclear decision-making has been neglected in the literature. The Iranian decision to pursue the whole nuclear fuel cycle can also be interpreted as a question of international and regional prestige. Also, the military, diplomatic and economic isolation of Iran through the 1980 s and 1990 s, as well as the strengthening of export controls in the same period may have determined the direction of Iran’s nuclear path. The emphasis on these partially neglected factors aims to sharpen the understanding of Iran’s nuclear behaviour, and provide alternative explanations to the current view manifested around the idea of Iranian nuclear weapons ambitions...|$|R
40|$|European Union (EU) Member States are {{interested}} in using health impact assessment (HIA) {{as a means of}} <b>safeguarding</b> their <b>obligations</b> to protect human health under the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam. However, several have encountered difficulties institutionalizing HIA with the policy-making process. As a consequence, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe has suggested coupling HIA with strategic environmental assessment (SEA). Traditionally, the incorporation of HIA into other forms of impact assessment has been resisted, for fear of losing its focus on health issues to environmental concerns, and compromising its social model of health with the introduction of biophysical indicators. But can these fears be substantiated? In this paper, we investigate the grounds for such concerns by reviewing the relevant policy documents and departmental guidelines of four non-European countries that have considered the use of integrated assessment. We found that the case for associating HIA with SEA in Europe is strong, and offers potential solutions to problems of screening, theoretical framework, causal pathways and ready entry to the policy process. Coupling HIA with SEA may thus be the next step forward in a longer journey towards institutionalizing HIA as an independent policy-linked device...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{relations}} {{between the individual and}} human rights on the one hand, and the State on the other, {{in the context of the}} Constitution of the Republic of Poland. The author poses the question whether the idea of subordination of the State to the individual is really a central idea of that constitution. He puts forward many arguments against such suggestion. These arguments relate, above all, to the arrangement of the constitution: a chapter concerning human rights is chapter II, while chapter I deals with foundation of the State; the goals of the State are specified in the preamble including the following initial phrase “the existence and future of Poland as our Homeland” and in Article 5 where human rights are as subject of protection by the State is mentioned after independence and integrity of [its] territory; a general concept of human rights protection adopted in the constitution is dominated by the structures typical of law in its objective sense; the way of regulation admissible limitations on human rights differs from international standards; possibility of claiming human rights is constitutionally guaranteed, mostly by constitutional complaint which is above all aimed at correction of legal system, rather than claiming of rights by the individual; Article 1 (“The Republic of Poland shall be the common good of all its citizens”) interpreted as referring to Article 1 paragraph 1 of the April Constitution of 1935, one of the main ideas of which was precedence of the State over the individual. He also analyses the arguments in favour of the recognition of the idea of subordination of the State. Nevertheless, they cannot be accepted as resolving the question of whether it is a central idea of the constitution. These arguments include in particular: the principle of subsidiarity contained in the preamble, even if it has not been appropriately emphasized there; recognition of inherent and inalienable dignity of the person, but it was not until Article 30 that this provision has been contained and it does not determine the {{relations between the}} human dignity and rights and the State. The author suggests that the only conclusive way to justify the subordination of the State in relation to the individual as a central idea of the constitution is by means of Article 1. Taking into account, above all, preparatory work, we should reject the interpretation of that article referring to the April (1935) Constitution. Essential interpretative context may be found in preparatory work and social teachings of the Catholic Church, referred to therein. In that case, the common good means the entirety of the conditions of social life which favour the human development. These conditions include above all the respect for human dignity. Such interpretation of Article 1 gives priority to proposals on what the State should be to serve the individual rather than to <b>safeguard</b> <b>obligations</b> of citizens in relation to the State...|$|R
40|$|The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs {{published}} the Heads of the Children First Bill on the 25 th of April 2012. The stated {{purpose of the}} proposed legislation (“the Children First Scheme”) is to place certain aspects of Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children on a statutory footing. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence also {{published the}} Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 on the same day. This legislation (“the Withholding Information Bill”) creates a criminal offence of withholding information in relation to serious specified offences committed against a child or vulnerable person. 1. 2. Section 7 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 provides that the Ombudsman for Children may give advice to Ministers of the Government on any matter relating to the rights and welfare of children, including the probable effect of proposals for legislation. In accordance with this statutory function, the Ombudsman for Children’s Office has set out below a number of observations and recommendations on the proposals put forward by the Government. This submission builds on previous advice provided by the Ombudsman for Children’s Office {{in relation to the}} Scheme of the Withholding Information Bill and the initial proposals to place aspects of Children First on a statutory footing. 1. 3. These initiatives represent a significant development in the legislative framework governing child protection in Ireland. This Office has decided to comment on the Children First Scheme and the Withholding Information Bill in the same submission because of the overlap between them with respect to the issue of reporting abuse. It is acknowledged that the Children First Scheme is broader in scope and addresses other issues such as the general <b>safeguarding</b> <b>obligations</b> on specified organisations, cooperation and information sharing, and the framework for the implementation of Children First. In addition, the threshold for reporting under the Withholding Information Bill differs from the Children First Scheme with respect {{to the nature of the}} offences to be reported and the quality of the information held by the person on whom there is an obligation to report. The Children First Scheme relates primarily to reporting obligations to the HSE, whereas the 4 Withholding Information Bill is concerned with reporting to An Garda Síochána. However, both deal with arrangements for reporting child abuse and, together with the National Vetting Bureau Bill, form a suite of child protection legislation being advanced by the government at present. Moreover, certain individuals will potentially find themselves subject to reporting requirements under both pieces of legislation with respect to the same child protection concerns. As a result, it is important that they be consistent with one another and provide clarity in relation to when and how members of the public, as well as particular organisations and professionals, are to report child protection concerns. 1. 4. This Office previously advised that consideration be given to merging the two Bills or that they be advanced through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the same time. This would assist the Oireachtas in ensuring that the two pieces of legislation cohere fully with each other. As the Oireachtas has already begun its consideration of the Withholding Information Bill 2012, it is recommended that the latter option be taken. It is recommended that the Withholding Information Bill 2012 and the forthcoming Children First Bill 2012 be advanced through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the same time in order to ensure that both pieces of legislation cohere fully with each other...|$|R
40|$|Domestic {{violence}} in its serious manifestation with dowry {{is one of}} the leading causes of torture to women in Bangladesh. Women 2 ̆ 7 s dignity as core value of human rights law is deeply entrenched in numerous international instruments under which Bangladesh assumes affirmative obligations to respect and ensure this right. Quite consistent with these <b>obligations,</b> <b>safeguard</b> from torture is repeatedly affirmed in a series of legislations in Bangladesh. The Dowry Prohibition Act, for example, was enacted in 1980 to exclusively deal with dowry and to outlaw dowry with a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. Despite the fact, dowry-related cruelty becomes endemic in the country. In 2006, dowry violence alone resulted in altogether 300 violent incidents, while in 2005, 227 women were murdered and 114 suffered torture in connection with dowry. This number, however, represents only a fraction of total dowry-victims since women are very reluctant to unearth their 2 ̆ 7 hidden wounds 2 ̆ 7 before the public for several reasons. The prominent reasons are; the loss of family honour and privacy; the fear of reprisals of their in-laws and the unresponsive legal remedies. Also, in a substantial number of cases, the perpetrators enjoy political impunity and. victims are left with virtually no legal recourse. This short note, however, does not address these issues; I argued elsewhere how the socio-legal approach in Bangladesh became inept to capture or ineffective in capturing women 2 ̆ 7 s unique experiences and needs. This paper therefore looks at a different context, proposing to reconceptualising the concept of domestic violence to provide appropriate values and respect to women...|$|R
40|$|The Governing Uranium {{project is}} a global {{research}} effort studying the implications of a changing uranium market, specifically the production, processing and transport of uranium ore concentrates (UOC), {{commonly referred to as}} "yellowcake". In total, 15 uranium producing and consuming countries were studied, representing 85 % of global production and 70 % of consumption. The concluding final report published 28 August 2015, provides a mapping of an evolving system of treaties, guidelines, and regional and national obligations {{at a time when the}} uranium market is shifting both structurally and geopolitically. This regulatory snapshot is particularly relevant as more front-end materials fall under the full-scope safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), placing new obligations on state regulatory authorities and industry and facility operators, as well as new verification responsibilities on the IAEA. This means that, although the three rules of real estate apply to uranium (location, location, location), the uranium market is still global, while export controls and nuclear security are still local (that is, national). The expansion of civilian nuclear fuel cycles to new centres of production and consumption thus calls for increased harmonisation of regulations across states. The report begins with a look at the uranium industry (Chapter 2), followed by descriptions of the evolving application of IAEA safeguards (Chapter 3) and the international nuclear security structure (Chapter 4) as it applies to the (very) front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle. Chapter 5 analyses best practices in tracking and inventory controls to ensure that <b>safeguards</b> and security <b>obligations</b> are met efficiently and effectively. Each chapter provides recommendations for addressing governance gaps at the international and national levels as the industry undergoes legal and structural reforms. It attempts to assist long-time suppliers in updating governance approaches and newcomers in developing nationally appropriate regulatory systems from scratch based on global best practices...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} is a guidance document from a series prepared for the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), under the Next Generation Safeguards Initiative (NGSI), to assist facility designers and operators in implementing international Safeguards-by-Design (SBD). SBD has two main objectives: (1) to avoid costly and time consuming redesign work or retrofits of new nuclear fuel cycle facilities and (2) to make the implementation of international safeguards more effective and efficient at such facilities. In the long term, the attainment of these goals would save industry and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) time, money, and resources and be mutually beneficial. This particular safeguards guidance document focuses on pebble fuel high temperature gas reactors (HTGR). The purpose of the IAEA safeguards system is to provide credible assurance {{to the international community}} that nuclear material and other specified items are not diverted from peaceful nuclear uses. The safeguards system consists of the IAEA’s statutory authority to establish safeguards; <b>safeguards</b> rights and <b>obligations</b> in <b>safeguards</b> agreements and additional protocols; and technical measures implemented pursuant to those agreements. Of foremost importance is the international safeguards agreement between the country and the IAEA, concluded pursuant to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). According to a 1992 IAEA Board of Governors decision, countries must: notify the IAEA of a decision to construct a new nuclear facility as soon as such decision is taken; provide design information on such facilities as the designs develop; and provide detailed design information based on construction plans at least 180 days {{prior to the start of}} construction, and on "as-built" designs at least 180 days before the first receipt of nuclear material. Ultimately, the design information will be captured in an IAEA Design Information Questionnaire (DIQ), prepared by the facility operator, typically with the support of the facility designer. The IAEA will verify design information over the life of the project. This design information is an important IAEA safeguards tool. Since the main interlocutor with the IAEA in each country is the State Regulatory Authority/SSAC (or Regional Regulatory Authority, e. g. EURATOM), the responsibility for conveying this design information to the IAEA falls to the State Regulatory Authority/SSAC...|$|R
