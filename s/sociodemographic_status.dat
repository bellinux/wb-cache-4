50|$|A recent {{pilot study}} {{intended}} {{to document the}} personal and socioenvironmental correlates to health-related quality of life within Mexican American adults living in colonias found that colonia residents are worse off in terms of physical health compared to the U.S. average. By examining Mexican-Americans residing in Hidalgo County, Texas in the Lower Rio Grande Valley near the U.S.-Mexican Border, investigators provide new knowledge for health professionals and policy makers {{in order to provide}} more effective preventive and medical services to underserved communities. The research provides statistical data and analysis as well as a discussion about the importance of a health-related quality of life. However, because the study is restricted to only Mexican American adults living in border colonias, {{further research is needed to}} substantiate these findings in a larger framework. As stated earlier this study is intended for health professionals and policy makers to focus on the need to provide preventive and medical services for underserved and underrepresented populations. Through this research investigators found that Mexican Americans living in colonias share similar mental health patterns compared to the U.S. average, but in terms of physical health they were worse off. Data collected through a household survey in 2002 and 2003 by the Integrated Health Outreach System Project (IHOS) was analyzed to describe the population in terms of <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status,</b> HRQL, and other variables. In response to this survey 81% considered that access to health- care services was a problem; 62.5% mentioned housing; 76.5% perceived not having enough recreational and cultural activities; 86% perceived social issues; and 41.1% perceived physical environmental problems, specifically polluted air or water. In conclusion, the research provides significant data acknowledging health disparities colonia residents continuously face.|$|E
40|$|Data on <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status,</b> health beliefs, {{knowledge}} of hepatitis B, experience with prior vaccinations, health locus of control, {{and desire to}} receive hepatitis B vaccine were assessed in 1, 500 hospital employees. Twenty per cent of the variance {{of the decision to}} accept vaccine could be explained; beliefs about the safety and efficacy of vaccine influenced acceptance most. Beliefs concerning the likelihood of contracting hepatitis B and the chance of becoming severely ill were less important determinants of vaccine acceptance. Additional factors studied, including knowledge, experience with vaccinations, and <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status,</b> were important independent determinants of health beliefs. We conclude that the beliefs of health care providers, particularly regarding the safety and efficacy of hepatitis B vaccine, {{have a major impact on}} their decision to accept or reject vaccine.

40|$|Background The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) aims {{to bring}} {{together}} all available epidemiological data using a coherent measurement framework, standardised estimation methods, and transparent data sources to enable comparisons of health loss over time and across causes, age–sex groups, and countries. The GBD {{can be used to}} generate summary measures such as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE) that make possible comparative assessments of broad epidemiological patterns across countries and time. These summary measures {{can also be used to}} quantify the component of variation in epidemiology that is related to sociodemographic development. Methods We used the published GBD 2013 data for age-specific mortality, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) to calculate DALYs and HALE for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013 for 188 countries. We calculated HALE using the Sullivan method; 95 % uncertainty intervals (UIs) represent uncertainty in age-specific death rates and YLDs per person for each country, age, sex, and year. We estimated DALYs for 306 causes for each country as the sum of YLLs and YLDs; 95 % UIs represent uncertainty in YLL and YLD rates. We quantified patterns of the epidemiological transition with a composite indicator of <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status,</b> which we constructed from income per person, average years of schooling after age 15 years, and the total fertility rate and mean age of the population. We applied hierarchical regression to DALY rates by cause across countries to decompose variance related to the <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status</b> variable, country, and time. Findings Worldwide, from 1990 to 2013, life expectancy at birth rose by 6 · 2 years (95 % UI 5 · 6 – 6 · 6), from 65 · 3 years (65 · 0 – 65 · 6) in 1990 to 71 · 5 years (71 · 0 – 71 · 9) in 2013, HALE at birth rose by 5 · 4 years (4 · 9 – 5 · 8), from 56 · 9 years (54 · 5 – 59 · 1) to 62 · 3 years (59 · 7 – 64 · 8), total DALYs fell by 3 · 6 % (0 · 3 – 7 · 4), and age-standardised DALY rates per 100 ¿ 000 people fell by 26 · 7 % (24 · 6 – 29 · 1). For communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, global DALY numbers, crude rates, and age-standardised rates have all declined between 1990 and 2013, whereas for non–communicable diseases, global DALYs have been increasing, DALY rates have remained nearly constant, and age-standardised DALY rates declined during the same period. From 2005 to 2013, the number of DALYs increased for most specific non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, in addition to dengue, food-borne trematodes, and leishmaniasis; DALYs decreased for nearly all other causes. By 2013, the five leading causes of DALYs were ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, cerebrovascular disease, low back and neck pain, and road injuries. <b>Sociodemographic</b> <b>status</b> explained more than 50 % of the variance between countries and over time for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; maternal disorders; neonatal disorders; nutritional deficiencies; other communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; musculoskeletal disorders; and other non-communicable diseases. However, <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status</b> explained less than 10 % of the variance in DALY rates for cardiovascular diseases; chronic respiratory diseases; cirrhosis; diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases; unintentional injuries; and self-harm and interpersonal violence. Predictably, increased <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status</b> was associated with a shift in burden from YLLs to YLDs, driven by declines in YLLs and increases in YLDs from musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and mental and substance use disorders. In most country-specific estimates, the increase in life expectancy was greater than that in HALE. Leading causes of DALYs are highly variable across countries. Interpretation Global health is improving. Population growth and ageing have driven up numbers of DALYs, but crude rates have remained relatively constant, showing that progress in health does not mean fewer demands on health systems. The notion of an epidemiological transition—in which increasing <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status</b> brings structured change in disease burden—is useful, but there is tremendous variation in burden of disease that is not associated with <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status.</b> This further underscores the need for country-specific assessments of DALYs and HALE to appropriately inform health policy decisions and attendant actions...|$|E
40|$|Recursive {{partitioning}} is an analytic {{technique that}} {{is useful for}} identifying complex combinations of conditions that predict particular outcomes {{as well as for}} delineating multiple subgroup differences in how such factors work together. As such, the methodology is well suited to multidisciplinary, life course inquiry in which the goal is to integrate many interacting influences and understand subgroup variation. The authors conducted recursive partitioning analyses on a previously published study (D. K. Mroczek & C. M. Kolarz, 1998) that investigated life course profiles of positive and negative affect and incorporated various top-down (personality traits) and bottom-up (<b>sociodemographic</b> <b>statuses,</b> contextual influences) influences. The new analyses reveal multiway, nonlinear interactions among these variables in predicting affective experience and, importantly, life course differences in how these various factors combine. Included are details of how recursive partitioning trees are generated as well as descriptions of the software packages available for using such techniques. Overall, the methodology offers tractable strategies for discerning meaningful patterns in highly complex data sets...|$|R

We {{examined}} {{association between}} incidence rate of {{low birth weight}} in liveborn infants and maternal <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status</b> in Tuzla Canton during 1992 – 1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Methods. The present study covers a 22 -year period (1988 – 2009), including the war period (1992 – 1995), and we retrospectively collected data on a total of 108 316 liveborn infants and their mothers from three different socioeconomic periods: before (1988 – 1991), during (1992 – 1995), {{and after the war}} (1996 – 2009). Association between incidence rate of low birth weight in liveborn infants and maternal <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status</b> were determined for each study period. Results. There were 23 194 live births in the prewar, 18 302 during the war, and 66 820 in the postwar period. Among the liveborn infants born during the war, 1373 (7. 5 %) had birth weight of < 2500 [*]g, which is significantly more in comparison with 851 (3. 6 %) liveborn infants in this birth weight group born before and 1864 (2. 8 %) after the war. We found the number of examinations during pregnancy was 1. 8 per pregnant woman in the war period, which was low in comparison with the number of examinations before (4. 6 per pregnant woman) and after (7. 1 per pregnant woman) the war (<. 001 for both). Prewar perinatal mortality LBW infants of 6. 2 per 1000 live births increased to 10. 8 per 1000 live births during the war (<. 001), but after the war, perinatal mortality LBW infants (5. 2 ‰) and early neonatal mortality (2. 4 ‰) decreased.

Between February and April 2013, 392 patients on HIV care at Nyeri Provincial General Hospital participated in this study. Data were collected using a self-administered health survey questionnaire assessing health and <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>statuses.</b> A manual stepwise general linear model was specified to measure the effect of engagement in HIV and other associated predictors on medication adherence.

40|$|Aim: It {{has been}} {{reported}} that a great proportion of mental health disorders have an origin in early childhood. In order to evaluate factors possibly associated with children’s health, the health monitoring units have been established since 2004 in six study regions in Bavaria, Germany. The second health monitoring survey, implemented in 2005 - 06, focuses on the mental health status of preschool children. The goal of this study is (1) to examine the association of sociodemographic and environmental factors with mental health and (2) to analyze the applicability {{of the results of the}} health monitoring units to all preschool children in Bavaria by calculating weighting factors. Methods: Data on 6, 206 preschool children are available. Logistic regression analysis is applied to analyze possible associations with mental health. A weighting method is applied to correct for deviances compared to the whole population of preschool children in Bavaria (N= 132, 783). Results: 11 % of preschool children show mental health problems. Regarding different indicators of <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status,</b> low household income [unadjusted OR 3. 34, 95 % CI: 2. 23 - 4. 98] shows the strongest association of mental health problems. Non-accessibility of green space [unadjusted OR 2. 74, 95 % CI: 1. 87 - 4. 00] is also strongly associated with mental health. The results of the unweighted and weighted analysis are similar. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status</b> and factors in the living environment show associations with mental health of children. Based on the results of the unweighted and weighted analyses, the second health monitoring analysis shows little deviances compared to data of all Bavarian preschool children. Therefore, the results can be compared to all Bavarian preschool children. JRC. H. 2 -Air and Climat...|$|E

Objectives. We examined association between incidence rate of low birth weight in liveborn infants and maternal <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status</b> in Tuzla Canton during 1992 – 1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Methods. The present study covers a 22 -year period (1988 – 2009), including the war period (1992 – 1995), and we retrospectively collected data on a total of 108 316 liveborn infants and their mothers from three different socioeconomic periods: before (1988 – 1991), during (1992 – 1995), {{and after the war}} (1996 – 2009). Association between incidence rate of low birth weight in liveborn infants and maternal <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status</b> were determined for each study period. Results. There were 23 194 live births in the prewar, 18 302 during the war, and 66 820 in the postwar period. Among the liveborn infants born during the war, 1373 (7. 5 %) had birth weight of < 2500 g, which is significantly more in comparison with 851 (3. 6 %) liveborn infants in this birth weight group born before and 1864 (2. 8 %) after the war. We found the number of examinations during pregnancy was 1. 8 per pregnant woman in the war period, which was low in comparison with the number of examinations before (4. 6 per pregnant woman) and after (7. 1 per pregnant woman) the war (P <. 001 for both). Prewar perinatal mortality LBW infants of 6. 2 per 1000 live births increased to 10. 8 per 1000 live births during the war (P <. 001), but after the war, perinatal mortality LBW infants (5. 2 ‰) and early neonatal mortality (2. 4 ‰) decreased.

40|$|Small for {{gestational age}} (SGA) {{is not only}} a major {{indicator}} of perinatal mortality and morbidity, but also the morbidity risks in later in life. We aim to estimate the association between the birth of SGA infants and the risk factors and adverse perinatal outcomes among twenty-nine countries in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia in 359 health facilities in 2010 - 11. We analysed facility-based, cross-sectional data from the WHO Multi-country Survey on Maternal and Newborn Health. We constructed multilevel logistic regression models with random effects for facilities and countries to estimate the risk factors for SGA infants using country-specific birthweight reference standards in preterm and term delivery, and SGA's association with adverse perinatal outcomes. We compared the risks and adverse perinatal outcomes with appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants categorized by preterm and term delivery. A total of 295, 829 singleton infants delivered were analysed. The overall prevalence of SGA was highest in Cambodia (18. 8 %), Nepal (17. 9 %), the Occupied Palestinian Territory (16. 1 %), and Japan (16. 0 %), while the lowest was observed in Afghanistan (4. 8 %), Uganda (6. 6 %) and Thailand (9. 7 %). The risk of preterm SGA infants was significantly higher among nulliparous mothers and mothers with chronic hypertension and preeclampsia/eclampsia (aOR: 2. 89; 95 % CI: 2. 55 - 3. 28) compared with AGA infants. Higher risks of term SGA were observed among sociodemographic factors and women with preeclampsia/eclampsia, anaemia and other medical conditions. Multiparity (> = 3) (AOR: 0. 88; 95 % CI: 0. 83 - 0. 92) was a protective factor for term SGA. The risk of perinatal mortality was significantly higher in preterm SGA deliveries in low to high HDI countries. Preterm SGA is associated with medical conditions related to preeclampsia, but not with <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status.</b> Term SGA is associated with <b>sociodemographic</b> <b>status</b> and various medical conditions...|$|E
40|$|Background. Performance-based {{measures}} of physical performance are examined {{for an older}} cohort of relatively high-functioning men and women. The influences of baseline behavioral, social, and psychological characteristics on patterns of change in performance over 2. 5 years are examined. Methods. A cohort of relatively high-functioning men and women, aged 70 - 79, identified in 1988 by subsampling from three community-based studies {{on the basis of}} physical and cognitive function. Baseline assessments included physical performance, <b>sociodemographic</b> characteristics, health <b>status,</b> and behavioral, social, and psychological characteristics. A summary measure of physical performance was developed from tests of balance, gait, lower body strength and coordination, and manual dexterity. In-home assessments were repeated at follow-up in 1991. Results. Linear regression models were used to identify significant behavioral, social, and psychological predictors of better performance at follow-up, controlling for known <b>sociodemographic</b> and health <b>status</b> predictors. Significant, independent associations with better performance were found for participation in moderate and/or strenuous exercise activity and greater frequency of emotional support from social networks, particularly among those reporting low frequency of instrumental support. These effects remained significant independent of incident health conditions during follow-up. None of the psychological characteristics was a significant predictor. Conclusions. Maintenance of better physical performance within a high-functioning cohort is influenced by prio...|$|R
