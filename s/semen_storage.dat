40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to address the {{question}} whether changes in boar semen quality after short-term storage could be predicted on the basis of standard semen parameters and TNF-α level determined on the day of semen collection under commercial conditions. Progressive motility showed the highest positive correlation with morphology on day 0 of collection, and progressive motility on day 3 (P 0. 5; P < 0. 05). TNF-α in seminal plasma is the only parameter measured on day 0 to show a significant correlation with the percentage of viable spermatozoa after 3 days of <b>semen</b> <b>storage</b> (r = 0. 495, P < 0. 05). ROC analysis shows that TNF-α level is helpful in discriminating viability outcome after <b>semen</b> <b>storage</b> (AUC = 0. 94, P < 0. 001). We can predict with 92. 35 % certainty that fresh semen samples with more than 150 pg/ml of TNF-α in the seminal plasma will retain more than 85 % of viable spermatozoa after 3 days of storage. Thus, TNF-α can contribute to predicting the quality of short-term stored semen...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Sperm Quality Index (SQI) is {{correlated}} with fresh broiler breeder semen quality. Our {{objective was to}} determine if the SQI from <b>semen</b> prior to <b>storage</b> is predictive of <b>semen</b> quality after <b>storage.</b> Prior to <b>semen</b> dilution, sperm concentration, viability, and SQI were determined for each male’s neat semen sample. Each ejaculate was then diluted 1 : 1 with Beltsville Poultry Semen Extender and maintained at 4 C on a rotary shaker for 16 h. After semen dilution, sperm concentration, viability, and SQI were obtained at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 h. The SQI increased from 0 to 4 h of storage then decreased in a quartic fashion as storage time further increased (r = 0. 83). There was a linear decrease in sperm viability as storage time 2 increased (r = 0. 87). There was a negative relationship for the SQI from fresh semen with percentage of dead 2 sperm over storage period yielding correlation coefficients ranging from r =- 0. 88 to- 0. 55. Over storage, positive correlation coefficients for the SQI from fresh semen with live sperm concentration ranged from 0. 47 to 0. 61. There were also strong positive correlations for percentage of dead sperm and live sperm concentration from fresh semen with their respective semen characteristic at each storage period (r= 0. 81 to 0. 97 and r= 0. 80 to 0. 96, respectively). There was a strong positive relationship for SQI from fresh semen with the SQI over storage (r= 0. 88 to 0. 94).

40|$|Abstract. In ratite farming, the low male {{to female}} ratio in the mating system restricts genetic {{improvement}} and prevents {{reduction of the}} number of males kept on-farm for fertilisation of the female flock. These issues can be overcome and the industry can better realise its potential by using artificial insemination (AI) technology. It is the only practical method for intensive genetic improvement of reproduction and the production of eggs, chicks, oil, meat and leather. For AI to be feasible, we need reliable methods for semen collection, artificial insemination, prolonged storage of spermatozoa in the female tract, high rates of lay, efficient protocols for <b>semen</b> <b>storage,</b> and a panel of quantitative methods for measuring true fertility and hatchability, sperm supply rates in vivo and sperm viability in vitro. For both emus and ostriches, prolonged sperm storage in females has already been demonstrated. Methods for semen collection and artificial insemination, using animal-friendly techniques, have also been developed. <b>Semen</b> <b>storage</b> and cryopreservation protocols are yet to be optimised and we still need to overcome the male-dependent rate of lay, but adoption of AI technology by the ratite industries is now feasible.

Several studies have shown its beneficial properties in numerous cell lines, but to date, the in vitro effects of rooibos extract on sperm cells are still unknown. In this study, boar semen was supplemented with four concentrations both of fermented and unfermented rooibos extracts during 96 h of liquid storage at 17 °C. The effects of rooibos extracts on sperm velocity, membrane integrity, and acrosomal status were evaluated at 2 h, 48 h, and 96 h of <b>semen</b> <b>storage.</b> Overall our results indicate that rooibos extract enhances sperm velocity, protects the acrosome structure, and tends to preserve the membrane integrity during <b>semen</b> <b>storage.</b> Although the unfermented rooibos showed higher total polyphenol content and total antioxidant capacity than the fermented one, the latter had better effects on sperm velocity leading to, for instance, an increase of 30 % in the rectilinear velocity (VSL) at 48 h compared to the control group.

40|$|THE poor {{success in}} {{attempts}} to store chicken semen in vitro is {{in sharp contrast to}} success obtained in storing chicken spermatozoa in the hen's oviduct and in storing bull semen in vitro. Work at this laboratory has provided evidence of the necessity of controlling the pH of <b>semen</b> during <b>storage</b> (Wilcox, 1958 a). This can most easily be done by dilution of semen with a buffer. However, dilution of semen, even when inseminated fresh, results in lowered fertility, so that from the outset it can be anticipated that fer-tility will be lowered when semen is di-luted. Evidence has been obtained (Wilcox, 1958 b) that semen can be centrifuged and the seminal plasma replaced by a sodium phosphate buffer with little loss of fer-tilizing capacity. This suggests a pro-cedure by which semen can be diluted and stored, and still be inseminated "un-diluted " by centrifuging the diluted semen just before insemination and re-placing the supernatant with only enough diluent to bring the solution to its original volume. By using centrifugation it should also be possible to control pH by replac-ing seminal plasma, which is poorly buf-fered, with a good buffer, and storing the sperm in that condition until insemina-tion. Accordingly, an experiment was set up to test these methods of handling semen...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine an optimum temperature and extender for short-term transport of canine ejaculated semen. There was no significant difference in the qualities of semen diluted with two kinds of extender, egg yolk Tris-citrate fructose (EYT-FC) or glucose (EYT-GC) extender, between the 2, 8 or 12 and the 4 °C control groups during storage for up to 48 hr, while the 16 – 24 °C groups showed decreased sperm motility during storage for 48 hr. However, the 2 °C group showed slightly lower sperm motility and slightly higher sperm abnormality than the 4 °C group. Therefore, we concluded that semen qualities can be maintained for up to 48 hr when canine semen samples are extended with EYT-FC or EYT-GC and stored at a temperature in the range of 4 – 12 °C.

On the other hand, with continued storage there was a marked increase in the incidence of spermatozoa with secondary morphological changes in the group of boars regarded as producing more sensitive semen. Ejaculates of group I boars evaluated directly after collection had an approximately 6 % smaller share of spermatozoa with undamaged cell membranes than the ejaculates of boars in group II (p≤ 0. 05). In the process of time the percentage of spermatozoa with undamaged cell membranes decreased. The sperm of group I boars was characterised with a lower sperm motility than the semen of group II boars. After 1 hour of storing diluted semen, the sperm motility of boars producing highly sensitive semen was already 4 % lower (p≤ 0. 05), and after 24 hours of storage it was 6. 33 % lower than that of the boars that produced semen with a low sensitivity. Factors that confirm the accuracy of insemination male selection can include a low rate of sperm motility decrease during the storage of diluted semen, low and contained incidence of secondary morphological changes in spermatozoa during <b>semen</b> <b>storage</b> and a high frequency of spermatozoa with undamaged cell membranes...|$|E
40|$|A {{wide range}} of extenders are {{available}} for storing fowl semen. Three of them (the Lake extender, the EK extender described by Łukaszewicz, and an extender described by Tselutin et al.) were tested for their suitability to store semen of 4 fowl breeds: Green-Legged Partridge, Black Minorca, White Crested Black Polish, and Italian Partridge. Changes in spermatozoa viability and morphology were evaluated in fresh neat semen and in semen diluted 1 : 4 and stored for 3, 6, and 24 h at 4 °C. During the time of <b>semen</b> <b>storage,</b> {{a decrease in the}} number of live, morphologically normal spermatozoa and an increase in dead spermatozoa and spermatozoa with bent necks were observed. The EK extender was found to be the most suitable regardless of the fowl breed because the number of live spermatozoa did not decrease as much as in semen diluted with the other extenders. The Lake extender had the least beneficial effect on stored sperm morphology in every breed. Key words: sperm quality, in vitro storage, semen extender, sperm morpholog...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate a range of avian semen extenders for liquid storage of Indian Red Jungle Fowl (Gallus gallus murghi) spermatozoa at 5 °C. Semen was collected from 8 mature trained cocks and processed in the Beltsville Poultry, Turkey, Lake, EK, Tselutin Poultry and Chicken <b>semen</b> extenders for <b>storage</b> at 5 °C. Semen quality parameters viz, motility (%), plasma membrane integrity (%), livability (%) and acrosomal integrity (%) were assessed at 0, 3, 6, 24 and 48 hours of storage. A time dependent decrease was observed in motility, plasma membrane and acrosomal integrity in all experimental extenders during the storage period. However, the Turkey semen extender was found significantly (P< 0. 05) superior for protecting all aforementioned semen quality parameters compared to the Beltsville Poultry, Lake, EK, Tselutin Poultry and Chicken semen extenders. It is concluded that the Turkey semen extender can be used efficiently for the liquid storage of Indian Red Jungle Fowl spermatozoa at 5 °C...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to evaluate the influence of different storage temperature on rooster sperm motility. Semen was collected once a week from Lohmann Light breeder males into prepared sterile tube. The heterospermic pool was diluted at the ratio of 1 : 100 in a commercial avian extender, divided into two aliquots and incubated at 8 °C or 37 °C. The quality of semen samples were evaluated using CASA system (Sperm Vision™) after 30, 60 and 120 min of incubation. We observed significantly (P< 0. 05) the highest progressive motility of rooster sperm after 60 min of spermatozoa incubation at 8 °C, that was also significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in comparison to spermatozoa incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Basing on the observed results, we hypothesized that law temperatures (about 8 °C) {{would be better for}} long-term storage of rooster spermatozoa. Further experiments with different <b>semen</b> diluents and <b>storage</b> temperatures and intervals are required in order to prove our hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of adding different doses of insulin to swine semen processed and stored at 15 ºC. The experiment used sixteen ejaculates from four commercial breeding pigs, distributed in a randomized block design (ejaculate) with split plot along time (0, 24, 48 and 72 hours of storage) with four treatments (insulin levels - 0. 0 4. 0 8. 0 and 12. 0 IU per dose) and 16 repetitions. The experimental unit was made of two insemination doses of 100 mL each, with 3 × 10 (9) spermatozoids. Insulin used was NPH-human, added at the time of processing the doses. The addition of insulin did not affect motility, sperm viability, the percentage of abnormal cells, the osmotic resistance or the degradation rate of motility in 120 minutes. There was a linear decrease in <b>semen</b> quality over <b>storage</b> time, regardless of insulin levels. The addition of insulin at the mentioned concentrations does not influence the quality of insemination dose in pigs...|$|R
