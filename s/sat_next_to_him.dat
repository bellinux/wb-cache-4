500|$|Once the {{legislature}} convened in 1922, the inexperience of the Premier and his caucus was further laid bare. [...] Greenfield, {{devastated by the}} sudden death of his wife, turned in a poor performance. Faced with an aggressive attack by new Liberal leader John R. Boyle, Greenfield relied heavily on Attorney General John Brownlee, who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in the Legislature, to provide the defense. [...] The session got off to an inauspicious start: Greenfield nominated the government's preferred candidate for speaker, Oran McPherson, only to have one of his backbenchers, Alex Moore, nominate Independent Conservative John Smith Stewart; Stewart spared the government embarrassment by declining the nomination.|$|E
500|$|Skeptics {{have criticized}} the {{lighting}} conditions of Home's séances. Home and his followers claimed {{that some of the}} séances took place in [...] "light" [...] but this {{was nothing more than a}} few candles, or some glow from a fireplace or open window. Home would adjust the lighting to his needs with no objections from his séance sitters. For example, there is this report from a witness: [...] "The room was very dark... Home's hands were visible only as a faint white heap". Home selected the séance sitters who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> his hands and feet were not controlled and according to Frank Podmore [...] "no precautions were taken against trickery." ...|$|E
500|$|While Raff {{was able}} to offer [...] "practical {{suggestions}} [...] which were of great value to Liszt", {{there may have been}} [...] "a basic misunderstanding" [...] of the nature of their collaboration. Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them." [...] Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me." ...|$|E

As to 'is being a 'eathen, well, throwin' {{stones at}} a church, as the sayin' is, don't make a Christian of you. There's Christians I've met as couldn't do {{themselves}} much 'arm by changing their religion; and as to cleanliness, well, I've never met but one, and 'e was a washerwoman, and I'd rather 'ave <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>'im</b> in a third-class carriage on a Bank 'Oliday than <b>next</b> <b>to</b> some of 'em.|$|R
50|$|The Tibetan legend {{said that}} a revered high lama, Atisha, was walking alone when he found a man {{starving}} and near death. After looking around and unable to find food for the old man, he cut flesh from his own body and offered it to the starving man. But the man refused to eat the his flesh. Being depressed and not knowing how else to help the man nearing death, Lama Atisha <b>sat</b> down <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> At that point there was a blinding bright white light and before Atisha appeared Chenrezig of Compassion. He told Lama Atisha {{that he was going}} to manifest himself as the God of Wealth, Jambhala, and assure that those in poverty would suffer no longer.|$|R

60|$|The Vicar {{felt that}} the heavens had fallen. He sat {{crumpled}} up in his chair, a shattered man. Lady Hammergallow <b>sat</b> down <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> without appearing <b>to</b> see <b>him.</b> She was breathing heavily, but her face was terribly calm. Everyone sat down. Was the Angel grossly ignorant or only grossly impertinent? The Angel was vaguely aware of some frightful offence, aware that in some mysterious way he had ceased to be {{the centre of the}} gathering. He saw reproachful despair in the Vicar's eye. He drifted slowly towards the window in the recess {{and sat down on the}} little octagonal Moorish stool by the side of Mrs Jehoram. And under the circumstances he appreciated at more than its proper value Mrs Jehoram's kindly smile. He put down the violin in the window seat.|$|R
60|$|Waterbuck, Q.C., {{had barely}} screwed round on his elbow {{to chat with}} his Junior before Mr. Justice Bentham himself appeared--a thin, rather hen-like man, with a little stoop, clean-shaven under his snowy wig. Like {{all the rest of}} the court, Waterbuck rose, and {{remained}} on his feet until the judge was seated. James rose but slightly; he was already comfortable, and had no opinion of Bentham, having <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> but one <b>to</b> <b>him</b> at dinner twice at the Bumley Tomms'. Bumley Tomm was rather a poor thing, though he had been so successful. James himself had given him his first brief. He was excited, too, for he had just found out that Bosinney was not in court.|$|R
5000|$|Subsequently {{he worked}} for Remington Rand, on the Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC), before leaving for Mexico and other travel. His parents offered him $100 per month to return to college, so he took the money and [...] "bought some jazz records and lived on $13 per month," [...] and {{returned}} to Los Angeles, living for some time in Topanga Canyon, where he met the artists Wallace Berman and Robert Alexander {{on the occasion of}} his 20th birthday. Herms helped Wallace Berman hang his first show in 1957 at Ferus Gallery. Reportedly, Herms decided to become an artist when a transient <b>sat</b> down <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in a Sacramento bus depot and said, [...] "There's the makers, the takers, and the fakers. Which will you be?" [...] Herms did not have a formal art school education, yet he has been called the [...] "godfather of West Coast assemblage art." [...] During the late 1950s, Herms resided {{in a number of different}} cities in California, including Berkeley, Larkspur and Hermosa Beach before returning for a short period of time to Topanga in 1961. In 1959, Herms became an original member of Bruce Conner's Rat Bastard Protective Association ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nay, sing up, friend," [...] quoth Little John, who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> patting him {{upon the}} shoulder. [...] "Thou hast a fair, round, mellow voice; {{let us have}} a touch of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the hour}} {{preceding}} the attack, 13 people including the shooter {{participated in the}} Bible study. [...] According to the accounts of people who talked to survivors, when the shooter walked into the historic African-American church, he immediately asked for Pinckney and <b>sat</b> down <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> initially listening <b>to</b> others during the study. He started to disagree when they began discussing Scripture. Eventually, after waiting for the other participants to begin praying, {{he stood up and}} pulled a gun from a fanny pack, aiming it at 87-year-old Susie Jackson. Jackson's nephew, 26-year-old Tywanza Sanders, tried <b>to</b> talk <b>him</b> down and asked him why he was attacking churchgoers. The shooter responded, [...] "I have to do it. You rape our women and you're taking over our country. And you have to go." [...] When he expressed his intention to shoot everyone, Sanders dove in front of Jackson and was shot first. The suspect then shot the other victims, all the while shouting racial epithets. He also reportedly said, [...] "Y'all want something to pray about? I'll give you something to pray about." [...] He reloaded his gun five times. Sanders' mother and his five-year-old niece, both attending the study, survived the shooting by pretending to be dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be seated," [...] {{said this}} personage, in no unpleasing voice, {{and he pointed}} to the chair {{opposite}} <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Vivian took the vacated seat of the Vice-President, who moved himself to the right. [...] "Be seated, and whoever you may be, welcome! If our words be few, think not that our welcome is scant. We are not much given to speech, holding it for a principle that if a man's mouth be open, it should be for the purpose of receiving that which cheers a man's spirit; not of giving vent to idle words, which, so far as we have observed, produce no other effect save filling the world with crude and unprofitable fantasies, and distracting our attention when we are on the point of catching those flavours which alone make the world endurable. Therefore, briefly, but heartily, welcome! Welcome, Sir Stranger, from us, and from all: and first from us, the Grand Duke of Johannisberger." [...] Here his Highness rose, and pulled out a large ruby tumbler from the file. Each of those present did the same, without, however, rising, and the late Vice-President, who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Vivian, invited <b>him</b> <b>to</b> follow their example.|$|R
40|$|I {{walked into}} a room with its lights glaring and {{television}} blaring, a room where a man I had never met before would take his final breath two hours later. The attending nurse kindly dimmed the lights {{and turned off the}} television. I <b>sat</b> down <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> I felt panic. I felt sadness, and I felt peace. This individual would have passed without me knowing, yet I was there with him; he wouldn’t be alone. The No One Dies Alone (NODA) chapter at Jefferson launched in May, 2016. It launched as a vision in which students of Thomas Jefferson University would volunteer their time to offer their compassionate companionship to dying individuals who would otherwise be alone. Our chapter’s mission originated in Eugene, Oregon back in 2001 after a nurse, Sandra Clarke, CCRN, was unable to offer her dying patient the companionship he had requested and she felt he deserved. She fought vigilantly for her vision, and now over 300 programs exist nationwide with Sandra’s vision at their core; Jefferson is proudly home to one more – the only student volunteer chapter about which we are aware. Jefferson’s highly interprofessional and supportive community allowed for students to oversee NODA’s growth, development, and success. As student volunteers, we come together from all professions to offer compassionate care to individuals in need. Our service offers respite to our hard-working nurses who want to see their patients receive the best care possible, and to the families who cannot be present. While our primary goal is offering our supportive presence to those who are dying who would otherwise be alone, our program is truly special, and our service extends far beyond any mission statement ever could...|$|R

60|$|They {{reached the}} church. Fred {{led the way}} to the pew, {{followed}} by the cousin, then Anna. She felt very conspicuous and important. Somehow, this young man gave her away to other people. He stood aside and let her pass to her place, then <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her.

60|$|The {{landlord}} was all obsequious, and a relay {{of about}} seven negroes, old and young, male and female, little and big, were soon whizzing about, like a covey of partridges, bustling, hurrying, treading on each other's toes, and tumbling over each other, in their zeal to get Mas'r's room ready, while he seated himself easily {{on a chair}} {{in the middle of the}} room, and entered into conversation with the man who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
