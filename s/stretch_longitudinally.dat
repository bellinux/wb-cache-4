40|$|The Eskimos are {{a remarkably}} {{successful}} group of mankind. Their {{ability to adapt}} to difficult circumstances and to expand is accurately reflected in their geographical distribution. They <b>stretch</b> <b>longitudinally</b> around a large sector of the circumpolar world, and latitudinally from the subarctic into the high Arctic. With their closest relatives, the Aleuts, they occupy the longest linear distance of any single group in the world. Although this unique geographical distribution provides objective and conclusive evidence {{of their ability to}} expand, rather than simply survive, it does not automatically elucidate the processes of adaptation which are responsible. We must look at individual Eskimos and at communities of Eskimos through the methods of many disciplines, and then sift and integrate this information within the larger context of their population systems. Their physical abilities, their inventiveness, and their cheerfulness are as well known to the world as the words “Eskimo, ” “igloo, ” and “kayak. ” However, we do not know to what extent there are organic connections between physical endowments, genetic variability, inventive ingenuity, and cheerfulness of dis...|$|E
40|$|Propagation of {{a curved}} shock {{is governed by}} a system of shock ray {{equations}} which is coupled to an innite system of transport equations along these rays. For a twodimensional weak shock, {{it has been suggested}} that this system can be approximated by a hyperbolic system of four partial dierential equations in a ray coordinate system, which consists of two independent variables (ξ,t) where the curves t = constant give successive positions of the shock and ξ= constant give rays. The equations show that shock rays not only <b>stretch</b> <b>longitudinally</b> due to nite amplitude on a shock front but also turn due to a non-uniform distribution of the shock strength on it. These changes nally lead to a modication of the amplitude of the shock strength. Since discontinuities in the form of kinks appear on the shock, it is necessary to study the problem by using the correct conservation form of these equations. We use such a system of equations in conservation form to construct a total-variation-bounded nite dierence scheme. The numerical solution captures converging shock fronts with a pair of kinks on them - the shock front emerges without the usual folds in the caustic region. The shock strength, even when the shock passes through the caustic region, remains so small that the small-amplitude theory remains valid. The shock strength ultimately decays with a well-dened geometrical shape of the shock front - a pair of kinks which separate a central disc from a pair of wings on the two sides. We also study the ultimate shape and decay of shocks of initially periodic shapes and plane shocks with a dent and a bulge...|$|E

However, the bias cut dress has problem of satisfying the intended garment size spec. This problem occurs from various sources. The main {{reason is that the}} bias-cut fabric tends to stretch on longitudinal direction and to shrink horizontal direction when it was hung on the body. The goal {{of this study was to}} develop a bias-cut dress pattern making method satisfying the intended garment size spec. The researchers developed the geometrical method of measuring dimensional change by calculating the compensation ratio of the fabric in true bias direction. The compensation ratio was calculated by applying draping ratio of the fabric. Three types of fabrics were used in the experiment. The warp and weft crossing angle of fabric was ranged from 78 ° to 82 °. The fabrics <b>stretched</b> <b>longitudinally</b> 6. 9 ～ 9. 9 % and shrank horizontally 7. 2 ～ 11. 0 %. The compensation ratio of the bias-cut pattern for sample dress was calculated for each fabric type. Two types of experimental bias-cut dress patterns were developed for each fabric. One pattern was made with applying full compensation ratio and the other one made with applying partial ratio of the fabric. Experimental dresses were made with these patterns. The results of the evaluation showed that the bias-cut dress pattern applying the partial compensation ratio was more appropriate than the pattern applying the full compensation ratio...|$|R

Given the rapid and concurrent alterations in the mechanical properties of edematous intestine observed {{with the development of}} edema, we hypothesize that mechanical forces may serve as a stimulus for the activation of certain signaling cascades. We sought to examine whether isolated similar magnitude mechanical forces induced the same signal transduction cascades associated with edema. METHODS: The distal intestine from adult male Sprague Dawley rats was <b>stretched</b> <b>longitudinally</b> for 2 h to 123 % its original length, which correlates with the interstitial stress found with edema. We compared wet-to-dry ratios, myeloperoxidase activity, nuclear signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT) - 3 and nuclear factor (NF) -kappa B DNA binding, STAT- 3 phosphorylation, myosin light chain phosphorylation, baseline and maximally stimulated intestinal contractile strength, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and sodium hydrogen exchanger 1 - 3 messenger RNA (mRNA) in stretched and adjacent control segments of intestine. RESULTS: Mechanical stretch did not induce intestinal edema or an increase in myeloperoxidase activity. Nuclear STAT- 3 DNA binding, STAT- 3 phosphorylation, and nuclear NF-kappa B DNA binding were significantly increased in stretched seromuscular samples. Increased expression of sodium hydrogen exchanger 1 was found but not an increase in iNOS expression. Myosin light chain phosphorylation was significantly decreased in stretched intestine as was baseline and maximally stimulated intestinal contractile strength. CONCLUSION: Intestinal stretch, in the absence of edema/inflammatory/ischemic changes, leads to the activation of signaling pathways known to be altered in intestinal edema. Edema may initiate a mechanotransductive cascade that is responsible for the subsequent activation of various signaling cascades known to induce contractile dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|In {{the northeastern}} part of Lutzow-Holm Bay, there extends a {{continental}} shelf about 60 km wide. Bathymetric charts {{of the shelf}} were drawn, using numerous sounding data obtained by the icebreaker FUJI {{during the period of}} 1965 - 1970 and by the author in 1968. As a result of analyses of the charts, the author concluded on the geomorphology of the shelf as follows : 1) The shelf near Syowa Station is generally 100 - 200 meters deep. It becomes deeper gradually toward the offing and reaches to the depth of 350 - 400 meters at the outer margin of the shelf. 2) In the inner part of the shelf, there is a highly glaciated sea floor with low rises and broad troughs. One of the most striking features of this sea floor is linear arrangement of rises and troughs with two trends which are due to those of the schistosity and joint structures of bedrocks. 3) The bottom of the broad glacial troughs is about 400 meters deep near the coast and becomes shallower toward the offing, showing an undulating longitudinal profiles. Such troughs are recognized only in the inner part of the shelf at least 20 km off the coast. 4) Close to the coast, there are narrow channels deeper than the broad troughs. They are classified into two kinds; one <b>stretches</b> <b>longitudinally</b> {{from the front of the}} present glaciers and another runs parallel to the coast. The latter seems to be controlled by rock structures, such as schistosity, whereas there is no evidence of recent tectonic movements related to their origin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMicrotubules (MT), {{along with}} a variety of {{associated}} motor proteins, are involved in a range of cellular functions including vesicle movement, chromosome segregation, and cell motility. MTs are assemblies of heterodimeric proteins, αβ-tubulins, the structure of which has been determined by electron crystallography of zinc-induced, pacilitaxel-stabilized tubulin sheets. These data provide a basis for examining relationships between structural features and protein function. Here, we study the fluctuation dynamics of the tubulin dimer with the aim of elucidating its functional motions relevant to substrate binding, polymerization/depolymerization and MT assembly. A coarse-grained model, harmonically constrained according to the crystal structure, is used to explore the global dynamics of the dimer. Our results identify six regions of collective motion, comprised of structurally close but discontinuous sequence fragments, observed only in the dimeric form, dimerization being a prerequisite for domain identification. Boundaries between regions of collective motions appear to act as linkages, found primarily within secondary-structure elements that lack sequence conservation, but are located at minima in the fluctuation curve, at positions of hydrophobic residues. Residue fluctuations within these domains identify the most mobile regions as loops involved in recognition of the adjacent regions. The least mobile regions are associated with nucleotide binding sites where lethal mutations occur. The functional coupling of motions between and within regions identifies three global motions: torsional and wobbling movements, en bloc, between the α- and β-tubulin monomers, and <b>stretching</b> <b>longitudinally.</b> Further analysis finds the antitumor drug pacilitaxel (TaxotereR) to reduce flexibility in the M loop of the β-tubulin monomer; an effect that may contribute to tightening lateral interactions between protofilaments assembled into MTs.

30|$|The {{intracellular}} {{space of a}} cardiomyocyte is dominated by structures which facilitate the contraction of the muscle. Normal contraction {{is the result of}} actin and myosin protein filaments sliding past each other after an action potential triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The actin and myosin filaments are aligned in a side-by-side arrangement by an accessory protein called titin (Guyton & Hall 2006; Nelson & Cox 2008) (characterized as “very springy” (Guyton & Hall 2006)). These bundles of aligned contractile filaments (which may be visualized on an electron micrograph (Nelson & Cox 2008)) give the {{intracellular space}} a preferred direction of elasticity. We regard stresses which stretch the intracellular space as also <b>stretching</b> the <b>longitudinally</b> directed actin-myosin complexes and the covalently bonded titin proteins. While the intracellular space will exhibit some background isotropy, the relative displacements of two coupled isotropic spaces are not particularly interesting, so we will focus our attention on the anisotropic nature of the intracellular space.|$|R

30|$|Nanofibers {{have also}} been applied to {{ligament}} regeneration. Unlike other tissues, tendon and ligament have a very low propensity to regenerate due to their high ECM density and low vascularity [63]. The body typically relies on scar tissue mediated healing process which is inadequate to replace the functions of damaged or diseased tendon and ligament. As mentioned, owning to its high porosity nature, nanofiber allows for high cell infiltration rate and also allow for uniaxial alignment to mimic the anisotropic structure of native tendon and ligament. In this report [64], Ouyan and coworkers demonstrated that by seeding human tendon progenitor cells (hTSPCs) on top of aligned Poly(lactic acid) (PLLA) nanofibers higher tendon gene expression similar to native tissue was observed compare to randomly aligned fiber control which is significantly lower. The reason is that ECM production of tendon and ligament fibroblasts have specific uniaxial direction.

This retreat is especially prominent in the western Arctic Ocean, adjacent to the Pacific (Fig. 1). The Northwind Ridge (NR), <b>longitudinally</b> <b>stretched</b> north of Alaskan margin, provides a strategically located seafloor structure for investigating the history of sedimentary and related climatic environments in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean. Initial investigation indicates that sediments in cores recovered from the NR contain more calcareous microfossils (primarily foraminifers) than in many {{other areas of the}} Arctic Ocean, which makes these cores more valuable for paleo-proxy studies. More specifically, core P 1 - 93 ARP 23 (Fig. 2) contains foraminifers in bottom sections of the core estimated to extend beyond Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 16 (- 650 ka). This is significant, as these foraminifers are preserved below the level of usual calcite undersaturation in other Arctic cores and contain assemblages and extinct species found in no other core. Overall, foraminiferal data indicate lower sea-ice conditions in the early Quaternary, preceding the growth of a supersized Laurentide ice-sheet.

Localized intrusions through cusps are also observed. On the nightside an access into the magnetosphere depends on the IMF orientation.

40|$|Broad area cooling shields are a mass-efficient {{alternative}} to conductively cooled thermal radiation shielding. The shield would actively intercept {{a large portion}} of incident thermal radiation and transport the heat away using cryogenic helium gas. The design concept consists of a conductive and conformable surface that maximizes heat transfer and formability. Broad Area Cooled (BAC) shields could potentially provide considerable mass savings for spaceflight applications by eliminating the need for a rigid thermal radiation shield for cryogen tanks. The BAC consists of a network of capillary tubes that are thermally connected to a conductive shield material. Chilled helium gas is circulated through the network and transports unwanted heat away from the cryogen tanks. The cryogenic helium gas is pumped and chilled simultaneously using a specialized pulse-tube cryocooler, which further improves the mass efficiency of the system. By reducing the thermal environment temperature from 300 to 100 K, the radiative heat load on a cryogen tank could be reduced by an order of magnitude. For a cryogenic liquid propellant scenario of oxygen and hydrogen, the boiloff of hydrogen would be significantly reduced and completely eliminated for oxygen. A major challenge in implementing this technology on large tanks is that the BAC system must be easily scalable from lab demonstrations to full-scale missions. Also, the BAC shield must be conformable to complex shapes like spheres without losing the ability to maintain constant temperature throughout. The initial design maximizes thermal conductivity between the capillary tube and the conductive radiation shielding by using thin, corrugated aluminum foil with the tube running transverse to the folds. This configuration has the added benefit of enabling the foil to <b>stretch</b> and contract <b>longitudinally.</b> This allows the BAC to conform to the complex curvature of a cryogen tank, which is key to its success. To demonstrate a BAC shield system with minimal impact to current cryogen tank designs, the shielding must be applied after the final assembly of the tank and supporting structure. One method is to pre-fabricate the shield in long strips. A spool of corrugated aluminum foil with a thermally sunk aluminum capillary running through the center could then be simply wound around the cryogen tanks and encapsulated within the multi-layer insulation (MLI) blanket. Then, on orbit, the BAC would intercept thermal radiation coming in through the MLI and transport it away from the cryogen tanks. An optimization of the design could be done to take into account mass savings from thinner MLI blankets, eliminating solid thermal shields, and ultimately, a reduction in the required cryogen tank size...|$|R

Tri osnovne zone, izdužene u smjeru sjeverozapad, jugoistok, dominiraju u prostornoj slici naseljenosti Podravine - i kroz povijest i danas. Najatraktivnija zona, koja ima i najgušću naseljenost i najvažniju prometnu mrežu, ocjedito je područje würmskih i dijelom holocenih terasa. Sjeverno od tog područja je slabije naseljena zona dravskog poloja, a južno najslabije naseljena zona brežuljkastog neogenog (kvartarnog) pobrđa. U radu su temeljito razrađene značajke geološko-geomorfoloških, hidrogeografskih i klimatskih osobitosti te specifičnih ekosustava. Uz to, spomenuti su osnovni razlozi promjena u atraktivnostima za naseljavanje pojedinih zona kroz povijest i prostorna diferencijacija u sadašnjosti. 1. The {{subject of}} the {{significance}} of natural-geographic factors for the spatial distribution {{of the population of the}} upper Croatian Podravina region can only be scientifically analysed by applying a multi-disciplinary approach. This pertains above all to the linking of geographic (geo-ecological) and historiographic (geo-historical) methodologies. Based on the experiences of some contemporary Croatian eco-historians and geo-ecologists (D. Roksandić, H. Petrić, M. Kolar, V. Rogić, M. Martinez, A. Bognar and others), and foreign researchers (E. Häckel, F. Brandel, P. Engle, G. R. Taylor, W. Petersen and others), individual natural-geographic characteristics and their co-relation with the levels and changes in the distribution of the population have been systematically elaborated. 2. The permeation or symbiosis of physical-geographic characteristics and the spatial picture of the inhabitation of the Podravina region is most pronounced in the geological-geomorphological characteristics of the area. In the geological sense Podravina is in the so-called Drava river depression, where palaeogene stratum have settled deep on the fractured old Pannonian mass. These strata as up to five and six thousand metres deep in the middle of the depression, and drilling wells have reached as deep in search of natural gas and crude oil. To the south are hillocks of the neogene stratum of the Bilogora region and the northern slopes of Kalnik and a part of the Toplica highlands. That was the basis on which today’s relief was formed during the pleistocene and holocene. Of particular importance was the change in climate at the turn of the two periods, and the erosive and tectonic activity during the last 12 thousand years or so, i. e. from the start of the neolithic to the present day. As a result of the geo-morphological and pedological characteristics, the relief in the upper Croatian Podravina region <b>stretches</b> zonally, <b>longitudinally</b> extended in the direction north-west to south-east. Basic longitudinal inhabitation zones have also formed under this fundamental relief influence. Three basic inhabitation zones have been formed in the Podravina region in the past based on the underlying north-south hypsometric profile: 1. In the Drava river depression, 2. On the terraced holocene and würm terraces (two inter-zones can also be established – the holocene and contact würm), 3. The denudation-accumulation relief of the low-lying hill country. Also important to the zonal stretching of the spatial inhabitation are the climatic characteristics in the past (today a moderately warm humid climate Cfb), and especially the fundamental Podravina region ecosystems. Based on the preserved ecosystems it is possible, with a significant possibility for spatial positioning, to determine the extent of natural vegetation in the Podravina region throughout the past. 3. In the three basic inhabitation zones – the Drava river floodplain, the terraced lowlands and the low-lying hill country – the level of settlement density and the centres of settlements has changes significantly throughout the past. Along with changes in the distant past (above all because of varying climatic conditions), the strongest changes in the spatial distribution of population took place during the past two centuries, and especially in the new processes of industrialisation. The differences in the number of settlements in the cited three inhabitation zones are not that great. In the hill country zone there are now as many as 65 settlements in existence or 37. 6 percent of the total number of places, 80 settlements in the most attractive terraced zone or 46. 7 percent. That is, however, only an orientational indicator. What is important is the size and structure of the settlements, and changes in the size of the population through history. Here the differences between the zones are very significant. Inhabitation in the Drava river floodplain is relatively poor and has changed in the past, and has in the past half century or so seen pronounced depopulation: in 1771 there were 8, 124 inhabitants living in the settlements of the floodplain or 17. 7 percent of the total population of the Podravina region, and 16, 050 souls in 2001 or just 13. 8 percent. The increase in the number of inhabitants in those 230 years was 1998 percent in total. Even fewer inhabitants lived in the scattered settlements of the low-lying hill country: 6, 099 or 13. 4 percent in 1771, and 14, 438 or 12. 4 percent in 2001, with a total growth of 236 percent. From this data alone the absolute domination of inhabitation on the holocene and würm terraces can be conjectured, which was logically to have been expected. In this basic contact zone, then, where the largest settlements and main traffic network is concentrated, there were 31, 565 inhabitants or 68. 9 percent living in 1777, and as many as 85, 717 inhabitants or 73. 8 percent in 2001. The increase in the level of inhabitation on the attractive terraces, then, was the fastest and amounted, in the cited comparative period, to 272 percent (table 1). In analysing the growth of the population of rural and urban settlements the logical conclusion can be made that the towns grew demographically up to several times faster than the villages, with the domination of Koprivnica. It is important to underline that all three of the Podravina region urban settlements are, in fact, situated on the attractive würm terraces. The latest demographic trends in Podravina, however, are indicative of an intensive depopulation process, particularly of the rural settlements. Some of them are already at the point of extinction. 4. An analysis of the demographic trends in the Podravina region, and in particular the changes in the spatial picture of the inhabitation, has shown without a doubt that it is imperative that a thorough analysis also be carried out of the natural-geographic factors and it that way to determine their significance and effect on spatial demographic development. It is, namely, evident that natural-geographic factors, and the factors closely related to them, have a greater effect on changes in the spatial picture of inhabitation than has been previously considered. Of course, it is essential subsequently to compare and to supplement these natural-geographic factors with all social or societal factors, and it is only on the basis of that kind of multi-disciplinary analysis that relevant explanations and conclusions can be arrived at...|$|R
