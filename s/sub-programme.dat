40|$|Land {{ownership}} in South Africa {{has long been}} a source of conflict. The history of forced removals and a racially skewed distribution of land resources have left the new government, which took over in 1994, with a complex and difficult legacy. The new government has developed a land reform programme with three major elements to address the situation of landlessness, tenure insecurity and poverty among black people. The three major elements can be defined as follows: The redistribution of land to the disadvantaged and poor for productive and residential purposes; Land restitution, which covers restitution of land to those who had been forcefully removed from land after 1913 as a result of racially discriminatory laws and practices and Tenure reform to those whose tenure of land is legally insecure. The specific {{purpose of this study is}} to review the redistribution of land in terms of the implementation of the LRAD (Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development) <b>Sub-programme,</b> which was launched in August 2001. In the first few years of the delivery of LRAD (2001 to 2003), the <b>sub-programme</b> made substantial progress and the DLA (Department of Land Affairs) referred to LRAD as the DLA’s flagship redistribution <b>sub-programme.</b> However, according to academics (Hall, 2003 and 2004; Jacobs, 2003; Wegeriff, 2004 and Lahiff, 2003) and the media (Black Business Quarterly, 2006 and Business Report: Sunday Independent, 2006), the pace of the implementation of LRAD is also slow and the sustainability of many land redistribution projects is poor. The purpose of this study is to review the pace of implementation and the quality of projects transferred through the LRAD <b>Sub-programme</b> in Gauteng Province. Three main factors are identified in this study that contribute to the slow pace of land redistribution in terms of the LRAD <b>Sub-programme.</b> These factors are the bureaucratic processes that government follows to implement LRAD projects, the limited size of the LRAD grants and the formation of group projects. The mentioned critiques and the results of this study also show that there are a variety of factors that have an impact on the sustainability/quality of projects. These factors are: limited financing of projects, lack of start-up capital, lack of agricultural skills, poor design of projects, lack of post-transfer support, group dynamics, crime, and a disregard for environmental factors. To obtain the relevant research information for this study a variety of documents and books regarding land reform and the LRAD <b>Sub-programme</b> were reviewed. Additional information was obtained from the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) and AgriSA with regard to agriculture in Gauteng. Beneficiaries from a sample of 15 LRAD projects and three officials from the Gauteng Provincial Land Reform Office were also interviewed to get their opinions about the pace of implementation of redistribution of projects through the LRAD <b>Sub-programme</b> and also the sustainability of these programmes. The reason for studying land reform in Gauteng is because of its unique features of farming. One of the unique features is the fact that farmland in Gauteng consists mostly of small farms and plots, which are easier for beneficiaries to purchase by means of the limited-size LRAD grants than are big farms in Limpopo, North West, Northern Cape, etc. Other positive features are the good quality of agricultural land, the availability of output markets and supply of inputs. There are also a number of negative factors, which include the facts that 97 % of province is urbanised, and that farmland is scarce and expensive. However, a detailed description of the study area is given in section 1. 4. Eventually the conclusion was reached that the implementation of LRAD projects in Gauteng is indeed slow because of certain problems in the process of land transfer through the LRAD <b>Sub-programme,</b> the limited LRAD grants compared to the increased land prices and the size of group projects. The mentioned factors that have an impact on the sustainability of LRAD projects are also reviewed through the fieldwork and it has been discovered that it indeed has a big impact on the quality of these projects. The case studies provide a number of recommendations to address the factors impacting on the pace of land redistribution in the province and the factors impacting on sustainability. Some of the recommendations can be implemented by the Gauteng Provincial Land Reform Office itself. The other recommendations will need to be addressed nationally which can then have a positive influence on the delivery and the quality of the implementation of LRAD projects on a national basis as well.

40|$|WHAT IS THE ELECTIVE SURGERY PROGRAMME? The Elective Surgery Programme (ESP) {{sets out}} to address how {{elective}} surgery can best be delivered by surgeons, anaesthetists and other health workers in partnership with their patients {{so that it is}} safe, efficient and cost effective. This will be delivered through a set of high quality and reproducible processes. This work is being carried out as one of the joint programmes between the HSE, the College of Surgeons and the College of Anaesthetists and is being led by Prof. Frank Keane and Dr Jeanne Moriarty. The Elective Surgery Programme has four sub-programmes. They are as follows: Average Length-of-Stay or AvLOS <b>sub-programme</b> Targets for elective ‘day’ and ‘stay’ procedures have been agreed with 14 surgical specialties. These targets will save bed days and reduce surgical waiting lists. Based on 2009 activity potential savings are in the order of 41, 500 bed days and a reduction in waiting times for patients. The incentive for participation by surgeons, therefore, will be the provision of protected beds. See under “What is AvLOS?” There are a number of ways these targets for length-of-stay can be achieved. The “Elective Surgery Model of Care” outlines an agreed set of guidelines for pre-admission assessment clinics, day surgery, day-of-surgery admissions and discharge planning, each of which has the potential to reduce average length-of-stay. The document is designed to help develop local care pathways and it aims to help all hospital staff including management, doctors, nurses and ancillary staff. (See attached) Audit <b>sub-programme</b> The third element of the Elective Surgery Programme is Audit. Simply shortening hospital stay as a goal on its own is not appropriate without knowing the outcomes of the care provided. RCSI, together with the HSE, is introducing a National Audit of Surgical Mortality which will examine all deaths occurring during surgical care (See under “What is IASM?”) as well as a Joint Register (See under “What is the Joint Register”) Theatre Journey <b>sub-programme</b> The final element of the Elective Surgery Programme plans to introduce and implement the Productive Theatre Programme, also known as ‘TPOT’. The operating theatre is a common pathway for most surgical patients. For reasons of safety, efficiency and cost containment it is important that this resource is used effectively. The TPOT programme is a comprehensive package designed by NHS Innovation. (See under “What is TPOT?”) In summary, the Elective Surgery Programme aims to improve the patient journey along the elective surgical pathway by delivering on access, quality and cost. The planning stage has been completed but implementation, the hard bit, is yet to come. It will require very close co-operation between the Colleges and the HSE, and regional and hospital management, clinical directors and, most importantly, surgeons, anaesthetists, nursing and ancillary staff...|$|E
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarSediments in the {{harbours}} of Rotterdam contain {{relatively large}} amounts of naturally occurring radionuclides resulting from emissions of the ore-processing industries (Be 88, Be 92). Using harbour sludge as a landfill for polders has locally caused the Ra- 226 contents of the soil {{to be a factor}} of 4 higher than the expected Ra- 226 background. In polders where Ra- 226 was measured, the Ra- 226 surplus was found to be proportional to the cadmium contents (MO 92). Data on cadmium contents are available for many polders and therefore, cadmium may be useful as a tracer for enhanced levels of Ra- 226. Enhanced levels of Ra- 226 may cause higher radon concentrations in dwellings that are built on these soils. Therefore, an extensive research programme is started to study the relation between the Ra- 226 contents of the soil and radon concentrations in dwellings. The Laboratory of Radiation Research of RIVM has proposed to set up a <b>sub-programme,</b> focusing on the sites where harbouw sludges have been dumped, with the following goals: 1) to investigate if there are dwellings with enhanced radon concentrations {{as a result of a}} Ra- 226 surplus and 2) to investigate if the relation between the Ra- 226 -surplus and the cadmium contents found is generally valid and useful. In this report we describe how this <b>sub-programme</b> may be set up and give specific advice on the answers to various choices. We propose a. o. to use soil samples from 30 polders to investigate the relation between the Ra- 226 surplus and the cadmium contents and to study in eight polders the possible consequences of enhanced Ra- 226 levels for the radon concentrations in dwellings. Because the radon measurements take one year (four measurements averaged over three months) we propose that simple diagnostic measurements are made simultaneously with the radon measurements. These additional measurements include measurements of the groundwater table and of the effective ventilation pattern in the dwelling...|$|E
