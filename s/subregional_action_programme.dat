40|$|Abstract   This paper {{focuses on}} whether {{individual}} development plans {{as well as}} <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> are needed. Pupils in need of particular support get {{to be involved in}} an <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> – the school needs to provide any particular support a pupil needs. However, the individual development plan does not substitute the <b>action</b> <b>programme.</b> Thus an <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> as well as an individual development plan will be provided to students in need of particular support. The individual development plan follows the pupil throughout the entire education, regardless of whether its content changes, whilst the <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> pertains to a limited period of time. Pupils that are not in need of particular support are not likely to need to set goals for themselves in addition to those already set outside of school. An <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> is primarily concerned with affecting the conditions under which the pupils carry out their work.   The results of my study indicate that the individual development plan is yet another duty on part of the teachers, but with exceptionally scarce repayment. According to teachers at the school explored, the individual development plan generates little or no progress for pupils already involved in an <b>action</b> <b>programme.</b> A thoroughly crafted <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> is sufficient, according to teachers participating in the study. A pupil not in need of particular support will not need the individual development plan either, according to the teachers – it would merely be another paper to look at during development talks, but it would not benefit the pupil or the teacher...|$|R

A questionnaire, developed to measure attitudes towards the implementation of an affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programme,</b> was distributed to managers {{at all levels of}} management in a parastatal. Results supply evidence of a negative orientation towards affirmative action amongst younger managers. They hold the view that members of disadvantaged groups are favoured at their expense. Younger managers also perceive older managers not to have the necessary vision and skills to implement an affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> successfully. It is recommended that line management encourage communication between the different race groups, and develop positive attitudes and expectations towards the employers, the affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> and the various jobs available...|$|R
40|$|Trade-offs between {{competitive}} {{priorities are}} {{often seen as}} exogenous – managers accept them as a given downside while simultaneously addressing multiple competitive priorities. However, some companies seem to face fewer trade-offs than others. The question is how companies reduce their trade-offs to successfully compete on multiple competitive priorities simultaneously. We address this question by theorising that bundles of <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> are needed to reduce trade-offs between competitive priorities. We examine four Swiss manufacturing plants and show how the selection of <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> influences the simultaneous competition on multiple competitive priorities. We show that successful competition on multiple competitive priorities does not happen by accident but is achieved by aligning competitive priorities, <b>action</b> <b>programmes,</b> infrastructural/structural changes and contextual factors...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Human Resource Management)) [...] Cape Technikon, 1996. Labour {{relations}} in South Africa is directly influenced by {{affirmative action in}} the work place, creating potential labour relations opportunities and threats within organisations. An investigation was done to ascertain the influence of affirmative action on labour relations. A comparative study of employer and trade union perceptions indicated a marked consensus between the two parties. The differences between the parties can be addressed by collective bargaining. A theoretical framework was developed, which demonstrated that worker participation and joint decision-making on affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> {{should be regarded as}} essential for the success of these programmes. Shortcomings in current affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> emanate from unilateral decision-making by management. A lack of legitimacy in affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> results from non-consultation with trade unions. This has a detrimental effect on the credibility of affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> and as a result no real employee development occurs. The labour relations climate is thus impaired. The research methodology included interviews (conducted with a number of academics, human resource managers and trade unionists) and postal questionnaires, which were completed by 231 managers (human resource and line managers) in both private and public organisations in the Western Cape...|$|R
