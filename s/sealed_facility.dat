5|$|Trapping {{of newly}} emerged insects: By <b>sealing</b> the storage <b>facilities,</b> newly emerged adults from seeds could be {{prevented}} from escaping to their overwintering sites {{to decrease the}} pest pressure at the next season. B. rufimanus could then be trapped and later killed, e.g., by fire. Healthy and damaged seeds can be sorted using an optic sorter. Additionally, a storage extended over two years enables all developing B. rufimanus to emerge before sowing and therefore avoids emergence in the field from contaminated seeds.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of compliant filament seals to jet engine secondary air systems {{has been shown}} to yield significant improvements in specific fuel consumption and improved emissions. One such technology, the leaf seal, provides comparable leakage performance to the brush seal but offers higher axial rigidity, significantly reduced radial stiffness, and improved compliance with the rotor. Investigations were carried out on the Engine <b>Seal</b> Test <b>Facility</b> at the University of Oxford into the behavior of a leaf seal prototype at high running speeds. The effects of pressure, speed, and cover plate geometry on leakage and torque are quantified. Earlier publications on leaf seals showed that air-riding at the contact interface might be achieved. Results are presented which appear to confirm that air-riding is taking place. Consideration is given to a possible mechanism for torque reduction at high rotational speeds...|$|R

40|$|NASA s Turbine <b>Seal</b> Test <b>Facility</b> {{is used to}} test air-to-air seals for use {{primarily}} in advanced jet engine applications. Combinations of high temperature, high speed, and high pressure limit the disk life, due to the concern of crack initiation in the bolt holes of the Grainex Mar-M 247 disk. The primary purpose of this current work is to determine an inspection interval to ensure safe operation. The current work presents high temperature fatigue strain-life data for test specimens cut from an actual Grainex Mar-M 247 disk. Several different strain-life models were compared to the experimental data including the Manson-Hirschberg Method of Universal Slopes, the Halford-Nachtigall Mean Stress Method, and the Modified Morrow Method. The Halford-Nachtigall Method resulted in only an 18 percent difference between predicted and experimental results.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and analytical fatigue life study {{was performed on}} the Grainex Mar-M 247 disk used in NASA s Turbine <b>Seal</b> Test <b>Facility.</b> To preclude fatigue cracks from growing to critical size in the NASA disk bolt holes due to cyclic loading at severe test conditions, a retirement-for-cause methodology was adopted to detect and monitor cracks within the bolt holes using eddy-current inspection. For the NASA disk material that was tested, the fatigue strain-life to crack initiation at a total strain of 0. 5 percent, a minimum to maximum strain ratio of 0, and a bolt hole temperature of 649 C was calculated to be 665 cycles using - 99. 95 percent prediction intervals. The fatigue crack propagation life was calculated to be 367 cycles after implementing a safety factor of 2 on life. Thus, the NASA disk bolt hole total life or retirement life was determined to be 1032 cycles at a crack depth of 0. 501 mm. An initial NASA disk bolt hole inspection at 665 cycles is suggested with 50 cycle inspection intervals thereafter to monitor fatigue crack growth...|$|R
40|$|A new <b>seal</b> test <b>facility</b> for {{measuring}} high-pressure seal rotor-dynamic characteristics {{has recently been}} made operational at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). This work is being sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). The fundamental concept embodied in this test apparatus is a double-spool-shaft spindle which permits independent control over the spin speed {{and the frequency of}} an adjustable circular vibration orbit for both forward and backward whirl. Also, the static eccentricity between the rotating and non-rotating test seal parts is easily adjustable to desired values. By accurately measuring both dynamic radial displacement and dynamic radial force signals, over a wide range of circular orbit frequency, one is able to solve for the full linear-anisotropic model's 12 coefficients rather than the 6 coefficients of the more restrictive isotropic linear model. Of course, one may also impose the isotropic assumption in reducing test data, thereby providing a valid qualification of which seal configurations are well represented by the isotropic model and which are not. In fact, as argued in reference (1), the requirement for maintaining a symmetric total system mass matrix means that the resulting isotropic model needs 5 coefficients and the anisotropic model needs 11 coefficients...|$|R
40|$|The {{fatigue crack}} growth {{behavior}} of Grainex Mar-M 247 is evaluated for NASA s Turbine <b>Seal</b> Test <b>Facility.</b> The facility {{is used to}} test air-to-air seals primarily for use in advanced jet engine applications. Because of extreme seal test conditions of temperature, pressure, and surface speeds, surface cracks may develop over time in the disk bolt holes. An inspection interval is developed to preclude catastrophic disk failure by using experimental fatigue crack growth data. By combining current fatigue crack growth results with previous fatigue strain-life experimental work, an inspection interval is determined for the test disk. The fatigue crack growth life of the NASA disk bolt holes {{is found to be}} 367 cycles at a crack depth of 0. 501 mm using a factor of 2 on life at maximum operating conditions. Combining this result with previous fatigue strain-life experimental work gives a total fatigue life of 1032 cycles at a crack depth of 0. 501 mm. Eddy-current inspections are suggested starting at 665 cycles since eddy current detection thresholds are currently at 0. 381 mm. Inspection intervals are recommended every 50 cycles when operated at maximum operating conditions...|$|R
