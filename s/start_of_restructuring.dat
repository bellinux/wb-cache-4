40|$|The {{first part}} of the study {{describes}} European sugar policy as a basis of analysis. Than it analyses costs and earnings of Czech sugar factories in the years 2006 [...] 2009. For the following years 2 alternative predictions of profit development have been made; one supposes sugar price stagnation and the other its decrease. In the seventh year after the supposed <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> the company is acknowledged {{on the basis of the}} "Free Cash [...] Flow to the Equity" model. The study, taking the company Eastern Sugar Czech Rep. as an example, also calculates the profit that restructuring of the sugar factory would bring. The second part of the study analyses the convenience of restructuring Czech sugar factories in the years 2006 and 2007. The author assumes on the basis of the fact, that only one company closed its sugar factories, inexpedience of the restructuring process. The empirical part of this thesis tries to verify this hypothesis. The analysis is done by calculating net value of future financial flows. The profit loss due to restructuring that the study discounts by a risk free interest rate represents the costs. The sugar house profits in the monitored years and the company value in the seventh year after restructuring start represent the earnings. The earnings are discounted by an alternative cost of own capital, published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade every year. In the end of empirical part the thesis confirmed its assumption about inexpedience of restructuring process in all assumed scenarios excepting beginning of restructuring process in 2006 even as sugar price falling to average level of the first two months of the year 2010...|$|E

50|$|Sudden departureMr Krasnostein and Ms Cosgrove were {{appointed}} by the previous Liberal Government and were charged with the responsibility <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> the organisation. This led to substantial job losses {{which resulted in the}} loss of many senior managers and experienced staff. Ms Cosgrove announced the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>restructure</b> program in June 2012 after the Queens Birthday long weekend in an email to staff which describes how she had had a pleasant weekend at the spa town of Daylesford in regional Victoria and that job losses would be the product <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> that would begin immediately. It took some weeks for the story to be reported. Their sudden resignations on 3 March 2015 were announced in a State Government news release were said to have been due to the loss of confidence in WorkSafe's leadership and the handling of chemical contamination of the soil and a cancer cluster at the Country Fire Authority's Fiskville training facility near Ballarat, however there had been a number of other senior officials who had also resigned since the government's election including Country Fire Authority CEO Mick Bourke, and the board of Ambulance Victoria.

40|$|In urban {{governance}} literature, {{much attention}} is paid to the ideas and ideals of cooperation in policy networks, in particular to the motives and objectives of cooperation at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> urban <b>restructuring</b> processes. However, little consideration has been given to the dynamics of working in partnerships or to the conditions for long-term joint capacity building. In this article, we call attention to these issues. The main question addressed is: Which factors contribute to long-term cooperation? We have elicited the information required to answer the question through in-depth interviews with professionals and residents' representatives working in six Dutch urban restructuring neighbourhoods. Although we found some attempts to build long-term joint working capacity to address residents' needs, the findings indicate that this endeavour is impeded by the dominance of a scaled neoliberal governance arrangement in Dutch urban restructuring that features a strong market rationality with fragmentation in policies, time, space and decision-making power. We show that this situation hampers success in integrally addressing residents' needs in urban restructuring neighbourhoods. We conclude that, for more inclusive and coherent policies, the abandonment of neoliberal rationalities in urban policies is a first requirement for developing a real joint working capacity to address residents' needs in distressed neighbourhood...|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} {{participants}} per course was dwindling as were the number of courses. Against this backdrop, the BMDC took a far-reaching strategic decision to introduce a number of year long, post-graduate diploma courses. Three such academic programmes — Post-Graduate Diploma in Marketing Management, Post-Graduate Diploma in Financial Management, Post-Graduate Diploma in Computer Science were introduced. Response to these new diploma programmes, particularly for computer science, was encouraging. During early nineties, {{in the context of}} opening up of the market, structural changes and private sector driven growth strategy for rapid development, requirement for qualified human resources was anticipated. Against that backdrop the Bangladesh Management Development Centre (BMDC) <b>started</b> the process <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> itself so as to enable it to offer academic programs designed to create professionals. It was in that light the Bangladesh Management Development Centre (BMDC) was converted into an institute-the Bangladesh Institute of Management (BIM) opening up opportunities to offer postgraduate degree programs in Business Administration like, Executive MBA, Masters in Human Resource Management etc. While Training, Research and Consultancy are the three mandated activities of BIM; the major thrust during the last decade has been on training and Post-Graduate Diploma Programmes.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the general principles <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> enterprises, submits various {{interpretations of the}} concept "restructuring" and states the content and activities <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> enterprises. Restructuring enterprises can be implemented according to certain stages. When negative tendencies for {{the activity of the}} enterprise become visible or the current economic and financial indices become unsatisfactory, the issue about a further possibility of proceeding with the activity of the enterprise is considered. Seeking for restructuring the enterprise, first, the expediency and possibilities of the actions taken must be well-grounded. Then, the conception <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> and directions for implementing it are fixed; they stipulate the selection of the form <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> the enterprise (anti-crisis management instrument). The selection <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> depends upon the chosen form of restructurization. The preparation of a business plan, including appropriate elements, serves as an important stage <b>of</b> <b>restructuring</b> the enterprise.
