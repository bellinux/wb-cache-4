40|$|Use of an {{industrial}} robot {{in the production}} process as a <b>spindle</b> <b>carrier</b> is currently an interesting topic. However, if the stiffness of the robot is not sufficient, various imprecisions may occur during machining. The article deals with monitoring and evaluating the impact of cutting conditions and positions of the workpiece in the working area on the machined surfaces oriented in orthogonal planes. The aim of the experiment was to analyse the precision of simple planar surfaces milled using a robot...|$|E

40|$|The 4 "t"h meeting aims to {{exchange}} {{the experience and}} knowledge of engineers during several presentations and discussions about new developments required for a reliable, time and cost reducing validation of the wheel/hub assembly. Tremendous development of the wheel performance, described by {{the ratio of the}} rated load (kg) versus the wheel weight (kg) had taken place during the last 5000 years. Starting from the ratio of 3 for wooden 2 -piece-disc-wheels in Mesopotamia it needed nearly 1000 years to increase the ratio to approx 5 at light-weight spoke wheels for fighting carriages, found in the grave of king Tutenchamon in Egypt. Modern light alloy wheels of commercial vehicles reach values up to 160 kg/kg. Additionally the comlex design of the modern systems for cars and commercial vehicles comprising wheel, brake, hub, bearing, <b>spindle</b> and hub <b>carrier,</b> including different materials and their treatment, fasteners, press-fits, require an appropriate testing procedure. The variable loading conditions, caused by operational wheel forces, brake and torque moments including heating, may result in changing tolerances and press-fits during operation and consequently in different damage mechanisms. This can be simulated in the Biaxial Wheel Test Machine, whereby corresponding load programs are necessary. An overview about all biaxial test machines in usage at the end of 1999 is shown in the introduction. The total number is 17 for cars, 7 for commercial vehicles and 1 for trains. The six presentations of this meeting were consequently concentrated on: (a) recommendations for a standardization of load programs of the German Wheel Committee, (b) the simulation of brake and torque events and (c) the possibility for a numerical stress analyses and fatigue life assessment.
