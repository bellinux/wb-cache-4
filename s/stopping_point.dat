5|$|The Grand Junction Canal {{opened in}} 1794, linking Uxbridge with Birmingham. By 1800 Uxbridge {{had become one}} of the most {{important}} market towns in Middlesex, helped by its status as the first <b>stopping</b> <b>point</b> for stagecoaches travelling from London to Oxford. The development of Uxbridge declined after the opening of the Great Western Railway in 1838, which passed through West Drayton. A branch line to Uxbridge was not built until 1904.|$|E

Then we define the notions of barrier <b>stopping</b> <b>points</b> by intersection and by self-intersection. We then prove that all regular intersection points of the integral curves running along the barrier are barrier <b>stopping</b> <b>points.</b> Then we present, on systems of two and three dimensions, examples where barriers with <b>stopping</b> <b>points</b> occur...|$|R
5|$|The Rose And Crown {{is at the}} {{southern}} end of Ipswich Road. It was established as a coaching inn in the 14th century and used as a <b>stopping</b> <b>point</b> for prisoners being transported from Europe and Suffolk to London. The building still contains two cells, retaining their original doors. The venue's fireplace dates from the Tudor period. To the north is Colchester's Magic Roundabout.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{a home for}} some species of birds, Surtsey has also {{been used as a}} stopping-off point for migrating birds, particularly those en-route between Europe and Iceland. Species that have been seen briefly on the island include whooper swans, various species of geese, and common ravens. Although Surtsey lies {{to the west of the}} main migration routes to Iceland, it has become a more common <b>stopping</b> <b>point</b> as its vegetation has improved. In 2008, the 14th bird species was detected with the discovery of a common raven's nest.|$|E
5|$|In {{later years}} trade and {{transport}} became more important. The surrounding area was discovered to have large phosphorus reserves which brought industry to Northallerton {{due to the}} easy trade routes. Lying on the main route between Edinburgh and London it became an important <b>stopping</b> <b>point</b> for coaches travelling the route, eventually superseded by {{the growth of the}} railways in the 19th century. Lying in the centre of a large rural area Northallerton was established as a market town in 1200 by Royal Charter, and there is still a market in the town today.|$|E

5|$|Mile4 is {{situated}} at Point aux Pins at the northernmost {{point of the}} island. Here, M-185 turns southerly, passing the state boat dock and a nature center before coming to British Landing at the intersection with British Landing Road. The area is a popular <b>stopping</b> <b>point</b> for tourists biking or walking M-185; it is the location where British troops came ashore during the Battle of Mackinac Island during the War of 1812. Located around British Landing are various amenities including restrooms, picnic tables, and a concession stand. M-185 continues along Maniboajo Bay and passes the mile5 marker near Radisson Point.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{is named}} for J. Johnston Pettigrew a Confederate General who lies buried in the family {{cemetery}} in the park. Pettigrew {{was one of the}} commanding officer's at the Battle of Gettysburg and led a company of soldiers at Pickett's Charge. He sustained mortal wounds during General Robert E. Lee's retreat from Gettysburg. The general, who grew up on a farm that adjoined Somerset Place, is buried with his father and grandfather. Their final resting place is a popular <b>stopping</b> <b>point</b> for visitors to the park.|$|E
5|$|This list {{of birds}} of Ontario {{includes}} all the bird species {{recorded in the}} Canadian province of Ontario {{as determined by the}} Ontario Bird Records Committee (OBRC). There are, as of April 2017, 495 species on this list, 291 of which are known to breed in the province. Ontario has a considerable variety of bird species. One of the factors in this diversity is the size and range of environments in Ontario. Another is the Great Lakes; many birds use the shores as a <b>stopping</b> <b>point</b> during migration.|$|E

5|$|Spain {{tried to}} regain control of Gibraltar, which Britain had {{declared}} a Crown colony, through military, diplomatic and economic pressure. Gibraltar was besieged and heavily bombarded during three wars between Britain and Spain but the attacks were repulsed on each occasion. By {{the end of the last}} siege, in the late 18th century, Gibraltar had faced fourteen sieges in 500 years. In the years after Trafalgar, Gibraltar became a major base in the Peninsular War. The colony grew rapidly during the 19th and early 20th centuries, becoming one of Britain's most important possessions in the Mediterranean. It was a key <b>stopping</b> <b>point</b> for vessels en route to India via the Suez Canal. A large British naval base was constructed there at great expense at the end of the 19th century and became the backbone of Gibraltar's economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Omaha boomed and busted through its early years. Omaha was a <b>stopping</b> <b>point</b> for {{settlers}} and prospectors heading west, either overland or via the Missouri River. The steamboat Bertrand sank north of Omaha {{on its way}} to the goldfields in 1865. Its massive collection of artifacts is on display at the nearby Desoto National Wildlife Refuge. The jobbing and wholesaling district brought new jobs, followed by the railroads and the stockyards. Groundbreaking for the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1863, provided an essential developmental boom for the city. The Union Pacific Railroad was authorized by the U.S. Congress to begin building westward railways in 1862; in January 1866 it commenced construction out of Omaha.|$|E
5|$|The abbey {{was sold}} to Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, in 1572, and then to his brother, Sir Edward Hastings, in 1590. It was Sir Edward who is through {{to have been the}} first of these owners to have {{actually}} lived at the abbey permanently: living in the gatehouse whilst the site was developed. Sir Edward's son Henry (who inherited the abbey in 1603) sold it to in 1613 to William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire; the mansion that had been built on the site thus became known as Cavendish House. The 1st Earl intended the abbey to be his main residence and so started to massively extend the mansion, with a new range added to the south and a large wing to the north. The family was massively wealthy with several other estates and stately homes; following the death of the 1st Earl, the family decided to use Chatsworth House as their principle residence: Cavendish House thus was only used as a <b>stopping</b> <b>point</b> on the way to London. The house gained full-time residency again in 1638, however, when it was used as a Dower house by Christiana Cavendish (née Bruce), widow of the 2nd Earl of Devonshire.|$|E

The first production vehicles, designated as British Rail Class 139, have a small onboard LPG motor to bring the flywheel up to speed. In practice, this could be an electric motor that need only connect to the power supply at <b>stopping</b> <b>points.</b> Alternatively, a motor at the <b>stopping</b> <b>points</b> could wind up the flywheel of each car as it stops.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} power, the extremist {{leaders of the}} {{revolution}} had begun constructing fortifications on Eetioneia, a dominant point in {{the entrance to the}} harbor of Piraeus, ostensibly to protect the harbor against an attack from the fleet at Samos. With internal dissent increasing, they joined these new fortifications to existing walls to form a redoubt defensible against attacks from land or sea, which contained a large warehouse into which the extremists moved most of the city's grain supply. Theramenes protested strongly against the building of this fortification, arguing that its purpose was not to keep the democrats out, but to be handed over to the Spartans; Thucydides testifies that his charges were not without substance, as the extremists were actually contemplating such an action. Initially cautious (as enemies of the regime had been executed before), Theramenes and his party were emboldened and galvanized into action by several events. First, a Peloponnesian fleet, ostensibly dispatched to assist anti-Athenian forces on Euboea, was moving slowly up the coast of the Peloponnese; Theramenes charged that this fleet was planning to seize the fortifications on Eetioneia, in collaboration with the extremists. Second, an Athenian militiaman, apparently acting on orders from conspirators higher in the ranks of the government, assassinated Phrynichus, the leader of the extremist faction. He escaped, but his accomplice, an Argive, was captured; the prisoner, under torture, refused to state the name of his employer. With the extremists unable to take effective action in this case, and with the Peloponnesian fleet overrunning Aegina (a logical <b>stopping</b> <b>point</b> on the approach to Piraeus), Theramenes and his party decided to act.|$|E
