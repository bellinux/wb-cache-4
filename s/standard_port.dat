2500|$|Madeira is a {{fortified}} wine, {{produced in}} the Madeira Islands; varieties may be sweet or dry. It has a history {{dating back to the}} Age of Exploration when Madeira was a <b>standard</b> <b>port</b> of call for ships heading to the New World or East Indies. To prevent the wine from spoiling, neutral grape spirits were added. However, wine producers of Madeira discovered, when an unsold shipment of wine returned to the islands after a round trip, that the flavour of the wine had been transformed by exposure to heat and movement. Today, Madeira is noted for its unique winemaking process which involves heating the wine and deliberately exposing the wine to some levels of oxidation. [...] Most countries limit {{the use of the term}} Madeira to those wines that come from the Madeira Islands, to which the European Union grants Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status.|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{began on}} September 28, [...] 1942, and the {{facility}} {{was built to}} a plan of a <b>standard</b> <b>port</b> war signal station by the Queensland Main Roads Commission. A road to the facility was constructed {{by a team of}} 25 men firstly constructing a road from Arcadia to what is now the Radical Bay turnoff on Horseshoe Bay Road, then continuing up into the hinterland ending at the camouflaged mountain-top facility. Major Tom Sherman, a fortress engineer working on the project, [...] on the advice of Tom Wetherell, a visiting officer from Townsville's Kissing Point barracks, extended the road onto Florence Bay as Wetherell [...] "could not accept the [...] would not have known all about it, the road stood out like a sore thumb and ended abruptly in a heap of camouflage nets and netting". The command post, observation post and gun emplacements were all heavily camouflaged with local foliage, camouflage netting and false rocks, constructed by laying concrete over a wire mesh structure to resemble the local granite boulders.|$|E

2500|$|The {{islands of}} Madeira {{have a long}} {{winemaking}} history, {{dating back to the}} Age of Exploration when Madeira was a <b>standard</b> <b>port</b> of call for ships heading to the New World or East Indies. To prevent the wine from spoiling, neutral grape spirits were added. On the long sea voyages, the wines would be exposed to excessive heat and movement which transformed the flavour of the wine. This was discovered by the wine producers of Madeira when an unsold shipment of wine returned to the islands after a round trip. Today, Madeira is noted for its unique winemaking process which involves heating the wine. The wine is placed in stainless steel vats that are heated via a serpentine method. Hot water, at a temperature between 45 and 50 degrees Celsius , runs through this serpentine system for a period of never less than three months. Once this heating process ("estufagem") is completed, the wine is subjected to a [...] rest period ("estágio") of at least 90 days in order to acquire the conditions that will make it possible for the oenologist to finish the wine so that it may be placed in a bottle with the required quality guarantee. These wines may never be bottled and commercialised before the 31st of October of the second year following the harvesting and are typically batch wines. Because of this unique process, Madeira is a very robust wine that can be quite long lived even after being opened.|$|E

[...] "Community Ports" [...] would be for content that is not considered [...] "obscene or harmful" [...] to children; [...] "Open Ports" [...] would be for all other content, including content only considered suitable for adults, such as pornography. According to the advocates of ICPA, this would enable an individual to, through their ISP's firewall, choose the content they want by port, allowing content or blocking out content individually. Advocates of ICPA would particularly like to remove [...] "objectionable" [...] content from Port 80, the <b>standard</b> <b>port</b> for World-Wide Web traffic (but by no means all Internet traffic, making the title somewhat of a misnomer).|$|E
