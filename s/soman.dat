Realizing it's all the pieces of a puzzle, we grasp the stunning answer. Madonna is, in all truth, a modern-day Geisha. She is trapped within her corridor, without the least privacy, but she is free to perform." [...] A reviewer from HitFix commented, [...] " [...] is a gorgeous futuristic creation and one of Madonna's most underrated videos.
