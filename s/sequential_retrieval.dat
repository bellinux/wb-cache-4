In this paper, after the examination of its technical requirements and issues to model complex but practical situation, we propose a new sequential data model, dubbed Duration and Interval Hidden Markov Model (DI-HMM), that efficiently represents "state duration" and "state interval" of data events. This has significant implications to play an important role in representing practical time-series sequential data. This eventually provides an efficient and flexible <b>sequential</b> data <b>retrieval.</b> Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed DI-HMM...|$|R

Isotopic measurements therefore have potential to aid invesigation of dehydration in the polar vortex, of stratospheric/tropospheric exchange, of upward transport in the tropics and of subsidence at polar latitudes. 1. 2 MIPAS The MIPAS spectra contain enough information to distinguish minor isotopes of many gases, including H O and HDO. Microwindows for these isotopes were selected using the Oxford microwindow selection software (1), and the retrievals performed using the MORSE (MIPAS Orbital <b>Retrieval</b> using <b>Sequential</b> Estimation) <b>retrieval</b> code (2), also developed at Oxford.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a recurrent {{neural network model}} with common external and bias inputs that can retrieve branching sequences. Retrieval of memory sequences {{is one of the}} most important functions of the brain. A lot of research has been done on neural networks that process memory sequences. Most of it has focused on fixed memory sequences. However, many animals can remember and recall branching sequences. Therefore, we propose an associative memory model that can retrieve branching sequences. Our model has bias input and common external input. Kawamura and Okada reported that common external input enables <b>sequential</b> memory <b>retrieval</b> in an associative memory model with auto- and weak cross-correlation connections. We show that retrieval processes along branching sequences are controllable with both the bias input and the common external input. To analyze the behaviors of our model, we derived the macroscopic dynamical description as a probability density function. The results obtained by our theory agree with those obtained by computer simulations...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{practice}} on 2 retrievals {{from a single}} cue were investigated. In Experiment 1, participants were given extended single-task practice and were then tested on a dual memory retrieval task. Performance was consistent with a <b>sequential</b> <b>retrieval</b> model proposed by T. C. Rickard and H. Pashler (2003). In Experiment 2, participants practiced both single- and dual-retrieval tasks extensively. Initially, data from all participants indicated <b>sequential</b> <b>retrieval.</b> However, participants who grouped the 2 response outputs were eventually able to perform the dual task with a latency that approached the prediction of a parallel race model. Models that assume a transition from sequential to parallel retrieval with practice, along with other models that assume an immutable retrieval bottleneck at all practice levels, are considered. The question of whether memory retrieval can be executed in parallel with other cognitive processes, including other retrievals, is currently an active topic of investigation. In several recent articles, theorists have advanced the idea that two or more memory instances can be retrieved in parallel (Logan, 1988, 1992; Nosof-sky & Palmeri, 1997; Palmeri, 1997, 1999). Other researchers have explicitly suggested that two retrievals can proceed in parallel from a common cue (Rohrer, Pashler, & Etchegaray, 1998; Ross &...|$|E

Further, new algorithms for workflow similarity computation based on A * search are described. A new retrieval algorithm is introduced that goes beyond traditional <b>sequential</b> <b>retrieval</b> for graphs, interweaving similarity computation with case selection.

40|$|An outline {{is given}} of LIMS {{temperature}} determinations (as {{a function of}} pressure) from measurements in two channels covering portions of the 15 -micrometer band of carbon dioxide. The known sources of error from the radiometer and data reduction are used to estimate the systematic and random errors expected of the results. Observational determinations of the complete end-to-end precision are obtained by computing the standard deviation of six <b>sequential</b> temperature <b>retrievals</b> in regions where the atmosphere is horizontally uniform. This yields values of 0. 2 to 0. 6 K, in reasonable agreement with the estimates. A correction for horizontal gradients in the atmosphere leads to a large reduction in {{the differences between the}} stratospheric temperatures determined on the ascending and descending portions of the orbit. The temperatures agree in the mean with radiosondes and rocketsondes to within 1 - 2 K in most regions below 1 mbar.

40|$|Though not {{especially}} media-rich, mailing lists remain in use and retain popularity for their builtin technological controls and their capability to “reply ” to a message (“continuing a thread”). The motivation for extracting knowledge fragments from the unstructured text of mailing lists is compelling, though successes doing so {{may be considered}} only partial because it requires mental processing, or a certain cognitive effort, that complicates automation. Cognitive psychology distinguishes the Long Term Memory (LTM), which may be compared to text thread storage, from the Working Memory (WM), which initiates the retrieval of knowledge fragments stored in the LTM. Searching by subject, date, and time stamp ranges, and by keyword-inclusive fragments, constitutes the commonly used methods for executing <b>sequential</b> LTM <b>retrieval.</b> Retrieval can, however, be greatly enhanced by automatically gleaning certain classes of threads from the entire structure and displaying them alongside other properties.

40|$|Vertical {{enrichment}} {{profiles of}} stratospheric heavy ozone (asymmetric and symmetric 50 O 3 isotopomers) have been {{derived from the}} Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS). As a continuously operating satellite instrument, MIPAS has an advantage over previous measurements in providing global coverage over an extended time period, allowing the variations in enrichment to be determined. However, since the spectral features of the isotopomers are comparable with {{the magnitude of the}} instrument noise, a <b>sequential</b> estimation <b>retrieval</b> scheme has been used to average the measurements zonally. The magnitude of observed enrichments is ~ 10 % in stratosphere, a value consistent with previous observations and lab measurements. The data indicate that asymmetric heavy ozone is significantly more enriched than the symmetric isotopomer and show latitudinal and vertical variations in both the asymmetric and symmetric 50 O 3 enrichments. Enrichments decrease with decreasing temperature, as previously noted, at midlatidudes and polar regions, while they increase with decreasing temperature in equatorial regions. MIPAS measurements contain also information on the asymmetric and symmetric 49 O 3 isotopomers. The enrichments of 49 O 3 , obtained with the same sequential estimator approach, are much larger than the enrichments of 50 O 3 , in contraddictions with previous results which predict larger enrichments for heavier isotopomers...|$|R

The results of retrieval experiments comparing a sequential search, a cluster-based search, and a search of the clustered collection in which individual documents are scored against the query are also presented. These results indicate that while the absolute performance of a search on a particular collection is dependent on the pairwise similarity of the relevant documents, the relative effectiveness of clustered retrieval versus <b>sequential</b> <b>retrieval</b> is independent of this factor. However, retrieval of entire clusters in response to a query usually results in a poorer performance than retrieval of individual documents from clusters...|$|E

Checksums are placed in the same type of memory locations and addressed {{in the same way as}} normal data. Consequently, the checksums are accessible from the exterior of the main memory just as normal data and this enables implicit fault-tolerance for interconnection and solid-state secondary storage sub-systems. A small hardware mod-ule is used to manage the <b>sequential</b> <b>retrieval</b> of checksums each time the integrity of the data accessed by the processor sub-system needs to be verified. The proposed approach has the following properties: (a) it is cost efficient since it can be used with simple storage and interconnection sub-systems that do not possess any inherent EDAC mechanism, (b) it allows on-line modifications of the memory protection levels, and (c) no modification of the application software is required. ...|$|E
40|$|Fast {{retrieval}} of images from large databases especially from large medical image databases {{is of great}} interest to researchers. We have developed shape-based image retrieval system for spine X-ray images that applies Dynamic Programming (DP) in Partial Shape Matching (PSM) techniques to vertebral boundary data. As we enable Internet access to this system with an aim to enable CBIR access to the entire NHANES II spine X-ray image collection, retrieval efficiency has become critical. In this paper, we present enhancements to our existing <b>sequential</b> <b>retrieval</b> model to provide faster partialshape-based vertebrae retrieval. Based on the characteristics of vertebral osteophyte pathology, anterior superior and anterior inferior parts are the areas with the most interest to the users and are indexed for each shape. Pair-wise distances between indexed parts are pre-calculated and used by agglomerative clustering algorithm to index the whole database. To increase the retrieval speed, PSM with DP is therefore conducted only on a small selected set of shapes by the pre-indexing retrieval. 1...|$|E

We experiment with multi-modal (e. g., image and text) in-teraction and fusion approaches based on relevance feedback information for image retrieval tasks of photographic and medical image collections. For a text-based image search, keywords from the annotated files are extracted and indexed by employing the vector space model of information retrieval. For a content-based image search, various global, semi-global, region-specific and visual concept-based features are extracted {{at different levels of}} image abstraction. Based on relevance feedback information, multi-ple textual and visual query refinements are performed and user’s perceived semantics are propagated from one modality to another with query expansion. The feedback information also dynamically adjusts intra and inter-modality weights in linear com-bination of similarity matching functions. Finally, the top ranked images are obtained by performing both <b>sequential</b> and simultaneous <b>retrieval</b> approaches.

40|$|Bees, wasps and ants-so-called central-place foragers-need potent homing {{strategies}} {{to return to}} their nest. Path integration and view-based landmark guidance are the key strategies for the ants' navigation. For instance, they memorise different views in a sequence (sequential memory) but also have a step counter that informs them about the covered distance during each foraging trip (odometer). The sequential memory and the odometer information can act as contextual cues during travel for retrieving the appropriate stored view. When and which cue is used at different stages and lengths of the foraging trips is still unknown. In this study, we examined how the Australian desert ant Melophorus bagoti uses sequential memory and odometric information to retrieve visual memories. Using a set-up made out of channels and two-choice boxes (Y-mazes), we demonstrate first that M. bagoti foragers are able to learn and discriminate a variety of visual stimuli in a sequence of views along the inbound trip back to the nest. We then forced the homing ants to encounter a fixed sequence of two visual patterns during their inbound trips. By manipulating the position and distance of the visual stimuli and decision boxes, we could set the two contextual cues (sequential memory and odometer) into conflict. After the short 4 -m outbound distance, a preference for odometric information as a contextual cue was found, but after the long 8 -m outbound distance, ants relied primarily on their <b>sequential</b> memory <b>retrieval.</b> Odometer precision deteriorates with increasing travel distance, and accordingly, our findings imply that desert ants may be relying on the most reliable contextual cue for retrieving visual memories. 10 page(s...|$|R

The phi-IASI model implements two physically based inversion algorithms for the <b>sequential</b> <b>retrieval</b> of (a) the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere and (b) the tropospheric content of CO, CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O from hyperspectral radiance observations of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). The retrieval algorithm for trace gases exploits the concept of partially scanned interferogram technique, which is a tool mostly suited for Fourier transform spectrometers in the infrared. Minor and trace gases retrievals for July 2010 are presented and compared to in situ observations from five Mediterranean, permanent, stations of the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) network. The comparison evidences a good general consistency between satellite and in situ observations. IASI retrievals show a marked southeastern gradient, which is shown {{to be consistent with}} the general tropospheric circulation over the Mediterranean basin. These patterns are barely seen from in situ observations, a fact which stresses the importance of satellite (trace gases) data assimilation to improve the performance and quality of trace gases transport models...|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{the use of}} {{workflows}} has significantly expanded from its original domain of business processes towards new areas. The increasing demand for individual and more flexible workflows asks for new methods that support domain experts to create, monitor, and adapt workflows.

New workflows can be constructed by reuse of already available similar workflows from a repository. Hence, methods for the similarity assessment of workflows and for the efficient retrieval of similar workflows from a repository are of core importance.

40|$|Abstract—In many {{advanced}} applications, {{data are}} described by multiple high-dimensional features. Moreover, different queries may weight these features differently; some {{may not even}} specify all the features. In this paper, we propose our solution to support efficient query processing in these applications. We devise a novel representation that compactly captures f features into two components: The first component is a 2 D vector that reflects a distance range (minimum and maximum values) of the f features {{with respect to a}} reference point (the center of the space) in a metric space and the second component is a bit signature, with two bits per dimension, obtained by analyzing each feature’s descending energy histogram. This representation enables two levels of filtering: The first component prunes away points that do not share similar distance ranges, while the bit signature filters away points based on the dimensions of the relevant features. Moreover, the representation facilitates the use of a single index structure to further speed up processing. We employ the classical B þ-tree for this purpose. We also propose a KNN search algorithm that exploits the access orders of critical dimensions of highly selective features and partial distances to prune the search space more effectively. Our extensive experiments on both real-life and synthetic data sets show that the proposed solution offers significant performance advantages over <b>sequential</b> scan and <b>retrieval</b> methods using single and multiple VA-files.

40|$|We {{explored}} whether two memory retrievals from {{a single}} cue can be completed in parallel. Subjects were trained to make a vocal response and a key press response for each {{of a set of}} ten visually presented words. Subsequently, these two tasks were interleaved with a third, dual task condition in which subjects retrieved both the vocal and the key press response on each trial. Findings include: 1) the latency of the first retrieval on dual retrieval trials exceeded that of either of the two tasks performed by themselves, 2) the time to finish the dual retrieval task was roughly the sum of the time to finish the two tasks on separate trials, 3) the correlation between time to finish the first task (RT 1) and the inter-response interval (IRI; latency between the first and the second response) was not significant, and 4) some subjects always choose to execute the slower task first on dual task trials. Taken together, these and other findings favor a <b>sequential</b> <b>retrieval</b> model over a broad class of parallel models.

40|$|Decision-making often {{requires}} retrieval from memory. Drawing on the neural ACT-R theory [Anderson, J. R., Fincham, J. M., Qin, Y., & Stocco, A. A central circuit of the mind. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 12, 136 - 143, 2008] and other neural models of memory, we delineated the neural signatures of two fundamental retrieval aspects during decision-making: automatic and controlled activation of memory representations. To disentangle these processes, we combined a paradigm developed to examine neural correlates of selective and sequential memory retrieval in decision-making with a manipulation of associative fan (i. e., the decision options {{were associated with}} one, two, or three attributes). The results show that both the automatic activation of all attributes associated with a decision option and the controlled <b>sequential</b> <b>retrieval</b> of specific attributes can be traced in material-specific brain areas. Moreover, the two facets of memory retrieval were associated with distinct activation patterns within the frontoparietal network: The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was found to reflect increasing retrieval effort during both automatic and controlled activation of attributes. In contrast, the superior parietal cortex only responded to controlled retrieval, arguably reflecting the sequential updating of attribute information in working memory. This dissociation in activation pattern is consistent with ACT-R and constitutes an important step toward a neural model of the retrieval dynamics involved in memory-based decision-making...|$|E
40|$|Web Information Discovery Integrated Tool (WIDIT) Laboratory at the Indiana University School of Library and Information Science {{participated in}} the Blog track’s opinion task in TREC- 2006. The goal of opinion task is to "uncover the public {{sentiment}} towards a given entity/target", which involves not only retrieving topically relevant blogs but also identifying those that contain opinions about the target. To further complicate the matter, the blog test collection contains considerable amount of noise, such as blogs with non-English content and non-blog content (e. g., advertisement, navigational text), which may misdirect retrieval systems. Based on our hypothesis that noise reduction (e. g., exclusion of non-English blogs, navigational text) will improve both on-topic and opinion retrieval performances, we explored various noise reduction approaches that can effectively eliminate the noise in blog data without inadvertently excluding valid content. After creating two separate indexes (with and without noise) to assess the noise reduction effect, we tackled the opinion blog retrieval task by breaking it down to two <b>sequential</b> subtasks: on-topic <b>retrieval</b> followed by opinion classification. Our opinion retrieval approach was to first apply traditional IR methods to retrieve on-topic blogs, and then boost the ranks of opinionated blogs based on opinion scores generated by opinion assessment methods. Our opinion module consists of Opinion Term Module, which identify opinions based on the frequency of opinion terms (i. e., terms that only occur frequently in opinion blogs), Rare Term Module, which uses uncommon/rare terms (e. g., “sooo good”) for opinion classification, IU Module, which uses IU (I and you) collocations, and Adjective-Verb Module, which uses computational linguistics’ distribution similarity approach to learn the subjective language from training data...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, three image {{features}} are proposed for image retrieval. In addition, a feature selection technique is also brought forward to select optimal features {{to not only}} maximize the detection rate but also simplify the computation of image retrieval. The first and second {{image features}} are based on color and texture features, respectively called color co-occurrence matrix (CCM) and difference between pixels of scan pattern (DBPSP) in this paper. The third image feature is based on color distribution, called color histogram for K-mean (CHKM). CCM is the conventional pattern co-occurrence matrix that calculates the probability of the occurrence of same pixel color between each pixel and its adjacent ones in each image, and this probability is considered as the attribute of the image. According to the sequence of motifs of scan patterns, DBPSP calculates the difference between pixels and converts it into the probability of occurrence on the entire image. Each pixel color in an image is then replaced by one color in the common color palette that is most similar to color so as to classify all pixels in image into k-cluster, called the CHKM feature. Difference in image properties and contents indicates that different features are contained. Some images have stronger color and texture features, while others are more sensitive to color and spatial features. Thus, this study integrates CCM, DBPSP, and CHKM to facilitate image retrieval. To enhance image detection rate and simplify computation of image <b>retrieval,</b> <b>sequential</b> forward selection is adopted for feature selection. Besides, based on the image retrieval system (CTCHIRS), a series of analyses and comparisons are performed in our experiment. Three image databases with different properties are used to carry out feature selection. Optimal features are selected from original features to enhance the detection rate. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{and investigate}} the statistical mechanics of hierarchical neural networks. First, we approach these systems à la Mattis, by {{thinking of the}} Dyson model as a single-pattern hierarchical neural network. We also discuss the stability of different retrievable states as predicted by the related self-consistencies obtained both from a mean-field bound and from a bound that bypasses the mean-field limitation. The latter is worked out by properly reabsorbing the magnetization fluctuations related {{to higher levels of}} the hierarchy into effective fields for the lower levels. Remarkably, mixing Amitʼs ansatz technique for selecting candidate-retrievable states with the interpolation procedure for solving for the free energy of these states, we prove that, due to gauge symmetry, the Dyson model accomplishes both serial and parallel processing. We extend this scenario to multiple stored patterns by implementing the Hebb prescription for learning within the couplings. This results in Hopfield-like networks constrained on a hierarchical topology, for which, by restricting to the low-storage regime where the number of patterns grows at its most logarithmical with the amount of neurons, we prove the existence of the thermodynamic limit for the free energy, and we give an explicit expression of its mean-field bound and of its related improved bound. We studied the resulting self-consistencies for the Mattis magnetizations, which act as order parameters, are studied and the stability of solutions is analyzed to get a picture of the overall retrieval capabilities of the system according to both mean-field and non-mean-field scenarios. Our main finding is that embedding the Hebbian rule on a hierarchical topology allows the network to accomplish both serial and parallel processing. By tuning the level of fast noise affecting it or triggering the decay of the interactions with the distance among neurons, the system may switch from <b>sequential</b> <b>retrieval</b> to multitasking features, and vice versa. However, since these multitasking capabilities are basically due to the vanishing ‘dialogue’ between spins at long distance, this effective penury of links strongly penalizes the networkʼs capacity, with results bounded by low storage...|$|E
