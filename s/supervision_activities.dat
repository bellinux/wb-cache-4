40|$|Labor {{markets in}} all economies {{are subject to}} {{transaction}} costs associated with recruiting, monitoring and supervising workers. The level of transaction costs affects labor and land contract choices and family labor advantages. Rural labor markets in developing economies, where institutions such as labor and contract law and formal employment assistance mechanisms are not in place, are regarded to be particularly sensitive to transaction cost conditions. A number of studies of contract choice support this contention. The inherent difficulty of measuring transaction costs, however, has limited studies on this topic. In this paper, we analyze <b>supervision</b> <b>activities</b> reported in a cross-section survey of rice farmers in the Bicol region of the Philippines. This survey is unique because it provides supervision data at the farm task level in addition to information on production activities and household characteristics over a range of institutional conditions. It also provides barangay (village) level variables that help us to quantify institutional conditions. The data show that family workers either work or supervise, but do not do {{both at the same}} time. This is consistent with a simple optimization model in which supervision intensity increases the productivity of hired workers, which is assumed to be lower than that of family members due to the transaction costs. The model predicts that supervision intensity will increase with transaction costs. We use different institutional conditions to proxy for transaction costs, and estimate the demand for supervision time for four different classes of rice production tasks. The estimation strategy controls for selectivity due to two sources: not all farms use hired labor, and not all farms that use hired labor actually supervise. The results indeed show a positive effect of transaction costs on supervision intensity. We then extend the analysis to a farm efficiency specification to test the proposition that <b>supervision</b> <b>activities</b> improve farm efficiency. This framework allows us to relate institutional conditions to farm efficiency directly and indirectly through their effect on <b>supervision</b> <b>activities.</b> We find that transaction costs have a negative direct effect on farm efficiency, but this is partially offset by increased supervision intensity which enhances efficiency. The results enable us to associate institutional conditions with transaction costs and to draw policy inferences regarding the value of improved institutional conditions.

Résumé Cette étude s'est intéressée aux savoirs mobilisés en classe par les enseignants expérimentés d'Education physique et sportive lors d'un contexte d'intervention particulier, qualifié dans la littérature scientifique de « supervision active ». Les résultats révèlent des régularités au plan de l'organisation spatiale, gestuelle et langagière de l'activité de supervision des enseignants. Ils montrent également des régularités au plan de la signification des actions pour les enseignants. Pour décrire et justifier leurs actions, les enseignants ont recouru à trois niveaux de savoirs. Le premier niveau correspond à l'organisation de leurs actions en référence à des postures de rectitude et de rigidité attendues chez les élèves. Le second niveau renvoie à la connaissance de causalités empiriques par lesquelles ils justifient les corrections qu'ils adressent aux élèves. Le troisième niveau renvoie à des notions théoriques (e. g., mécanique, énergie, perception) que les enseignants explicitent par des images et des métaphores, pour expliquer et justifier les causalités empiriques avancées.

They are describing the characteristic of supervision management structure at SMK Negeri 1 Kaliwungu Semarang; the characteristic of <b>supervision</b> <b>activity</b> at SMK Negeri 1 Kaliwungu Semarang; and the characteristic of supervision reported at SMK Negeri 1 Kaliwungu Semarang. This research is a qualitative research using ethnography design. The informants are the principal, vise principal, and teachers. Data collection method used in-depth interview, observation, and documentation. Analyzing data used interactive model which was started from (1) data reduction, (2) data display, and (3) conclusion. Data validity is triangulation of data source and method of collecting data. Based on the analyzed data, {{there are three}} findings. The first finding is the characteristic of supervision management structure at SMK Negeri 1 Kaliwungu Semarang consists of (1) the supervision management structure involves the principal, the vice principal of curriculum affair, and teacher, (2) each personnel has a task based on their basic tasks, (3) each personnel has a professional working relationship {{in an effort to}} succeed the academic supervision, and (4) the principal and the vice principal of curriculum affair cooperate in preparing the supervision program, schedule, and instrument in a coordination meeting. Secondly, the characteristic of <b>supervision</b> <b>activity</b> at SMK Negeri 1 Kaliwungu Semarang involves the activity carried out by the supervisor and teacher. In the preparation, the supervisor makes a supervision program, schedule, assessment instrument, and socialization of supervision. The preparation which is done by teacher is to prepare the instructional administration instrument. The supervision is done individually toward teacher with a classroom visit technique, classroom observation, and individual meeting. The supervisor conducts observation and assessment of several aspects that consists of (a) the completeness and appropriateness of the instructional administration instrument, (b) acquisition of instructional material, (c) acquisition or classroom management, (d) evaluation of learning, analysis, and follow-up. Thirdly, the characteristic of supervision reported at SMK Negeri 1 Kaliwungu Semarang includes the supervision reported consists of the overall implementation of supervision and feedback obtained from the whole set of supervision. The report is prepared by the supervisor and proposed to the leader, people supervised, and Department of Education and other relevant agencies to be taken as the consideration and further coaching. ...|$|R
40|$|Construction process {{supervision}} is {{as broad}} and complex domain. Legal requirements defining a construction process represent a legal framework for any building project. Building projects {{are exposed to}} different risks. In order to improve managing of projects and relative risks a specific knowledge domain - project management was developed. Main task of the project management is analysis and control of uncertain events, which can affect the construction process and prevent successful accomplishment of project goals. Efficient and effective supervision enables rapid identification of possible deviations from planned construction process caused by different events. It is therefore necessary to define and analyse risk factors that can cause these unpredictable events {{in the early stages}} of construction planning process. The next step is definition of preventive activities, which should be implemented. Different categories of <b>supervision</b> <b>activities</b> follow the construction process and provide its regular validation relative to planning framework. In the thesis, different types of <b>supervision</b> <b>activities</b> were analysed, with specific focus on external supervision process performed by state inspection authorities.

In the thesis, a tool addressing this complexity was analysed, where IDEF 0 process description standard was used. Using the this approach for the modelling of the state inspection of construction process we have obtained an improved insight into this complex activity and identified several process components that currently limit the efficiency and effectiveness of this service...|$|E

This study was a quantitative research with a descriptive correlation method. A proportional random sampling was employed to take the samples and resulted in 129 nurses. The data were collected using questionnaires and analyzed using a univariate analysis and a bivariate analysis with the chi-square test. The results showed that the majority of respondents were women (70. 5 %), aged of 26 - 35 (62. 0 %), hold a Diploma III of nursing (51. 2 %), had attended training (56. 6 %) and were involved as members of the patient safety team (15. 5 %). Furthermore, more than half of the respondents rated the supervision in good category (52, 7 %), and the respondents had good behaviors in implementing the patient safety program (51. 9 %).
