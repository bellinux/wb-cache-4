5|$|A mid- to upper-level trough {{slowed the}} storm {{almost to a}} halt early on August 23, before a drift to the north-northwest began. The next National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{advisory}} then reported that the eye was becoming more distinct and well-defined. This strengthening trend abated because the storm had churned up the waters over which it was passing, bringing cooler water to the <b>surface</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of the}} slow track. Another inhibiting factor may have been related to the same trough that caused the northward turn, though due to a large anticyclone situated over the hurricane, the weakening effects were not substantial. Despite wind shear, the large and powerful circulation resisted weakening for a time. Early on August 25, the shear and the entrainment of drier air into the hurricane took its toll on Bonnie, giving it a ragged appearance on satellite imagery, and the eye briefly became cloud-filled.|$|E
5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the <b>surface</b> <b>as</b> the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the oldest}} rocks in Oregon, {{some of the}} {{formations}} in these terranes date to the Triassic, nearly 250million years ago. Between 165 and 170million years ago, in the Jurassic, faulting consolidated the Klamath terranes offshore during what geologists call the Siskiyou orogeny. This three- to five-million-year episode of intense tectonic activity pushed sedimentary rocks deep enough into the mantle to melt them and then forced them to the <b>surface</b> <b>as</b> granitic plutons. Belts of plutons, which contain gold and other precious metals, run through the Klamaths and include the Ashland pluton, the Grayback batholith east of Oregon Caves National Monument, the Grants Pass pluton, the Gold Hill pluton, the Jacksonville pluton, and others. Miners have worked rich deposits of gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals in several districts of the Klamaths. Placer mining in the mid-19thcentury soon led to lode mining for gold. Aside from a mine in eastern Oregon, the Greenback Mine along Grave Creek, a Rogue tributary, was the most productive gold mine in Oregon.|$|E

5|$|As Klaus was dissipating, a new {{cold low}} {{developed}} over Cuba and developed {{down to the}} <b>surface</b> <b>as</b> a tropical depression on October 9. The depression emerged the Straits of Florida, and quickly intensified into a tropical storm on October 10. After becoming a tropical storm, Marco steadily intensified and eventually peaked with winds of 65mph (100km/h). Marco headed towards Florida, and remained just offshore of the western coast and nearly made landfall near St. Petersburg, Florida on October 12. However, Marco continued to interact with land, and weakened to a tropical depression before actually making landfall near Cedar Key, Florida with winds of 35mph (55km/h). It rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated in Georgia later that day. Although it had dissipated, Marco added to the heavy rainfall already brought to the southeastern states by the remnants Hurricane Klaus.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, {{two years before}} US13 had been {{completed}} as a four-lane divided highway from Dover to Wilmington, Delawareans petitioned DSHD to extend the divided highway south to the Maryland state line at Selbyville or Delmar (US13), a proposition DSHD acknowledged but deferred {{due to lack of}} funding, lack of proper planning, and higher priorities elsewhere in the state. Instead of adding divided highway in southern Delaware, DSHD needed to resolve the problem of the deterioration of 15- to 25-year-old concrete roads, such as those along the DuPont Highway. The department planned to address the issue by patching the concrete <b>surface</b> <b>as</b> needed, adding concrete shoulders, and applying a layer of bituminous concrete, more commonly known as asphalt concrete or blacktop, over the entire width of concrete to provide a wearing surface.|$|E
5|$|By September 23, Jeanne {{had begun}} a slow westward motion, with its {{previously}} well-defined eye becoming ragged. It moved slowly over waters it traversed {{just four days}} prior, causing upwelling; this is the process in which a stationary storm causes the water temperatures to decrease by bringing the cooler, deeper waters to the <b>surface.</b> <b>As</b> a result, Jeanne weakened to a minimal hurricane midday on September 23, though it was forecast to re-intensify and attain major hurricane status. By early on September 24, the winds had decreased to 80mph (130km/h); its convection weakened in intensity, and the eyewall eroded due to dry air entrainment. However, as Jeanne moved toward an area of warmer waters, deep convection redeveloped around the eye. Its favorable upper-level environment allowed the outflow to become better defined, with a large eye and nearby dry air being the primary restraining factors for development. At 1200UTC on September 25, Jeanne attained major hurricane status, and two hours later it made landfall on Abaco Island.|$|E
