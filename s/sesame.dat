5|$|On August 13, 2015, {{as part of}} {{a five-year}} {{programming}} and development deal, <b>Sesame</b> Workshop announced that first-run episodes of <b>Sesame</b> Street would move to premium television service HBO beginning with season 46, which premiered on January 16, 2016. HBO will hold first-run rights to all newer episodes of the series, after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine-month exclusivity window, with no charge to the stations for airing the content. The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream past and future <b>Sesame</b> Street episodes on HBO Go and HBO Now – assuming those rights from Amazon Video and Netflix; on August 14, <b>Sesame</b> Workshop announced that it would phase out its in-house subscription streaming service, <b>Sesame</b> Go, as a standalone service; the service will remain in operation, likely with its offerings reduced to a slate content available for free or serving as a portal for <b>Sesame</b> Streets website. The deal came in the wake of cutbacks that had affected the series in recent years, the changing viewer habits of American children in the previous ten years, and <b>Sesame</b> Workshop's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales.|$|E
5|$|Selig {{created the}} series shortly after leaving <b>Sesame</b> Street, {{which he had}} worked on since it began {{production}} in the late 1960s. He developed the idea for Oobi while watching bare-handed puppeteers audition for Ulica Sezamkowa, the Polish adaptation of <b>Sesame</b> Street. Roles on Oobi were offered to veteran puppeteers from related <b>Sesame</b> Workshop shows. The Jim Henson Company, which designed and built the puppets on <b>Sesame</b> Street, held a stake in Noggin {{at the time of}} Oobis inception. Principal photography took place at Kaufman Astoria Studios, where <b>Sesame</b> Street is also taped.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sesame</b> Street {{international}} co-productions are educational children's {{television series}} {{based on the}} American <b>Sesame</b> Street but tailored to the countries {{in which they are}} produced. Shortly after the debut of <b>Sesame</b> Street in the United States in 1969, television producers, teachers, and officials of several countries approached the show's producers and the executives of <b>Sesame</b> Workshop (2000-present) about the possibility of airing international versions of <b>Sesame</b> Street. Creator Joan Ganz Cooney hired former CBS executive Michael Dann to field offers to produce versions of the show in other countries.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, <b>Sesame</b> Street {{was ranked}} No. 27 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. It also won another Peabody Award in 2009 for sesamestreet.org. In 2013, TV Guide ranked the series No. 30 on {{its list of}} the 60 Best Series. As of 2016, <b>Sesame</b> Street has {{received}} 167 Emmy Awards, {{more than any other}} television series.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Hooper's last {{appearances}} on <b>Sesame</b> Street aired in 1983, but Lee's last segments {{for the show}} were taped in November 1982 and Lee participated in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade with other <b>Sesame</b> Street characters {{a few days before}} he {{died of a heart attack}} on December 7, 1982.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria {{produced}} its {{own version}} of <b>Sesame</b> Street, called <b>Sesame</b> Square, in 2010. Previously, they aired the US version. Funded in part {{by a grant from the}} US government, the show focused on AIDS, malaria nets, gender equality, and yams. It also featured the HIV-positive Muppet Kami from the South African co-production.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 2015, {{as part of}} {{a five-year}} {{programming}} and development deal, <b>Sesame</b> Workshop announced that first-run episodes of <b>Sesame</b> Street would move to premium television service HBO (which had not aired any original children's programming since 2005) in late 2015. <b>Sesame</b> Workshop sought the deal because of declining revenue from viewer donations, and decreases in distribution fees paid by PBS member stations and licensing for merchandise sales (particularly through <b>Sesame</b> Workshop's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales), with the intent to having the show remain on PBS in some fashion (HBO already had involvement in public television {{at the time of the}} deal, providing funding for the talk show Charlie Rose); the deal also came in the wake of changing viewer habits of American children over the previous ten years. HBO will hold first-run rights to all newer episodes of the series starting with season 46, after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine-month exclusivity window, with no charge to the stations for airing the content; however, HBO has not announced whether first-run episodes will air on the pay service's main channel or its multiplex channel HBO Family. The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream past and future <b>Sesame</b> Street episodes on HBO Go and HBO Now – assuming those rights from Amazon Video and Netflix. On August 14, <b>Sesame</b> Workshop announced that it would phase out its in-house subscription streaming service, <b>Sesame</b> Go, as a standalone service; instead of shutting it down entirely, it intends to scale back its offerings to either provide access to a reduced slate of free content or act as a portal for <b>Sesame</b> Streets website.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sesame</b> Street {{has also}} been the {{subjects}} of many controversies throughout its long run on television. In 1970, a commission in Mississippi voted to exclude the show from its state educational TV programming. The controversy surrounding the show stemmed from cultural and historical reasons regarding children and television's effect on them. Latino and feminists groups criticized <b>Sesame</b> Street for its depictions of some groups, but its producers have worked to address their concerns throughout the years. By 2009, <b>Sesame</b> Street had received 118 Emmy Awards, {{more than any other}} television series.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sesame</b> Workshop {{recently}} produced <b>Sesame</b> Amigos for Spanish-speakers {{from the}} United States. This series aired Saturday mornings on Univision {{as part of}} their Planeta U block until October 2017 when it was replaced by Calimero.|$|E
5|$|After <b>Sesame</b> Streets first season, {{its critics}} forced its {{producers}} and researchers to address more overtly such affective goals as social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict. These issues were addressed through interpersonal disputes among its Street characters. During the 1980s, the show incorporated the real-life {{experiences of the}} show's cast and crew, including the death of Will Lee (Mr. Hooper) and the pregnancy of Sonia Manzano (Maria) to address affective concerns. In later seasons, <b>Sesame</b> Street addressed real-life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|After <b>Sesame</b> Streets initial success, the CTW {{began to}} think about its {{survival}} beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and programs for preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the <b>Sesame</b> Street Muppets accounted for $15–17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Cooney resigned as CEO during 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement. On June 5, 2000, the CTW changed its name to <b>Sesame</b> Workshop to better represent its work which included non-television activities, and Gary Knell became CEO. H. Melvin Ming replaced Knell during 2011. During 2014, Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D. Dunn.|$|E

5|$|By <b>Sesame</b> Streets 40th anniversary, it {{was ranked}} the fifteenth most popular children's show on television. When the show premiered in 1969, 130 episodes a year were produced; in 2009, because of rising costs, twenty-six episodes were made. In 2000, the Children's Television Workshop, which had {{changed its name}} to the <b>Sesame</b> Workshop (SW) in June 2000 to better reflect its entry into non-television and {{interactive}} media, launched a website with a library of free video clips and free podcasts from throughout the show's history. The 2008–2009 recession, which led to budget cuts for many nonprofit arts organizations, severely affected <b>Sesame</b> Street; in spring 2009, the SW had to lay off 20% of its staff.|$|E

5|$|In 1995 a {{longitudinal}} study was conducted at the University of Kansas, the first large-scale evaluation of <b>Sesame</b> Street's cognitive effects in over twenty years. Its findings supported those of previous studies: early viewing of educational children's television appeared to contribute to children's school readiness. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds learned as much as advantaged children per hour of viewing, {{but they did not}} watch enough to gain the program's maximum benefit. In comparing the effects of watching <b>Sesame</b> Street with other programs, commercial entertainment and cartoons had a negative effect; watching <b>Sesame</b> Street daily did not increase children's viewing of other categories of television, nor make them less likely to participate in other educational activities.|$|E

5|$|<b>Sesame</b> Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown <b>Sesame</b> Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the <b>Sesame</b> Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at <b>Sesame</b> Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E

5|$|The {{back cover}} on early prints of the CD {{featured}} a plush toy of Ernie from <b>Sesame</b> Street, which was airbrushed out of later prints {{for fear of}} litigation; however, Canadian and European prints still feature Ernie on the back cover. Some rumors suggest that it was removed because it led parents to think that Dookie was a child's lullaby album or that the creators of <b>Sesame</b> Street had sued Green Day.|$|E

5|$|The {{show has}} {{undergone}} significant changes throughout its history. The format of <b>Sesame</b> Street {{consists of a}} combination of commercial television production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect the changes in American culture and the audience's viewing habits. With the creation of <b>Sesame</b> Street, producers and writers of a children's television show used, for the first time, educational goals and a curriculum to shape its content. It was also the first time a show's educational effects were formally studied.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} after the 1969 debut of <b>Sesame</b> Street on PBS in the US, {{producers}} from Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Iran and Germany requested that the organization responsible for the show's production, the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), create and produce versions of <b>Sesame</b> Street in those countries. Even before the American show's debut, the CTW established an international division, which oversaw its licensing in other countries. According to Gregory J. Gettas, the division immediately developed four main licensing policies: (1) Like the American version, all foreign versions had to be broadcast without commercials; (2) any changes would have to meet high production standards, which protected the CTW's proprietary interests; (3) all versions had to reflect the country's cultural values and traditions; and (4) all changes would have to be approved, initiated, and supervised by a local committee working with the CTW.|$|E
5|$|As critic Richard Roeper has stated, {{perhaps one}} of the strongest {{indicators}} of the influence of <b>Sesame</b> Street has been the enduring rumors and urban legends surrounding the show and its characters, especially those concerning Bert and Ernie.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently {{with the}} first years of <b>Sesame</b> Street, Henson {{directed}} Tales from Muppetland, a short series of TV movie specials: comic retellings of classic fairy tales, aimed at a young audience and hosted by Kermit the Frog. The series included Hey, Cinderella!, The Frog Prince, and The Muppet Musicians of Bremen.|$|E
5|$|Cooney {{remained}} {{executive director}} of the CTW until 1990, when she became the chair of CTW's executive board. She served on several boards, was the trustees of many organizations, and received many awards and honorary degrees. In 2007, the <b>Sesame</b> Workshop founded The Joan Ganz Cooney Center, named in her honor.|$|E

5|$|Iftah Ya Simsim was {{the first}} children's {{educational}} TV program {{of its kind in}} the Arab world and the first <b>Sesame</b> Street co-production in the region. It {{was the first}} co-production to use Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Its development was similar to that of the American version of <b>Sesame</b> Street in the late 1960s. The GCC considered creating a co-production for many years, so consultations were held among its member countries regarding how to do so. Many of the early co-productions were simple, dubbed versions with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways, but the GCC wanted to create their own original version.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{television}} producer Joan Ganz Cooney {{and her staff}} at the Children's Television Workshop, impressed by the quality and creativity of the Henson-led team, asked Henson and staff to work full-time on <b>Sesame</b> Street, a visionary children's program for public television. This union of talents would become legendary in television entertainment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1970, partly as a {{response}} to criticism that they were not reaching their intended audience, the CTW conducted a poll of four urban neighborhoods in New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The results of the poll were positive in three out of the four neighborhoods and confirmed the show's high viewership. <b>Sesame</b> Street's high ratings increased during its second season, and Nielsen reported high audience loyalty. Gerald S. Lesser, CTW's first advisory board chair, reported rumors about the show becoming a fad among college students. Its ratings steadily increased for the first five seasons, and Nielsen reported that <b>Sesame</b> Street had the highest ratings of any PBS program. In 1985, the Workshop estimated that 20% of its regular viewers consisted of adults.|$|E
