[...] At the time, TV Fanatic called [...] "Northwest Passage" [...] the best Fringe episode to date, giving the series' its first [...] "five out of five stars".|$|E

Daymon recalled [...] "There have been times, especially after Someday Shambles, when our popularity in Australia had really <b>surprised</b> <b>us</b> {{and we were}} playing to huge crowds at the Big Day Out and we'd had two really successful records. We were a little dismayed as to why we couldn't push it further into the overseas area. Unfortunately {{it seemed to be}} the politics of working with a record on a major label that held us back. It's not much of an incentive for a label overseas to make you a priority if a lot of the profit is going back to the company where the band is from". In August, the group issued a six-track split EP with Jimmy Eat World, Jebediah / Jimmy Eat World in the US through independent label, Big Wheel Recreation.|$|E

He <b>surprised</b> <b>us</b> all by speaking exceedingly good English, and possessing an intimate knowledge {{of the ways and}} manners of civilized life ... There was no topic of general interest on which he did not possess a fair amount of knowledge. He wore his hair in the fashion of the country, i.e., in a mop frizzled out to an immense size, and in other respects he was got up as a native chief of distinction. He spoke favourably of British rule, although, as we were otherwise informed, he himself had recently acquired a practical experience of the unpleasant consequences attending the commission of an indictable offence, in having to undergo a sentence of three months' hard labour." [...] This book talks about Celua spending three years at University after returning to Sydney with his father in 1874 but no other reference to his tertiary education can be found.|$|E
