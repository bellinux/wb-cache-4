40|$|Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) {{models are}} rarely {{verified}} for mountainous regions {{during the winter}} season, although avalanche forecasters and other decision makers frequently rely on NWP models. Winter precipitation from two NWP models (GEM-LAM and GEM 15) and from a precipitation analysis system (CaPA) was verified at approximately 100 stations {{in the mountains of}} western Canada and the north-western US. Ultrasonic snow depth sensors and <b>snow</b> <b>pillows</b> were used to observe daily precipitation amounts. For the first time, a detailed objective validation scheme was performed highlighting many aspects of forecast quality. Overall, the models underestimated precipitation amounts, although low precipitation categories were overestimated. The finer resolution model GEM-LAM performed best in all analysed aspects of model performance, while the precipitation analysis system performed worst. An analysis of the economic value of large precipitation categories showed that only mitigation measures with low cost–loss ratios (i. e. measures that can be performed often) will benefit from these NWP models. This means that measures with large associated costs relative to anticipated losses when the measure is not performed should not or not primarily depend on forecasted precipitation...|$|R
40|$|Manual snow {{measurements}} {{are becoming increasingly}} expensive {{at the same time}} as climate change imposed snow alterations affect runoff and frost patterns; snow observations are included in runoff modelling, making reliable snow observations outmost important. Multiple new and modified ground-based techniques for monitoring snow depth, density, water equivalent (SWE), wetness, and layering have been tested over the last decade justifying a review of such methods. Techniques based on snow mass, electrical properties, attenuation of radioactivity and, other miscellaneous properties are reviewed. The following sensors seem suitable for registration of temporal variations: Ultrasonic (depth) and terrestrial laser scanning (depth), several <b>snow</b> <b>pillows</b> at the same location (SWE), CRREL/NRCS weighing sensor (SWE), Snowpower (depth, density, SWE and wetness), active and passive (cosmic) gamma-ray attenuation (SWE), and adjusted TDR-probes (density and wetness). Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is, depending on design and operation mode, suitable for different purposes; when arrays of antennas are pulled by a snowmobile the technique is suitable for monitoring of spatial variations in depth, density and SWE for dry snow.

40|$|Water supply {{forecasts}} in the Sierra Nevada using ground-based {{measurements of}} snow water equivalent (SWE) are uncertain because neither point measurements nor transects adequately explain spatial or temporal vari- ability in mountainous terrain. To address this problem, we combine satellite-based retrievals of fractional snow cover in 2006 with energy balance calculations {{to reconstruct the}} SWE values throughout the melt season. Model estimates when compared to <b>snow</b> <b>pillows</b> at maximum accumulation are unbiased and have an RMS error of 297 to 417 mm. We compare this retrospective calculation of distributed SWE with two real-time models: (i) interpola- tion from pillows, courses, and satellite snow cover, and (ii) the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS). The interpolation and SNODAS models show complete melt out {{more than a month}} earlier than reconstruction, and their total SWE volumes are 68 % and 87 % of the reconstructed volume. At elevations below 1500 m, the recon- struction model has less total SWE because of early season melt. Above 3000 m, the reconstruction shows more SWE than the real time models, which depend on surface measurements that do not sample the higher elevations. The results indicate that spatial patterns from the reconstruction could improve estimates of snow accumulation and duration. Funded by Naval Postgraduate School.

40|$|The California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program {{began in}} 1929 and has {{continued}} since {{as a very}} important water management and regulation tool in the State. Each spring, about 50 agencies pool their efforts in collecting snow data at nearly 270 snow courses in the mountains. The snowpack information, along with precipitation and antecedent river runoff data, are used by Department of Water Resources staff experts to develop forecasts of expected snowmelt runoff and total annual water runoff on the major rivers. These forecasts are used by water agencies, farmers, cities, hydroelectric facility operators, and regulators to manage the available water supply {{for the benefit of}} the State’s farm, urban, and environmental interests. Runoff forecasts are made systematically, based on historical regression relationships between the volume of April through July runoff, and the snow water content, precipitation and runoff in preceding months. The official monthly forecasts depend quite heavily on manual snow course data, whereas periodic updates after major storms rely on daily or even hourly information from about 115 remote <b>snow</b> sensors (<b>snow</b> <b>pillows)</b> which report in by satellite radio. Although most people are just interested in the median future outlook, a range of forecasts from 90 percent sure to 10 percent sure is also provided on most rivers.

40|$|The {{temporal}} evolution of snowpacks {{is important for}} avalanche forecasts and flood predictions. Especially in complex alpine terrain, such as avalanche starting zones, it is until now difficult to derive continuous and non-destructive information on snow parameters. In our previous work, we already demonstrated the feasibility to quantitatively derive snowpack properties and monitor their evolution in time using an upward-looking ground penetrating radar (upGPR) that was buried underneath the snow. To determine some properties, we still needed additional information such as independently measured snow height. To overcome these limitations, we present two promising methods: (1) We combined the upGPR travel-time information with tomographic GPS signal strength losses. This combination allowed determining liquid water content, snow height and snow water equivalent from beneath the snow cover without using external information. The snow parameters derived by combining upGPR and GPS data are in good agreement with conventional sensors as e. g. laser distance gauges or <b>snow</b> <b>pillows.</b> As the GPS sensors are cheap, they can easily be installed in parallel with upGPR systems. (2) To fully exploit the information content of upGPR data, and thus to at least partially compensate {{for the lack of}} information, we applied full-waveform inversion (FWI) techniques. We refined the model of the snowpack by repeated forward modeling the waveforms and updating the model parameters to match it with recorded data. This allowed us to determine the density and the liquid water content for each layer in the snowpack. Both approaches show a high potential for alpine management tasks...|$|R
40|$|Precipitation {{measurements}} by rain gauges {{are usually}} {{affected by a}} systematic underestimation, which can be larger in case of snowfall. The wind, disturbing the trajectory of the falling water droplets or snowflakes above the rain gauge, is {{the major source of}} error, but when tipping-bucket recording gauges are used, the induced evaporation due to the heating device must also be taken into account. Manual measurements of fresh snow water equivalent (SWE) were taken in Alpine areas of Valtellina and Vallecamonica, in Northern Italy, and compared with daily precipitation and melted snow measured by manual precipitation gauges and by mechanical and electronic heated tipping-bucket recording gauges without any wind-shield: all of these gauges underestimated the SWE in a range between 15 % and 66 %. In some experimental monitoring sites, instead, electronic weighing storage gauges with Alter-type wind-shields are coupled with <b>snow</b> <b>pillows</b> data: daily SWE measurements from these instruments are in good agreement. In order to correct the historical data series of precipitation affected by systematic errors in snowfall measurements, a simple ‘at-site’ and instrument-dependent model was first developed that applies a correction factor as a function of daily air temperature, which is an index of the solid/liquid precipitation type. The threshold air temperatures were estimated through a statistical analysis of snow field observations. The correction model applied to daily observations led to 5 – 37 % total annual precipitation increments, growing with altitude (1740 ÷ 2190 m above sea level, a. s. l.) and wind exposure. A second ‘climatological‘ correction model based on daily air temperature and wind speed was proposed, leading to errors only slightly higher than those obtained for the at-site corrections...|$|R
40|$|This poster {{continues}} {{the evaluation of}} the CS 725 snow water equivalent (SWE) sensor as previously conducted by Wright et al. (2011). The CS 725 was developed by Hydro Quebec in collaboration with Campbell Scientific Canada Corporation and determines SWE by passively measuring the attenuation of naturally emitted terrestrial gamma radiation from the soil by the snowpack. The CS 725 provides a non-contact technique for determining SWE that is effective with any type of snow or ice cove and whose performance is not affected by adverse weather conditions. Field testing of the CS 725 was conducted at Sunshine Village, Alberta (2008 - 2011), SNOTEL Tony Grove Ranger Station, Utah (2009 - 2010), and Anestølen, Norway (2011 - 2012). The CS 725 values were compared to other sensors, which produce SWE either directly or indirectly: <b>snow</b> <b>pillow,</b> precipitation gauge, snow depth sensor, and manual SWE values from snow course measurements. Strong agreement is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively between all automated methods of SWE: CS 725, <b>snow</b> <b>pillow,</b> and precipitation gauge. Statistically, all automated methods show strong correlations of 0. 96 - 0. 99 over the entire season and up to peak periods.

40|$|ABSTRACT Management of snow, as a water {{resource}} within the arid/semi-arid southwest, requires timely and accurate predictions of snow melt. Using energy balance, regression. and temperature melt factor models predictions were generated from in-situ hydro meteorological observations. Comparisons were made between model and USDA Soil Conservation Service Snow Telemetry [SNOTEL] <b>snow</b> <b>pillow.</b> Observed days of mel ~ {{as reported by}} the <b>snow</b> <b>pillow,</b> appear to summarize all previous days ' worth of melt that were below the snow pillows ' sensitivity. Coupling direct observations and model predictions appear necessary for timely and accurate predictions of snow melt. Snow melt is the single most improvable and manageable {{water resource}} available for the unrelenting needs of the arid/semi-arid southwest. Numerous regional studies [Jones and Brazel, 1986; Ffollion and Rasmussen. 1976], predictive technique studies [Ffolliott. 1985; Jones et al, 1976], and simulation models [Rasmussen and Ffolliot ~ 1981; Solomon et al, 1976] have been completed. All have indicated differing results due to variables observed. period and frequency of observation. instrument sensitivity, spatial variability, and model type. The focus of this paper and research is to determine the 'best ' model type to predict snow melt.

40|$|The {{temporal}} evolution of Alpine snowpacks {{is important for}} assessing water supply, hydropower generation, flood predictions and avalanche forecasts. Especially in high mountain regions with an extremely varying topography, it is until now often difficult to derive continuous and non-destructive information on snow parameters. Since autumn 2012, we are running a new low-cost GPS (Global Positioning System) snow measurement experiment at the high alpine study site Weissfluhjoch (2450 m a. s. l.) in Switzerland. The globally and freely broadcasted GPS L 1 -band (1. 57542 GHz) was continuously recorded with GPS antennas, which are installed at the ground surface underneath the snowpack. GPS raw data, containing carrier-to-noise power density ratio (C/N 0) as well as elevation and azimuth angle information for each time step of 1 s, was stored and analyzed for all 32 GPS satellites. Since the dielectric permittivity of an overlying wet snowpack influences microwave radiation, the bulk volumetric liquid water content as well as daily melt-freeze cycles can be derived non-destructively from GPS signal strength losses and external snow height information. This liquid water content information is qualitatively in good accordance with meteorological and snow-hydrological data and quantitatively highly agrees with continuous data derived from an upward-looking ground-penetrating radar (upGPR) working in a similar frequency range. As a promising novelty, we combined the GPS signal strength data with upGPR travel-time information of active impulse radar rays to the snow surface and back from underneath the snow cover. This combination allows determining liquid water content, snow height and snow water equivalent from beneath the snow cover without using any other external information. The snow parameters derived by combining upGPR and GPS data are in good agreement with conventional sensors as e. g. laser distance gauges or <b>snow</b> <b>pillows.</b> As the GPS sensors are cheap, they can easily be installed in parallel with further upGPR systems or as sensor networks to monitor the snowpack evolution in avalanche paths or at a larger scale in an entire hydrological basin to derive distributed melt-water runoff information...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSnow in the High Atlas Mountains is a {{major source}} for {{freshwater}} renewal and for water availability in the semi-arid lowlands of south-eastern Morocco. Snowfall- and snow-ablation monitoring and modelling is important for estimating potential water delivery from the mountain water towers to the forelands. This study is part of GLOWA-IMPETUS, an integrated management project dealing with scarce water resources in West Africa. The Ameskar study area is located {{to the south of}} the High Atlas Mountains, in their rain shadow. As a part of the M'Goun river basin within the upper Drâa valley, the study area is characterised by high radiation inputs, low atmospheric humidity and long periods with sub-zero temperatures. Its altitude ranges between 2000 m and 4000 m, with dominant north- and south-facing slopes. Snowfall occurs mainly from November to April but even summit regions can become repeatedly devoid of snow cover. Snow cover maps for the M'Goun basin (1240 km 2) are derived from calculations of NDSI (Normalized Difference Snow Index) from MODIS satellite images and snow depth is monitored at four automatic weather stations between 2000 ? 4000 m. Snowfall events are infrequent at lower altitudes. The presence of snow penitentes at altitudes above 3000 m indicates that snow sublimation is an important component of snow ablation. Snow ablation was modelled with the UEB Utah Energy Balance Model (Tarboton and Luce, 1996). This single layer, physically-based, point energy and mass balance model is driven by meteorological variables recorded at the automatic weather stations at Tounza (2960 m) and Tichki (3260 m). Data from <b>snow</b> <b>pillows</b> at Tounza and Tichki are used to validate the model's physical performance in terms of energy and water balances for a sequence of two snowfall events in the winter of 2003 / 4. First UEB modelling results show good overall performance and timing of snowmelt and sublimation compared to field investigations. Up to 44 % of snow ablation is attributed to snow sublimation in typical winters with subzero temperatures and low atmospheric humidity at an altitude of 3000 m. At altitudes below 3000 m snowmelt generally dominates over sublimation. Unfortunately, the highest altitude zones suffer long periods with direct water loss into the atmosphere by sublimation in the course of which they cannot contribute to direct runoff or groundwater formation in the southern High Atlas Mountains.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} one of the most serious {{environmental}} threats that humanity has ever been confronted to. Hydrological models are vital tools to asses its impacts on the water cycle and water resources. The goal of this project is to evaluate and improve the capacity of the HBV model (Hydrologiska Byr°ans Vattenbalansavdelning) in simulating hydrological processes in mountainous and glacierised regions under both the present and future climate. This goal is achieved in two steps: (1) implement routing and glacier retreating modules in a grid-based HBV model for mountainous and glacierised areas in Norway and the Himalayan region (i. e. Bhutan and India); (2) calculate available water resource scenarios for two Himalayan basins with considerable glacier coverage and growing water demand. The thesis is composed of four peer-reviewed articles which focus on the two steps. Articles I and II examine model setting effects on their performance in reproducing major hydrological processes. Articles I implemented routing algorithms in the grid-based HBV model and tested them at various spatial resolutions in the Glomma basin (Norway). The routing procedures improved the model performance in daily runoff simulation to varying extents. A hillslope routing method and its combination with the channel routing returned a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient 0. 05 higher than the initial grid-based model. Articles II evaluated five variants of the HBV model in runoff simulation of interior points and internal variables in the Norsfoss basin (Norway). The five variants were a lumped (LWhole), a semi-distributed (SBand) and three grid-based models, GRZero (without routing), GROne (hillslope routing) and GRTwo (hillslope and channel routing). For runoff simulations, GRTwo and GROne were superior over other model variants in model efficiency, particularly in simulating low flow. This superiority deteriorated in reproducing runoff at six interior points. Compared with measurements of snow water equivalent at <b>snow</b> <b>pillows</b> and groundwater depth in piezometers, all grid-based models had a similar efficiency. Articles IIII and IV include an integration of a mass conserving glacier model into the HBV model and its application in water resource projections. Article III combined the glacier retreat model with the HBV model. The coupled model was tested in three basins (the Nigardsbreen basin in Norway, the Chamkhar Chhu basin in Bhutan and the Beas basin in India) with different glacier coverage and hydrologic regime. Results showed that, in addition to runoff simulation, the model gave a high efficiency in reproducing glacier annual mass balance in the Nigardsbreen basin where measurements are available to verify the results. Moreover, the model provided maps of snow distribution and glacier runoff. Article IV projected available water resources per capita (Wp) for the Chamkhar Chhu (eastern Himalaya) and the Beas (western Himalaya) basins for the period 2010 – 2050. All climate projections indicated significant increases in annual temperature, but not in annual precipitation. All Wp projections revealed pronounced water resources drops jointly induced by continuous climate change and population growth. The latter is responsible for roughly 40 % of the water declines. The regional climate models and CO 2 emissions cause approximately 30 % unceratainties ranging from 11 % to 44 %. When considering ± 20 % inaccuracy in population estimations, the highest uncertainty reaches 87 %. The uncertainties are worthy of attention, but there is no doubt that the two basins are facing serious water scarcity and the water conditions will get worse. Water shortage has been and continues to be a major constraint of economic and social development...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a newly proposed data assimilation method for historical snow water equivalent SWE estimation using remotely sensed fractional snow-covered area fSCA. The newly proposed approach {{consists of a}} particle batch smoother (PBS), which is compared to a previously applied Kalman-based ensemble batch smoother (EnBS) approach. The methods were applied over the 27 -yr Landsat 5 record at <b>snow</b> <b>pillow</b> and snow course in situ verification sites in the American River basin in the Sierra Nevada (United States). This basin is more densely vegetated and thus more challenging for SWE estimation than the previous applications of the EnBS. Both data assimilation methods provided significant improvement over the prior (modeling only) estimates, with both able to significantly reduce prior SWE biases. The prior RMSE values at the <b>snow</b> <b>pillow</b> and snow course sites were reduced by 68 %- 82 % and 60 %- 68 %, respectively, when applying the data assimilation methods. This result is encouraging for a basin like the American where the moderate to high forest cover will necessarily obscure more of the snow-covered ground surface than in previously examined, less-vegetated basins. The PBS generally outperformed the EnBS: for snow pillows the PBSRMSE was approx. 54 %of that seen in the EnBS, while for snow courses the PBSRMSE was approx. 79 %of the EnBS. Sensitivity tests show relative insensitivity for both the PBS and EnBS results to ensemble size and fSCA measurement error, but a higher sensitivity for the EnBS to the mean prior precipitation input, {{especially in the case}} where significant prior biases exist...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSnow, whilst not a {{dominant}} feature of Britain's maritime climate, can exert a {{significant influence on}} major floods through its contribution as snowmelt. Flood warning systems which fail {{to take account of}} melting snow can prove highly misleading. Selected results of a study on methods for improved snowmelt forecasting using trail catchments in upland Britain are presented here. Melt models considered range from a temperature excess formulation, with the option to include wind and rain heating effects, to a full energy budget melt formulation. Storage of melt in the pack is controlled by a store with two outlets, allowing slow release of water followed by rapid release once a critical liquid water content is reached. For shallow snow packs, a partial cover curve determines the proportion of the catchment over which snow extends. The melt, storage and release mechanisms together constitute the PACK snowmelt module which provides inputs to the catchment model. Either a lumped or distributed catchment model can be used, configured to receive snowmelt inputs from elevation zones within the catchment; a PACK snowmelt module operates independently within each zone and its inputs are controlled by appropriate elevation lapse rates. Measurements of snow depth and/or water equivalent, from snow cores or a <b>snow</b> <b>pillow,</b> are assimilated to correct for a lack of direct snowfall measurements needed to maintain a water balance during snowfall. The updating scheme involves operating a PACK module at the measurement site (the "point model") in parallel to PACK modules in the catchment model, with point model errors being transferred using a proportioning scheme to adjust the snowpack water contents of the catchment model. The results of the assessment of different model variants broadly favour the simpler model formulations. Hourly automatic monitoring of water equivalent using the <b>snow</b> <b>pillow</b> can help in updating the model but preferential melting from the pillow can be a problem. The energy budget melt formulation proves useful in understanding the energy components of melt typical of upland Britain. It reveals that, during the main melt phase, melt can occur in almost equal measure by sensible heat exchange and by latent heat of condensation, as warm air near saturation in cloud condenses on the snowpack; net radiation makes a negligible contribution. This provides a physical explanation for the success of the simple temperature excess approach to snowmelt estimation...|$|E

40|$|ABSRACT: Accurate spatial {{measurement}} of SWE in mountain watersheds {{is perhaps the}} most significant problem in snow hydrology. Because of the spatial variability of snow in these areas, operational models can have large errors, particularly in remote regions. We describe how operational needs led us to merge different approaches. Recently, SWE reconstruction has been shown to match well the rank order of snowmelt runoff across the Sierra Nevada, CA USA, especially for very dry and wet years. Ending with a date for peak SWE and starting with the disappearance of snow in a satellite image, reconstruction retrospectively builds the snow cover by calculating the amount of snow melted at each time step in each pixel. Operational experience has demonstrated the need for subjective context and perspective. We place the current water year into a historical perspective graphically by displaying a family of accumulation-depletion curves. Because reconstruction cannot estimate SWE prior to peak, we use an ensemble of normalized products for accumulation. The products in the ensemble depend on whether the study area is sparsely or heavily gauged. For instance, in the Sierra Nevada, a heavily gauged area, we use <b>snow</b> <b>pillow</b> interpolation and the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) for SWE accumulation. In Afghanistan, a sparsely gauged area, we use satellite-derived SWE from passive microwave emission for accumulation. From the normalized accumulatio...|$|E
40|$|Short-term {{climate and}} weather systems {{can have a}} strong {{influence}} on mountain snowmelt, sometimes overwhelming the effects of elevation and aspect. Although most years exhibit a spring onset that starts first at lowest and moves to highest elevations, in spring 2002, flow {{in a variety of}} streams within the Tuolumne and Merced River basins of the southern Sierra Nevada all rose synchronously on 29 March. Flow in streams draining small high-altitude glacial subcatchments rose {{at the same time as}} that draining much larger basins gauged at lower altitudes, and streams from north- and south-facing cirques rose and fell together. Historical analysis demonstrates that 2002 was one among only 8 yr with such synchronous flow onsets during the past 87 yr, recognized by having simultaneous onsets of snowmelt at over 70 % of <b>snow</b> <b>pillow</b> sites, having discharge in over 70 % of monitored streams increase simultaneously, and having temperatures increase over 128 C within a 5 -day period. Synchronous springs tend to begin with a low pressure trough over California during late winter, followed by the onset of a strong ridge and unusually warm temperatures. Synchronous springs are characterized by warmer than average winters and cooler than average March temperatures in California. In the most elevation-dependent, nonsynchronous years, periods of little or no storm activity, with warmer than average March temperatures, precede the onset of spring snowmelt, allowing elevation and aspect to influence snowmelt as spring arrives gradually. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn January/February 2006, heavy snowfalls in Bavaria (Germany) lead to {{a series}} of infrastructural damage of catastrophic nature. Since on many {{collapsed}} roofs the total snow load was not exceptional, serious engineering deficiencies in roof construction and a sudden rise in the total snow load were considered to be the trigger of the events. An analysis of the then meteorological conditions reveals, that the early winter of 2005 / 2006 was characterised by an exceptional continuous snow cover, temperatures remained around the freezing point and no significant snowmelt was evident. The frequent freezing/thawing cycles were followed by a general compaction of the snow load. This resulted in a re-distribution and a new concentration of the snow load on specific locations on roofs. With respect to climate change, the question arises as to whether the risks relating to snow loads will increase. The future probability of a continuous snow cover occurrence with frequent freezing/thawing cycles will probably decline due to predicted higher temperatures. However, where temperatures remain low, an increase in winter precipitation will result in increased snow loads. Furthermore, the variability of extremes is predicted to increase. If heavy snowfall events are more frequent, the risk of a trigger event will likely increase. Finally, an attempt will be made here in this paper to outline a concept for an operational warning system for the Bavarian region. This system envisages to predict the development and risk of critical snow loads for a 3 -day time period, utilising a combination of climate and snow modelling data and using this together with a <b>snow</b> <b>pillow</b> device (located on roofs) and the results of which...|$|E
40|$|Measuring {{precipitation}} {{in mountain}} areas is a demanding task, but essential for hydrological and environmental themes. Especially in small Alpine catchments with short hydrological response, precipitation data with high temporal resolution {{are required for}} {{a better understanding of}} the hydrological cycle. Since most climate/meteorological stations are situated at the easily accessible bottom of valleys, and the few heated rain gauges installed at higher elevation sites are problematic in winter conditions, an accurate quantification of winter (snow) precipitation at high elevations remains difficult. However, there are an increasing number of micro-meteorological stations and snow height sensors at high elevation locations in Alpine catchments. To benefit from data of such stations, an improved approach to estimate solid and liquid precipitation (ESOLIP) is proposed. ESOLIP allows gathering hourly precipitation data throughout the year by using unheated rain gauge data, careful filtering of snow height sensors as well as standard meteorological data (air temperature, relative humidity, global shortwave radiation, wind speed). ESOLIP was validated at a well-equipped test site in Stubai Valley (Tyrol, Austria), comparing results to winter precipitation measured with a <b>snow</b> <b>pillow</b> and a heated rain gauge. The snow height filtering routine and indicators for possible precipitation were tested at a field site in Matsch Valley (South Tyrol, Italy). Results show a good match with measured data because variable snow density is taken into account, which is important when working with freshly fallen snow. Furthermore, the results show the need for accurate filtering of the noise of the snow height signal and they confirm the unreliability of heated rain gauges for estimating winter precipitation. The described improved precipitation estimate ESOLIP at sub-daily time resolution is helpful for precipitation analysis and for several hydrological applications like monitoring systems and rainfall-runoff models...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} and modeling of the snowpack energy balance {{are critical to}} understanding the terrestrial water cycle. Most of the water resources in the western US come from snowmelt, yet statistical runoff models that rely on the historical record are becoming less reliable because of a changing climate. For physically based snow melt models that do not depend on past conditions, ground based measurements of the energy balance components are imperative for verification. For this purpose, the US Army Corps of Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) established the CUES snow study site (CRREL/UCSB Energy Site, [URL] at 2940 m elevation on Mammoth Mountain, California. We describe CUES, {{provide an overview of}} research, share our experience with scientific measurements, and encourage future collaborative research. Snow measurements began near the current CUES site for ski area operations in 1969. In the 1970 s, researchers began taking scientific measurements. Today, CUES benefits from year round gondola access and a fiber optic internet connection. Data loggers and computers automatically record and store over 100 measurements from more than 50 instruments each minute. CUES is one of only five high altitude mountain sites in the Western US where a full suite of energy balance components are measured. In addition to measuring snow on the ground at multiple locations, extensive radiometric and meteorological measurements are recorded. Some of the more novel measurements include scans by an automated terrestrial LiDAR, passive and active microwave imaging of snow stratigraphy, microscopic imaging of snow grains, snowflake imaging with a multi-angle camera, fluxes from upward and downward looking radiometers, snow water equivalent from different types of snow pillows, snowmelt from lysimeters, and concentration of impurities in the snowpack. We give an example of terrain-corrected snow albedo measurements compared to several models and of sublimation measured from lysimeter and <b>snow</b> <b>pillow</b> melt. We conclude with some thoughts on the future of CUES...|$|E
