25|$|Filippo Brunelleschi and Lorenzo Ghiberti {{were made}} joint {{leaders of the}} project to build the dome for Florence Cathedral in 1420. Brunelleschi's plan to use <b>suspended</b> <b>scaffolding</b> for the workers won out over {{alternatives}} such as building a provisional stone support column {{in the center of}} the crossing or filling the space with earth. The octagonal brick domical vault was built between 1420 and 1436, with Ghiberti resigning in 1433. The lantern surmounting the dome, also designed by Brunelleschi, was not begun until 1446, after his death. It was completed by Michelozzo di Bartolommeo and Bernardo Rossellino in 1467. Brunelleschi had also planned for a two-story external gallery and cornice to be built at the top of the drum where a strip of unclad masonry can be seen today. Although a portion of it was constructed on the southeast side beginning in 1508, work stopped after the visual effect was criticized by Michelangelo.|$|E
50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with <b>suspended</b> <b>scaffolding,</b> these are temporary work platforms typically erected from a lower level to gain access at height.|$|E

500|$|The next night, {{after they}} began the rehearsal, both singers had trouble {{performing}} {{the film version}} of the song. After hours of practice and confusion, they reached a compromise; they would sing a mash-up of the film and single versions, which featured an additional bridge and instrumentation by Edmonds. For the awards ceremony on the twenty first, Houston and Carey wore matching white gowns, symbolizing [...] "humbleness and simplicity." [...] Houston entered the arena, performing her verse, followed by Carey. As the song's finale drew near, a full gospel choir joined the performance from large <b>suspending</b> golden <b>scaffolding,</b> all wearing large white tunics. After the original was nominated for the Academy Award, Schwartz refused to give Edmonds writing credits in nomination forms submitted to the academy.|$|R
5000|$|Durwood {{replaced}} the Empire's three strip Cinerama with the seamless 70 mm film version. The 70 by 30 ft Walker Hi Gain motion picture screen {{was designed to}} collapse, fold, and store on stage within {{two and a half}} hours to allow for quick conversion for live stage events. The stage curtain measured more than 120 ft and claimed to be the world's largest. In keeping with Kansas City's reputation as the [...] "City of Fountains", the Empire included decorative fountains in the box office area and at the main staircase. The prominent signage <b>suspended</b> from <b>scaffolding</b> attached to the building's roof during the [...] "Mainstreet" [...] and [...] "RKO Missouri" [...] eras was removed when Durwood converted the theater to the Empire. The Empire kept an organist until 1961 when there was a dispute with the musicians' union.|$|R
50|$|Coglarse Como Tarzan (Hanging On Ropes Á La Tarzan): The Participantes will {{straddle}} {{across two}} platforms using ropes <b>suspended</b> on the <b>scaffolding</b> which is raised 15 {{meters from the}} ground. Those who complete the stunt are automatically exempted {{from the rest of}} the round. In case a Participante is unable to complete the stunt, the length of time spent on the stunt and the number of ropes swung before falling are also considered in the assessment. The two women and the two men with the best performances are exempted from the succeeding stunts. The worst performer will dance naked back at camp.|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} ten years of my career I practiced my craft — {{advertising}} art direction — exclusively by hand. To help me in the design process itself, I hired specialists. For typography, for instance, I chose a firm I admired in Minneapolis where the typographers would hand cut the film negatives letter by letter. In those days — the 1980 s — each area of design had master craftsmen. I can remember one day walking into a warehouse with thirty-foot ceilings. On the back wall I saw a large horizontal canvas. The artist was <b>suspended</b> from <b>scaffolding</b> and covered in speckled paint dots. I wasn’t in an artist’s studio looking at a masterpiece half-finished. I was admiring a billboard — a hand painted one-of-a-kind billboard. This {{is not to say}} that the old methods of working by hand were entirely idyllic. They had countless drawbacks. IT took several days to put together a layout with Pantone paper and transfer type, only to realize the color combination was wrong and the time wasted. Because processes were slow and labor-intensive, choices were limited. In the mid 1980 s, design studios and creative departments started using computers. For the first time I was able to select a color scheme, click a button, and see seemingly endless options instantaneously. It wasn’t long before the skilled craftsmen of type were replaced with digitized fonts loaded directly onto hard drives. Suddenly, the idea of working type by hand became economically unfeasible. The typographers closed up shop, threw out their old tools, and went out to look for new jobs. Several years later billboards were being painted on vinyl sheets right from our electronic files. Perfect replications of the original reproduced with speed and precision saved time and manpower. The new process had replaced the billboard artists almost overnight. I saw a generation of artisans exchanged for a generation of desktop publishers. Just like the craftsmen of the past, older methods of graphic design have been cast aside finding their way uneasily into the category of fine art. And now fine art, too, may cast them aside. Recently the Dean of the Fine Arts Program at Virginia Commonwealth University has held several meetings where he discussed the elimination of older printmaking methods in order to expand digital printmaking. Computers, it seems, will not be simply content with displacing the old hand processes; they want to eliminate them. For most young designers the computer has completely replaced the hand in every stage of the design process. I’ve noticed in many cases designers aren’t problem solving outside of the computer. It isn’t even considered. Certainly, the goal and outcome of my creative project were not intended to revive antiquated hand methods, at least as they historically existed. But hopefully, I’ve created something original by combining both hand methods and modern technology. If nothing else, I want younger designers to think beyond the 20 GB hard drive as the only tool in their process...|$|R
