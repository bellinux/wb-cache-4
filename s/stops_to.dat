5|$|A new organ was {{supplied}} to the abbey in 1895 by Norman and Beard of Norwich. It had 52 stops spread over four manuals and pedals, and stood divided on two steel beams in the North and South crossing arches, with the console {{standing on the}} floor next to the north-west pier of the crossing. New cases were to be provided to designs by Brian Oliver of Bath, but were never executed. Norman & Beard re-erected it in a new case designed by Sir Thomas Jackson in the North Transept in 1914, with the addition of two <b>stops</b> <b>to</b> the Pedal.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{conductors}} {{and engineers}} often {{knew where the}} locals lived or were headed, trains would make non-scheduled <b>stops</b> <b>to</b> disembark passengers to allow them a shorter walk. In the 1960s, the number of round trips was reduced to three per day, allowing the whole service to be operated with a single unit. NSB used steam power for freight trains until 1970, when NSB's last scheduled steam locomotive service hauled a gravel train from Svene to Kongsberg. For a short period during the 1980s, there were also school trains, but as this forced NSB to operate two multiple units on the line, it proved too expensive and was soon afterwards again provided by bus.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay {{corridor}} was one {{of twelve}} Queens bus corridors studied under the city's bus rapid transit (BRT) study, which was meant to determine the feasibility of having dedicated lanes and rebuilt <b>stops</b> <b>to</b> speed up service on BRT corridors. Beginning on January 4, 2008, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) conducted an 18-month study on Woodhaven Boulevard {{as part of the}} city's Congested Corridors Project to improve congested and dangerous roadways. One of the short-term recommendations {{of the study was to}} implement bus rapid transit along the corridor. In June 2010, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay corridor was added to the list of potential corridors for Phase II of Select Bus Service (SBS), the MTA's brand of BRT service.|$|E

5|$|It {{was again}} rebuilt by them in 1930, {{and then by}} Hill, Norman and Beard in 1948, which brought the number of <b>stops</b> <b>to</b> 58. In 1972 this was {{increased}} {{to a total of}} 65 speaking stops. The Positive division, with its separate case behind the console, was installed at the same time. Problems caused by the tonal scheme's lack of coherence– the 1895 pipework contrasting sharply with that of 1972– and with reliability, caused by the wide variety of different types of key actions, all difficult to access, led to the decision to have the instrument rebuilt yet again.|$|E
5|$|Johnson proclaimed {{amnesty for}} all former Confederates on December 25, 1868. Still in Canada, Breckinridge lingered {{for a few}} weeks to receive {{assurance}} that it still applied to him even though he had not been in the U.S. when it was issued. Departing Canada on February 10, 1869, he made several <b>stops</b> <b>to</b> visit family and friends along the route to Lexington, where he arrived on March 9. Although he resided in Kentucky {{for the rest of his}} life, he never bought a home there after the war, living first in hotels and then renting a home on West Second Street.|$|E

Morrow is directed to safety, while Reyes <b>stops</b> <b>to</b> confront one of the prisoners, a member of the gang who were responsible for him becoming the Ghost Rider. The prisoner reveals that they were hired to carry out the job, but does not know who by, before the Ghost Rider murders him.

5|$|On December 31, 1936, the IND Queens Boulevard Line was {{extended}} by eight stops, and , from its previous terminus at Roosevelt Avenue to Union Turnpike. The {{construction of the}} extension to Kew Gardens brought significant growth to Queens, specifically in Forest Hills and Kew Gardens. New apartment buildings were being built {{as a result of}} the subway line, and it transformed both Forest Hills and Kew Gardens from quiet residential communities of one-family houses to active population centers. Following the line's completion, there was an increase in the property values of buildings around Queens Boulevard. On April 24, 1937, the IND Queens Boulevard Line {{was extended}} four <b>stops</b> <b>to</b> 169th Street, with 169th Street and Parsons Boulevard serving as terminals.|$|E

5|$|The {{mail pouch}} was a {{separate}} component to the saddle {{that made the}} Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many <b>stops</b> <b>to</b> make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a mochila, or covering of leather, was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.|$|E
5|$|Before {{leaving the}} next morning, the Doctor <b>stops</b> <b>to</b> ask Emma {{if she could}} sense {{anything}} unusual about Clara, but Emma reveals that Clara seems normal to her. The Doctor offers Hila a lift to any other place in history and concludes {{that she is a}} direct descendant of Emma and Palmer. He reasons that their relation resulted in a blood connection that helped them open the gateway to rescue her. While contemplating the bonds that love can create, the Doctor suddenly realises that there is another creature within Caliburn House. Just as Emma and Palmer were not part of a ghost story but a love story, the Doctor considers the same for the creatures — that the one trapped in the pocket universe has been trying to reunite with its mate. The Doctor asks Emma for a favour and they use Emma and the TARDIS to retrieve the other creature from the pocket universe.|$|E
5|$|Bottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen and Räikkönen made pit <b>stops</b> <b>to</b> {{change to}} {{intermediate}} tyres on lap 12. After his early pit stop, Button {{moved up to}} eighth place on the lap. Massa and Vettel made their pit stops the following lap, with Vettel moving in front of Massa and rejoining ahead of teammate Ricciardo. Rosberg made his pit stop on the 14th lap and rejoined in second position, 22 seconds behind Hamilton (who recorded fast sector times {{in an attempt to}} move ahead of Rosberg after the latter's pit stop). Hamilton went off the track at the Spoon Curve, rejoining the race at the run-off area. The mistake reduced the time deficit by one second. Rosberg reclaimed first position when Hamilton approached the exit of the pit lane after the latter's stop. He reported that his car was oversteering, and Button held a 6.5-second advantage over both Williams cars. The Red Bull cars reduced the gap to Massa in sixth by lap 16, and began a challenge for the position. Vettel moved to the inside lane and passed Massa with a narrow margin at the hairpin on the lap. Although Ricciardo attempted a similar manoeuvre on the outside at the Spoon Curve, Massa accelerated clear heading into 130R corner.|$|E
