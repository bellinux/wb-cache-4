Collis's judgments were (according to his own analysis) too independent to be pleasing to the then British Government of Burma, arousing the particular disapproval of his superior, Booth Gravely, Commissioner of the <b>Pegu</b> <b>Division.</b> After giving judgment in the last of these trials Collis was hastily moved to the post of Excise Commissioner.|$|R
50|$|Danionella translucida is an {{extremely}} small (1.1 cm long) species of cyprinid fish endemic to Myanmar. When described, it {{was considered to be}} the smallest freshwater vertebrate. It was collected from the roots of floating aquatic plants in a slow-flowing, shallow stream (maximum depth 1 m) in the <b>Pegu</b> <b>Division</b> of Myanmar. It was found alongside Danio, Microrasbora, Erethistes, and Oryzias species. Observed in life, D. translucida is almost perfectly transparent except for its eyes. It has a distinctive pattern of melanophores. There are no melanophores on the dorsal surface except on the head over the posterior part of the brain. On the posterior half of the body, there a few melanophores following the horizontal midline. The sides and underside of the abdomen have melanophores. A double row of melanophores is present {{on the underside of the}} fish from the isthmus of the gills to the pelvic fins. Eggs in D. translucida has been found to range in size from about 0.3 - 0.6 mm in diameter, with ripe eggs being at least 0.5 mm in diameter. Females carried anywhere from 3 to 8 or 10 eggs. Compared to the body of the fish, these eggs are relatively large.|$|R

30|$|The {{intermediate}} horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus affinis Andersen, is {{a medium-sized}} bat (forearm length 45 to 56 mm) distributed widely in South and Southeast Asia, including northern India (including Andaman Islands), Nepal to southern China, mainland Southeast Asia, Borneo, Java, and nearby islands (Francis 2008; Simmons 2005). The taxon includes nine recognized subspecies throughout its range: R. affinis affinis Horsfield (type locality Java), R. a. andamanensis Dobson (type locality South Andaman Island), R. a. himalayanus Andersen (type locality Mussoorie, Kumaon Division, northern India), R. a. tener Andersen (type locality <b>Pegu</b> <b>Division,</b> recently known as Bago, Myanmar), R. a. macrurus Andersen (type locality Taho, Karennee, Kyah State, Myanmar), R. a. superans Andersen (Pahang, peninsular Malaysia), R. a. nesite Andersen (type locality Bunguran Island, North Natunas, Indonesia), R. a. princeps Andersen (type locality Lombok, Lesser Sunda Island), and R. a. hainanus Allen (type locality Pouten, Hainan Island). The geographical {{scope of the}} present study is limited to mainland Southeast Asia and as such includes the range of three of these forms (Andersen 1905): R. a. tener, R. a. macrurus, and R. a. superans. R. a. tener is a small rhinolophid with a short tail and a relatively large horseshoe; R. a. macrurus is described as being more moderate in size with large ears, a long tail, and a broad horseshoe (Sinha 1973); while R. a. superans is described as similar to R. macrurus but with short tail (Andersen 1905).|$|R
50|$|In 2001, Myo Pyauk Hmar Soe Kyauk Sa Yar (or) The Fear of Losing One's Race {{and many}} other anti-Muslim {{pamphlets}} were widely distributed by monks. Many Muslims feel that this exacerbated the anti-Muslim feelings that had been provoked by {{the destruction of the}} Buddhas of Bamiyan in Afghanistan. On 15 May 2001, anti-Muslim riots broke out in Taungoo, <b>Pegu</b> <b>division,</b> resulting in the deaths of about 200 Muslims, in the destruction of 11 mosques and the setting ablaze of over 400 houses. On 15 May, {{the first day of the}} anti-Muslim uprisings, about 20 Muslims who were praying in the Han Tha mosque were killed and some were beaten to death by the pro-junta forces. On 17 May, Lt. General Win Myint, Secretary No. 3 of the SPDC and deputy Home and Religious minister, arrived in Taungoo and curfew was imposed there until 12 July 2001. Buddhist monks demanded that the ancient Han Tha Mosque in Taungoo be destroyed in retaliation for the destruction in Bamiyan. On 18 May, the Han Tha mosque and Taungoo Railway station mosque were razed to the ground by bulldozers owned by the SPDC junta. The mosques in Taungoo remained closed as of May 2002. Muslims have been forced to worship in their homes. Local Muslim leaders complain that they are still harassed. After the violence, many local Muslims moved away from Taungoo to nearby towns and to as far away as Yangon. After two days of violence the military stepped in and the violence immediately ended.|$|R
