40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} protein 2 (MRP 2) {{belongs to}} the ATP binding cassette family of transporters. Its substrates include organic anions and anticancer drugs. We have used transport assays with vesicles derived from Sf 9 insect cells overproducing MRP 2 to study the interactions of drugs, organic anions, and bile acids with three MRP 2 substrates: estradiol- 17 -beta-d-glucuronide (E 217 betaG), methotrexate, and glutathione-S-dinitrophenol. Complex inhibition and stimulation patterns were obtained, different from those observed with the related transporters MRP 1 and MRP 3. In contrast to a previous report, {{we found that the}} rate of E 217 betaG transport by MRP 2 increases sigmoidally with substrate concentration indicative of homotropic cooperativity. Half-maximal transport was obtained at 120 microm E 217 betaG, in contrast to values < 20 microm for MRP 1 and 3. MRP 2 stimulators, such as indomethacin and <b>sulfanitran,</b> strongly increased the affinity of MRP 2 for E 217 betaG (half-maximal transport rates at 65 and 16 microm E 217 betaG, respectively) and shifted the sigmoidal dependence of transport rate on substrate concentration to a more hyperbolic one, without substantially affecting the maximal transport rate. <b>Sulfanitran</b> also stimulated MRP 2 activity in cells, i. e. the transport of saquinavir through monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells. Some compounds that stimulate E 217 betaG transport, such as penicillin G or pantoprazole, are not detectably transported by MRP 2, suggesting that they allosterically stimulate transport without being cotransported with E 217 betaG. We propose that MRP 2 contains two similar but nonidentical ligand binding sites: one site from which substrate is transported and a second site that regulates the affinity of the transport site for the substrat...|$|E
