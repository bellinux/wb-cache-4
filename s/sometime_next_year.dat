40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field {{has taken}} the lead in the {{development}} of practical densified cryogenic propellants for launch vehicle applications. The technology of subcooling cryogenic propellants below their normal boiling point to produce a denser fluid {{is one of the key}} process technologies necessary to meet the challenge of single-stage-to-orbit and reusable launch vehicles. Densified propellants are critical to lowering launch costs because they enable more propellant to be packed into a given unit volume, thus improving the performance by reducing the overall size and weight of the launch vehicle. This two-pronged research and test program has evolved into (1) conducting tank loading tests using densified liquid hydrogen and (2) developing two large-scale propellant densification systems that will be performance tested <b>next</b> <b>year</b> at Glenn. The propellant-loading test program was undertaken at Glenn in coordination with Lockheed Martin Michoud Space Systems. In this testing, the liquid hydrogen recirculation and densification process was simulated, and the thermal stratification of the densified propellant was recorded throughout the tank. The test article was a flight-weight tank constructed from composite materials similar to those to be used on the X- 33 launch vehicle. The tank geometry as designed by Lockheed Martin had two cylindrical lobes with a center septum. Liquid hydrogen flow rate, pressure data, and temperature data plotted over time were collected while the subscale tank was filled with 27 R (15 K) densified liquid hydrogen propellant. This testing has validated mathematical models and demonstrated the readiness of densified propellant technology for near-term use. It marks the first time that such a process has been carried out with a multiple-lobe, flight-similar tank. Glenn researchers have also been working on providing a process and critical test data for the continuous production of densified liquid hydrogen (LH 2) and densified liquid oxygen (LO 2). Each densification production process uses a high-efficiency, subatmospheric boiling bath heat exchanger to cool the working fluid. A near triple-point hydrogen boiling bath is used to condition and subcool hydrogen to 27 R (15 K), and a nitrogen boiling bath is used to cool the liquid oxygen to 120 R (66. 7 K). Multistage centrifugal compressors operating at cryogenic inlet conditions maintain the heat exchanger bath vapor pressure below 1 atm. The LO 2 propellant densification unit shown in the photograph has a 30 lb/sec capacity, whereas the LH 2 unit was designed to process 8 lb/sec of propellant. Each densification unit will be transported to Glenn's South Forty area after all fabrication work is completed <b>sometime</b> late <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> There the LO 2 and LH 2 densifier performance tests will be conducted with another larger Lockheed Martin tank designated the Structural Test Article (STA). This liquid oxygen tank is a full-scale, flight-weight, prototype aluminum tank designed for the X- 33. It has a capacity of 20, 000 gallons of LO 2. The tank loading and recirculation testing planned for <b>next</b> <b>year</b> with STA will provide the data necessary for full-scale development of propellant densification technology...|$|R
40|$|Masteroppgave i informasjons- og kommunikasjonsteknologi 2001 - Høgskolen i Agder, GrimstadIn {{the future}} it is expectable {{that the number}} of {{terminals}} with wireless access to network resources will be more and more widespread, and it is therefore necessary to integrate mobility support into future generation networks so that users can be online, even while in motion. The increasing use of Internet suggests that the Internet technology can be the best candidate for effective realization of future generation mobile systems. Mobile IP can offer the possibility for use of the mobile Internet in other ways than it is used in the standard wired environment, and may be the solution to increasing mobility demands. Due to this, mobility in IPv 6 (MIPv 6) is designed to be scalable, stable, efficient and secure, which are the factors considered important for this thesis. Scalable – The number of users are expected to be so many that MIPv 6 is, according to its specification, designed to scale almost as well as Internet without mobility support integrated. This implies the elimination of triangle routing, currently a challenge in MIPv 4, and also a reasonable amount of data that must be managed by the nodes involved in mobility. MIPv 6 is also designed so that future extensions and modifications are possible by allowing further growth. Stable – For the adoption rate of this technology to high, the users must be able to depend on the services provided. At present the implementations shows that there are still a few more steps to take until necessary stability is offered, but product quality releases of MIPv 6 is expected to be released <b>sometime</b> <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> The implementation tested in this thesis reflects transparent mobility as to simple higher-level applications such as telnet and [URL] but not real-time applications. The implementation described in this thesis had some initial problems with the procedures for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD), which shall guarantee that all addresses on any given IPv 6 network is unique. Some improvements for DAD have therefore been proposed in order to get better solutions as to fault-handling procedures when DAD fails. Efficient – Base MIPv 6 as used in our implementation does not provide the handover efficiency needed for all kinds of applications. Seen from a traditional Internet point of view, the services offered are of best effort quality. A future version of the Internet protocol must, however, be designed to support applications with greater demands to handover latencies, than what a best effort service level can provide. Thus, the handover latency must in these cases be so small that it goes within the boundaries for e. g. demanding real-time applications. Several solutions are proposed for this purpose, but the area of research is still very new and no proposal will be defined for still some time. It seems like the initial mobility deployment phase will be without support for these services, but the technology is very promising and will most likely be integrated as the use of MIPv 6 advances. Secure – In a large mobile environment mobile nodes will not only require Internet access within their own domain. They will also probably visit foreign networks, and as known from GSM infrastructure today, this will not be free of charge. Service providers in foreign domains commonly require authorization to ensure a good business relationship with the client. This leads directly to authentication, and of course accounting (AAA). This AAA infrastructure should be in place before mobile Internet can be deployed worldwide...|$|E
