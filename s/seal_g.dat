Most of {{heat transfer}} augmentation methods {{presented in the}} literature that assists fins and microfins in enhancing heat transfer are reviewed. Among these are using joint-fins, fin roots, fin networks, biconvections, permeable fins, porous fins, capsulated liquid metal fins, and helical microfins. It is found that not much agreement exists between works of the different authors regarding single phase heat transfer augmented with microfins. However, too many works having sufficient agreements {{have been done in}} the case of two phase heat transfer augmented with microfins. With respect to nanofluids, there are still many conflicts among the published works about both heat transfer enhancement levels and the corresponding mechanisms of augmentations. The reasons beyond these conflicts are reviewed. In addition, this paper describes flow and heat transfer in porous media as a well-modeled passive enhancement method. It is found that there are very few works which dealt with heat transfer enhancements using systems supported with flexible/flexible-complex seals. Eventually, many recent works related to passive augmentations of heat transfer using vortex generators, protrusions, and ultra high thermal conductivity composite material are reviewed.

Method: The study analyzed fifty lateral teleradiographs of which 25 were of subjects with labial incompetence, with minimum opening of 4 mm, and 25 of subjects with labial sealing, {{none of the}} subjects having undergone orthodontic treatment, all being between 15 and 30 years of age, irrespective of gender and malocclusion, with slight tendency towards vertical growth. The following cephalometric variables were used: Nfp – Nfa {{with the objective of}} determining the width of the upper airway, Sn – St to measure the length of the upper lip, Sn –IIs for the vertical length of the maxilla and 1. NA to determine the inclination of the maxillary incisor. Results: The measurements obtained in the group of passive lip <b>sealing</b> (<b>G</b> 1) and labial incompetence (G 2) respectively, were as follows: 14. 12 mm (G 1) and 12. 76 mm (G 2) for width of the upper airway; 24. 24 mm (G 1) and 23. 80 mm (G 2) for the length of the upper lip; 26. 92 mm (G 1) and 28. 64 mm (G 2) for the vertical length of the maxilla and 26. 76 º (G 1) and 30. 76 º (G 2) for the inclination of themaxillary incisor.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{effects of the}} construction and operation of wind farms at sea on marine life is a pertinent question in today’s world. Although for this report we focus on harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), wind farms {{have the potential to}} affect all marine life, including marine mammals, fish, birds, and benthic species. Indeed research has shown that effects of the construction and or operation of wind farms on marine life occur; for example on <b>seals</b> (e. <b>g.</b> Edrén et al., 2004), harbour porpoises (e. g.

30|$|Inversely, the G and NS blend (which has 50 % {{weight of}} G) tends to {{decrease}} the sealing ability with the aging time. While the NS improved the <b>sealing</b> pressure, the <b>G</b> strongly decreased the sealing ability of the mixture. The previous study about LCM shear degradation presented the idea about the decrease in size of LCM particles under the dynamic flow of drilling fluids (Valsecchi 2014). The degree of degradation of LCM depends on {{the density of the}} particles, the density of drilling fluids, the size of particles, and the fluid viscosity. It was possible that some of the G particles decreased their sizes under the rolling conditions, resulting in lower sealing efficiency. Further study is needed to understand the behavior of G under these aging conditions.|$|R
40|$|Intense {{international}} {{concern has}} arisen over the potential effects of anthropogenic sound on protected marine wildlife. To study this issue presents a challenge, however, because marine animals in captivity form a limited sample set that cannot always be extrapolated to wild populations, while {{those in the}} wild spend {{the majority of their}} time submerged and out of sight of researchers. Thus instrumentation to monitor the behavior and sound exposure of wild, free-ranging marine animals is essential. Broadband acoustic recording tags offer a promising avenue for studying the relationship between behavior and sound exposure for free-ranging animals. Since 1995, when the first combined broadband-acoustic and behavior recorders were deployed with northern elephant seals (Burgess et al., 1998) such tags – predominantly the DTAG (Johnson and Tyack, 2003) and the Bioacoustic Probe (Burgess, 2000; Figure 1) – have seen extensive use in the study of baleen whales, sperm whales, and <b>seals</b> (e. <b>g.,</b> Insley et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2004; Oleson et al., 2007). These studies have generated a dramatic quantity of acoustic, depth, and orientation data, and as combined acoustic/behavior tags become increasingly available the amount of data will continue to grow. This rapid expansion of data will not, however, support the commensurate expansion of study and understanding unless the wider research community is equipped to process and interpret those data effectively. ...|$|R

For ISH 2007 we presented a new theoretical approach to detect small gas leakages in SF 6 switchgear.

In a typical contemplated application, the radially varying clamping pressure {{would be used to}} obtain more nearly uniform compression on a pair of concentric <b>seals</b> (e. <b>g.,</b> an O-ring or a gasket) in an assembly that experiences larger deformations normal to the sealing surface for locations around the outer diameter of the attachment flange when compared to locations around the inner diameter. The VPW (see figure) would include two interlocking channel rings pushed axially away from each other by compression spring-like components located at two or more radial positions. Each spring would have a different stiffness based on the radial location. Overlapping splits in each interlocking channel ring would allow for the non-uniform deformation in the rings. Each spring would be held in place by retaining cups attached to the inner flat surfaces of the channel rings. A plunger attached to one channel ring on the central axis would be captured in a plunger housing attached to the other channel ring: The capture of the plunger would hold the VPW together. When the VPW was clamped between two flat surfaces, the clamping force would be distributed unevenly across the face of the washer in the radial direction.

They are captured in traps using primarily forage fish (e. g. anchovies, herring, and menhaden), as bait. Approximately 18 {{million tons of}} these fish are used annually to bait traps, worldwide (U. Nations, 2014). In addition to natural predators dependent on forage fish (Pikitch et al., 2012), myriad other factors are further intensifying demand and collectively threatening stocks (e. g.

Forage fish capture methods pose collateral environmental risks from by-catch (e. <b>g.</b> <b>seals,</b> dolphins, turtles) indiscriminately killed in nets. Sustainable alternatives to stem further depletion are desperately needed, and toward this end, a synthetic crustacean bait has been developed. The technology mimics molecules released from forage fish by employing a formulation that is dispersed at a controlled rate from a soluble matrix. The synthetic bait reliably caught stone crab, blue crab, and American lobster in field trials.

When using artificial <b>sealing</b> materials (e. <b>g.</b> a geomembrane) as the capping liner, the stability of the cover soils and integrity of the geosynthethics need to be assessed. Traditional design methods only consider uniform cover soil thickness with different degrees of saturation and seepage build-up (i. e. parallel submergency ratio). This paper proposes an analytical method which includes the seepage build-up in the stability analysis for the capping slope with a tapered cover soil profile, that is when cover soils become thicker from top to bottom. Both the parallel (modified) and horizontal seepage force build-up patterns have been considered and analysed. The proposed analytical methods are applied to a design case in which uniform thickness cover soils are considered. The results are comparable to those of the traditional methods and therefore they are verified. Parametric analyses have confirmed the tapered profile can effectively improve the capping slope stability and indicated that the interface shear strength (between the cover soil and the underlying geosynthetic) and cover soil shear strength have the most significant effects on the capping slope stability...|$|R
