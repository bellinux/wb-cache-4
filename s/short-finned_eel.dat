40|$|In Taiwan, a local {{fish farm}} had {{imported}} 300 <b>short-finned</b> <b>eels,</b> Anguilla australis schmidti, from an unknown country. The infected eels showed anorrhexia, poor appetite, lost of activity, and a decreased escape-reaction. In five weeks, about 130 <b>short-finned</b> <b>eels</b> died. The total mortality was above 43 % (130 / 300). The results of necropsy of the eels included petechial hemorrhages {{on the surface}} of the stomach serosa and serious atrophy of fat tissue. Simultaneously, adult red worms were discovered in the peritoneal cavity, abdominal wall, organs, and intestinal serosa of those diseased eels. Identification of parasites revealed five different species of parasites: Anisakis sp., Eustrongyloides sp., Echinorhynchus gadi, Lepidopus caudatus, and Brachyphallus crenatu.

5000|$|The fish {{assemblage}} of the Snowy River below Jindabyne are clearly {{divided into two}} components. This division is based on that which occurred in the upper catchment (above Snowy Falls) {{and that in the}} lower catchment (below Snowy Falls). [...] The major differences between the two zones were the low abundance or absence of diadromous migratory fish (except eels) and the greater abundance of <b>short-finned</b> <b>eel</b> and trout in the upper catchment, and the greater abundance of Australian smelt, congoli and long-finned eel below Snowy Falls. These upper and lower Snowy River zone differences were greater than the differences between un-regulated tributary streams and the highly regulated main channel of the Snowy River within either zone. In the upper catchment, river blackfish, brown trout and <b>short-finned</b> <b>eel</b> were more abundant in un-regulated tributaries, whilst long-finned eel and goldfish were more abundant in the regulated upper part of the Snowy River. In the lower zone, eastern gambusia, long-finned eel, Australian smelt, <b>short-finned</b> <b>eel</b> and congoli were all more abundant in Snowy River while common galaxias and short-headed lamprey were more abundant at tributaries.|$|E

25|$|The {{tertiary}} education sector undertakes {{a small amount}} of aquaculture research. In 2007 an aquaculture centre was opened at Mahurangi Technical Institute in Warkworth. Scientists at the institute are aiming to breed <b>short-fin</b> <b>eels</b> within two years with a goal of producing commercial quantities of eels in captivity, which would be a world first.|$|R
50|$|Like other anguillids, <b>short-finned</b> <b>eels</b> {{are remarkably}} hardy: they can {{tolerate}} high water temperatures and low oxygen concentrations, endure long periods without food, and bury themselves in mud or sand and enter an energy-saving torpor {{when the water}} temperature drops below 10°C. They {{are one of the}} few Australian freshwater fish to have coped well with the wholesale introduction of European and American species.|$|R
50|$|Water {{temperature}} has {{a notable}} affect on the metabolic activity of fish species. Anguillids can withstand {{a wide variety}} of temperatures but the optimum temperature in cultured species is between 22°C and 28°C- at this temperature growth is maximised Recent work has determined that the optimal water temperature is for maximal growth of <b>short-finned</b> <b>eels</b> is 26.5°C, and salinity is optimum at 17.5%. These parameters were shown to give the highest mean specific growth rate of these eels. It has been shown in the European eel that they achieve higher growth when in saline. Much research continues in this area.|$|R

50|$|Anguillid eels are {{important}} food fish. Eel aquaculture is a fast-growing industry. Important food eel species include longfin eel, Australian long-finned eel, <b>short-finned</b> <b>eel,</b> and Japanese eel. Most eel production historically {{has been in}} Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, but in recent years, the greatest production has been in China.|$|E
50|$|The Pacific shortfinned eel (Anguilla obscura), {{also known}} as the Pacific shortfinned {{freshwater}} eel, the <b>short-finned</b> <b>eel,</b> and the South Pacific eel, is an eel in the family Anguillidae. It was described by Albert Günther in 1871. It is a tropical, freshwater eel which is known from western New Guinea, Queensland, Australia, the Society Islands, and possibly South Africa. The eels spend most of their lives in freshwater, but migrate to the Pacific Ocean to breed. Males can reach a maximum total length of 110 centimetres, but more commonly reach a TL of around 60 cm. The Pacific shortfinned eel is most similar to Anguilla australis (more commonly known as the <b>Short-finned</b> <b>eel),</b> and Anguilla bicolor (the Indonesian shortfin eel), but can be distinguished by the number of vertebrae.|$|E
50|$|The {{main reason}} that the {{aquaculture}} of Anguillid eels has become more popular in recent times is that the wild seed supply cannot support the demand of the consumer. Because of declining catches of both the European and Japanese glass eels, seed from the <b>short-finned</b> <b>eels</b> is at a commercial premium. The increasing pressure on eels has led to reduced recruitment of juveniles of angullid species which limits the industry and potentially leads to ecological impacts. Supply of seed to aquaculture operations of these eels relies solely on wild stocks of glass eels. These stocks are declining and there is now pressure being placed {{on the development of}} intensive eel culture technology. Anguillid eels cannot be reared from eggs in a culture setting, it is the glass eels caught from wild stock that are reared.|$|R
25|$|Spawning grounds are {{the areas}} of water where aquatic animals spawn, or produce their eggs. After spawning, the spawn {{may or may not}} drift to new grounds which become their nursery grounds. Many species {{undertake}} migrations each year, and sometimes great migrations, to reach their spawning grounds. For example, lakes and river watersheds can be major spawning grounds for anadromous fish such as salmon. These days, it is often necessary to construct fish ladders and other bypass systems so salmon can navigate their way past hydroelectric dams or other obstructions such as weirs on their way to spawning grounds. Coastal fish often use mangroves and estuaries as spawning grounds, while reef fish can find adjacent seagrass meadows that make good spawning grounds. <b>Short-finned</b> <b>eels</b> can travel anything up to three or four thousand kilometres to their spawning ground in deep water somewhere in the Coral Sea.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>short-finned</b> <b>eels</b> make {{excellent}} eating, {{there is}} global demand for them. The major market is Japan with smaller markets {{in other parts}} of Asia and in Europe. Aquaculture is the single fastest growing animal food producing sector in the world, having an annual growth rate of 6.9%. The worldwide production of Anguillid eels from aquaculture is estimated to be 242 000 t per annum with a value of $US 1 billion. Chinese eel aquaculture production has increased dramatically over the last 10 years, now accounting for 75% of the total annual world production, and relies on the demand of the Japanese market. Techniques for artificial breeding of the Japanese eel 'A. japonica' have been studied intensively since the 1960s. It is difficult to rear these animals in captivity, the main problem being incomplete techniques for inducing sexual maturation and incomplete rearing techniques of larvae.However the main way that full growth of oocytes is achieved is by repeated injections of salmon pituitary extracts, and also additions of other hormones.|$|R
50|$|The ponds {{are one of}} {{only three}} {{recorded}} locations for the golden pygmy perch (Nannoperca variegata). Other fish life includes schools of <b>short-finned</b> <b>eel,</b> river blackfish, pouched lampreys, mullet and common galaxias. The ponds are also home to populations of flatworms, freshwater crayfish and mussels, and the larva of the carnivorous caddis fly.|$|E
50|$|The <b>short-finned</b> <b>eel</b> (Anguilla australis), {{also known}} as the shortfin eel, is one of the 15 species of eel in the family Anguillidae. It is native to the lakes, dams and coastal rivers of {{south-eastern}} Australia, New Zealand, and much of the South Pacific, including New Caledonia, Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island, Tahiti, and Fiji.|$|E
50|$|Before European {{settlement}} {{the area}} around Lake Burrumbeet was inhabited and frequented by the Burrumbeet balug clan of the Wada wurrung people. The area would have provided {{a good source of}} food, particularly <b>short-finned</b> <b>eel.</b> The name Burrumbeet derives from the local aboriginal word burrumbidj meaning 'muddy or dirty water'. Some artifacts and tools have been found on the northern edge of the lake in the past.|$|E
40|$|Spawning {{migration}} by {{freshwater eels}} to their marine spawning grounds {{is widely considered}} to be direct and rapid; however, emerging evidence suggests that eel migratory behaviour {{is more complex than}} previously thought, with potential implications for eel conservation and management. Over a 5 -year period, we tagged 97 yellow-phase <b>short-finned</b> <b>eels</b> Anguilla australis with acoustic transmitters in the freshwater reaches of a south-eastern Australian river to: (i) examine environmental correlates associated with seaward migration; (ii) test the hypothesis that migration is rapid and direct once initiated and (iii) assess individual variation in behaviour associated with seaward migration. Twenty-three of the tagged eels migrated from fresh water into the estuary, whilst the remainder stayed within fresh water. Movement was detected primarily at night and eels entered the estuary throughout the year, with an increase in frequency over summer and following high river flows. Time in the estuary ranged from 1 to 305 days (median: 77 days). Movement into the sea was influenced primarily by the lunar phase, and to a lesser degree by water temperature, and occurred from late summer to early autumn. The extended residence and complex movements of migrating eels in the estuary suggest that they are considerably more vulnerable to exploitation than would be predicted by the generalised eel migration model of direct movement out to sea...|$|R
5000|$|They were {{traditionally}} {{river and}} lake people, with Framlingham Forest, Lake Condah {{and the surrounding}} river systems being of great importance to them economically and spiritually. Numerous distinct structures, extending over 100 square kilometres of the landscape, were employed {{for the purpose of}} farming eels, the staple of the Gunditjmara diet. These include stone races; canals; traps; stone walls; stone house sites and stone cairns. A controversy exists concerning {{the extent to which these}} features are the results of natural environmental processes or cultural modifications of the landscape by indigenous people. Peter Coutts and others argued, in a work entitled Aboriginal Engineers of the Western District, Victoria, that numerous features shown the handiwork of aboriginal landscaping for economic purposes. This thesis was challenged as a mythical'romancing of the landscape' by Dr. Anne Clarke, on that confused natural processes with socially crafted infrastructure.Fresh archaeological work by Dr Heather Builth led to her contending that they had a sophisticated system of aquaculture and eel farming. They built stone dams to hold the water in these swampy volcanic areas, esp. the Budj Bim ('top of head sticking out') area, creating ponds and wetlands in which they harvested <b>Short-finned</b> <b>eels</b> (kuyang) from Vanuatu and New Caledonia and other fish. They also created channels linking these wetlands. These channels contained weirs with large woven baskets made by women to cull mature eels. Professor Peter Kershaw, a Monash University palynologist found evidence of a sudden change in vegetation consistent with an artificial ponding system, and initial radiocarbon dating of the soil samples suggest the ponds were created up to 8,000 years ago. The eels were prepared by smoking them with burning leaves from Australian blackwood. The coastal clans, like other tribes on the south-west coast, according to an early settler, Thomas Browne, had a rich fish diet, which included whale (cunderbul) flesh, ...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of native and {{introduced}} fish in the waters of the reserve. Native fish include species such as Climbing galaxias, Fire-tail Gudgeon, and <b>Short-finned</b> and Long-finned <b>Eels.</b> The Climbing galaxias inhabits some of the less disturbed creeks and is able to climb up wet rock faces and cliffs with the aid of ridges on its fins, can breathe through its skin, and has lived in this once remote area, for an estimated 60 million years. Australian Bass once occurred naturally in Curl Curl Creek but were unable to recolonise upstream areas once the dam wall was built in 1892 and blocked their access. Young Bass fingerlings are now regularly stocked into the dam by the NSW Department of Primary Industries to cater for recreational fishermen. A lone stocking of Silver Perch occurred in the early 1990s but these have not been stocked since as they are not native to the catchment area. Some of the introduced species include European Carp, Goldfish and the pest fish Gambusia. Unfortunately the dam is now also home to a large population of Redfin which were illegally introduced and now prey on many of the smaller fishes.|$|R

Cichlids and other tropical fish that were released into the lake by the public have established populations, including Convict cichlids (Cryptoheros nigrofasciatus) and the African cichlid spotted tilapia (Tilapia mariae). Other fish include carp, goldfish (Carassius auratus), Gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki), and the native <b>short-finned</b> <b>eel</b> (Anguilla australis) and Australian smelt (Retropinna semoni).|$|E
50|$|Aquatic fauna once {{included}} {{fish species}} such as <b>short-finned</b> <b>eel,</b> common galaxias, flat-headed gudgeon and small-mouth hardyhead.

50|$|For the Māori {{people of}} New Zealand, starved of protein after the {{extinction}} of New Zealand megafauna, the <b>short-finned</b> <b>eel</b> was a significant food resource.

Māori people had an extensive knowledge of the ecology of eels and harvested them through a variety of techniques. Present-day recreational anglers catch and eat them regularly, and New Zealand has a well-established commercial eel fishery. Māori are now concerned that the commercial fishery is compromising their ability to harvest short-finned eels for ceremonial purposes.|$|E
