25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, figure skating was lent a more athletic character through the developments of Ulrich Salchow, a Swede. Salchow was considered the greatest figure skater of his day by far, winning the world championships ten times. The crowning achievement of his career, however, was his development of ice skates with slightly <b>serrated</b> <b>blades,</b> giving enough traction on the ice to launch long jumps. The salchow jump, still used prominently in figure skating routines today, is named for him, and was considered Salchow's greatest contribution to figure skating.|$|E

2500|$|The SARK, PSARK, and NSAR, {{like all}} of Emerson's knives, {{are made in the}} USA. All three models have a wharncliffe shaped chisel-ground blade that is [...] long and {{hardened}} to a Rockwell hardness of 57-59 RC. The handle is [...] long, making the knife [...] in length when opened. The blade steel is Crucible's 154CM and is [...] thick. The butt-end of the knife is square-shaped and features a hole for tying a lanyard. Some models are made with partially <b>serrated</b> <b>blades</b> to aid in the cutting of seatbelts or webbing.|$|E

2500|$|Knives are {{sharpened}} {{in various}} ways. Flat ground blades have a profile that tapers from the thick spine to the sharp edge {{in a straight}} or [...] line. Seen in cross section, the blade would form a long, thin triangle, or where the taper does not extend {{to the back of}} the blade, a long thin rectangle with one peaked side. Hollow ground blades have , beveled edges. The resulting blade has a thinner edge, so it may have better cutting ability for shallow cuts, but it is lighter and less durable than flat ground blades and will tend to bind in deep cuts. Serrated blade knives have a wavy, scalloped or saw-like blade. <b>Serrated</b> <b>blades</b> are more well suited for tasks that require aggressive 'sawing' motions, whereas plain edge blades are better suited for tasks that require push-through cuts (e.g., shaving, chopping, slicing).|$|E

5000|$|A {{grapefruit}} knife is {{a special}} type of knife designed specifically for cutting grapefruit. Grapefruit knives are small with a curved <b>serrated</b> <b>blade,</b> designed to hug the curves of the grapefruit. This is used to separate {{the outer edge of}} the segments from the rim of the fruit. The term [...] "grapefruit knife" [...] can refer to a type of knife with short, <b>serrated</b> twin <b>blades</b> about 2mm apart, used to separate the sides of each section from the dividing membrane. Some grapefruit knives incorporate both types, a double-sided curved blade on one side and the parallel twin blades on the other. Another type includes an angled tip and double sided <b>serrated</b> <b>blade.</b> When both types are used, the result is an intact-looking fruit with sections which lift out easily - especially if a [...] "grapefruit spoon" [...] is used.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experiment {{with a knife}} seized as material evidence in a homicide case. The reason for the experiment was the necessity {{to determine whether the}} injuries of the deceased could have been inflicted with this instrument since {{in the course of the}} investigation doubt arose as to the origin of linear, parallel scratches around one of the wounds and on the abdominal integuments suggesting a <b>serrated</b> <b>blade.</b> The knife found near the crime scene had a smooth blade and small serrations only on the borderline between its blade and hilt. However, the performed experiment showed that if the knife is directed towards the integuments of the body in a special way, its serrations, even though not located on the blade itself, may leave such striated marks on the body, as those found during the autopsy, suggesting their origin from a <b>serrated</b> <b>blade...</b>|$|R
50|$|Cuts {{made with}} a {{serrated}} blade are typically less smooth and precise than cuts {{made with a}} smooth blade. <b>Serrated</b> <b>blades</b> can {{be more difficult to}} sharpen using a whetstone or rotary sharpener than a non-serrated, however, they can be easily sharpened with a diamond. <b>Serrated</b> <b>blades</b> tend to stay sharper and longer than a similar straight edged blade. A serrated blade has a faster cut but a plain edge has a cleaner cut. Some prefer a serrated blade on a pocket knife.|$|E

50|$|A <b>serrated</b> <b>blade</b> has {{a cutting}} edge. By having less contact area than a smooth blade, the applied {{pressure}} at each {{point of contact}} is relatively greater and the points of contact are at a sharper angle to the material being cut. This causes a cutting action that involves many small splits in {{the surface of the}} material being cut, which cumulatively serve to cut the material along the line of the blade.|$|R
5000|$|The growing tip is open, fluffy, with a {{slightly}} reddish tinge. The whitish young leaves are also hairy. The medium to large leaves are lobed and strongly sinuate. The petiole sinus is U-shaped. The <b>serrated</b> <b>blade</b> is sharp. In autumn, the leaves change colour orange to deep red. The cone- or cylinder-shaped grape clusters are large. The oval berries are medium in size and the colour ranges from deep blue to violet.|$|R

50|$|An {{electric}} knife or electric carving knife is an electrical kitchen device used for slicing foods. An {{electric knife}} requires less physical effort than an ordinary knife and produces neater slices. The device {{consists of two}} <b>serrated</b> <b>blades</b> that are clipped together. When the appliance is switched on, the blades continuously move lengthways to provide the sawing action. In the UK, electric knives were popular in the 1970s and not as popular in today's kitchens.|$|E
50|$|Unlike its namesake, the gas giant planet Saturn, the Cykranosh of Smith's {{fiction has}} a {{material}} surface, a breathable atmosphere, and a topography similar to Earth with vast plains, deserts, and mountains.

5|$|The Benchmade factory {{version was}} sold under the model name BM970 or BM975 {{depending}} on blade length. Other designations followed which denoted blade finish, manual or automatic opening, or partially <b>serrated</b> <b>blade.</b> The knife retained {{the profile of}} Emerson's custom piece {{in addition to the}} ATS-34 steel and the titanium liners. However, on Benchmade's offering the titanium bolsters and micarta scales were replaced with G10 fiberglass scales, the slotted screws were replaced by Torx head screws, and the pocket clip was repositioned so that the knife could be carried in the pocket in a tip-down position.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the wake}} {{characteristics}} and the aerodynamic noise generated from a plate blade {{immersed in the}} uniform flow was measured by wind tunnel, moreover, the effect of reduction on the noise according to addition of serration was analyzed based on the prediction equation of the discrete frequency noise. The discrete frequency noise of the <b>serrated</b> plate <b>blade</b> {{on the leading edge}} became 6. 2 dB smaller than the flat plate <b>blade.</b> The <b>serrated</b> plate <b>blade</b> reduced the velocity gradient to the main flow direction in the wake than that of the flat plate blade. It is considered that the strength of the velocity fluctuation at vicinity of the trailing edge of the <b>serrated</b> plate <b>blade</b> became small because of the slow of the velocity gradient. From analysis on the wake characteristics, since it is not only reducing the scale of the wake vortex but also diminishing the potential of the vortex, it clarified that to add of the serration to the leading edge on the plate blade is effective...|$|R

50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Iron Age hundreds of region-specific variants of the sickle have evolved, initially of iron and later steel. This great diversity of sickle types across many cultures can be divided into smooth or <b>serrated</b> <b>blades,</b> both of which can be used for cutting either green grass or mature cereals using slightly different techniques. The serrated blade that originated in prehistoric sickles still dominates in the reaping of grain and is even found in modern grain-harvesting machines and in some kitchen knives.|$|E
5000|$|Crash axe A short {{lightweight}} handheld emergency chopping tool {{with a sharp}} or <b>serrated</b> <b>blade</b> spanning {{a quarter}} circular from the axis of the handle, sometimes with a notch in the blade to catch on sheet metal, and often a short pick opposite the blade, this tool or a prybar is required to be carried in most large aircraft cockpits with 20 seats or more to quickly chop and pry walls and cabinets to gain access when extinguishing a fire while in flight or to escape when exits are unavailable. A crash axe is sometimes also used by crash rescue firefighter crews to chop through the airplane's sheet metal skin for a rescue opening; modern crash axes are often made with an electrically insulated handle.|$|R
5000|$|In kitchen usage, {{a utility}} knife is between a chef's knife and paring knife in size, about 10 cm and 18 cm (4 and 7 inches) in length. The utility knife has {{declined}} in popularity, {{and is at}} times derided as filler for knife sets[...] This decline is attributed to the knife being : compared to a chef's knife, it is too short for many food items, has insufficient clearance when used at a cutting board, and is too fragile for heavier cutting tasks, while compared to a paring knife, which is used when cutting between one's hands, (e.g., carving a radish), the added length offers no benefit and indeed makes control harder in these fine tasks.
