25|$|In 2006 {{research}} {{about the impact}} of <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> from wind turbines on nearby population, perceived infrasound has been associated to effects such as annoyance or fatigue, depending on its intensity, with little evidence supporting physiological effects of infrasound below the human perception threshold. Later studies, however, have linked inaudible infrasound to effects such as fullness, pressure or tinnitus, and acknowledged the possibility that it could disturb sleep. Other studies have also suggested associations between noise levels in turbines and self-reported sleep disturbances in the nearby population, while adding that the contribution of infrasound to this effect is still not fully understood.|$|E

40|$|The {{hardenability}} {{of steel}} {{through the whole}} workpiece depends on several facts: chemical composition, the type of steel, {{the size and shape}} representing the mass of the workpiece, microstructure prior to heat treatment, the type of quenching medium applied, the quenching method and the quenching process itself. Most common difficulties encountered are caused by deviations due to a vapour film formation around the workpiece. The vapour film formed around the workpiece produces an uneven removal of heat and consequently, a different microstructure than the one expected. In order to control the hardening process, one should be able to monitor the quenching process in real time. The paper treats an experimental setup comprising detection of <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> together with some results obtained in the course of quenching. Due to heat transfer from a specimen to a quenching medium, film boiling and nucleate boiling occur around a heated specimen, which strongly affects sound-pressure signals emitted from the surface during quenching. Different amplitudes of emitted sound-pressure signals at different frequencies therefore mostly depend on the wetting behaviour around the surface of the specimen. It has turned out that an analysis of <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> signals can provide useful information that confirms differences occurring in quenching specimens with different shapes in different quenching media under different quenching conditions.

50|$|Plants emit audio {{acoustic}} emissions between 10-240 Hz {{as well as}} ultrasonic acoustic emissions (UAE) within 20-300 kHz. Evidence {{for plant}} mechanosensory abilities are shown when roots are subjected to unidirectional 220 Hz sound and subsequently grow {{in the direction of}} the vibration source. Using electrograph vibrational detection, structured sound wave emissions were detected along the elongation zone of root tips of corn plants in the form of loud and frequent clicks. When plants are isolated from contact, chemical, and light signal exchange with neighboring plants they are still able to sense their neighbors and detect relatives through alternative mechanisms, among which sound vibrations could play an important role. Furthermore, ultrasonic acoustic emissions (UAE) have been detected in a range of different plants which result from collapsing water columns under high tension. UAE studies show different frequencies of <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> based on whether or not drought conditions are present. Whether or not UAE are used by plants as a communication mechanism is not known. Although the explicit mechanisms through which <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> are created and detected in plants are not known, there are theories which shed light on possible mechanisms. Mechanical vibrations caused by charged cell membranes and walls is a leading hypothesis for acoustic emission generation. Myosins and other mechanochemical enzymes which use chemical energy in the form of ATP to produce mechanical vibrations in cells may also contribute to sound wave generation in plant cells. These mechanisms may lead to overall nanomechanical oscillations of cytoskeletal components, which can generate both low and high frequency vibrations.|$|E

Measured <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> by plants as well as differential germination rates, growth rates and behavioral modifications in response to sound are well documented. Plants detect neighbors by means other than well-established communicative signals including volatile chemicals, light detection, direct contact and root signaling. Because sound waves travel efficiently through soil and can be produced with minimal energy expenditure, plants may use sound {{as a means for}} interpreting their environment and surroundings. Preliminary evidence supports that plants create sound in root tips when cell walls break. Because plant roots respond only to sound waves at frequencies which match waves emitted by the plants themselves, it is likely that plants can receive and transduce sound vibrations into signals to elicit behavioral modifications as a form of below ground communication.|$|E
