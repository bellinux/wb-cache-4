40|$|Preeclampsia is {{a severe}} {{complication}} of pregnancy, characterized by hypertension, oxidative stress, and severe endothelial dysfunction. Antiangiogenic factors, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase- 1 (sFlt- 1) and soluble endoglin, play key pathophysiological roles in preeclampsia. Heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) is a cytoprotective, antioxidant enzyme {{reported to be}} downregulated in preeclampsia. Studies propose that inducing HO- 1 may also decrease sFlt- 1 production. <b>Sofalcone,</b> a gastric antiulcer agent in clinical use, is known to induce HO- 1 in gastric epithelium. We aimed to investigate whether <b>sofalcone</b> induces HO- 1 and reduces sFlt- 1 release from primary human placental and endothelial cells and blocks endothelial dysfunction in vitro. We isolated human trophoblasts and endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and also used uterine microvascular cells. We investigated the effects of <b>sofalcone</b> on (1) HO- 1 production, (2) activation of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2 pathway, (3) sFlt- 1 and soluble endoglin release, (4) tumor necrosis factor α-induced monocyte adhesion and vascular cell adhesion molecule upregulation, and (5) endothelial tubule formation. <b>Sofalcone</b> potently increased HO- 1 mRNA and protein in both primary trophoblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Furthermore, <b>sofalcone</b> treatment caused nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2 and transactivation of other nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2 responsive genes (NQO 1, TXN, and GCLC). Importantly, <b>sofalcone</b> significantly decreased the secretion of sFlt- 1 from primary human trophoblasts. <b>Sofalcone</b> potently suppressed endothelial dysfunction in 2 in vitro models, blocking tumor necrosis factor α-induced monocyte adhesion and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These results indicate that in primary human tissues, <b>sofalcone</b> can potently activate antioxidant nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2 /HO- 1 pathway, decrease sFlt- 1 production, and ameliorate endothelial dysfunction. We propose that <b>sofalcone</b> is a novel therapeutic candidate for preeclampsia. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} and selective method for quantitation of <b>sofalcone</b> and its active metabolite in human plasma {{has been established}} using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/ MS/MS). Plasma samples were transferred into 96 -well plate using an automated sample handling system and spiked with 10 µL of 2 µg/mL d 3 -sofalcone and d 3 -sofalcone metabolite solutions (internal standard), respectively. After adding 0. 5 mL of acetonitrile to the 96 -well plate, the plasma samples were then vortexed for 30 sec. After centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred into another 96 -well plate and completely evaporated at 40 o C under a stream of nitrogen. Dry residues were reconstituted with mobile phase and were injected into a C 18 reversed-phase column. The limit of quantitation of <b>sofalcone</b> and its metabolite was 2 ng/ mL, using a sample volume of 0. 2 mL for analysis. The reproducibility of the method was evaluated by analyzing 10 replicates over the concentration range of 2 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL. The validation experiments of the method {{have shown that the}} assay has good precision and accuracy. <b>Sofalcone</b> and its metabolite produced a protonated precursor ion ([M+H]) of m/z 451 and 453, and a corresponding product ion of m/z 315 and 317, respectively.

40|$|Recently, some antiulcer {{agents have}} been {{reported}} to have antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori, which is highly associated with gastritis and peptic ulcers. In-vitro and in-vivo activity of plaunotol, a cytoprotective antiulcer agent, against H. pylori was investigated. Antibacterial activity of plaunotol against a standard strain (NCTC 11637) and 14 clinical isolates was compared with those of other cytoprotective antiulcer agents: benexate, <b>sofalcone,</b> teprenone, cetraxate, and gefarnate, by an agar dilution method. The MIC » and MIC » of plaunotol against 15 strains were 6. 25 and 12. 5 mg/L, respectively, making it the most potent of the cytoprotective antiulcer agents. The bactericidal effect of plaunotol was investigated using an in-vitro killing assay. Plaunotol at concentrations of more than 6 mg/L induced a rapid reduction of culture turbidity, with an extensive loss of viability, within 30 min. Observation by scanning electron microscopy revealed that plaunotol caused autolysis and treated cells were deformed. In-vivo activity of plaunotol against H. pylori was examined in a nude mouse gastritis model. Plaunotol significantly decreased the number of H. pylori in the stomach of nude mice. In addition, the antiulcer agent enhanced the antibacterial activity of amoxycillin or clarithromycin in the infection model...|$|E
