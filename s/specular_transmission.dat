The influence of an interface on the spontaneous emission has been known for many years. Here, we study the influence on the extinction cross-section and absorption cross-section. We provide a detailed analysis of interference and near-field effects. We show that the presence of a Rayleigh scatterer may enhance the specular reflection or <b>specular</b> <b>transmission</b> under certain conditions.

40|$|Interface {{roughness}} {{effects on}} electron transmission in tunnel junctions are investigated theoretically in {{the limit of}} thick barriers. The barrier roughness is described in terms of self-affine fractal scaling by the roughness exponent H, rms roughness amplitude w, and correlation length ξ. For realistic parameters diffuse transmission usually exceeds <b>specular</b> <b>transmission.</b> It is shown that for small roughness exponents (H< 0. 5) the transmission coefficient increases with decreasing ratio w/ξ. For large roughness exponents (or smoother interfaces at short wavelengths) the transmission coefficient has a maximum at a certain value of the ratio w/ξ. With increasing w/ξ the tunneling current behaves similarly as the transmission coefficient. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{theories}} of electron tunneling between metallic layers, one fundamental question remains: {{which is the}} relevant density of states which determines the tunnel current through the barrier? In this letter, the influence of electron scattering at the metal/oxide interface in magnetic tunnel junctions on the tunnel current is addressed from a theoretical point of view. Two contributions to the tunnel current and to the magnetoresistance of these junctions are obtained: one from <b>specular</b> <b>transmission</b> through the barrier which {{is related to the}} one-dimensional density of states next to the metal/oxide interface, the other from tunneling assisted by interfacial scattering which depends both on the one-dimensional and three-dimensional density of states. The effect of spin-flip scattering on the impurities is discussed as well...|$|E

40|$|PowerWindow, a {{built-in}} Luminescent Solar Concentrator (LSC), {{is composed of}} a window glass with thulium doped coating and a CIGS PV-cell strip attached to one glass edge. LSCs can absorb part of the incoming sunlight and re-direct it to the edges, where PV-cells can produce electricity. Light transport efficiency is then determined by several characteristics of the glass waveguide and thulium as luminescent particles. The main objectives of this work were {{to find the most}} relevant characteristics of a LSC affecting its optical efficiency, and to optimize such parameters for a high performance. In {{the first part of this}} work, LightTools, a ray-tracing software, was tested to model a LSC based on red-dyes. Simulation results were compared with experimental measurements using a sample of PMMA doped with red-dye (Lumogen F 305). The optical efficiency of the red-dye model was 4. 1 %, and LSC sample had 4. 5 % of efficiency (measured in a previous thesis work [Overbeek, 2015]), meaning 0. 4 % of marginal error. Optical losses were identified and quantified; from them, <b>specular</b> <b>transmission</b> resulted in 25. 5 % losses, and 0. 1 % error compared to measurements. In this respect, LightTools was proven to be a useful tool for modelling LSCs and quantify accurately the optical efficiency. With these results, the ray-tracing method proposed was extended for thulium based LSCs. Two thulium LSC models were simulated in LightTools: A glass doped with thulium particles (model 1), and pure glass with thulium coating (model 2, PowerWindow design). From the tested variables, the mean free path (MFP) length, related to the luminophore concentration, is one of the main parameters affecting the optical efficiency and transmission losses. Moreover, the MFP ratio showed high relevance in the optical efficiency since it describes how large is the path length for photons in the emission range compared to blue (absorbed) photons. In both models, it was shown that large MFP ratio (ℛ = 10), high quantum yield (QY= 1), small area (25 cm²), and 5 mm of glass thickness provide optimum results. With these parameters, the optical efficiency of model 1 was 11 %, and model 2 about 13 %. However, a large scale model 2 of 1 m² had maximum optical efficiency below 1 % with light transmission above 80 %, and concentration factor of 1. Considering the optical efficiency of this large scale LSC model, and high performance CIGS PV-cells, the energy yield was estimated as only 1. 4 kWh per year in the Netherlands. LSC performance might be improved by adding thin film layers in the glass, such as anti-reflection coating and selective filters to allow visible light and reflect NIR photons into the glass.

For these, <b>specular</b> reflection and <b>transmission</b> show increased optical scattering with increasing thickness. To test if the surface roughness can be determined by optical means for the variety in the roughness values, we apply optical scattering theory to calculate the root-mean-square surface roughness from specular reflection data.

We also find an enhanced optical absorption coefficient for the thicker samples which may be beneficial for photovoltaic applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{acoustic}} mismatch {{model and}} the diffuse mismatch model {{have been widely used}} to predict the thermal interface conductance. However, the acoustic mismatch model (diffuse mismatch model) is based on the hypothesis of a perfectly smooth (completely disordered) interface.

By taking partially specular and partially diffuse transmissions into account, the mixed mismatch model can predict the thermal interface conductance with arbitrary roughness. The proportions of <b>specular</b> and diffuse <b>transmission</b> are determined by the interface roughness which is described by the interfacial density of states.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a physically-based Monte Carlo technique for approximating bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) {{for a large}} class of geometries by directly simulating geometric optical scattering from surfaces. The method is more general than previous analytical models: it removes most restrictions on surface microgeometry. Three main points are described: a new representation of the BRDF, a Monte Carlo technique to estimate the coefficients of the representation, and the means of creating a milliscale BRDF from microscale scattering events. The combination of these techniques allows the pre-diction of scattering from essentially arbitrary roughness geometries. The BRDF is concisely represented by a matrix of spherical harmonic coefficients; the matrix is directly estimated from a geometric optics simulation, enforcing exact reciprocity. Microscale scattering events are represented by direct simulation (e. g., <b>specular</b> reflection and <b>transmission</b> by individual textile fibers) or by a microscale-averaged model (e. g., a wave-optics-based statistical BRDF) depend...|$|R

Electrodynamic Shields (EDS) have been targeted as a technology to help mitigate degradation of power output caused by dust deposition on various solar collectors. Though printed circuit board based EDS prototypes have shown promising dust removal efficiencies, an inexpensive method of transparent EDS fabrication must be realized before the EDS technology is adopted by the solar industry. Development of a screen-printing process is presented as a scalable, low-cost method of EDS fabrication. The process is established using a silver-based ink on borosilicate glass substrates and then adapted to incorporate transparent conductive PEDOT:PSS and ITO nanoparticle solutions. Successful EDS prototypes are characterized and integrated with photovoltaic cells and second surface mirrored substrates. Removal efficiencies of the screen-printed EDS are tested by measuring the restoration in <b>specular</b> reflection and <b>transmission</b> in integrated EDS-mirror and EDSPV modules after dust depositions. Finally, a cost analysis of the EDS screen-printing process is performed in order to predict the economic viability of the EDS technology when used in conjunction with solar collecting technologies. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|R

Even though three-dimensional Photonic Crystals (PCs), made of high index materials such as titanium dioxide 1, 2 and silicon 3, have been fabricated for instance by successive sputtering and electron beam patterning or from opal templates 4 – 6, the infiltration of a lithographically structured polymer template appears to be a particularly effective strategy for obtaining large three dimensional PCs 7, 8 and for embedding functional subunits for application in optical circuits or devices 9 – 11. Tétreault et al. reported the first silicon replica of such a woodpile template using the silicon double inversion technique 12. A SiO 2 inverse woodpile PC was used as an intermediate structure that was subsequently infiltrated with silicon by employing high temperature chemical vapor deposi-tion (CVD). Later, the same group reported on the fabrication of silicon inverse woodpile PCs 7. In this case, a SiO 2 shell was deposited around the polymer rods of the template to preserve the log-pile structure during the silicon deposition process. By these and related approaches, silicon hollow-rod woodpile PCs 13, waveguides 11, hyperunifrom 14 and complete band gap PCs at telecommunication wavelengths around 1. 54 μm 8 have been obtained. Another well-known high refractive index material that has been widely used in the past is titania (TiO 2, titanium dioxide) 1, 6, 15. The advantages of titania, compared to silicon, are its transparency in the visible to mid-infrared region as well as the possibility to chemically wet-process. In addition, titania can be deposited at moderate temperatures around or below 100 °C. This makes titania a particularly well-suited material to infiltrate three-dimensional polymeric scaffolds directly without the need for any additional infiltration steps which tend to lead to structural deterioration. In this work we present the fabrication, structural and optical characterization of titania hollow-channel and inverse woodpile PCs. Our work reports two main achievements in the field. First, we report on the fabrication of high-index woodpile PCs in a single infiltration step process. This facilitates, as we will show, the fabricatio...|$|R
