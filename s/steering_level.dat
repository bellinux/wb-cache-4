40|$|Using a hydrographic climatology, global maps of meso-scale eddy {{kinetic energy}} (EKE), diffusivities for mixing along isopycnals (isopycnal diffusivity) and for the advective effect of meso-scale eddies (skew diffusivity) are created using {{properties}} {{of the fastest growing}} unstable baroclinic waves and a simple ad hoc scaling of the amplitudes from linear stability theory. Amplitudes of EKE compare well with near-surface observational estimates based on satellite data and results of an eddy-permitting model, but show a low bias in regions where eddies are not generated locally but propagate into, which will likely transfer both to the diffusivities. In agreement with previous studies we find largest diffusivities in the deep Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and in the shallow western boundary and low latitude westward currents. In agreement with analytical consideration, we find that isopycnal diffusivities are increased at the depth of the <b>steering</b> <b>level</b> where unstable waves and mean flow propagate at the same speed, while skew diffusivities exhibit less vertical dependency, and that isopycnal diffusivities are roughly three times larger than skew diffusivities at the <b>steering</b> <b>level.</b> It is shown that the vertical structure of the diffusivities can be explained to a large extent by the effect of the planetary vorticity gradient which leads to a decrease of skew diffusivities at the surface (bottom) and to a downward (upward) shift of the <b>steering</b> <b>level,</b> and thus the maximum of isopycnal diffusivities, for eastward (westward) flow.

40|$|Satellite {{altimetric}} {{observations of}} the ocean reveal surface pressure patterns {{in the core of}} the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) that propagate downstream (eastward) but slower than the mean surface current by about 25 %. The authors argue that these observations are suggestive of baroclinically unstable waves that have a <b>steering</b> <b>level</b> at a depth of about 1 km. Detailed linear stability calculations using a hydrographic atlas indeed reveal a <b>steering</b> <b>level</b> in the ACC near the depth implied by the altimetric observations. Calculations using a nonlinear model forced by the mean shear and stratification observed close to the core of the ACC, coinciding with a position where mooring data and direct eddy flux measurements are avail-able, reveal a similar picture, albeit with added details. When eddy fluxes are allowed to adjust the mean state, computed eddy kinetic energy and eddy stress are close to observed magnitudes with steering levels between 1 and 1. 5 km, broadly consistent with observations. An important result {{of this study is that}} the vertical structure of the potential vorticity (PV) eddy diffusivity is strongly depth dependent, implying that the diffusivity for PV and buoyancy are very different from one another. It is shown that the flow can simultaneously support a PV diffusivity peaking at 5000 m 2 s 21 or so near the middepth <b>steering</b> <b>level</b> and a buoyancy diffusivity that is much smaller, of order 1000 m 2 s 21, exhibiting less vertical structure. An effective diffusivity calculation, using an advected and diffused tracer transformed into area coordinates, confirms that the PV diffusivity more closely reflects the mixing properties of the flow than does the buoyancy diffusivity, and points explicitly to the need for separating tracer and buoyancy flux parameterizations in coarse-resolution general circulation models. Finally, impli-cations for the eddy-driven circulation of the ACC are discussed. 1...|$|E

40|$|Observations {{and theory}} suggest that lateral mixing by {{mesoscale}} ocean eddies only reaches its maximum potential at <b>steering</b> <b>levels,</b> surfaces {{at which the}} propagation speed of eddies approaches that of the mean flow. Away from <b>steering</b> <b>levels,</b> mixing is strongly suppressed because the mixing length is smaller than the eddy scale, thus reducing the mixing rates. The suppression is particularly pronounced in strong currents where mesoscale eddies are most energetic. Here, a framework for parameterizing eddy mixing is explored that attempts to capture this suppression. An expression of the surface eddy diffusivity proposed by Ferrari and Nikurashin is evaluated using observations of eddy kinetic energy, eddy scale, and eddy propagation speed. The resulting global maps of eddy diffusivity have a broad correspondence with recent estimates of diffusivity based on {{the rate at which}} tracer contours are stretched by altimetric-derived surface currents. Finally, the expression for the eddy diffusivity is extrapolated in the vertical to infer the eddy-induced meridional heat transport and the overturning streamfunction.

40|$|Baroclinic eddies are an {{important}} component of the General Circulation which regulate the extratropical climate by transporting heat and momentum. An idealization of this feedback is provided by baroclinic adjustment theories (Stone, 1978), which envision a linearly neutralized mean state. Based on the Charney-Stern condition, most baroclinic adjustment formulations propose basic states with homogenized potential vorticity. In this thesis we investigate the degree of potential vorticity homogenization in the extratropical troposphere. We show that homogenization is only observed across a shallow region around 700 mb, and propose an adjusted state with homogenized PV at the <b>steering</b> <b>level</b> alone. We demonstrate that this state can be neutral under certain conditions, and investigate its relevance for the equilibration of an idealized model. Because of the role of the PV flux as an eddy forcing of momentum, it is illuminating to describe the equilibration in terms of the redistribution of momentum. This affects both the PV gradient and the <b>steering</b> <b>level</b> of the waves, but the condition of homogenization at the <b>steering</b> <b>level</b> is very robust. In the 2 D problem, a local balance can be written between the dynamical and frictional forcing of momentum. However, in the 3 D problem there is an additional redistribution by a remotely forced meridional circulation. To circumvent this difficulty, we have developed a momentum-based formulation that exploits the interchangeability of momentum and temperature for quasi-balanced stratified rotating flow. By rewritting the thermodynamic equation as a momentum equation, we eliminate the forcing by the mean meridional circulation and formulate a local balance between the eddy PV flux and the non-conservative forcing of momentum. (cont.) This introduces a new variable, which we call potential momentum. The circulation can then be described in terms of the conversion between potential and physical momentum. A major simplification of this formulation is that temperature and momentum can be directly compared. For instance, the surface temperature gradient appears as a momentum source, which helps ellucidate the role of the momentum fluxes and the so-called "barotropic governor" (James, 1987) for the baroclinic equilibration. Our results suggest that mechanical friction might prevent thermal homogenization at the surface. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{potential}} vorticity diffusivity predicted by linear stability analysis (LSA), {{is the same as}} a linearized version of Lagrangian cross stream isopycnal diffusivity. Both can be written in terms of the same expression the product of the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) and the integral time scale that involves the Lagrangian decay scale gamma or the growth rate omega(i) of the most unstable wave, and a frequency that is related to the difference of the mean flow speed and real part of the phase speed of the unstable waves. Diffusivities from LSA are compared to Lagrangian isopycnal eddy diffusivities estimated from more than 700, 000 numerical particles in the Southern Ocean of an eddying model. They show different spatial dependency. LSA predicts eddy diffusivities that are enhanced at the <b>steering</b> <b>level</b> where the mean flow speed equals the phase speed of the unstable waves. In contrast, Lagrangian diffusivities exhibit no clear <b>steering</b> <b>level</b> maxima, but are instead surface intensified in many places. The differences between the Lagrangian and diffusivities from LSA can be understood because EKE predicted from LSA differs from the simulated one, and because the estimated decay scale gamma is On average about 4 times larger than the largest linear growth rate. The diagnosed Lagrangian integral time scale has maxima at the depth where the mean flow speed equals the phase speed of the most unstable wave, but the diffusivity maxima are shifted towards the surface because the simulated EKE decreases rapidly with depth. Possibilities for a simple parameterization for the diffusivity are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{taken at}} four principal latitudes in the Agulhas Current {{show that the}} watermass properties {{on either side of}} its dynamical core are significantly different. Inshore of its velocity core are found waters of predominantly Arabian Sea, Red Sea, and equatorial Indian Ocean origin, while offshore waters are generally from the Atlantic Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and the southeast Indian Ocean. For the most part, the inshore waters approach the Agulhas Current through the Mozambique Channel, while those offshore are circulated within the southern Indian Ocean subtropical gyre before joining the current. These disparate water masses remain distinct during their 1000 -km journeys along the South African continental slope, despite the convergence, extreme velocity shears, and high eddy kinetic energies found within the Agulhas Current. Both potential vorticity conservation and kinematic arguments are discussed as potential inhibitors of along-isopycnal mixing. It is concluded that a high cross-stream gradient of potential vorticity is the dominant mechanism for watermass separation near the surface, while the kinematic steering of water particles by the current is dominant at intermediate depths, where cross-stream potential vorticity is homogeneous. Hence, three lateral mixing regimes for the Agulhas Current are suggested. The surface and thermocline waters are always inhibited from mixing, by the presence of both a strong, cross-frontal potential vorticity gradient and kinematic steering. At intermediate depths mixing is inhibited by steering alone, and thus in this regime periodic mixing is expected during meander events (such as Natal pulses), when the <b>steering</b> <b>level</b> will rise and allow cross-frontal exchange. Below the <b>steering</b> <b>level</b> in the deep waters, there is a regime of free lateral mixing. The deep waters of the Agulhas Current are homogeneous in the cross-stream sense, being from the same North Atlantic source, and their salinity steadily (and rather rapidly) decreases to the north.
