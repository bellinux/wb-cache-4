6000|$|... “Not of this, sir,” <b>says</b> <b>Frank</b> very nobly, “only of {{our house}} in the country, which he hath given to us. This is my mother’s house, and Walcote is my father’s, and the Marquis of Esmond knows he hath but to give his word, and I return his to him.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Egad! it’s true,” <b>says</b> <b>Frank,</b> sipping {{his wine}} {{with the air}} of a lord. “What think you of this Lisbon—real Collares? ’Tis better than your heady port: we got it {{out of one of the}} Spanish ships that came from Vigo last year: my mother bought it at Southampton, as the ship was lying there—the Rose, Captain Hawkins.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{wish to see}} you friends--close {{and firm}} friends--and if I thought you otherwise, I should {{hesitate}} in what I am about to <b>say.</b> <b>Frank,</b> look here! Mr Nickleby, will you come on the other side?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thank you," [...] Frank said; [...] "we are {{late now}} {{and must be}} going on our way. I am very glad I {{happened}} to be here at the time;" [...] so <b>saying</b> <b>Frank</b> and Charlie proceeded {{on their way to}} Deal.|$|R

60|$|How {{the party}} at the doctor's got itself broken up, I am not {{prepared}} to <b>say.</b> <b>Frank,</b> I know, stayed and dined there, and his poor mother, who would not retire to rest till she had kissed him, and blessed him, and thanked him for all he was doing for the family, was kept waiting in her dressing-room till a very unreasonable hour of the night.|$|R
6000|$|... “Ass? That’s the retort {{delicate}} without doubt,” <b>says</b> <b>Frank.</b> “Beware of the homespun brothers, dear. If {{they come}} into the dance, you’ll see who’s an ass.

6000|$|... "Love you! That {{question}} {{you know to}} be unnecessary. Love you! Why I spend every day and every night in loving you! But, Frank, you wouldn't have me when I {{was going to be}} rich. I ought not to have you now that I am to be poor." [...] But by this time she was in his arms and he was kissing her, till, as she had said, the blood was once again running in her veins. [...] "Oh, Frank, what a tyrant you are! Did I not tell you to let poor father come into the room? You have said everything now. There cannot be another word to <b>say.</b> <b>Frank,</b> Frank, Frank! I have found it out at last.

6000|$|... "Here it is--Action of Wynendael--here you are, General," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Frank,</b> seizing hold of {{the little}} dingy paper that {{soldiers}} love to read so; and, scrambling over from our bench, he went to where the General sat, who knew him, and had seen many a time at his table his laughing, handsome face, which everybody loved who saw. The generals in their great perukes made way for him. He handed the paper over General Dohna's buff-coat to our General on the opposite side.|$|E

As we rode along from Dover, talking in French, he spoke about you, and your coming to him at Bar; he called you ‘le grand sérieux’, Don Bellianis of Greece, and I don’t know what names; mimicking your manner” (here Castlewood laughed himself)—“and he did it very well. He seems to sneer at everything. He is not like a king: somehow, Harry, I fancy you are like a king. He does not seem to think what a stake we are all playing. He would have stopped at Canterbury to run after a barmaid there, had I not implored him to come on. He hath a house at Chaillot where he used to go and bury himself for weeks away from the queen, and with all sorts of bad company,” <b>says</b> <b>Frank,</b> with a demure look; “you may smile, but I am not the wild fellow I was; no, no, I have been taught better,” says Castlewood devoutly, making a sign on his breast.|$|E
