Translocation of these lipids was inhibited by agents which affect protein and lipid intracellular transport causing <b>structural</b> and functional <b>disintegration</b> of the ER-Golgi system (monensin, brefeldin) and interfere with mitochondrial energy conservation (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone), but was not affected by colchicine which influences {{the organization of the}} cytoskeletal network. Colchicine treatment resulted in marked stimulation of PQ and UQ synthesis. Results of experiments with pre-exposure of etiolated seedlings to light suggest that translocation processes are dependent on the plastid developmental state and their capacity as acceptors of PQ. Thus, the experiments indicate that biosynthesis and transport of PQ and UQ involve multiple cellular compartments and that kinetics of the transport process is dependent on the actual physiological conditions...|$|R

While the abundance of coral has declined in recent decades [2, 3], the implications for humanity are difficult to quantify because they depend on ecosystem function rather than the corals themselves. Most reef functions and ecosystem services are founded {{on the ability of}} reefs to maintain their three-dimensional structure through net carbonate accumulation [4]. Coral growth only constitutes part of a reef’s carbonate budget; bioerosion processes are influential in determining the balance between net <b>structural</b> growth and <b>disintegration</b> [5, 6]. Here, we combine ecological models with carbonate budgets and drive the dynamics of Caribbean reefs with the latest generation of climate models. Budget reconstructions using documented ecological perturbations drive shallow (6 – 10 m) Caribbean forereefs toward an increasingly fragile carbonate balance. We then projected carbonate budgets toward 2080 and contrasted the benefits of local conservation and global action on climate change. Local management of fisheries (specifically, no-take marine reserves) and the watershed can delay reef loss by at least a decade under “business-as-usual” rises in greenhouse gas emissions. However, local action must be combined with a low-carbon economy to prevent degradation of reef structures and associated ecosystem services...|$|R

Partly they are caused by overweight and obesity. Diet is an important modifiable determinant for these risk factors and understanding how food characteristics, e. g. composition and structure, influence appetite and metabolic responses might aid {{in the development of}} healthy foods. In this thesis I examined how formulation, processing techniques (baking, cooking, extrusion) and process parameters affect rye, oat and wheat food characteristics (including structure and dietary fibre composition) and the implications of this for appetite and metabolic responses in humans. In vitro digestion methods were used to study <b>structural</b> changes, gastric <b>disintegration,</b> digesta viscosity and glucose release. In human trials, the effect of aeration method (fermentation or whipping) in rye crispbread production on appetite and metabolic responses was evaluated. When inulin was added to rye porridge, available water was reduced, decreasing starch gelatinisation and viscosity, changes with potentially counteracting effects on glucose response in humans. Smaller oat bran particles in bread increased degradation of β-glucan during fermentation, but also increased their solubility, events with opposing effects on digesta viscosity. Increased viscosity is an underlying mechanism for the ability of β-glucans, and certain other dietary fibres, to lower glucose response and total blood cholesterol. In fermented rye crispbread viscous fibres were more degraded and postprandial insulin response higher when compared with unfermented rye crispbread. However, the effect could also be attributed to slower gastric disintegration for the unfermented rye crispbread. Choice of aeration method had no observable impact on appetite. An amylose layer surrounding starch granules was observed only in sourdough-fermented soft rye bread. This seemed to inhibit glucose release, despite degraded viscous dietary fibres and rapid gastric disintegration. To conclude, processing and formulation were found to generally affect more than one food characteristic, which might be of relevance for a specific metabolic response. The net effect of characteristics associated with a targeted metabolic response should be considered when designing or selecting foods intended to promote health...|$|R

These biomarkers fall into two molecular categories: biomarkers of amyloid-beta (A?) deposition and plaque formation as well as of tau-protein related hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration. Three of the six gold-standard ("core feasible) biomarkers are neuroimaging measures and three are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes. CSF A? 1 - 42 (A? 1 - 42), also expressed as A? 1 - 42 : A? 1 - 40 ratio, T-tau, and P-tau Thr 181 & Thr 231 proteins have proven diagnostic accuracy and risk enhancement in prodromal MCI and AD dementia. Conversely, having all three biomarkers in the normal range rules out AD. Intermediate conditions require further patient follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at increasing field strength and resolution allows detecting the evolution of distinct types of structural and functional abnormality pattern throughout early to late AD stages.

The use of molecular in vivo amyloid imaging agents (the fifth validated biomarker), such as the Pittsburgh Compound-B and markers of neurodegeneration, such as fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) (as the sixth validated biomarker) support the detection of early AD pathological processes and associated neurodegeneration. How to use, interpret, and disclose biomarker results drives the need for optimized standardization. Multimodal AD biomarkers do not evolve in an identical manner but rather in a sequential but temporally overlapping fashion. Models of the temporal evolution of AD biomarkers can take the form of plots of biomarker severity (degree of abnormality) versus time. AD biomarkers can be combined to increase accuracy or risk.

30|$|Although the UPP is {{activated}} during CMV, experimental inhibition of this proteolytic system {{has only been}} partially effective in preventing diaphragm muscle dysfunction [5, 21]. An explanation for this limited success is that other proteolytic systems act upstream of the UPP. Calpains are known to cleave myofilaments from the sarcomeric lattice [22] and thereby enable the UPP to degrade muscle protein into small peptides [23]. Immunolocalization studies showed that the calpains are concentrated in the Z-disk and I-band areas of the myofibril [22]. The Z-disk acts as anchor and mechanically links thin filaments from one sarcomere to the next along the myofibril [24]. One calpain substrate is the giant sarcomeric protein titin, which contains high-affinity calpain binding sites where the protein can be cleaved [25, 26]. Ex vivo experiments have shown that treatment of myofibrils from normal muscle with μ-calpain or m-calpain closely mimic <b>structural</b> <b>disintegration</b> as observed in rapidly atrophying [11, 22].|$|E

The study examined the characteristic structures of magnesite-chrome, chrome-magnesite and magnesite refractories exposed to SO 2 -O 2 gas mixture at temperatures of 700 °C to 1350 °C. The phase characterization was conducted with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The {{results show that the}} physical characteristics of the refractory matrix along the grain boundaries are important refractory features during chemical attack from SO 2 -containing gas. Upon heating in SO 2 -containing gas, the changes in phase-chemical compositions and accompanying grain growth causes loosening of the structure and the pore volume promotes gas diffusion. The chemical reactions that occur form stable sulfate compounds identified as MgSO 4, CaSO 4 and CaMg 3 (SO 4) 4, and lead to disintegration of various phase structures and consequently erosion of the refractory. In conclusion, the reaction mechanisms in MgO-MgR 2 O 3 refractories exposed to SO 2 -containing gases progress through a combination of <b>structural</b> <b>disintegration</b> and chemical attack...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTitin {{is a giant}} {{filamentous}} protein of {{the muscle}} sarcomere in which stretch induces the unfolding of its globular domains. However, the mechanisms of how domains are progressively selected for unfolding and which domains eventually unfold have for long been elusive. Based on force-clamp optical tweezers experiments we report here that, in a paradoxical violation of mechanically driven activation kinetics, neither the global domain unfolding rate, nor the folded-state lifetime distributions of full-length titin are sensitive to force. This paradox is reconciled by a gradient of mechanical stability so that domains are gradually selected for unfolding as {{the magnitude of the}} force field increases. Atomic force microscopic screening of extended titin molecules revealed that the unfolded domains are distributed homogenously along the entire length of titin, and this homogeneity is maintained with increasing overstretch. Although the unfolding of domains with progressively increasing mechanical stability makes titin a variable viscosity damper, the spatially randomized variation of domain stability ensures that the induced structural changes are not localized but are distributed along the molecule's length. Titin may thereby provide complex safety mechanims for protecting the sarcomere against <b>structural</b> <b>disintegration</b> under excessive mechanical conditions...|$|E

After preincubation of E. coli with intact granulocytes for 15 min, when 95 % {{or more of the}} bacteria can no longer multiply, induction of β-galactosidase proceeds at rates about half of control values. With disrupted granulocytes, which kill E. coli as rapidly as intact cells, the rate of induction of β-galactosidase does not fall until after 30 min of preincubation. We attribute the different effects of phagocytosis on the biochemical apparatus of these microorganisms to the different fates of their envelopes. Specifically labeled protein, ribonucleic acid, deoxyribonucleic acid, and lipid of all three species of bacteria and peptidoglycan of E. coli are apparently incompletely degraded during phagocytosis. However, the cell walls of M. lysodeikticus and B. megaterium undergo rapid and almost complete degradation. The resulting <b>structural</b> <b>disintegration</b> of these gram-positive microorganisms must cause extensive biochemical disorganization as well. Our evidence indicates that the E. coli envelope, on the other hand, retains sufficient structural organization to preserve integrated biochemical function for at least 1 h after the bacteria have lost the ability to multiply...|$|E

Although, various strategies were adopted but still results are far from required values for their practical usage. Here, we have designed a unique structure to prevent surface reaction and <b>structural</b> <b>disintegration</b> meanwhile intrinsic conductivity is improved to involve all redox sites in conversion reaction. CoSnx@C-PAn hybrid was synthesized through aqueous chemical route, Co doping in tin make accessible all redox sites by faster conduction of electrons while its hard nature relaxes internal stress, carbon shell prevents surface reaction and brings well control on solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film by maintaining barrier between electrode surface and electrolyte and nitrogen doped porous carbon provides faster diffusion of Li+ deep in electrode make possible high mass loadings and conduction highway for electrons. Furthermore, porous carbon also provides room to compensate volume expansion and keeps electrode structure stable. Because of its unique structure hybrid shows excellent reversible capacity of 2044 mAh/g (retention 100 %) with mass loading of 3. 8 mg/cm 2 along with long cyclic life up to 1000 cycles and bears high rate capability (20 A/g).

40|$|The {{structural}} {{properties of}} ethyl cellulose and propylene glycol dicaprylate mixtures were investigated {{with a view}} to facilitating use of the system as excepient for topical drug delivery. The working protocol included small-deformation dynamic oscillation in combination with the principle of time-temperature superposition, micro and modulated differential scanning calorimetry, wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectroscopy, and optical profile analysis in the form of gel particle roughness. In contrast to thermoreversible gelation upon heating of aqueous ethyl cellulose solutions reported widely in the literature, replacing water with propylene glycol dicaprylate and mixing with the polymer yields gels that revert to the solution state with increasing temperature. Time effects were also probed; the continuous increase in viscoelasticity of preparations as a function of time of observation at ambient temperature was accompanied by <b>structural</b> <b>disintegration</b> of the polymeric particles. This was rationalized by proposing that specific polymer-solvent interactions result with aging in particle erosion and the release of polymeric strands that are able to form a three-dimensional structure. It was thus documented that the time-temperature equivalence was active in the system producing a rubbery state in the master curve of viscoelasticity, which extends from ambient to subzero temperatures and should facilitate pharmaceutical applications...|$|E
40|$|A S {{part of an}} {{investigation}} of the possible functions of bacteria in the development of chronic marginal gingivitis and periodontal disease, we have reported the production of hyaluronidase and beta-glucuronidasel and phenolsulfatase 2 by gingival microorganisms. In addition to hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate is among the components of gingival tissue, 3 4 forming a part of the intercellular "cementing " substances. It was, therefore, pertinent {{to determine whether or not}} gingival microorganisms produce an enzyme, capable of catalyzing the breakdown of this substance, by means of which they might contribute to the <b>structural</b> <b>disintegration</b> of the gingivae. The enzyme, chondrosulfatase (chondroitin sulfatase, chondroitinase) 5, 6 catalyzes the hydrolysis of the mueopolysaccharide, chondroitin sulfate. Neu-berg and Rubin 7 established in 1914 that inorganic sulfate is formed from chondroitin sulfate by putrefactive bacteria. Later reports have shown that some strains of Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a micro-organism related to Pseudomonas eisenbergii produce chondrosulfatase. An indication of the presence of chondrosulfatase in cell-free extracts of gingival accumulations has been reported previously. 8 The present paper describes the production of this enzyme by bacteria isolated from gingival crevices and pockets. MATERIALS AND METHODS Beef-extract broth: Preliminary trials showed that the broth used for the bacterial production of phenolsulfatase was satisfactory also for the production of chondrosulfatase. The following recipe was used...|$|E
40|$|Polymeric {{micelles}} with {{a controlled}} {{size in the}} range between 41 and 80 nm were prepared by injecting the organic phase through a microengineered nickel membrane or a tapered-end glass capillary into an aqueous phase. The organic phase was composed of 1 mg mL 1 of PEG-b-PCL diblock copolymers with variable molecular weights, dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) or acetone. The pore size of the membrane was 20 m and the aqueous/organic phase volumetric flow rate ratio ranged from 1. 5 to 10. Block copolymers were successfully synthesized withMn ranging from 9700 to 16, 000 g mol 1 and polymeric micelles were successfully produced from both devices. Micelles produced from the membrane device were smaller than those produced from the microfluidic device, due to the much smaller pore size compared with the orifice size in a co-flow device. The micelles {{were found to be}} relatively stable in terms of their size with an initial decrease in size attributed to evaporation of residual solvent rather than their <b>structural</b> <b>disintegration.</b> Fluconazole was loaded into the cores of micelles by injecting the organic phase composed of 0. 5 – 2. 5 mg mL 1 fluconazole and 1. 5 mg mL 1 copolymer. The size of the drug-loaded micelles was found to be significantly larger than the size of empty micelles...|$|E
40|$|Low-density, highly porous graphene/graphene oxide (GO) based-foams {{have shown}} high {{performance}} in energy absorption applications, even under high compressive deformations. In general, foams are very effective as energy dissipative materials {{and have been}} widely used in many areas such as automotive, aerospace and biomedical industries. In the case of graphene-based foams, the good mechanical properties are mainly attributed to the intrinsic graphene and/or GO electronic and mechanical properties. Despite the attractive physical properties of graphene/GO based-foams, their structural and thermal stabilities are still a problem for some applications. For instance, they are easily degraded when placed in flowing solutions, either by the collapsing of their layers or just by <b>structural</b> <b>disintegration</b> into small pieces. Recently, a new and scalable synthetic approach to produce low-density 3 D macroscopic GO structure interconnected with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymeric chains (pGO) was proposed. A controlled amount of PDMS is infused into the freeze-dried foam resulting into a very rigid structure with improved mechanical properties, such as tensile plasticity and toughness. The PDMS wets the graphene oxide sheets and acts like a glue bonding PDMS and GO sheets. In order to obtain further insights on mechanisms behind the enhanced mechanical pGO response we carried out fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Based on MD results, we build up a structural model that can explain the experimentally observed mechanical behavior...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Disintegration of rye {{and wheat}} breads during in vitro gastric {{digestion}} {{and its relation}} to the postprandial glucose and insulin responses of the breads was studied. Breads with distinct composition and texture characteristics were prepared with refined or wholegrain wheat and rye flour by using either straight dough or sourdough process. After chewing and gastric digestion in vitro, 100 % wholemeal and refined rye breads prepared by sourdough method were disintegrated to a much lower extent than the wheat breads, having more bread digesta particles with size over 2 or 3 mm. Microstructure of the digesta particles of rye sourdough bread revealed more aggregated and less degraded starch granules when compared to refined wheat bread. The postprandial insulin responses, but not those of glucose, to the 100 % rye breads made with sourdough method were lower than the responses to the refined wheat bread. Addition of gluten or bran in rye sourdough bread increased insulin response. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) analysis confirmed that the insulin response had a negative correlation with the number of larger particles after in vitro digestion as well as amount of soluble fiber and sourdough process. Since the high relative proportion of large sized particles after chewing and in vitro gastric digestion was associated with low postprandial insulin responses, the analysis of <b>structural</b> <b>disintegration</b> in vitro is proposed as a complementary tool i...|$|E
40|$|As a gene-driven mode of cell death, {{apoptosis}} has {{a significant}} role in eliminating unwanted cells during normal embryonic development and adult homeostasis. Its dysregulation leads to many diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disease. Its modulation, either by increasing it or decreasing it, has the potential to resolve issues relating to the pathogenesis of many diseases. For each role, accurate quantification of apoptosis is crucial for defining its roles and the benefits of its modulation. The structural features of apoptosis that include the characteristic nuclear morphology and the condensation of the cell into discrete membrane-bound apoptotic bodies are all considered late-stage apoptosis. Nonetheless, these are what we see through a microscope, without use of special molecular markers, and are most oft en used for quantification of the process. The molecular and biochemical pathways that lead to the regulated <b>structural</b> <b>disintegration</b> of the cell in apoptosis give an indication of the earlier stages of the process, including those that may be targeted for therapies. Not all of these known molecular changes, however, always lead to apoptotic death of cells; many of the molecular and biochemical changes can occur without processing of apoptosis, and some can be related to inflammation as much as to cell death. This chapter provides an overview of best practice for quantification of apoptosis, using a mix of morphological, biochemical and molecular techniques...|$|E
