The former names of <b>standard</b> <b>quality</b> (SQ), high quality (HQ), and high definition (HD) have been replaced by numerical values representing the vertical resolution of the video. The default video stream is encoded in the VP9 format with stereo Opus audio; if VP9/WebM is not supported in the browser/device or the browser's user agent reports Windows XP, then H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video with stereo AAC audio is used instead.|$|E

If ex ante quality of foreign firms is lower (higher) than the quality of exporting firms, a mild minimum <b>quality</b> <b>standard</b> in the home market hinders (supports) exports. The minimum <b>quality</b> <b>standard</b> increases <b>quality</b> in both markets. A welfare maximizing minimum <b>quality</b> <b>standard</b> is always lower under trade than under autarky.

However, amate paper has been made as a commodity only since the 1960s. Prior to that time, it was made for mostly ritual purposes. The success of amate paper has been as the base for the creation of other products based both in traditional Mexican handcraft designs and more modern uses. Because of the product's versatility, both Otomi artisans and others have developed a number of variations to satisfy the tastes a various handcraft consumers. [...] The paper is sold plain, dyed in a variety of colors and decorated with items such as dried leaves and flowers. [...] Although the Nahua people of Guerrero remain the principle buyers of Otomi paper, other wholesale buyers [...] have used it to create products such as lampshades, notebooks, [...] furniture covers, wallpaper, fancy stationery and [...] more. [...] The Otomi themselves have innovated by creating paper products such as envelopes, book separators, invitation cards as well as cut out figures mostly based on traditional ritual designs. The Otomi have also established two categories of paper, <b>standard</b> <b>quality</b> and that produced for the high-end market, geared to well known Nahua artists and other artists that prize the paper's qualities. This is leading to a number of paper makers to be individually recognized like master craftsmen in other fields.|$|E

Persons may then, if they choose, make [...] their contracts for future payments {{in terms of this}} multiple or [...] tabular standard.”(225) A, who had borrowed $1,000 of B in 1870 [...] for ten years, would make note of the total money value of all [...] these articles composing the multiple standard, which we will [...] suppose is $125 in 1870. Consequently, A would promise to pay B [...] eight multiple units in ten years (that is, eight times $125, or [...] $1,000). But, if other things change in value relatively to money [...] during these ten years, the same sum of money—$1,000—in 1880 will [...] not return to B the same just amount of purchasing power which he [...] parted with in 1870. Now, if, in 1880, when his note falls due, [...] the government list is examined, and it is found that commodities [...] in general have fallen in value relatively to gold, the multiple [...] unit will not amount to as much gold as it did in 1870; perhaps [...] each unit may be rated only at $100. In that case, A is obliged to [...] pay back but eight multiple units, which costs him only $800 in [...] money, while B receives from A the same amount of purchasing power [...] over other commodities which he loaned to him. B had no just claim [...] to ten units, since the fall of all commodities relatively to gold [...] was not due to his exertions. On the other hand, if, between 1870 [...] and 1880, prices had risen, mutatis mutandis, the eight units [...] would have cost A more than $1,000 in gold; but he would have been [...] justly obliged to return the same amount of purchasing power to B [...] which he received from him.|$|E
