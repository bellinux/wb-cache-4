40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This {{research}} {{studied the}} effect of water, rice flour, and small red beans on cooking qualities and texture of tapioca pearls. The gluten free benefits of this product along with the added nutritional value made possible by this research offer a better product to the health food industry. Water content was studied at the 45 and 48 % level; rice flour content was studied at 10 and 20 %, and <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>bean</b> content was studied at 20 and 40 %. For cooking qualities, changes in water absorption, expansion ratio and cooking loss were studied. Hardness, springiness and adhesiveness were analyzed for raw tapioca pearls while hardness and springiness were analyzed for cooked tapioca pearls. The results showed that compared to 45 % water, 48 % water significantly increased the water absorption, expansion ratio and slightly reduced cooking loss. Higher water content significantly decreased hardness and increased springiness of raw and cooked tapioca pearl. Moreover, higher water content significantly increased stickiness of raw tapioca pearl. Rice flour significantly reduced expansion ratio and water absorption and increased cooking loss. With rice flour, tapioca pearl maintained its spherical shape better after cooking. Rice flour significantly increased hardness and decreased transparency of cooked tapioca pearl. Small red beans gave tapioca pearl a marble pink appearance and made the processing easier by significantly reducing the hardness, springiness and stickiness of raw tapioca pearls. <b>Small</b> <b>red</b> <b>bean</b> content {{should be limited to}} 40 % because it can significantly increase cooking loss. Water content, rice flour and <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>bean</b> had a significant effect on cooking qualities and texture of tapioca pearls. They also changed the appearance and flavor of tapioca pearls, bringing new features to their composition and making it more nutritious. This research provides fundamental information, innovation, and the results of extensive tests [...] all of which were used to make better tapioca pearls. Because of the gluten-free content of the food products that can be made with tapioca pearls, this product will meet the needs of a more health conscious society. The new features add nutrition and introduce a new methodology that will improve the manufacturing process...|$|E

The resultant semi-purified concentrate was fractionated to five fractions (Fr I – Fr V) with Sepha-dex LH- 20. Phytochemical contents, antioxidant and antiproliferative properties of extracts and fractions were evaluated. Results {{indicated that the}} Fr V had the highest total phenolic content and condensed tannin content, and exhibited strong free radical scavenging activity against DPPH and ABTS radicals, with the IC 50 of 0. 128 and 0. 036 mg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the Fr V showed considerable antiproliferative effects against SK-OV- 3, SW 480, CAL 27, and Hep G 2 cancer cells with IC 50 of 0. 035, 0. 111, 0. 035, and 0. 008 mg/mL, respectively. In conclusion, the Fr V, whose constituents were mainly condensed tannins, possessed the highest antioxidant and antiproliferative effects, and thus could be potentially applied as natural antioxidant and antiproliferative agents in both food, cosmetic, or pharmaceutical fields for health promotion...|$|E

The total phenols (TPs), total flavonoids (TB), condensed tannins (CTs), monomeric anthocyanins (MAs), ABTS radical-scavenging capacity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) were evaluated in both groups. Anthocyanins, which appeared at 10 -fold higher levels in BB than SRB (0. 83 mg and 0. 08 mg cyanidin 3 -glucoside equivalents/g of bean, respectively) were undetectable in either extract after digestion. The {{results indicate that}} the in vitro digestion process was responsible for a reduction of the TPs, CTs and MAs in both the BB and SRB seed coats, and of TFs in the BB seed coats. However, the antioxidant activity was maintained for both groups, and even significantly increased in the BB group when measured with an ORAC assay. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>red</b> <b>beans,</b> {{commonly}} called Mexican beans, {{are a part}} of the legume family, the genus Phaseolus vulgaris, i. e., dry edible beans or the common bean. In addition to being a rich source of nutrients, <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>beans</b> also contain phenolic compounds, such as ﬂavonoids, tannins, phenolic acids, and anthocyanins that have shown a plethora of health beneﬁts against such conditions as obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. In particular, the phenolic compounds common to the <b>red</b> <b>beans</b> have been reported to protect against chronic inflammation that if left unchecked can lead to various other chronic degenerative diseases. These benefits may be attributed to the phenolic compounds acting in combination as either synergists or additives. Optimal parameters are therefore needed to characterize the type and amount of these diverse phenolic compounds in any food system or matrix, and then to correlate the results to the condition of interest, which in this study is inflammation. However, such studies are non-existent for <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>beans</b> despite the presence of chemically diverse phenols at relatively high levels, (depending on the extraction parameters). Therefore, the objective of this research was to apply response surface methods (RSM) to obtain phenolic rich extracts from two lines of <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>beans</b> (NE 36 and NE 40). The study was completed using three factor face centered cube design (FCCD) to investigate the effect of three independent variables, solid:solvent ratio, solvent polarity and mix time on response of total phenols (TP), total flavonoids (TF) and anti-oxidative capacity (AC). The most effective factors that resulted in overall maximum TP yields were acetone: solvent (water) composition of 50 %, a solid:solvent ratio of 10 % and a mix time of 60 min. For optimal TF extractions, an acetone:water composition of 75 %, solid:solvent ratio of 10 % and mix time of 180 min were required. Maximum AC values were achieved with an ethanol:water composition of 75 %, solid:solvent ratio of 10 % and a mix time of 180 min. In most cases, a second order polynomial model was developed to optimize the extractions with the exception of TP for ethanol extractions and TF for acetone extractions for NE 36. Preliminary data obtained in our lab indicated that higher order models (cubic) better explained the complex interactions. The extractions that produced the highest yields of TP, TF and AC were then tested for the ability to remediate inflammation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activated RAW 264. 7 macrophages. As nitric oxide is an indicator of inflammation, this test was applied to extract treated cells to determine their ability to remediate inflammation. Only the extracts with high TF show significant anti-inflammatory activities using this vitro model, with the NE 36 line showing the most efficacious results. In summary, this study has shown that that optimum phenolic yields (TP and TF) and potent AC and anti-inflammatory extracts are dependent upon the extraction methods and solvents used, and also vary with different lines of <b>red</b> <b>beans.</b> This research is therefore significant as it has shown the potential of <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>beans</b> as a health impacting food system, with an emphasis on remediating inflammation.

40|$|General Production Information Dry edible bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is a {{relatively}} new crop to the North Dakota-Minnesota region (Berglund 1997). They have been grown on a large scale since the 1970 s. North Dakota produced approximately 8, 265, 000 cwt. of dry beans in 1999 (Table 1). A total of 630, 000 acres were planted and 570, 000 acres were harvested, with an average of 1, 450 lbs yield per acre. Two classes of dry bean (navy and pinto) encompass the major commercial acreage. In addition, black turtle, dark and light red kidney, great northern, cranberry, pinks, and <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>bean</b> classes are also grown on limited acres. Twenty-five percent of the dry edible beans (DEB) are grown under contract annually; the remainder of the crop is sold on the open market, or delivered to a processing firm after harvest. Firms are located throughout the eastern half of North Dakota and west central Minnesota counties. The industry is anchored regionally by Northarvest Bean Growers Association which provides a full range of services and funding assistance to facilitate the greater utilization of North Dakota and Minnesota grown DEB. Bounded by the green fields of America's cornbelt on the south and the golden Canadian wheat fields on the north, Northarvest spans 112, 000 square miles of fertile soil.

One {{of the most common}} protein components of the broiler ration is soybean meal derived from soybeans grown in the Midwestern United States. In an effort to reduce the reliance on this product, alternative local feedstuffs were examined. Three experiments were performed to identify the feasibility of including Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) and Pisum sativum (field pea) in broiler rations. The first experiment assessed the 30 % inclusion of three different raw beans, pinto, Great Northern white, and <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>beans</b> into broiler diets for 42 days. Pinto beans outperformed both white and <b>red</b> <b>beans,</b> but weight gain and feed efficiency of all three were significantly reduced when compared to the corn-soy based control diet. Experiment two compared the growth rates of broiler chicks fed diets containing either 30 % heat-treated or 30 % raw versions of the three bean cultivars for 21 days. Chick growth was improved by the heat treatment of Great Northern white beans; however, heat treatment demonstrated little or no impact on the birds fed pinto or <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>beans.</b> The final experiment assessed the general dietary inclusion of field peas and the alternative feeding practices of sprouting legume grains completely excluding imported soy products. Including field peas at 30 % of the total ration did not inhibit broiler growth when compared to the corn-soy based control diet in the 42 day trial. In a 30 % pea diet, sprouting 10 % of those peas did not significantly alter chick growth when compared to a standard inclusion of 30 % dried field peas; however, feed conversion was significantly improved.

Dry beans and snap beans are the same species, {{although}} dry beans are distinguished from snap beans (green beans) which are consumed as immature pods. Dry and snap beans also differ from soybeans (Glycine max), in which the seeds are consumed in a variety of processed forms such as tofu, soybean meal, oil, and fermented forms such as miso. Dry beans are divided into classes with a range of seed sizes, colors, and shapes. Examples include black beans, pintos, navy <b>beans,</b> <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>beans,</b> and kidney beans.

40|$|Flooding is {{a devastating}} abiotic stress that endangers crop {{production}} in the twenty-first century. Because of the severe susceptibility of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to flooding, {{an understanding of the}} genetic architecture and physiological responses of this crop will set the stage for further improvement. However, challenging phenotyping methods hinder a large-scale genetic study of flooding tolerance in common bean and other economically important crops. A greenhouse phenotyping protocol was developed to evaluate the flooding conditions at early stages. The Middle-American diversity panel (n = 272) of common bean was developed to capture most of the diversity exits in North American germplasm. This panel was evaluated for seven traits under both flooded and non-flooded conditions at two early developmental stages. A subset of contrasting genotypes was further evaluated in the field to assess the relationship between greenhouse and field data under flooding condition. A genome-wide association study using ~ 150 K SNPs was performed to discover genomic regions associated with multiple physiological responses. The results indicate a significant strong correlation (r > 0. 77) between greenhouse and field data, highlighting the reliability of greenhouse phenotyping method. Black and <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>beans</b> were the least affected by excess water at germination stage. At the seedling stage, pinto and great northern genotypes were the most tolerant. Root weight reduction due to flooding was greatest in pink and <b>small</b> <b>red</b> cultivars. Flooding reduced the chlorophyll content to the greatest extent in the navy bean cultivars compared with other market classes. Races of Durango/Jalisco and Mesoamerica were separated by both genotypic and phenotypic data indicating the potential effect of eco-geographical variations. Furthermore, several loci were identified that potentially represent the antagonistic pleiotropy. The GWAS analysis revealed peaks at Pv 08 / 1. 6 Mb and Pv 02 / 41 Mb that are associated with root weight and germination rate, respectively. These regions are syntenic with two QTL reported in soybean (Glycine max L.) that contribute to flooding tolerance, suggesting a conserved evolutionary pathway involved in flooding tolerance for these related legumes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND:Sequencing of cDNA {{libraries}} for {{the development}} of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) {{as well as for the}} discovery of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) has been a common method of developing microsatellites or SSR-based markers. In this research, our objective was to further sequence and develop common bean microsatellites from leaf and root cDNA libraries derived from the Andean gene pool accession G 19833 and the Mesoamerican gene pool accession DOR 364, mapping parents of a commonly used reference map. The root libraries were made from high and low phosphorus treated plants. RESULTS:A total of 3, 123 EST sequences from leaf and root cDNA libraries were screened and used for direct simple sequence repeat discovery. From these EST sequences we found 184 microsatellitesthe majority containing tri-nucleotide motifs, many of which were GC rich (ACC, AGC and AGG in particular). Di-nucleotide motif microsatellites were about half as common as the tri-nucleotide motif microsatellites but most of these were AGn microsatellites with a moderate number of ATn microsatellites in root ESTs followed by few ACn and no GCn microsatellites. Out of the 184 new SSR loci, 120 new microsatellite markers were developed in the BMc (Bean Microsatellites from cDNAs) series and these were evaluated for their capacity to distinguish bean diversity in a germplasm panel of 18 genotypes. We developed a database with images of the microsatellites and their polymorphism information content (PIC), which averaged 0. 310 for polymorphic markers. CONCLUSIONS:The present study produced information about microsatellite frequency in root and leaf tissues of two important genotypes for common bean genomics: namely G 19833, the Andean genotype selected for whole genome shotgun sequencing from race Peru, and DOR 364 a race Mesoamerica subgroup 2 genotype that is a small-red seeded, released variety in Central America. Both race Peru and Mesoamerica subgroup 2 (<b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>beans)</b> have been understudied in comparison to race Nueva Granada and Mesoamerica subgroup 1 (black beans) both with regards to gene expression and as sources of markers. However, we found few differences between SSR type and frequency between the G 19833 leaf and DOR 364 root tissue-derived ESTs. Overall, our work adds to the analysis of microsatellite frequency evaluation for common bean and provides a new set of 120 BMc markers which combined with the 248 previously developed BMc markers brings the total in this series to 368 markers. Once we include BMd markers, which are derived from GenBank sequences, the current total of gene-based markers from our laboratory surpasses 500 markers.

In addition, the beneficial effects of bioremediation with the oil-degrading microorganism, Nocardia sp.

It was found that crude oil-contaminated soil (10, 000 mg/kg) was phytotoxic to corn and <b>red</b> <b>beans.</b> In contrast, obvious phytotoxicity was not observed in soils contaminated with 0 – 1000 mg/kg of aliphatic hydrocarbons such as decane (C 10) and eicosane (C 20). Phytotoxicity was observed in soils contaminated with 10 – 1000 mg/kg of the poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene. It was observed that phytotoxicity increased {{with the number of}} aromatic rings, and that corn was more sensitive than <b>red</b> <b>beans</b> to PAH-contaminated soil.

The two cotyledons of the beans were separated by a deep fissure. A view of seed coat surface of adzuki beans revealed a characteristic pattern of convolutions and cracks, not observed on the seed coat surfaces of black or <b>red</b> <b>beans.</b> The cro sssection of seed coat of adzuki beans exhibited {{a thick layer of}} palisade cells in the epidermal layer followed by underlaid multiple layers of tightly packed parenchyma cells. A sub-epidermal layer comprised of a single layer of hour-glass cells was observed in the black and <b>red</b> <b>bean</b> seed coats but not in adzuki beans. A cross-section of the hilum region of adzuki <b>beans</b> and Mexican <b>red</b> <b>beans</b> exhibited a double palisade layer, a phenomenon not observed in the black beans. The cross-section of the sub-hilar region of the adzuki and Mexican <b>red</b> <b>beans</b> revealed a sub-hilar plug, not observed in the black bean sub-hilar region. The micrographs of adzuki bean cotyledons showed spherical starch granules with an apparent pitted surface and were loosely embedded in a protein matrix. The starch granules of black and Mexican <b>red</b> <b>beans</b> were more oval in shape, with a smoother surface, more compactly packed and embedded in a protein matrix.
