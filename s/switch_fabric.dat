For a switch using a nonblocking <b>switching</b> <b>fabric,</b> {{the performance of the}} switch depends on the performance of its cell scheduler. We introduce the concepts of relative and universal scheduler scalabilities. Informally, a scheduler is relatively scalable with respect to a <b>switching</b> <b>fabric</b> if its structure is not more complex than the structure of its associated non-blocking <b>switching</b> <b>fabric.</b> A scheduler is universally scalable if its structural complexity is not larger than the structural complexity of any non-blocking <b>switching</b> <b>fabric.</b> Based on algorithm-hardware co-design, we present a universally scalable scheduler with O(N log N) interconnection complexity. We show by simulation that the performance of the proposed scheduler is almost the same as non-scalable schedulers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Growing {{bandwidth}} requirements of future Internet applications are driving the potential deployment of all-optical packet <b>switching</b> <b>fabrics</b> in next-generation routers. The <b>switching</b> <b>fabric</b> should {{be capable of}} executing a fast reconfiguration of its switching state, allowing for the dynamic management of optical packets and the seamless recovery of the fabric, {{in the case of}} IP-layer router failures and cross-layer enabled optical-layer signal degradations.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a focus on}} the architecture of a high-speed packet <b>switching</b> <b>fabric</b> and its performance. The <b>switching</b> <b>fabric</b> is suited for existing transparent protocols, based on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology and standards in an environment of Local Area Network (LAN). A high-speed <b>switching</b> <b>fabric</b> architecture which adopts Time Division mode and bases on a shared medium approach is proposed. This is an architecture for nonblocking performance, no congestion and high reliability. Its principle for performance is a method of sequentially scheduling the inputs and the transferring of bits in parallel. To study the performance of the <b>switching</b> <b>fabric</b> architecture one uses OPNET communication simulation software. Some parameters including the throughputs, the transfer (the <b>switching</b> <b>fabric)</b> delay, the <b>switching</b> overflow and the packet size in the buffer (the input buffer and the output buffer) are implemented through the simulation. And finally, an analysis for the results of the simulation for local ATM IDS fabric architecture is discussed.

50|$|This {{method of}} {{forwarding}} was first introduced with the Supervisor 2 engine. When used in combination with a <b>switch</b> <b>fabric</b> module, each line card has an 8Gbit/s connection to the <b>switch</b> <b>fabric</b> and additionally {{a connection to the}} classic bus. In this mode, assuming all line cards have a <b>switch</b> <b>fabric</b> connection, an ingress packet is queued as before and its headers are sent along the dBus to the supervisor. They are looked up in the PFC (including ACLs etc.) and then the result is placed on the rBus. The initial egress line card takes this information and forwards the data to the correct line card along the <b>switch</b> <b>fabric.</b> The main advantage here {{is that there is a}} dedicated 8 Gbit/s connection between the line cards. The receiving line card queues the egress packet before sending it from the desired port.|$|E

40|$|All-optical {{networks}} have attracted significant attention because they promise to provide significant advantages in throughput, bandwidth, scalability, reliability, security, and energy efficiency. These six features appealed to optical transport-network operators {{in the past}} and, currently, to cloud-computing and data-center providers. But, the absence of optical processors and optical Random Access Memory (RAM) has forced the optical network designers to use optical-to-electrical conversion on the input side of every node so the node can process packet headers and store data during the switching operation. And, at every node’s output side, all data must be converted from its electronic form back to the optical domain before being transmitted over fiber to the next node. This practice reduces all six of those advantages the network would have if it were all-optical. So, to achieve a network that is all-optical end-to-end, many all-optical <b>switching</b> <b>fabrics</b> have been proposed. Many of these proposed <b>switching</b> <b>fabrics</b> lack a control algorithm to operate them. Two control algorithms are proposed in this dissertation for two previously-proposed <b>switching</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The first control algorithm operates a timeslot interchanger and the second operates a space/time <b>switching</b> <b>fabric</b> - where both these photonic systems are characterized by active Feed-Forward Fiber Delay Line (FF-FDL) and the frame-integrity constraint.
