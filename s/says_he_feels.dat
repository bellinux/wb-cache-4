2500|$|In 2004, Miller {{orchestra}} bassist Herman [...] "Trigger" [...] Alpert {{explained the}} band's success: [...] "Miller had America's music pulse ... He knew what would please the listeners." [...] Although Miller had massive popularity, many jazz {{critics of the}} time had misgivings. They believed that the band's endless rehearsals—and, according to critic Amy Lee in Metronome magazine, [...] "letter-perfect playing"—diminished any feeling from performances. They also felt that Miller's brand of swing shifted popular music away from the [...] "hot jazz" [...] bands of Benny Goodman and Count Basie, and toward commercial novelty instrumentals and vocal numbers. For years, even after Miller died, the Miller estate maintained an unfriendly stance toward critics that derided the band during Miller's lifetime. Miller was often criticized for being too commercial. His answer, [...] "I don't want a jazz band." [...] Many modern jazz critics still harbor similar antipathy toward Miller. As recently as 1997 on a website administered by JazzTimes, Miller is listed {{as an example of}} an overrated jazz musician by Doug Ramsey. [...] "Miller was a businessman who discovered a popular formula from which he allowed little departure. A disproportionate ratio of nostalgia to substance keeps his music alive." [...] Jazz critics Gunther Schuller (1991), Gary Giddins (2004) and Gene Lees (2007) have separately defended the Miller orchestra for whatever deficiencies earlier critics have found. In an article written for The New Yorker in 2004, Gary Giddins <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> that these early critics erred in denigrating Miller's music, and that the popular opinion of the time should hold greater sway. The article states: [...] "Miller exuded little warmth on or off the bandstand, but once the band struck up its theme, audiences were done for: throats clutched, eyes softened. Can any other record match 'Moonlight Serenade' for its ability to induce a Pavlovian slaver in so many for so long?" [...] Schuller, notes, [...] " [...] was nevertheless very special and able to penetrate our collective awareness that few other sounds have..." [...] He compares it partially to [...] "Japanese Gagaku [...] Hindu music" [...] in its purity. Schuller and Giddins do not take completely uncritical approaches to Miller. Schuller says that Ray Eberle's [...] "lumpy, sexless vocalizing dragged down many an otherwise passable performance." [...] However finally Schuller notes: [...] "How much further [...] musical and financial ambitions might have carried him must forever remain conjectural. That it would have been significant, whatever form(s) it might have taken, is not unlikely." ...|$|E

The two latter also hunt by day when the fancy takes them or they have been so {{unsuccessful}} at night that their stomachs won't give them any peace, and Peter is sure that though they can see very well at night, they can see still better in the light of day. Anyway, that is one of the reasons he gives for his own liking for roaming after jolly, round, red Mr. Sun has gone to bed behind the Purple Hills.|$|E

60|$|Now I should {{imagine that}} if Filmer had seen fit {{at this stage}} to define just what he was feeling, and to take a {{definite}} line {{in the matter of}} his ascent, he might have escaped that painful ordeal quite easily. If he had had it clearly in his mind he could have done endless things. He would surely have found no difficulty with a specialist to demonstrate a weak heart, or something gastric or pulmonary, to stand in his way--that is the line I am astonished he did not take,--or he might, had he been man enough, have declared simply and finally that he did not intend to do the thing. But the fact is, though the dread was hugely present in his mind, the thing was by no means sharp and clear. I fancy that all through this period he kept telling himself that when the occasion came he would find himself equal to it. He was like a man just gripped by a great illness, who <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> a little out of sorts, and expects to be better presently. Meanwhile he delayed the completion of the machine, and let the assumption {{that he was going to}} fly it take root and flourish exceedingly about him. He even accepted anticipatory compliments on his courage. And, barring this secret squeamishness, there can be no doubt he found all the praise and distinction and fuss he got a delightful and even intoxicating draught.|$|E
