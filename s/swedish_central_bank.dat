25|$|The American {{economist}} and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman {{has suggested that}} he fails {{to understand how the}} short term costs of euro membership to the Finnish economy outweigh the large gains caused by greater integration with the European economy. Krugman notes, that Sweden which has yet to join the single currency, had similar rates of growth compared to Finland for the period since the introduction of the euro. Membership of the euro protects Finland from currency fluctuation, which is particularly important for small member states of the European Union like Finland that are highly integrated into the larger European economy. If Finland had retained its own currency, an unpredictable exchange rates would prevent the country from selling its products at competitive prices on the European market. In fact, business leaders in Sweden, which is obliged to join the euro when its economy has converged with the eurozone, are almost universal in their support for joining the euro. Although Sweden's currency is not officially pegged to the euro like Denmark's currency the Swedish government maintains an unofficial peg. This exchange rate policy has in the short term benefited the Swedish economy in two ways; (1) much of Sweden's European trade is already denominated in euros and therefore bypasses any currency fluctuation and exchange rate losses, (2) it allows Sweden's non euro-area exports to remain competitive by dampening any pressure from the financial markets to increase the value of the currency. Maintaining this balance has allowed the Swedish government to borrow on the international financial markets at record low interest rates and allowed the <b>Swedish</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> to quantitatively ease into a fundamentally sound economy. This has led Sweden's economy to prosper at the expense of less sound economies who have been impacted by the 2008 financial crisis. Sweden's economic performance has therefore been slightly better than Finland's since the financial crisis of 2008. Much of this disparity has, however, been due to the economic dominance of Nokia, Finlands largest company and Finland's only major multinational. Nokia supported and greatly benefited from the euro and the European single market, particularly from a common European digital mobile phone standard (GSM), but it failed to adapt when the market shifted to mobile computing. One reason for the popularity of the euro in Finland is the memory of a 'great depression' which began in 1990, with Finland not regaining it competitiveness until approximately a decade later when Finland joined the single currency. Some American economists like Paul Krugman claim not to understand the benefits of a single currency and allege that poor economic performance is the result of membership of the single currency. These economists do not, however, advocate separate currencies for member states within the American union, many of which have quite disparate economies.|$|E

Using a unique and extensive data set from the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Bank’s</b> Settlement Reports, covering nine different industries, we model the firms choice of export currency as a multinomial logit model. We find {{that the size of}} the foreign mar-ket and more developed financial markets in the importing country increases the likelihood of the importer’s currency being used. High inflation, distance and foreign exchange rate restrictions reduces the likelihood of the importer’s currency being used. Higher exchange rate volatility makes it less likely that the exporter’s currency is being used and instead increases the likelihood of use of a vehicle currency. We are also able to draw conclusions about the changing role of the euro as an international currency, as well as the use of Swedish kronor. We find that the euro is becoming more extensively used, mainly as a vehicle currency over the period 1999 - 2002. During the same period the use of the Swedish krona is falling in all industries although the degree of producer currency pricing differs considerably between industries...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} whether <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> should emphasize financial stability when setting their policy rate {{has created an}} ongoing debate among policy makers and economists since the Global Financial Crisis. In this thesis, I examine whether Scandinavian <b>central</b> <b>banks,</b> with a main focus on Norway, should use monetary policy to support financial stability. In international literature, this type of policy {{is referred to as}} “Leaning Against the Wind”. This is done by <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> raising their policy rate above what is necessary for reaching the traditional inflation target and keeping output stable. The general idea is that this policy will benefit the economy through a reduced probability of a financial crisis in the future. But, increasing the policy rate also inflicts costs. In this context, the cost is expressed by an increase unemployment rate in the following period. This strategy is compared to a traditional one where financial stability is not considered. The thesis begins with an empirical study to discover which financial variables can explain the occurrence of financial crises best. The data material is based on annualized observations from 1870 to 2013. I find lagged real debt growth 5 years before a financial crisis to be the best explanatory variable. As a second step, the result is used in a cost-benefit framework to examine how leaning as a policy affects the welfare in the economies. This is done by using a loss function, consisting of unemployment only. I take advantage of impulse responses from both the Norwegian and the <b>Swedish</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> to investigate how an increase in the policy rate would affect both credit and unemployment. I also estimate these two effects in my own VAR-model to examine how using a different model affect the outcome. I conclude that Leaning Against the Wind {{does not appear to be}} a desired policy for a Scandinavian <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> The cost of leaning simply outweighs the potential benefits. I also discover that this result is quite sensitive to the assumptions made in the framework, the parameters from the central banks` DSGE models, and the effect of macroprudential policy. Replacing the parameters from the DSGE-models of the <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> to my own VARestimates based on Norwegian data worsened the argument for leaning, making the costs outweigh the benefits even more. The VAR-results implies that leaning has costs due to an increased unemployment rate, but also an additional cost as a total increase in the probability of a financial crisis...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} inflation and inflation uncertainty in Finland, Germany and Sweden in the past 35 years. The hypotheses by Friedman (1976) and Cukierman and Meltzer (1986) are considered. We also investigate whether {{the introduction of the}} common monetary policy on the euro area in 1999 has influenced inflation uncertainty in Finland and Germany. In addition, we examine whether the introduction of inflation targeting in 1993 by the Finnish and <b>Swedish</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> have significantly affected inflation uncertainty. It is commonly accepted, that the main cost related to inflation arises from inflation uncertainty. Friedman (1976) suggested that higher inflation leads to higher inflation uncertainty, and therefore policies lowering inflation should also reduce uncertainty and thus the costs related to inflation. Cukierman and Meltzer (1986) proposed a reversed causality relationship, where higher inflation uncertainty leads to higher inflation. These hypotheses are discussed in the theoretical part. Inflation uncertainty is modelled with GARCH-in-mean (GARCH-M) specifications, where the conditional variance of inflation serves as a proxy for inflation uncertainty. The GARCH-M model also allows for determining the direct relationship between inflation and uncertainty. Asymmetric effects of uncertainty to positive and negative inflation shocks are determined with the GJR-GARCH-M model. The CGARCH-M specification, which differs between long term and short term uncertainty, is also utilised. Friedman's hypothesis is broadly accepted in the empirical part of the thesis, while support for the proposition by Cukierman and Meltzer cannot be found. Thus policies lowering and stabilising inflation, such as inflation targeting, should reduce inflation uncertainty. Although some evidence in favour of a decline in inflation uncertainty since inflation targeting was introduced by the Bank of Finland and the Riksbank can be found, the results depend on the preferred specification. In addition, inflation uncertainty seems to have increased rather than decreased in Finland and Germany in connection to the EMU, although the results are diverse and especially for Finland the size of the effect is almost negligible. However, despite the clear decline in average inflation during the past 35 years, no significant decline in inflation uncertainty has occurred in connection to the ECB. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Abstract The debate {{concerning}} {{the importance of}} <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> independence on inflation rates has, for several years been ambiguous. Some economists, among which Nobel Prize Laureates Kydland and Prescott (1977) argue that <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> independence {{is crucial to the}} achievement of price-stability. Others, such as Daunfeltd and de Luna (2008) could in their studies not find any substantial arguments in favour of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> independence as the key, explaining the successful achievement and maintenance of a low and stable inflation goal. In this paper, we use One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Pearson’s correlation test to examine the impact, if any, that <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> independence has on inflation rates. We focus our analysis on a ten year period from 1999 to 2009, looking at the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Central</b> Bank; the Riksbank, and the European Central Bank; the ECB. The empirical analysis revealed no negative correlation between price-stability and <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> independence. In fact, we found with a 99 % confidence interval that the correlation coefficient between these two variables was only 0. 12, a rather weak positive relationship. In Sweden and the Euro-zone we discovered that price stability was achieved years before the concerned <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> were officially declared independent. Also, although the world’s most independent <b>central</b> <b>bank,</b> the ECB did not show the lowest inflation rates. These indices suggest that the decisive elements behind a state's low inflation lies beyond the parameters of its <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> This provides reason to question the belief that institutional reforms granting <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> more independence are necessary for the achievement and upkeep of price-stability. According to previous research and our own analysis on this topic, a true commitment to sound fiscal policy and a strong inflation adverse social attitude appear to be the variables that most strongly determine the outcome of a low inflation goal.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{among the first to}} provide insight into the {{assessment}} of the <b>Swedish</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank’s</b> (Riksbank) three unconventional monetary policies (UMPs) and their influence on Swedish commercial banks. The three UMPs include forward guidance (FG), quantitative easing (QE) and negative interest rate policy (repo rate). Riksbank introduced the UMPs in order to revive inflation and support Sweden’s economic recovery. The banks’ ability to certainly forecast their operations is highly dependent on the communication availed by the Riksbank on its expected future monetary policies through FG. QE is paramount because this is when commercial banks sell government bonds to the Riksbank. Repo rate determines interest rates set by banks. Four indicators (uncertainty, government bond yields, bank interest rates, borrowing and lending) were used in this study to investigate the perception of the commercial banks on the three UMPs. There are limited studies on Swedish banks’ perception of the UMPs which leaves a research gap in this area. Previous studies indicate that dominant banks in terms of asset shares and deposits are more sensitive to monetary policy shocks. The four dominant commercial banks studied include: Nordea, Handelsbanken, Swedbank and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. This thesis considers the evidence of the results from previous empirical studies. Empirical material for this study was collected through semi-structured interviews from respondents by the Riksbank and the four commercial banks. A deductive approach was used to interpret the information collected. Our results presents various perceptions of the dominant commercial banks on the three UMPs in relation to the four indicators. Some commercial banks perceived the increased transparency and clarity during the increased FG to have reduced their uncertainty. Other banks perceived that FG had increased their uncertainty. They questioned the credibility of the FG since they could not predict Riksbank’s monetary policies with the FG availed. In regards to the perception of QE on uncertainty, an increased signalling channel during QE implementation had resulted in a decline of their uncertainty since they were experiencing a surplus of liquidity in the banking sector. However, they stated other factors that increased market volatility during QE. The increased market volatility during QE increased their uncertainty. The four commercial banks agreed that the demand for government bonds increased while the yields of the government bonds declined. They perceived these changes to have been influenced by QE. The commercial banks’ lending, deposit and interbank interest rates have declined systematically correlating the trend of the declining repo rate. The four banks experienced a decline in their average net interest income, an improved flow of credit through higher lending volumes and stable lending margins to households and firms. Commercial banks perceived these changes to have resulted from the declining market interest rates because of the negative repo rate. Riksbank can use this study to assess the effectiveness of its UMPs on commercial banks based on the perception of the employees from these respective banks. This study discusses implications of the findings for commercial banks and the Riksbank, as well as academics in the realm of implementations and influences of UMPs...|$|R
