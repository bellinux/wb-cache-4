50|$|Lucy and Tom {{take their}} torches {{to hide in}} the woods from him when their car runs out of petrol. In the {{darkness}} Tom is grabbed and disappears. Lucy returns to the car alone and finds a petrol can in the front seat. After refilling the tank and with the satnav now mysteriously working again, Lucy drives on and eventually finds the hotel, but discovers that it is abandoned. The car park is a graveyard <b>of</b> <b>derelict</b> <b>cars,</b> suggesting that she and Tom are not the first victims.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, a {{collection}} <b>of</b> 60 <b>derelict</b> <b>cars</b> {{was found at}} a farm in Western France. The collection included a Ferrari California Spyder, formerly owned by Alain Delon, that sold for €15.9 million when auctioned in 2015. There were several Talbot Lago T26s, {{one of which was}} formerly owned by King Farouk of Egypt. Other cars were built by Bugatti, Hispano-Suiza, Panhard-Levassor, Delahaye and Delage.|$|R
2500|$|Red {{attempted}} to demonstrate creative and often humorous ways to tackle relatively common tasks, such as {{taking out the}} trash or making use <b>of</b> <b>derelict</b> <b>cars,</b> or to create something extravagant out of whatever {{he could get his}} hands on. Memorable examples included a paddlewheeler made out of a van on pallets and a revolving door, a jetpack made from two propane tanks, a hybrid car from recycled golf carts and satellite dishes, and a kiddie ride made from a bar stool attached to the agitator of a washing machine. Duct tape, [...] "the handyman's secret weapon," [...] was almost always the fastener of choice. In one episode, he tried to duct tape the Ontario-Quebec border as a potential solution to Quebec separatism. The segment customarily concluded with the aphorism [...] "If the women don't find you handsome, they should at least find you handy." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the robber}} {{was in no}} mood for further conversation. Far away down the road tiny points of light had appeared. Fresh {{business}} was coming to him, and he must not mix his cases. Disengaging his machine, he raised his hat, and slipped off to meet this new arrival, while Miss Flossie and Miss Hilda leaned out <b>of</b> their <b>derelict</b> <b>car,</b> still palpitating from their adventure, and watched the red gleam of the tail-light until it merged into the darkness.|$|R
5000|$|The centre {{was used}} as an {{abandoned}} mall in the BBC One series Luther. It appeared in the 2012 film Dredd, where it was restored to a semblance of its former glory with a Blade Runner-like makeover. It was used in the first episode of the 2011 BBC Three series The Fades. Oriental City was the single location used for the 2012 TV film of a Royal Shakespeare Company production of Julius Caesar, directed by Gregory Doran. The complex appeared in 2013 during a first season episode of the BBC Two series Charlie Brooker's Weekly Wipe, with Brooker wandering around various parts <b>of</b> the <b>derelict</b> <b>car</b> park, Zen Tian Di Chinese buffet and a set of escalators. The centre was also used for the music video Bittersweet Memories by Welsh metalcore band Bullet For My Valentine ...|$|R
500|$|On December 8, 1945, Patton's {{chief of}} staff, Major General Hobart Gay, invited {{him on a}} {{pheasant}} hunting trip near Speyer to lift his spirits.

[...] Moments later his car collided with an American army truck at low speed.|$|R
40|$|Explains {{that the}} 1993 Department of Environment Survey <b>of</b> <b>Derelict</b> Land in England {{found that the}} area <b>of</b> <b>derelict</b> land in England between 1988 and 1993 {{remained}} relatively static, despite the considerable sums of public money spent on derelict land reclamation during this period. With the launch of English Partnerships in 1993, and its subsuming <b>of</b> <b>Derelict</b> Land Grant the following year, evaluates {{the changes in the}} funding <b>of</b> <b>derelict</b> land reclamation in England and attempts to identify the likely outcomes of such changes. Describes a study in which key players within English Partnerships and Government Offices for the regions were interviewed, as well as local government officers with the responsibility for implementing land reclamation programmes. Concludes {{that there will be a}} reduction in the priority and funding <b>of</b> <b>derelict</b> land reclamation and that as a consequence, the area <b>of</b> <b>derelict</b> land in England may increase for the first time in over a decade...|$|R

50|$|Many salvage yards {{operate on}} a local level—when an {{automobile}} is severely damaged, has malfunctioned beyond repair, or not worth the repair, the owner may sell it to a junkyard; in some cases—as when the car has become disabled {{in a place where}} <b>derelict</b> <b>cars</b> are not allowed to be left—the car owner will pay the wrecker to haul the car away. Salvage yards also buy most <b>of</b> the wrecked, <b>derelict</b> and abandoned vehicles that are sold at auction from police impound storage lots, and often buy vehicles from insurance tow yards as well. The salvage yard will usually tow the vehicle from the location of its purchase to the yard, but occasionally vehicles are driven in. At the salvage yard the automobiles are typically arranged in rows, often stacked on top of one another. Some yards keep inventories in their offices, as to the usable parts in each car, as well as the car's location in the yard. Many yards have computerized inventory systems. About 75% of any given vehicle can be recycled and used for other goods.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of the {{redevelopment}} <b>of</b> <b>derelict</b> buildings and abandoned sites as a complex issue that includes environmental, social and economic aspects. The objective of the research was to suggest a model for determining the rational revitalization <b>of</b> <b>derelict</b> immovable property from the perspective of sustainable development. The authors assume that a multi-criterion analysis is an appropriate technique to use to assure equilibrium among various domains of sustainability. When taking into account the uncertainty of a problem, calculations using the fuzzy version of the TOPSIS method were proposed. The development of a model for determining revitalization priorities of abandoned buildings was based on a case study <b>of</b> <b>derelict</b> rural buildings in Lithuania. A set of indicators was defined and used to perform the multi-criterion analysis of revitalization alternatives <b>of</b> the <b>derelict</b> buildings. Based on results from calculations, scientific recommendations for a rational revitalization of buildings and their sites were prepared.

50|$|For example, a spy {{novel is}} {{expected}} to contain elements such as numbered Swiss bank accounts, a femme fatale, and various spy gadgets hidden in wristwatches, belts, shoes, and other personal effects. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit interpreted the scènes à faire doctrine expansively to hold that a motion picture about the South Bronx would need to feature drunks, prostitutes, vermin, and <b>derelict</b> <b>cars</b> {{to be perceived as}} realistic, and therefore a later film that duplicated these features of an earlier film did not infringe.
