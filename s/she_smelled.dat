25|$|Some {{witnesses}} {{testified that}} they saw Ryan's rifle recoil when he fired and also saw smoke from Ryan's rifle. The owners of the car Ryan got into, Frank and Pauline Jeziorski, {{were two of the}} witnesses. A warder, Thomas Wallis, testified that he saw smoke come out of the rifle Ryan was holding. Pauline Jeziorski testified that <b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> gunpowder after Ryan had fired the shot.|$|E
25|$|Amortentia {{is a love}} potion {{that does}} not create actual love, but gives the drinker a {{powerful}} obsession and infatuation with the giver of the potion. It is usually either forced upon someone or covertly given. As {{a rule of thumb}} the longer a love potion awaits consumption, the stronger the effects will be, as seen in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince when Ron Weasley mistakenly eats a box of Chocolate Cauldrons spiked with the intense love potion intended for Harry previously bought from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. The potion's aroma is unique to each person who consumes it, as it smells like whatever attracts each individual, e.g. Hermione Granger says that she smells spearmint toothpaste, freshly cut grass and a piece of fresh parchment in the movies. In the books, she does not say spearmint toothpaste as the third aroma but instead blushes. (<b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> Ron's hair according to later clarification by the author). It can also be identified by its characteristic spirals of steam and its mother-of-pearl sheen, as noted by Hermione. Unless constantly administered, its effects eventually wear off.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Wendy tells Stan that <b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> Ms. Ellen {{taking a}} [...] "smelly dump" [...] in the {{bathroom}} {{in an attempt to}} make him less attracted to her. In the original script, Wendy originally told Stan that she had a yeast infection, but Comedy Central censors made Parker and Stone change the line. Parker and Stone said although the network typically provides great leniency in permitting obscene jokes, they often object to lines about female hygiene problems. During a cafeteria scene, a boy visible at a lunch table in the background looks exactly like Craig Tucker, but the color of his hat has been changed to make him appear to be a different character. The idea of Ms. Ellen taking one of the children to dinner came from Parker's real-life experiences. At his school, the children were able to have lunch with the teacher and principal if they were awarded [...] "Student of the Week". Parker said he went on one of the lunches once and found the experience [...] "really, really creepy" [...] because he had the impression the teacher and principal were having a romantic affair.|$|E

6000|$|... "The meek {{shall have}} {{herrings}} on earth," [...] mocked the father, also amused. His daughter looked dubiously at him. <b>She</b> <b>smelled</b> impropriety.|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Tad, are y'u heah?" [...] {{she called}} into the blackness. She heard the mice scamper and rustle and <b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> the musty, old, woody odor of a long-unused cabin.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is not Nana's unhappy bark,' she said, little {{guessing}} {{what was}} about to happen; 'that is her bark when <b>she</b> <b>smells</b> danger.' ...|$|R

50|$|Another {{weakness}} Nuku Nuku possesses, though light, is a drunk-like {{state when}} <b>she</b> <b>smells</b> catnip. She'll stagger around and lick anyone who's covered in it.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him full of pain, then {{continued}} slowly to stroke her lips against a ruffled flower. Their scent, as <b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> it, was so much kinder than he; it almost made her cry.|$|E
6000|$|Daphne Wing got up, made a rush, {{and kissed}} her. Her mouth was soft, and <b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> of orange blossom; but Gyp recoiled a little--she hated {{promiscuous}} kisses. Somewhat abashed, Miss Daphne hung her head, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} the sun shone, she got up strong and dancing. Skrebensky was still at the Marsh. He was coming to church. How lovely, how amazing life was! On the fresh Sunday morning {{she went out to}} the garden, among the yellows and the deep-vibrating reds of autumn, <b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> the earth and felt the gossamer, the cornfields across the country were pale and unreal, {{everywhere}} was the intense silence of the Sunday morning, filled with unacquainted noises. <b>She</b> <b>smelled</b> the body of the earth, it seemed to stir its powerful flank beneath her as she stood. In the bluish air came the powerful exudation, the peace was the peace of strong, exhausted breathing, the reds and yellows and the white gleam of stubble were the quivers and motion of the last subsiding transports and clear bliss of fulfilment.|$|E

60|$|He {{laughed and}} his large frame lurched closer. He wore a heavy gun and {{a knife in}} his belt. Also there {{protruded}} the butt of a pistol {{from the inside of}} his open vest. Allie felt the heat from his huge body, and <b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> the whisky upon him, and sensed the base, faithless, malignant animalism of the desperado. Assuredly, if he had any fear, it was not of Durade.|$|E
60|$|For fully half an hour, Gyp {{continued}} to sit up, straining her ears. Where was he? What doing? On her over-excited nerves, {{all sorts of}} possibilities came crowding. He must have gone downstairs again. In that half-drunken state, where would his baffled frenzies lead him? And, suddenly, she thought that <b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> burning. It went, and came again; she got up, crept to the door, noiselessly turned the key, and, pulling it open a few inches, sniffed.|$|E
6000|$|Aubrey, here recollecting himself {{enough to}} be frightened at his father's voice and manner, burst into loud cries; the doctor pressed him closer on his breast, caressed and soothed him. Ethel stood by, pale and transfixed with horror. Her father was more angry with her {{than she had ever}} seen him, and with reason, as she knew, as <b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> the singeing, and saw a large burnt hole in Aubrey's pinafore, while the front of his frock was {{scorched}} and brown. Dr. May's words were not needed, [...] "What could make you let him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|DAWKER. [Grinning] Safe for the moment. The old lady'll {{put it up}} to auction. Couldn't get her {{to budge}} from that. Says she don't want to be unneighbourly to either. But, if you ask me, it's money <b>she</b> <b>smells!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Major, for instance, very {{difficult}} explain Mrs. Barbara how Asika {{so fond of}} you if you only tell her, 'Go away, go away!' all the time, like old saint-gentleman to pretty girl in picture. P'raps <b>she</b> <b>smell</b> rat." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Lucy sees {{in clouds}} of gold green cherry trees upgrow, And bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow; <b>She</b> <b>smells,</b> all faint, the almond-boughs blowing so wild and fair, And doves with milky eyes ascend {{fluttering}} in the air.|$|R
60|$|Some of the fits of {{coughing}} {{were very}} near being her last, but she wrestled with her trouble, seeming {{at times to}} stifle it, and then for weeks she managed {{to go to her}} work, which was still hers, because Shovel's old girl did it for her when the bronchitis would not be defied. Shovel's old slattern gave this service unasked and without payment; if she was thanked it was ungraciously, but she continued to do all she could when there was need; <b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> of gin, but she continued to do all she could.|$|E
60|$|The {{darkness}} lightened, {{turned to}} slow-drifting haze, and lifted. Through {{a thin film}} of blue smoke she saw the rough-hewn timbers of the court roof. A cool, damp touch moved across her brow. <b>She</b> <b>smelled</b> powder, {{and it was that}} which galvanized her suspended thought. She moved, to see that she lay prone upon the stone flags with her head on Lassiter's knee, and he was bathing her brow with water from the stream. The same swift glance, shifting low, brought into range of her sight a smoking gun and splashes of blood.|$|E
60|$|Nicholas and I {{succeeded in}} {{chartering}} the sloop very cheaply; and between laughs, while getting up sail, {{we agreed that}} she was even crazier and older than she had been described. She was a big, flat-bottomed, square-sterned craft, sloop-rigged, with a sprung mast, slack rigging, dilapidated sails, and rotten running-gear, clumsy to handle and uncertain in bringing about, and <b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> vilely of coal tar, with which strange stuff she had been smeared from stem to stern and from cabin-roof to centreboard. And to cap it all, Coal Tar Maggie was printed in great white letters the whole length of either side.|$|E
6000|$|Then Lucy sees {{in clouds}} of gold sweet cherry-trees upgrow, [...] And bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow; [...] <b>She</b> <b>smells</b> all faint the almond-boughs that blow so wild and fair, [...] And doves with milky eyes ascend {{fluttering}} in the air.|$|R
6000|$|... "They'll {{be through}} in a minute. Sniff! <b>She</b> <b>smells</b> good to-night. Dad ships {{a good cook}} ef he do suffer with his brother. It's a full catch today, ain't it?" [...] He pointed at the pens piled high with cod. [...] "What water did ye hev, Manuel?" ...|$|R
50|$|The wolf {{reveals that}} she is really a witch in disguise, and when <b>she</b> <b>smells</b> children, <b>she</b> hides. Hansel and Gretel enter, and find a house made out of gingerbread. They eat a piece, and the witch jumps out and locks them up in a cage to eat later.|$|R
60|$|All {{was in such}} turmoil within her. But no good to show it! No good at all! She {{broke away}} from him, and {{went out into the}} twilight, distraught, but unconvinced. All was {{indeterminate}} and vague within her, like the shapes and shadows in the garden, except--her will to have. A poplar pierced up into the dark-blue sky and touched a white star there. The dew wetted her shoes, and chilled her bare shoulders. She went down to the river bank, and stood gazing at a moonstreak on the darkening water. Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> tobacco smoke, and a white figure emerged as if created by the moon. It was young Mont in flannels, standing in his boat. She heard the tiny hiss of his cigarette extinguished in the water.|$|E
60|$|At that minute Jo was {{particularly}} absorbed in dressmaking, {{for she was}} mantua-maker general to the family, and took especial credit to herself because she could use a needle {{as well as a}} pen. It was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make calls in her best array on a warm July day. She hated calls of the formal sort, and never made any till Amy compelled her with a bargain, bribe, or promise. In the present instance there was no escape, and having clashed her scissors rebelliously, while protesting that <b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> thunder, she gave in, put away her work, and taking up her hat and gloves with an air of resignation, told Amy the victim was ready.|$|E
6000|$|When Gyp had {{finished}} reading, {{she went through}} some moments of such mental anguish as she had never known, but--just as when Betty first told her of the stealing--her wits and wariness came quickly back. Had he been drinking when he wrote that letter? She could almost fancy that <b>she</b> <b>smelled</b> brandy, {{but it was so}} easy to fancy what one wanted to. She read it through again--this time, she felt almost sure that it had been dictated to him. If he had composed the wording himself, he would never have resisted a gibe at the law, or a gibe at himself for thus safeguarding her virtue. It was Rosek's doing. Her anger flamed up anew. Since they used such mean, cruel ways, why need she herself be scrupulous? She sprang out of bed and wrote: ...|$|E
5000|$|Sally Draper (Kiernan Shipka) calls Glen Bishop (Marten Weiner) to {{complain}} about Pauline Francis (Pamela Dunlap), who is babysitting her and Bobby {{while the rest of}} the family is on vacation, calling her step-grandmother [...] "Bluto" [...] and saying <b>she</b> <b>smells</b> like a toilet. Pauline trips on the telephone cord outside the door and falls.|$|R
50|$|One day, a perky, talkative Southern girl {{moves into}} the {{bungalow}} across from them. Amy Cooper (Sandy Duncan) {{has come to the}} big city to train for the Olympics with the best swimming coach in the country. Norman falls instantly in love with her (or rather with the way <b>she</b> <b>smells)</b> and neglects his writing, causing Andy untold headaches.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} a year since Balsa {{protected}} the egg of the Water Spirit from Rarunga. Balsa is traveling through caves in the Misty Blue Mountains {{on her way home}} to Kanbal. In the caves <b>she</b> <b>smells</b> a lantern and discovers the siblings Gina and Kassa defending themselves from a strange creature that Balsa drives off. It leaves behind a rare stone that is extremely valuable, luisha.|$|R
