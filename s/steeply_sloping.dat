5|$|In 1909, Holden won {{the design}} {{competition}} for an extension to the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Subsequently {{dedicated to the}} memory of King Edward VII (died 1910), the extension (1911–12) was built on <b>steeply</b> <b>sloping</b> ground for which Holden designed a linked pair of Portland stone-faced blocks around a courtyard. The plain, abstract blocks have towers on the corners and two-storey loggias, and are a further simplification of Holden's style.|$|E
5|$|Jersey Royal {{potatoes}} are the local {{variety of new}} potato, and the island {{is famous for its}} early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing côtils (<b>steeply</b> <b>sloping</b> fields). Originally grown using vraic as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, {{only a small portion of}} those grown in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} phase of work, {{four types of}} lake margin were constructed. On the southern side of the Central Basin, low reinforced concrete retaining walls were used, while on the eastern side, grouted rock wall can be seen near Commonwealth Park, as well {{as much of the}} East Basin. Sand and gravel beaches were built to cater for lakeside recreational pursuits. These are mostly prevalent on the western half of the lake complex. Rocky outcrops, <b>steeply</b> <b>sloping</b> stable shores with water vegetation such as bullrushes were also used. This treatment is evident in the West Lake in Yarralumla. William Holford and Partners were responsible for the foreshore landscaping, and over 55,000 trees were planted in accordance with a detailed scheme. Eucalypts were preferred so as to maintain the natural colour of the city landscape.|$|E

5|$|The site, a <b>steeply</b> <b>sloping</b> {{hillside}} {{between a}} main railway line {{and one of}} Brighton's main roads, had been {{the home of a}} railway locomotive works and goods yard for more than a century. High-density housing was built {{at the same time and}} surrounded the railway buildings. From the 1960s, the area fell into decline: the works and goods yard were closed and demolished, and most of the housing was cleared. This left large areas of derelict land which attracted small-scale redevelopment and transient commercial enterprises. Proposals for redevelopment were made from the 1980s onwards; in 2001 a master plan was granted planning permission by Brighton and Hove City Council. Site clearance work followed, and construction began in 2004.|$|E
5|$|When Krak des Chevaliers was remodelled in the 13thcentury, new walls {{surrounding}} the inner court were built. They followed the earlier walls, {{with a narrow}} gap between them {{in the west and}} south which was turned into a gallery from which defenders could unleash missiles. In this area, the walls were supported by a <b>steeply</b> <b>sloping</b> glacis which provided additional protection against both siege weapons and earthquakes. Four large, round towers project vertically from the glacis; they were used as accommodation for the Knights of the garrison, about 60 at its peak. The southwest tower was designed to house the rooms of the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller. Though the defences which once crested the walls of the inner wards no longer survive in most places, it seems that they did not extend for the entire circuit. Machicolations were absent from the southern face. The area between the inner court and the outer walls was narrow and not used for accommodation. In the east, where the defences were weakest, there was an open cistern filled by an aqueduct. It acted both as a moat and water supply for the castle.|$|E
25|$|Finally, other {{architectural}} features, {{such as the}} bastion corners {{with their}} pointed conical turrets, the vertically stacked dormer windows separated by a string course, and the high, <b>steeply</b> <b>sloping</b> slate roof, help to give Azay-le-Rideau its unmistakably French appearance.|$|E

40|$|US {{studies have}} {{consistently}} {{reported that the}} relationship between beta and return is less <b>steeply</b> <b>sloped</b> than that implied by the simple CAPM. The introduction of a dividend imputation tax system in Australia and other tax law differences suggest the relationship between beta and return may be more <b>steeply</b> <b>sloped</b> in this country. Empirical evidence subsequent to the introduction of the dividend imputation tax system in July 1987 supports this hypothesis. Further, it is found that no such change occurs in the US market over this time period, which strengthens the conclusion that the finding is tax-driven. Keywords...|$|R

25|$|The <b>steeply</b> <b>sloping</b> west {{flank of}} the northerly hill is clothed with conifer {{plantation}} and mixed woodland, which is managed for pheasant shooting. The summit plateau and gently sloping east flank have a mixture of pasture, arable land and plantation. The soils of the southerly hill are acidic and predominantly nutrient poor, with brown sands on the ridge, and leached podzolic soils as well as brown earths at lower elevations. It supports a mixture of heath and largely deciduous woodland, with some pasture fields.|$|E
25|$|Normanby is {{the name}} of the {{northern}} end of North East Valley, at which point Dunedin's urban area gives way to open countryside. The land here is <b>steeply</b> <b>sloping,</b> as it is the foothills of Mount Cargill. The slopes of Mount Cargill itself are densely wooded, and are crisscrossed with walking tracks, some of which start at the Bethune's Gully reserve, at the northern end of Normanby. Chingford Park, at the Normanby end of the valley is now a sports field and recreational reserve, but was originally the residence of one of Sam Neill's forebears, who was founder of Dunedin Company Wilson Neill. The large house is now gone, but the stone stables still on the site are impressive.|$|E

25|$|For the Norton Bavant Chalk Downland Edge, the 'character' of {{this area}} {{encompasses}} three distinctive, <b>steeply</b> <b>sloping</b> hills (Middle Hill, Scratchbury Hill, and Cotley Hill), which form a distinct and somewhat isolated unit of Chalk Downland Edge. The hills are covered with long fields, which are predominantly arable, with occasional patches of rough remnant chalk grassland and scrub situated {{on the top of}} the hills. Many chalk grassland slopes in England show the mark of centuries of grazing by sheep, the slopes bearing a stepped or striped appearance formed by a mixture of soil creep and sheep paths, and such erosion is visible on the slopes of Scratchbury Hill. Regular patches and belts of mixed woodland populate parts of the lower slopes. Imber military range perimeter paths run across the top of the hills, providing public access to the area.|$|E
25|$|A. chamaeleon can be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} members of the A. rugosus species group by shorter nasal barbels (1.06.0% length of the head vs. 6.523.9), wide-set eyes (distance between eyes 38.947·5% length of the head), and a head with gently sloping lateral margins and a broadly rounded snout when viewed dorsally. A. falcifer can be differentiated from {{other members of}} the species group by an adipose fin with a rounded (vs. angular) posterior margin and a longer dorsal-fin base (10.813.1% standard length vs. 7.910.5); generally the colour pattern of A. falcifer is also different in having many small blotches (vs. few large blotches) of various shades of brown, with many small dark brown spots (vs. no spots) on the dorsal surfaces of the head. Both A. falcifer and A. pachyderma lack serrations on the pectoral spine, but the two species can be separated based on their colouration (cream with numerous small blotches of various shades of brown in A. falcifer vs. overall cream in A. pachyderma) and the shape of the posterior margin of the adipose fin. A. pachyderma can be differentiated by its colouration (overall cream vs. generally dark brown with many irregular patches of light brown) and, except for A. falcifer, lack (vs. presence) of serrations on the posterior edge of the pectoral spine. A. rugosus differs from A. chamaeleon in having longer nasal barbels (6.515.6% head length vs. 1.06.0) and a head with <b>steeply</b> <b>sloping</b> (vs. gentlysloping) lateral margins and a convex (vs. broadly rounded) snout when viewed dorsally; from A. falcifer in having an adipose fin with an angular (vs. rounded) posterior margin; from A. pachyderma in its colouration (generally dark brown with many irregular patches of light brown vs. overall cream) and the presence (vs. lack) of serrations on the posterior edge of the pectoral spine.|$|E
25|$|In the {{swirling}} cloud and snow they abandoned plans to descend via the sharp, unclimbed east ridge. Grove’s partner, Edward North Buxton, suggested {{remaining on the}} summit {{for a couple of}} hours to see if the weather would improve, but the rest of the party rejected his proposal, recognising there was neither sufficient daylight left for them to descend the impossibly exposed and unknown east ridge, nor to down-climb the sheer route they had just ascended. They chose instead to attempt a descent down the unknown southern side of the Aiguille de Bionnassay. They found it trying work to descending the steep ice bank from the summit in the furious storm, but managed eventually to find their way down through one stone-raked couloir to another on the mountain’s south-east face. As twilight fell they reached the head of the Glacier de Bionnassay Italian which formed the northern arm of the huge Glacier du Miage. Here, at a height well above that of the Col de Miage (3,300 m) upon which they could look down, they found refuge amongst rocks beside the steep glacier. They tried to rest there, having had nothing to drink all day except a little brandy and some tasteless wine that they had brought with them; glacial meltwater flowing beneath the rocks on which they sat were totally inaccessible to them. They were also wet through from the storm which by now had passed over, revealing a clear, starry sky. The trickles of water ceased as the temperature dropped below freezing and the night slowly became calm until the silence was shattered by the roar of rockfall over their heads. Abandoning their bivouac site, they took refuge amongst <b>steeply</b> <b>sloping</b> rocks which offered protection from stonefall, but no comfort whatsoever. After a miserable night’s rest, dawn eventually arrived and the ice-rimed party again began to descend the glacier, led by their guide, Cachat. Eight hours later they arrived at the village of St Gervais and sought appropriate refreshment in a well-to-do hotel, much to the disapprobation of the other guests who regarded their appearance and clothing with horror.|$|E
25|$|A field fusilly {{can be very}} {{difficult}} to distinguish from a field lozengy (in early days no clear distinction was made between lozenges and fusils); the fusil is supposed to be proportionately narrower than the lozenge, and the bendwise and bendwise-sinister lines are therefore more <b>steeply</b> <b>sloped.</b>|$|R
