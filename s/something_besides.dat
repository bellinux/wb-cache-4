Traditional cultures see suffering and death as a rite of passage. In fact, their initiation rituals often involve a symbolic death and resurrection, or symbolic ordeals followed by relief. Thus, Eliade argues, modern man can learn to see his historical ordeals, even death, as necessary initiations into {{the next stage of}} one's existence.|$|E

Co-creator Brad Falchuk replied to her, [...] "hope you're qualified to do <b>something</b> <b>besides</b> work in entertainment. Who are you to spoil something talented people have spent months to create?" [...] As a result, Crowther was reportedly fired from the show, however, Crowther later claimed {{that she had not}} been a Glee extra since October 2010, and that she learned the spoiler from a dinner party and not on set. Following the scandal, speculation arose that the ending might be reshot when Monteith tweeted a photograph of himself standing next to Agron, who was wearing a tiara. The show did not comment on this, though Crowther stated that Glee would not be reshooting.|$|E
500|$|Ravel's first {{completed}} opera was L'heure espagnole (premiered in 1911), {{described as}} a [...] "comédie musicale". It is among the works set in or illustrating Spain that Ravel wrote throughout his career. Nichols comments that the essential Spanish colouring gave Ravel a reason for virtuoso use of the modern orchestra, which the composer considered [...] "perfectly designed for underlining and exaggerating comic effects". Edward Burlingame Hill found Ravel's vocal writing particularly skilful in the work, [...] "giving the singers <b>something</b> <b>besides</b> recitative without hampering the action", and [...] "commenting orchestrally upon the dramatic situations and the sentiments of the actors without diverting attention from the stage." [...] Some find the characters artificial and the piece lacking in humanity. The critic David Murray writes that the score [...] "glows with the famous Ravel tendresse".|$|E
500|$|Bizet was {{admitted}} to the Conservatoire on 9 October 1848, two weeks before his 10th birthday. He made an early impression; within six months he had won first prize in solfège, a feat that impressed Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmerman, the Conservatoire's former professor of piano. Zimmerman gave Bizet private lessons in counterpoint and fugue, which continued until the old man's death in 1853. Through these classes, Bizet met Zimmerman's son-in-law, the composer Charles Gounod, who became a lasting influence on the young pupil's musical style—although their relationship was often strained in later years. He also met another of Gounod's young students, the 13-year-old Camille Saint-Saëns, who remained a firm friend of Bizet's. [...] Under the tuition of Antoine François Marmontel, the Conservatoire's professor of piano, Bizet's pianism developed rapidly; he won the Conservatoire's second prize for piano in 1851, and first prize the following year. Bizet would later write to Marmontel: [...] "In your class one learns <b>something</b> <b>besides</b> the piano; one becomes a musician". At the end of his first year, Bizet was required to submit a religious composition, but due to his atheism, he declined and wrote a comic opera instead which was accepted by the committee.|$|E

Rowland {{pointed out that}} several Arthurian novels are set in the Dark Ages, like Rosemary Sutcliff's Sword at Sunset and Mary Stewart's Merlin trilogy (The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills and The Last Enchantment). However, these works {{have little in common}} with the film's story and Sarmatian angle. In {{response}} to criticism of the setting consultant on the film Linda A.

The Shafi'i hadith master Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani stated that [...] "This {{is one of the}} ugliest positions that has been reported of Ibn Taymiyya" [...] and also added that travelling to visit the tomb of the Prophet was [...] "one of the best of actions and the noblest of pious deeds with which one draws near to God, and it's legitimacy is a matter of consensus."
