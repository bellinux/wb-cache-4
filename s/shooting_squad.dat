25|$|While honing {{his forces}} at Macha, Belgrano ordered several {{reconnaissance}} missions on the enemy. He chose {{one of his}} best officers, Lieutenant La Madrid, to collect intelligence about the royalist headquarters at Yocalla. La Madrid departed the republican camp with four Dragoons and a native guide. After an icy-cold night, which ended in a heavy snowfall, the small detachment was just 400 metres away from the enemy stronghold. Not only their recce mission went unnoticed, but they also surprised a royalist patrol marching on the snow and took five prisoners. Only a troop of local natives, loyal to Pezuela, harassed La Madrid's group during their retreat along the defile of Tinguipaya, and informed Castro about his path through the mountains. When the captives were presented to Belgrano, he recognized two of them - a corporal and a soldier - as members of the royalist army defeated in Salta. These men had sworn not to turn their arms on the republicans again. To make an example, Belgrano had them executed by a <b>shooting</b> <b>squad.</b> Their bodies were later beheaded, and their heads, along with a reinforcement of eight Dragoons, were sent to La Madrid, still close to the enemy.|$|E
