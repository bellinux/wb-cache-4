40|$|Computational <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery</b> is {{becoming}} increasingly important {{in many areas of}} science. This chapter reviews the application of computational methods in the formulation of scientific ideas, that is, in the characterization of phenomena and the generation of scientific explanations, in the form of hypotheses, theories, and models. After a discussion of the evolutionary and anthropological roots of <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery,</b> the nature of <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery</b> is considered, and an outline is given of the forms that <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery</b> can take: direct observational discovery, finding empirical rules, and discovery of theories. A discussion of the psychology of <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery</b> includes an assessment of the role of induction. Computational discovery methods in mathematics are then described. This is followed by a survey of methods and associated applications in computational <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery,</b> covering massive systematic search within a defined space; rule-based reasoning systems; classification, machine vision, and related techniques; data mining; finding networks; evolutionary computation; and automation of scientific experiments.

5|$|Increasingly {{concerned}} about the potential danger to humanity arising from <b>scientific</b> <b>discoveries,</b> Oppenheimer joined with Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, Joseph Rotblat and other eminent scientists and academics to establish what would eventually become the World Academy of Art and Science in 1960. Significantly, after his public humiliation, he did not sign the major open protests against nuclear weapons of the 1950s, including the Russell–Einstein Manifesto of 1955, nor, though invited, did he attend the first Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs in 1957.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} {{this period of}} Antarctic interest is what historian H. R. Mill called 'the age of averted interest'. Following the expedition South by the ships HMS Erebus and HMS Terror under James Clark Ross (January, 1841), he suggested {{that there were no}} <b>scientific</b> <b>discoveries,</b> or 'problems', worth exploration in the far South. It is considered that Ross' influence, as well as the loss of the Franklin expedition in the Arctic, led to disinterest in polar inquiry, particularly by The Royal Society: the British-founded organization that helped oversee many Arctic explorations, including those that would be made by Shackleton and Scott. However, in the following twenty years after Ross' return, there is a general lull internationally in Antarctic exploration.|$|E
40|$|Among the {{traditional}} two approaches to <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery,</b> which assume that <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery</b> {{is a totally}} rational or a totally irrational activity, we adopt a third intermediate approach that envisages a bipolar <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery</b> in which man and machine are synergically involved. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to illustrate the mutual interaction between two interesting roles that machine plays in bipolar <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery.</b> In particular, we propose a novel machine of distributed artificial intelligence, called dynamic agency, as suitable to address the double role of supporting man and of describing the results of <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery.</b> The purpos...|$|R

5|$|Black's wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) is {{approached}} at her new job by a colleague, who {{reveals that}} the company is part of the Odessa network. Meanwhile, Black visits Catherine's boss Clear Knight (Kimberly Patton), experiencing visions of Nazi Germany after seeing a watercolour painting in her office. Later that night Black is visited by Means and the Old Man (R. G. Armstrong), another high-ranking Group member. They explain to Black that the Group has, throughout history, been privy to <b>scientific</b> <b>discoveries</b> of which the public has no knowledge. Johnstone had theorised the existence of a tear in the universe which would reach Earth in several decades; his death may be connected to this theory. The Old Man also explains that the Group has been infiltrated in the hopes of splintering it, by members of the Odessa network—a faction founded by fugitive Nazis which had previously been known for its anti-communist work and has now turned its focus to the Millennium Group.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Both a body {{of human}} {{knowledge}} and a knowledge/information system may be incomplete and inconsistent in many ways. Reasoning with incomplete and inconsistent knowledge/information is the rule {{rather than the exception}} in our everyday real-life situations and most scientific disciplines. Paraconsistent reasoning, or reasoning in the presence of inconsistency, is indispensable to <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery.</b> This paper intends to answer such a fundamental question: What kind of logic system can satisfactorily underlie paraconsistent reasoning in <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery?</b> We show why classical mathematical logic, its various classical conservative extensions, and traditional (weak) relevant logics cannot satisfactorily underlie paraconsistent reasoning in <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery,</b> and propose that one should adopt strong relevant logic as the fundamental logic to underlie paraconsistent reasoning in <b>scientific</b> <b>discovery...</b>|$|R
