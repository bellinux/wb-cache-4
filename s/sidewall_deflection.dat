5000|$|As with {{deformation}} of a spring, {{deformation of}} the tire contact patch generates a reaction {{force in the}} tire; the cornering force. Integrating the force generated by every tread element along the contact patch length gives the total cornering force. Although the term, [...] "tread element" [...] is used, the compliance in the tire that leads to this effect is actually a combination of <b>sidewall</b> <b>deflection</b> and deflection of the rubber within the contact patch. The exact ratio of sidewall compliance to tread compliance {{is a factor in}} tire construction and inflation pressure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sidewall</b> <b>deflection</b> is not {{a direct}} {{measurement}} of rolling friction. A high quality tire with a high quality (and supple) casing will allow for more flex per energy loss than a cheap tire with a stiff sidewall. Again, on a bicycle, a quality tire with a supple casing will still roll easier than a cheap tire with a stiff casing. Similarly, as noted by Goodyear truck tires, a tire with a [...] "fuel saving" [...] casing will benefit the fuel economy through many tread lives (i.e. retreading), while a tire with a [...] "fuel saving" [...] tread design will only benefit until the tread wears down.|$|E
40|$|The static {{performance}} of a jet exhaust nozzle which achieves multiaxis thrust vectoring by physically skewing the geometric throat has been characterized in the static test facility of the 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel at NASA Langley Research Center. The nozzle has an asymmetric internal geometry defined by four surfaces: a convergent-divergent upper surface with its ridge perpendicular to the nozzle centerline, a convergent-divergent lower surface with its ridge skewed relative to the nozzle centerline, an outwardly deflected sidewall, and a straight sidewall. The primary goal of the concept is to provide efficient yaw thrust vectoring by forcing the sonic plane (nozzle throat) to form at a yaw angle defined by the skewed ridge of the lower surface contour. A secondary goal is to provide multiaxis thrust vectoring by combining the skewed-throat yaw-vectoring concept with upper and lower pitch flap deflections. The geometric parameters varied in this investigation included lower surface ridge skew angle, nozzle expansion ratio (divergence angle), aspect ratio, pitch flap deflection angle, and <b>sidewall</b> <b>deflection</b> angle. Nozzle pressure ratio was varied from 2 {{to a high of}} 11. 5 for some configurations. The results of the investigation indicate that efficient, substantial multiaxis thrust vectoring was achieved by the skewed-throat nozzle concept. However, certain control surface deflections destabilized the internal flow field, which resulted in substantial shifts in the position and orientation of the sonic plane and had an adverse effect on thrust-vectoring and weight flow characteristics. By increasing the expansion ratio, the location of the sonic plane was stabilized. The asymmetric design resulted in interdependent pitch and yaw thrust vectoring as well as nonzero thrust-vector angles with undeflected control surfaces. By skewing the ridges of both the upper and lower surface contours, the interdependency between pitch and yaw thrust vectoring may be eliminated and the location of the sonic plane may be further stabilized...|$|E
40|$|An on-road {{analytical}} tire {{model has}} been developed to predict tire forces and moments at the tire/road interface. The model is computationally efficient and it only requires a limited set of easily obtained input parameters. Force and moment calculations are based on mechanical analogs that describe longitudinal and lateral tire tread and <b>sidewall</b> <b>deflections</b> during braking, traction and cornering. Longitudinal deflections are determined using a simple linear elastic spring model, while lateral deflections are calculated using an elastic beam model. Surface sliding friction is defined by experimental curves relating the friction coefficient to the wheel/road differential velocity. Source code has been developed to include the model as a force element subroutine in commercially available dynamic analysis software known as DADS (Dynamic Analysis Design System). The tire {{model has been}} successfully demonstrated in DADS using a simple simulation of a tire test device. Preliminary comparisons of model predictions with available test data have been favorable. Efforts are underway to incorporate the tire subroutine into a DADS model of a HMMWV to conduct driving simulations on dry, snow and ice covered road surfaces...|$|R
