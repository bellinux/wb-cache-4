6000|$|It {{was all so}} understandable--looked at in {{the proper}} light. It was all so {{impossible}} to explain. And why had <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> happen? Why had <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> happen? ...|$|E
60|$|His hand fell on hers. It comforted her chilly hand. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> lie there. Speech became {{difficult}} for her.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the first}} allusion they had made to the subject, but <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> take the {{argumentative}} form of her cogitations.|$|E
60|$|MRS. HOPE. Now Joy, {{come and}} sit down; your mother's been told tea's ready; if <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> get cold it's her lookout.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Roberts, {{relaxing}} into a chair: [...] "Then I simply {{never can}} hold up my head again." [...] <b>She</b> <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> fall in typical despair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, of course. There {{was never}} anybody about Four Winds could touch her for looks. Did {{you ever see}} her hair? It reaches to her feet when <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> down. But I meant how did you like her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yer kin begin duty by carryin' thet," [...] said Case, {{thrusting}} {{the package}} into Helen's arms. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> drop without moving a hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "So spoke Pilate," [...] {{broke in}} Cicely, lifting {{her head and}} looking him in the eyes. Then <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> fall again, and was silent.|$|E
6000|$|She {{lifted the}} sword, while, after a moment's prayer, I bared my {{neck of the}} silk robe. Then <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> fall again, gasping, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|She drags out {{a skinny}} little arm from a brown dustheap on the ground. Adjured {{not to disturb}} the child, <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> drop again. Thus we find at last {{that there is one}} child in the world of Entries who goes to bed--if this be bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I mean," [...] Charlotte {{instantly}} said. [...] "She's not selfish enough. There's nothing, absolutely, {{that one}} NEED do for her. She's so modest," [...] she developed--"she doesn't miss things. I {{mean if you}} love her--or, rather, I should say, if she loves you. <b>She</b> <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> go." ...|$|R
50|$|She {{appeared}} at Sydney's annual Carols in the Domain on 21 December where <b>she</b> sang <b>Let</b> <b>It</b> Go from Disney's Frozen.|$|R
6000|$|... "She did {{not finish}} her sentence, <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> rest there. I {{turned to her}} sweet face, and the balance of my mood swayed and reeled.|$|E
60|$|He {{held her}} hand pressed very tightly in his, tighter perhaps than {{conditions}} required, but <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> lie there as she led him forward, very slowly {{down a flight of}} rough stone steps.|$|E
60|$|Hannah ruminated. Cleverness as {{the modern}} {{substitute}} for feminine virtue did not appeal to her, but <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> pass. She {{was in no}} mood to quarrel with any quality that would ward off disgrace.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to put up with this," [...] he spluttered, [...] "not a day longer, do you hear, miss. Bless my soul, this is the third time, miss [...] . the third time! Patience has ceased to be a virtue, miss. I warned your aunt the last time not to <b>let</b> <b>it</b> occur again [...] . and <b>she's</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> [...] . <b>she's</b> done it [...] . what does she mean by it, that is what I want to know. That is what I'm here about, miss." ...|$|R
6000|$|He stopped panting at his mother's knees {{where she}} sat on the cabin {{threshold}} nearly as high as he stood. She put up her hand and pushed the wet hair from his forehead. [...] "How you do sweat, Joey! Go round and wash your face at the bench. Maybe Jane will give you a drink of the milk, while it's warm yet, before <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> down in the well. She's just through milkin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, pa. Fan, {{for all her}} slack ways, is a purty fair manager. She wouldn't waste <b>it.</b> <b>She</b> might <b>let</b> <b>it</b> run down, but she'd hang on to it." ...|$|R
60|$|Felix {{raised her}} white hand just once to his lips. It {{was the first}} time he had ever ventured to kiss her. He kissed it fervently. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> drop as if dead by her side.|$|E
6000|$|The word [...] "duty" [...] {{offended}} her, yet <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> pass. In his monstrous vanity it {{was often}} hopeless to make him appreciate the importance of anything or anybody outside of himself. Of this the present occasion was an instance.|$|E
60|$|She {{had drawn}} off her gloves, and one little hand, brown, shapely, rested upon her knee very near to me. I {{took it in}} mine. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> stay, though she looked away from me, the color rich in her cheeks.|$|E
50|$|Lori first {{arrives in}} Ramsay Street {{at the home}} of her boyfriend, Jack's parents. Within her first few hours at Number 26, she manages to offend Jack's mother, Lyn, with her {{straight}} talking and buying a coconut cake, even with the knowledge that Lyn does not like Coconut and causes further grief when <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> slip that Jack has given up on soccer after being dropped from his team in England and plans to work for her father in New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|Roy, {{who insists}} on working only {{short-term}} cons, resists the proposition, fearing she {{may try to}} dupe him herself. Myra, seeing Lilly's power over Roy, accuses him of having an incestuous interest in Lilly. Infuriated, Roy strikes her. Myra then plans her revenge. <b>She</b> <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> be known that Lilly has been stealing from Bobo {{over the years and}} stashing money in the trunk of her car. Lilly is warned by a friend and flees. Myra follows with the intention of killing her.|$|R
6000|$|Kate was complete. [...] "It's simply {{her absence}} of smallness. There is {{something}} in her above trifles. She generally trusts us; she doesn't propose to hunt us into corners; and if we frankly ask for a thing--why," [...] said Kate, [...] "she shrugs, but <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> go. <b>She</b> has really but one fault--she's indifferent, on such ground as she has taken about us, to details. However," [...] the girl cheerfully went on, [...] "it isn't in detail we fight her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you so much," [...] {{she said}} softly, giving his hand a last {{pressure}} before <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> go. He could not answer, so he sat down, bowing his head, then {{looking up at}} her in suspense. She smiled at her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fate {{will soon}} mend the wrong that fate has done--very soon now." [...] He took her hand, and, melted again from her dignity, <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> lie in his. [...] "When that is done, sweet, then will I claim you for my own." ...|$|E
60|$|He hesitated, {{with his}} hand upon a volume. She laughed at him and took it down herself. Perhaps she knew that her arm was shapely. At least <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> remain for a moment {{stretched}} out as though to reach the next volume.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know much}} about it, but from {{something}} <b>she</b> <b>let</b> drop <b>it</b> seems you've been saying some queer things in your letters to Antonia"; and again he looked at Shelton with his dry smile.|$|R
6000|$|Miss T. (In a stage whisper.) A twenty-four-inch waist, and <b>she</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>it</b> out. Where are my bangles? (Rummager on the toilet-table, and dabs at {{her hair}} with a brush in the interval.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} a retro rock 'n' roll {{offering}} with a 1950s flair. Sonia {{tells the story}} about how in love she is with her boyfriend, wishing he won't hurt her, for her love is true. <b>She</b> <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> known that <b>she</b> would [...] "sell her heart and soul" [...] to get his unconditional love in return, rationalising that it's better that one deal with [...] "the devil you know" [...] (him with his faults) instead of [...] "the devil you don't" [...] (another potential boyfriend).|$|R
60|$|She went {{straight}} to the place where the laudanum was hidden, and took it out. The bottle was so small that it lay easily in the palm of her hand. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> remain there for a little while, and stood looking at it.|$|E
6000|$|They {{had reached}} the point where Sally must part with the girl, who stopped to lift the top rail of the bars to the lane leading from the road to her father's cabin. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> drop again. [...] "Why, I'll go the whole way with you, Sally." ...|$|E
60|$|The knife {{was lying}} in her lap. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> slip into the fold of her dress, and laid her forearms with clasped fingers over her knees, which she pressed desperately together. The dreaded thing {{was out of sight}} at last. She felt a {{dampness}} break out all over her.|$|E
60|$|McEachern put {{his hand}} round her shoulders. <b>She</b> winced, but <b>let</b> <b>it</b> stay. He {{attempted}} gruff conciliation.|$|R
50|$|Later, Ren√©, Edith, Michelle, LeClerc and officer Crabtree are {{standing}} in the square, about to send the pigeon with the microfilm to England. When Michelle has attached the film to one of its legs, <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> go, but it keeps returning to them. It appears that LeClerc chose the wrong pigeon and took one, whose home place is in Nouvion. Michelle then has another idea. They will all enter the fishmonger float and specially prepare their carriage with propellers and engines, to paddle over to England in secret.|$|R
5000|$|Anderson-Lopez {{said that}} Lovato {{was chosen because}} of the singer's own {{personal}} life; [...] "She had a past that she's pretty open about {{that is similar to}} Elsa's journey of letting a dark past and fear behind and moving forward with your power." [...] Lovato indeed identified herself with the song's context, stating [...] "It's so relatable. Elsa is finding her identity; she's growing into who she is and she's finally accepting her own strength and magical powers. Instead of hiding it, like she's done all her life, <b>she's</b> <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> go and embracing it." ...|$|R
