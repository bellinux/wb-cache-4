5|$|The spiny scallop {{lives on}} the seabed in the <b>sublittoral</b> <b>zone</b> between low tide mark and a depth of , on soft {{sediment}} or on rock, particularly in areas with a strong current. It is a filter feeder, sieving microscopic algae from water that passes through its gills. It is preyed on by starfish, octopuses and sea otters. It can detect predators by smell and by sight and can swim away from them by opening and closing its valves. Other organisms often grow on the exterior of its shell and it often forms a symbiotic relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on the upper valve and helps protect it from predators.|$|E
25|$|S. balanoides {{can be the}} {{dominant}} species of rocky shores, where it grows {{in a range of}} situations, from very sheltered to very exposed. It is typically found lower on the shore than another barnacle, Chthamalus montagui, although with some overlap. S. balanoides can tolerate salinities down to 20psu, allowing it to colonise parts of estuaries. On semi-exposed shores, S. balanoides may form a patchwork with patches of seaweeds, such as Fucus serratus, and limpets; the fronds of the seaweeds brush the barnacle larvae from the rocks, allowing limpets to colonise it instead. At the southern limit of its range, including Cornwall, S. balanoides is replaced by Chthamalus montagui. Although capable of living in the <b>sublittoral</b> <b>zone,</b> S. balanoides tends to be restricted to the intertidal by predation and by competition from species such as the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, and the algae Ascophyllum nodosum and Chondrus crispus.|$|E
2500|$|Redspotted {{catsharks}} {{are born}} from [...] eggs that are fertilized and {{released into the}} water. There are typically two eggs in each capsule, which can also be called a mermaid's purse. Embryos feed on the yolk of the egg until they hatch. Once these eggs hatch, the sharks appear to be miniature versions of adults. However, the sharks grow rapidly. It is believed that juveniles swim into deeper waters {{in order to avoid}} predation in the <b>sublittoral</b> <b>zone</b> that they return to when they are adults. Therefore, there is a spatial segregation between adult and juvenile populations.|$|E

2500|$|More {{than one}} hundred taxa of single-cell pelagic algae have been {{identified}} around the archipelago, the most common being Thalassiosira antarctica and Chaetoceros decipiens. The bloom takes place between May and August. Of the roughly fifty species of zooplankton, calanoids dominate, with Calanus glacialis and Calanus hyperboreus constituting the greater portion of the biomass. On the sea bottom there are 34 species of macroalgae and at least 500 species of macrofauna. Most common are crustaceans such as amphipods and shrimps, polychaetes and echinoderms, such as sea bristles. The ice scouring causes there to be little life in the littoral zone, but the <b>sublittoral</b> <b>zone</b> (...) is dominated by laminaria, most commonly Laminaria sachcharina, and red algae, such as Phycodrys rubens.|$|E
2500|$|Giant isopods are {{important}} scavengers in the deep-sea benthic environment; they are mainly found from the gloomy <b>sublittoral</b> <b>zone</b> {{at a depth}} of [...] to the pitch darkness of the bathypelagic zone at , where pressures are high and temperatures are very low. A few species from this genus have been reported from shallower depths, notably B. miyarei between , the poorly known B. decemspinosus between [...] and B. doederleini as shallow as [...] The depth record for any giant isopod is [...] for B. kensleyi, but this species also occurs as shallow as [...] Over 80 percent of B. giganteus are found at a depth between [...] In regions with both [...] "giant" [...] and [...] "supergiant" [...] species, the former mainly live on the continental slope, while the latter mainly live on the bathyal plane. Although Bathynomus have been recorded in water as warm as , they are primarily found in much colder places. For example, during a survey of the deep sea fauna of Exuma Sound in The Bahamas, B. giganteus was found to be common in water between , but more abundant towards the lower temperature. In contrast, preliminary studies indicate that B. doederleinii stops feeding when the temperature falls below [...] This lower temperature limit may explain their absence from temperate and frigid regions where seas at the depth preferred by Bathynomus often are colder. They are thought to prefer a muddy or clay substrate and lead solitary lives.|$|E
