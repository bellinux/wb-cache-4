50|$|Softride was a {{manufacturer}} of bicycles located in Bellingham, Washington. They specialized in bicycles for triathletes. The bicycle frames were distinctive for their lack of <b>seat</b> <b>tubes</b> and chain stays. The idea was to reduce aerodynamic drag and improve ride comfort.

25|$|The great {{majority}} of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike. These upright bicycles almost always feature the diamond frame, a truss consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube, and <b>seat</b> <b>tube.</b> The head tube contains the headset, the set of bearings that allows the fork to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the bottom bracket. The rear triangle consists of the <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket to the rear dropout, where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect {{the top of the}} <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.|$|E

40|$|Presented in {{this paper}} is a new method for design {{analysis}} of bicycle frames. The new method relies on measurements of rider i n d u d loading to perform a stress analysis of a bicycle frame. The vehicle for the stress analysis is ANSYS, a commercially available finite element code. Through application of individual measured loads, the method examines the corresponding nodes of maximum stress. Polar plots are developed to illustrate the variation of stress {{as a function of}} crank arm angle. Polar plots are also developed for the nodes experiencing the maximum total stress. Such a procedure enables the contribution of individual measured loads to the maximum stress to be ascertained. With this information, not only are the important loads for design analysis identified, but also the structural members of relalive high and low stress are determined. Accordingly, these results have application to the detailed design of individual structural members. To illustrate the new method, stress analysis of an aluminum frame is undertaken. The loading data are derived from an earlier study by the authors where significant seat, handlebar, and pedal loads were measured together with absolute pedal position. The loading data simulate that of steady-state cycling over Rat terrain at about 9 m/s (20 mile/hr). The node of maximum total stress under steady-state loading is found to be the intersection of the top and <b>seat</b> <b>tubes.</b> Inasmuch as frames typically fail {{in the area of the}} bottom bracket (i. e., intersection of down and <b>seat</b> <b>tubes),</b> this result contradicts experience. This contradiction is explained by observing that the alternating stress/mea...|$|R

25|$|Road racing {{bicycles}} {{that are used}} in UCI-sanctioned races are governed by UCI regulations, which state among other things that the frame must consist of two triangles. Hence designs that lack a <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> or top tube are not allowed.|$|E
25|$|Recently, a {{variation}} of the traditional seat stay that bypasses the <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> and connects further into the top tube was patented by Volagi Cycles. This frame element added length to the traditional design of seat stays, making a softer ride at the sacrifice of frame stiffness.|$|E
5000|$|Montague Corporation {{was formed}} in 1987 by David Montague, while in {{graduate}} school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with his father Harry Montague. Harry, a Washington, D.C. architect and inventor, developed the original design for the Montague full-size folding bike {{as a result of}} his need for a portable bike that would fit his 6'2" [...] frame. That first bicycle designed by Montague was dubbed the [...] "Montague BiFrame" [...] for its patented Concentrus system, which unites the two parts of the frame with concentric <b>seat</b> <b>tubes,</b> one nested inside the other. This system allows a bike with a full-size wheel and frame to fold in half without cutting any structural tubes, maintaining the structural integrity of the bike. Montague bikes were designed using industry standard parts, including full-size wheels, a departure from other folding bike makers use of more proprietary parts and small wheels in order to make the frames more compact.|$|R

50|$|Key West Rapids is a one-or-two person {{water slide}} at Adventure Island in Tampa, Florida, {{operated}} by SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment. The 700 ft.-long slide takes its riders, <b>seated</b> on <b>tubes,</b> down {{a course that}} includes gushers, pools, water mines, and 3 terraces of water, that slow the tubes to a near halt so that staffers can redirect the tubes down {{the remainder of the}} course.|$|R
25|$|Track frames {{have much}} in common with road and time trial frames, but come with rear-facing, {{horizontal}} fork ends, rather than dropouts, to allow one to adjust the position of the rear wheel horizontally to set the proper chain tension. Also the <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> angle is steeper than on road racing bikes.|$|E
25|$|In a {{cantilever}} {{bicycle frame}} the seat stays continue past the seat post and curve downwards {{to meet with}} the down tube. Cantilever frames are popular on the cruiser bicycle, the lowrider bicycle, and the wheelie bike. In many cantilever frames the only straight tubes are the <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> and the head tube.|$|E
25|$|Road {{bicycles}} for racing {{tend to have}} a steeper <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> angle, {{measured from}} the horizontal plane. This positions the rider aerodynamically and arguably in a stronger stroking position. The trade-off is comfort. Touring and comfort bicycles tend to have more slack <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> angle traditionally. This positions the rider more on the sit bones and takes weight off the wrists, arms and neck, and, for men, improves circulation to the urinary and reproductive areas. With a slacker angle, designers lengthen the chainstay so that the center of gravity (that would otherwise be farther to the back over the wheel) is more ideally repositioned over the middle of the bike frame. The longer wheelbase contributes to effective shock absorption. In modern mass-manufactured touring and comfort bikes, the seat-tube angle is negligibly slacker, perhaps in order to reduce manufacturing costs by avoiding the need to reset welding jigs in automated processes, and thus do not provide the comfort of traditionally made or custom-made frames which do have noticeably slacker seat-tube angles.|$|E

25|$|Combining {{different}} {{materials can}} provide the desired stiffness, compliance, or damping in different areas better than can be accomplished with a single material. The combined materials are usually carbon fiber and a metal, either steel, aluminum, or titanium. One implementation of this approach includes a metal down tube and chain stays with carbon top tube, <b>seat</b> <b>tube,</b> and seat stays. Another is a metal main triangle and chain stays with just carbon seat stays.|$|E
25|$|Historically, women's bicycle frames had a {{top tube}} that {{connected}} {{in the middle}} of the <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> instead of the top, resulting in a lower standover height. This was to allow the rider to dismount while wearing a skirt or dress. The design has since been used in utility bikes to facilitate easy mounting and dismounting for both genders, and is also known as a step-through frame or an open frame. Another style that accomplishes similar results is the mixte.|$|E
25|$|The {{bottom bracket}} shell is a short and large {{diameter}} tube, relative to the other tubes in the frame, that runs side to side and holds the bottom bracket. It is usually threaded, often left-hand threaded on the right (drive) side of the bike to prevent loosening by fretting induced precession, and right-hand threaded on the left (non-drive) side. There are many variations, such as an eccentric bottom bracket, which allows for adjustment in tension of the bicycle's chain. It is typically larger, unthreaded, and sometimes split. The chain stays, <b>seat</b> <b>tube,</b> and down tube all typically connect to the {{bottom bracket shell}}.|$|E
40|$|Traveling with a {{full size}} bicycle can be problematic. A light weight bicycle frame was {{designed}} to collapse {{to be able to}} fit into carry-on luggage for transport on an airplane. The required dimensions of the suitcase are 22 by 14 by 9 inches. This bicycle was also designed to be able to sustain a load of 200 pounds, with minimal deflection throughout the frame. The frame was constructed using aluminum 6061 -T 6 tubes that were cut to a specific size to be used for telescoping tubes along the front triangle of the frame, known as the top, down, and <b>seat</b> <b>tubes.</b> The telescoping tubes are pin locked when extended to ensure the structural integrity of the frame. These hitch pins were selected due to the ball bearing {{at the end of the}} pin, which helps keep the pin in place while the bicycle is being used. The frame along the chain and seat stays of the frame use pin locking tube hinges. These hinges were specifically chosen for this project so that they could assist in easily collapsing the bicycle, while keeping the structural integrity of the bike intact. The designed frame was not to exceed 15 pounds and the finished product was successful, weighing in at less than 13 pounds. While the dimensions of the frame are 38 by 22 by 6 inches when fully extended, the final dimensions of the frame when it is collapsed are 22 by 14 by 5 inches. Other results include load and deflection testing...|$|R
