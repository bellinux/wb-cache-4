40|$|Abstract—A {{common mode}} of limb {{suspension}} for transtibial amputees is the pin liner/shuttle lock system. Despite its popu-larity, some clinicians question its use because of observed daily and chronic {{changes to the}} residual limb. For this study, we measured limb interface pressures during ambulation with <b>pin</b> and suction <b>suspension</b> systems. No pressure differences were seen between the modes of suspension during stance phase. However, during swing phase, <b>pin</b> <b>suspension</b> main-tained an average occlusive compressive pressure of 6. 7 kPa on the proximal tissues, {{as compared to the}} subocclusive pressure of 1. 1 kPa with suction <b>suspension.</b> Simultaneously, <b>pin</b> sus-pension elevated the peak magnitude of suction to – 39. 5 kPa at the distal residual limb, compared to – 26. 1 kPa with suction suspension. During swing phase, the pin liner squeezes proxi-mally while creating a large suction distally on the residual limb and is the likely cause of daily and chronic skin changes observed in pin users.

50|$|Across Puerto Rico, {{heavy rains}} caused {{extensive}} damage to roads while hurricane-force winds toppled many trees and utility poles, leaving more than 1 million residences without power. President Barack Obama {{declared a state}} of emergency. About 121,000 customers were cut off from potable water service {{at the height of the}} storm, and islandwide at least 771 people had to take shelter. At higher elevations, winds estimated by radar neared 111 mph (178 km/h). The highest amounts of precipitation fell across eastern parts of the territory; in Gurabo, a peak total of 22.04 in was recorded. Several rivers burst their banks as a consequence of the rains, causing additional flooding. The agricultural sector also suffered losses from the storm, particularly near the location of landfall. High winds uprooted crop plants, and several coffee and banana plantations sustained minor damage. Of the plantations, the most affected were situated in Yabucoa and Maunabo, where severe flooding washed out copious amounts of banana crop. The rains continued to fall for hours into the wake of the storm, prompting the issuance of flood watches. In total, Irene affected over 1,500 people in Puerto Rico, and one driver was killed after their vehicle was caught in swollen currents. Preliminary estimates indicate structural damage could be as high as $500 million (USD), with additional losses due to the three-day labor <b>suspensions</b> <b>pinned</b> at over $60.4 million (USD).Offshore near Culebra Island, a sailboat was reported sunken due to rough seas prior to landfall in mainland Puerto Rico. Gale-force winds felled fences and shattered windows, with a flying object piercing through one residence. A total of 46 locals sought refuge to ride out the storm, but one family required post-storm shelter after the roof to their home was lost. On the island of Vieques, similar sustained winds of 51 mph (85 km/h) were recorded, as well as some gusts of up to 71 mph (115 km/h). Some power and telephone service cutoffs were reported, and the island's airport halted its operations.|$|R

40|$|Current {{literature}} {{focusing on}} the prosthetic socket is limited by measurement techniques and modeling assumptions, leading to a limited understanding of the forces and motions occurring between the residual limb and prosthesis {{and how they can}} be used to influence socket design and fitting. Prosthetic socket fitting and prescription would benefit from an elegant method for comparing socket designs. This dissertation focuses on {{the development and implementation of}} a 3 D motion capture model and a Slip Detection Sensor to quantify rotations and translations at the prosthetic socket-residual limb interface. The 3 D motion capture model defines the residual limb bone position inside the prosthetic socket which allows for measurement of the movement occurring at the prosthetic socket interface. The Slip Detection Sensor is an optoelectronic sensor embedded into the prosthetic socket wall to measure the amount of socket slip occurring between the socket wall and the residual limb skin surface. The motion capture model and Slip Detection Sensor were used to measure motion at the socket interface of transhumeral amputees during activities of daily living. Data were collected on six transhumeral amputees in the University of South Florida 2 ̆ 7 s (USF) motion analysis laboratory. One of the participants completed the collection procedures twice using two different <b>suspension</b> systems (<b>pin</b> locking versus no pin locking) within the same socket. An eight camera Vicon (Oxord, UK) motion capture system was used to collect kinematic data for each participant during the repetition of a series of range of motion (RoM) and activities of daily living (ADL). The RoM tasks included shoulder flexion/extension, shoulder abduction/adduction, shoulder rotation, and elbow flexion. The ADL tasks included a bilateral and unilateral lifting task at various weight increments, modified box and blocks test, folding a towel, and walk and carry a gallon jug of water. The impact of donning the prosthesis on the participant 2 ̆ 7 s RoM and the amount of socket movement during the ADL tasks was analyzed. The results show that the participant 2 ̆ 7 s shoulder RoM significantly decreased while wearing their prosthesis compared to when they were not wearing their prosthesis. The anterior-posterior tilt, medial-lateral tilt, and socket vertical translation were more directly correlated with the amount of residual limb movement than with the force acting on the prosthetic hand. Socket slip was most directly correlated with the force acting on the prosthetic hand. The results also show that the amount of translation was reduced when the <b>pin</b> locking <b>suspension</b> was used compared to when it wasn 2 ̆ 7 t for the individual participant who used both suspension systems within the same socket. The motion capture data were used to determine the amount of socket movement during activities of daily living while avoiding many of the limitations of other socket interface studies. The Slip Detection Sensor provided experimental data on the amount of slip occurring between the residual limb skin surface and socket wall. This method seems to be a useful tool for evaluating socket performance in terms of movement. Ultimately, socket interface movement data can be used to providing clinicians with quantitative results of a good socket fit to aid in the socket fitting and prescription process and incorporated into adjustable interfaces. Collection of data on more participants with various socket types is needed to make more general conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Background Lower-limb {{prostheses}} enable life participation {{for people}} with amputation. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} total surface bearing (TSB) compared with specific surface bearing (SSB) prosthesis designs on health outcomes. Inclusion criteria Types of participants Trans-tibial amputees aged 14 years and older utilising a TSB or SSB prosthesis. Types of interventions and comparators The intervention was the TSB and the comparator was the SSB design. Types of studies This review considered all relevant quantitative study designs. Outcomes and outcome measures Outcome measures relating to function and mobility, comfort and pain, quality of life and energy expenditure were considered. Search strategy A three-step search strategy across 13 databases and discipline-specific resources was pursued. Published and unpublished studies in English were considered, from database inception to June 2012. Methodological quality Two independent reviewers, using the Joanna Briggs Institute MAStARI appraisal checklists, undertook critical appraisal. Data collection Data about interventions, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance were extracted using the MAStARI tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data synthesis Quantitative data was pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the Cochrane Review Manager Version 5. 2 where possible. Where not possible, findings were presented using narrative and tables. Results This review identified and analysed 28 measures assessing the health domains, presenting mixed findings. Twenty-one measures found no difference between socket designs; four found a significant difference favouring the TSB and three found a significant difference favouring the SSB design. Suspension and interface variation was found. Sub-group analysis assessed TSB with gel interface and SSB with foam interface, to examine interface influence. Four measures found no difference and two measures, walking speed and cadence, found a significant difference favouring the TSB design. Further sub-group analysis assessing the influence of <b>pin</b> <b>suspension</b> with TSB compared to supra-condylar suspension with SSB found significant difference favouring TSB design for walking speed and socket preference outcomes. Conclusions The available evidence on the effectiveness of prosthetic socket designs suggests no clear choice between the TSB and SSB. This may be due to variation in interface and suspension utilised. Interpreting the findings, the TSB was as effective as the SSB design in improving health outcomes relating to function, comfort and quality of life. Implications for Practice In finding that the TSB is as effective as the SSB design in improving health outcomes implies that prescription may depend on clinician knowledge and skill-set, funding availability and patient preference. Prosthetists require the skill-set to deliver the TSB design. TSB prescription involves a gel interface, with additional costs; therefore funding is required to enable this prescription. Implications for Research Additional high quality studies involving a larger sample size, across aetiologies are required. Consistency in measures is critical to facilitate comparison and enhance meta-analysis. Studies on cost-effectiveness of socket designs are required to inform choice from a societal perspective.
