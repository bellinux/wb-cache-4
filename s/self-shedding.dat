40|$|Flying in icing {{conditions}} {{is a real}} hazard for aircraft as they can undergo potential disastrous increase in drag, reduction in maximum lift which {{lead to an increase}} in fuel consumption. Additionally pitot tubes and other sensors can become blocked or their operation compromised. Ice shed {{from other parts of the}} aircraft can enter the engine and lead to blade damage. Whilst ice protection systems are comonly used on propellers, the potential benefit of applying them to a fan have not, as yet, been considered suffi cient to o set the cost and energy penalties of such system. As engines become larger, it is more diffi cult to contain ice and <b>self-shedding</b> becomes an increasing hazard for the nacelle and other parts downstream of the fan. The main objectives of the project were to determine the mechanical proper- ties of ice such as might form on an engine fan, in order to help Rolls-Royce in building a finite elements model able to simulate ice shedding from fan blades. Lots were written about ice however only little information about the mechanical properties of impact ice was available in the literature and the values which were, were generally not applicable in the case of aeroengine in {{icing conditions}}. According to the literature and from Rolls-Royce photos and films of ice shedding from fan blades, <b>self-shedding</b> mechanisms were ruled by adhesive shear strength and tensile strength. Therefore, the experimental part of the project consisted of measuring these two mechanical properties as well as the density, the sti ness and the grain size of ice grown on titanium substrate. Two test rigs were used to measure the mechanical properties: the I" and the " test rig. The mode I test rig was already available and was only modified in order to test more specimens during each run. This test al- lowed to measure the pressure needed to remove the ice from the substrate in a running icing tunnel. Using equations from the literature, fracture energy, fracture toughness and tensile strength were calculated. The influence of ambient total temperature, cloud liquid water content and tunnel wind speed were investigated. Tensile strength was found to be increasing as the total temperature is decreasing, decreasing as the LWC is increasing and going trough a maximum as the tunnel wind speed is increasing. Values obtained lied in the range from 0. 6 to 1. 5 J. m- 2 (corresponding to between 2 and 10 MPa) which is, in general, higher than the ones reported by other authors. This difference can be explained by the fact that the mode I test was conducted in a running icing tunnel while the previous authors have conducted the mechanical test after the tunnel has been stopped. In parallel, finite element models have been developed and results similar to the experiments were obtained [...] . [cont. ]...|$|E
40|$|Dropwise {{condensation}} {{of atmospheric}} water vapor {{is important in}} multiple practical engineering applications. The roles of environmental factors and surface morphology/chemistry on the condensation dynamics need to be better understood to enable efficient water-harvesting, dehumidication, and other psychrometric processes. Systems and surfaces that promote faster condensation rates and <b>self-shedding</b> of condensate droplets could lead to improved mass transfer rates and higher water yields in harvesting applications. The thesis presents the design and construction of an experimental facility that allows visualization of the condensation process {{as a function of}} relative humidity. Dropwise condensation experiments are performed on a vertically oriented, hydrophobic surface at a controlled relative humidity and surface subcooling temperature. The distribution and growth of water droplets are monitored across the surface at different relative humidities (45 %, 50 %, 55 %, and 70 %) at a constant surface subcooling temperature of 15 Â°C below the ambient temperature. The droplet growth dynamics exhibits a strong dependency on relative humidity in the early stages during which there is a large population of small droplets on the surface and single droplet growth dominates over coalescence effects. At later stages, the dynamics of droplet growth is insensitive to relative humidity due to the dominance of coalescence effects. The overall volumetric rate of condensation on the surface is also assessed as a function of time and ambient relative humidity. Low relative humidity conditions not only slow the absolute rate of condensation, but also prolong an initial transient regime over which the condensation rate remains significantly below the steady-state value. The current state-of-the-art in dropwise condensation research indicates the need for systematic experimental investigations as a function of relative humidity. The improved understanding of the relative humidity effects on the growth of single and distributed droplets offered in this thesis can improve the prediction of heat and mass transfer during dropwise condensation of humid air under differing environmental conditions. This knowledge can be used to engineer condenser systems and surfaces that are adapted for local ambient relative humidity and temperature conditions. ...|$|E
