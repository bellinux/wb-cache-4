5|$|Those at {{high risk}} of {{infection}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> as there is effective treatment for those who have the disease. Groups that screening is recommended for include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following: people from areas of the world where hepatitis B occurs in more than 2%, those with HIV, intravenous drug users, {{men who have sex with}} men, and those who live with someone with hepatitis B.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> for herpes.|$|E

25|$|The {{most useful}} drugs (INH and RMP) <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> first, because {{the absence of}} these drugs from a {{treatment}} regimen severely impairs its efficacy.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, the Swiss Aquatic Research Institute, Eawag, has {{a method}} by which hazard maps could be {{produced}} for geogenic toxic substances in groundwater. This provides an efficient way of determining which wells <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested.</b>|$|E
25|$|The drugs {{most likely}} to be causing the {{reaction}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> as late as possible (and possibly need not be tested at all). This avoids rechallenging patients with a drug to which they have already had a (possibly) dangerous adverse reaction.|$|E
25|$|People with a {{significant}} family history for ovarian cancer are often referred to a genetic counselor {{to see if they}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> for BRCA mutations. The use of oral contraceptives, the absence of 'periods' during the menstrual cycle, and tubal ligation reduce the risk.|$|E

25|$|Pica in dogs {{may be a}} sign of Immune-mediated {{hemolytic}} anemia, {{especially when}} it involves eating substances such as tile grout, concrete dust, and sand.

25|$|Fire safety {{experts said}} the tests the {{government}} is doing on cladding only are insufficient as the whole unit of cladding and insulation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> including fire stops.

25|$|Traditionally, gonorrhea was {{diagnosed}} with gram stain and culture; however, newer polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing methods are becoming more common. In those failing initial treatment, culture {{should be done to}} determine sensitivity to antibiotics. All people testing positive for gonorrhea <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus.|$|E

25|$|A {{study in}} Sweden {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} environmental factors on NMDs. The study indicated {{that there might be}} an impact of low or subnormal maternal BMI before and during pregnancy, maternal infection, such as rubella, and maternal smoking on fetal brain development, including neuronal migration. The roles of maternal BMI and congenital infections <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> in future analytical studies.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, the {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) {{signs and}} symptoms of aHUS overlap with those of STEC-HUS. Stool samples from patients with diarrhea or other GI symptoms <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> for STEC and the presence of Shiga-toxin. However, a positive identification of Shiga-toxin, which is required to diagnose STEC-HUS, does not rule out aHUS. Nevertheless, in the appropriate clinical setting, a positive identification of Shiga-toxin makes aHUS very unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Peter {{decided that}} all of the {{children}} of the nobility should have some early education, especially in the areas of sciences. Therefore, on 28 February 1714, he issued a decree calling for compulsory education, which dictated that all Russian 10- to 15-year-old children of the nobility, government clerks, and lesser-ranked officials, must learn basic mathematics and geometry, and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> on it {{at the end of their}} studies.|$|E

50|$|When the United States {{moved into}} World War I, Robert M.

Yerkes and his colleagues developed the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests to use on all new recruits. These tests set a precedent for the development of psychological testing for the next several decades.|$|R
