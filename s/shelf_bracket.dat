6000|$|Mr. Tartar’s {{chambers}} {{were the}} neatest, the cleanest, and the best-ordered chambers ever seen under the sun, moon, and stars. The floors were scrubbed to that extent, {{that you might}} have supposed the London blacks emancipated for ever, and gone out of the land for good. Every inch of brass-work in Mr. Tartar’s possession was polished and burnished, till it shone like a brazen mirror. No speck, nor spot, nor spatter soiled the purity of any of Mr. Tartar’s household gods, large, small, or middle-sized. His sitting-room was like the admiral’s cabin, his bath-room was like a dairy, his sleeping-chamber, fitted all about with lockers and drawers, was like a seedsman’s shop; and his nicely-balanced cot just stirred in the midst, as if it breathed. Everything belonging to Mr. Tartar had quarters of its own assigned to it: his maps and charts had their quarters; his books had theirs; his brushes had theirs; his boots had theirs; his clothes had theirs; his case-bottles had theirs; his telescopes and other instruments had theirs. Everything was readily accessible. <b>Shelf,</b> <b>bracket,</b> locker, hook, and drawer were equally within reach, and were equally contrived with a view to avoiding waste of room, and providing some snug inches of stowage for something that would have exactly fitted nowhere else. His gleaming little service of plate was so arranged upon his sideboard as that a slack salt-spoon would have instantly betrayed itself; his toilet implements were so arranged upon his dressing-table as that a toothpick of slovenly deportment could have been reported at a glance. So with the curiosities he had brought home from various voyages. Stuffed, dried, repolished, or otherwise preserved, according to their kind; birds, fishes, reptiles, arms, articles of dress, shells, seaweeds, grasses, or memorials of coral reef; each was displayed in its especial place, and each could have been displayed in no better place. Paint and varnish seemed to be kept somewhere out of sight, in constant readiness to obliterate stray finger-marks wherever any might become perceptible in Mr. Tartar’s chambers. No man-of-war was ever kept more spick and span from careless touch. On this bright summer day, a neat awning was rigged over Mr. Tartar’s flower-garden as only a sailor can rig it, and there was a sea-going air upon the whole effect, so delightfully complete, that the flower-garden might have appertained to stern-windows afloat, and the whole concern might have bowled away gallantly with all on board, if Mr. Tartar had only clapped to his lips the speaking-trumpet that was slung in a corner, and given hoarse orders to heave the anchor up, look alive there, men, and get all sail upon her! ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering a bracket is any intermediate component for fixing one part to another, usually larger, part. What makes a bracket a bracket {{is that it}} is intermediate between the two and fixes the one to the other. Brackets vary widely in shape, but a prototypical bracket is the L-shaped metal piece that attaches a shelf (the smaller component) to a wall (the larger component): its vertical arm is fixed to one (usually large) element, and its horizontal arm protrudes outwards and holds another (usually small) element. This <b>shelf</b> <b>bracket</b> is effectively the same as the architectural bracket: a vertical arm mounted on the wall, and a horizontal arm projecting outwards for another element to be attached on top of it or below it. To enable the outstretched arm to support a greater weight, a bracket will often have a third arm running diagonally between the horizontal and vertical arms, or indeed the bracket may be a solid triangle. By extension almost any object that performs this function of attaching one part to another (usually larger) component is also called a bracket, even though it may not be obviously L-shaped. Common examples that are often not really L-shaped at all but attach a smaller component to a larger and are still called brackets are the components that attach a bicycle lamp to a bicycle, and the rings that attach pipes to walls.|$|E
40|$|NASA JSC {{has been}} {{involved}} in the development of Laser sensors {{for the past ten years}} in order to support future rendezvous and docking missions, both manned and unmanned. Although many candidate technologies have been breadboarded and evaluated, no sensor hardware designed specifically for rendezvous and docking applications has been demonstrated on-orbit. It has become apparent that representative sensors need to be flown and demonstrated as soon as possible, with minimal cost, to provide the capability of the technology in meeting NASA's future AR&C applications. Technology and commercial component reliability have progressed to where it is now feasible to fly hardware as a detailed test objective minimizing the overall cost and development time. This presentation will discuss the ongoing effort to convert an existing in-house developed breadboard to an engineering model configuration suitable for flight. The modifications include improving the ranger resolution and stability with an in-house design, replacing the rack mounted galvanometric scanner drivers with STD-bus cards, replacing the system controlling personal computer with a microcontroller, and repackaging the subsystems as appropriate. The sensor will use the performance parameters defined in previous JSC requirements working groups as design goals and be built to withstand the space environment where fiscally feasible. Testing of the in-house ranger design is expected to be completed in October. The results will be included in the presentation. Preliminary testing of the ranging circuitry indicates a range resolution of 4 mm is possible. The sensor will be mounted in the payload bay on a <b>shelf</b> <b>bracket</b> and have command, control, and display capabilities using the payload general support computer via an RS 422 data line...|$|E

Dim forms in bronze and plaster stood on <b>shelves,</b> <b>brackets,</b> and pedestals, {{and at the end}} of the long room a big group of figures writhed as if in mortal combat. It was a work-shop--that was evident even to her--with one small nook devoted to tea and talk.|$|R
30|$|In this study, it {{was aimed}} to {{increase}} {{the strength of the}} weakest part that is located at the joint between the back post and side rail. The weak part affected the front to back load of chairs. The front to back load depends on the chair frames. The component parts with joint types are less strong than without joint. Stretcher types (box stretcher and cross stretcher) and wood <b>shelf</b> <b>brackets</b> were used to reinforce chair frames.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{fracture}} {{occurs in the}} joints of wooden structures. The joints are often reinforced with adhesive, stretcher, and <b>shelf</b> <b>brackets.</b> However, {{it is better to}} remove or reduce the number of joints. For this purpose, curved wood can be used instead to the jointed frame. In this study, chairs with curved frames were compared with conventional design. The aim of the study includes the use of reinforced frame and reduces the joints of frame for improving the quality of chairs.|$|R

Custom mounts are {{specially}} created to the exact dimensions, weight, and any specific stability or support issues {{in response to the}} preservation and conservation of a particular object. The type and design of each custom mount is also determined by the budget and skill of the mount maker. In contrast, generic mounts require only rough measurements of the object. These general or prefabricated <b>shelves,</b> <b>brackets,</b> or stock forms can be purchased from museum or archival supply companies.|$|R

There were vases, and figures of men and animals, and graven platters and bowls, and mosaics of precious gems, and many other things. Pictures, too, were on the walls, and the underground palace was quite a museum of rare and curious and costly objects.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCordierite based {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in high temperature applications due to their good thermo-mechanical properties and thermal shock resistance. They are generally employed in the kiln furniture (<b>shelves,</b> <b>brackets,</b> bearing plates) for firing ceramic pieces. Because of its low expansion coefficient and dielectric properties, cordierite is also used in advanced ceramics, catalyst supports automotive, industrial waste gas purification and parts subjected to sudden temperature changes. The low intrinsic strength of the cordierite may be compensated {{by the presence of}} mullite, forming a composite material of cordierite-mullite, extending its use to somewhat higher temperatures, at the expense of a slight increase in the thermal expansion coefficient. In this work a cordierite-mullite precursor was prepared from a mixture of magnesium oxide, calcined alumina, silica fume and monoaluminum phosphate solution that produces fast setting at room temperature (∼ 20 minutes) and then, by calcination, cordierite-mullite is generated. The evolution of the mineralogical phases was studied from room temperature to 1350 °C by X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetry. A possible sequence of chemicals reactions throughout the heat treatment is also proposed. Adding refractory aggregates to this precursor leads to obtaining a fast-setting concrete, suitable for the formation of individual pieces or repair service at moderately high temperatures. A summary of its main properties is also included...|$|R

50|$|Ganoderma is a genus of polypore {{mushrooms}} {{that grow}} on wood, and include about 80 species, many from tropical regions. Because of their extensive use in traditional Asian medicines, {{and their potential}} in bioremediation, they are a very important genus economically. Ganoderma can be differentiated from other polypores {{because they have a}} double-walled basidiospore. They are popularly referred to as <b>shelf</b> mushrooms or <b>bracket</b> fungi.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{bracket fungi}} {{are defined by}} their growth form rather than phylogeny, the group {{contains}} members of multiple clades. Although the term classically was reserved for polypores, molecular studies have revealed some odd relationships. The beefsteak fungus, a well-known bracket fungus, is actually {{a member of the}} agarics. Other examples of bracket fungi include the sulphur <b>shelf,</b> birch <b>bracket,</b> dryad's saddle, artist's conk, and turkey tail. The name polypores is often used for a group that includes many of the hard or leathery fungi, which often lack a stipe, growing straight out of wood. [...] "Polypore" [...] is derived from the Greek words poly, meaning [...] "much" [...] or [...] "many", and poros, meaning [...] "pore".|$|R

Concurrently, Wegg perceives a pretty little dead bird lying on the counter, with its head drooping on one side against the rim of Mr Venus's saucer, and a long stiff wire piercing its breast. As if it were Cock Robin, {{the hero of the}} ballad, and Mr Venus were the sparrow with his bow and arrow, and Mr Wegg were the fly with his little eye.|$|R

50|$|Cliffwood Hall {{is located}} on the {{southwest}} side of Rebel Hill Road (Maine State Route 180), a short way south of its junction with Maine State Route 9. It stands next to the Harold Allan Schoolhouse, also owned by the local historical society. The hall is a two story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, granite foundation, and modest Italianate styling. The front facade is symmetrical, with a central double door sheltered by a <b>bracketed</b> <b>shelf,</b> and single sash windows on either side. Above the doors are a pair of tall sash windows, flanked on the side bays by single tall windows, and there are a pair of normal-height sash windows in the attic level. The windows are all topped by projecting cornices. The downstairs of the interior has an entry vestibule, kitchen, and main hall, the latter now housing museum exhibits that include the old town hearse. The upstairs of the hall is unfinished except for its pine floor.|$|R
60|$|The ostler remounted his horse, and {{the others}} followed. The trail {{presently}} turned into a broader track, that bore some signs of approaching habitations, {{and at the end}} of five minutes they came upon a clearing. It was part of one of the fragmentary mountain terraces, and formed by itself a vast niche, or <b>bracketed</b> <b>shelf,</b> in the hollow flank of the mountain that, to Hale's first glance, bore a rude resemblance to Eagle's Court. But there was neither meadow nor open field; the few acres of ground had been wrested from the forest by axe and fire, and unsightly stumps everywhere marked the rude and difficult attempts at cultivation. Two or three rough buildings of unplaned and unpainted boards, connected by rambling sheds, stood in the centre of the amphitheatre. Far from being protected by the encircling rampart, it seemed to be the selected arena for the combating elements. A whirlwind from the outer abyss continually filled this cave of AEolus with driving snow, which, however, melted as it fell, or was quickly whirled away again.|$|R

On the west wall of the room is a door, which exits onto the rear porch. On the second floor, there is a narrow hall on the west side of the stairs. On the west side of the hall, on the south side of the house, there is a guest room. This, the house's largest bedroom, has <b>bracketed</b> <b>shelves,</b> {{intended}} for the display of objects. It is the only room in the house with this feature. On the west side of the hall is a walk-in closet, the only closet in the house. On the east side of the hall are two other bedrooms. The room to the west were used for laundry, dyeing, and other domestic activities. The south and east walls of this room, originally exterior walls have clapboard siding. There is no ceiling; rafters and roof sheathing can be seen overhead. The floor is wood.|$|R

6000|$|When he {{had told}} her that if she would take him as he was he should be very happy to dine with her, she excused herself a moment and went to give an order in the dining-room. The young man, left alone, looked about the parlour--the two parlours which, in their prolonged, {{adjacent}} narrowness, formed evidently one apartment--and wandered to the windows at the back, where there was a view of the water; Miss Chancellor having the good fortune to dwell on that side of Charles Street toward which, in the rear, the afternoon sun slants redly, from an horizon indented at empty intervals with wooden spires, the masts of lonely boats, the chimneys of dirty [...] "works," [...] over a brackish expanse of anomalous character, which is too big for a river and too small for a bay. The view seemed to him very picturesque, though in the gathered dusk little was left of it save a cold yellow streak in the west, a gleam of brown water, and the reflexion of the lights that had begun to show themselves in a row of houses, impressive to Ransom in their extreme modernness, which overlooked the same lagoon from a long embankment on the left, constructed of stones roughly piled. He thought this prospect, from a city-house, almost romantic; and he turned from it back to the interior illuminated now by a lamp which the parlour-maid had placed on a table while he stood at the window as to something still more genial and interesting. The artistic sense in Basil Ransom had not been highly cultivated; neither (though he had passed his early years as the son of a rich man) was his conception of material comfort very definite; it consisted mainly of the vision of plenty of cigars and brandy and water and newspapers, and a cane-bottomed arm-chair of the right inclination, from which he could stretch his legs. Nevertheless it seemed to him he had never seen an interior that was so much an interior as this queer corridor-shaped drawing-room of his new-found kinswoman; he had never felt himself in the presence of so much organised privacy or of so many objects that spoke of habits and tastes. Most of the people he had hitherto known had no tastes; they had a few habits, but these were not of a sort that required much upholstery. He had not as yet been in many houses in New York, and he had never before seen so many accessories. The general character of the place struck him as Bostonian; this was, in fact, very much what he had supposed Boston to be. He had always heard Boston was a city of culture, and now there was culture in Miss Chancellor's tables and sofas, in the books that were everywhere, on little <b>shelves</b> like <b>brackets</b> (as if a book were a statuette), in the photographs and watercolours that covered the walls, in the curtains that were festooned rather stiffly in the doorways. He looked at some of the books and saw that his cousin read German; and his impression of the importance of this (as a symptom of superiority) was not diminished {{by the fact that he}} himself had mastered the tongue (knowing it contained a large literature of jurisprudence) during a long, empty, deadly summer on the plantation. It is a curious proof of a certain crude modesty inherent in Basil Ransom that the main effect of his observing his cousin's German books was to give him an idea of the natural energy of Northerners. He had noticed it often before; he had already told himself that he must count with it. It was only after much experience he made the discovery that few Northerners were, in their secret soul, so energetic as he. Many other persons had made it before that. He knew very little about Miss Chancellor; he had come to see her only because she wrote to him; he would never have thought of looking her up, and since then there had been no one in New York he might ask about her. Therefore he could only guess that she was a rich young woman; such a house, inhabited in such a way by a quiet spinster, implied a considerable income. How much? he asked himself; five thousand, ten thousand, fifteen thousand a year? There was richness to our panting young man in the smallest of these figures. He was not of a mercenary spirit, but he had an immense desire for success, and he had more than once reflected that a moderate capital was an aid to achievement. He had seen in his younger years one of the biggest failures that history commemorates, an immense national fiasco, and it had implanted in his mind a deep aversion to the ineffectual. It came over him, while he waited for his hostess to reappear, that she was unmarried as well as rich, that she was sociable (her letter answered for that) as well as single; and he had for a moment a whimsical vision of becoming a partner in so flourishing a firm. He ground his teeth a little as he thought of the contrasts of the human lot; this cushioned feminine nest made him feel unhoused and underfed. Such a mood, however, could only be momentary, for he was conscious at bottom of a bigger stomach than all the culture of Charles Street could fill.|$|R
