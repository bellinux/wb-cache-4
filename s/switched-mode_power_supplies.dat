25|$|A {{ripple current}} is the RMS {{value of a}} {{superimposed}} AC current of any frequency and any waveform of the current curve for continuous operation. It arises, for example, in power supplies (including <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies)</b> after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as biased charge and discharge current through the decoupling or smoothing capacitor.|$|E
25|$|Regulatory {{agencies}} such as the EU have set harmonic limits as a method of improving power factor. Declining component cost has hastened implementation of two different methods. To comply with current EU standard EN61000-3-2, all <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> with output power more than 75W must include passive power factor correction, at least. 80 Plus power supply certification requires a power factor of 0.9 or more.|$|E
25|$|Non-linear loads {{change the}} shape of the current {{waveform}} from a sine wave to some other form. Non-linear loads create harmonic currents in addition to the original (fundamental frequency) AC current. This is of importance in practical power systems that contain non-linear loads such as rectifiers, some forms of electric lighting, electric arc furnaces, welding equipment, <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> variable speed drives and other devices. Filters consisting of linear capacitors and inductors can prevent harmonic currents from entering the supplying system.|$|E

25|$|The {{impedance}} {{specified in}} the data sheets of various capacitors often shows typical curves for different capacitance values. The impedance at the resonant frequency defines the best working point for coupling or decoupling circuits. The higher the capacitance the lower the operable frequency range. Due to their large capacitance values, aluminum electrolytic capacitors have relatively good decoupling properties in the lower frequency range up to about 1MHz or a little more. This and the relatively low price is often the reason for using electrolytic capacitors in 50/60Hz standard or <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies.</b>|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{relatively}} high capacitance values aluminum electrolytic capacitors have low impedance values even at lower frequencies like mains frequency. They are typically used in power supplies, <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> and DC-DC converters for smoothing and buffering rectified DC voltages in many electronic devices {{as well as}} in industrial power supplies and frequency converters as DC link capacitors for drives, inverters for photovoltaic, and converters in wind power plants.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fast and efficient way of simulating multistage power electronic circuits with different stages operating at widely separated frequencies, using the transmission-line modeling (TLM) technique. A multistage circuit can be modeled as several smaller subcircuits, which {{can then be}} simulated individually with different time steps according to their circuit time constants.

2500|$|A {{particularly}} important class of non-linear loads is {{the millions of}} personal computers that typically incorporate <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> (SMPS) with rated output power ranging from a few watts to more than 1kW. Historically, these very-low-cost power supplies incorporated a simple full-wave rectifier that conducted only when the mains instantaneous voltage exceeded the voltage on the input capacitors.
