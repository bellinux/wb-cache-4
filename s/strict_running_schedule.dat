50|$|Operational {{discipline}} was {{improved by}} displaying running and route numbers {{as well as}} destinations on buses and systematising terminal controls through efficient and effective time-keeping, to enhance the regularity {{in the operation of}} the <b>running</b> <b>schedules.</b> Way-side breakdowns were brought down to a bare minimum.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{plan called for}} the class 101 to be based {{in one of the}} main intercity traffic hubs in Germany, namely Frankfurt am Main. The locomotive changes made necessary there by its terminus-type station would allow for the ideal alignment of <b>running</b> <b>schedules</b> and maintenance work of these locomotives.|$|R

50|$|John Levett Jr. married Sarah Hannah Coulson, and {{the couple}} had five {{children}} between 1847 and 1856. Hannah and the children lived at York Street with her Levett in-laws, apparently because her husband was often away training or competing. Money was obviously tight, and Levett's <b>running</b> <b>schedule</b> seems to have left little time for much else.|$|R
5|$|Besides <b>running</b> <b>scheduled</b> {{services}} and government-contracted flights to most {{villages in the}} country, the airline also supports remote research stations, provides charter services for tourists and Greenland's energy and mineral-resource industries and permits medivac during emergencies. Air Greenland has seven subsidiaries, an airline, hotels, tour operators, a travel agency specialized in Greenlandic tourism and the Arctic Umiaq Line, an unprofitable but government-subsidised ferry service.|$|R

The BH&BR did not exercise this power, but several years after it had {{been taken over by}} the B&CDR the latter company started <b>running</b> <b>scheduled</b> passenger steamship services on the route.|$|R
50|$|On March 24, 1947, Reeve Aleutian Airways was incorporated. The {{company was}} <b>running</b> <b>scheduled</b> and charter {{services}} all over Alaska, despite {{not having a}} formal CAA certificate. About this time, Reeve was ordered to get authorization to use the wartime Chain bases he was using. Reeve flew to Washington and leased Dutch Harbor field and acquired landing permits for Kodiak, Adak and Attu. Electra NC14994 was traded in during 1947, going to Continental Airlines.|$|R

Since 2003 the railbuses have been replaced however by Regio-Shuttle RS1s; only one power car (T11) is still working and available for specials.At present the Deutsche Regionaleisenbahn works the Düben-Heide Railway between Wittenberg and Bad Schmiedeberg with a railbus <b>running</b> <b>scheduled</b> services.|$|R
5000|$|Beebe {{relocated}} part of {{the track}} from the highway to private right-of-way and built northward to Oswego on Lake Ontario. The line, 38 mi in length, was completed on July 26, 1911, and its [...] "physical standard" [...] {{was one of the}} highest of any interurban. It was double-tracked, strung with catenary overhead, and built to permit 60 mph <b>running.</b> <b>Schedules</b> demanded more modest speeds, calling for 1:40 total time for the trip.|$|R
40|$|This thesis adopts an {{occupational}} health psychology approach toÃ‚Â· investigate work stress {{in a sample}} of U. K. bus drivers in several depots; Three studies were formulated and conducted. Study 1 (N = 24), based on five focus groups - to examine work stressors drawing upon the experiences of bus drivers. Stressors related to, inter alia, hindrance to the <b>running</b> <b>schedule</b> and arrangement of shifts. The information, supplemented by a literature review, was used to develop ajob-specific stressor instrument. Study 2 (N = 186), centred on a survey of seven depots, used a questionnaire survey consisting of: Karasek's (1985) Job Demands/Control (IDC), Siegrist et aI's (2004) Effort-Reward Imbalance (BRI), social support, psychological and physical ill-health, and the newly developed stressor instrument. Outcome measures included intention to quit, work absence, bus vehicle accident rate, passenger complaints, and smoking/drinking levels. Analyses showed that high demands/low control predicted higher job strain (e. g., ill-health), as did higher effort/lower reward. Workload and fatigue was a major set of sy-essors. The ERI model demonstrated stronger predictive ability of the two stress models. Additionally, buffering effects of control and social support disappeared in high ERI conditions. In the third study (N = 246) of seven depots, a final questionnaire survey was administered, again using the ERI measure, combined with job satisfaction, driver coping behaviours, and bus driver orientation (in terms of safety or <b>running</b> <b>schedule).</b> Results indicated that ERI was related to reduced job satisfaction, more maladaptive driver coping behaviour, and greater driver orientation towards the <b>running</b> <b>schedule.</b> Job satisfaction was found to be important in the ERI - intention to quit relationship, and overcommitment - work absence/intention to quit relationship. Considered together, these studies provide strong evidence for the need for occupational stress to be managed. Stress research contributions, methodological limitations, and recommendations for industry are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

50|$|Metro Trains updated the <b>running</b> <b>schedules</b> in May 2011 to {{alleviate}} late running (and thus penalties). In reality, {{in many cases}} services were simply given {{a few more minutes}} per trip to offset any late running. In some instances, some trains are required to wait at stations mid-journey to return to schedule. Many passengers criticised this move, with some saying that effort should be placed on upgrading infrastructure to allow more efficient operation rather than padding timetables to suit the operator.|$|R
50|$|Page has {{a passion}} for running and runs on a regular basis. In 1979, {{he became the first}} active NFL player to {{complete}} a marathon. His running routine, which he took up while helping his wife quit smoking, is believed to have contributed to his dismissal from the Minnesota Vikings. His <b>running</b> <b>schedule</b> of 35-40 miles per week during the season, and 55 miles per week in the offseason, caused his weight to drop below that dictated by the Vikings.|$|R

5000|$|In 1970, {{inspired}} by Ayn Rand's novel, The Fountainhead, he started an architecture practice {{under the name}} [...] "Jaisim-Fountainhead". The practice grew from 1970 to 1975, winning a National Competition for the Cochin Stadia, Presidents Nomination for the Small Industries Pavilion and the ‘TAJ Fisherman’s Cove’. From 1975 to 1980, the firm began working overseas, and ventured into other areas of building, such as the import and distribution of building materials, <b>running</b> <b>scheduled</b> contracts, and <b>running</b> a stone crusher and fabrication unit. In 1980 he returned to India and settled in Bangalore.|$|R

5000|$|In {{television}} serials, however, {{running time}} becomes {{an even greater}} concern, due to the strict timeslot limitations, especially on channels which are ad-supported, where there can only be approximately 20 minutes of actual show per half-hour timeslot (depending on the station and the particular format of the show, this may/may not include opening credits; closing credits may/may not count towards running time, either, in some cases, because many ad-supported stations now [...] "squish" [...] the closing credits or force them into a split-screen {{in order to show}} more advertising), and the majority of shows are in either a half-hour or one-hour timeslot. This somewhat forces producers of television serials to both break up the acts in a manner that will (hopefully) make the viewer want to continue watching after the ad-break, and to not go over the <b>stricter</b> <b>running</b> time limits.|$|R
