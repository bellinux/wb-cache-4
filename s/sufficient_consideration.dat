The Allies provided for the DPs according to nationality, and initially did not recognize Jews as constituting a separate group.

2500|$|The {{resolution}} of these restrictions came shortly after 1585, {{when a new}} Court of Exchequer Chamber was established to hear common law appeals. In 1602, in Slade v Morley, a grain merchant named Slade claimed that Morley had agreed to buy wheat and rye for £16, but then had backed out. Actions for debt were in {{the jurisdiction of the}} Court of Common Pleas, which had required both (1) proof of a debt, and (2) a subsequent promise to repay the debt, so that a finding of deceit (for non-payment) could be made against a defendant. But if a claimant wanted to simply demand payment of the contractual debt (rather than a subsequent promise to pay) he could have to risk a wager of law. The judges of the Court of the King's Bench was prepared to allow [...] "assumpsit" [...] actions (for obligations being assumed) simply from proof of the original agreement. With a majority in the Exchquer Chamber, after six years Lord Popham CJ held that [...] "every contract importeth in itself an Assumpsit". Around the same time the Common Pleas indicated a different limit for contract enforcement in Bret v JS, that [...] "natural affection of itself is not a <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration</b> to ground an assumpsit" [...] and {{there had to be some}} [...] "express quid pro quo". Now that wager of law, and sealed covenants were essentially unnecessary, the Statute of Frauds 1677 codified the contract types that were thought should still require some form. Over the late 17th and 18th centuries Sir John Holt, and then Lord Mansfield actively incorporated the principles of international trade law and custom into English common law as they saw it: principles of commercial certainty, good faith, fair dealing, and the enforceability of seriously intended promises. As Lord Mansfield held, [...] "Mercantile law is not the law of a particular country but the law of all nations", and [...] "the law of merchants and the law of the land is the same".|$|E

For safety and reliability reasons, the low voltage (LV) high resistance grounding (HRG) system is also increasingly used in the pulp and paper, petroleum and chemical, and semiconductor industries. Fault detection is easiest and fastest with a solidly grounded system. However, a solidly grounded system has many limitations such as severe fault damage, poor reliability on essential circuits, and electrical noise caused by the high magnitude of ground fault currents. This paper will briefly address {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of LV grounding systems. An example of a low voltage HRG system in the LV system of a nuclear power plant will be presented.

30|$|To {{address the}} {{problems}} of primary science education and to adapt Western educational theories to a CHC, curriculum designs are needed that take characteristics of cultures into consideration (Nguyen et al. 2005; Örtenblad, Babur and Kumari 2012). A culturally appropriate pedagogy for visual communication students has been developed with the application of social constructivist theories for a CHC (Yam, Tan, and Lim 2016). Though such a pedagogy design was proved to enable CHC students to engage socially during the learning process with <b>sufficient</b> <b>considerations</b> of their cultural influences, {{there is a lack}} of information on how CHC teachers interact with the culturally appropriate design. The lack of knowledge on CHC teachers’ interaction with a culturally appropriate curriculum has hindered researchers and educators from adequately evaluating such a curriculum design and from thoroughly assessing the curriculum implementation. It can hardly be expected that CHC teachers, who are unfamiliar with a social constructivist approach, could go smoothly with a new curriculum based on social constructivism and achieve intended educational goals unless they have opportunities to learn how to teach the curriculum. Any change or transformation in classroom practices ultimately rely on teachers (Borko 2004; Vos et al. 2010) and the interaction between teachers and the curriculum is needed to provide practical information which is useful for adjusting, improving, and disseminating the culturally appropriate curriculum for a wide use.|$|R

Jingzhou, {{which is one of}} the first 24 “Historic Cultural Cities” in China, designated three historic districts in 2014. However, there are many issues with the existing preservation plans. Before the completed implementation of the plans, this thesis hopes to provide better solutions for creating more equitable and resilient historic districts through criticizing the existing plans, researching on case studies, as well as re-programming and redesigning the historic districts. The criticisms mainly focus on lacking <b>sufficient</b> <b>considerations</b> of large-scale demolition on local community, planning for superfluous amount of land use for tourism that brings negative impact on local residents’ life, and the improper designs of new buildings that mismatch the scales and form of existing buildings and erase the traces of history.

I told him at once that I had been seriously thinking over the matter for some time, and that I had for several reasons {{come to the conclusion that}} it would be better that our engagement should terminate, and then gave him my first reason. He was very earnest, and protested that as he had never for a moment believed in these rumours he could not see that there was any reason whatever for breaking off the engagement. I said that I did him full justice in that respect, but that the matter had certainly been a great source of annoyance to him, and that I was convinced of the probability of further trouble of the same kind, and that as we had been powerless to detect the author of this we might be as powerless in the future. Then I frankly told him that I knew that his hopes were greatly centred in his political career, and that for him to have a wife who was the subject of a scandal would be a very serious drawback to him. He did not attempt to deny this, but then urged that a breach of the engagement at present would be taken to mean that he had been affected by the rumours.

60|$|Again: if {{rights of}} {{property}} {{over the same}} things are of different extent in different countries, so also are they exercised over different things. In all countries at a former time, and in some countries still, the right of property extended and extends to the ownership of human beings. There has often been property in public trusts, as in judicial offices, and a vast multitude of others in France before the Revolution; {{there are still a}} few patent offices in Great Britain, though I believe they will cease by operation of law on the death of the present holders; and we are only now abolishing property in army rank. Public bodies, constituted and endowed for public purposes, still claim the same inviolable right of property in their estates which individuals have in theirs, and though a sound political morality does not acknowledge this claim, the law supports it. We thus see that the right of property is differently interpreted, and held to be of different extent, in different times and places; that the conception entertained of it is a varying conception, has been frequently revised, and may admit of still further revision. It is also to be noticed that the revisions which it has hitherto undergone in the progress of society have generally been improvements. When, therefore, it is maintained, rightly or wrongly, that some change or modification in the powers exercised over things by the persons legally recognised as their proprietors would be beneficial to the public and conducive to the general improvement, it is no good answer to this merely to say that the proposed change conflicts with the idea of property. The idea of property is not some one thing, identical throughout history and incapable of alteration, but is variable like all other creations of the human mind; at any given time it is a brief expression denoting the rights over things conferred by the law or custom of some given society at that time; but neither on this point nor on any other has the law and custom of a given time and place a claim to be stereotyped for ever. A proposed reform in laws or customs is not necessarily objectionable because its adoption would imply, not the adaptation of all human affairs to the existing idea of property, but the adaptation of existing ideas of property to the growth and improvement of human affairs. This is said without prejudice to the equitable claim of proprietors to be compensated by the state for such legal rights of a proprietary nature as they may be dispossessed of for the public advantage. That equitable claim, the grounds and the just limits of it, are a subject by itself, and as such will be discussed hereafter. Under this condition, however, society is fully entitled to abrogate or alter any particular right of property which on <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration</b> it judges to {{stand in the way of}} the public good. And assuredly the terrible case which, as we saw in a former chapter, Socialists are able to make out against the present economic order of society, demands a full consideration of all means by which the institution may have a chance of being made to work in a manner more beneficial to that large portion of society which at present enjoys the least share of its direct benefits.|$|E

The first argument conflates moral reasons and defeasible duties; the second misunderstands the scope of a defeasible duty to benefit. This argument has important practical and theoretical implications: practically, it provides a response to a highly damaging discourse on maternal behaviour; theoretically, it provides the framework for a clearer understanding of the scope and nature of defeasible duties to benefit...|$|R

Evidence has been demonstrated using both existing literature and semi-structured interviews with one of the BIM software vendors. The gathered results demonstrate the need for formal usability considerations, which require multi-disciplinary construction stakeholders. The practical implications suggest that incorporating multidisciplinary stakeholders can support further developments of BIM technology.
