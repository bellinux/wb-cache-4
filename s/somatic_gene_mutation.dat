Exome sequencing of these lines indicates a significantly lower mutation load in SCNT ESCs than iPSCs of syngeneic background. In addition, one SCNT-ESC line has no detectable exome mutation, and two pairs of SCNT-ESC lines only have shared preexisting mutations. In contrast, every iPSC line carries unique mutations.

To investigate the role of <b>somatic</b> VHL <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> in non-famitial RCC, we analysed 99 primary RCC for VHL <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> by SSCP and heteroduplex analysis. <b>Somatic</b> VHL <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> were identified in 30 of 65 (46 %) sporadic RCC with chromosome 3 p allele loss and one of 34 (3 %) tumours with no LOH for chromosome 3 p.

Most RCCs with somatic VHL mutations (23 of 27 (85 %) informative cases) had chromosome 3 p 25 allele loss in the region of the VHL gene so that both alleles of the VHL gene had been inactivated as expected from a two-hit model of tumorigenesis.

The exception to this is when FH is associated with deficiency in more than one limb; for example, bilateral FH is often an autosomal dominant condition. When multiple limbs are affected by a limb deficiency, one can often assume that this was either an autosomal-dominant gene disorder (inherited or new mutation) or related to a teratologic agent (drug, radiation, virus, etc.). FH has been reproduced in a mouse model [4], suggesting that in most cases it may be a <b>somatic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutation,</b> although this theory has not been confirmed.|$|E
30|$|As a {{critical}} tumor suppressor, p 53 is inactivated in human cancer cells by <b>somatic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutation</b> or disruption of pathways required for its activation. Therefore, {{it is critical}} to elucidate the mechanism underlying p 53 activation after genotoxic and cellular stresses. Accumulating evidence has indicated the importance of posttranslational modifications such as acetylation in regulating p 53 stability and activity. However, the physiological roles of the eight identified acetylation events in regulating p 53 responses remain to be fully understood. By employing homologous recombination, we introduced various combinations of missense mutations (lysine to arginine) into eight acetylation sites of the endogenous p 53 gene in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). By determining the p 53 responses to DNA damage in the p 53 knock-in mutant hESCs and their derivatives, we demonstrate physiological importance of the acetylation events within the core domain (K 120 and K 164) and at the C-terminus (K 370 / 372 / 373 / 381 / 382 / 386) in regulating human p 53 responses to DNA damage.|$|E

TALENs consist of an N-terminal domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal domain, which are derived from a transcription activator-like effector, and the non-specific nuclease domain of FokI. Using Xenopus tropicalis (X. tropicalis), we compared the toxicities and somatic mutation activities of four TALEN architectures in a side-by-side manner: a basic TALEN, a scaffold with the same truncated N- and C-terminal domains as GoldyTALEN, a scaffold with the truncated N- and C-terminal domains and an obligate heterodimeric nuclease domain, and a scaffold with the truncated N- and C-terminal domains and an obligate heterodimeric Sharkey nuclease domain. The strongest phenotype and targeted <b>somatic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutation</b> were induced by the injection of TALEN mRNAs containing the truncated N-and C-terminal domains and an obligate heterodimeric nuclease domain.

An increase in the angiopoietin expression results in uncontrolled maturation and remodelling of vessels, resulting in dystrophic vascular architecture typical of FNH [1, 7]. Wanless et al. postulated that portal tract injury due to either portal tract inflammation or arterial ischaemia is the primary event leading to vascular shunting with hepatocyte hyperplasia and cholestasis [8, 9]. Arterial hyperperfusion and the resultant hyperoxemia lead to increased expression of vascular endothelial and somatic growth factors and activation of hepatic stellate cells leading to the formation of the characteristic central scar [8].|$|R
30|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} (FD) is a slowly progressing bone lesion {{resulting from}} the displacement of normal medullary bone with abnormal fibro-osseous connective tissue. FD can be classified as monostotic when it involves a single bone and polyostotic when it involves multiple bones [1]. The former has an incidence of 70 – 80 %, while the latter {{may be seen in}} 20 – 30 % of patients with FD [13 – 15]. The monostotic form is usually asymptomatic, whereas the polyostotic form, accompanied by various endocrine disorders, irregular skin pigmentation, and early sexual maturity, is called McCune–Albright syndrome [1, 3, 16]. The monostotic type is more prevalent in the maxilla in the craniomaxillofacial skeleton [1, 3, 17]. In a patient whose only clinical feature is monostotic fibrous dysplasia, biopsy and identification of a <b>somatic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutation</b> may be required to confirm the diagnosis [1]. However, many experienced clinicians and radiologists will often notice that a lesion appears characteristic of FD on radiographic examination because it is an expansile and intramedullary lesion with a ground-glass appearance, thus diagnosing FD without the need for biopsy in typical cases [3]. Diagnosis can also be made by histologic examination of the biopsied tissue. The typical microscopic features of FD include a background of loosely arranged fibrous stroma with irregularly shaped bony trabeculae. The bone trabeculae are thin and disconnected to each other and have been described as “Chinese characters” [1, 3, 12, 18].|$|E

Particularly, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have the advantage to provide a source of autologous transplantable blood cell populations suitable for treatment of patient specific hematological diseases. This research aims to derive human lymphocytes from hiPSCs. There are three projects: The overall generation of human lymphocytes (B cell, T cell and NK cell) from hiPSCs is explored in Project I. In Project II and III, based on the derivation of NK cells, two human immunodeficiency disease models, both caused by specific <b>somatic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutation,</b> are established using human pluripotent stem cells. The ultimate goal of this research is to use hiPSCs to study the normal development of human lymphocytes in vitro, as well as model human immunodeficiency diseases by combining with gene therapy methods, thus providing a novel approach for immunotherapy. The hypothesis is that human lymphocytes can be derived from hiPSCs and this will enable the establishment of in vitro models to study human immunodeficiency diseases. Specific aims: 1.

Therefore, it {{is critical}} to elucidate the pathways that activate p 53. Accumulating evidence indicates that posttranslational modifications of p 53, including phosphorylation and acetylation, are involved in regulating p 53 stability and activity. While phosphorylation of p 53 at N-terminus is important to activate some of p 53 -dependent functions, none of the phosphorylation events are critical for p 53 activation (Chao et al., 2003; Chao et al., 2006). Recent studies indicate that human p 53 can be acetylated at multiple lysine residues by Tip 60 and CBP, including K 120, K 164, K 320, and the C-terminal K 370 / 372 / 373 / 381 / 382 / 386 (Brooks and Gu, 2011). Using human cancer cell lines expressing p 53 with various lysine to arginine mutations, these studies indicate that K 120 R, K 164 R as well as K 120 / 164 R double mutations partially impaired the p 53 -dependent functions (Sykes et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2008). In addition, mutation of the eight acetylation sites to arginine abolishes the p 53 -dependent functions, suggesting that these acetylation events play synergistic and critical roles in activating p 53 (Sykes et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2006, 2008).|$|E

We report that {{a hallmark of}} MDSs is activation of the NLRP 3 inflammasome, which drives clonal expansion and pyroptotic cell death. Independent of genotype, MDS hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) overexpress inflammasome proteins and manifest activated NLRP 3 complexes that direct activation of caspase- 1, generation of interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and IL- 18, and pyroptotic cell death.

The United States began testing hydrogen bombs in 1952, sending radioactive fallout around the globe. Earlier more localized fallout was generated starting in 1945 from tests of atomic weapons at Nevada test sites. The Atomic Energy Commission claimed the tests would not harm human health. Geneticists knew from animal and plant experiments that radiation can cause both illness and gene mutations. They spoke out to warn the policymakers and the public.

However, large inter-laboratory variations in the HPRT mutant frequency (MF) call for further investigation of inter-laboratory differences in the experimental methodology, and development of an optimal but easy uniform cloning protocol. As part of the EU Concerted Action on HPRT Mutation (EUCAHM), we have carried out two Ring tests for the T-cell cloning assay. For each test, duplicate and coded samples from three buffy coats were distributed to five laboratories for determination of MF using six different protocols. The results indicated a good agreement between split samples within each laboratory. However, both the cloning efficiencies (CEs) and MFs measured for the same blood donors showed substantial inter-laboratory variations. Also, different medium compositions used in {{one and the same}} laboratory resulted in a remarkable difference in the level of MF. A uniform operating protocol (UOP) was proposed and compared with the traditional protocols in the second Ring test. The UOP (preincubation) increased the CE in laboratories traditionally using preincubation, but decreased the CE in laboratories traditionally using priming. Adjusted for donor, use of different protocols contributed significantly to the overall variation in lnCE (P = 0. 0004) and lnMF (P = 0. 03), but there was no significant laboratory effect on the lnCE (P = 0. 38) or lnMF (P = 0. 14) produced by the UOP alone. Finally, a simplified version of the UOP using the serum-free medium X-Vivo 10 and PMA was tested in one laboratory, and found to produce a considerable increase in CE.

No screening methods aimed at high risk individuals are currently supported by the National Cancer Institute or other medical organizations. Since the risk for lung cancer persists even after smoking cessation, studies of methods to detect lung cancer in its early stages, when it is amenable to cure, are clearly needed. This study examined a novel method of sputum collection and processing to determine whether the adequacy of the samples collected was improved over conventional preparation methods. We also examined lung function as a possible predictor of cytologic abnormality in the sputum of individuals at high risk for lung cancer, and studied the potential of a molecular biomarker for the early detection of lung cancer. This study employed a cross-sectional design and utilized quantitative methods for exploring the relationships between the variables, particularly those of lung function, cytologic diagnosis and gene mutation status, with personal risk factors for developing lung cancer. This study demonstrated an association between lung function and cytologic diagnosis of moderate or worse atypia in the sputum collected from these participants and examined at the University of Colorado. We also demonstrated a higher rate of sputum specimen adequacy than has been previously reported from conventional clinical experience. We examined the feasibility of conducting <b>somatic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutation</b> analysis on the samples collected by this novel method.

Here, we generated a knockin mouse line termed LSL-R 26 Tva-lacZ with concomitant conditional expression of TVA and lacZ by targeting the Rosa 26 locus. A loxP-flanked transcriptional stop cassette was used for conditional activation of TVA and LacZ expression in a Cre-recombinase-dependent manner. To demonstrate the ability of this system for conditional <b>somatic</b> <b>gene</b> transfer in vivo, we directed TVA expression to the pancreas. Introduction of an RCAS vector with Bryan-RSV polymerase and subgroup A envelope [RCASBP(A) ] carrying oncogenic KrasG 12 D induced focal ductal pancreatic lesions that recapitulate human pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias that progress to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. TVA-mediated infection of genetically engineered mice with endogenous expression of KrasG 12 D in pancreatic progenitor cells by using RCASBP(A) virus carrying a short hairpin RNA directed against murine TP 53, resulted in dramatically enhanced progression to invasive adenocarcinomas.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A century ago, Boveri {{proposed}} that {{cancer is caused}} by aneuploidy, an abnormal balance of chromosomes, because aneuploidy correlates with cancer and because experimental aneuploidy generates “pathological ” phenotypes. Half a century later, when cancers {{were found to be}} nonclonal for aneuploidy, but clonal for <b>somatic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutations,</b> this hypothesis was abandoned. As a result, aneuploidy is now generally viewed as a consequence, and mutated genes as a cause of cancer. However, we have recently proposed a two-stage mechanism of carcinogenesis that resolves the discrepancy between clonal mutation and nonclonal karyotypes. The proposal is as follows: in stage 1, a carcinogen “initiates ” carcinogenesis by generating a preneoplastic aneuploidy; in stage 2, aneuploidy causes asymmetric mitosis because it biases balance-sensitive spindle and chromosomal proteins and alters centrosomes both numerically and structurally (in proportion to the degree of aneuploidy). Therefore, the karyotype of an initiated cell evolves autocatalytically, generating ever-new chromosome combinations, including neoplastic ones. Accordingly, the heterogeneous karyotypes of “clonal ” cancers are an inevitable consequence of the karyotypic instability of aneuploid cells. The notorious long latent periods, of months to decades, from carcinogen to carcinogenesis, would reflect the low probability of evolving by chance karyotypes that compete favorably with normal cells, in principle analagou...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to relate the age at onset of Huntington's disease to parental factors, the effects of parental onset-age (Po) {{and the age of}} the {{transmitting}} parent at the birth of a subsequently affected child (Pc) have been examined in a sample of cases ascertained from Victorian kindreds. There was a significant positive linear regression of onset-age on the variable Po-Pc; the result was independent of the sex of affected parent or child. It is suggested that the pathogenetic process is activated in individuals at a fixed time before their genetically determined onset-ages and need not commence at birth. <b>Somatic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> accumulating with age may interact with modifiers activated at initiation of pathogenesis and favour the transmission of genes determining early onset. An important conclusion for genetic counselling is the desirability of parents at risk who intend to have children to plan their families early in life so that the illness will tend to appear in late adulthood in their affected children. The regression equation may also be applied to estimate the risk of inheritance of the disorder and, by taking interfamilial variation into account, appears to have an advantage over the esisting method based on the distribution of onsettages...|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional {{polyacrylamide}} gel electrophoresis {{has been used to}} detect <b>somatic</b> cell <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> altering protein structure, following ethylnitrosourea treatment of cultured human lymphoblastoid cells. A total of 267 polypeptides encoded by 263 loci were scored in a series of 1143 lymphoblastoid clones. Sixty-five electrophoretic mutants were detected at a total of 49 loci. Sixteen of the 65 mutations were phenotypically repeat mutations, occurring at 11 loci. Furthermore, structural mutations occurred more frequently at loci known to be polymorphic. These results provide evidence that the mutations that are detectable at the protein level by two-dimensional {{polyacrylamide gel}} electrophoresis do not occur at random and that their frequency is greater among polymorphic loci...|$|R
40|$|We {{determined}} frequency/types of K-ras {{mutations in}} colorectal/lung cancer. ADx-K-ras kit (real-time/double-loop probe PCR) {{was used to}} detect <b>somatic</b> tumor <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> compared with Sanger DNA sequencing using 583 colorectal and 244 lung cancer paraffin-embedded clinical samples. Genomic DNA was used in both methods; mutation rates at codons 12 / 13 and frequency of each mutation were detected and compared. The data show that 91. 4 % colorectal and 59. 0 % lung carcinoma samples were detected conclusively by DNA sequencing, whereas 100 % colorectal and lung samples were detected by ADx-K-ras kit. K-ras <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> were detected in 32. 9 - 27. 4 % colorectal samples using kit and sequencing methods, respectively. Whereas 10. 6 - 8. 3 % lung cancer samples were positively detected by kit and sequencing methods, respectively. Notably, 172 / 677 showed mutations and 467 / 677 showed wild type by both methods; 38 samples showed mutations with kit but wild type with sequencing. Mutations in colorectal samples were as follows: GGT -> GAT/codon- 12 (35. 1 %); GGC -> GAC/codon- 13 (26. 6 %); GGT -> GTT/codon- 12 (18. 2 %); and GGT -> GCT/codon- 12 (1. 6 %). Mutations in lung samples were as follows: GGT > GTT/codon- 12 (40. 9 %) and GGT>GCT/codon- 12 (4. 5 %). In conclusion, K-ras mutations involved 32. 2 % colorectal and 10. 6 % lung samples among this cohort. ADx-K-ras real-time PCR showed higher detection rates (P < 0. 05). The kit method has good clinical applicability as it is simple, fast, less prone to contamination and hence can be used effectively and reliably for clinical screening of <b>somatic</b> tumor <b>gene</b> <b>mutations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Because {{there is}} {{widespread}} agreement {{about the importance of}} tissue microenvironment and cell differentiation signals in tumor biology (combined> 100 000 citations in PubMed), the commen-tary by Dr. Baker (1) could be regarded as a “straw man ” kerfuffle, except that it also argues against a role for acquired cancer <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> as a critical event in tumorigenesis. Dr. Baker quotes Peyton Rous, who was unable in 1959 (2) to reconcile the ability of animal viruses to rapidly induce tumor formation within the emerging <b>somatic</b> cancer <b>gene</b> <b>mutation</b> framework.

40|$|Currently, {{gastric cancer}} (GC) {{is one of}} the most {{frequently}} diagnosed neoplasms, with a global burden of 723000 deaths in 2012. It is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. There are numerous possible factors that stimulate the pro-carcinogenic activity of important genes. These factors include genetic susceptibility expressed in a single-nucleotide polymorphism, various acquired mutations (chromosomal instability, microsatellite instability, <b>somatic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutations,</b> epigenetic alterations) and environmental circumstances (e. g., Helicobcter pylori infection, EBV infection, diet, and smoking). Most of the aforementioned pathways overlap, and authors agree that a clear-cut pathway for GC may not exist. Thus, the categorization of carcinogenic events is complicated. Lately, it has been claimed that research on early-onset gastric carcinoma (EOGC) and hereditary GC may contribute towards unravelling some part of the mystery of the GC molecular pattern because young patients are less exposed to environmental carcinogens and because carcinogenesis in this setting may be more dependent on genetic factors. The comparison of various aspects that differ and coexist in EOGCs and conventional GCs might enable scientists to: distinguish which features in the pathway of gastric carcinogenesis are modifiable, discover specific GC markers and identify a specific target. This review provides a summary of the data published thus far concerning the molecular characteristics of GC and highlights the outstanding features of EOGC...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} and molecular findings of 77 cases of neonatal leukemia (NL) and 380 of infant leukemia (IL) {{were selected to}} distinguish features between NL and IL. <b>Somatic</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> associated with acute leukemia including FLT 3, RAS and PTPN 11 were revisited. There were 42 cases of congenital leukemia associated with Down syndrome (DS) and 39 of these cases presented features of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) -M 7. Twenty-seven of the DS cases underwent spontaneous remission and were reclassified as a transient myeloproliferative disorder. GATA 1 mutations were found in 70 % of these cases. in non-DS, frequent abnormalities were MLL rearrangements, mainly MLL-AFF 1 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and MLL-MLLT 3 in AML. the FLT 3 mutation was not found, while RAS (n = 4) and PTPN 11 (n = 2) mutations were identified and reported {{for the first time}} in NL. There was substantial evidence to support that somatic abnormalities occur in utero. Thus, congenital leukemia is a good model for understanding leukemogenesis.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of detecting human <b>somatic</b> structural <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> by two dimensional electrophoresis has been investigated. A lymphoblastoid cell line was grown as a mass {{culture in the}} presence of ethylnitrosourea, after which cells were regrown as single cell clones. A total of 257 polypeptide spots were analyzed in gels derived from 186 clones. Four structural mutations were detected by visual analysis of the gels. Computer analysis of gels corresponding to the mutant clones was also undertaken. At a spot size threshold of 200 spots to be matched using a computer algorithm, all four mutant polypeptides were detected. These results indicate the usefulness of the two-dimensional approach for mutagenesis studies at the protein level...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{hyperparathyroidism}} is {{a common}} disorder that involves the pathological enlargement {{of one or more}} parathyroid glands resulting in excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The exact pathogenesis of this disease remains to be fully understood. In recent years interest has focussed on the interaction between menin protein and the transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta/Smad signalling pathway. In vitro experimentation has demonstrated that the presence of menin is required for TGF-beta to effectively inhibit parathyroid cell proliferation and PTH production. This observation correlates with the almost universal occurrence of parathyroid tumors accompanying the inactivation of menin in multiple endocrine neoplasia Type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome and the high rate of <b>somatic</b> menin <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> seen in sporadic parathyroid adenomas. This chapter aims to review the role of menin in primary hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid hormone-regulation, including the influences of MEN 1 <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> on parathyroid cell proliferation, differentiation and tumorigenesis...|$|R
