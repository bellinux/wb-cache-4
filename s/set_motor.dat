Miami defeated Louisville 49-28, making the MAC 2-0 in bowl games that year. Unusually for the Motor City Bowl there were two MVPs: Bowling Green quarterback Josh Harris and Northwestern running back Jason Wright. Harris passed for 386 yards, including three touchdown passes, and rushed for Bowling Green's fourth touchdown. Harris' completion record of 38/50 and total offense of 454 yards <b>set</b> <b>Motor</b> City Bowl records.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s {{and in the}} early years after 2000, unknown works by Saya Myit were {{discovered}} in Burma which called for a reappraisal of his oeuvre and his contributions to Burmese painting. In about 1996, a Burmese art dealer, Tin Win of Beikthano Gallery, happened upon four works by Saya Myit that were in the possession of one of Saya Myit's publishers of Buddhist illustrations for books. The four works belonged to a set of paintings which have been entitled An Auspicious Charity. The two most provocative paintings in the four-piece <b>set,</b> <b>Motor</b> Car Procession and Carriage Procession (both 51 x 78.5 cm), have been reproduced in books. The former painting appears in Old Myanmar Paintings in the Collection of U Win (2006) by Hla Tin Htun [...] and both paintings appear in Burmese Painting: A Linear and Lateral History (2009) by Andrew Ranard. On the basis of the features of the motor car depicted in Motor Car Procession, the works can be dated to the early 1930s. The two paintings with vehicles are dramatically different from anything that had been produced in Burmese painting up until that time, or even now, in style and technique. In both paintings, the vehicles (carriage and motor car) sit {{in the center of the}} pieces, surrounded by a large crowd of followers who are depicted in minuscule, realistic detail. The atmospheric effects and linear perspective in the piece are polished and so are the anatomical proportions of all the subjects. In this sense, the paintings are of the Western style, but both possess Traditional features in the statuesque, arrested quality of the scenes. The crowd scenes depict privileged and powerful persons as well as the subservient or anonymous with equal determination of detail, and have been described as possessing a [...] "democratic gestalt".|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of {{two groups of}} molecular motors pulling in opposite directions on a rigid filament is studied theoretically. To this end we first consider the behavior of one <b>set</b> of <b>motors</b> pulling in a single direction against an external force using a new mean-field approach. Based on these results we analyze a similar setup with two <b>sets</b> of <b>motors</b> pulling in opposite directions in a tug-of-war {{in the presence of}} an external force. In both cases we find that the interplay of fluid friction and protein friction leads to a complex phase diagram where the force-velocity relations can exhibit regions of bistability and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Finally, motivated by recent work, we turn to the case of motility assay experiments where motors bound to a surface push on a bundle of filaments. We find that, depending on the absence or the presence of a bistability in the force-velocity curve at zero force, the bundle exhibits anomalous or biased diffusion on long-time and large-length scales...|$|R
