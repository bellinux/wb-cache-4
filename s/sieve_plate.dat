The increased temperature dependence below 10 C was not observed for cytoplasmic streaming or oxygen uptake in bean. Bean petioles were served to release pressure in order to determine whether sieve tubes are obstructed in cold-treated petioles. The resulting pressure release caused serious displacement of the crystalline protein bodies in the sieve tubes of petioles at 25 C, but in those locally cooled to 0 C for 30 minutes little displacement occurred, indicating obstruction in the latter. An ultrastructural study of sieve tubes in tissue frozen rapidly in situ and dehydrated by freeze substitution revealed that treatment at 0 C for 30 minutes caused structural alteration and displacement of the cytoplasmic material lining the sieve tube wall resulting in occlusion of <b>sieve</b> <b>plates.</b> The <b>sieve</b> <b>plates</b> of the control petioles at 25 C were generally clear of obstructions.

50|$|Phloem is {{an equally}} {{important}} plant tissue as {{it also is}} part of the 'plumbing system' of a plant. Primarily, phloem carries dissolved food substances throughout the plant. This conduction system is composed of sieve-tube member and companion cells, that are without secondary walls. The parent cells of the vascular cambium produce both xylem and phloem. This usually also includes fibers, parenchyma and ray cells. Sieve tubes are formed from sieve-tube members laid end to end. The end walls, unlike vessel members in xylem, do not have openings. The end walls, however, are full of small pores where cytoplasm extends from cell to cell. These porous connections are called sieve plates. In {{spite of the fact that}} their cytoplasm is actively involved in the conduction of food materials, sieve-tube members do not have nuclei at maturity. It is the companion cells that are nestled between sieve-tube members that function in some manner bringing about the conduction of food. Sieve-tube members that are alive contain a polymer called callose, a carbohydrate polymer, forming the callus pad/callus, the colourless substance that covers the <b>sieve</b> <b>plate.</b> Callose stays in solution as long as the cell contents are under pressure.

40|$|The ontogenetic {{development}} of the secondary sieve elements in ash, Fraxinus excelsior is traced by using mainly conventional electron microscopy. In addition, negative staining of the exudate and light microscopy have also been used. No major differences from the established trends have been observed in the differentiation of these sieve elements. There {{is evidence that the}} P-protein in the sieve elements originates from helical polysomes found scattered in the dense cytoplasm of young sieve elements. These polysomes also give the appearance of having been derived from rough ER cisternae. Reorganisation of the fibrillar P-protein into the tubular form also seems to take place in the larger P-protein bodies. In negatively-stained preparations, a suggestion of a tightening of the double helix of the P-protein fibrils is discernible. This reorganisation is however not consistent. The usual banding of the fibrillar P-protein is prominent. Most of the mature <b>sieve</b> <b>plates</b> show occluded pores either callosed or not. The P-protein frequently appears to fray out on the downstream side and sometimes on the upstream side as well. This has a bearing on the nature of functioning <b>sieve</b> <b>plates</b> and {{does not seem to be}} due to artifacts. Empty spaces which represent probably a peculiar artifact are observed immediately above most of the mature <b>sieve</b> <b>plates.</b> P-protein seems to pile above these "barrier" spaces while the <b>sieve</b> <b>plates</b> remain occluded with P-protein. Other formations of peculiar interest are the plasmalemmal invaginations ("blebs") found both in the sieve elements and in the parenchyma cells.

40|$|Sieve {{elements}} {{are one of}} the least understood cell types in plants. Translocation velocities and volume flow to supply sinks with photoassimilates greatly depend on the geometry of the microfluidic sieve tube system and especially on the anatomy of sieve plates and <b>sieve</b> <b>plate</b> pores. Several models for phloem translocation have been developed, but appropriate data on the geometry of pores, plates, sieve elements, and flow parameters are lacking.

Sieve tube–specific conductivity and its reduction by callose deposition after injury was calculated for green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), bamboo (Phyllostachys nuda), squash (Cucurbita maxima), castor bean (Ricinus communis), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Phloem sap velocity measurements by magnetic resonance imaging velocimetry indicate that higher conductivity is not accompanied by a higher velocity.

40|$|During {{maturation}} of sieve {{elements in}} Cucurbita maxima Duchesne, the P-protein bodies (slime bodies) usually disperse in the tonoplast-free cell. In some sieve elements the P-protein bodies fail to disperse. The occurrence of dispersal or nondispersal of P-protein bodies {{can be related}} to the position of the sieve elements in the stem or petiole. In the sieve elements within the vascular bundle the bodies normally disperse; in the extrafascicular sieve elements the bodies often fail to disperse. Extrafascicular sieve elements showing partial dispersal also occur. The appearance of the <b>sieve</b> <b>plate</b> in fixed material is related to the degree of dispersal or nondispersal of the P-protein bodies.

The effects of cytochalasin D on fenestrations were abrogated by co-administration of Triton X- 100, suggesting that actin disruption increases fenestrations by its effects on membrane rafts. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) depleted lipid-ordered membrane and increased fenestrations. The results are consistent with a sieve-raft interaction, where fenestrations form in non-raft lipid-disordered regions of endothelial cells once the membrane-stabilizing effects of actin cytoskeleton and membrane rafts are diminished.
