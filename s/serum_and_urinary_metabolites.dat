The turnover of extracellular matrix was monitored for 1 year by following up <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>metabolites.</b> RESULTS: The serum levels of type III collagen and its N-terminal propeptide were correlated with the lesion size (P < 0. 035) after 4 and 12 months of treatment respectively. After 4 months of treatment, urinary pyridinoline was higher (P = 0. 04) in patients whose lesion size was reduced by more than 50 % and serum hyaluronan was lower in patients who had lesions active for less than 5 years (P < 0. 05). The treatment increased pyridinoline and pentosidine cross-links in the lesions but significantly reduced the collagen content (P = 0. 05). CONCLUSION: This is the first demonstration that, in addition to its fungicidal activity, terbinafine acts in vivo as an antifibrotic drug.

In the present {{absence of any}} curative therapy, a recent case report describing the efficacy of cladribine showed promising results. In a pilot study, the efficacy of cladribine (0. 10 - 0. 13 mg/kg in a 2 -hour infusion, days 1 - 5; repeated at 4 - 8 weeks until 6 cycles) was studied. Ten patients with SM with severe symptoms were treated. Four patients were classified as having indolent or smoldering mastocytosis, 3 as having aggressive {{systemic mastocytosis}}, and 3 as having SM with an accompanying hematologic malignancy. Nine patients received 6 courses, 1 patient stopped because of toxicodermia.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> hormones, androgens <b>metabolites</b> <b>and</b> testosterone/epitestosterone ratio profiles after testosterone {{administration in}} male hypogonadal volunteers, and {{to evaluate their}} possible usefulness in detecting doping with testosterone in treated hypogonadal athletes. DESIGN: Controlled open label design vs placebo; pharmacokinetic study. PARTICIPANTS: Ten male volunteers affected by severe hypogonadism (serum testosterone < 2. 31 ng/ml). INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> parameters were evaluated, by radioimmunoassay and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, before and at different time points for 7 / 3 weeks after a single administration of testosterone enanthate (250 mg) or placebo, respectively. RESULTS: As partially known, testosterone administration increased, with great individual variability, urinary concentrations of glucuronide testosterone, androsterone, etiocholanolone, 5 alpha-androstane- 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol, 5 beta-androstane- 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol, testosterone/ epitestosterone and testosterone/LH ratios; and decreased epitestosterone and 5 alpha-androstane- 3 beta, 17 beta-diol/ 5 beta-androstane- 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol ratio. <b>Serum</b> testosterone <b>and</b> dihydrotestosterone increased in all volunteers, and concentrations higher than the upper reference limits were observed in many volunteers until 2 weeks after testosterone administration. CONCLUSION: Whereas the observed prolonged hyperandrogenism partially limited data interpretation, the report ed characteristics of variation of urinary parameters {{might be used to}} suspect testosterone misuse in hypogonadal athletes treated with testosterone enanthate. In this sense, while the actual threshold for tes tos terone/epites tos ter one ratio was confirmed to be of reduced usefulness, we suggest a contemporary evaluation of whole <b>urinary</b> androgen <b>metabolites</b> profile <b>and</b> <b>serum</b> androgens, at specific time points after testosterone enanthate administration. Moreover, an adequate tailoring of treatment, to avoid transitory hyperandrogenism, is highly advisable.

40|$|Introduction Pancreatic {{cancer is}} a devastating disease with a poor outcome. Current {{biomarkers}} fall short in accessibility, sensitivity, specificity {{and their ability to}} distinguish malignant from benign conditions. Metabolomics aims to decipher molecular signatures that will distinguish disease from controls, ultimately leading to novel targets for diagnosis and treatment. The aim of this novel study was to characterise potentially new pancreatic cancer biomarkers. Method Urine <b>and</b> <b>serum</b> samples from 32 patients with pancreatic cancer (PC), were compared with healthy controls and patients with chronic pancreatitis and benign jaundice. Two analytical platforms, UHPLC-MS and GC-TOF-MS, were used in this study in order to minimise false negatives and identify a quantitative compliment of all metabolites across a wide molecular weight range. GC-TOF-MS can identify very low molecular weight polar metabolites < 350 Da, where-as reverse phase UHPLC-MS is useful in resolving and detecting non-polar metabolites. Subsequent metabolite identification was subject to univariate and multivariate analysis (p < 0. 05). Results After univariate analysis, a total of 747 <b>serum</b> <b>metabolites</b> <b>and</b> 638 <b>urinary</b> <b>metabolites</b> were identified as significantly different in comparison to healthy controls. When chronic pancreatitis and benign jaundice controls were used for comparison to pancreatic cancer then 185 <b>and</b> 176 <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> 333 <b>and</b> 51 <b>urinary</b> <b>metabolites</b> were identified as statistically significant at differentiating these groups respectively. Multivariate analysis showed good discrimination between resectable and non-resectable cases, based on metabolite profile. Urine profiles, in particular, showed consistent separation between resectable and non-resectable disease. When participants without definitive pathology were removed from analysis, the separation improved further. It was so clear that only an unsupervised PCA analysis was sufficient to visualise group separation. Importantly there {{did not seem to be}} any effect from diabetes or jaundice on the differentiation of metabolite profiles. Conclusion In this novel study, metabolite profiling can distinguish patients with pancreatic cancer from controls. Furthermore, multivariate analysis of metabolite profiles is able to distinguish resectable from irresectable disease with 95...|$|R
40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{a common}} malignancy {{in the world with}} high morbidity and mortality rate. Identification of novel biomarkers in HCC remains impeded primarily because of the heterogeneity of the disease in clinical presentations as well as the pathophysiological variations derived from underlying conditions such as cirrhosis and steatohepatitis. The aim {{of this study is to}} search for potential metabolite biomarkers of human HCC using <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> urine metabolomics approach. Sera and urine samples were collected from patients with HCC (n = 82), benign liver tumor patients (n = 24), and healthy controls (n = 71). Metabolite profiling was performed by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry in conjunction with univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Forty three <b>serum</b> <b>metabolites</b> <b>and</b> 31 <b>urinary</b> <b>metabolites</b> were identified in HCC patients involving several key metabolic pathways such as bile acids, free fatty acids, glycolysis, urea cycle, and methionine metabolism. Differentially expressed metabolites in HCC subjects, such as bile acids, histidine, and inosine are of great statistical significance and high fold changes, which warrant further validation as potential biomarkers for HCC. However, alterations of several bile acids seem to be affected by the condition of liver cirrhosis and hepatitis. Quantitative measurement and comparison of seven bile acids among benign liver tumor patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatitis, HCC patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatitis, HCC patients without liver cirrhosis and hepatitis, and healthy controls revealed that the abnormal levels of glycochenodeoxycholic acid, glycocholic acid, taurocholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid are associated with liver cirrhosis and hepatitis. HCC patients with alpha fetoprotein values lower than 20 ng/ml was successfully differentiated from healthy controls with an accuracy of 100 % using a panel of metabolite markers. Our work shows that metabolomic profiling approach is a promising screening tool for the diagnosis and stratification of HCC patients...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is a triad of anovulation, insulin resistance, and hyperandrogenism. Androgen excess may {{correlate with}} metabolic risk and PCOS consensus criteria define androgen excess {{on the basis}} of serum T. Here we studied the utility of the androgen precursor serum androstenedione (A) in conjunction with serum T for predicting metabolic dysfunction in PCOS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-six PCOS patients fulfilling Rotterdam diagnostic consensus criteria and 43 age- and body mass index-matched controls underwent measurement of serum androgens by tandem mass spectrometry and an oral glucose tolerance test with homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity index calculation. We analyzed 24 -hour urine androgen excretion by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: PCOS patients had higher levels of <b>serum</b> androgens <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> androgen <b>metabolites</b> than controls (all P <. 001). Within the PCOS cohort, both <b>serum</b> A <b>and</b> T were positively correlated with the free androgen index (T × 100 /SHBG) and total androgen metabolite excretion (all P <. 001). All subjects with T above the normal reference range [high T (HT) ] also had high A (HA/HT group, n = 56). However, the remaining 30 patients had normal T levels, either in the presence of HA (HA/NT; n = 20) or normal A (NA/NT; n = 10). The groups did not differ in age or BMI. The HA/HT and HA/NT groups had higher total androgen excretion than NA/NT (P <. 01 and P <. 05, respectively). Multiple linear regression showed a strong negative association between <b>serum</b> androstenedione <b>and</b> insulin sensitivity. The incidence of dysglycemia according to an oral glucose tolerance test increased with the severity of androgen phenotype (NA/NT, 0 %; HA/NT, 14 %; HA/HT, 25 %, P =. 03). CONCLUSION: Simultaneous measurement of <b>serum</b> T <b>and</b> A represents a useful tool for predicting metabolic risk in PCOS women.

The objective {{of this study is}} to prove that the increase in <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> NGAL are correlated with kidney tubular epithelial damage, and this increase has occurred in initiation phase, indicated by rat kidney histopathology in an early I/R model. Methods: Twenty eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: 4 hour sham (Sham 4), 8 hour sham (Sham 8), 10 minute ischemia 4 hour reperfusion (I/R 4) and 10 minute ischemia 8 hour reperfusion (I/R 8). Blood, urine and kidney samples were collected. Serum creatinine level was analyzed with Jaffe method, while <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> NGAL level were analyzed with direct sandwich ELISA method. Evaluation of kidney damage were measured semi quantitatively in tissue stained with HE.

40|$|ABSTRAcr The {{results of}} the {{analysis}} of blood and urine samples for styrene and its metabolites in 491 workers in a styrene polymerisation plant in the United States are reported. The levels of exposure to styrene were estimated {{to be less than}} 10 ppm, but nevertheless styrene and metabolites were detectable in more than 50 % of workers in polymerisation jobs, within 4 h of exposure. Workers involved in the manufacture and purification of styrene from ethyl benzene also had detect-able blood styrene <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>metabolites</b> in 83 % of recently exposed subjects. The relationship between styrene in blood and in subcutaneous fat <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>metabolites</b> as pharmacokinetic variables is discussed. Various indices of human exposure to organic solvents have been investigated in recent years in recognition of the fact that air sample analysis, even at best, may be an inadequate measure of individual environmental exposure. This results from the fre-quent difficulty of obtaining an accurate or repre-sentative pessonal sample and of the many changes in levels of exposure during actual working con-ditions over short periods of time. At the same time the non-uniformity of human responses, even to similar exposure levels, has been noted. Individual variation in absorption, distribution, storage, metabolism and excretion can be marked. Efforts to assess individual exposure quantita-tively have dealt with measurement of unaltered materials (such as styrene, benzene, dichloromethane, trichloroethylene and various anaesthetics) in ex-pired air and blood, <b>and</b> of <b>urinary</b> <b>metabolites</b> including trichloroacetic acid (for trichloroethylene), phenols (for benzene), hippuric acid (for toluene), and mandelic or phenylglyoxylic acid (for styrene...|$|R

40|$|Objective. The {{physiology}} of iron metabolism in Wilson's disease is largely unknown, {{and there is}} a paucity of data on the real presence and progression of iron accumulation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the iron metabolism parameters, including hepatic iron concentration, in follow-up liver biopsies <b>and</b> <b>serum,</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> pro-hepcidin. Material <b>and</b> methods. Twenty-three Wilson's disease patients undergoing long-term treatment were enrolled in the study. Results. Hepatic iron content was significantly increased in penicillamine-treated patients compared with zinc-treated patients. <b>Serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> pro-hepcidin concentrations were significantly higher in Wilson's disease patients than in healthy volunteers, despite a normal biochemical pattern of iron metabolism. Conclusions. Long-term penicillamine treatment seems to be responsible for a more marked iron accumulation in the liver. This observation may justify a revision of long-term Wilson's disease treatment modalities with penicillamine. The finding that <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> pro-hepcidin is significantly increased in Wilson's disease patients compared with healthy volunteers suggests a role for hepcidin in iron metabolism in Wilson's disease, but this needs to be confirmed by a study of hepatic hepcidin expression in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Advanced glycoxidation end-products (AGEs) are {{involved}} in age-related conditions and diabetic complications. Diet intake contributes to their circulating concentrations. Aim: To measure <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> AGEs in non-diabetic volunteers and relate their concentration to body composition, blood chemistry and dietary ingestión. Methods: We studied 41 adult men (31 middle-aged adults and 10 elderly). A nutritional assessment including a dietary recall designed for detection of AGE ingestión (specifically carboxymethyl-lysine(CML)), and anthropometric measurements were performed. Also serum lipoproteins, insulin, glucose, leptin and C reactive protein (CRP). AGEs were measured in <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> urine samples using size exclusion chromatography and flow injection assay (FIA); the technical procedures were first employed in 11 heterogeneous diabetics, as positive controls for this methodology. Results: <b>Serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> chromatograms indicated that areas under the curve were not different in younger compared with elderly adults. AGEs did not correlate with dietary intake, body composition, nor metabolic parameters, however they correlated significantly with renal function and CRP concentration. Discussion: In these non-diabetic volunteers, with low CML intake, <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> concentration of AGEs were not related to dietary intake. AGEs were related to renal function and CRP, but not to body composition, lipoproteins, insulin and glucos...|$|R
40|$|Background. In dentistry, titanium, mercury, platinum, rhodium and {{palladium}} {{are used}} to produce dental fillings.

40|$|ABSTRACT Acute {{effect of}} the {{ingestion}} of 80 g each of casein, lactalbumin, and soybean isolate on <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> uric acid concentrations was investigated in 10 healthy subjects. <b>Serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> uric acid concentrations were measured be-fore and after the ingestion ofproteins. Serum uric acid decreased significantly 3 h after ingestion of lactalbumin and casein but increased after soybean consumption. Urate clearance was sig-nificantly increased after ingestion ofeach ofthe three proteins. Multivariate analysis of urate clearance during lactalbumin and casein loads showed that independent correlation was obtained for <b>serum</b> alanine <b>and</b> urea concentration. These results dem-onstrate that, {{in addition to their}} known uricosuric effect, milk proteins acutely decrease serum uric acid concentration. Analysis of the effects of lactalbumin <b>and</b> casein on <b>urinary</b> uric acid elimination suggests that the uricosuric effect of proteins is...|$|R
