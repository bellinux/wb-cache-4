For greater success in lowering the erosion, contour strips on the slopes need to follow {{the contours of the}} landscape. Row crops like corn, legumes, or soybeans should alternate strips of small grains or forages to successfully limit erosion and slowing or capturing the runoff of fertilizers and pesticides. [...] Tests from the NRCS have shown that the smaller tighter rooted grasses and hays provide more surface cover to prevent rain and wind erosion while slowing runoff, increasing infiltration, and trapping sediment from the high erosive row crops. Proper planting of the contour crops is important for higher success of erosion control to protect highly fertile topsoil.|$|E

With <b>strip</b> <b>cropping,</b> the trees or shrubs are planted in wide strip. The purpose can be, as with alley cropping, to provide nutrients, in leaf form, to the crop. With <b>strip</b> <b>cropping,</b> the trees can have a purely productive role, providing fruits, nuts, etc. while, at the same time, protecting nearby crops from soil erosion and harmful winds.|$|E

50|$|In {{irrigated}} lands with scarce {{water resources}} suffering from drainage (high water table) and soil salinity problems, <b>strip</b> <b>cropping</b> is sometimes practiced with strips of land where every other strip is irrigated while the strips in between are left permanently fallow.|$|E
50|$|<b>Strip</b> <b>cropping</b> is {{a method}} of farming which {{involves}} cultivating a field partitioned into long, narrow strips which are alternated in a crop rotation system. It is used when a slope is too steep or {{when there is no}} alternative method of preventing soil erosion. The most common crop choices for <b>strip</b> <b>cropping</b> are closely sown crops such as hay, wheat, or other forages which are alternated with strips of row crops, such as corn, soybeans, cotton, or sugar beets. The forages serve primarily as cover crops. In certain systems, strips in particularly eroded areas are used to grow permanent protective vegetation; in most systems, however, all strips are alternated on an annual basis.|$|E

The experiment was a randomized complete block design (RCBD), replicated three times and treatments used were: Sole Maize (M), Desmodium (D) and Soybeans (S); Maize-soybeans intercrop (MS), Maize-Desmodium intercrop (MD), Maize <b>Strip</b> <b>cropped</b> with Soybean (MS 2 : 4) and Maize <b>Strip</b> <b>cropped</b> with Desmodium (MD 2 : 4). Data obtained were evaluated for Organic carbon, carbon stock, Bulk density and mean weight diameter of aggregates in the soil. Results obtained show that Mono-crop (Sole) Maize treatment gave significantly higher BD than other treatments at 8 WAP and 16 WAP, suggesting that soils under sole maize were degraded for sustainable crop production. Organic carbon sequestered over 2014 to 2015 was least under MD and highest under MD 2 : 4 treatments and mean carbon stock sequestered in the macro and micro aggregates was highest under MD 2 : 4 (28. 35 t Cha- 1) and least under MD (8. 82 t Cha- 1). Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestered in macro aggregates under MS (1. 38 gkg- 1) {{were significantly higher than}} the other treatments.

As such, fine line patterns within weather radar imagery, associated with converging winds, are dominated by insect returns. [...] In the Great Plains, wind erosion of agricultural land is a significant problem, and is mainly driven by the prevailing wind.

[...] The strips can be in the form of soil ridges, <b>crop</b> <b>strips,</b> <b>crops</b> rows, or trees which act as wind breaks.

50|$|<b>Strip</b> <b>cropping</b> {{helps to}} stop soil erosion by {{creating}} natural dams for water, helping {{to preserve the}} strength of the soil. Certain layers of plants will absorb minerals and water from the soil more effectively than others. When water reaches the weaker soil that lacks the minerals needed to make it stronger, it normally washes it away. When strips of soil are strong enough to slow down water from moving through them, the weaker soil can't wash away like it normally would. Because of this, farmland stays fertile much longer.|$|E

In the present study, the numerical response of E. connexa {{to changes in}} aphid density on wheat crops with high and low plant diversity was investigated. The study {{was carried out in}} Balcarce, Buenos Aires, Argentina, from September to December 2007 and 2008, on two wheat crops with either a higher plant diversity (HPD) with refuge strips or a lower plant diversity (LPD) without refuge <b>strips.</b> <b>Crops</b> were sampled every week and the abundance of aphids and E. connexa was recorded. The dominant aphid species were Schizaphis graminum, Metopolophium dirhodum, and Sitobion avenae. Eriopis connexa showed a linear increase in the numerical response to an increase in aphid density, which varied in space and time. The abundance of E. connexa increased in relation to the crop development and aphid population and was higher in the HPD than in the LPD system. This predator increased its reproductive numerical response only in 2008, with a significant liner response in the HPD system.

50|$|The term <b>strip</b> <b>cropping</b> also {{refers to}} a method of dry farming {{sometimes}} used in areas including parts of the Great Plains of the United States and the Prairies of Canada. To accumulate moisture in these dry areas, cropland is periodically left fallow. Typically, the fallow and planted areas are organized in parallel long, narrow strips that are oriented normal to the prevailing winds, {{in order to minimize}} the erosion of soil from the bare fields. Strip farming helps to prevent mass erosion by having the roots of crops hold on to the soil to prevent it from being washed away.|$|E

40|$|Eighty {{three percent}} of the {{strawberries}} consumed in North America are grown in California, where {{the widespread use of}} insecticides has become hazardous to public health. The intensive use of pesticides for growing strawberries causes serious health risks to farm workers, in addition to contaminating the soil and groundwater. The cost to the environment and public health in the United States is estimated at $ 12 billion annually. Finding effective nontoxic management strategies for insect pests has become essential for long term sustainability. One strategy strawberry producers can use to promote sustainability is to increase the effectiveness of biological control techniques. Field experiments in other crops suggest that arachnid diversity and abundance may provide such a role in controlling insect pests and that agroecosystem diversification can enhance arachnid populations. This study therefore evaluated the composition, abundance, and pest control potential of arachnid communities in an organic strawberry field in California. The study found that by integrating alfalfa trap crops into organic strawberries, arachnid populations were substantially increased. Results reflected substantial increases in both male and female arachnid populations in and near alfalfa <b>strip</b> <b>crops,</b> with spider and harvestman arachnid families increasing most dramatically.

As an initial step towards developing an insect resistance management (IRM) plan for the pest moth, Helicoverpa armigera, on Bt-cotton {{in this part of}} China, we assessed the potential of six crops grown in two configurations to act as refuge hosts for susceptible moth production in both broad-acre and small-holder farms.
