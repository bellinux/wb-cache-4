5000|$|Production {{of primary}} {{aluminium}} metal with the Hall-Héroult process involves the electrolytic reduction of alumina in cells or pots. The electrolyte {{is made up}} of molten cryolite and other additives. The electrolyte is contained in a carbon and refractory lining in a steel potshell. The pots typically have a life of 2 to 6 years. Eventually the cell fails and the potlining (SPL) is removed and replaced. The SPL generated is listed by various environmental bodies as hazardous waste. [...] Due to the concentrations of ﬂuorides and cyanides in spent potliner, and the tendency to leach in contact with water, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) listed the materials on 13 September 1988 (53 Fed. Reg. 35412) as a hazardous waste (K088) under 40 C.F.R., Part 261, <b>Subpart</b> <b>D.</b> International shipment of SPL is subject to the protocols of the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. As the environmental regulation agencies in an increasing number of countries define SPL as a hazardous material, the disposal costs can easily run to more than $1000 per tonne SPL.World production of primary aluminium is in the order of 40 million tonnes. The world’s smelters also produce about one million tonnes of toxic SPL waste. Past industry practice has been to landfill this waste. This must change if the aluminium industry wants to claim a reasonable degree of sustainability and environmentally tolerable emissions. Landfill of unreacted SPL is considered a practice of the past.|$|E
40|$|Particulate matter (PM) {{is one of}} the six {{criteria}} pollutants regulated {{under the}} National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Regional compliance with PM NAAQS is monitored using networks of Federal Reference Method (FRM) designated PM 10 sampling inlets. Several previous studies have suggested that FRM PM 10 inlets sampling PM from rural sources will not perform as designed and that a significant number of particles with larger diameters will penetrate the inlet. This research sought to characterize a common FRM PM 10 inlet, the SA 246 b, using a combination of the original developmental steps, FRM designation testing procedures, and new techniques. The wind tunnel originally used as part of the designing and testing of the SA 246 b was reassembled and evaluated against <b>Subpart</b> <b>D</b> standards. The SA 246 b was evaluated as described in <b>Subpart</b> <b>D</b> at a wind speed of 8 km h^- 1 with two adjustments: an aerosol particle sizer and testing times were specifically scheduled to meet minimum signal requirements. Measured and corrected data showed that particles with diameters of 20 and 25 micrometers had non-trivial penetration of 5. 7 % and 3. 5 %, respectively. A lognormal curve was found to be most descriptive of the collected data (p-value of 0. 686). The <b>Subpart</b> <b>D</b> mass concentration analysis yielded a concentration of 152. 694 ?g m^- 3 which was within 10 % of the ideal concentration value, 143. 889 ?g m^- 3. When the empirical SA 246 b lognormal performance curve was applied to the PSDs for several different rural PM sources, the mass concentration values for those sources were between 10 % and 34 % greater than that of the <b>Subpart</b> <b>D</b> ideal mass concentration. It was determined that the impact of large particle penetration was non-trivial and dependent upon the PSD of the PM being sampled. A low volume total suspended particulate (LVTSP) inlet developed at Texas A&M University was evaluated in the <b>Subpart</b> <b>D</b> wind tunnel in an effort to fully characterize the true performance of the inlet. The inlet was evaluated at wind speeds of 2, 8, and 24 km h^- 1 according to the procedures of <b>Subpart</b> <b>D</b> and the experimental additions employed during the SA 246 b testing. It was determined that piecewise models were more descriptive across all three wind speeds (p-values were greater than 0. 84). Data collected in the wind tunnel was shown to be wind speed dependent and no further analysis of inlet performance was conducted. It was concluded that further analysis of the wind tunnel at the wind speeds of two and 24 km h^- 1 need to be conducted before further studies could be reliable. Computational fluid dynamics was used to analyze the performance of the impactor section (the lower section) of the SA 246 b FRM PM 10 inlet for the particle sizes listed in <b>Subpart</b> <b>D.</b> The CFD for the impactor assembly produced a cutpoint of 14. 79 micrometers and a performance slope of 1. 19 resulting in a 34. 88 % higher mass concentration for CFD results than the ideal <b>Subpart</b> <b>D</b> inlet mass concentration. This result is outside the 10 % difference allowed. It was concluded that the characterization of the inlet must include the aspirator as well as the impactor section as the aspirator assembly also has sampling performance characteristics...|$|E

It is up to tank owners and operators to select a method of leak detection that has been shown to meet the relevant performance standards. Deciding whether a method meets the standards has not been easy, however. Until recently, manufacturers of leak detection methods have tested their equipment using a wide variety of approaches, some more rigorous than others.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) face numerous {{challenges in}} school with impairments in behavioral, social, and academic functioning. This vulnerable population of students is often served by <b>Subpart</b> <b>D</b> of the Section 504 Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which protects {{students with disabilities}} from discrimination to allow full participation in their education. Although enacted over 40 years ago, limited research on Section 504 has been conducted, and has not examined how classroom teachers perceive the use of Section 504 plans. The {{purpose of the study}} was to ascertain teachers’ attitudes about Section 504 use for students with ADHD, perceived knowledge of Section 504 and ADHD, and interest in professional development. METHOD: Fifty-four middle school teachers from five schools within one school district completed the two-part study survey (teacher survey and demographic survey) to assess perceptions of Section 504 use for students with ADHD. RESULTS: Overall, teachers generally rated Section 504 plans feasible to implement and feel effective in implementation. They also found the plans to be helpful for students with ADHD. The majority of teachers in the sample indicated limited interest in future training related to Section 504, but strong interested in training related to childhood ADHD. Lastly, teachers’ total and mean scores on the survey components did differ significantly based on the number of course subjects taught or level of teacher experience. CONCLUSION: Teachers in the sample had generally positive perceptions Section 504 plans use for middle school students with ADHD, which may inform the development of future trainings for teachers in the district. A need for professional development opportunities in Section 504 and ADHD was identified. This exploratory study highlighted some preliminary information about teacher perspectives on Section 504 use for students with ADHD...|$|E
40|$|Since 1973, when OSHA CFRs 1910 and 1926 {{began to}} {{influence}} the workplace, confusion about {{the interpretation of the}} standards has been a problem and fall protection issues are among them. This confusion is verified by the issuance of 351 (as of 11 / 25 / 05) Standard Interpretations issued by OSHA in response to formally submitted questions asking for clarification. Over the years, many workers and too many ES&H Professionals have become 'self-interpreters', reaching conclusions that do not conform to either the Standards or the published Interpretations. One conclusion that has been reached by the author is that many ES&H Professionals are either not aware of, or do not pay attention to the Standard Interpretations issued by OSHA, or the State OSHA interpretation mechanism, whoever has jurisdiction. If you fall in this category, you are doing your organization or clients a disservice and are not providing them with the best information available.

40|$|This Advisory Circular (AC) {{provides}} guidance on certain land uses {{that have the}} potential to attract hazardous wildlife on or near public-use airports. It also discusses airport development projects (including airport construction, expansion, and renovation) affecting aircraft movement near hazardous wildlife attractants. Appendix 1 provides definitions of terms used in this AC. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommends that public-use airport operators implement the standards and practices contained in this AC. The holders of Airport Operating Certificates issued under Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 139, Certification of Airports, <b>Subpart</b> <b>D</b> (Part 139), may use the standards, practices, and recommendations contained in this AC to comply with the wildlife hazard management requirements of Part 139. Airports that have received Federal grant-in-aid assistance must use these standards. The FAA also recommends the guidance in this AC for land-use planners, operators of non-certificated airports, and developers of projects, facilities, and activities on or near airports. Most public-use airports have large tracts of open, undeveloped land that provide added margins of safety and noise mitigation. These areas can also present potential hazards to aviation if they encourage wildlife to enter an airport 2 ̆ 7 s approach or departure airspace or air operations area (AOA). Constructed or natural areas—such as poorly drained locations, detention/retention ponds, roosting habitats on buildings, landscaping, odor-causing rotting organic matter (putrescible waste) disposal operations, wastewater treatment plants, agricultural or aquaculture activities, surface mining, or wetlands—can provide wildlife with ideal locations for feeding, loafing, reproduction, and escape. Even small facilities, such as fast food restaurants, taxicab staging areas, rental car facilities, aircraft viewing areas, and public parks, can produce substantial attractions for hazardous wildlife. During the past century, wildlife-aircraft strikes have resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives worldwide, as well as billions of dollars in aircraft damage. Hazardous wildlife attractants on and near airports can jeopardize future airport expansion, making proper community land-use planning essential. This AC provides airport operators and those parties with whom they cooperate with the guidance they need to assess and address potentially hazardous wildlife attractants when locating new facilities and implementing certain land-use practices on or near public-use airports...|$|E
40|$|This Comment {{focuses on}} two main issues: {{environmental}} justice 2 ̆ 7 s procedural limitations following Alexander v. Sandoval, and the loopholes within existing environmental legislation as {{they apply to}} military activities. In this respect, Richard Armour 2 ̆ 7 s famous idiom 2 ̆ 2 hindsight is 20 / 202 ̆ 2 is telling. As long as the military has carte blanche to ignore environmental laws, environmental justice will continue to remain a legal mirage beholden to the government 2 ̆ 7 s pecking order of judicial deference. Vague notions of national security and deference to the military wrinkle the fabric of environmental laws that are intended to create safe and healthy communities. Legislators must close loopholes in environmental laws, codify the Order, and explicitly create a private cause of action for disparate-impact plaintiffs so that environmental justice can finally be achieved. Subpart A of the Argument describes existing military exceptions from environmental laws. Of particular concern is the military 2 ̆ 7 s invocation of 2 ̆ 2 national security 2 ̆ 2 {{to opt out of}} environmental laws. Despite congressional intent to limit national security waivers to exceptional and emergency contexts, courts interpret security needs broadly. Subpart A also highlights the concern for environmental justice proponents when faced with national security waivers. Subpart B examines the procedural limitations that environmental justice advocates experience through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Then, Subpart C discusses why super-deference to the military under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) is of particular concern to environmental justice proponents. <b>Subpart</b> <b>D</b> focuses on Alexander v. Sandoval, a Supreme Court case that limited private causes of action for disparate-impact claims. Following Alexander v. Sandoval, there are three ways for communities to fight environmental justice. First, communities facing disproportionate environmental hazards must prove that the government intentionally discriminated against them. Second, claimants may seek redress through Title VI 2 ̆ 7 s administrative review process. However, because intentional discrimination is so difficult to prove and Title VI 2 ̆ 7 s administrative review process rarely results in a finding for the claimants, these options are inadequate. Third, claimants may seek alternatives to the court and administrative systems to combat disparate impacts of environmental hazards facing their communities. Finally, Subpart E discusses these alternatives, which include avoiding 2 ̆ 2 lawyer-centered 2 ̆ 2 models by advocating grassroots activism and community partnerships with the military...|$|E
