25|$|The {{exponential}} horn has an acoustic loading property {{that allows the}} <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> to remain evenly balanced in output level over its frequency range. The benefits of the design were first published by C.R. Hanna and J. Slepian in 1924 for the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). A major drawback is that the {{exponential horn}} allows for a narrowing of the radiation pattern as frequency increases, making for high frequency 'beaming' on axis and dull sound off axis. Another concern is that a throat of small diameter is needed for high efficiency at high frequencies but a larger throat is best for low frequencies. A common solution is to use two or more horns, each with the appropriate throat size, mouth size and flare rate for best performance in a selected frequency range, with sufficient overlap between the frequency ranges to provide a smooth transition between horns. Another solution tried in the late 1930s by Harry F. Olson of RCA was to use multiple exponential flare rates, either by connecting increasingly larger horns in series or by subdividing {{the interior of a}} single horn. Exponential horns continue to be used by some designers, and in some applications.|$|E
500|$|A {{subwoofer}} (or sub) is a woofer, or {{a complete}} loudspeaker, which {{is dedicated to}} the reproduction of low-pitched audio frequencies known as bass. The typical frequency range for a subwoofer is about 20–200Hz for consumer products, below 100Hz for professional live sound, and below 80Hz in THX-approved systems. Subwoofers are intended to augment the low frequency range of loudspeakers covering higher frequency bands. While the term [...] "subwoofer" [...] technically only refers to the <b>speaker</b> <b>driver,</b> in common parlance, the term often refers to a subwoofer driver mounted in a speaker enclosure (cabinet).|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Charlie Hughes of Peavey Electronics {{filed for}} a patent on a hybrid horn he called Quadratic-Throat Waveguide. The horn was {{basically}} a simple conic section but its throat was curved {{in a circular arc}} to match the desired throat size for proper mating to the <b>speaker</b> <b>driver.</b> Instead of increasing the horn mouth size with a flare to control midrange beaming, a relatively thin layer of foam covering the mouth edge was found to suit the same end. The QT waveguide, when compared to popular CD horns, produced about [...] lower levels of second harmonic distortion across all frequencies, and an average of [...] lower levels of the more annoying third harmonic distortion. Being without a diffraction slot, the QT waveguide was free from problems with apparent apex, making it arrayable as needed for public address purposes.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the century, Vifa {{produced}} several high-end <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers</b> {{which are}} used by brands like Aerial Acoustics and Apogee Electronics.|$|R
50|$|Internally, it {{features}} a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, four front-facing <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers,</b> and two opposing passive radiators (one each front- and back-facing).|$|R
2500|$|A horn {{loudspeaker}} is a loudspeaker or loudspeaker element which uses an acoustic horn {{to increase the}} overall efficiency of the driving element(s). A common form (right) consists of a compression driver which produces sound waves with a small metal diaphragm vibrated by an electromagnet, attached to a horn, a flaring duct to conduct the sound waves to the open air. Another type is a woofer driver mounted in a loudspeaker enclosure which is divided by internal partitions to form a zigzag flaring duct which functions as a horn; this type is called a folded horn speaker. The horn serves to improve the coupling efficiency between the <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> and the air. The horn {{can be thought of}} as an [...] "acoustic transformer" [...] that provides impedance matching between the relatively dense diaphragm material and the less-dense air. The result is greater acoustic output power from a given driver.|$|E
2500|$|Headphones {{may be used}} {{to prevent}} other people from hearing the sound either for privacy or to prevent disturbance, as in {{listening}} in a public library. They can also provide a level of sound fidelity greater than loudspeakers of similar cost. Part of their ability to do so comes from the lack of any need to perform room correction treatments with headphones. High-quality headphones can have an extremely flat low-frequency response down to 20Hz within 3dB. While a loudspeaker must use a relatively large (often 15" [...] or 18") <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> to reproduce low frequencies, headphones can accurately reproduce bass and sub-bass frequencies with speaker drivers only 40-50 millimeters wide (or much smaller, {{as is the case with}} in-ear monitor headphones). Headphones' impressive low-frequency performance is possible because they are so much closer to the ear that only relatively small volumes of air need to be moved.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also used}} by <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> {{manufacturers}} as the material for Low Damping Rubber Surrounds.|$|E
50|$|Practical {{speakers}} demand {{production of}} fairly high volumes from fairly small cabinets, a combination {{that is difficult}} to achieve using ultrasonic <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{large number}} of <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers</b> in the array, and the equally {{large number of}} {{amplifier}} channels to drive them makes for a pricey system.|$|R
50|$|Even {{accounting}} for the vastly lower efficiency of <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers</b> at such high frequencies, the result was to generate an unacceptably high level of ultrasonics accompanying the desired output.|$|R
50|$|The forward- and rearward-{{generated}} {{sounds of}} a <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> appear out of phase from each other because they are generated through opposite motion of the diaphragm and because they travel different paths before converging at the listener's position. A <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> mounted on a finite baffle will display a physical phenomenon known as interference which {{can result in a}} perceivable frequency-dependent sound attenuation. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable at low frequencies where the wavelengths are large enough that interference will affect the entire listening area.|$|E
50|$|The {{expense of}} a {{multiple}} driver loudspeaker is typically higher than a reflector-type parabolic dish due to the increased number of <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> components and amplifier channels.|$|E
50|$|Limitations of {{parabolic}} reflector loudspeakers include {{the fact that}} they are comparatively large and bulky, and that they have a fixed beam width with no ability to broaden or narrow the coverage pattern without changing the curvature of the dish. Their beam width is wider for low frequencies than it is for high frequencies, so at the periphery of the coverage pattern there is a region of sound coverage that doesn't receive the full strength of the high frequencies. In addition, some frequencies are reflected more efficiently than others, so the frequency response is uneven unless audio signal processing correction is applied before the signal reaches the amplifier. The presence and placement of the <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> prevents the center of the parabolic dish from reflecting sound outward, as that sound would reflect back into the <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> itself. In some loudspeaker designs, a hole is cut at the center of the parabolic dish, or damping material placed, such that no sound is reflected directly at the <b>speaker</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|E
50|$|From 2002, {{production}} was relocated in Saint-Etienne where {{about three-quarters of}} production still takes place {{with the aim of}} equipping every loudspeaker with « Made in France » <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers.</b>|$|R
50|$|GP Industries {{is mainly}} {{engaged in the}} development, {{manufacture}} and marketing of electronics and acoustics products, like KEF consumer speakers and Celestion professional <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers,</b> as well as automotive wire harness.|$|R
5000|$|HiWave Technologies PLC was a UK-based {{manufacturer}} of audio and haptic-based products. It developed haptic control and high efficiency audio [...] applications {{as well as}} <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers</b> and haptic feedback actuators.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} control {{resonance}} {{and to reduce}} medium <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> distortions, the Tuned Mass Damper technology consists of an additional mass that oscillates {{in opposition to the}} resonance frequency. The suspension is optimised to avoid distortions and increase the definition.|$|E
50|$|In a loudspeaker, a phase plug, phasing plug or {{acoustical}} transformer is {{a mechanical}} interface between a <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> and the audience. The phase plug extends high frequency response because it guides waves outward toward the listener rather than {{allowing them to}} interact destructively near the driver.|$|E
50|$|A {{hearing aid}} {{incorporates}} a miniature microphone {{and a very}} small <b>speaker</b> <b>driver,</b> and various conditions may increase or decrease the amount of gain {{that can be applied}} to the microphone signal before the system feeds back. A well-fitted hearing aid has more GBF than one that is loose. The shape of the earmold is a factor, with larger and heavier designs capable of delivering greater GBF. Hearing aid designs deliver gain in increasing steps depending on the severity of the patient's hearing loss; the range spans from 10 dB to 65 dB of gain. To prevent feedback with the highest amounts of gain, such designs require the tightest-fitting earmolds with no venting, and the deepest penetration of the ear canal to place the <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> as close as practical to the eardrum.|$|E
50|$|Focal-JMlab, a {{research}} office dedicated to acoustic first {{was founded in}} 1979 in Paris by engineer, high-fidelity enthusiast and technology journalist Jacques Mahul. He began making his first <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers</b> in a small workshop in Saint-Etienne, at a precision mechanics company, which belonged to his father. Whilst producing his <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers,</b> Jacques Mahul also launched his own range of loudspeakers under the brand JMlab. His first loudspeaker, the DB13, was a bookshelf loudspeaker, which produced volumes comparable to larger loudspeakers, particularly in bass frequencies. Initially, he only sold his product to acquaintances but the DB13 was soon launched on the market.|$|R
50|$|Focal-JMlab is a French company, {{which has}} been {{designing}} and selling high-fidelity audio systems since the early 1980s. This Saint-Étienne based company manufactures loudspeakers for the home, <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers</b> for automobiles, headphones and professional monitoring loudspeakers.|$|R
50|$|Focal pooled its {{skills and}} {{technologies}} with the American manufacturer of guitars Fender {{in the framework}} if {{the creation of a}} portable monitoring speaker, Passport Studio. Launched in 2014, this monitor is equipped with Focal <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers</b> and components.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary role}} of the {{enclosure}} is to prevent sound waves generated by the rearward-facing surface of the diaphragm of an open <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> interacting with sound waves generated {{at the front of}} the <b>speaker</b> <b>driver.</b> Because the forward- and rearward-generated sounds are out of phase with each other, any interaction between the two in the listening space creates a distortion of the original signal as it was intended to be reproduced. As such, a loudspeaker cannot be used without installing it in a cabinet of some type, or mounting it into a wall or ceiling. Additionally, because the sound waves would travel different paths through the listening space, the sound waves in an unmounted speaker would arrive at the listener's position at slightly different times, introducing echo and reverberation effects not part of the original sound.|$|E

Horn Massive is a monophonic sound projector designed and built by artist Matt Hope.|$|E
50|$|Soft grilles can be {{made from}} any well suited cloth, weaving, stitching, foam, fabric upholsteries and other similar materials. In general, soft grilles impose little {{resistance}} on the <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> because the material is free to move synchronously with the sound waves. Because the grille is capable of absorbing this vibration, softer grilles are (in general) less prone to rattling except at extremely high sound pressure levels.|$|E
5000|$|The power {{amplifiers}} are {{directly connected to}} the <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers,</b> thereby maximizing amplifier damping control of the speaker voice coil, reducing consequences of dynamic changes in driver electrical characteristics, {{all of which are}} likely to improve the transient response of the system ...|$|R
50|$|Both combo (amp/speaker) and 'head' {{versions}} of these amplifiers were produced. The combo amplifiers are often found (as in the illustrated example) with replacement <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers,</b> the original having failed under stress, as the Roland unit was only {{just beyond the}} constraints of the amplifier output.|$|R
50|$|<b>Speaker</b> <b>drivers</b> are {{the primary}} means for sound reproduction. They are used among other places in audio {{applications}} such as loudspeakers, headphones, telephones, megaphones, instrument amplifiers, television and monitor speakers, public address systems, portable radios, toys, and in many electronics devices {{that are designed to}} emit sound.|$|R
50|$|Adding an {{identical}} and mutually coupled <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> (much {{less than a}} wavelength away from each other) and splitting the electrical power equally between the two drivers increases their combined efficiency by a maximum of 3 dB, similar to increasing {{the size of a}} single driver until the diaphragm area doubles. Multiple drivers can be more practical to increase efficiency than larger drivers since frequency response is generally proportional to driver size.|$|E
50|$|Most audible {{differences}} are subtle. If at all noticeable, benefits of bi-amping cannot be realized if passive crossover networks of a speaker system are not removed. Benefits include transients {{are less likely}} to cause amplifier overload (clipping) and/or speaker damage, and reduced intermodulation distortion, elimination of errors introduced by low frequency passive crossover, reduction of load to the load presented to the power amplifier, better matching of power amplifier and <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> and others.|$|E
5000|$|A {{super tweeter}} is a <b>speaker</b> <b>driver</b> {{intended}} to produce ultra high frequencies in a multi-driver loudspeaker system. Its {{purpose is to}} recreate a more realistic sound field, often characterized as [...] "airy-ness". Super tweeters are sometimes found in high fidelity speaker systems and sometimes even in home theater systems. They are used to supplement the sound of tweeters by reproducing frequencies which the tweeter may produce only with a narrow polar output, or perhaps with distortion.|$|E
50|$|Coaxial {{loudspeakers}} {{in professional}} audio enable sound from two drivers {{to come from}} one source. This characteristic allows a wider field of listening to a synchronized summation of <b>speaker</b> <b>drivers</b> than loudspeaker enclosures containing physically separated drivers. As well, the pattern of response is symmetric around the axis of the loudspeaker.|$|R
