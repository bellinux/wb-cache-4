25|$|Phil and Dan's {{friendship}} ends after Dan {{tells the}} police about a motor scam Phil {{was involved in}} and Phil cons Dan into signing the pub over to Peggy. Phil is unsupportive when his girlfriend, Lisa, has a miscarriage and he starts domestically abusing her by getting her sacked from her job and insists she <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>This</b> makes her dependent on him so he moves on to her best friend, Melanie Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). Lisa is paranoid that Phil is having an affair and accuses Mel of being his other woman, which she is not, at that point. However, Mel is upset by Lisa's accusation and Phil comforts her, leading to a one-night stand. Mel, however, realises {{it was a mistake}} and reconciles with Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), making Phil jealous. Lisa decides that a baby will improve their relationship so stops taking contraceptive pills but Phil wants Lisa to leave him, not get pregnant, so he admits to Lisa that he and Mel slept together. Lisa leaves, keeping quiet about her pregnancy, so when Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) suggests they tell people that the baby is his, Lisa agrees. Phil now has many enemies: Lisa; Steve, who also knows about Mel and Phil's one night stand; Ian, who Phil bullies mercilessly; Mark, who wants to avenge Lisa; and Dan. On Steve and Mel's wedding night, Phil is shot and collapses in a pool of blood. Steve is the prime suspect and is arrested but Phil, knowing Steve is innocent, confronts the real culprit, Lisa. Realising he drove her to it, Phil frames Dan. He is assisted by Ritchie Stringer (Gareth Hunt), who gives Dan the gun used to shoot Phil. Unaware that he is being set up, Dan holds Phil at gunpoint, demanding money until he is arrested for attempted murder. Steve is a witness at Dan's trial and gives evidence as agreed with Phil, further implicating Dan but he is cleared and seeks revenge by kidnapping Mel, threatening to kill her unless they pay him Â£200,000. Steve and Phil rescue Mel but Dan escapes with the money.|$|E

60|$|The brigadier {{and myself}} {{discussed}} {{the subject of}} religion at some length, when the illustrious prelate had taken his leave. I {{was told that the}} monikin world was pretty nearly equally divided into two parts, the old and the new. The latter had remained uninhabited, until within a few generations, when certain monikins, who were too good to live in the old world, emigrated in a body, and set up for themselves in the new. This, the brigadier admitted, was the Leaplow account of the matter; the inhabitants of the old countries, on the other hand, invariably maintaining that they had peopled the new countries by sending all those of their own communities there, who were not fit to <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>This</b> little obscurity {{in the history of the}} new world, he considers of no great moment, as such trifling discrepancies must always depend on the character of the historian. Leaphigh was by no means the only country in the elder monikin region. There were among others, for instance, Leapup and Leapdown; Leapover and Leapthrough; Leaplong and Leapshort; Leapround and Leapunder. Each of these countries had a religious establishment, though Leaplow, being founded on a new social principle, had none. The brigadier thought, himself, on the whole, that the chief consequences of the two systems were, that the countries which had establishments had a great reputation for possessing religion, and those that had no establishments were well enough off in the article itself, though but indifferently supplied on the score of reputation.|$|E

50|$|The {{occupational}} structure of Fakenham Magna in 1881 illustrates a clear variation in specific job categories {{depending on the}} gender of the worker. It is shown {{that the vast majority of}} male workers were engaged in agriculture, in particular as agricultural labourers, farm servants or cottagers. There is a relationship between this occupation and the surrounding environment, as Fakenham Magna is situated predominantly around farms and fields, making agriculture the most practical line of work. There is a gender inequality in terms of who was working in agriculture, as only two women were employed in this field, which is most likely due to the reliance on male workers to engage in more manual jobs in comparison to women who were more likely to <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>This</b> is supported by the chart, as â of the women are in unknown/illegible occupations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to create an {{understanding}} of the negotiation process behind the decision of who will <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> with a sick child and to develop the knowledge of the mechanisms considered to affect the negotiation process, in particular, the mechanisms likely to contribute to an uneven use of care leave. In the study six interviews were conducted with three sets of parents. These interviews were then analysed with Janet Finchâs (1989) definition of negotiation of family responsibilities. The study finds that the negotiation on care leave is a result of the negotiation of the shared view of reality. This image is in turn influenced by a number of institutional aspects such as job design, relative resources, and the couple's ideological points. Previous studies that found that relative resources, converted to salary, affects the distribution greatest. Instead the results of this study points out that the nature of work is most important for how parents divide their care leave. If one parent have work that easier can be pushed forward or to be away from, the latter tend to be the one who <b>stays</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>This</b> arrangement, however, is affected by a number of other factors.

40|$|Why do {{some people}} go to the polling station, {{sometimes}} up to several times a year, while others always prefer to <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home?</b> <b>This</b> question has launched a wide theoretical debate in both economics and political science, but convincing empirical support for the dierent models proposed is still rare. The basic rational voting model of Downs (1957) predicts zero participation because each individual vote is extremely unlikely to be pivotal. One prominent modication of this model is {{the inclusion of a}} civic duty term into the voter's utility function (Riker and Ordeshook, 1968) which has been the basis of structural ethical voting models such as Coate and Conlin (2004) and Feddersen and Sandroni (2006).

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{modernisation}} of gender arrangements and {{the restructuring of}} pension systems in the United Kingdom and Germany since the 1950 s. We firstly aim to pinpoint the time when pension programmes were apt components of the âstrong breadwinner modelâ. Secondly, we explore the assumption that pension systems are tools of stratification, by comparing {{the ways in which}} the constraints and incentives of these pension systems have been in line with typical life courses of women. Our paper argues that the constraints and incentives of pensions have altered quite significantly over time and questions whether they have appropriately been characterised as components of strong breadwinner models over the long term. In the UK the pension system only supported the strong breadwinner model until the mid- 1970 s, whilst the German system never fully supported it. In addition, it is shown that the impact of pensions on womenâs behaviour is relatively limited. At times, womenâs lives were in accordance with the male breadwinner model, and they suffered high poverty risks despite having potential access to a more modern pension regime; during other periods, their employment choices were at odds with the strong directives issued by pension regulations to <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>This</b> demonstrates the importance of taking other factors, such as cultural influences and other societal institutions into account when exploring the impact of social policies on citizensâ lives; but it also poses the question of whether pensions are really important building blocks of the breadwinner model...|$|E

Though {{there has been}} much research on this topic, few studies haveaddressed the role of seasonal migration and factors specifically relevant to women (such asnumber of children) in remittance behavior. Both issues are investigated here. Over 100 femalemigrant domestic workers living in Dakar, Senegal were given a survey on their remittancebehaviors, work, and family situations. The correlations between percent of income remittedand explanatory variables such as age, number of children, and status as a seasonal migrant, wasused to determine the characteristics of migrants who remit the most. This information was thenused to draw conclusions on migrants' motives for remitting. Three main results were established. First, status as a seasonal migrant is associated with a higher percent of income remitted relative to non-seasonal migrants, suggesting that seasonal migrants have a greater stake in their home community due to regular <b>stays</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>This</b> also reflects the idea that families use rural-urban migration as a tool for household consumption smoothing. Secondly, having asmall number of children is associated with a higher percent of income remitted relative to those with many or no children, indicating that the women with one or two young children leave them in care of their grandparents, and that remittances are a form of payment for the child's needs. Finally, migrants with a deceased father remit less than those with a living father, which supports an insurance motive...|$|R
