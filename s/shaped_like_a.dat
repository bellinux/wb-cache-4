5|$|One pendant, <b>shaped</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lantern {{with a tiny}} Crucifixion inside, {{was made}} in 16th-century Mexico, and from {{comparison}} with other pieces may originally have included Mexican feather work, a Pre-Columbian art whose craftspeople the Spanish missionaries employed in workshops for export luxury objects.|$|E

5|$|The nests, built {{entirely by}} the female, are mud {{plastered}} to cave entrances or rocky outcrops in forest ravines. The nests are often constructed from the saliva {{of the females}} mixed in with vegetable matter and mud. The nest is <b>shaped</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> concave cup. The female typically lays two white eggs. The females incubates these eggs for about 25 to 28 days.|$|E
5|$|Compactification {{can be used}} to {{construct}} models in which spacetime is effectively four-dimensional. However, not every way of compactifying the extra dimensions produces a model with the right properties to describe nature. In a viable model of particle physics, the compact extra dimensions must be <b>shaped</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Calabi–Yau manifold. A Calabi–Yau manifold is a special space which is typically taken to be six-dimensional in applications to string theory. It is named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau.|$|E
5|$|In the aye-aye, the sublingua is not <b>shaped</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> brush {{like it is}} in most lemurs. Instead, {{there is}} a {{thickened}} area along the plica mediana or lytta which has a hook-shaped structure on the end. Within cheirogaleids, the sublingua lacks cartilage, and the sublingua of the gray mouse lemur has a distinct plica mediana and ends in two lobe-like projections that lack keratinized serrations, but have three keratinized ridges which make the sublingua rigid.|$|E

5|$|The shield is {{the normal}} device for {{displaying}} {{a coat of}} arms. Clergy have used less-military shapes such as the oval cartouche, but the shield {{has always been a}} clerical option. Clergy in Italy often use a shield <b>shaped</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> horse's face-armor. Clergy in South Africa sometimes follow the national style using a Nguni shield. Women traditionally display their coats of arms on a diamond-shaped lozenge; abbesses follow this tradition or use the cartouche.|$|E
5|$|As Professor Bernard Quatermass (Brian Donlevy) {{struggles to}} gain {{government}} {{support for his}} moon colonisation project, his interest becomes focused on reports of hundreds of meteorites landing in Winnerden Flats. Travelling there with Marsh, his colleague (Bryan Forbes), Quatermass finds a huge complex under construction, based on his lunar colony plans. Marsh finds an undamaged meteorite is <b>shaped</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> small stone rocket. It then cracks open, releasing a gas, leaving him with an odd V-shaped mark on his face. Black-clad guards from the complex arrive, armed with machine guns and sporting similar V-shaped marks, and take Marsh away, knocking down Quatermass and ordering him to leave.|$|E
5|$|Early {{pressings}} of {{the sleeve}} {{were presented in}} a six-panel gatefold cover, with one side displaying the landscape in the daytime, whilst the other shows the same image at night, playing {{with the idea that}} during the day, the countryside is glorious and the city is dull and grey, whereas at nighttime the countryside is dark and the city is illuminated and alive. To prioritize the design, no text was included on the sleeve apart from a promotional sticker <b>shaped</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard plastic case with a protective cardboard sleeve.|$|E

5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was <b>shaped</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon, and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E
5|$|However, records {{do exist}} that refer to {{practices}} of nipple and genital piercing in various cultures {{prior to the}} 20th century. Kama Sutra, dated to the Gupta Empire of Ancient India, describes genital piercing to permit sexual enhancement by inserting pins and other objects into the foreskin of the penis. The Dayak tribesmen of Borneo passed a shard of bone through their glans for the opposite reason, to diminish their sexual activity. In the Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 64a), there may be mention of a genital piercing in the probition against the kumaz, which medieval French Talmudic commenter Rashi interpreted as a chastity piercing for women. Other interpreters have, however, suggested that the kumaz was rather a pendant <b>shaped</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> vulva or a girdle.|$|E
5|$|Many Japanese manga and anime {{have also}} adopted the western genre. Yasuhiro Nightow {{is known for}} {{creating}} the space western Trigun. The story's protagonist, Vash the Stampede, is a wandering gunslinger with a dark past. Unlike other violence-themed gunslingers, Vash carries a Shane-like pacifist attitude, and avoids killing men, even dangerous enemies. Behind him is the gun-toting priest named Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who carries with him a heavy machine gun and rocket launcher <b>shaped</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cross. Nicholas is more violent than Vash, and the two would often argue about killing opponents. Other western genre themed manga and anime include Cowboy Bebop and Kino's Journey, who both incorporate knight-errant gunslinger themes.|$|E
