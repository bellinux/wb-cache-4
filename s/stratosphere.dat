5|$|Neptune's spectra {{suggest that}} its lower <b>stratosphere</b> is hazy due to {{condensation}} of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane, such as ethane and ethyne. The <b>stratosphere</b> {{is also home}} to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. The <b>stratosphere</b> of Neptune is warmer than that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|The {{solution}} advocated is transporting sulfates {{into the}} next higher layer of the atmosphere - <b>stratosphere.</b> Aerosols in the <b>stratosphere</b> last years instead of weeks - so only a relatively smaller (though still large) amount of sulfate emissions would be necessary, and side effects would be less. This would require developing {{an efficient way to}} transport large amounts of gases into <b>stratosphere,</b> many of which have been proposed though none are known to be effective or economically viable.|$|E
5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the <b>stratosphere,</b> mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the <b>stratosphere</b> is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic {{observers}} {{found that}} ammonia and carbon disulfide persisted {{in the atmosphere}} for at least fourteen months after the collisions, with {{a considerable amount of}} ammonia being present in the <b>stratosphere</b> as opposed to its normal location in the troposphere.|$|E
5|$|Carbon-14 {{is formed}} in upper {{layers of the}} {{troposphere}} and the <b>stratosphere</b> at altitudes of 9–15km by a reaction that is precipitated by cosmic rays. Thermal neutrons are produced that collide with the nuclei of nitrogen-14, forming carbon-14 and a proton. As such, 1.2 × 1010% of atmospheric carbon dioxide contains carbon-14.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus Spissatus {{clouds are}} the highest clouds of the main cloud genera. They may form in the higher {{tropopause}} or even at the lower <b>stratosphere.</b> They are dense and opaque, not allowing {{the light of the}} sun or moon to pass through. They are more common on the anvils of cumulonimbus clouds.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientific}} {{studies suggest that}} ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the <b>stratosphere.</b> Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6°C in the local <b>stratosphere.</b> This cooling {{has the effect of}} intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} dust and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the <b>stratosphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|High-altitude clouds on Neptune {{have been}} {{observed}} casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitude. These circumferential bands have widths of 50–150km and lie about 50–110km above the cloud deck. These altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere. Weather does not occur in the higher <b>stratosphere</b> or thermosphere. Unlike Uranus, Neptune's composition has a higher volume of ocean, whereas Uranus has a smaller mantle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{cinematic}} of Iridion 3D Earth is attacked without warning by the Iridion, who take {{over much of}} the surface and lay mines in orbit and bombs in the Pacific Ocean. The player is the pilot of an experimental SHN fighter, the last hope for defending Earth from the Iridion. The player pilots his ship alone against hordes of Iridion fighters and natural obstacles. The early stages begin on Earth, with the player fighting through an Iridion garbage tunnel. The player proceeds to the Pacific Ocean and destroys much of the Iridion invasion fleet on Earth before heading into the <b>stratosphere</b> to destroy the orbital blockade around Earth and subsequently annihilating the Iridion boss at the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The Baker {{explosion}} ejected {{into the}} environment about twice as many free neutrons as there were fission events. A plutonium fission event produces, on average, 2.9 neutrons, {{most of which are}} consumed in the production of more fission, until fission falls off and the remaining uncaptured neutrons escape. In an air burst, most of these environmental neutrons are absorbed by superheated air which rises into the <b>stratosphere,</b> along with the fission products and unfissioned plutonium. In the underwater Baker detonation, the neutrons were captured by seawater in the lagoon.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU) {{maintains}} air {{and atmospheric}} measurement equipment at Troll. Combined {{with a similar}} measuring station, Zeppelin in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, Norway. This allows the institute to collect such data from both polar regions. In particular, the facility measures aerosols, organic and inorganic pollution, ozone and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. NILU also creates air samples annually to generate data for trend analysis. The weekly air pollution measurements are compared to equivalent measurements at Zeppelin. Ground measurements are taken of ozone and mercury, two of the greatest pollution threats in the polar regions. <b>Stratosphere</b> measurements are conducted to measure ozone and UV levels, in particular to gain additional information about ozone depletion and the Antarctic ozone hole.|$|E
5|$|The {{unpressurized}} rotodome is 30feet (9.1m) in diameter, {{six feet}} (1.8m) thick at the center, and is held 11feet (3.4m) above the fuselage by two struts. It is tilted {{down at the}} front to reduce its aerodynamic drag, which lessens its detrimental effect on take-offs and endurance (which is corrected electronically by both the radar and secondary surveillance radar antenna phase shifters). The rotodome uses bleed air, outside cooling doors, and fluorocarbon based cold plate cooling to maintain the electronic and mechanical equipment temperatures. The hydraulically rotated antenna system permits the Westinghouse Corporation's AN/APY-1 and AN/APY-2 passive electronically scanned array radar system to provide surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the <b>stratosphere,</b> over land or water.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{hypothesized}} fire and/or nuclear winter effects, the impact would have inhibited photosynthesis {{by creating a}} dust cloud that blocked sunlight {{for up to a}} year. Further, the asteroid struck a region of sulfur-rich carbonate rock, much of which was vaporized, thereby injecting sulfuric acid aerosols into the <b>stratosphere,</b> which might have reduced sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by more than 50%, and would have caused rain and ocean water to become acidic. The acidification of the oceans would kill many organisms that build shells from calcium carbonate. At Brazos section, the paleo-sea surface temperature dropped as much as 7℃ for decades after the impact. It would take at least ten years for such aerosols to dissipate, and would account for the extinction of plants and phytoplankton, and of organisms dependent on them (including predatory animals as well as herbivores). Some creatures whose food chains were based on detritus would have a reasonable chance of survival, however.|$|E
5|$|Carbon-14 (C) is a {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope, {{created in the}} upper atmosphere (lower <b>stratosphere</b> and upper troposphere) by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays. It is found in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%), mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits, particularly of peat and other organic materials. This isotope decays by 0.158MeV β emission. Because of its relatively short half-life of 5730years, C is virtually absent in ancient rocks. The amount of C in the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in radiocarbon dating, invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000years.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 until mid-1947, the Piccards were {{consultants}} to General Mills (the cereal company and dominant industry in Minneapolis) working under Otto Winzen, who Jean had met through the university. Winzen and Jean proposed a <b>stratosphere</b> flight with 100 cluster balloons and secured a government {{contract with the}} Navy. Featured in Navy press releases, Jean was named a project scientist responsible for gondola design and for testing the balloon film materials. But he balked, both at making weekly status reports that made him feel like a lower-level employee, and {{at the prospect of}} General Mills owning the patents to his ideas. Working as a consultant, Jeannette threatened to break off ties with the Navy and General Mills unless she was allowed to fly with Jean. Unfortunately this began a rift between General Mills and the Piccards. They were both were fired in 1947, for they were too critical of Winzen and General Mills staff.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic gas {{includes}} {{a variety of}} substances. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissociated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution downwind from the volcano. Globally, large explosive eruptions that inject a tremendous volume of sulfur aerosols into the <b>stratosphere</b> can lead to lower surface temperatures and promote weakening of the Earth's ozone layer. Because carbon dioxide gas is heavier than air, the gas may flow into low-lying areas and collect in the soil. The concentration of carbon dioxide gas in these areas can be lethal to people, animals, and vegetation.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{numerical}} weather prediction is to sample {{the state of the}} fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future. The main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated weather stations at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea. The World Meteorological Organization acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide. Stations either report hourly in METAR reports, or every six hours in SYNOP reports. Sites launch radiosondes, which rise through the depth of the troposphere and well into the <b>stratosphere.</b> Data from weather satellites are used in areas where traditional data sources are not available. Compared with similar data from radiosondes, the satellite data has the advantage of global coverage, however at a lower accuracy and resolution. Meteorological radar provide information on precipitation location and intensity, which can be used to estimate precipitation accumulations over time. Additionally, if a pulse Doppler weather radar is used then wind speed and direction can be determined.|$|E
25|$|The {{ozone layer}} is {{contained}} within the <b>stratosphere.</b> It is mainly located in the lower portion of the <b>stratosphere</b> from about , though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the <b>stratosphere.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the ozone}} that is {{destroyed}} is in the lower <b>stratosphere,</b> {{in contrast to the}} much smaller ozone depletion through homogeneous gas phase reactions, which occurs primarily in the upper <b>stratosphere.</b>|$|E
25|$|Models and {{observations}} (see figure above, middle) show that greenhouse gas results in warming {{of the lower}} atmosphere at the surface (called the troposphere) but cooling of the upper atmosphere (called the <b>stratosphere).</b> Depletion {{of the ozone layer}} by chemical refrigerants has also resulted in a cooling effect in the <b>stratosphere.</b> If the sun was responsible for observed warming, warming of the troposphere at the surface and warming {{at the top of the}} <b>stratosphere</b> would be expected as increase solar activity would replenish ozone and oxides of nitrogen. The <b>stratosphere</b> has a reverse temperature gradient than the troposphere so as the temperature of the troposphere cools with altitude, the <b>stratosphere</b> rises with altitude. Hadley cells are the mechanism by which equatorial generated ozone in the tropics (highest area of UV irradiance in the <b>stratosphere)</b> is moved poleward. Global climate models suggest that climate change may widen the Hadley cells and push the jetstream northward thereby expanding the tropics region and resulting in warmer, dryer conditions in those areas overall.|$|E
25|$|Las Vegas Boulevard {{divides the}} east–west streets from the Las Vegas Strip to near the <b>Stratosphere,</b> then Main Street becomes the {{dividing}} line from the <b>Stratosphere</b> to the North Las Vegas border, after which the Goldfield Street alignment divides east and west.|$|E
25|$|The <b>stratosphere</b> is {{the middle}} layer of the Uranian atmosphere, in which {{temperature}} generally increases with altitude from 53K in the tropopause to between 800 and 850K at the base thermosphere. The heating of the <b>stratosphere</b> {{is caused by the}} downward heat conduction from the hot thermosphere as well as by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and the complex hydrocarbons formed as a result of methane photolysis. The methane enters the <b>stratosphere</b> through the cold tropopause, where its mixing ratio relative to molecular hydrogen is about 3, three times below saturation. It decreases further to about 10−7 at the altitude corresponding to pressure of 0.1mbar.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to hydrocarbons, the <b>stratosphere</b> contains carbon monoxide, {{as well as}} traces of water vapor and carbon dioxide. The mixing ratio of carbon monoxide—3—is {{very similar to that}} of the hydrocarbons, while the mixing ratios of carbon dioxide and water are about 10−11 and 8, respectively. These three compounds are distributed relatively homogeneously in the <b>stratosphere</b> and are not confined to a narrow layer like hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|The {{total amount}} of ozone in the <b>stratosphere</b> is {{determined}} by a balance between photochemical production and recombination.|$|E
25|$|Ethane, {{acetylene}} and diacetylene condense in the colder {{lower part}} of <b>stratosphere</b> forming haze layers with an optical depth of about 0.01 in visible light. Condensation occurs at approximately 14, 2.5 and 0.1mbar for ethane, acetylene and diacetylene, respectively. The concentration of hydrocarbons in the Uranian <b>stratosphere</b> is significantly lower than in the stratospheres of the other giant planets—the upper atmosphere of Uranus is very clean and transparent above the haze layers. This depletion is caused by weak vertical mixing, and makes Uranus's <b>stratosphere</b> less opaque and, as a result, colder than those of other giant planets. The hazes, like their parent hydrocarbons, are distributed unevenly across Uranus; at the solstice of 1986, when Voyager 2 passed by the planet, they were concentrated near the sunlit pole, making it dark in ultraviolet light.|$|E
25|$|The Piccards {{retained}} Century of Progress; while piloting the airship in October 1934, Jeannette Piccard {{became the}} first woman to reach the <b>stratosphere.</b>|$|E
25|$|Polar stratospheric clouds form in {{the lowest}} part of the <b>stratosphere</b> during the winter, at the {{altitude}} and during the season that produces the coldest temperatures and therefore the best chances of triggering condensation caused by adiabatic cooling. They are typically very thin with an undulating cirriform appearance. Moisture is scarce in the <b>stratosphere,</b> so nacreous and non-nacreous cloud at this altitude range is rare and is usually restricted to polar regions in the winter where the air is coldest.|$|E
25|$|Project Loon is Google's pursuit {{to deploy}} a high-altitude balloon network {{operating}} in the <b>stratosphere,</b> at altitudes between 18km and 25km. Google asserts that this particular layer of the <b>stratosphere</b> is advantageous because of its relatively low wind speeds (e.g., wind speeds between 5 and 20mph / 10 to 30 km/h) and minimal turbulence. Moreover, Google claims that it can model, with reasonable accuracy, the seasonal, longitudinal, and latitudinal variations in wind speeds within the 18–25km stratospheric layer.|$|E
25|$|Very violent {{volcanic}} eruptions can inject HCl into the <b>stratosphere,</b> but researchers {{have shown that}} the contribution is not significant compared to that from CFCs.|$|E
25|$|During periods lacking {{volcanic}} activity (and thus direct injection of SO2 into the <b>stratosphere),</b> oxidation of COS (carbonyl sulfide) dominates {{the production of}} stratospheric sulfur aerosol.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the latest}} {{study showed that}} the role of Mount Erebus volcano in the Antarctic ozone {{depletion}} was probably underestimated. Based on the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data over the last 35 years and by using the NOAA HYSPLIT trajectory model, researchers showed that Erebus volcano gas emissions (including hydrogen chloride (HCl)) can reach the Antarctic <b>stratosphere</b> via high-latitude cyclones and then the polar vortex. Depending on Erebus volcano activity, the additional annual HCl mass entering the <b>stratosphere</b> from Erebus varies from 1.0 to 14.3 kt.|$|E
25|$|The {{homosphere}} and heterosphere: The homosphere {{includes the}} troposphere, <b>stratosphere,</b> and mesosphere. The {{upper part of}} the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.|$|E
25|$|These eruptions {{had built}} up a {{substantial}} amount of atmospheric dust. As is common after a massive volcanic eruption, temperatures fell worldwide because less sunlight passed through the <b>stratosphere.</b>|$|E
25|$|Explorer II {{included}} communications equipment, {{and constant}} radio contact was maintained throughout the flight with the signal being broadcast across the U.S. and in Europe. The onboard instruments collected data on cosmic rays, the ozone distribution and electrical conductivity {{of the atmosphere}} at different altitudes, the atmospheric composition of the <b>stratosphere,</b> and the luminosity of the Sun, Moon and Earth. In addition, microorganisms were collected from the <b>stratosphere.</b> Mold samples were carried along {{to determine the effects}} of cosmic ray exposure. Stevens took along a camera to take pictures, including the first ever motion pictures shot from the <b>stratosphere.</b> The collected data showed that the ozone in the upper atmosphere was effective at blocking most of the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. It was also found that the percentage of oxygen at the peak altitude was about the same as that at sea level.|$|E
25|$|If stratospheric {{conditions}} {{become more}} severe (cooler temperatures, more clouds, more active chlorine), global ozone may decrease at a greater pace. Standard global warming theory {{predicts that the}} <b>stratosphere</b> will cool.|$|E
