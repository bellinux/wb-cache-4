40|$|Polystyrene latex {{particles}} coated with crosslinked poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) Abstract Thermoresponsive colloi-dal particles were prepared by seeded precipitation polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) {{in the presence}} of a crosslinking mono-mer, N,N-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA), using polystyrene latex parti-cles (ca. 50 nm in diameter) as seeds in aqueous dispersion. Phase transitions of the prepared poly(N-isopropyla-crylamide), PNIPAM, shells on polystyrene cores were studied in comparison to colloidal PNIPAM microgel particles, in H 2 O and/or in D 2 O by dynamic light scattering, microcalorimetry and by 1 H NMR spectroscopy including the measure-ments of spin–lattice (T 1) and spin– spin (T 2) relaxation times for the protons of PNIPAM. As expected, the seed particles grew in hydrodynamic size during the crosslinking polymer-ization of NIPAM, and a larger NIPAM to seed mass ratio in the polymerization batch led to a larger increase of particle size indicating a product coated with a thicker PNIPAM <b>shell.</b> <b>Broader</b> microcalori-metric endotherms of dehydration were observed for crosslinked PNIPAM on the solid cores compared to the PNIPAM microgels and also an increase of the transition temperature was observed. The calorimetric results were complemented by the NMR spectroscopy data of the 1 H-signal intensities upon heating in D 2 O, showing that the phase transition of crosslinked PNIPAM on polystyrene core shifts towards higher tempera-tures when compared to the microgels, and also that the temperature range of the transition is broader...|$|R
50|$|Liparoceras is an extinct fossil ammonite {{species from}} the Early Jurassic period of England, and {{is found in}} lower Lias deposits.

50|$|The small, white {{shell is}} oval and depressed. It is very thin. It grows to {{a length of}} 5½ mm. The <b>shell</b> is <b>broader</b> towards the front, the ends are {{slightly}} raised. The front and side-slopes are slightly convex. The posterior slope is nearly straight, with a very small impression below the nucleus,This nucleus is smooth, compressed, subspiral, placed at {{a little more than}} 6/11 of the total length of the shell. The sculpture consists of a few concentric striae. Moreover, the whole surface is covered by very small, crowded granulesof an irregular oval, potatolike shape. Sometimes two or three granules are confluent. They are placed in oblique rows. The inside of the shell is smooth.|$|R
5000|$|... (Original description) The <b>shell</b> is <b>broad</b> above, the {{diameter}} {{about two-thirds of}} the length; The spire is low, its outline strongly concave, rising to an acute apex. The periphery is carinate, the slopes below it nearly straight. The early whorls have a smooth keel, projecting above the suture; but the last five are flat, with very weak traces of spiral striae, and are separated by a plain, narrowly impressed suture. The last whorl has coarse, well separated spiral cords on the anterior end, but under suitably oblique light very faint spirals lay be seen throughout. The faint growth striae retract rather strongly near the shoulder. The aperture is very narrow. The size of the shell varies between 27 mm and 29 mm.|$|R
50|$|The 2004 shell {{incorporates}} the prominent front arch of the 1926 <b>shell,</b> the <b>broad</b> {{profile of the}} 1928 shell, and the unadorned white finish (and most of the general lines) of the 1929 shell. In addition, the ring-shaped structure hung within the shell, supporting lights and acoustic clouds, echoes a somewhat similar structure hung within the 1927 shell. During the 2004 season, because the back wall was not yet finished, a white curtain was hung at the back; beginning with the 2005 season, the curtain was removed to reveal a finished back wall. The architectural design for the shell {{was developed by the}} Los Angeles-based architectural practice Hodgetts and Fung, with the structural concept developed by the local office of Arup.|$|R
