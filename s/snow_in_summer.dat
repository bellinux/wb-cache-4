60|$|The {{bands of}} the guerilla chiefs {{differed}} greatly in strength, varying from merely ten or {{a dozen men}} {{to three or four}} thousand, and indeed each band varied continually.

The bands, too, would vary in proportion to the renown of their chiefs.

I have come across bones {{once or twice}} lying {{scattered}} about in snug-looking valleys--bones of horses and men, and {{it was easy to}} see they had been killed by a snow-slide coming down on them. Rocks were heaped about among them, some of the bones were smashed. They had been hunting or trapping, and sheltered up in a valley when the storm came on and the slide had fallen on them, and there they had laid till the sun melted the <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> <b>summer,</b> when the coyotes and the vultures would soon clean the bones."

60|$|In {{the arctic}} regions {{there are a}} number of animals which are wholly white all the year round, or which only turn white in winter. Among the former are the polar bear and the American polar hare, the snowy owl and the Greenland falcon; among the latter the arctic fox, the arctic hare, the ermine, and the ptarmigan. Those which are {{permanently}} white remain among the snow nearly all the year round, while those which change their colour inhabit regions which are free from <b>snow</b> <b>in</b> <b>summer.</b> The obvious explanation of this style of coloration is, that it is protective, serving to conceal the herbivorous species from their enemies, and enabling carnivorous animals to approach their prey unperceived. Two other explanations have, however, been suggested. One is, that the prevalent white of the arctic regions has a direct effect in producing the white colour in animals, either by some photographic or chemical action on the skin or by a reflex action through vision. The other is, that the white colour is chiefly beneficial as a means of checking radiation and so preserving animal heat during the severity of an arctic winter. The first is part of the general theory that colour is the effect of coloured light on the objects--a pure hypothesis which has, I believe, no facts whatever to support it. The second suggestion is also an hypothesis merely, since it has not been proved by experiment that a white colour, per se, independently of the fur or feathers which is so coloured, has any effect whatever in checking the radiation of low-grade heat like that of the animal body. But both alike are sufficiently disproved by the interesting exceptions to the rule of white coloration in the arctic regions, which exceptions are, nevertheless, quite in harmony with the theory of protection.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is a design of a public library in the {{historical}} {{part of the city}} of Přerov. The locality that’s beeing solved, so called Na Marku, is situated {{at the point where the}} three important pedestrian routes meet on the bank of the Bečva river. Attractivness of the place is well increased by the nearness of both the main squares, the river and the unique well-preserved underpass used in the past by the brewery. Every landscape, every city and place have their own memory. The locality „Na Marku“ is packed with memories that run back to the first settlements on the river bank, the construction of the city walls, and up to the recent reconstruction of the Tyrš bridge. Throughout the history the place was formed by the local inhabitans and their varoius activities. Those gave origin to historical and spatial layers that overlay and complement each other and have – in Přerov, as well as anywhere in the world – a huge influence on one’s identification with a familiar place. This is where the church used to be. This is the path that leads down to the river.

60|$|A third {{hypothesis}} was, {{that the}} rising {{of the water}} was occasioned by the melting of the <b>snows</b> <b>in</b> <b>summer</b> on the mountains from which {{the sources of the}} river came. Against this supposition Herodotus found more numerous and more satisfactory reasons even than he had advanced against the others. In the first place the river came from the south--a direction in which the heat increased in intensity with every league, as far as travelers had explored it; and beyond those limits, they supposed that the burning sun made the country uninhabitable. It was preposterous to suppose that there could be snow and ice there. Then, besides, the Nile had been ascended to a great distance, and reports from the natives had been brought down from regions still more remote, and no tidings had ever been brought of ice and snow. It was unreasonable, therefore, to suppose that the inundations could arise from such a cause.|$|R
