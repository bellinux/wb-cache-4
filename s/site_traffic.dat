25|$|Rex Sorgatz, {{designer}} of Mediaite and CMO of Vyou, issued a {{bet that the}} redesigns would fail to bring in traffic, and Nick Denton took him up on it. The measure {{was the number of}} page views by October recorded on Quantcast. Page views after the redesign declined significantly—Gawker's sites had an 80% decrease in overall traffic immediately after the change and a 50% decrease over two weeks—with many users either leaving the site or viewing international versions of the site, which hadn't switched to the new layout. On 28 February 2011, faced with declining traffic, Gawker sites allowed for visitors to choose between the new design and the old design for viewing the sites. Sorgatz was eventually determined to be the winner of the bet, as at the end of September, 2011, Gawker had only 500 million monthly views, not the 510 million it had had prior to the redesign. However, on 5 October 2011, <b>site</b> <b>traffic</b> returned to its pre-redesign numbers, and as of February 2012, <b>site</b> <b>traffic</b> had increased by 10 million over the previous year, according to Quantcast.

It was the first board created, and is by far 4chan's most popular board, with 30% of <b>site</b> <b>traffic.</b> Gawker.com's Nick Douglas {{summarized}} /b/ as a board where [...] "people try to shock, entertain, and coax free porn from each other." [...] /b/ has a [...] "no rules" [...] policy, except for bans on certain illegal content, such as child pornography, invasions of other websites (posting floods of disruptive content), and under-18 viewing, {{all of which are}} inherited from site-wide rules. The [...] "no invasions" [...] rule was added in late 2006, after /b/ users spent most of the summer [...] "invading" [...] Habbo Hotel. The [...] "no rules" [...] policy also applies to actions of administrators and moderators, which means that users may be banned at any time, for any reason, including no reason at all. Due partially to its anonymous nature, board moderation is not always successful—indeed, the site's anti-child pornography rule is a subject of jokes on /b/.
