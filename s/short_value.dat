After portfolio formation, the difference in economic fundamentals between the high and low price-to-book portfolios decreases significantly, which indicates that investors might be extrapolating past economic trends too far into the future. ...|$|E

Using a Sigma- beam of 340 GeV/c we have obtained clean signals for the Omega_c decaying into Xi- K- pi+ pi+ and Omega- pi+ pi- pi+, avoiding topological cuts normally used in charm analysis. The short but measurable lifetime of the Omega_c is demonstrated by a clear enhancement of the signals at short but finite decay lengths. Using a continuous maximum likelihood method we determined the lifetime to be tau(Omega_c) = 55 + 13 - 11 (stat) + 18 - 23 (syst) fs. This makes the Omega_c the shortest living weakly decaying particle observed so far.

In this paper we use information on institutional mutual funds to examine the implications of active positions and style tilts taken by management for the fund’s realised alpha, tracking error and information ratio. We identify some areas where the funds across the entire sample have success (active positions, and growth and winning stock tilts) and others where they fall <b>short</b> (<b>value</b> and loser stock tilts). We identify that there is significant variation in these findings when we extend our analysis to examine the impact of these active decisions on performance for different styles of funds during periods of weak and strong markets. Finally, we repeat the analysis by incorporating the initial choice of investment style with the active decisions in order to judge their dual impact on investment performance...|$|E
40|$|A {{cryptographic}} accumulator is {{a scheme}} where {{a set of}} elements is represented by a single <b>short</b> <b>value.</b> This value, along with another value called witness allows to prove membership into the set. In their survey on accumulators [FN 02], Fazzio and Nicolisi noted that the Camenisch and Lysyanskaya’s construction[CL 02] was such that the time to update a witness after m changes to the accumulated value was proportional to m. They posed the question whether batch update was possible, namely if {{it was possible to}} build a cryptographic accumulator where the time to update witnesses is independent from the number of changes in the accumulated set. Recently, Wang et al. answered positively by giving a construction for an accumulator with batch update in [WWP 07, WWP 08]. In this work we show that the construction is not secure by exhibiting an attack. Moreover, we prove it cannot be fixed. If the accumulated value has been updated m times, then the time to update a witness must be at least Ω(m) in the worst case. ...|$|E
