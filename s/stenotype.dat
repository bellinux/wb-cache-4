25|$|Machine {{shorthand}} is also {{a common}} term for writing produced by a <b>stenotype,</b> a specialized keyboard. These are often used for court room transcripts and in live subtitling. However, there are other shorthand machines used worldwide, including: Velotype; Palantype in the UK; Grandjean <b>Stenotype,</b> used extensively in France and French-speaking countries; Michela <b>Stenotype,</b> used extensively in Italy; and Stenokey, used in Bulgaria and elsewhere.

25|$|Chorded keyboards, {{such as the}} <b>Stenotype</b> and Velotype, allow {{letters and}} words to be entered using {{combinations}} of keys in a single stroke. Users of <b>stenotype</b> machines can often reach rates as high as 300 words per minute and these systems are commonly used for real-time transcription by court reporters and in live closed captioning systems.|$|E
25|$|Communication Access Real-Time Translation (CART) stenographers, who use a {{computer}} with using either <b>stenotype</b> or Velotype keyboards to transcribe stenographic input for presentation as captions within 2–3 seconds of the representing audio, must caption anything which is purely live and unscripted; however, the most recent developments include operators using speech recognition software and revoicing the dialog. Speech recognition technology has advanced so quickly in the United States that about 50% of all live captioning is through speech recognition as of 2005. Real-time captions look different from offline captions, as they are presented as a continuous flow of text as people speak.|$|E
25|$|While other {{keyboards}} generally associate one {{action with}} each key, chorded keyboards associate actions with combinations of key presses. Since {{there are many}} combinations available, chorded keyboards can effectively produce more actions on a board with fewer keys. Court reporters' <b>stenotype</b> machines use chorded keyboards {{to enable them to}} enter text much faster by typing a syllable with each stroke instead of one letter at a time. The fastest typists (as of 2007) use a stenograph, a kind of chorded keyboard used by most court reporters and closed-caption reporters. Some chorded keyboards are also made for use in situations where fewer keys are preferable, such as on devices that can be used with only one hand, and on small mobile devices that don't have room for larger keyboards. Chorded keyboards are less desirable in many cases because it usually takes practice and memorization of the combinations to become proficient.|$|E
2500|$|For live programs, spoken words {{comprising}} the television program's soundtrack are transcribed by a human operator (a speech-to-text reporter) using <b>stenotype</b> or stenomask type of machines, whose phonetic output is instantly translated into text {{by a computer}} and displayed on the screen. This technique {{was developed in the}} 1970s as an initiative of the BBC's Ceefax teletext service. In collaboration with the BBC, a university student took on the research project of writing the first phonetics-to-text conversion program for this purpose. Sometimes, the captions of live broadcasts, like news bulletins, sports events, live entertainment shows, and other live shows, fall behind by a few seconds. This delay is because the machine does not know what the person is going to say next, so after the person on the show says the sentence, the captions appear. Automatic computer speech recognition now works well when trained to recognize a single voice, and so since 2003, the BBC does live subtitling by having someone re-speak what is being broadcast. Live captioning is also a form of real-time text. Meanwhile, sport events on channels like ESPN are using court reporters, using a special (steno) keyboard and individually constructed [...] "dictionaries." ...|$|E

50|$|Some {{people have}} {{compared}} Dvorak and QWERTY to other keyboard input systems, namely <b>stenotype</b> and its implementations (e.g., opensource PLOVER http://plover.stenoknight.com/). These systems provide some advantage (including a 700% increase in efficiency over QWERTY) {{but they are}} fundamentally different from ordinary typing. Words are input by pressing on several keys and releasing simultaneously but don't require the keys to be pressed down in any order. Neither is the spacebar used. There is a learning hurdle in that hunt and peck does not work. However, {{it is easy to}} write at 180-300 wpm. It is worth noting that PLOVER <b>stenotype</b> theory required a <b>stenotype</b> machine prior to 2010; due to the inherent difficulties of chording QWERTY was invented to allow machines to be made that didn't jam up; <b>stenotype</b> was invented for maximum speed and accuracy.|$|E
5000|$|Steno {{paper has}} become almost {{obsolete}} with the advancement in paperless <b>stenotype</b> machines.

50|$|Stenographic {{keyboards}} {{are generally}} more difficult to learn than the Veyboard, but trained <b>stenotype</b> operators can go faster, even upwards of 300 words per minute. However, if unusual words appear, a typist using a <b>stenotype</b> slows down, while the Velotypist can continue with the same speed, which can go up to 200 words per minute.|$|E

50|$|The first {{widespread}} use of a chord keyboard was in the <b>stenotype</b> machine used by court reporters, which was invented in 1868 and is still in use. The output of the <b>stenotype</b> was originally a phonetic code {{that had to be}} transcribed later (usually by the same operator who produced the original output), rather than arbitrary text—automatic conversion software is now commonplace.|$|E
50|$|Thad Starner from Georgia Institute of Technology {{and others}} {{published}} numerous {{studies showing that}} two handed chorded text entry was faster and yielded fewer errors than on a QWERTY keyboard. Currently <b>stenotype</b> machines hold the record for fastest word entry. Many <b>stenotype</b> users can reach 300 words per minute. However, stenographers typically train for three years before reaching professional levels of speed and accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Most modern <b>stenotype</b> {{keyboards}} {{have more}} in common with computers than they do with typewriters or QWERTY computer keyboards. Most contain microprocessors, and many allow sensitivity adjustments for each individual key. They translate <b>stenotype</b> to English internally using user-specific dictionaries, and most have small display screens. They typically store a full day's work in non-volatile memory of some type, such as an SD Card. These factors influence the price, along with economies of scale, as there are only a few thousand <b>stenotype</b> keyboards sold each year. , student models, such as a Wave writer, sell for about US$1,500 and top-end models sell for approximately US$5,000. Machines that are 10 to 15 years old still resell for upwards of $350.|$|E

50|$|A <b>stenotype,</b> <b>stenotype</b> machine, {{shorthand}} {{machine or}} steno writer is a specialized chorded keyboard or typewriter used by stenographers for shorthand use. In order {{to pass the}} United States Registered Professional Reporter test, a trained court reporter or closed captioner must write speeds of approximately 180, 200, and 225 words per minute (wpm) at very high accuracy in the categories of literary, jury charge, and testimony, respectively. Some stenographers can reach 300 words per minute. The Web site of the California Official Court Reporters Association gives the official record for American English as 375 wpm.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stenotype</b> {{keyboards}} {{enable the}} trained user to input text {{as fast as}} 225 wpm or faster at very high accuracy {{for an extended period}} of time, which is sufficient for real-time activities such as court reporting or closed captioning. While dropout rates are very high—in some cases, only 10% or even less graduate—stenotype students are usually able to reach speeds of 100-120 wpm within six months, which is faster than most alphanumeric typists. Guinness World Records gives 360 wpm with 97.23% accuracy as the highest achieved speed using a <b>stenotype.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{keyboard}} is an orthographic chord keyboard, {{very different}} from phonetic chord keyboards used for verbatim transcription, like the <b>stenotype.</b> Such chorded phonetic keyboards, such as those manufactured by Stenograph, produce an intermediate shorthand format in which a combination of phonetics- and spelling-based strokes are translated by software to produce the output. Orthographic keyboards, on the other hand, allow the operator to rely on more traditional spelling in shaping the output, hence the term [...] "orthographic" [...] as opposed to [...] "phonetic".|$|E
