500|$|Caught up in {{the wave}} {{of rock and roll}} {{sweeping}} across Italy in 1958, Mina listened to American records and was a frequent visitor at the , the Santa Tecla, and the Taverna Messicana clubs of Milan, which promoted rock and roll music. Mina's repertoire at the beginning of her career included clumsy imitations of British and American rock and jazz songs, while her extra-loud and syncopated version of the song [...] "Nessuno" [...] showcased her excellent sense of rhythm.

She stood near it for weeks, defending it by <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and hissing at anyone who approached; this behavior demonstrated that Cuban iguanas guard their nest sites. The hatchlings spend several days to two weeks in the nest chamber from the time they hatch to the time they emerge from the nests; dispersing individually after emergence.|$|E
