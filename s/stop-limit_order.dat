A <b>stop-limit</b> <b>order</b> is an order {{to buy or sell}} a stock that {{combines the}} features of a stop order and a limit order. Once the stop price is reached, a <b>stop-limit</b> <b>order</b> becomes a limit order that will be executed at a specified price (or better). As with all limit orders, a <b>stop-limit</b> <b>order</b> doesn't get filled if the security's price never reaches the specified limit price.|$|E

The exact mechanism of a stop order may vary between brokers and software platforms. For instance, Charles Schwab defines a stop order as follows:Stop <b>orders</b> and <b>stop-limit</b> <b>orders</b> are very similar, the primary difference being what happens once the stop price is triggered. A standard sell-stop order is triggered when the bid price is equal to or less than the stop price specified or when an execution occurs at the stop price.|$|R
