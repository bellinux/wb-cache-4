25|$|Though {{extraversion}} and neuroticism seem to {{have the}} largest effect on personal happiness, other Big 5 personality factors have also been shown to correlate with happiness and subjective well-being.

While the effect of these traits was not as strong as extraversion or neuroticism, it is clear that they <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> impact on happiness outcomes.|$|E
25|$|This is {{important}} because enzymes do not have perfect discrimination; a nuclease will <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> likelihood of acting even if the sequence does not match perfectly.

Exclusion of these sequences, which are very similar but not identical, is still an important problem to be overcome in genome engineering.|$|E

25|$|In the {{architecture}} of Cistercian churches the transept is usually quite wide and the lateral aisles are covered with groined vaults that help to sustain the longitudinal central nave. There is a clear preference for square-shaped apses, more simple and economical to build. The columns and piers supporting pointed-arched arcades (already a proto-Gothic feature), have big strong capitals and stand on rectangular blocks on the ground floor. Although Tarouca Abbey was clearly inspired in the Burgundian abbeys of Clairvaux and Fontenay and Salzedas <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> similarities with Fontfroide, their authentic and magnificent Cistercian architectural features are mixed with local Portuguese decorative motifs.|$|E
25|$|Philadelphia once {{comprised}} six congressional districts. However, as {{a result}} of the city's declining population, it now has only three: the 1st district, represented by Bob Brady; the 2nd, represented by Dwight Evans; and the 13th, represented by Brendan Boyle. All three are Democrats. Although they are usually swamped by Democrats in city, state and national elections, Republicans <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> support in the area, primarily in the northeast. A Republican represented a significant portion of Philadelphia in the House as late as 1983, and Sam Katz ran competitive mayoral races as the Republican nominee in both 1999 and 2003.|$|E
25|$|Banknotes have {{a natural}} {{advantage}} over coins {{in that they are}} lighter to carry but are also less durable. Banknotes issued by commercial banks had counterparty risk, meaning that the bank {{may not be able to}} make payment when the note was presented. Notes issued by central banks had a theoretical risk when they were backed by gold and silver. Both banknotes and coins are subject to inflation. The durability of coins means that even if metal coins melt in a fire or are submerged under the sea for hundreds of years they <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> value when they are recovered. Gold coins salvaged from shipwrecks retain almost all of their original appearance, but silver coins slowly corrode.|$|E

25|$|After France {{surrendered}} on 22 June, the regiment's survivors {{were brought}} together at Auch in Gers department in August 1940, {{by the army}} of the Vichy government then ruling southern France. The men were formed into two horse-mounted squadrons, three squadrons of cyclists, an armoured car squadron, a signals platoon, and a fanfare. Much of their heavier weaponry was well-camouflaged, and hidden whenever Vichy officials or German officers were in the area, as it was officially forbidden for the Vichy military. Their commander, Colonel Guy Schlesser, was determined they would <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> role to play in defending France. By his speeches and pamphlets, and his encouragement of skiing (at a dedicated chalet near Campan) and a wide range of sports and other recreation, he kept morale high. Generals sent to inspect the regiment expressed their admiration at its high level of organisation.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to spiders, silkworms are {{another source of}} silk. Protein from Bombyx mori silkworms is a core of fibroin protein surrounded by sericin, which is a family of glue-like proteins. Fibroin has been characterized as a heavy chain with a repeated hydrophobic and crystallizable sequence: Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Gly-X (X stands for Ser or Tyr). The surrounding sericin is more hydrophilic due to many polar residues, but it does <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> hydrophobic β-sheet portions. Silks have been long been used as sutures due to their high mechanical strength and flexibility as well as permeability to water and oxygen. In addition, silk fibroin can be easily manipulated and sterilized. However, silk use halted when undesirable immunological reactions were reported. Recently, it has been discovered {{that the cause of}} the immunological problems lies solely with the surrounding sericin. Since this discovery, silk with the sericin removed has been used in many pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Because it is necessary to remove the sericin from around the fibroin before the silk can be used, an efficient procedure needs to be developed for its removal, which is known as degumming. One degrumming method uses boiling aqueous Na2CO3 solution, which removes the sericin without damaging the fibroin. Yang, Chen et al. demonstrated that the silk fibroin and silk fibroin extract fluid show good biocompatibility with Schwann cells, with no cytotoxic effects on proliferation.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{was happy}} to have an episode of his own, but was puzzled {{at some of the}} contradictions in the script, such as having him assassinate John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> hope {{in the back of your}} mind that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity.

Luna, Jansen, Whitehead, and Birdsell reprise their roles from {{earlier in the}} series. When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are [...] "still in our world, so we <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> of {{these people in the}} mix ... but right now we’re on the Ghost Rider kick." [...] On having Johnson and Reyes join up with S.H.I.E.L.D., Whedon called it uneasy [...] "for everyone involved. Daisy has {{made it very clear that}} she doesn’t want to be with our team. There’s all that history and pain there. For Robbie, this is a guy who has never had a team, and probably doesn’t function well within one. We’ll see pretty quickly that it’s an uneasy alliance and it’s going to cause a lot of drama." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs from}} the band's third album, Vitalogy, were premiered during this tour.

At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't {{think any of us}} would be in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the day that we found out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know if we should play, or if we should just go home, or if we should attend the services. I <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> regrets about that, even though {{in the end it was}} probably better that we played the last two weeks of the tour.

Describing the album as a [...] "masterclass in what happens when a great band comes together", Yahoo! Music's Hattie Collins wrote, [...] "Despite the low-points, this is a Destiny's Child must have collection of classics from one of R's most significant talents". A more mixed review came from Fiona Mckinlay from the website musicOMH who felt the album included many [...] "skippable" [...] songs and noted that the material from The Writing's on the Wall and Survivor were the collection's best. She {{felt that the}} progress in the sound of the band was evident on #1's, but offered the opinion, [...] "As far as greatest hits albums go, Destiny's Child show themselves to be pretty ace, but still not quite the incredible force in R". San Francisco Chronicle Aidin Vaziri criticized the songs from Destiny Fulfilled and [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] and concluded [...] "surveying Destiny's Child's entire career on this set... it's obvious their hearts slipped away around the same time Beyonce's solo album sold its first million".|$|E
500|$|What {{became known}} as the [...] "Norway debate" [...] opened on 7 May, and lasted for two days. The initial speeches, {{including}} Chamberlain's, were nondescript, but Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes, member for Portsmouth North, in full uniform, delivered a withering attack on the conduct of the Norway campaign, though he excluded Churchill from criticism. Leo Amery then delivered a speech which he concluded by echoing Oliver Cromwell's words on dissolving the Long Parliament: [...] "You have sat here too long for any good you are doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!" [...] When Labour announced that they would call for a division of the House of Commons, Chamberlain called upon his [...] "friends—and I <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> friends in this House—to support the Government tonight". Though {{the use of the word}} [...] "friends" [...] was a conventional term to refer to party colleagues, and, according to biographer Robert Self, many MPs took it that way, it was an [...] "error of judgment" [...] for Chamberlain to refer to party loyalty [...] "when the gravity of the war situation required national unity". Lloyd George joined the attackers and Churchill concluded the debate with a vigorous speech in support of the government. When the division took place, the government, which had a normal majority of over 200, prevailed by only 81, with 38MPs in receipt of the government whip voting against it, with between 20 and 25 abstaining.|$|E
