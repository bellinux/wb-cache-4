60|$|Felicia made {{a little}} grimace. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> but the tables near them were unoccupied.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> at the horrified {{faces of}} her friends and burst into tears.|$|E
60|$|More at her ease now <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> {{the room}} and back at him. He smiled.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> uneasily <b>around</b> the ward. Quest, who {{had been}} {{examining}} the post-mark on the package, threw the papers down.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> desperately <b>around</b> {{the cabin}} and at the bed {{unrolled}} on the other bunk. [...] "Night is coming on. You can't stop here. You can't! I tell you, you simply can't!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Cass stared. The {{teamster}} smiled. Miss Porter gazed anxiously at the wagon. [...] "I think I'd like {{a ride in}} there; {{it looks}} awfully good." [...] <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> mischievously <b>around</b> at the lingering and curious congregation. [...] "May I?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{suddenly}} {{occurred to}} Honora, as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> the yacht, that Mrs. Rindge rather haunted her.|$|E
60|$|He was {{surprised}} at the girl's quick comprehension, for <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> the luxurious room with a faint smile.|$|E
60|$|He was {{standing}} by her side now, his hat under his arm. The butler had withdrawn a little into the background. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around.</b>|$|E
60|$|She had {{not thought}} of Clarence. <b>She</b> turned hurriedly, <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> the room, and then peered down the dark stairway.|$|R
6000|$|... "I find it so," [...] she admitted. [...] "You don't at all fit in, you know. A scene like this," [...] <b>she</b> added, <b>glancing</b> <b>around,</b> [...] "would {{scarcely}} ever {{be likely}} to attract you for its own sake, would it?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> half {{carelessly}} <b>around,</b> {{as though}} to see whether she recognized any acquaintances. Arnold, however, was convinced that she was simply anxious not to be overheard.|$|R
60|$|The mirth had {{suddenly}} died from her face. She looked older, tired, and careworn. The shadows were back under her eyes; <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> almost timorously. He filled her glass.|$|E
60|$|She must lure {{him to the}} White Worm's hole--but how? <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> {{and quickly}} made up her mind. The man's whole {{thoughts}} were absorbed by his wonderful kite, which he was showing off, in order to fascinate her imaginary rival, Mimi.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are too effeminate," [...] she said, {{leaning against}} the fence, and shading {{her eyes with her}} fan, as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> in the staring moonlight. [...] "Civilization has taken away your legs. A man {{ought to be able to}} trust to his feet all day, and to nothing else." ...|$|E
60|$|Poor girl, she did {{not know}} what else to say; she was not of a nervous disposition, but there was {{something}} about George's manner that alarmed her very much, and <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> anxiously <b>around</b> to see if any one was within call, but the place was lonely as the grave.|$|R
6000|$|... "I dunno, I seem to {{have got}} through." [...] <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> helplessly <b>around</b> the kitchen. [...] "There don't {{seem to be much}} left to keep me alive.... I guess you'll be wanting your supper, won't you? You hain't often home these days--whatever it is you're doing. I didn't expect you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>glancing</b> <b>around</b> {{as though}} {{to be sure that}} they were not overheard, [...] "there are times when you move me to wonder. In the small things as well as the large, you are so unchanging. I think that you would see an Englishman die, whether he were your friend or your enemy, very much as you kick a {{poisonous}} snake out of your path." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> the sitting-room of her {{apartment}} in Paris one September morning she found it difficult, in some respects, {{to realize that she}} had lived in it for more than five years. After Chiltern's death she had sought a refuge, and she had found it here: a refuge in which she meant--if her intention may be so definitely stated--to pass the remainder of her days.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Hodder is not {{to blame}} for the newspapers," [...] replied Alison, warmly. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> her at the people pushing past, her eyes shining, her colour high, and there was the ring of passion in her voice which had do Martha Preston a peculiarly disquieting effect. [...] "I think it's splendid that they are here at all! I don't care what brought them." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{sank into}} a chair by his side. A slight smile parted her lips as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around.</b> On a table by his side, a table drawn back into {{the shade of the}} cedar tree, were several vellum-bound volumes, a tall glass, and a crystal jug half full of some {{delicate}} amber beverage, mixed with fruit and ice, a box of cigarettes, an ivory paper-cutter, and a fan.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me {{show you}} your room," [...] said Lydia, rising. [...] "This is a curious drawingroom," [...] <b>she</b> added, <b>glancing</b> <b>around.</b> [...] "I only use it {{occasionally}} to receive visitors." [...] She looked about her again with some interest, as if the apartment belonged to some one else, {{and led the way}} to a room on the first floor, furnished as a lady's bed-chamber. [...] "If you dislike this," [...] she said, [...] "or cannot arrange it to suit you, there are others, of which you can have your choice. Come to my boudoir when you are ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> {{flashed a}} <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> the quilt that cowed the gossips. Even Mrs. George Pye's eyes flickered and waned and quailed. Nothing more was said until Sara {{had picked up}} her glasses and marched from the room. Even then they dared not speak above a whisper. Mrs. Pye, alone, smarting from snub, ventured to ejaculate, [...] "Pity save us!" [...] as Sara slammed the door.|$|R
6000|$|She dashed {{back the}} heavy hair matted over her brows by the rain; <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> rapidly <b>around</b> her; <b>she</b> beheld {{the window of}} her bed-chamber with the old simple curtain still hanging at its {{accustomed}} place; she saw the well-remembered trees, the carefully tended flower-beds, now drooping mournfully beneath the gloomy sky. Her heart swelled within her, her breath seemed suddenly arrested in her bosom, as she trod the garden path and ascended the steps beyond. The door at the top was ajar. With a last effort she thrust it open, and stood once more--unaided and unwelcomed, yet hopeful of consolation, of pardon, of love--within her first and last sanctuary, the walls of her home! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{no danger}} {{about that at}} all. But I have to come before you on an {{occasion}} such as this {{as a kind of}} navvy,--and you must accept me." [...] <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> furtively to see whether their guide was looking, but the guide had gone back out of sight. For, sitting on her pony, she had her arm around his neck and kissed him. [...] "And then there is ever so much more," [...] he continued. [...] "I don't think I snore?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Kea's voice sank {{lower than}} ever, and <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> {{her with a}} frightened little gaze. [...] "We don't worship them, you know," [...] she {{answered}} apologetically, under her breath almost; [...] "but we can't help believing there's somebody there, of course, some super-natural being, when we hear Pélé groaning and moaning and sobbing {{in the dead of}} night, or see her casting up huge red-hot stones and showers of lava, whenever she's angry." [...] She paused a moment: then she added mysteriously in a solemn undertone. [...] "There must be something in it. My father knew that. He was one of the bravest and most skilful whalers in the whole Pacific, and he always said there was something in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the topmost}} {{chamber of the}} last of a row of somber gray stone houses in Adam Street a girl with a thin but {{beautiful}} face and large, expectant eyes sat close to the bare, uncurtained window, from which it was possible to command a view of the street below. A book which she had apparently been reading had fallen neglected onto the floor. Steadfastly she watched the passers-by. Her delicate, expressive features were more than once illuminated with joy, only to be clouded, a moment later, with disappointment. The color came and went in her cheeks, as though, indeed, she were more sensitive than her years. Occasionally <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> at the clock. Time dragged so slowly in that great bare room with its obvious touch of poverty! ...|$|E
60|$|And, indeed, why not? <b>She</b> cast a <b>glance</b> <b>around,</b> {{and caught}} a glimpse of Cadmus, Phoenix, and Cilix, who were still in pursuit of the butterfly, almost {{at the other end of}} the meadow. It would be the quickest way of rejoining them, to get upon the white bull's back. She came a step nearer to him therefore; and--sociable {{creature}} that he was--he showed so much joy at this mark of her confidence, that the child could not find in her heart to hesitate any longer. Making one bound (for this little princess was as active as a squirrel), there sat Europa on the beautiful bull, holding an ivory horn in each hand, lest she should fall off.|$|R
60|$|Very timidly, {{and with}} awed <b>glances,</b> <b>she</b> looked <b>around</b> {{her as she}} was {{conducted}} in leisurely manner to the sanctum of the great man at whose bidding she had come. The pictures on the walls, magnificent and impressive even to her ignorant eyes; the hardwood floors, the wonderful furniture, the statuary and flowers, the smooth-tongued servants--all these things were an absolute revelation to her. She had read of such things, even perhaps dreamed of them, {{but she had never}} imagined it possible that she herself might be brought into actual contact with them.|$|R
60|$|Ghita, however, was {{far from}} being at ease. She felt all the risks {{that the young man}} now ran, and she felt that it was on her account solely that he {{incurred}} them. Even the solemn feeling of the hour and the occasion was disturbed by his presence, and she wished he were away on more accounts than one. Here he was, nevertheless, {{and in the midst of}} enemies; and it would not have been in nature for one of her tender years and sex, and, most of all, of her feelings, not to indulge in a sentiment of tender gratitude toward him who had, as it were, thrust his head into the very lion's mouth to do her a service. Between Raoul and Ghita there had been no reserves on the subject of parentage, and the former understood why his mistress was here, as well as the motive that brought her. As for the last, <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> timidly <b>around</b> her, fearful that the lugger, too, had been brought into the throng of ships that crowded the anchorage. For this, however, Raoul was much too wary, nothing resembling his little craft being visible.|$|R
60|$|The {{next time}} he saw Mary Condon was during the Laundry Strike. The Laundry Workers, but {{recently}} organized, were green at the business, and had petitioned Mary Condon to engineer the strike. Freddie Drummond had had an inkling of what was coming, and had sent Bill Totts to join the union and investigate. Bill's job was in the wash-room, and the men had been called out first, that morning, in order to stiffen the courage of the girls; and Bill chanced to be near {{the door to the}} mangle-room when Mary Condon started to enter. The superintendent, who was both large and stout, barred her way. He wasn't going to have his girls called out, and he'd teach her a lesson to mind her own business. And as Mary tried to squeeze past him he thrust her back with a fat hand on her shoulder. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> and saw Bill.|$|E
60|$|She tore a {{strip from}} her ahu and tied the pearl {{securely}} about her neck. Then {{she went on}} along the beach, panting and groaning, but resolutely seeking for cocoanuts. Quickly she found one, and, as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around,</b> a second. She broke one, drinking its water, which was mildewy, and eating the last particle of the meat. A little later she found a shattered dugout. Its outrigger was gone, but she was hopeful, and, before the day was out, she found the outrigger. Every find was an augury. The pearl was a talisman. Late in the afternoon she saw a wooden box floating low in the water. When she dragged {{it out on the}} beach its contents rattled, and inside she found ten tins of salmon. She opened one by hammering it on the canoe. When a leak was started, she drained the tin. After that she spent several hours in extracting the salmon, hammering and squeezing it out a morsel at a time.|$|E
60|$|A comely {{woman with}} a pretty rosebud of a {{daughter}} came to select a gravestone for a twin-daughter, who had died a month before. I {{was impressed with the}} different nature of their feelings for the dead. The mother was calm and woefully resigned, fully conscious of her loss, as of a treasure which she had not always possessed, and therefore had been aware that it might be taken from her; but the daughter evidently had no real knowledge of what Death's doings were. Her thoughts knew, but not her heart. It seemed to me that by the print and pressure which the dead sister had left upon the survivor's spirit her feelings were almost the same as if she still stood side by side and arm in arm with the departed, looking at the slabs of marble, and once or twice <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> with a sunny smile, which, as its sister-smile had faded for ever, soon grew confusedly overshadowed. Perchance her consciousness was truer than her reflection; perchance her dead sister was a closer companion than in life.|$|E
6000|$|A sudden idea flashed upon him. She was {{at least}} sixty yards away; he was half hidden in the reeds and well in the long shadows of the willows. If he {{remained}} perfectly motionless she might overlook him at that distance, or take him {{for one of the}} statues. He remembered also that as he was resting on his elbow, his half-submerged body lying on the plinth below water, he was somewhat in the attitude of one of the river gods. And there was no other escape. If he dived he {{might not be able to}} keep under water as long as she remained, and any movement he knew would betray him. He stiffened himself and scarcely breathed. Luckily for him his attitude had been a natural one and easy to keep. It was well, too, for she was evidently in no hurry and walked slowly, stopping from time to time to admire the basin and its figures. Suddenly he was instinctively aware that she was looking towards him and even changing her position, moving her pretty head and shading her eyes with her hand as if for a better view. He remained motionless, scarcely daring to breathe. Yet there was something so innocently frank and undisturbed in her observation, that he knew as instinctively that she suspected nothing, and took him for a half-submerged statue. He breathed more freely. But presently <b>she</b> stopped, <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> her, and, keeping her eyes fixed in his direction, began to walk backwards slowly until she reached a stone balustrade behind her. On this she leaped, and, sitting down, opened in her lap the sketch-book she was carrying, and, taking out a pencil, to his horror began to sketch! ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{some time}} the girl remains in contemplation at her window. Then she leaves her post, and almost {{immediately}} reappears at a door leading into the garden. Her figure, as she advances towards the lawn before her, is light and small--a natural grace and propriety appear in her movements--she holds pressed to her bosom and half concealed by her robe, a gilt lute. When she reaches a turf bank commanding the same view as the window, she arranges her instrument upon her knees, and with something of restraint in her manner gently touches the chords. Then, as if alarmed at the sound she has produced, <b>she</b> <b>glances</b> anxiously <b>around</b> her, apparently fearful of being overheard. Her large, dark, lustrous eyes have in them an expression of apprehension; her delicate lips are half parted; a sudden flush rises in her soft, olive complexion as she examines {{every corner of the}} garden. Having completed her survey without discovering any cause for the suspicions she seems to entertain, she again employs herself over her instrument. Once more she strikes the chords, and now with a bolder hand. The notes she produces resolve themselves into a wild, plaintive, irregular melody, alternately rising and sinking, as if swayed by the fickle influence of a summer wind. These sounds are soon harmoniously augmented by the young minstrel's voice, which is calm, still, and mellow, and adapts itself with exquisite ingenuity to every arbitrary variation in the tone of the accompaniment. The song that she has chosen is one of the fanciful odes of the day. Its chief merit to her lies in its alliance to the strange Eastern air which she heard at her first interview with the senator who presented her with the lute. Paraphrased in English, the words of the composition would run thus:-- ...|$|R
60|$|No; {{she was a}} lone widow {{with nine}} children, six of whom were already in the lone churchyard on the hill, and the others lying ill with measles and scarlet fever beside her. She had just walked many weary miles that day, and had often begged from door to door for a slice of bread for the {{starving}} little ones. It was of no use now--they would die! They would never see their dear mother again. This was a favorite imaginative situation of Polly's, but only indulged when her companions were asleep, partly because she could not trust confederates with her more serious fancies, and partly because they were at such times passive in her hands. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> timidly <b>around.</b> Satisfied {{that no one could}} observe her, she softly visited the bedside of each of her companions, and administered from a purely fictitious bottle spoonfuls of invisible medicine. Physical correction in the form of slight taps, which they always required, and in which Polly was strong, was only withheld now from a sense of their weak condition. But in vain; they succumbed to the fell disease,--they always died at this juncture,--and Polly was left alone. She thought of the little church where she had once seen a funeral, and remembered the nice smell of the flowers; she dwelt with melancholy satisfaction of the nine little tombstones in the graveyard, each with an inscription, and looked forward with gentle anticipation to the long summer days when, with Lady Mary in her lap, she would sit on those graves clad in the deepest mourning. The fact that the unhappy victims at times moved as it were uneasily in their graves, or snored, did not affect Polly's imaginative contemplation, nor withhold the tears that gathered in her round eyes.|$|R
