40|$|While {{attempting}} to overcome certain control problems during a sortie, the adaptor {{of one of}} the electronic pods of an aircraft carrying stores, got sheared off. A bolt connecting the adaptor to the pylon was found broken. Fractographic studies confirmed that the bolt connecting the electronic nod to the adaptor and the adaptor itself had failed by overload. Use of twin <b>suspension</b> <b>hooks</b> is recommended for better stability during flight...|$|R
40|$|This bachelorâ€™s degree thesis {{deals with}} the specification, design and {{subsequent}} construction of a CNC wire bending machine for use with aluminium alloys. The machine is designed for bending <b>suspension</b> <b>hooks</b> and tension springs for use in anodizing processes. This thesis also briefly describes the anodizing process, outlines specifics of the suspension parts, {{the current state of}} the wire bending machine market and the solution design. Finally there is a breakdown of the individual parts...|$|R

50|$|The {{store is}} mounted by locking the store's lugs with L-shaped <b>suspension</b> <b>hooks</b> in the rack. Depending on {{the mass of}} the store there can be a single lug or a number of lugs on the store {{separated}} by a certain distance. The distances are standardized. For NATO there is the 14-inch suspension for a lighter or 30-inch suspension for heavier stores. Depending on specific stores from 1000 lb upward 3 or 4 lugs can be used within the defined suspension range. For Russian stores there is the standard 110 mm suspension for helicopters or the 250 mm suspension. To keep stores from rocking sideways as the aircraft maneuvers, sway braces are provided to steady the stores. Sway braces are bolted to the rack frame. These may be automatically or manually adjusted.|$|R

50|$|Stelarc's {{idiosyncratic}} performances often involve robotics {{or other}} relatively modern technology integrated with his body. In 26 different performances he has suspended himself in flesh <b>hook</b> <b>suspension,</b> often {{with one of}} his robotic inventions integrated. His last suspension performance was held in Melbourne in March 2012.|$|R
50|$|A superman {{suspension}} is {{the opposite}} of a coma <b>suspension</b> - the <b>hooks</b> are placed in the back and legs, usually in two rows, such that the suspendee is lying face down. This type of suspension is named superman due to the similarity in appearance to Superman flying.|$|R

5000|$|At age four Musafar {{claimed to}} have {{experienced}} dreams of past lives. He reports having given himself his first body piercing when he was twelve. Based on his viewing of anthropological works he first performed his idea of a flesh <b>hook</b> <b>suspension</b> in 1966 or 1967. As an adult he gave himself the name [...] "Fakir Musafar".|$|R
50|$|A {{more extreme}} form of play {{piercing}} is flesh <b>hook</b> <b>suspension</b> {{where a person}} is suspended vertically or horizontally {{by one or more}} hooks through their flesh. This practice is done in some cultures as a rite of passage or as part of a BDSM performance. There are also dance rituals in which flesh hooks attached to multiple people are attached together.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{primitives}} {{or urban}} primitives {{are people in}} developed and culturally altered post-colonial nations who engage in body modification rituals and practices while making reference or homage to the rite of passage practices in [...] "primitive cultures". These practices may include body piercing, tattooing, play piercing, flesh <b>hook</b> <b>suspension,</b> corset training, scarification, branding, and cutting. The motivation for engaging in these varied practices may be personal growth, rite of passage, or spiritual or sexual curiosity.|$|R
50|$|Stelarc is a {{performance}} artist who has visually probed and acoustically amplified his body. He uses medical instruments, prosthetics, robotics, virtual reality systems, the Internet and biotechnology to explore alternate, intimate and involuntary interfaces with the body. He has made three {{films of the}} inside of his body and has performed with a third hand and a virtual arm. Between 1976-1988 he completed 25 body <b>suspension</b> performances with <b>hooks</b> into the skin. For 'Third Ear' he surgically constructed an extra ear within his arm that was internet enabled, making it a publicly accessible acoustical organ for people in other places. He is presently performing as his avatar from his second life site.|$|R
5000|$|... ===Knee=== This <b>suspension</b> {{takes place}} <b>hooked</b> from the knees and hung {{vertically}} {{with the head}} closest {{to the ground and}} the knees at the top. There is no standard for hook placement on this suspension, as it depends almost solely on the anatomy of the suspendee. Some people refer to this as a [...] "Falkner" [...] suspension since Allen Falkner is the first known person to ever attempt this particular configuration. This style is relatively new, but is quickly growing in popularity. It is not considered to be an extremely painful suspension, but the drawbacks include lower back pain and ripping of skin in the areas around the knees. Another factor of this suspension is the increased blood pressure to the brain due to the inverted position, which can lead to disorientation and cause headaches.|$|R

6000|$|He was absorbed, {{even while}} he dressed, {{in the effort}} to achieve intelligibly to himself some such {{revolution}} when, by the first post, Miriam's note arrived. At first it did little to help his agility--it made him, seeing her esthetic faith as so much stronger and simpler than his own, wonder how he should keep with her at her high level. Ambition, in her, was always on the rush, and she was not a person to conceive that others might in bad moments listen for the trumpet in vain. It would never have occurred to her that only the day before he had spent a part of the afternoon quite {{at the bottom of the}} hill. He had in fact turned into the National Gallery and had wandered about there for more than an hour, and it was just while he did so that the immitigable recoil had begun perversely to make itself felt. The perversity was all the greater from the fact that if the experience was depressing this was not because he had been discouraged beyond measure by the sight of the grand things that had been done--things so much grander than any that would ever bear his signature. That variation he was duly acquainted with and should know in abundance again. What had happened to him, as he passed on this occasion from Titian to Rubens and from Gainsborough to Rembrandt, was that he found himself calling the whole exhibited art into question. What was it after all at the best and why had people given it so high a place? Its weakness, its limits broke upon him; tacitly blaspheming he looked with a lustreless eye at the palpable, polished, [...] "toned" [...] objects designed for <b>suspension</b> on <b>hooks.</b> That is, he blasphemed if it were blasphemy to feel that as bearing on the energies of man they were a poor and secondary show. The human force producing them was so far from one of the greatest; their place was a small place and their connexion with the heroic life casual and slight. They represented so little great ideas, and it was great ideas that kept the world from chaos. He had incontestably been in much closer relation with them a few months before than he was to-day: it made up a great deal for what was false and hollow, what was merely personal, in [...] "politics" [...] that, were the idea greater or smaller, they could at their best so directly deal with it. The love of it had really been much of the time at the bottom of his impulse to follow them up; though this was not what he had most talked of with his political friends or even with Julia. No, political as Julia was, he had not conferred with her much about the idea. However, this might have been his own fault quite as much as hers, and she in fact took such things, such enthusiasms, for granted--there was an immense deal in every way that she took for granted. On the other hand, he had often put forward this brighter side of the care for the public weal in his discussions with Gabriel Nash, to the end, it is true, of making that worthy scoff aloud at what he was pleased to term his hypocrisy. Gabriel maintained precisely that there were more ideas, more of those that man lived by, in a single room of the National Gallery than in all the statutes of Parliament. Nick had replied to this more than once that the determination of what man did live by was required; to which Nash had retorted (and it was very rarely that he quoted Scripture) that it was at any rate not by bread and beans alone. The statutes of Parliament gave him bread and beans tout au plus.|$|R
