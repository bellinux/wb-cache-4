50|$|Further, the tuber {{contains}} 48-54% starch, {{which consists}} of 96-99.9% amylopectin. This is a very high value and especially interesting for food processing, where low <b>solubilisation</b> and retrogradation are important. Because of the high starch and amylopectin content, ahipa is a good material for the starch industry. Further, the suitability of the Andean bean depends on other factors such as extractability of the starch, {{the diameter of the}} starch granules or particles and their distribution. After nine months, the starch granules are very homogenously distributed in the tuber. There is a high percentage of granules, which show the same size of about 12-18 μm diameter. This indicates that the tuber growth is completed. P. ahipa can produce 19-28% sugars in its root.|$|E
50|$|A {{class of}} small (14-20 Kd) {{water-soluble}} proteins, called odorant binding proteins (OBPs), first {{discovered in the}} insect sensillar lymph but {{also found in the}} mucus of vertebrates, is postulated to mediate the <b>solubilisation</b> of hydrophobic odorant molecules, and thereby to facilitate their transport to the receptor neurons. The product of a gene expressed in the olfactory system of Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly), OS-D, shares features common to vertebrate odorant-binding proteins, but has a primary structure unlike odorant-binding proteins. OS-D derivatives have subsequently been found in chemosensory organs of phylogenetically distinct insects, including cockroaches, phasmids and moths, suggesting that OS-D-like proteins seem to be conserved in the insect phylum. OS-D and related proteins are members of the insect pheromone-binding family A10/OS-D.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to conduct a number of {{controlled}} digestions to obtain easily comparable cellulose <b>solubilisation</b> rates and to compare these rates to those found in the literature to see which operational differences were significant in affecting cellulose degradation during anaerobic digestion. The results suggested that differences in volumetric cellulose <b>solubilisation</b> rates were not indicative of the true performance of cellulose digestion systems. When cellulose <b>solubilisation</b> rates were normalised by the mass of cellulose in the reactor at each time step, the comparison of the rates became more meaningful. Cellulose <b>solubilisation</b> was surface area limited. Therefore, changes in the loading rate of cellulose to the reactor altered the volumetric <b>solubilisation</b> rate without changing the mass normalised rate. Comparison of mass normalised <b>solubilisation</b> rates from this study and the literature demonstrated that differences in reactor configuration and operational conditions did not significantly impact on the <b>solubilisation</b> rate whereas the difference in composition of the microbial communities showed a marked effect. This work highlights the importance of using appropriately normalised data when making comparisons between systems with differing operational conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The <b>solubilisation</b> of lipid {{membranes}} by detergents is {{a common}} technique in the purification and isolation of proteins and {{in the study of}} membrane proteins. Biophysical studies of these <b>solubilisation</b> processes using ensemble-averaging techniques have provided an integrated picture of the <b>solubilisation</b> mechanism that involves three states: the detergent is taken up in stage I without <b>solubilisation</b> (vesicle regime); stage II refers to the coexistence of detergent-saturated membranes and mixed detergent-lipid micelles and finally stage III corresponds to complete membrane <b>solubilisation</b> leading to the formation of mixed micelles (micellar regime). Although the three-state hypothesis is a didactic and simple thermodynamic model, it is known that detergent lipid-interactions induce a much more complex and diverse dynamic transition between both regimes. These dynamic changes include transmembrane lipid motion (flip-flop), swelling and breakdown of the membrane permeability barrier and fusion between vesicles. To date, whether these processes are independent of each other and take place sequentially, or if they are somehow interconnected is an open question. Here, we have used single-molecule FRET to monitor the <b>solubilisation</b> dynamics of single POPC/POPS vesicles induced by the non-ionic detergent Triton-X 100. Using this approach {{we have been able to}} unambiguously separate within a single FRET trajectory the swelling, permeabilization and lysis steps of the <b>solubilisation</b> process and their kinetic details above and below the critical micellar concentration.
