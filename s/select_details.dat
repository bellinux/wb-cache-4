40|$|This article {{explores the}} ways in which Antonioni's work of the early 1960 s {{constitutes}} a historically embedded, yet still radical cinema in which the filmmaker's famous modernism and a highly developed form of realism coexist in provocative and generative ways. Moving across interconnected analyses of <b>select</b> <b>details</b> from L'avventura (1960), La notte (1961), L'eclisse (1962), and Il deserto rosso (1964), the article argues that these films enfold the inherent dialectical tension of the realism/modernism relationship into an especially tight, impossible-to-unpack expression. The result is a proper cinematic encapsulation and response to contemporary history in the most immediately felt, critical and philosophical sense...|$|E

This project studies different compact living situations and explores the techniques utilized to make compact spaces habitable, comfortable, and valuable in our society. It highlights various multi-functional mechanisms, transformations, and flexibility used in compact living which provides efficient and comfortable means of living. Evaluating the housing crisis of 2008, {{the current state of}} housing costs, affordability, and ownership will begin to illustrate how compact living can become a meaningful solution to today’s living standards. Discussing issues of urban sprawl and traffic congestion, integral to our lifestyle patterns, will exhibit the adversarial effect of the causative low-density urban development of Honolulu. This project will reconsider how density can be increased in low density areas, and will utilize Liliha, Honolulu as the project site. The goal of the design is to utilize elements of compact living to improve housing and urban conditions. It will assess these urban development and zoning conditions, and will study <b>select</b> <b>details</b> of typology. These will be discussed in various maps, diagrams, and drawings which drive the final design of the project. The design of this project emphasizes the walk-up typology which can be found throughout Liliha neighborhood and Honolulu. It studies the current design of a typical walk-up and reconfigures it, keeping effective elements and eliminating unsuccessful ones. It then applies multi-functional mechanisms, transformations, and flexible elements studied {{to improve the quality of}} the living space and the urban fabric...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) {{signal is}} {{considered as one}} of the most important tools in clinical practice in order to assess the cardiac status of patients. In this study, an improved QRS (Q wave, R wave, S wave) complex detection algorithm is proposed based on the multiresolution wavelet analysis. In the first step, high frequency noise and baseline wander can be distinguished from ECG data based on their specific frequency contents. Hence, removing corresponding detail coefficients leads to enhance the performance of the detection algorithm. After this, the author's method is based on the power spectrum of decomposition signals for <b>selecting</b> <b>detail</b> coefficient corresponding to the frequency band of the QRS complex. Hence, the authors have proposed a function g as the combination of the <b>selected</b> <b>detail</b> coefficients using two parameters λ 1 and λ 2, which correspond to the proportion of the frequency ranges of the <b>selected</b> <b>detail</b> compared with the frequency range of the QRS complex. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the whole arrhythmia database. It presents considerable capability in cases of low signal-to-noise ratio, high baseline wander and abnormal morphologies. The results of evaluation show the good detection performance; they have obtained a global sensitivity of 99. 87 %, a positive predectivity of 99. 79 % and a percentage error of 0. 34 %...|$|R

40|$|Photographic {{cropping}} is the act {{of selecting}} part of a photograph to enhance its aesthetic appearance or visual impact. It is common practice with both professional (expert) and amateur (non-expert) photographers. In a psychometric study, McManus et al. (2011 b) showed that participants cropped photographs confidently and reliably. Experts tended to <b>select</b> <b>details</b> from {{a wider range of}} positions than non-experts, but other croppers did not generally prefer details that were selected by experts. It remained unclear, however, on what grounds participants selected particular details from a photograph while avoiding other details. One of the factors contributing to cropping decision may be visual saliency. Indeed, various saliency-based computer algorithms are available for the automatic cropping of photographs. However, careful experimental studies on the relation between saliency and cropping are lacking to date. In the present study, we re-analyzed the data from the studies by McManus et al. (2011 a,b), focusing on statistical image properties. We calculated saliency-based measures for details selected and details avoided during cropping. As expected, we found that selected details contain regions of higher saliency than avoided details on average. Moreover, the saliency center-of-mass was closer to the geometrical center in selected details than in avoided details. Results were confirmed in an eye tracking study with the same dataset of images. Interestingly, the observed regularities in cropping behavior were less pronounced for experts than for non-experts. In summary, our results suggest that, during cropping, participants tend to select salient regions and place them in an image composition that is well-balanced with respect to the distribution of saliency. Our study contributes to the knowledge of perceptual bottom-up features that are germane to aesthetic decisions in photography and their variability in non-experts and experts...|$|E

To accomplish this aim, Vázquez offers more than merely the elements typically constituting a synoptic edition.
