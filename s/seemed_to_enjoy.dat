25|$|Nouhad was a shy {{child and}} did not have many friends at school. However, she was very {{attached}} to her grandmother who lived in Debbieh (Shuf area), where Nouhad used to spend her summer holidays. Nouhad <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> the rural village life. During the day, Nouhad would help her grandmother with house chores and fetch fresh water from a nearby water spring. She would sing {{all the way to the}} spring and back. In the evening, Nouhad would sit by the candlelight with her grandmother, who would tell her stories.|$|E
25|$|O'Keeffe had varied careers post-cricket {{including}} as {{a commentator}} on ABC Radio and occasionally the Nine Network. He {{was known for}} his humorous anecdotes, told in the manner of an after dinner speech at a cricketers club, and his distinctive laugh. He especially <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> working with overseas commentators such as India's Harsha Bhogle whom he enjoyed confusing with his colourful Australian language. However, when he concentrated on the game he showed insight born of a career at the highest level together with study of the statistics and history of the game.|$|E
25|$|Many gay {{artists and}} intellectuals like Reinaldo Arenas were {{attracted}} to the socialist promise of an egalitarian society, which would {{pave the way for}} cultural and sexual freedom and social justice. Gay writers largely wrote the popular journal Lunes de Revolución. Its radical ideas <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> the favor of the Cuban government. But a couple of years after Castro's rise to power, this journal was closed down amidst a wave of media censorship. Its gay writers were publicly disgraced, refused publication, and dismissed from their jobs. Some were reassigned to work as janitors and labourers.|$|E

25|$|After the war, {{although}} Cliff was occasionally {{nostalgic for}} the 'Bizarre' years, as witnessed in personal letters to friends, {{she seemed to}} be realistic and accepted the commercial taste was for conservative ware. Clarice <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> playing a lesser role at the factory, knowing that she could not recapture those crazy days of the thirties. Much of the post-war production went to Australia, New Zealand or North America, where the taste was for formal ware in traditional English designs such as Tonquin rather than the striking patterns and shapes that had established Cliff's reputation; thus she was never to return to creative work. The post-war ware has little value at auction.|$|E
25|$|Australia won the toss again, {{and chose}} to bat. Openers Marsh and Taylor again got the {{tourists}} {{off to a}} solid start, but their heroics of the fifth test {{were not to be}} repeated, as Marsh was caught by debutant Igglesden off Galdstone Small for 17, the opening stand worth 48. David Boon came to the wicket and looked at ease, as he and Taylor set about building a solid second wicket partnership. The pair batted throughout the morning, and Taylor soon brought up his fifty. The young New South Welshman had been in majestic form throughout the series, and England had no answers for the well-timed left-hander. He pulled and drove with ease once again, to bring up his milestone. Boon likewise approached his half-century, but soon lost his partner Taylor, who rarely edged a ball outside off-stump of the bowling of Igglesden to be caught behind, and give the bowler his first ever test wicket. Taylor had gone for 71, and Australia were 130 for 2. Boon fell shortly after for 46, bringing Dean Jones to the wicket to partner his captain Allan Border. The pair <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> each other's company, and once again built a solid 4th wicket partnership, batting throughout the remainder of the first day. Jones was in a hurry and scored freely, all around the wicket, working the field for quick singles and twos, and picking off the bad balls for four. Shortly before stumps he brought up his second century of the tour. At stumps on day one, Australia ended on 325 for 3, with Border not out on 66 and Jones on 114 not out.|$|E

500|$|Hawking {{had been}} asked to appear on the show {{previously}} but was too ill to do so. Bill Prady stated that Stephen Hawking was always their [...] "dream guest star" [...] for the show, but that Hawking appearing was [...] "a long shot of astronomical proportions". Hawking is a fan of The Big Bang Theory and requested to watch a rehearsal of the episode after filming his scene. Simon Helberg, who plays Howard, does an impression of Hawking's voice in the episode; he felt slightly uncomfortable mimicking Hawking, but Hawking <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> the impression.|$|E
500|$|Many of Teller's {{colleagues were}} irritated that he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> taking full credit for {{something}} he had only a part in, and in response, with encouragement from Enrico Fermi, Teller authored an article titled [...] "The Work of Many People," [...] which appeared in Science magazine in February 1955, emphasizing {{that he was not}} alone in the weapon's development. He would later write in his memoirs that he had told a [...] "white lie" [...] in the 1955 article in order to [...] "soothe ruffled feelings", and claimed full credit for the invention.|$|E
500|$|... "Miss Millie," [...] {{always a}} {{champion}} of southern traditions, was a woman of powerful personality, commanding presence, and fearlessly outspoken opinions; she was known widely for the speeches she delivered in hoop skirts. For all her decorum, she <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> the protracted battles over the plaster goats that stood {{at the end of}} the dormitory's long veranda. The college boys periodically painted these animals in their school colors, red and black. At last they were broken when the boys attempted to hide them; some of the former belles of Lucy Cobb still cherish pieces of the goats as souvenirs.|$|E

500|$|During the 1980s, Simone {{performed}} {{regularly at}} Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London, where she recorded the album Live at Ronnie Scott's in 1984. Although her early on-stage style could be somewhat haughty and aloof, in later years, Simone particularly <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> engaging her audiences sometimes by recounting humorous anecdotes {{related to her}} career and music and by soliciting requests. In 1987, the original 1958 recording of [...] "My Baby Just Cares for Me" [...] was used in a commercial for Chanel No. 5 perfume in Britain. This led to a re-release of the recording, which stormed to number 4 on the UK's NME singles chart, giving her a brief surge in popularity in the UK.|$|E
500|$|From {{mid to late}} 1967, Syd Barrett's erratic {{behaviour}} {{became more}} apparent, and at one performance of the band's first US tour, he slowly detuned his guitar while on stage. The audience, used to the band's experimental performances, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> such antics, and were unaware {{of the rest of}} the band's increasing consternation. Interviewed on Pat Boone's show during this tour, Barrett's reply to Boone's questions was a [...] "blank and totally mute stare", and kept his lips closed during the mimed performance. Barrett exhibited behaviour in a similar style during the band's first appearance on Dick Clark's popular TV show American Bandstand. Barrett mimed fairly well for the performance of [...] "Apples and Oranges", but responded to Clark's questions with no interest or enthusiasm.|$|E
500|$|By June 1887, the Emperor's health had {{considerably}} worsened and {{his personal}} doctors suggested going to Europe for medical treatment. While in Milan he passed two weeks between life and death, even being anointed. While on a bed recovering, on 22 May 1888 he received news that slavery had been abolished in Brazil. With a weak voice and tears in his eyes, he said, [...] "Great people! Great people!" [...] PedroII returned to Brazil and disembarked in Rio de Janeiro in August 1888. The [...] "whole country welcomed him with an enthusiasm never seen before. From the capital, from the provinces, from everywhere, arrived proofs of affection and veneration." [...] With the devotion expressed by Brazilians upon {{the return of the}} Emperor and the Empress from Europe, the monarchy <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> unshakable support and to be at the height of its popularity.|$|E

500|$|In February 2002, while {{listening}} to music and playing Soulcalibur with Jesse Reklaw with both playing as Voldo, Chris Brandt noticed that because Reklaw didn't often play video games, he often utilized repetitive motions on the controller to attack. Brandt decided to mimic his gameplay, resulting in {{what he describes as}} [...] "an impromptu dance of sorts". When the music playing in the background changed to [...] "Move Bitch", Brandt noticed a consistent time interval for all of Voldo's motions, and had the character's movement follow the beat of the music. Reklaw noticed and followed in rhythm, entertaining onlookers with the results. Later in September, Brandt met up with Reklaw and other friends, and the subject turned to what had happened in February. Deciding to demonstrate it, the two played against each other using Voldo again, with the characters [...] "dancing" [...] to various songs. Noticing the audience <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> the homoerotic nature of Voldo's animation, and decided to develop something from the concept.|$|E
500|$|Repetition was a {{convention}} used often on Sesame Street. The creators understood that repetition gave young children opportunities to practice new skills and assisted them {{in making a}} connection between new and unfamiliar concepts. They observed that children <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> some material more after viewing them several times, and allowed them to predict and anticipate {{the outcome of a}} sequence. Repetition made it easier to teach complex concepts or situations a child {{would not be able to}} comprehend from a single viewing, and allowed children to explore different facets of a subject. [...] In the early years of Sesame Street, the producers took advantage of repetition as an effective teaching tool by often repeating the same segment many times during the course of an episode; in the first ten seasons, one in six segments was a repeat of an earlier one. The Workshop also learned that varying the details while repeating the same format was also an effective use of repetition.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Price as Nicholas/Sebastian Medina. [...] This was Price's third {{film for}} American International Pictures {{and his second}} for {{director}} Corman. In response to the profitability of House of Usher, Price [...] "upped his asking price for Pit to $125,000, plus {{a percentage of the}} profits." [...] Most critics <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> Price's somewhat hammy performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden victim of his [...] "late" [...] wife's evil machinations. Darrell Moore wrote, [...] "Vincent Price returns to his usual overacting, ego-tripping self in The Pit and the Pendulum. [...] His wonderfully maniacal performance is the high point of the film." [...] And Nathaniel Thompson noted that [...] "Vincent Price has a field day alternating from gibbering terror to teeth-gnashing insanity (sometimes in the same scene)..." [...] Some, however, [...] thought his acting overly theatrical and damaging to the film's mood. [...] Writer Ken Hanke felt the film had [...] "...a few unintended laughs thanks to Vinnie's campiness." ...|$|E

500|$|... "This Is The Life" [...] {{had already}} been {{recorded}} and released as a single in November1984. The song describes the narrator's overly lavish lifestyle and had originally been commissioned for the gangster spoof movie Johnny Dangerously. The album's title track, [...] "Dare to Be Stupid", is an ode to living life stupidly. According to the liner notes of , the song represents [...] "Al's motto in life". The song is a style parody of the band Devo. Devo's reaction was very positive. [...] Yankovic said, [...] "Right after I finished [...] "Dare To Be Stupid", I went over to Mark Mothersbaugh's house and played it for him. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> it a lot." [...] The song was later released on the soundtrack to the 1986 film [...] Yankovic later mused that more people were introduced to [...] "Dare to Be Stupid" [...] the song through the Transformers movie than through the actual Dare to Be Stupid album itself.|$|E
500|$|At the Scorpio Ball Taylor {{wore the}} diamond with the Krupp Diamond, which Burton {{had bought for}} her in 1968, and the [...] "Ping Pong" [...] diamond, which was only [...] of a carat. The [...] "Ping Pong" [...] diamond had cost only $14 and had been bought for her by Burton after he promised her a diamond if she beat him by ten points at a game of ping pong. When people praised her {{diamonds}} at the ball, Taylor would make a show of pretending that they were praising the Ping Pong diamond and not its much larger counterparts. Burton wrote in his diary that [...] "Elizabeth's delight in it is a joy to behold and a very quaint thing to witness is the obvious pleasure that other people take in her wearing it. Even Hjordis Niven and Princess Grace, who are coldish fish, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> her moment. And of course nobody can wear it better. The miraculous face and shoulders and breasts set it off to perfection".|$|E
500|$|As {{the years}} went by and the king became {{increasingly}} prone to outbursts of anger, breaking with all his old relationships, it was said that only in Caroline and their sons' company did Leopold [...] "recapture some of his vitality and Germanic humour". Caroline was described as having been above average in height, [...] "plump but graceful, with a beautiful complexion and skin", with masses of chestnut hair; in character, she was [...] "haughty, sharp, irritable" [...] and ill-educated, and insisted on being treated with respect or else one would have to face the king's displeasure. She was also said to be in possession of [...] "vivid conversational powers" [...] and [...] "dazzling youthfulness". Caroline was well-used to Leopold's [...] "quirks", such as his extreme hypochondria; for instance, when she needed free time for herself, she coughed and pretended to have a cold; she used this [...] "weapon" [...] to keep scheming female rivals from gaining favor with the king as well, telling Leopold that they had colds. Rather than ignore their age difference, Caroline and Leopold <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> it, she calling him Tres Vieux and he calling her Tres Belle.|$|E
