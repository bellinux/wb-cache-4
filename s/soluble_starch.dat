Since S. bovis can produce α-amylase, which hydrolyses starch to single sugars that are further converted to pyruvate for organic acid fermentation (Walker 1965). In this work, with the increase of <b>soluble</b> <b>starch</b> concentration, the activities of LDH and α-AMY, as well as the abundance of LDH and α-AMY, were all increased. In addition, a CCPA gene that encodes global catabolite control protein A (CCPA), which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of LDH and PFL, was up-regulated with excess <b>soluble</b> <b>starch</b> supplied. These results suggest that the abundance of <b>soluble</b> <b>starch</b> regulates the fermentation pathways is at the transcriptional level by CCPA in S. bovis (Asanuma et al. 2004; Antunes et al. 2012). Moreover, LDH of S. bovis specifically requires FDP for activity (Wolin 1964), so LDH activity would be enhanced greatly with an increase of <b>soluble</b> <b>starch</b> concentration. These may all contribute to the increment of lactate fermentation. Once lactate produced is greater than that utilized, the balance breaks, lactate accumulation occurs and pH drops.

When chemical composition was expressed on concentration basis, starch level was significantly higher in setting ovaries at 5 and 6 DAA. Regression analysis showed that these deviations between setting and abscising samples started between anthesis and 1 DAA. We conclude that processes leading to eventual shedding of fertilized ovaries (called flower abortion in soybeans) commence soon after anthesis of the shed flower, and that setting and abscising ovaries do not differ in protein, <b>soluble</b> carbohydrate, <b>starch,</b> or nucleic acid content when abscission processes begin...|$|R
40|$|From 29 d of age until {{slaughter}} (78 d), 282 rabbits {{were fed}} six diets formulated {{in order to}} evaluate the combined effect of dietary protein level (CP: 13. 9 vs. 15. 4 vs. 17. 5 %) and <b>soluble</b> fibre to <b>starch</b> ratio (0. 5 vs. 1. 1). Health status was good in all groups. When dietary CP decreased, diet DM digestibility, daily growth rate and caecal volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration significantly decreased. When <b>soluble</b> fibre to <b>starch</b> ratio increased, diet DM and fibre fractions digestibility significantly raised, feed intake decreased and feed conversion improved; at caecum, VFA concentration increased and N-ammonia level diminished. In conclusions, decreasing dietary CP until 13. 9 % impaired rabbit growth, while replacing <b>starch</b> with <b>soluble</b> fibre had advantages on both performance and caecal fermentations...|$|R
