50|$|The next step, {{the strand}} {{transfer}} reaction, takes place inside the host cell nucleus and involves the critical step of inserting the HIV DNA into a selected {{region of the}} host DNA. The region of insertion contains a weakly conserved palindromic sequence. This strand transfer reaction is initiated as the HIV integrase catalyzes the HIV DNA 3’-hydroxyl group attack on the host DNA. The attack by the HIV DNA occurs on opposite strands of the host DNA in a staggered fashion, typically 4-6 base pairs apart. This reaction leads to separation of the bonds in the host DNA base pairs located between the <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts,</b> and the joining of the HIV 3’-hydroxyl groups with the host DNA 5’ phosphate ends. At this point, the newly joined viral-host DNA region unfolds.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of transposition of the maize Ac/Ds elements {{is not well}} understood. The true transposition intermediates are not known {{and it has not}} been possible to distinguish between excision models involving 8 -bp <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts</b> or 1 -bp <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts</b> followed by hairpin formation. In this work, we have analyzed extrachromosomal excision products to gain insight into the excision mechanism. Plasmid rescue was used to demonstrate that Ds excision is associated with the formation of circular molecules. In addition, we present evidence for the formation of linear extrachromosomal species during Ds excision. Sequences found at the termini of circular and linear elements showed a broad range of nucleotide additions or deletions, suggesting that these species are not true intermediates. Additional nucleotides adjacent to the termini in extrachromosomal elements were compared to the sequence of the original donor site. This analysis showed that: (1) the first nucleotide adjacent to the transposon end was significantly more similar to the first nucleotide flanking the element in the donor site than to a random sequence and (2) the second and farther nucleotides did not resemble the donor site. The implications of these findings for excision models are discussed...|$|E

In lambda DNA, the second A in this sequence is methylated about 50 % of the time by a bacterial methylase absent in E. coli dam.

50|$|The {{cut-and-paste}} transposition {{mechanism of}} class II TEs {{does not involve}} an RNA intermediate. The transpositions are catalyzed by several transposase enzymes. Some transposases non-specifically bind to any target site in DNA, whereas others bind to specific target sequences. The transposase makes a <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> at the target site producing sticky ends, cuts out the DNA transposon and ligates it into the target site. A DNA polymerase fills in the resulting gaps from the sticky ends and DNA ligase closes the sugar-phosphate backbone. This results in target site duplication and the insertion sites of DNA transposons may be identified by short direct repeats (a <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> in the target DNA filled by DNA polymerase) followed by inverted repeats (which are important for the TE excision by transposase).|$|R

The concept is used in molecular biology, especially in cloning or when subcloning inserts DNA into vector DNA.

40|$|Double-strand breaks (DSB) were {{generated}} in the Drosophila melanogaster white gene by excision of the P-w(hd) element. An ectopic P-element vector carrying a modified white gene {{was used as a}} template for DSB repair. All template-dependent repair events were examined, and four different classes of events were recovered. The two most common products observed were gene conversions external to the P-w(hd) element and gene conversions (targeted transpositions) internal to the P-w(hd) element. These two events were equally frequent. Similar numbers for both orientations of internal conversion events were recovered. The results suggest that P-element excision occurs by a <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> that leaves behind at least 33 nucleotides of single-stranded sequence. Our results further demonstrate that an efficient homology search is conducted by the broken end with less than 31 nucleotides...|$|R

30|$|The {{second major}} {{challenge}} to the clinical application of gene editing is to enhance the efficiency of homology-directed recombination (HDR)-mediated precise gene modification while decreasing non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-induced indel production. As shown by various studies, the HDR-NHEJ ratio can be regulated by either changing the expression of machinery mediating DNA repair or optimising delivery methods and timing. A more desirable HDR-NHEJ ratio can be achieved through synchronisation of the cell cycle or utilisation of small molecules as well (Maeder and Gersbach, 2016). More recently, an endonuclease known as Cpf 1 {{has also been shown}} to improve HDR. This variant not only allows the production of <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts,</b> but also needs shorter lengths of RNA (Zetsche et al., 2015).|$|E
40|$|Following {{the sexual}} cycle, hypotrichous ciliated protozoans {{fragment}} {{a set of}} their micronuclear chromosomes to generate the thousands of short, linear DNA molecules present in the transcriptionally active macronucleus. We have used a hybrid selection procedure to examine macronuclear DNA molecules for subtelomeric length heterogeneity to determine whether chromosome fragmentation occurs at unique or multiple sites. The results suggest that multiple, but closely spaced, chromosome fragmentation sites are used by Oxytricha nova. In contrast, Euplotes crassus uses unique chromosome fragmentation sites in a reproducible manner to generate the ends of macronuclear DNA molecules. Additional studies compared DNA sequences {{in the vicinity of}} chromosome fragmentation sites in an attempt to define cis-acting sequences that direct the fragmentation process. A conserved sequence was found near chromosome fragmentation sites in E. crassus. The location of the conserved sequence suggests that chromosome fragmentation involves <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts</b> of the micronuclear DNA molecules...|$|E
40|$|The {{sequences}} in lambda DNA in {{and around}} six sites cut by Hph, a restriction enzyme isolated from Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, are compared. The enzyme produces a <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> around an AT or TA base pair, but the sequences immediately surroinding the cleavage sites bear no obvious relation to one another. Eight (in some cases nine) base pairs {{to one side of}} each cleavage site is the common sequence TCACC AGTGG. Two lines of evidence indicate that these bases constitute part or all of the Hph recognition site. First, mutations in this sequence prevent Hph cutting. Second, dimethylsulfate-mediated methylation of Gs and As in this site prevent cutting, whereas methylation of purines in the region between this sequence and the cleavage sites has no such effect. There is discernible 2 -fold rotational symmetry neither in the common sequence nor around the cleavage sites...|$|R

The endonuclease shows specificity for the intronless form of the td gene. Highly purified endonuclease cleaves the DNA of the intronless form of the td gene in vitro at 24 bp upstream of the exon 1 -exon 2 junction, generating a 2 -base <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> with 3 '-hydroxyl overhangs. Although the endonuclease cleaves in exon 1, it requires some exon 2 sequence for recognition. The maximum recognition sequence lies in an 87 -bp stretch, from 52 bp upstream to 35 bp downstream of the cleavage site, ending at 11 bp into exon 2. The td intron endonuclease appears involved in {{the conversion of the}} intronless form of td to intron-containing td gene in the T-even phages. A role for intron mobility is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{programmed}} DNA deletion {{occurs in}} ciliates during development. In {{this study we}} examine the excised forms of two previously characterized deletion elements, the R- and M-element, in Tetrahymena. Using divergently oriented primers in polymerase chain reactions we have detected the junctions formed by joining the two ends of these elements, providing evidence {{for the presence of}} circular excised forms. These circular forms were detected in developing macronuclear DNA from 12 - 24 h after mating began, but not in micronuclear or whole cell DNA of vegetative cells. They are present at very low abundance, detectable after PCR only through hybridization with specific probes. Sequence analysis shows that the circle junctions occur at or very near the known ends of the elements. There is sequence microheterogeneity in these junctions, which does not support a simple reciprocal exchange model for DNA deletion. A model involving <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts</b> and variable mismatch repair is proposed to explain these results. This model also explains the sequence microheterogeneity previously detected among the junction sequences retained in the macronuclear chromosome...|$|E

McrI recognizes the palindromic hexanucleotide sequence The novel enzyme {{in the presence of}} Mg 2 +-ions cleaves specifically both strands as indicated by the arrows. The <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts</b> generate 3 '-protruding ends with single-stranded 5 '-RY- 3 ' dinucleotide extensions. The McrI recognition sequence was deduced from mapping data on DNAs of bacteriophages φX 174 RF and M 13 mp 18 RF characterized by one and four cleavage sites, respectively. The cut positions within both strands of the recognition sequence were determined in sequencing experiments by analyzing hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds within a Polylinker region of M 13 mp 18 RF DNA containing an additional McrI recognition site including treatment with T 4 DNA polymerase. The novel enzyme may be a useful tool for cloning experiments by completion of the enzymes EclXI (5 '-C/GGCCG- 3 '), NotI (5 '-GC/GGCCGC- 3 '), PvuI (5 '-CGAT/CG- 3 ') as well as EaeI (5 '-Y/GGCCR- 3 ') and XhoII (5 '-Y/GATCR- 3 ') characterized by partly identical sequence specificities...|$|E
40|$|Following {{the sexual}} phase {{of its life}} cycle, the hypotrichous ciliate Euplotes crassus {{transforms}} a copy of its chromosomal micronucleus into a transcriptionally active macronucleus containing short, linear, gene-sized DNA molecules. Tens of thousands of DNA breakage and joining, or splicing, events occur during macronuclear development. The DNA removed by such events includes transposon-like elements, referred to as Tec 1 elements, as well as segments of unique sequence DNA, termed internal eliminated sequences (IESs). Both types of elements are bounded by short direct repeats. In the current study, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing strategy {{has been used to}} examine the fidelity of excision of two Tec 1 elements and three IESs. In all cases, the vast majority of excision events were found to be precise, with one copy of the terminal direct repeats retained at the empty site in the macronuclear DNA molecule. These results, in combination with previous studies that have characterized the excised DNA elements, indicate that the two products of excision (the free element and the macronuclear DNA molecule) share DNA sequences. This suggests that excision events are initiated by <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts</b> in the chromosomal DNA...|$|E
5000|$|Transposon {{sequencing}} {{begins by}} transforming bacterial populations with transposable elements using bacteriophages. Tn-seq uses the Himar I Mariner transposon, a common and stable transposon. After transformation, the DNA is cleaved and the inserted sequence amplified through PCR. The recognition sites for MmeI, a type IIS restriction endonuclease, can be introduced {{by a single}} nucleotide change in the terminal repeats of Mariner. It is located 4 bp {{before the end of}} the terminal repeat. MmeI makes a 2 bp <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> 20 bases downstream of the recognition site. When MmeI digests DNA from a library of transposon insertion mutants, fragmented DNA including the left and right transposon and 16 bp of surrounding genomic DNA is produced. The 16 bp fragment is enough to determine the location of the transposon insertion in the bacterial genome. The ligation of the adaptor is facilitated by the 2 base overhang. A primer specific to the adaptor and a primer specific to the transponson are used to amplify the sequence via PCR. The 120 bp product is then isolated using agarose gel or PAGE purification. Massively parallel sequencing is then used to determine the sequences of the flanking 16 bp. Gene function is inferred after looking at the effects of the insertion on gene function under certain conditions.|$|R
40|$|Endonucleases encoded by mobile group I introns {{are highly}} {{specific}} DNases that induce a double-strand break {{near the site}} to which the intron moves. I-PpoI from the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum mediates the mobility of intron 3 (Pp LSU 3) in the extrachromosomal nuclear ribosomal DNA of this organism. We showed previously that cleavage by I-PpoI creates a four-base <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> near the point of intron insertion. We have now characterized several further properties of the endonuclease. As determined by deletion analysis, the minimal target site recognized by I-PopI was a sequence of 13 to 15 bp spanning the cleavage site. The purified protein behaved as a globular dimer in sedimentation and gel filtration. In gel mobility shift assays {{in the presence of}} EDTA, I-PpoI formed a stable and specific complex with DNA, dissociating with a half-life of 45 min. By footprinting and interference assays with methidiumpropyl-EDTA-iron(II), I-PpoI contacted a 22 - to 24 -bp stretch of DNA. The endonuclease protected most of the purines found in both the major and minor grooves of the DNA helix from modification by dimethyl sulfate (DMS). However, the reactivity to DMS was enhanced at some purines, suggesting that binding leads to a conformational change in the DNA. The pattern of DMS protection differed fundamentally in the two partially symmetrical halves of the recognition sequence...|$|R

40|$|The {{site-specific}} inversion reaction controlling flagellin synthesis in Salmonella {{involves the}} function of three proteins: Hin, Fis and HU. The DNA substrate must be supercoiled and contain a recombinational enhancer sequence {{in addition to the}} two recombination sites. Using mutant substrates or modified reaction conditions, large amounts of complexes can be generated which are recognized by double-stranded breaks within both recombination sites upon quenching. The cleaved molecules contain 2 -bp <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts</b> within the central dinucleotide of the recombination site. Hin is covalently associated with the 5 ' end while the protruding 3 ' end contains a free hydoxyl. We demonstrate that complexes generated in the presence of an active enhancer are intermediates that have advanced past the major rate limiting step(s) of the reaction. In the absence of a functional enhancer, Hin is also able to assemble and catalyze site-specific cleavages within the two recombination sites. However, these complexes are kinetically distinct from the complexes assembled with a functional enhancer and cannot generate inversion without an active enhancer. The results suggest that strand exchange leading to inversion is mediated by double-stranded cleavage of DNA at both recombination sites followed by the rotation of strands to position the DNA into the recombinant configuration. The role of the enhancer and DNA supercoiling in these reactions is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Tn 4451 is a 6. 3 -kb {{chloramphenicol}} resistance transposon from Clostridium perfringens and {{is found}} on the conjugative plasmid pIP 401. The element undergoes spontaneous excision from multicopy plasmids in Escherichia coli and C. perfringens and conjugative excision from pIP 401 in C. perfringens. Tn 4451 is excised as a circular molecule which is probably the transposition intermediate. Excision of Tn 4451 is dependent upon the site-specific recombinase TnpX, which contains potential motifs associated with both the resolvase/invertase and integrase families of recombinases. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acid residues within these domains was used {{to show that the}} resolvase/invertase domain was essential for TnpX-mediated excision of Tn 4451 from multicopy plasmids in E. coli. An analysis of Tn 4451 target sites revealed that the transposition process showed target site specificity. The Tn 4451 target sequence resembled the junction of the circular form, and insertion occurred at a GA dinucleotide. Tn 4451 insertions were flanked by directly repeated GA dinucleotides, and there was also a GA at the junction of the circular form, where the left and right termini of Tn 4451 were fused. We propose a model for Tn 4451 excision and insertion in which the resolvase/invertase domain of TnpX introduces 2 -bp <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts</b> at these GA dinucleotides. Analysis of Tn 4451 derivatives with altered GA dinucleotides provided experimental evidence to support the model...|$|E

Excision and transposition of a nonautonomous Mines transposon {{in the presence of}} a Minos transposase gene was detected with a dominant eye color marker carried by the transposon. Frequencies of excision in somatic tissues and in the germ line were higher in flies heterozygous for the transposon than in homozygotes or hemizygotes. Transposition of a X chromosome-linked insertion of Mines into new autosomal sites occurred in 1 - 12 % of males expressing transposase, suggesting that this system is usable for gene tagging and enhancer trapping in Drosophila. Sequence analysis of PCR-amplified donor sites after excision showed precise restoration of the original target sequence in similar to 75 % of events in heterozygotes and the presence of footprints or partially deleted elements in the remaining events. Most footprints consisted of the four terminal bases of the transposon, flanked by the TA target duplication. Sequencing of a chromosomal donor site that was directly cloned after excision showed a characteristic two-base mismatch heteroduplex in the center of the 6 -bp footprint. Circular extrachromosomal forms of the transposon, presumably representing excised Mines elements, could be detected only in the presence of transposase. A model for chromatid repair after Minos excision is discussed in which <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts</b> are first produced at the ends of the inverted repeats, the broken chromatid ends are joined, and the resulting heteroduplex is subsequently repaired. The model also suggests a simple mechanism for the production of the target site duplication and for regeneration of the transposon ends during reintegration...|$|E
40|$|Molecular cloning is a crucial, {{and often}} speed-limiting, step in many {{standard}} procedures of molecular biology. Ligation of cohesive DNA ends is normally {{carried out at}} 12 – 16 �C to ensure a good balance between enzyme activity and stability of annealed DNA overhangs. Low temperatures generally reduce ligase activity, whereas too high temperatures may reduce cloning efficiencies by melting annealed DNA overhangs and increase overall molecular motion in the ligation reaction. Several procedures have been described {{to increase the efficiency}} ligation reactions, including the addition of condensing agents as polyethylene glycol (1) or hexamminedicobalt chloride (2). These approaches induce macromolecular crowding, and thus serve to mimic higher DNA concentrations in the ligation reaction. Other approaches seek to increase the efficiency of molecular cloning procedures by omitting the ligation step by generating long single-stranded DNA overhangs that can be annealed and transformed directly into an appropriate Escherichia coli host (3). Ligation of blunt-ended DNA fragments is normally carried out at room temperature using higher concentrations of T 4 DNA ligase. We have devised a simple procedure in which high enzyme activity and DNA annealing is balanced by constant temperature cycling. We find temperature-cycle ligations (TCL) may increase the efficiency of <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> cloning ∼ 4 – 8 -fold, while the efficiency of blunt-end clonings are increased ∼ 4 – 6 -fold (see Table 1).

Episiotomies with a postdelivery suture angle of less than 30 ° to the midline are more likely to injure the anal sphincter directly, while those with a suture angle of more than 60 ° are associated with increased incidence of OASIs, as they do not relieve the pressure on the perineum. A safe zone of 40 °– 60 ° has been proposed. Recently, two new types of episiotomy scissors (Episcissors- 60 ® Straight version and angled version) were introduced to ensure a standardized cutting angle of 60 ° to the midline. We audited our results with the angled Episcissors- 60 in spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Materials and methods: Consecutive patients delivering in two private maternity hospitals in Thane, India undergoing clinically indicated episiotomies were included. Only patients delivering spontaneously were included. The scissors were introduced vaginally at crowning, and aligned to orient the guide limb vertically from the posterior fourchette to the anus. While a single cut was preferred, a <b>stagger</b> <b>cut</b> was needed for some women. Postdelivery angles were measured by placing a protractor transparency on the perineum after delivery and marking the angle with an indelible ink pen. Per rectal examination was performed prior to suturing to detect OASIs. Results: A total of 25 women underwent clinically indicated episiotomies. Of these, 16 women were nulliparous, eight women were para 1, and one woman was a para 2. One woman had a vaginal breech delivery (para 2), and the rest were cephalic vertex deliveries. The average age was 27 (range 20 – 35) years. The median birth weight was 2, 800 g (standard deviation 312 g, interquartile range 2, 500 – 3, 000 g). The median postdelivery suture angle of the episiotomy was 50 ° (standard deviation 3. 5 °, interquartile range 48 °– 54 °, range 45 °– 55 °). No cases of OASI were detected in this series. Conclusion: The Episcissors- 60 angled version demonstrated a postdelivery suture angle of 50 ° in a cohort of Indian women undergoing spontaneous vaginal deliveries.

The latter molecules are presumed to be a unique class in that the interruption is not repairable by DNA polymerase and ligase. Preferential radioisotopic labeling of the region immediately adjacent to the interruption, followed by hybridization to sheared fragments of the lambda chromosome with varying guanine plus cytosine content, suggested that the nick resides at {{the position of the}} mature molecular ends of the lambda chromosome. Digestion of the labeled molecules with restriction enzymes and reconstruction experiments in which Hershey circles were generated by annealing of interrupted strands isolated from the relaxed circles support this interpretation. The results indicate that the relaxed circles consist of a population containing one interruption in either of the two strands of the duplex jointly representing the two "nicks" contained in Hershey circles (in which the cohesive ends are annealed).

The reduction in phage yield caused by cosN G 2 C is correlated with a defect in cos cleavage. Three suppressors of the cosN G 2 C mutation, A-E 515 G, A-N 509 K, and A-R 504 C, have been isolated that restore the yield of λ cosN G 2 C to the wild-type level.

In vitro cos cleavage experiments on cosN G 2 C C 11 G DNA showed that the rate of cleavage for A-E 515 G terminase is three- to fourfold higher than for wild-type terminase.
