It causes severe land degradation, and is a major source of sediment and associated nutrients to river systems and ultimately to coastal waters or inland basins. In northern Australia there is widespread gully erosion into unconfined alluvial deposits on active floodplains and terraces (relict floodplains) – here defined as alluvial gully erosion 4. Alluvial gully <b>erosion</b> <b>scarps</b> are locally known as “breakaways” by pastoralists (Figure 1).

40|$|The western {{bank of the}} Detention River estuary has in {{the last}} few years {{suffered}} erosion owing to the active estuarine channel meandering to the west. The main estuarine channel was located in the centre of the estuary from 1971 to 1997 at least, and has moved west after 2004 following increased sand deposition in the mouth. Human activity in the area is further exacerbating the erosion problem, and fallen trees also contribute to sediment erosion. Erosion at this site is not primarily caused by rise in sea-level, though it exemplifies the types of impacts that widespread coastal areas in Tasmania will experience in coming decades. Recommendations to mitigate this erosion problem must be agreed by stakeholders involved, and options include restriction of public access, further removal of large woody debris at the base of the <b>erosion</b> <b>scarp,</b> increasing the sheer strength of the erosion bank by control of runoff and revegetation, and boat wake restriction in the estuary. These actions would all decrease erosive forces at the site. Subject to EIA approval and supervision by a hydraulic engineer this geomorphologists’ report can also support the option of reconstruction of the central estuary main channel at its position around 1988 to 1997, to relieve flow at the erosion site.

40|$|International audienceAt {{the border}} between the Ceará and Pernambuco states (northeast Brazil), the Chapada do Araripe is a high tabular plateau (900 - 1000 m a. s. l.) shaped into Cenomanian fluvial {{conglomerates}} and sandstones underlain by fossiliferous lacustrine or marine Albian layers. The Araripe basin lay at the time at a palaeoelevation close to palaeosea level. We analyse the mechanisms of relief inversion in the Araripe sedimentary basin in relation with local or regional crustal upwarp, in the light of original field and cartographic data. The contrast between the plateau – a near-structural surface – and the surrounding depressions is explained through a study of the <b>erosion</b> <b>scarps</b> that fringe the chapada above sedimentary depressions (east, southwest: segments with cuesta-like landforms and wide inland “peripheric” depressions; cuesta-like landforms and deep box-valleys without wide depressions) or basement surfaces (north, west, south: glints and outliers). No evidence of tectonic inversion is found. Sapping, landslides and other mass movements appear as common processes of relief inversion and scarp retreat, the rates and results of which appear to be controlled by sediment litholoy and paleolandforms of the rifted basement. Geometric relationships with regional stepped surfaces, in particular the low Sertaneja Surface, and exhumed paleosurfaces are analysed. Our estimation of the amplitude of relief inversion (0. 6 - 0. 7 km) differs significantly from AFT-derived estimates reported from Palaeozoic and Mesozoic sandstones, which would imply burial by a considerable thickness of younger section and, later, 1. 5 km of post-rift denudation. The exhumation of surrounding basement surfaces probably began very early, as shown to the northwest of the chapada by the presence of widespread Palaeogene laterites. A later stage of basin topographic inversion, in the Oligocene and later, would correspond to the major stages of river incision, partial planation and basin inversion...|$|R
40|$|Rock seawalls and groynes {{are common}} coastal structures, but these {{flexible}} type structures can be damaged. Monitoring of these structures, particularly after severe events, can enable repairs {{to be implemented}} economically before a major and costly failure occurs. The conventional method, until recently, has been topographic surveys based on total stations or GNSS and ground observations, which can be time consuming, costly, may not fully identify movement or cracking of individual rocks, and can present WH&S issues. This paper investigates the application, accuracy and limitations of UAV (drones) mounted with high-definition cameras. These relatively low cost systems can, with correct operation, ground control and data processing, produce accurate 3 D topographical surveys of structures (< 0. 1 m precision). As an example, a drone mounted with a 12 Mp camera was recently used to capture a 1. 1 km length of Belongil Beach, Byron Bay NSW, which included several rock boulder/rubble seawalls. The drone is owned and operated under CASA regulations by University of Sunshine Coast. Aerial photos were captured along a pre-programmed flight path with 80 % overlap, at a drone elevation of 70 m above ground, with collection of GNSS base data, and ground control, requiring two hours. The aerial images were processed using photogrammetric software (Agisoft Photoscan) to produce very accurate digital elevation models and orthophoto mosaics based on Structure-from-Motion algorithms. The quality of the topographical survey was determined to have a precision and vertical accuracy similar or better than airborne LiDAR with root-mean-square error values of less than 0. 1 m for residuals, capturing the dimensions and position of individual rocks across the seawall structure. The topographic survey and orthophoto mosaics successfully provided an accurate and cost-effective 3 D snapshot of the seawalls that, in turn, provided data for repair of the seawalls as well as updrift and down drift <b>erosion</b> <b>scarps...</b>|$|R

40|$|Suhard Mts., {{part of the}} Northern Carpathians, {{stretch over}} an area of 323 sq km, {{in the shape of}} a  northwest-oriented ridge. This massif is {{composed}} of crystalline schists  (meso- and epimetamorphic), as well as sedimentary rocks pertaining to the trans-Carpathian flysch deposits (i. e. various types of sandstone, conglomerates and marls) in the southwestern sector. Whereas this region is characterized by the occurrence {{of a wide range of}} carbonate rocks, we noted the scarcity of karst forms. Geological survey maps of the area indicate the occurrence of few folded structures; moreover, the massif is mostly part of an ample anticline whereby the axis underlies the valley of Bistrita Aurie river, accompanied by a large syncline underlying Cosna river valley (tributary of Dorna river). The prevalence of crystalline rocks within this anticlinorium results in the overall massif shape of these mountains (hence, the name), which is the foundation for the detail structural and lithological relief forms. The array of structural relief forms includes structural plateaus on sedimentary and crystalline carbonate rocks, and steep slopes in the form of both hogbacks and overthrust scarps. The lithological relief occurs primarily as a result of the contrasting chemical composition of various crystalline rocks, whereas sedimentary rocks seldom generate such forms and solely when favored by the structure, as well. Consequently, carbonate rocks are rather discrete and only stand out in the form of clints (lapies) and gorges, or hums. As regards the matter of denudation surfaces, which has proved rather difficult to solve, we were able to determine the presence of an erosion surface ranging from 1200 - 1300 m to 1500 - 1600 m, wherein neotectonics played a significant role by fragmenting the original surface, particularly in the northwestern sector, where its fragments descend in the shape of consecutive steps towards Rotunda saddle.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The Northwest Hueco Basin, located in the Northern Chihuahuan Desert, is a fault bounded basin filled predominantly with Plio-Pleistocene unconsolidated sediments. The basin contains long linear depressions that dominate the surface topography. The depressions are basin parallel, striking north-northeast, and range in length from less than one to about thirty kilometers. The depressions initially formed as a result of intragraben normal faulting associated with the southern extent of the Rio Grande basin and range. Excavation into the scarp of a representative depression revealed a vertical fault plane and deformation of the upper Camp Rice sand and gravel. The depressions are about 500, 000 years old based on the relative ages of the deformed upper Camp Rice sand and gravel and the undeformed upper caliche horizon in the La Mesa surface. The process that dominates the maintenance of the depressions is subsidence caused by a loss in volume in the La Mesa surface due to the transport of material from the lower boundary of the La Mesa surface into the pore space of the underlying coarse, unconsolidated Camp Rice sand and gravel. Economic sand and gravel, found on the margins of the depressions, are preserved as thick laterally extensive deposits. The normal faulting, that initially formed the depressions, preserved the sand and gravel by dropping it down relative to the basin floor protecting the unconsolidated material from <b>erosion.</b> <b>Scarp</b> height may be a function {{of the nature of the}} sand and gravel.

During the 2013 / 2014 winter, {{which was the}} most energetic since at least 1948, the beach-dune system at Truc Vert eroded by approximately 180 m 3 per beach width divided equally between beach and dune erosion. Beach and dune erosion was strongly variable alongshore, with cuspate-type rhythmic dune <b>erosion</b> <b>scarps</b> stripped of vegetation with a cross-shore amplitude of 25 m. The alongshore-variable scarps were coupled with an alongshore variability in elevation of the beach, with lower beach levels co-located with the megacusp bays. The following 10 months showed modest morphological beach and dune changes with, for instance, destabilisation of the scarped dune by trough blowouts, scarp slumping and filling and seasonal beach berm dynamics. The most profound morphological and vegetation changes occurred during the subsequent 10 months. Only 1. 5 years after that winter, the beach-dune system at Truc Vert almost recovered to its pre-winter volume, but not to its pre-winter foredune profile. Most of the sand volume recovery occurred during spring-summer-autumn 2015 when approximately 120 m 3 /m of sand naturally came back in the system. The beach volume recovery rate was relatively steady and uncorrelated with wave conditions, with rates twice as large across the megacusp bay profile as across the that of the megacusp horns. During that period, the widened and risen dry beach provided large fetch length enhancing onshore windblown transport and a rapid rising of the backshore. The slumped and filled dune scarp, which was providing a high barrier to aeolian transport from the beach to the dune since the 2013 / 2014 winter, reformed as a dune ramp providing efficient conduit for beach-dune delivery/exchange of sediment {{by the end of}} the study. This process favoured both natural revegetation into the scarp and incipient foredune formation. Despite the reinstatement of natural processes between the beach and the dune, the dune foot was still located landward by more than 10 m on average with respect to its pre- 2013 / 2014 winter position. This study shows that even after the most severe winter over the last 68 years in terms of average wave energy arriving at the coast, beach recovery can be a relatively fast process along high-energy sandy beaches backed by large dunes. In contrast foredune recovery, which timing and magnitude can provide a proxy measure for the resilience of the system to climatic variability and change, is a much slower process that can take years to decades...|$|R

40|$|Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) or drones {{have become}} a cost-effective tool for surveying and mapping. UAV photogrammetry using Multi-View Stereopsis (MVS), known as UAV-MVS, is a technique that combines photogrammetry and computer vision and is becoming increasingly popular for 3 D reconstruction surveys. There {{is a need for}} rigorous accuracy assessment of 3 D reconstructions using UAV-MVS. This thesis evaluates UAV survey design considerations (camera network, camera calibration, and ground control network) and assesses their impact on the accuracy of MVS point clouds. The aim of this thesis is to assess the accuracy of the UAV-MVS survey technique to better understand the scale of change that can be detected. The chosen application area is natural landform change, in this case of a section of sheltered coastline that is eroding at scales that are difficult to monitor from satellite or aerial photography. Quantifying the spatial and temporal scales of the erosion occurring along these often fragile sheltered coasts provides an insight into the response of the landscape to many different variables including sea level rise. The erosion is occurring at the decimetre and centimetre scale and UAV-MVS from low altitude (< 40 – 50 m) can provide 3 D point clouds with 1 – 6 points per `cm^ 2 `. These point clouds are compared to an in situ verification dataset derived using a total station survey (σ ranging between 1 and 2 mm) to assess accuracy. Various UAV survey design and processing scenarios are compared {{to assess the impact of}} camera calibration method, image overlap, inclusion of oblique imagery, ground control survey precision and ground control point (GCP) distribution and density. The use of simulations to predict achievable accuracy is tested. Profiles are used to compare cross sections of the point clouds and visualise point density, accuracy and detected change. Dense point clouds are commonly converted to digital elevation models (DEMs) and differenced to detect and quantify change. The conversion process can introduce artefacts into the data through the interpolation and generalisation process. For this reason the change detection and quantification methods evaluated here are based on point cloud differencing and extracted shoreline comparison. Vegetation edge and <b>erosion</b> <b>scarp</b> edge are two shoreline proxies that are extracted and compared. The results demonstrate that UAV-MVS point clouds of natural terrain can be accurate to < 5 – 6 mm when using precise control (σ = 1 – 2 mm) and 10 – 11 mm when using differential GPS equivalent control (σ = 22 mm). The flying height in these tests was 20 – 25 m above terrain. Comparisons of network simulations and empirical data demonstrate that a simulation can be used to reliably predict object space accuracy for typical UAV operations, where ground control is being established using differential GPS (σ = 22 mm). However, simulation predictions are less reliable when the ground control is established using precise field survey methods (σ = 1 – 2 mm), with achieved accuracy lower than predicted precision. This is attributed to the influence of residual systematic errors in camera calibration. The findings further demonstrate that 70 – 80...|$|R
40|$|Lake C. W. McConaughy, a 63 -year-old manmade {{reservoir}} in the North Platte Valley {{of western}} Nebraska, {{is the largest}} standing body {{of water in the}} state. From the time that Kingsley Dam was completed in 1941 until the present day (2004), many geomorphic and environmental changes have occurred along the shores and within the North Platte Valley. Erosion on the southeastern shoreline of the lake had been perceived as a problem for landowners and managers for at least three decades, but the full scale of erosion was revealed only after a cumulative 18 -m drawdown in lake level: bedrock platforms, extending from cliffs on headlands, as well as minor caves, alcoves, potholes, and beach <b>erosion</b> <b>scarps</b> were revealed. Actual headland retreat since 1941 has probably been on a scale of magnitude of tens of meters. Erosional platforms, however, are as much as 266 m in length, indicating that they are, collectively, the results of a combination of pre-reservoir geomorphic conditions, erosion during reservoir filling, and wave erosion after filling. Serial observations of the shoreline made in the period 1999 - 2002 demonstrated that shoreline erosion continues. Depositional features such as pocket beaches and beach ridges have formed de novo in bays between headlands. Also, a delta that prograded at least 4 km from the North Platte River into the lake between 1952 and 1993 continues to grow, and major morphometric changes have occurred on the North Platte River immediately upstream since 1941 in response to the elevation of the local base level by the lake; most of the change in channel patterns in the river upstream from the delta took place in a mere 8 years from 1952 to 1960. Since 1999, some emergent beaches and areas of exposed lake floor have developed sand dunes; eolian erosion and re-deposition is widespread elsewhere in these areas during periods of high winds, which are frequent in western Nebraska. The water table beneath lands adjacent to the reservoir generally rose until 1953 as the lake was filling. The far-flung irrigation system of which Lake McConaughy is the key element has elevated water tables as far as 250 km from the lake. Since at least 2000, soil salinization (episodic thenardite accumulation) has developed in exposed lake sediments at the western end of the lake. On a smaller scale, groundwater has been discharging lakeward along shoreline beach scarps through springs and seeps while lake levels have been low. Slightly lowering the operating level of Lake McConaughy could slow some of the more dramatic effects of shoreline erosion when the lake returns to its predrought volume, but erosion will continue, particularly at the ends of headlands on the southeastern shore, which are exposed to strong waves driven by northerly to northwesterly winds. Eolian erosion and re-deposition will, on the other hand, continue as long as lake level remains particularly low as a result of drought and the removal of irrigation waters. Salinization can be considered an ephemeral phenomenon, dependent on future management of the lake, but it indirectly represents the potential for larger-scale changes in hydrogeologic systems. The longer-term effects of lake-related water-table changes, both near the lake and downstream in irrigated lands, as well as the ability of the lake to supply irrigation water if drought conditions continue, remain to be seen...|$|R

The modes and rates of relief inversion that lead the upper layers of the Araripe basin to their culminating position are examined in relation with geological structure and regional uplift, through the presentation and discussion of morphostructural patterns and types of escarpments, differential erosion landforms, soil sequences, modalities of scarp retreat, and possible differential vertical movements (tectonic inversion). The geomorphic and pedological contrast between the plateau (a near-structural surface covered by Ferralsols) and its lower surroundings (either an exhumed Pre-Cenomanian paleosurface covered by Plinthosols, or lower surfaces with relatively immature soils of Luvisol type, often associated with Leptosols) is explained through a study of the evolution of the cuesta-like scarps or glints and outliers that fringe the chapada above sedimentary depressions and basement surfaces. A reconstruction of the conditions and chronology of relief inversion and corresponding area reduction is proposed, according to principles and methods of morphostratigraphy and morphopedology. It brings elements for discussing recently published models of episodic burial and exhumation history, based upon interpretations of thermochronological data obtained in nearby regions. This discussion also bears strong implications about long-term landform evolution in northeast Brazil and other passive margin areas.

40|$|Comparisons of topographically {{surveyed}} debris {{lines and}} modelled inundation levels from two very intense cyclones in Western Australia (WA) show close agreement. The largest differences between model predictions and surveyed debris occurred where wave run-up did not overtop the frontal sand dunes and was {{registered in the}} coastal landscape. Excellent agreement was found where dune overtopping occurred, as the debris largely represented {{the height of the}} storm tide. The post-event field surveys also showed a clear relationship between the height of the inundation (about 7 m in one instance), the height of the coastal sand dunes, and the extent of erosion of those dunes. Dunes were eroded vertically, and completely removed, where they were overtopped by the marine inundation (including wave run-up). Horizontal <b>erosion</b> or <b>scarping</b> and landward retreat of the dune occurred where the inundation was well below the dune crest. These observations are significant for policies on set-back distances and minimum habitable floor levels of coastal developments. The results show that these standards need to be above the level of the marine inundation, not the storm tide or storm ‘still water’ level, otherwise buildings erected on filled land behind frontal dunes could be undermined through wave attack and experience structural failure. The field observations and model comparisons of the components of these marine inundations in Western Australia provide confidence in estimates previously used to ascertain the intensity of prehistoric tropical cyclones. The proportion of wave run-up on much less permeable and smoother surfaces (sand versus gravel and coral shingle) was considerably less than that used for estimates of prehistoric cyclone intensities, suggesting that wave run-up may play a less important role in constructing long-term sedimentary records of tropical cyclones...|$|R

The Barcarello synthem encompasses 1 - 2 m thick marine/coastal conglomerates and arenites with a rich warm-temperate “Senegalese fauna” including Strombus bubonius; they belong to two orders of marine terrace (OISs 5 e and 5 c or 5 a) and laterally pass into 1 - 5 m thick, welded colluvial deposits; the latter are composed of both lutitic terrains (reworked soil) and breccias with angular rock fragments (reworked scree and sediment) in a abundant silt or fine-grained clay matrix (reworked soil) containing terrestrial mollusc shells and fossil vertebrates of the Upper Pleistocene Elephas mnaidriensis Sicilian Faunal Complex; their age is correlated with the OIS 5; the lower boundary of synthem is a marine abrasion surface laterally extending to a continental erosion surface; the latter is cutting the Polisano synthem or older rocks. The Imera Settentrionale synthem is made up of Middle – Upper Pleistocene 1 - 3 m thick fluvial deposits located on river terrace surfaces lying between about 5 and 100 meters above the valley bottom; its lower boundary is a stream erosion surface. The Raffo Rosso synthem is composed of 1 - 2 m thick coastal dune aeolian sandstones and sands, 1 - 7 m thick colluvial or gravitational deposits with fossil mammals of the late Upper Pleistocene Pianetti and Castello Sicilian Faunal Complex, 2 - 10 m thick stratified slope {{deposits of}} the last glacial climatic event (OISs 4 - 2); the lower boundary is a non-depositional surfaces at the top of the Barcarello/Imera Settentrionale synthems or older rocks. The Capo Plaia synthem is made up of coastal to continental deposits of the last glacial climatic event end – Holocene age (OISs 2 - 1); its lower boundary is formed by variously originated erosion or non-depositional surfaces; the upper boundary is the present day topographic surface. Significant environmental changes during the Quaternary, directly or indirectly due to tectonic movements (block faulting or uplifting) and/or climatic fluctuations in their turn triggering erosion / depositional processes, appear to originate both unconformity surfaces of regional extent and deposits...|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} erosion of a plateau along an {{escarpment}} may be modeled usng cluster growth techniques, recently popularized in models of drainage network evolution. If <b>erosion</b> on the <b>scarp</b> {{takes place in}} discrete events at rates subject to local substrate strength, {{the whole range of}} behavior is described by a combination of three cluster growth mechanisms: invasion percolation, Eden growth and diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA). These model the relative importance of preexisting substrate strength, background weathering, and seepage weathering and erosion respectively. The rate of seepage processes is determined by the efflux of groundwater at the plateau margin, which in turn is determined by the pressure field in the plateau aquifer. If this process acted alone, it would produce erosion patterns in the form of Laplacian fractals, with groundwater recharge from a distant source, or Poissionian fractals, with groundwater recharge uniform over the plateau. DLA is used to mimic the Laplacian or Poissonian potential field and the corresponding seepage growth process. The scaling structure of clusters grown by pure DLA, invasion percolation, or Eden growth is well known; this study presents a model which combines all three growth mechanisms for the first time. Mixed growth processes create clusters with different scaling properties and morphologies over distinct length scale ranges, and this is demonstrable in natural examples of plateau erosion...|$|R
40|$|Our {{ability to}} predict beach erosion above the still water level (SWL) {{is still not}} {{satisfactory}} {{due to the lack}} of adequate technology to accurately measure the sediment concentration and velocity in very shallow water, including the swash zone where the beach face is intermittently covered with water and exposed to the atmosphere. A simple procedure is proposed here to improve our predictive capability for the particular case of <b>scarping</b> <b>erosion</b> caused by wind-generated waves above the SWL. If the slope at the steep scarp is larger than the limiting slope of the internal sediment friction, the steep face is assumed to be eroded due to the computed offshore sediment transport at the toe of the scarp. The bedload and suspended sediment transport at the toe of the scarp was computed using a time-averaged model that includes the steep bottom slope effect. The model was validated against a novel experiment in a multidirectional wave basin, where scarping was reproduced. The water level was raised in four steps to reproduce the shoreface erosion, berm overwash and berm erosion, successively. Horizontal and tilted berms were tested against similar normal incident irregular waves to compare the performance of the profile without and with ponding, respectively. For the tilted case, ponding appeared when the tilted berm was overtopped. No ponding was observed for the horizontal berm test even when the berm was overtopped. The predictability was estimated using the Brier skill score (BSS). The predictability of the scarping was good (BSS â‰¥ 0. 6) for the horizontal berm test and fair (BSS â‰¥ 0. 4) for the tilted berm test. This decrease in the predictability may be related to the ponding, which is not included in the model...|$|R
40|$|Special issue Geological {{characterization}} of the Galicia Bank Region (Atlantic Ocean, NW Iberia). [...] 18 pages, 9 figures, 4 tablesFive main Pleistocene–Holocene lithofacies are defined in three different sedimentary environments (fault scarp, sedimentary lobe and inter-lobe channel) of the SW Galicia Bank: (1) turbidites (biogenous and terrigenous), (2) hemipelagites, (3) pelagites, (4) debrites, and (5) Heinrich sediments. In the sedimentary lobe and inter-lobe channel, the stratigraphic record consists mainly of turbidites interbedded with debrites and Heinrich sediments and hemipelagites that are covered by hemipelagites or pelagites. In the fault scarp, the stratigraphy comprises hemipelagites and turbidites covered by pelagites. Frequency of turbidite events has varied between 1 / 1. 2 ka and 1 / 3. 1 ka, since 31. 3 ka BP. At least four turbidite events (1 to 4) between 9. 1 and 31. 3 ka BP, have been correlated between the different sedimentary environments. The downslope of turbidity flows prevailed until 9. 1 ka; after which, vertical settling and slow lateral advection have controlled sedimentation. The source area of turbidites and debrites is the fault <b>scarp.</b> <b>Erosion</b> of the slope near-surface pelagites/hemipelagites and ancient outcropping deposits could explain the presence of biogenous turbidites and terrigenous turbidites respectively. The rhythmic development of turbidites interrupted by hemipelagites could represent the manifestation of different pulses of sedimentary instability induced {{by a combination of}} oversteepening (up to 29 °) and occurrence of earthquakesThis work was supported by the Comisión de Coordinación Científica (MEC) Special Action, CICYT (MEC) ERGAP project (Ref.

40|$|The Main Frontal thrust (MFT) uplifts the Himalayan {{topographic}} front. Deciphering MFT deformation kinematics {{is crucial}} for understanding how the orogen accommodates continuing continental collision and assessing associated hazards. Here, we (a) detail newly discovered fault-zone exposures along the MFT at the Mohand Range front in northwestern India and (b) apply contemporary fault zone theory {{to show that the}} MFT is an emergent fault with a well-developed fault zone overlain by uplifted Quaternary gravels over a horizontal length of similar to 700 m. Northward from the front, the fault zone grades from a central, gouge-dominated core to a hanging-wall, rock-dominated damage zone. We observed incohesive, non-foliated breccia, fault gouge, and brittle deformation microstructures within the fractured country rocks (Middle Siwaliks) and outcrop scale, non-plunging folds in the proximal hanging wall. We interpret these observations to suggest that (1) elastico-frictional (brittle) deformation processes operated in the fault zone at near surface (similar to 1 - 5 km depth) conditions and (2) the folds formed first at the propagating MFT fault tip, then were subsequently dismembered by the fault itself. Thus, we interpret the Mohand Range as a fault-propagation fold driven by an emergent MFT in contrast to the consensus view that it is a fault-bend fold. A fault-propagation fold model is more consistent with these new observations, the modern range-scale topography, and existing erosion estimates. To further evaluate our proposed structural model, we used a Boundary Element Method-based dislocation model to simulate topographic growth from excess slip at a propagating fault tip. Results show that the frontal topography could have evolved by slip along a (a) near-surface fault plane consistent with the present-day MFT location, or (b) blind MFT at similar to 3 km depth farther north near the drainage divide. Comparing modelled vs. measured high resolution (similar to 16 cm) topographic profiles for each case provides permissible end-member scenarios of an either dynamically-evolving, high <b>erosion,</b> northward-migrating frontal <b>scarp</b> or a static, low, and symmetric, MHT-related fold, respectively. Our integrated approach is expected to deliver an improved understanding of coupled fault-generated deformation and topographic growth that may be applied more broadly across the entire Himalayan front.

40|$|International audienceA field-based {{experimental}} study of beach scarp morphodynamic evolution {{was conducted on the}} shoreface of a macrotidal sandy beach subject to storms combined with spring tide events (Luc-sur-Mer, France). Both video and in-situ measurements on an artificial berm are used to understand beach scarp evolution over one tide during stormy conditions. Image time stacks are used to analyze the swash action on the beach scarp and topo-graphical data of the scarp are recorded with a terrestrial scanner laser to quantify the morphodynamic response of the beach scarp to wave action. This work provides a new and unique dataset about beach scarp changes and berm morphology in particular under rising tide and oblique wind-wave conditions. During one stormy event, the berm was completely destroyed. However, contrasting alongshore changes were measured during the erosive phase with different crest and foot scarp retreats and eroded volumes between the west and {{the east side of the}} berm. The beach in front of the scarp also shows a contrasting residual evolution, indicating an evident longshore sediment transport on the study area as a consequence of incident oblique wave conditions. A strong connection between beach evolution and beach scarp changes is clearly identified. The <b>scarp</b> <b>erosion</b> increases on the west side of the berm when the beach level is lowered and reduces when the beach surface rises on the east side. The beach slope and foreshore elevation as a result of a longshore sediment transport between east and west profiles, influence swash activity. Overall, water depth and swash activity became progressively different along the scarp during the experiment. Swash measurements indicate that the presence of the beach scarp strongly influences the swash motion. At high tide, the reflection of the uprush on the scarp front induces a collision between the reflected backwash and the following uprush dynamic. These collisions reduce and sometimes stop the motion of the following uprush, reducing the incoming swash excursion. Consequently, the scarp presence modifies the swash interaction that normally appears on a planar beach surface. With a beach scarp, the swash energy level is substantially attenuated and its spectrum is characterized by a large band. The number of uprush impacts on the scarp front calculated from video images reaches about 25 per 5 min. In spite of the swash energy attenuation due to swash/swash interactions, these impacts provoke the berm destruction in about two hours. However, the onshore migration of the swash zone induced by the rising tide appears to be important to explain scarp destruction, compensating the attenuated swash activity due to backwash-uprush interactions...|$|R
