5|$|The Amtrak {{ticket office}} was closed in April 2001 {{as part of}} {{austerity}} measures. Vandalism also forced the closure of elevators. The same year, <b>SEPTA</b> proposed closing the station because it served few inbound commuters. However, advocacy from the Delaware Valley Association of Rail Passengers, which showed that the station was more heavily used by commuters from the Chestnut Hill West Line changing to <b>SEPTA</b> Trenton Line trains and Amtrak Clockers to Trenton and New York, succeeded in persuading <b>SEPTA</b> to keep the station open for the time being. By 2005, no official decision {{had been made to}} permanently keep the station, but <b>SEPTA</b> planned repairs to the deteriorated platforms.|$|E
5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of an epidermal layer, a jellylike mesogloea layer and an inner gastrodermis; the <b>septa</b> are infoldings of the body wall and consist of a layer of mesogloea sandwiched between two layers of gastrodermis. In some taxa, sphincter muscles in the mesogloea close over the oral disc and act to keep the polyp fully retracted. The tentacles contain extensions of the coelenteron and have sheets of longitudinal muscles in their walls. The oral disc has radial muscles in the epidermis, {{but most of the}} muscles in the column are gastrodermal, and include strong retractor muscles beside the <b>septa.</b> The number and arrangement of the <b>septa,</b> as well as the arrangement of these retractor muscles, are important in anthozoan classification.|$|E
5|$|Type I are {{squamous}} {{epithelial cells}} {{that make up}} the alveolar wall structure. They have extremely thin walls that enable an easy gas exchange. These type I cells also make up the alveolar <b>septa</b> which separate each alveolus. The <b>septa</b> consist of an epithelial lining and associated basement membranes. Type I cells are not able to divide, and consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.|$|E
30|$|Transverse vaginal <b>septae</b> are a rare {{cause of}} haematocolpos {{secondary}} to obstructed menstruation. Low transverse vaginal <b>septae</b> are usually resected vaginally, however, medium/high <b>septae</b> {{are often more}} complex requiring a laparotomy. Two adolescent girls presented with obstructed menstruation due to high transverse vaginal <b>septae.</b> We describe the laparoscopic technique {{for the management of}} high transverse vaginal <b>septae</b> {{as an alternative to the}} traditional approach of abdomino-perineal resection via laparotomy. A laparoscopic approach enabled resection of the transverse <b>septae</b> in both cases with the restoration of normal menstruation. Laparoscopic resection of high transverse vaginal <b>septae</b> is a feasible alternative to laparotomy.|$|R
30|$|Transverse vaginal <b>septae</b> are a rare {{cause of}} haematocolpos {{secondary}} to obstructed menstruation. They {{result from a}} failure of canalization of the vaginal plate, where the urogenital sinus meets the müllerian duct. Treatment necessitates surgical resection of the septum and anastamosis of the proximal and distal vagina [1, 2]. The location and depth of transverse vaginal <b>septae</b> can be variable but they are traditionally classified as low (within 3  cm of the vaginal introitus) or mid/high <b>septae</b> (more than 3  cm from the introitus). Low vaginal <b>septae</b> can usually be safely resected with a vaginal approach. However mid- and high vaginal <b>septae</b> cannot be blindly resected by a vaginal approach without a risk of trauma to surrounding structures. Treatment is traditionally via an abdomino-perineal approach requiring laparotomy. We present a novel approach to management of high transverse <b>septae</b> using a laparoscopic approach.|$|R
30|$|Transverse vaginal <b>septae</b> {{are rare}} müllerian anomalies. The exact {{incidence}} is unknown {{but has been}} reported as being between 1 : 2, 100 and 1 : 72, 000 [3]. In 2010 – 2011, there were only 12 documented cases of resection of transverse vaginal septum in England [4], although this figure may be an underestimation due to coding difficulties. Transverse vaginal <b>septae</b> can {{be located in the}} lower, middle or upper third of the vagina. There is no standardised classification of <b>septae</b> but low vaginal <b>septae</b> are usually regarded as those within 3  cm of the vaginal introitus [5]. Mid- and high <b>septae</b> are further than 3  cm from the introitus and high <b>septae</b> may lie just below the cervical external os. The thickness of the septum is also variable but a thick septum is one which measures 1  cm or more in diameter.|$|R
5|$|The heart {{derives from}} splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in the neural plate which forms the {{cardiogenic}} region. Two endocardial tubes form here that fuse {{to form a}} primitive heart tube known as the tubular heart. Between {{the third and fourth}} week, the heart tube lengthens, and begins to fold to form an S-shape within the pericardium. This places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart. Further development will include the <b>septa</b> and valves formation and remodelling of the heart chambers. By the end of the fifth week the <b>septa</b> are complete and the heart valves are completed by the ninth week.|$|E
5|$|North Philadelphia {{station is}} an {{intercity}} rail and regional rail {{station on the}} Northeast Corridor, located on North Broad Street in the North Philadelphia neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's (<b>SEPTA)</b> Regional Rail Trenton Line and Chestnut Hill West Line account {{for most of the}} station's service; five Amtrak trains also stop each weekday, three in one direction, two in the other.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} {{of an individual}} scleractinian polyp {{is known as a}} corallite. It is secreted by the epidermis of {{the lower part of the}} body, and initially forms a cup surrounding this part of the polyp. The interior of the cup contains radially aligned plates, or <b>septa,</b> projecting upwards from the base. Each of these plates is flanked by a pair of mesenteries.|$|E

30|$|Septal {{pattern is}} defined as {{thickening}} of the interlobular <b>septae</b> (i.e. {{the borders of the}} secondary pulmonary lobules). Normally very few interlobular <b>septae</b> are seen in the anterior and lower aspects of the lower lobes on HRCT. Thickened interlobular <b>septae</b> are demonstrated as short lines extending perpendicularly to the peripheral pleura or the fissures, or as polygonal arcades surrounding secondary pulmonary lobules more centrally. Septal thickening can be smooth, nodular or irregular [4].|$|R
5|$|Two {{high-level}} island platforms serve {{three of}} the four Northeast Corridor passenger tracks; there is a center passing track, as well as a fifth track on the south side that is only used by CSX and Norfolk Southern freights. Most <b>SEPTA</b> Trenton Line trains and five daily Amtrak trains (two northbound and three southbound) stop at these platforms. Two low-level platforms, a short distance to the west, serve the diverging SEPTA-owned Chestnut Hill West Line. North Philadelphia has been a flag stop on the line since 1993. The station has relatively low inbound boardings; however, it is used by riders from the Chestnut Hill West Line transferring to <b>SEPTA</b> and Amtrak trains to reach jobs in New Jersey and New York.|$|E
5|$|A {{primitive}} nervous system, without centralization, coordinates {{the processes}} involved in maintaining homeostasis, as well as biochemical and physical responses to various stimuli. There are two nerve nets, one in the epidermis {{and one in the}} gastrodermis; these unite at the pharynx, the junctions of the <b>septa</b> with the oral disc and the pedal disc, and across the mesogloea. No specialized sense organs are present but sensory cells include nematocytes and chemoreceptors.|$|E
5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar macrophage. The two types of cell are known as type I and type II alveolar cells (also known as pneumocytes). Types I and II make up the walls and alveolar <b>septa.</b> Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), and Type II cells generally cluster {{in the corners of}} the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E

5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} lung present. The alveoli {{continue}} to form into early adulthood, {{and their ability to}} form when necessary is seen in the regeneration of the lung. Alveolar <b>septa</b> have a double capillary network instead of the single network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E
5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} prey for larger sharks, {{such as the}} silvertip shark. At Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia, great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran) feed opportunistically on grey reef sharks that are {{exhausted}} from pursuing mates. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Huffmanela lata and several copepod species that attach to the sharks' skin, and juvenile stages of the isopods Gnathia trimaculata and G. grandilaris that attach to the gill filaments and <b>septa</b> (the dividers between each gill).|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum peckiis cells (the hyphae) {{also present}} various {{characters}} useful for its characterization. The hyphae {{that form the}} cap are hyaline (translucent), smooth, thin-walled, and 3–4µm thick. They collapse when dry, but may be readily revived with a weak (2%) solution of potassium hydroxide. Those in the cap form an intricate tangle with a tendency to run longitudinally. They are divided into cellular compartments (<b>septa)</b> and have clamp connections—short branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of nuclear division. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells in the hymenium, are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 35–40 by 4.7–6µm.|$|E

In the Starks' common room, Sansa Stark and <b>Septa</b> Mordane are interrupted by Prince Joffrey Baratheon, who apologizes to Sansa for his earlier behavior and gives her a necklace, vowing that she will become his queen in an elaborate wedding ceremony. Sansa happily accepts the apology, unaware Joffrey has been forced into it by his mother.|$|E
5|$|Most fungi grow as hyphae, {{which are}} cylindrical, thread-like {{structures}} 2–10µm {{in diameter and}} up to several centimeters in length. Hyphae grow at their tips (apices); new hyphae are typically formed by emergence of new tips along existing hyphae by a process called branching, or occasionally growing hyphal tips fork, giving rise to two parallel-growing hyphae. Hyphae also sometimes fuse when they come into contact, a process called hyphal fusion (or anastamosis). These growth processes {{lead to the development}} of a mycelium, an interconnected network of hyphae. Hyphae can be either septate or coenocytic. Septate hyphae are divided into compartments separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called <b>septa,</b> that are formed at right angles to the cell wall giving the hypha its shape), with each compartment containing one or more nuclei; coenocytic hyphae are not compartmentalized. <b>Septa</b> have pores that allow cytoplasm, organelles, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the dolipore septum in fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota. Coenocytic hyphae are in essence multinucleate supercells.|$|E

5|$|The flesh in the cap {{is made up}} of irregularly {{arranged}} cylindrical hyphae from 5 to 15μm wide. They stain a dark reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The flesh in {{the stem}} {{is made up of}} hyphae which run down the stem and measure 4 to 11μm in thickness. The smooth cell walls are colorless, but again stain a dark reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The <b>septa</b> have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The {{flesh of}} the cap {{consists}} {{of a number of}} microscopically distinct layers of tissue. The cuticle of the cap (known as the pileipellis) is between 8–10µm thick, and is made of a loose textura intricata, a type of tissue in which the hyphae are irregularly interwoven with distinct spaces between them. The cuticle hyphae are thick-walled to thin-walled, with scattered inconspicuous cystidia measuring 40–55 by 3.5–5.5µm. These cystidia located in the cap (pileocystidia) are cylindrical, thin-walled, yellow in Melzer's reagent, hyaline in KOH, sometimes with amorphous dingy brown material coating the walls. Beneath the cuticle layer is a zone 54–65µm thick, made of very loosely entwined, thin-walled hyphae, 2–3µm in thickness, with clamps at the <b>septa.</b> Below this is a zone 208–221µm in thickness, in which the densely compacted hyphae, 3–8µm in diameter, have swollen, gelatinized walls, and often more or less a vertical orientation. This in turn is followed by a layer 520µm in thickness, formed of loosely interwoven hyphae, 2–8µm in width, some of which have thin walls with clamps at the <b>septa,</b> whilst others have somewhat thickened gelatinized walls. The {{flesh of the}} cap has a layer of upright hyphae bending into a lower layer of interwoven hyphae with diameters of 2.5–8µm. The flesh of the gills {{is similar to that of}} the lower cap.|$|E
5|$|The lungs of {{lungfish}} {{are similar}} to those of amphibians, with few, if any, internal <b>septa.</b> In the Australian lungfish, there is only a single lung, albeit divided into two lobes. Other lungfish and Polypterus, however, have two lungs, which are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around and above the esophagus. The blood supply also twists around the esophagus, suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body, as in other vertebrates.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{pertains}} {{to the definition of}} a numerical model of the calcaneal fat pad region, considering a structure composed of adipose and connective tissues organized in fibrous <b>septae</b> and adipose chambers. The mechanical response is strongly influenced by the structural conformation, as the dimension of adipose chambers, the thickness of connective <b>septae</b> walls and the mechanical properties of the different soft tissues. In order to define the constitutive formulation of adipose tissues, experimental data from pig specimens are considered, according to the functional similarity, while the mechanical response of connective tissue <b>septae</b> is assumed with regard to the mechanical behaviour that characterize ligaments. Different numerical models are provided accounting for the variation of chambers dimensions, <b>septae</b> wall thickness and tissues characteristics. The spiral angles of collagen fibres within the <b>septae</b> influence the capability of the structure to withstand the bulging of chambers. The analysis considers different orientation of the fibres. The response of calcaneal fat pad region is evaluated in comparison with experimental data from unconfined compression tests. The present work provides a preliminary approach to enhance the correlation between the structural conformation and tissues mechanical properties towards the biomechanical response of overall heel pad region...|$|R
