500|$|For {{the next}} two years, the band played {{throughout}} the Boston area. Eventually Godsmack's CD landed {{in the hands of}} Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station WAAF (FM). The radio station put [...] "Keep Away" [...] into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly. Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of [...] "Keep Away", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled [...] "Whatever", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM). In an interview Sully Erna stated, [...] "We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> started moving over a thousand records a week. (...) I was doing all this from my bedroom. After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off".|$|E
2500|$|One {{event that}} {{affected}} `Abdu'l-Bahá greatly during his childhood was the imprisonment {{of his father}} when `Abdu'l-Bahá was eight years old; the imprisonment led to his family being reduced to poverty and being attacked in the streets by other children. `Abdu'l-Bahá accompanied his mother to visit Bahá'u'lláh who was then imprisoned in the infamous subterranean dungeon the Síyáh-Chál. He described how [...] "I saw a dark, steep place. We entered a small, narrow doorway, and went down two steps, but beyond those one could see nothing. In {{the middle of the}} stairway, all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> heard His …voice: 'Do not bring him in here', and so they took me back".|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Mushroom {{was eager}} {{to connect with the}} 'new wave' in England and brought over Peter Solley, an English {{producer}} and latter-day Procol Harum member, to produce another Mushroom artist, The Sports. One night Solley saw Jo Jo Zep and the Falcons perform, and on the strength of their new song, [...] "Shape I'm In", asked to produce the group. The first single, [...] "Hit and Run", from the album, Screaming Targets, was pop reggae and reached No.12 on the charts in August 1979. Camilleri said he [...] "never thought 'Hit and Run' would do anything but maybe the lick was infectious enough – though as a song it was a bit stupid – but it got us a deal all over the world. It was a wacky thing and all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> were away in a different arena".|$|E

2500|$|All of a <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> had two Australian {{teams on}} one tour... I {{certainly}} felt excluded... At one stage in England I {{was waiting in}} a bar for my teammates to come downstairs, but because everyone was up the street with Packer, they never came... I was certainly disappointed to be left out. At that stage I think I had played nine Tests and was averaging 40 and you had {{other people who were}} barely Shield cricketers being called up by Packer. I didn't know the reasons why those guys were in it and I wasn't. That is always a question I will wonder about. I certainly kept being mates with Hookesy... It was a strange feeling. There were times when we were there to play for Australia and some blokes were off at a meeting about something else. There were times when there were arguments in the bar that got a lot louder than what they should have been.|$|E
2500|$|On November 8, 1992, {{the band}} {{recorded}} [...] "Beautiful Son," [...] "20 Years in the Dakota" [...] and [...] "Old Age" [...] during a recording session at Word of Mouth Recording in Seattle with producer Jack Endino. The three-song session was later released in April 1993 as Hole's fourth single on the City Slang label. On January 21, 1993, Love and Schemel recorded five demo songs at BMG Ariola Ltda. in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Produced by Craig Montgomery, the session was originally a demo session for Nirvana, who were recording material for their upcoming studio album, In Utero (1993). During breaks in Nirvana's session, Love and Schemel recorded {{a number of}} songs later featured on Live Through This, including [...] "Miss World," [...] "She Walks on Me," [...] "I Think That I Would Die" [...] and [...] "Softer, Softest." [...] The band relocated back to Los Angeles where they recruited former Janitor Joe bassist Kristen Pfaff in early 1993; Pfaff was also an accomplished cellist and music student. Erlandson said of Pfaff's membership: [...] "That's when we took off, all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> became a real band." [...] After a brief tour of the United Kingdom {{in the summer of}} 1993, the band sent a series of demos to the record label. [...] "When we got the Live Through This demos, I realized very quickly that Hole had gotten a new rhythm section," [...] said producer Sean Slade. [...] "It was much more musical." ...|$|E

60|$|Our {{journey was}} soon at an end; for, scaling a <b>sudden</b> height, <b>we</b> came {{abruptly}} upon {{the place of}} our destination. I wish that it were possible to sketch in words this spot as vividly as I recollect it.|$|R
60|$|Breakfast over, he and I were {{reclining}} in the main-top--where, {{by permission}} of my noble master, Jack Chase, I had invited him--when, of a <b>sudden,</b> <b>we</b> heard a cannonading. It was our own ship.|$|E

60|$|Then {{all of a}} <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> did {{begin to}} talk; and not of those matters of which the well-bred {{naturally}} converse--the habits of the rarer kinds of ducks, and the careers of our College friends, but of something never mentioned in polite society.|$|E
6000|$|... +Stanza 6,+ 1. 1. And like a <b>sudden</b> meteor. <b>We</b> {{here have}} a fragmentary simile which may--or equally well may not--follow on as {{connected}} with St. 5. See on p. 147, for {{whatever it may}} be worth in illustration, the line relating to Coleridge:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{the whole}} world would have {{declared}} a week ago! As {{a matter of fact}} it is not so <b>sudden</b> as <b>we</b> imagine! The storm has been long brewing! It is we who have been blind. A little black spot of irritation has spread and deepened into a war-cloud." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis {{indeed a}} strong place, Sir Archie," [...] William Orr replied, [...] "and it were assuredly better to slip {{in by the}} gates than to climb over the walls; but after the captures {{of so many of}} their strongholds by <b>sudden</b> surprise, <b>we</b> may be sure that a careful watch will be kept." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of a <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> heard Jehan at the {{stairway}} wake, but a boy pushed past him, and stood before us, the hall rushes in his hair, all slubbered with sleep. [...] "My father! My father! I dreamed of treachery," [...] he cried, and babbled thickly.|$|E
60|$|So {{we passed}} the curtain, and stood upon the portico, looking at the garden misty with moonlight, and talking of this and that--about the Israelites, I think, who, as we heard, were {{wandering}} in the deserts of Sinai. Then of a <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> grew silent, both of us.|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} one {{o'clock in the}} {{afternoon}} when we seemed to be quite close to the green flanks of Umpondwana, that of a <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> cut a wide spoor trampled by thousands of naked feet. Jan and Gaasha got off the waggon to examine it, but Ralph did not move.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{implications}} of sudden stops on output growth and export and import responses. First, we define and identify <b>sudden</b> stops. <b>We</b> show that <b>sudden</b> stops are fairly common since the late 70 s. Then, by looking at this large pool of country experiences we study how openness, liability dollarization and the choice of exchange rate regime shape {{the aftermath of a}} <b>sudden</b> stop. <b>We</b> find that openness and flexible rates contribute to a better output recovery, while liability dollarization worsens such recovery. We also find that open countries adjust the current account through higher export growth and less import contraction while the opposite holds for countries with large liability dollarization. These stylized facts allow to think about what may help an economy prepare for a sudden stop, in contrast with the traditional policy recommendations that concentrated on preventing such events. ...|$|R

60|$|A hedge, {{swinging}} sharp right, flanked the garden, {{and above}} it on a slope of daisy-dotted meadows {{we could see}} Lord Lundie's tiled and half-timbered summer farmhouse.

6000|$|... "I 'm not blind, my dear, {{neither is}} Tom, {{and when a}} young gentleman cuts a call {{abruptly}} short, and races after a young lady, and is seen holding her hand at the quietest corner of the park, and then goes travelling all of a <b>sudden,</b> <b>we</b> {{know what it means}} if you don't." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{sat there}} silent {{and full of}} strange emotions, and expecting every moment the end to come.

60|$|We set sail, I say, from hence {{in seven}} days, and, finding the coast lie fairly on our {{starboard}} side, kept the land on board all the way, distance about three leagues; and it held us thus, {{about a hundred}} and twenty leagues due east, when on a <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> {{lost sight of the}} land; whether it broke off, or whether it only drew off farther south, we could not tell.|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither did we till lately. We've {{been reading}} Scott's novels, {{and all of}} a <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> remembered that our {{grandfather}} was a Scotchman. So we hunted up the old stories, got a bagpipe, put on our plaids, and went in, heart and soul, for the glory of the Clan. We've been at it some time now, and it's great fun.

60|$|The {{soldiers}} were moving {{on in the}} direction of the old Battery, and we were moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a <b>sudden,</b> <b>we</b> all stopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a long shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but it was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised together,--if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.|$|E
