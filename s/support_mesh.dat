40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{quantify}} {{the influence of}} elastic and non-elastic external <b>mesh</b> <b>support</b> on para-anastomotic hypercompliance in end-to-end anastomoses (ex vivo). MaterialsSix end-to-end anastomoses prepared from ovine carotid arteries without <b>mesh</b> <b>support</b> and with external elastic and non-elastic dacron <b>mesh</b> <b>support.</b> MethodsCompliance profiles of the anastomised arterial segments were measured successively, in the same anastomotic configuration without <b>mesh</b> <b>support,</b> with external elastic dacron <b>mesh</b> <b>support</b> and with external non-elastic dacron <b>mesh</b> <b>support</b> (randomized order). A pulsatile ex vivo perfusion system using a laser scan micrometer to monitor outer systolic and diastolic diameter was employed. ResultsMedian pre-anastomotic and post-anastomotic hypercompliance without external <b>mesh</b> <b>support</b> were 1. 45 and 1. 19 %/ 100 mmHg, respectively, above reference compliance. Use of the elastic <b>mesh</b> <b>support</b> significantly reduced the median hypercompliance to 0. 68 %/ 100 mmHg (pre-anastomotic) and to 0. 34 %/ 100 mmHg (post-anastomotic) above reference compliance. The non-elastic <b>mesh</b> <b>support</b> caused approximately the same significantly reduced median hypercompliance to 0. 53 %/ 100 mmHg (pre-anastomotic) and 0. 43 %/ 100 mmHg (post-anastomotic).

40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} treating micro-polluted surface water for drinking water production with a bio-diatomite dynamic membrane reactor (BDDMR) at lab-scale in continuous-flow mode. Results indicate that the BDDMR was effective in removing COD(Mn), DOC, UV(254), NH(3) -N and trihalomethanes' formation potential (THMFP) at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3. 5 h due to its high concentrations of {{mixed liquor suspended solids}} (MLSS) and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS). The removal of pollutants was mainly ascribed to microbial degradation in BDDMR because the dynamic membrane alone was much less effective in pollutant removal. Though the diatomite particles (5 - 20 mu m) were much smaller in size than the aperture of the stainless steel <b>support</b> <b>mesh</b> (74 mu m), microorganisms and their extracellular polymer substances could bind these particles tightly to form bio-diatomite particles which were completely retained by the <b>support</b> <b>mesh.</b> The analysis of molecular weight (MW) distribution by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) shows that the BDDMR could effectively remove the hydrophilic fraction of dissolved organic materials present in the raw water.

This paper discusses the reduction in energy consumption in the filtration process by using additive manufactured, geometrically optimised, conical, in-line filter supports. These are then compared with those currently fabricated by more conventional means. Based on computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations, a new filter support was designed and fabricated using Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology. The comparison was achieved by testing both types of filter supports of similar dimensions with filter mesh in a bespoke test rig at Croft Engineering Services. A 20 gauge, 900 µm filter mesh was used to test the two filter supports with flow rates between 0. 0018 m 3 /s to 0. 0062 m 3 /s. Comparison of the experimental results revealed that the AM filter <b>support</b> <b>mesh</b> arrangement was superior to the conventional filter <b>support</b> <b>mesh</b> arrangement. In comparison to the conventional approach, the AM filter support was 0. 443 kPa pressure drop lower when operated in the forward flow direction and 1. 852 kPa lower in reverse flow.

30|$|With the {{popularity}} of {{wireless local area network}} (LAN), increasing the network coverage is the necessary development. IEEE 802.11 s draft [1] divides nodes into two categories, including mesh node and non-mesh node. A mesh node can <b>support</b> <b>mesh</b> services, but non-mesh node cannot, e.g., the original IEEE 802.11 station (STA) is a non-mesh node [2]. Mesh nodes are divided into two categories: mesh point (MP), which only supports mesh services such as route selection and packet forwarding; mesh access point (MAP), which provides access point (AP) functions for STAs and mesh services. For compatibility with the IEEE 802.11 LAN, wireless mesh LAN must be able to link with other networks; therefore, a mesh point portal (MPP) provides the functions of layer 2 bridge and layer 3 interworking [3]. Wireless mesh LAN topology can be mainly divided into 802.11 connected mesh and 802.11  mesh ad hoc[4]. In IEEE 802.11 s draft, the medium access control (MAC) layer protocol has great influence for wireless mesh LAN performance [5, 6] and it follows the original IEEE 802.11 e enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) [7], including congestion control [8, 9], power saving [10], synchronization [11] and beacon collision avoidance [12], and quality of service (QoS) [13 – 15].|$|E
40|$|This study {{developed}} a biologically enhanced powder activated carbon (PAC) diatomite dynamic membrane reactor (BPDDMR) to pretreat micro-polluted surface water for drinking water production at lab-scale in continuous mode. In the start-up operation period, the BPDDMR required approximately 26 and 31 d to achieve stable removal efficiency of CODMn and NH 3 -N, respectively. Turbidity was always below 0. 5 NTU throughout the operation {{experiment in the}} permeate flux range of 21 - 54 l m(- 2) h(- 1). The BPDDMR could effectively remove the hydrophilic portion of dissolved organic materials (DOM) present in the raw water. The temperature affected pollutant removal (especially CODMn), which was mainly ascribed to microbial degradation and was also enhanced by PAC and diatomite adsorption. During the precoating period, the stainless steel <b>support</b> <b>mesh</b> (aperture 74 mu m) first intercepted the large PAC (50 - 100 mu m), and then diatomite particles (5 - 20 mu m) were intercepted to form a two-layer structure of the biologically enhanced PAC diatomite dynamic membrane (BPDDM).

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} designing space efficient solutions for representing the connectivity information of manifold triangle meshes. Most mesh data structures are quite redundant, storing {{a large amount of}} information in order to efficiently <b>support</b> <b>mesh</b> traversal operators. Several compact data structures have been proposed to reduce storage cost while supporting constant-time mesh traversal. Some recent solutions are based on a global re-ordering approach, which allows to implicitly encode a map between vertices and faces. Unfortunately, these compact representations do not support efficient updates, because local connectivity changes (such as edge-contractions, edge-flips or vertex insertions) require reordering the entire mesh. Our main contribution is to propose a new way of designing compact data structures which can be dynamically maintained. In our solution, we push further the limits of the re-ordering approaches: the main novelty is to allow to re-order vertex data (such as vertex coordinates), and to exploit this vertex permutation to easily maintain the connectivity under local changes. We describe a new class of data structures, called Editable SQuad (ESQ), offering the same navigational and storage performance as previous works, while supporting local editing in amortized constant time. As far as we know, our solution provides the most compact dynamic data structure for triangle meshes. We propose a linear-time and linear-space construction algorithm, and provide worst-case bounds for storage and time cost.

40|$|The {{finite element}} method (FEM) has been widely used for the {{structural}} modeling of physical systems. Due to computation-intensiveness and computation-locality, it is attractive to implement the {{finite element method}} on distributed memory multicomputers. Many research efforts have already provided solid algorithms for mesh partitioning and load balancing. However, without proper <b>support,</b> <b>mesh</b> partitioning and load balancing are labor intensive and tedious. In this paper, we present an unstructured mesh partitioner and load balancer (UMPAL) on World Wide Web (WWW). UMPAL is an integrated tool that consists of five components, a partitioner, a load balancer, a simulator, a visualization tool, and a Web interface. In the partitioner, three partitioning methods, Jostle/DDM, Metis/DDM, and Party/DDM are provided. The load balancer provides two load-balancing methods, prefix code matching parallel load-balancing and binomial tree based parallel load-balancing. The simulator provides a performance simulation environment for a partitioned mesh. By inputting parameters of a target distributed memory multicomputer, one can get the execution result of a partitioned mesh from the simulator. The visualization tool provides a way for users to view a partitioned mesh. The Web interface provides a mean for users to use UMPAL via the Internet and integrates the other four parts. Through the Web interface, other four components can be operated independently or together. Additionally, UMPAL provides several demonstrations and their corresponding mesh models that allow beginners to download and experiment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE External aortic root {{support is}} being {{evaluated}} {{as an alternative}} to total root replacement for Marfan syndrome. In this way cardiopulmonary bypass and Bentall operation can be prevented. The hypothesis that graft material becomes incorporated in the adventitia was tested in a comparative study in lambs. MATERIAL AND METHODS Graft material was wrapped around the carotid artery of six lambs. After a predefined 4 - 6 months implantation period the material was excised, histologically examined and stress tested. RESULTS We report on five lambs that grew from an average 16 Kg to 27 Kg, one animal died two weeks after implantation of pneumonia. Microscopy confirmed integrity of the vessel architecture within the sleeve. In one specimen there was mild oedema in the outer part of the media for less then 25 % of the circumference. Other findings were consistent in all animals. Fibrosis was found for at least 50 % of the adventitia. The lumen was normal but the vessel wall was significantly thickened. There was {{a significant increase in the}} maximum tensile strength of the supported segments (955 ± 372 N/cm 2) compared to normal arterial tissue (188 ± 23 N/cm 2). CONCLUSIONS Experimental limitations include the small numbers, necessary in a large animal experiment, but the findings were consistent and, we believe, representative of the biological response to external support. The external aortic root <b>support</b> <b>mesh</b> was well incorporated, the vessel wall was healthy, and its integrity preserved.

40|$|Autologous vein-graft failure {{significantly}} {{limits the}} long-term efficacy of {{coronary artery bypass}} procedures. The major cause behind this complication is biomechanical mismatch between the vein and coronary artery. The implanted vein experiences a sudden increase (10 - 12 fold) in luminal pressures. The resulting vein over-distension or 2 ̆ 7 ballooning 2 ̆ 7 initiates wall thickening phenomenon and ultimate occlusion. Therefore, a primary goal in improving the longevity of a coronary bypass procedure is to inhibit vein over-distension using mechanical constriction. The idea of using an external vein-graft <b>support</b> <b>mesh</b> has demonstrated sustained benefits and wide acceptance in experimental studies. Nitinol based knitted structures have offered more promising mechanical features than other mesh designs owing to their unique loosely looped construction. However, the conventional plain knit construction still exhibits limitations (radial compliance, deployment ease, flexibility, and bending stresses) which limit this design from proving its real clinical advantage. The new knitted mesh design presented {{in this study is}} based on the concept of composite knitting utilising high modulus (nitinol and polyester) and low modulus (polyurethane) material components. The experimental comparison of the new design with a plain knit design demonstrated significant improvement in biomechanical (compliance, flexibility, extensibility, viscoelasticity) and procedural (deployment limit) parameters. The results are indicative of the promising role of new mesh in restoring the lost compliance and pulsatility of vein-graft at high arterial pressures. This way it can assist in controlled vein-graft remodelling and stepwise restoration of vein mechanical homoeostasis. Also, improvement in deployment limit parameter offers more flexibility for a surgeon to use a wide range of vein diameters, which may otherwise be rendered unusable for a plain knit mesh...|$|E
