5|$|There were {{numerous}} reports in <b>southern</b> <b>Mississippi</b> of embedded tornadoes that exacerbated the hurricane's effects. Reports in Gulfport indicated that three schools actively {{being used as}} hurricane shelters were struck and damaged by tornadoes. At one location, almost 400 people being housed in a school had to rush to safety before part of its roof collapsed. Another apparent tornado sideswiped a senior citizens' center, endangering nearly 200 people in a structure that sustained damage to windows, doors, and part of its roof; about 20 people required rescue by paramedics. Only minor injuries occurred {{in association with the}} possible tornadoes. Teams of experts tasked with reviewing the validity of tornado reports were largely unable to prove that {{a significant portion of the}} damage in <b>southern</b> <b>Mississippi</b> had been done by tornadoes. As a result, few tornadoes were confirmed, and it is likely that most of the damage in the region resulted from squall-like winds that are part of an intense hurricane's nature, or potentially localized microbursts. Any unconfirmed tornadoes would have been no stronger than the hurricane's synoptic winds.|$|E

5|$|Upon making landfall, Waveland, Mississippi {{recorded}} a peak storm surge of 4.12feet (1.26m). Sustained winds there peaked at 31mph (50km/h), and a peak gust of 41mph (66km/h). Tropical Storm Bertha produced moderate to heavy precipitation across <b>southern</b> <b>Mississippi,</b> including {{a total of}} 10.25inches (260.35mm) in Pascagoula.

5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the disaster, President George W.

5|$|As {{the storm}} system moved eastward toward the Ohio, Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys on April 27, a very {{powerful}} 80–100 knot mid-level jet stream moved into the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, behind the trough, creating strong wind shear, with a low pressure center moving quickly northeastward across those areas on the 27th. On the afternoon of April 27, CAPE values were estimated {{to be in the}} range of 2000–3000 J/kg across Louisiana and <b>southern</b> <b>Mississippi,</b> with the moderate instability moving northeastward across the southern Tennessee Valley; in addition, temperatures across the southeastern United States ranged from the 70s°F (mid-20s°C) to the lower 90s°F (near 35°C). Helicity levels ranged from 450–600 m2/s2, which were supportive for significant tornadic activity and strong to violent long-track tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|By September29, Georges had {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} storm and completed a small clockwise loop over <b>southern</b> <b>Mississippi.</b> Subsequently, the storm began tracking west-northwestward at a faster pace. Around 1200UTC, Georges weakened to a tropical depression, and the NHC issued their final advisory on the system. At this time, the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) initiated public advisories. The depression maintained a well-defined circulation as it tracked close to the Gulf of Mexico; however, the center of circulation remained inland. Large quantities of tropical moisture fed the storm, allowing it to produce torrential rainfall. By September30, the low-level circulation began to detach from the upper-level circulation. The HPC issued their final advisory on the depression early on October1 as it neared the Atlantic Ocean, and it fully dissipated several hours later.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} 1958, the {{subspecies}} {{were thought to}} have evolved in response to geographic isolation during the last ice age, 100,000 to 11,000years ago. At that time painted turtles were divided into three different populations: eastern painted turtles along the southeastern Atlantic coast; southern painted turtles around the <b>southern</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River; and western painted turtles in the southwestern United States. The populations were not completely isolated for sufficiently long, hence wholly different species never evolved. When the glaciers retreated, about 11,000years ago, all three subspecies moved north. The western and southern subspecies met in Missouri and hybridized to produce the midland painted turtle, which then moved east and north through the Ohio and Tennessee river basins.|$|E
