5000|$|In a [...] forced (also called pressurized) {{lubrication}} system, lubrication {{is accomplished}} {{in a closed}} loop which carries motor oil to the surfaces serviced by the system and then returns the oil to a reservoir. The auxiliary equipment of an engine is typically not serviced by this loop; for instance, an alternator may use ball bearings sealed with their own lubricant. The reservoir for the oil is usually the sump, and when this is the case, it is called a wet <b>sump</b> <b>system.</b> When there is a different oil reservoir the crankcase still catches it, but it is continuously drained by a dedicated pump; {{this is called a}} dry <b>sump</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Oil {{circulation}} is kept {{separate from}} the fuel/air mixture, thereby preserving oil rather than burning it as happens in two-stroke engines. Oil moves from its reservoir, is pressurized by an oil pump, and is pumped through the oil filter to remove grit. The oil is then squirted into the crankshaft and connecting rod bearings and onto the cylinder walls, and eventually drips off {{into the bottom of}} the crankcase. [...] In a wet <b>sump</b> <b>system,</b> oil remains in a reservoir at the bottom of the crankcase, referred to as the oil pan. In a dry <b>sump</b> <b>system,</b> oil is instead pumped to an external reservoir.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{losses are}} of great {{significance}} to the automotive and motorsports industries. Many of these losses are incurred during power transmission through the gearbox. There has been considerable research in this area, however, generally gear losses are not calculated at part load condition, nor are so called dry <b>sump</b> <b>systems</b> considered outside of motor racing. The method developed by Anderson & Loewenthal which considers efficiency over part-load conditions is used here to calculate geartrain losses with varying speed, load and temperature conditions in a spur gear type gearbox for motorsport application. Both oil bath (wet sump) and oil jet (dry <b>sump)</b> <b>systems</b> of lubrications are considered. The Changenet method {{is used to calculate}} the churning losses in the typical oil bath lubrication system. Seventeen different mineral and synthetic oils were evaluated. At 75 kW engine output, 1200 W were lost in the dry sump gearbox whereas 1320 W were lost in the wet-sump gearbox – in 1 st gear at 9000 rpm engine speed. The oils studied showed a spread of total drive efficiency of 97. 8 to 99 % in the most extreme temperature case. Observation of how efficiency and film thickness relate to operating temperatures it is clear that tight temperature control is critical to obtain the potential benefits available from oil optimisation. The dry sump gearbox is predicted to be more efficient only above 5000 rpm engine speed...|$|R
50|$|Small {{two-stroke}} engines, as for motorcycles and lawnmowers, use crankcase compression: {{the fuel}} mixture {{passes through the}} sump space in the crankcase. This precludes the use of both wet sump and dry <b>sump</b> <b>systems,</b> as excess oil here would contaminate the mixture, leading to excess oil being burned in the engine and so excessive hydrocarbon emissions. These engines are instead lubricated by petroil mixtures, where a carefully measured proportion of oil {{is added to the}} fuel tank (between 1:16 and 1:50 ratios). This oil is consumed immediately and entirely, so {{there is no need for}} a sump to collect and re-use it.|$|R

5000|$|Even in a wet <b>sump</b> <b>system,</b> the {{crankshaft}} has minimal {{contact with}} the sump oil.
