5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in <b>staining</b> fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium <b>staining</b> greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and <b>staining</b> action.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{contrast}} and {{differential interference contrast}} (DIC) microscopy are important tools in biology and medicine. Most animal cells and single-celled organisms have very little color, and their intracellular organelles are almost totally invisible under simple bright field illumination. These structures can be made visible by <b>staining</b> the specimens, but <b>staining</b> procedures are time-consuming and kill the cells. As seen in Figs.24 and25, phase {{contrast and}} DIC microscopes allow unstained, living cells to be studied. DIC also has non-biological applications, for example {{in the analysis of}} planar silicon semiconductor processing.|$|E

5000|$|Use of sample-staining {{methods for}} use in microbiology, such as simple <b>stains</b> (methylene blue, safranin, crystal violet) and {{differential}} <b>stains</b> (negative <b>stains,</b> flagellar <b>stains,</b> endospore <b>stains).</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are special}} {{consideration}} when cleaning <b>stained</b> wood. One {{of the most}} common <b>stains</b> is water <b>stains</b> on <b>stained</b> wood. Techniques to remove the water <b>stains</b> have been documented that use a hot iron to remove the water <b>stain.</b>|$|R
5|$|A new form, Lactarius repraesentaneus f. immutabilis, was {{described}} from Le Sappey, in the Haute-Savoie department of southeastern France in 2011. It differs in the <b>staining</b> reaction of its injured flesh.|$|E
5|$|A specific, {{recognizable}} {{feature of}} Purkinje neurons is {{the expression of}} calbindin. Calbindin <b>staining</b> of rat brain after unilateral chronic sciatic nerve injury suggests that Purkinje neurons may be newly generated in the adult brain, initiating the organization of new cerebellar lobules.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{began to}} quickly develop and grow with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's {{dramatic}} {{improvement of the}} microscope. It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and <b>staining.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Romanowsky <b>stains</b> are {{all based}} on a {{combination}} of eosinate (chemically reduced eosin) and methylene blue (sometimes with its oxidation products azure A and azure B). Common variants include Wright's <b>stain,</b> Jenner's <b>stain,</b> May-Grunwald <b>stain,</b> Leishman <b>stain</b> and Giemsa <b>stain.</b>|$|R

50|$|Mycobacteria are {{classical}} acid-fast organisms. <b>Stains</b> used in {{evaluation of}} tissue specimens or microbiological specimens include Fites <b>stain,</b> Ziehl-Neelsen <b>stain,</b> and Kinyoun <b>stain.</b>|$|R
5|$|Cell theory led {{biologists}} to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages {{of individual}} cells. Scientists in the rising field of cytology, armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new <b>staining</b> methods, soon {{found that even}} single cells were far {{more complex than the}} homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. Robert Brown had described the nucleus in 1831, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: chromosomes, centrosomes mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other structures made visible through <b>staining.</b> Between 1874 and 1884 Walther Flemming described the discrete stages of mitosis, showing that they were not artifacts of <b>staining</b> but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a daughter cell was produced. Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in August Weismann's theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between somatic cells and germ cells (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of meiosis), and adopted Hugo de Vries's theory of pangenes. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental embryology.|$|E
5|$|E. coli stains Gram-negative {{because its}} cell wall is {{composed}} of a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane. During the <b>staining</b> process, E. coli picks up {{the color of the}} counterstain safranin and stains pink. The outer membrane surrounding the cell wall provides a barrier to certain antibiotics such that E. coli is not damaged by penicillin.|$|E
5|$|Niche uses {{of heavy}} metals with high atomic numbers occur in {{diagnostic}} imaging, electron microscopy, and nuclear science. In diagnostic imaging, heavy metals such as cobalt or tungsten {{make up the}} anode materials found in x-ray tubes. In electron microscopy, heavy metals such as lead, gold, palladium, platinum, or uranium are used to make conductive coatings and to introduce electron density into biological specimens by <b>staining,</b> negative <b>staining,</b> or vacuum deposition. In nuclear science, nuclei of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, or zinc are sometimes fired at other heavy metal targets to produce superheavy elements; heavy metals are also employed as spallation targets {{for the production of}} neutrons or radioisotopes such as astatine (using lead, bismuth, thorium, or uranium in the latter case).|$|E
50|$|Interestingly PepMoV {{makes two}} types of {{inclusions}} in infected cells, the typical cylindrical inclusions (CI) and an amorphous inclusion (AI). Thus leaf strips <b>stained</b> with the protein <b>stain,</b> OG, and the nucleic acid <b>stain,</b> AA, {{can be used to}} identify this virus in pepper. The CI only <b>stains</b> in OG while the AI <b>stains</b> in both <b>stains.</b>|$|R

5|$|Palmer {{publishes a}} study which finds no {{bacteria}} in the human stomach. He concludes earlier discoveries were a result of contamination. Unfortunately, he chooses not to use a silver <b>staining</b> method, which will be later used to reveal H. pylori by Warren and Marshall.|$|E
5|$|The paper {{used for}} the Grolier Codex appears to be {{authentic}} pre-Columbian bark paper dating from the 13th century. A number of non-destructive techniques have been applied to the codex {{in an effort to}} authenticate it, and the results were published in 2008. The analysis revealed that only pre-Columbian materials had been used in its creation; no modern inorganic materials were detected. Some inconsistencies were revealed however; cuts along the page edges seem to have been made with a sharp blade in order to give the appearance of natural wear and tear and the supposed water <b>staining</b> did not permeate the paper. The researchers commented that the <b>staining</b> appeared {{to be the result of}} drops of dye or ink being applied to the surface of the codex. In conclusion the researchers were unable to support or refute the pre-Columbian nature of the codex. Unusually for a document that supposedly was stored in a cave for centuries, the paint of the codex still appears fresh.|$|E
50|$|There can be {{intentional}} <b>stains</b> (such as wood <b>stains</b> or paint), indicative <b>stains</b> (such as {{food coloring}} or adding a substance to make bacteria visible under a microscope), natural <b>stains</b> (such as rust on iron or a patina on bronze), and accidental <b>stains</b> such as ketchup on a shirt.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>stains</b> {{are removed}} by {{dissolving}} {{them with a}} solvent. The solvent to use is dependent on two factors: the agent that is causing the <b>stain,</b> and the material that has been <b>stained.</b> Different solvents will dissolve different <b>stains,</b> {{and the application of}} some solvents is limited {{by the fact that they}} not only dissolve the <b>stain,</b> but also dissolve the material that is <b>stained</b> as well.|$|R
5000|$|Hematoxylin and eosin <b>stain</b> or {{haematoxylin}} and eosin <b>stain</b> (H&E <b>stain</b> or HE <b>stain)</b> {{is one of}} {{the principal}} <b>stains</b> in histology. It is the most widely used <b>stain</b> in medical diagnosis and is often the gold standard; for example when a pathologist looks at a biopsy of a suspected cancer, the histological section is likely to be <b>stained</b> with H&E and termed [...] "H&E section", [...] "H+E section", or [...] "HE section". A combination of hematoxylin and eosin, it produces blues, violets, and reds.|$|R
5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas {{may vary}} from {{undifferentiated}} to well-differentiated. They are often {{surrounded by a}} brisk fibrotic or desmoplastic tissue response; {{in the presence of}} extensive fibrosis, {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish well-differentiated cholangiocarcinoma from normal reactive epithelium. There is no entirely specific immunohistochemical stain that can distinguish malignant from benign biliary ductal tissue, although <b>staining</b> for cytokeratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, and mucins may aid in diagnosis. Most tumors (>90%) are adenocarcinomas.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} of the North American species Chalciporus piperatoides are similar, but can be {{distinguished}} by its flesh and pores <b>staining</b> blue after cutting or bruising. It has a less peppery taste. Another mild-tasting relative, C.rubinellus, has brighter colours than C.piperatus, including completely red tubes. One European species, C.rubinus, has a shape similar to C.piperatus, but has red pores and a stem covered in red dots.|$|E

50|$|Various laundry {{techniques}} {{exist to}} attempt to remove or minimize existing <b>stains,</b> and <b>stain</b> removers are an important type of chemical in laundry detergents. Some stand-alone <b>stain</b> removers also exist. If the wrong technique is used to remove the <b>stain</b> or <b>stain</b> mark on the clothing it could actually cause permanent damage to the clothing.|$|R
50|$|Giemsa <b>stain</b> {{is also a}} {{differential}} <b>stain,</b> such as when it {{is combined}} with Wright <b>stain</b> to form Wright-Giemsa <b>stain.</b> It {{can be used to}} study the adherence of pathogenic bacteria to human cells. It differentially <b>stains</b> human and bacterial cells purple and pink respectively. It can be used for histopathological diagnosis of malaria and some other spirochete and protozoan blood parasites. It is also used in Wolbachia cell <b>stain</b> in Drosophila melanogaster.|$|R
25|$|Dispersion <b>staining</b> is {{an optical}} {{technique}} {{that results in}} a colored image of a colorless object. This is an optical <b>staining</b> technique and requires no stains or dyes to produce a color effect. There are five different microscope configurations used in the broader technique of dispersion <b>staining.</b> They include brightfield Becke line, oblique, darkfield, phase contrast, and objective stop dispersion <b>staining.</b>|$|E
25|$|Immunofluorescence (IF) on ethanol-fixed {{neutrophils}} is used {{to detect}} ANCA, although formalin-fixed neutrophils {{may be used to}} help differentiate ANCA patterns. ANCA can be divided into four patterns when visualised by IF; cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA), C-ANCA (atypical), perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA) and atypical ANCA (a-ANCA), also known as x-ANCA. c-ANCA shows cytoplasmic granular fluorescence with central interlobular accentuation. c-ANCA (atypical) shows cytoplasmic <b>staining</b> that is usually uniform and has no interlobular accentuation. p-ANCA has three subtypes, classical p-ANCA, p-ANCA without nuclear extension and granulocyte specific-antinuclear antibody (GS-ANA). Classical p-ANCA shows perinuclear <b>staining</b> with nuclear extension, p-ANCA without nuclear extension has perinuclear <b>staining</b> without nuclear extension and GS-ANA shows nuclear <b>staining</b> on granulocytes only. a-ANCA often shows combinations of both cytoplasmic and perinuclear <b>staining.</b>|$|E
25|$|Silver <b>staining</b> is {{used when}} more {{sensitive}} {{method for detection}} is needed, as classical Coomassie Brilliant Blue <b>staining</b> can usually detect a 50ng protein band, Silver <b>staining</b> increases the sensitivity typically 10-100 fold more. This {{is based on the}} chemistry of photographic development. The proteins are fixed to the gel with a dilute methanol solution, then incubated with an acidic silver nitrate solution. Silver ions are reduced to their metallic form by formaldehyde at alkaline pH. An acidic solution, such as acetic acid stops development. Silver <b>staining</b> was introduced by Kerenyi and Gallyas as a sensitive procedure to detect trace amounts of proteins in gels. The technique has been extended to the study of other biological macromolecules that have been separated in a variety of supports. Many variables can influence the colour intensity and every protein has its own <b>staining</b> characteristics; clean glassware, pure reagents and water of highest purity are the key points to successful <b>staining.</b> Silver <b>staining</b> was developed in the 14th century for colouring the surface of glass. It has been used extensively for this purpose since the 16th century. The colour produced by the early silver stains ranged between light yellow and an orange-red. Camillo Golgi perfected the silver <b>staining</b> {{for the study of the}} nervous system. Golgi's method stains a limited number of cells at random in their entirety.|$|E
