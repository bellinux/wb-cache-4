25|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>laser</b> {{sintering}} is an additive {{rapid manufacturing}} technique {{that uses a}} high power laser to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass representing a desired 3-dimensional object. The laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning cross-sections generated from a 3-D digital description of the part {{on the surface of}} a powder bed. <b>Selective</b> <b>laser</b> sintering was invented and patented by Dr. Carl Deckard at the University of Texas at Austin in 1989.|$|E
25|$|Many, perhaps most, {{threaded}} parts {{have potential}} to be generated via additive manufacturing (3D printing), {{of which there are}} many variants, including fused deposition modeling, <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> sintering, direct metal laser sintering, <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> melting, electron beam melting, layered object manufacturing, and stereolithography. For most additive technologies, it has not been long since they emerged from the laboratory end of their historical development, but further commercialization is picking up speed. To date, most additive methods tend to produce a rough surface finish and tend to be restricted in the material properties that they can produce, and thus their earliest commercial victories have been in parts for which those restrictions were acceptable. However, the capabilities are continually growing.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLasers as {{production}} tools offer several advantages, {{which are}} especially relevant {{for the production}} of solar cells. The contactless and localized nature of the energy deposition allows new processes, such as <b>laser</b> <b>selective</b> emitter doping, <b>laser</b> ablation of dielectric coatings and via drilling for back contact cell concepts. A critical factor is the selection of suitable laser sources and parameters in a manner that adapts the laser process to the requirements of the material, the process nature and the solar cell properties. In this paper three laser processes are investigated with the goal to identify the most suitable laser source...|$|R

25|$|AM {{processes}} for metal sintering or melting (such as <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> sintering, direct metal laser sintering, and <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> melting) usually went {{by their own}} individual names in the 1980s and 1990s. At the time, all metalworking was done by processes that we now call non-additive (casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining); although plenty of automation was applied to those technologies (such as by robot welding and CNC), {{the idea of a}} tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal (rather than adding it), such as CNC milling, CNC EDM, and many others. But the automated techniques that added metal, which would later be called additive manufacturing, were beginning to challenge that assumption. By the mid-1990s, new techniques for material deposition were developed at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, including microcasting and sprayed materials. Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common, enabling new object geometries.|$|E

Studies show SLT is {{as effective as}} ALT at lowering eye pressure. In addition, SLT may be repeated three to four times, whereas ALT can usually be repeated only once.|$|E

40|$|Ceramic {{materials}} present joining {{and repair}} difficulties that metallic and polymeric materials often lack. The high working temperature and potential for thermal decomposition make {{techniques such as}} welding and adhesive bonding unfeasible or impractical. It is possible to create ceramic materials from gas phase precursors {{through the use of}} chemical vapor deposition methods. A laser can create localized heat in a substrate and cause the productive decomposition where spatially desired. Through computer motion control, arbitrary patterns of ceramic deposits can be grown. This technique {{can be used to make}} free form objects. This process is known as <b>selective</b> area <b>laser</b> deposition (SALD). A similar process of <b>selective</b> area <b>laser</b> deposition and vapor infiltration (SALDVI) uses a powder bed to create more uniform depositions. Through the use of these techniques, while defining the negative space of a joint as the envelope for a three dimensional deposit, it is possible to form a joint fill. The process can be used to create a variety of ceramic compositions by manipulating the precursor gas combinations. The design of a deposition-joining system is presented. The system is operated as a proof of concept to create, silicon carbide, silicon nitride and aluminum oxide deposits and joints. These different systems are characterized to show the potential for this technology...|$|R

The micro-lattice plate can be manufactured using the <b>selective</b> metal <b>laser</b> melting technique, and various shapes of its micro-architecture can be easily produced even if there are non-uniform cells. In particular, effects of boundary condition of the plate's edges, cell's geometry and the shapes of non-uniform region on the initial stiffness and plastic collapse strength are investigated. Also, based on the numerical results, empirical equations for estimating these mechanical properties are proposed...|$|R
2500|$|Nd:YAG lasers {{are used}} in {{manufacturing}} for engraving, etching, or marking a variety of metals and plastics, or for metal surface enhancement processes like laser peening. They are extensively used in manufacturing for cutting and welding steel, semiconductors and various alloys. For automotive applications (cutting and welding steel) the power levels are typically 1–5kW. [...] Super alloy drilling (for gas turbine parts) typically uses pulsed Nd:YAG lasers (millisecond pulses, not Q-switched). Nd:YAG lasers are also employed to make subsurface markings in transparent materials such as glass or acrylic glass. [...] Lasers of up to 2kW are used for <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> melting of metals in additive layered manufacturing. In aerospace applications, {{they can be used}} to drill cooling holes for enhanced air flow/heat exhaust efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include <b>selective</b> <b>laser</b> sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. <b>Selective</b> <b>laser</b> melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to <b>Selective</b> <b>Laser</b> Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method for}} bonding micro optical {{components}} {{using a new}} joining process of silicon with glass is described.

In order to characterize the locally <b>selective</b> bonding with <b>laser</b> (SBL) process, variations of laser parameters have been correlated with temperature measurements during bonding and the achieved bonding results.

The result of the investigations was a parameter field producing reproducible and strong silicon glass bonds.

Finally advantages and disadvantages of SBL with silicon and glass are discussed with respect to micro assembly of optical parts for telecommunication components...|$|R

Study Design/Materials and Methods Ten subjects with 13 biopsy-proven BCCs received four combined PDL and Nd:YAG at treatments 2 – 4 week intervals. None of the BCCs met the criteria for Mohs micrographic surgery. The tumor and 4 [*]mm of peripheral skin were treated using standardized parameters delivered with a 7 [*]mm spot with 10 % overlap. The treated area was excised and evaluated histologically for residual tumor. The primary study endpoint was histologic clearance of tumor. The secondary study endpoint was blinded investigator assessment of clinical endpoint and adverse effects. Results Approximately half of all tumors showed a complete response to four combined PDL and Nd:YAG treatments (n[*]=[*] 7 / 12, 58 %). When stratified by size, 75 % of all tumors < 1 [*]cm in diameter (n[*]=[*] 6 / 8) showed complete response. Tumor histologic types among the complete responders included superficial and nodular BCCs. All subjects with incompletely responding BCCs were on various forms of anticoagulation, which we hypothesize, may inhibit laser-mediated thrombosis necessary for the clinical effect. Blinded investigator assessment suggests that biopsy related erythema improves with subsequent laser treatments. Conclusions Combined PDL and Nd:YAG laser is an effective means of reducing tumor burden in patients with BCC and may be a promising, emerging alternative therapy. Factors influencing treatment response includes the concomitant use of anticoagulation. Further studies are needed to investigate and optimize the utility of this treatment protocol. Lasers Surg.
