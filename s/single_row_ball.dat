40|$|The Large-scale Advanced Prop-fan (LAP) hub {{assembly}} forms a semi-rigid {{link between the}} blades, which provide the thrust, and the engine shaft, which provides the torque. The hub and tailshaft is a one piece partially forged part which is carburized, heat treated and machined. A <b>single</b> <b>row</b> <b>ball</b> bearing restrains {{each of the eight}} blades in the hub, while the tailshaft secures the propeller to the engine shaft with two cone seats that are preloaded against each other by the Prop-fan retaining nut. The hub also forms the support for the pitch change actuator system, the control and the spinner. The retention transmits the loads from the blades to the hub while allowing the changes in blade pitch. The <b>single</b> <b>row</b> <b>ball</b> bearing retention provides ease of maintenance by allowing individual blade replacement without dissassembly of the hub. It has a through hardened inner race which seats against the aluminum blade shank and an outer race which is integral with the barrel. The outer race area is carburized to achieve the hardness necessary to support the ball loads. The balls are kept from contact with each other by a separator. The rotational speed of the propeller keeps the retention submerged in the oil which is contained in the hub by a seal. Stress and strain analysis, material hardness requirements, weight predictions, and stiffness characteristics are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The article {{presents}} selected {{issues associated with}} the use of adhesive joints in the assembly of ball bearings in the gearbox housing. The aim of the study was the comparative analysis of adhesive joints strength of gear bearing housings. One series of rings, simulating the new socket fits with different parameters and different degrees of wear were used to comparison of these joints. The tests were conducted on two series of rings, to represent new housing of different fit parameters and wear variants. The three types of tested adhesives are frequently found in similar applications. The rings and two types of bearings were tested: <b>single</b> <b>row</b> <b>ball</b> bearings 6207 Z and tapered roller bearings 30207 A. The comparative analysis of tested adhesives indicates the superiority of Loctite products over Chester Molecular B 36 adhesive. In tapered roller bearings Loctite 542 produced the strongest bond...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{a dynamic}} multibody {{model of a}} deep groove <b>single</b> <b>row</b> <b>ball</b> bearing. The objective {{of the study is}} to simulate the dynamic behavior of a bearing under different operational conditions. Typical vibration signals used in bearing diagnostics are simulated using the non-linear Hertzian contact theory. Geometry, material properties, friction and damping coefficients are considered as input while displacements, velocities, accelerations and forces between bearing rings are calculated and validated with the analytical formulations found in literature. Furthermore localized faults are introduced in the simulation in order to extract bearing defect frequencies and to represent the real vibration signal signature in case of fault components. For this purpose, a simplified model is realized using the polygonal contact model. This approach allows to investigate more in detail the effect of localized defects by reproducing the real rolling elements trajectories through a discretization of the contact surfaces. The low computation efficiency compared to the traditional Hertzian approach limits the application of this contact algorithm on the complete bearing model. Nevertheless, the simplified model allows to draw conclusions regarding the influence of the shaft/cage speed on the fault size estimation giving an innovative contribution on bearing diagnostics. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the investigation of}} bearing failure in a compressor test rig which has been satisfactorily in operation. Two pair of <b>single</b> <b>row</b> angular contact <b>ball</b> bearings, each pair in tandem, and the pairs in turn in back to back support the rotor shaft to meet compressor thrust and to provide moderate stiffness for smooth operation. Since being experimental rig, it is reassembled several times involving bearing replacements on each occasion. Recently one bearing on one side pair is found severely damaged and the other bearing of the pair with minor damage. The bearing with minor damage supported the rotor and this evaded the initial diagnostics until the time of severe damage. Initial investigation revealed that {{the primary cause of}} failure is washed off by the secondary failure. A thorough, systematic investigation with the help of fishbone approach is carried in order to find out the root cause of the failure and also to decide on new rig. This investigation revealed lack of preload as the major cause and bearing seat clearance as minor problem. New procedure is adopted to ensure proper preload and the rig is back in operation...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} a {{completely}} new approach to the classical <b>single</b> <b>row</b> routing problem. The approach {{is based on a}} graph theoretic representation, in which an instance of the <b>single</b> <b>row</b> routing problem is represented by three graphs, an overlap graph, a containment graph and an interval graph. Three decomposition schemes for a <b>single</b> <b>row</b> routing problem are developed, based on connectivity properties of these graphs. We also investigate the conditions under which optimal composition is possible. For several special classes of the <b>single</b> <b>row</b> routing problem optimal algorithms are developed. These results lead to an efficient heuristic for solving the <b>single</b> <b>row</b> routing problem. In addition, we investigate neccessary and sufficient conditions for a layout with bounded number of doglegs per net. ^ Our approach is significantly different from all previous approaches {{in the sense that it}} is based entirely on the graph-theoretic properties of the routing configuration and does not involve layout explicitly. The approach also leads to many interesting theoretical insights into the <b>single</b> <b>row</b> routing problem. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between double rows 15 cm apart on 76 cm centers and <b>single</b> <b>rows</b> 76 cm apart of 'Oregon 91 G' bush green beans {{at the same}} planting densities in three experiments in 1986 and 1987. There was {{a significant increase in}} yields of pods from double rows of 9 - 14 percent compared to <b>single</b> <b>rows</b> in two experiments. From the third experiment with low planting densities double rows gave an increase in pod yield of 3 percent, which was not significant. Individual plant dry weights and Leaf Area Index (LAI) were usually higher for plants in double rows compared to plants in <b>single</b> <b>rows.</b> Yield responses from increasing plant density were not consistent but highest yields were produced at densities of 35 - 50 plants/m². Plant dry weights decreased as density increased, while effects of density on LAI were not consistent. Planting of bush beans in double <b>rows</b> compared to <b>single</b> <b>rows</b> should result in no additional cost inputs except development of planters. Feasibility of adoption of this system of planting is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} determine the best land and water management by arrangement of plant spacing, irrigation, and drainage of rubber plantation in order to improve rubber plantation productivity. This research was done using The WaNuLCAS (Water, Nutrient and Light Capture in Agroforestry System) model {{to determine the}} best land and water management under several scenario combinations of two factors. The first factor was rubber plant spacing arrangement system, which consisted of three levels, i. e. <b>single</b> <b>row</b> (3 x 7 m), <b>single</b> <b>row</b> (3 x 6 m) and double row (2 x 6 x 14 m). The second factor was water management treatment, which consisted of four levels, i. e. without irrigation and drainage, irrigation in dry season, drainage in wet season, and irrigation and drainage in dry and wet season respectively. The results showed that drainage treatment could enhance rubber plantation productivity. Moreover, rubber plantations which were using <b>single</b> <b>row</b> (3 x 7 m), <b>single</b> <b>row</b> (3 x 6 m) and double row (2 x 6 x 14 m) had no significant difference on latex production per hectare...|$|R
