5|$|The {{electrostatic}} design does {{away with}} two major weaknesses of boxed speakers: enclosure colourations and <b>signal</b> <b>degradation</b> {{due to the}} crossover. The crossover in the ESL consists merely of resistors which work with the inherent capacitance of the speaker elements to obtain a first-order response. Because it is bipolar, {{both sides of the}} elements are not enclosed, but radiate directly into the air. Thus, colourations due to crossover components and box-induced reflections are minimised.|$|E

Low-loss materials are more expensive. Choosing unnecessarily low-loss material is a common error in high-frequency digital design; it increases the cost of the boards without a corresponding benefit. <b>Signal</b> <b>degradation</b> by loss tangent and dielectric constant can be easily assessed by an eye pattern.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} {{frequencies}} at which birds call {{in an environment}} varies {{with the quality of}} habitat and the ambient sounds. The acoustic adaptation hypothesis predicts that narrow bandwidths, low frequencies, and long elements and inter-element intervals should be found in habitats with complex vegetation structures (which would absorb and muffle sounds), while high frequencies, broad bandwidth, high-frequency modulations (trills), and short elements and inter-elements may be expected in open habitats, without obstructive vegetation. Low frequency songs are optimal for obstructed, densely vegetated habitats because low frequency, slowly modulated song elements are less susceptible to <b>signal</b> <b>degradation</b> by means of reverberations off of sound-reflecting vegetation. High frequency calls with rapid modulations are optimal for open habitats because they degrade less across open space. The acoustic adaptation hypothesis also states that song characteristics may take advantage of beneficial acoustic properties of the environment. Narrow-frequency bandwidth notes are increased in volume and length by reverberations in densely vegetated habitats.|$|E

It is shown that a previously proposed algorithm which trades off between the expected number of handoffs and the expected number of <b>signal</b> <b>degradations</b> suffers from excessive handoff delay. Therefore, the optimal tradeoff between handoff delay and number of handoffs is investigated.

40|$|Failure of many {{engineering}} systems usually {{results from}} a gradual and irreversible accumulation of damage, a degradation process. Most degradation processes can be monitored using sensor technology. The resulting <b>degradation</b> <b>signals</b> are usually correlated with the degradation process. A system is considered to have failed once its <b>degradation</b> <b>signal</b> reaches a prespecified failure threshold. This paper considers a replacement problem for components whose degradation process can be monitored using dedicated sensors. First, we present a stochastic degradation modeling framework that characterizes, in real time, {{the path of a}} component's <b>degradation</b> <b>signal.</b> These signals are used to predict the evolution of the component's degradation state. Next, we formulate a single-unit replacement problem as a Markov decision process and utilize the real-time signal observations to determine a replacement policy. We focus on exponentially increasing <b>degradation</b> <b>signals</b> and show that the optimal replacement policy for this class of problems is a monotonically nondecreasing control limit policy.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Degradation</b> <b>signals</b> are sensor-based {{signals that}} are {{correlated}} with degradation processes of engineering components. In this paper, {{we present a}} flexible modeling framework for characterizing <b>degradation</b> <b>signals</b> {{that can only be}} observed up to a prespecified failure threshold. The underlying assumption of this framework is that the engineering components degrade according to a similar trend, referred to as the common shape function, but at different degradation rates. Under this assumption, the <b>degradation</b> <b>signals</b> of different components are synchronized using a random time warping process, which transforms the common trend function into degradation processes that progress at varying rates. Our primary objective is to obtain real-time predictions for the residual lifetime of components deployed in the field. In the initial step, the historical <b>degradation</b> <b>signals</b> are used to recover the distribution of the degradation processes under the assumptions of the proposed time warping model. Next, the distribution of the degradation process is updated using the signal(s) of partially degraded component(s). The updated model is then utilized to predict the residual lifetime distributions of these components. We test the performance of our methodology using vibration-based <b>degradation</b> <b>signals</b> from a rotating machinery experimen...|$|R
