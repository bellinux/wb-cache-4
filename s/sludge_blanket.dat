40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model is presented and applied {{in the design of}} the secondary settling tanks of Psyttalia Wastewater Treatment Plant in Athens, Europe's largest sewage treatment facility. The tanks are of the Gould Type II consisting of the following regions: an inlet-flocculation chamber with an inlet baffle, two zones of settling separated by an intermediate baffle, an outlet region, and a sludge collection region. The number of tanks and their dimensions were determined with an empirical design procedure. Then, theoretical considerations, information from similar existing tanks, and preliminary CFD calculations were combined to determine the dimensions of the main regions and the positions of the baffles. Finally, detailed CFD calculations were performed to examine the performance of the tanks for various design conditions. Computations showed that the flow in the inlet-flocculation region was completely mixed; while in the settling regions a ""three-layer"" structure with relatively constant layer heights was observed. CFD results were processed to determine parameters of practical interest, including the heights of the <b>sludge</b> <b>blankets</b> and the effluent suspended solids concentrations; these parameters were correlated satisfactorily with the Hazen number, which is used as a scaling parameter in primary settling tanks. © 2009 ASCE...|$|R

40|$|This review {{presents}} an overview with {{critical analysis of}} the technical applicability of biological treatments for landfill leachate. A particular focus is given to activated sludge (AS), sequencing batch reactors (SBR), aerated lagoons (AL), and upflow anaerobic <b>sludge</b> <b>blankets</b> (UASB). Their advantages and limitations in application are evaluated. Selected information is presented such as pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT), organic loading rate (OLR), characteristics of leachate and treatment performance. It {{is evident from the}} literature survey of 188 papers (1976 - 2010) that none of the individual biological treatments presented is universally applicable for removing recalcitrant contaminants from leachate. Among the biological treatments reviewed, AS, SBR and UASB are the most frequently applied. These treatments are effective not only to remove over 90 % of COD with a concentration ranging from 3500 - 26000 mg L - 1, but also to achieve 80 % of NH 3 -N removal with a concentration ranging from 100 - 1000 mg L - 1. A combination of physico-chemical and biological treatment into an integrated process is effective for leachate treatment. Almost complete removal of COD and NH 3 -N was reported for combined reverse osmosis (RO) and UASB with an initial COD concentration of 35000 mg L - 1 and NH 3 -N concentration of 1600 mg L - 1. Integrated Fenton's oxidation and AS could achieve about 98 % and 99 % of COD and NH 3 -N removal, respectively, with initial COD and NH 3 -N concentrations of 7000 mg L - 1 and 1800 mg L - 1. Overall, the selection of the most suitable treatment for leachate depends on its characteristics, technical applicability and potential constraints, effluent limit required, cost-effectiveness, regulatory requirements and long-term environmental impacts.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} to fill knowledge gaps on {{the occurrence of}} pathogens in different streams of wastewater, e. g. greywater and domestic wastewater. The aims were also to measure the removal of pathogens in different treatment processes, conventional and innovative, and correlate the removal to that of common microbial process indicators, such as faecal coliforms, enterococci, Cl. perfringens spores and bacteriophages. One study also assessed {{the correlation between the}} removal of microorganisms and some commonly measured physico-chemical process indicators. The results can be applied in microbial risk assessments (MRAs) of urban wastewater systems. Indicators and parasitic (oo) cysts were enumerated with standard methods and viruses with rtPCR. High levels of Giardia cysts and enteroviruses were found in untreated wastewater (103. 2 and 104. 2 L- 1 respectively) indicating high incidences in the society. Noroviruses were also often found in high numbers (103. 3 L- 1) during winter, but less frequent and in lower numbers (102. 3 L- 1) {{during the rest of the}} year. This temporal variation correlated to the clinical laboratory reporting of noroviruses. A temporal variation was also shown for Giardia with significantly lower cyst counts in untreated wastewater during spring. Cryptosporidium oocysts were not as numerous in untreated wastewater (5 L- 1) reflecting a lower incidence in the society than for the other pathogens during the time of the study. Since temporal variation had a larger impact than spatial, site-specific measurements may not be necessary to perform screening level MRAs of wastewater discharge and reuse. Good data can be found in the literature and corrected for by recovery of the detection method, flow and incidence in the society. Removal of microorganisms in wastewater treatments varied from 0 to > 5. 8 log due to process combination and organism in question. Treatment in integrated hydroponics removed microorganism more efficiently than did secondary conventional treatment, though having longer hydraulic retention time. Tertiary treatment and treatment in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) showed better removal potential than treatment in upflow anaerobic <b>sludge</b> <b>blankets</b> (UASB) in a pilot plant. Human virus genomes were less removed and Giardia cysts more removed than all of the studied indicators. Enumeration with PCR, however, may underestimate infectious virion removal. Spores of sulphite-reducing anaerobes and somatic coliphages were significantly less removed than E. coli and enterococci in all the studied processes. Bacterial indicator and spore removals correlated to enterovirus genome removal (p< 0. 05), but the predictive values were low (R< 0. 4). Removals between microbial indicators and NH 4 -N, Kjeldal-N, COD and TOC correlated stronger (10 - 18 <p< 0. 02; 0. 43 <R< 0. 90). To manage the risk with reuse and discharge of wastewater, treatment performance targets have been calculated as a step in a hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) approach. These targets varied from 0 to 10. 4 log removal due to water (grey or wastewater), organism (rotavirus, Campylobacter or parasitic (oo) cysts) and exposure (drinking water, surface water, aerosols, irrigation of crops or public parks). Faecal contamination in greywater was measured by coprostanol and was shown to be 980 times lower than in wastewater, corresponding to 2. 9 log removal in treatment. Somatic coliphages were suggested to function as an index of virus removal in wastewater treatment processes as well as to be included in the monitoring of bathing water. The guideline level was suggested to be 300 PFU 100 mL- 1 based on MRA of enteroviruses. This level in a water sample would equal a probability of infection of 0. 3 % (95 th percentile 4 %). The risk is overestimated if animal sources dominate the faecal pollution. Development in methods to track sources of faecal pollution showed that if somatic coliphages are enumerated together with phages infecting Bacteroides strain GA 17, discriminating human from animal faecal pollution is possible based on the ratio between the phagesQC 2010101...|$|R

Modeling and simulation of an anaerobic digestion is very vital to identify the behavior of industrial waste water treatment plant to optimize its operations.

5000|$|A {{batch system}} is the {{simplest}} form of digestion. Biomass {{is added to the}} reactor {{at the start of the}} process in a batch and is sealed for the duration of the process. Batch reactors suffer from odour issues that can be a severe problem when they are emptied. Typically biogas production will be formed with a normal distribution pattern over time. The operator can use this fact to determine when they believe the process of digestion of the organic matter has completed. As the batch digestion is simple and requires less equipment and lower levels of design work it is typically a cheaper form of digestion. In continuous digestion processes organic matter is constantly added (continuous complete mixed)or added in stages to the reactor (continuous plug flow; first in - first out). Here the end products are constantly or periodically removed, resulting in constant production of biogas. A single or multiple digesters in sequence may be used. Examples of this form of anaerobic digestion include continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs), low anaerobic <b>sludge</b> <b>blanket</b> (UASB), Expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) and Internal circulation reactors (IC).TemperatureThere are two conventional operational temperature levels for anaerobic digesters, which are determined by the species of methanogens in the digesters:• Mesophilic which takes place optimally around 30-38 °C or at ambient temperatures between 20-45 °C where mesophiles are the primary microorganisms present.• Thermophilic which takes place around 49-57 °C at elevated temperatures up to 70 °C where thermophiles are the primary microorganisms present. There are a greater number of species of mesophiles than thermophiles [...] These bacteria are also more tolerant to changes in environmental conditions than thermophiles. Mesophilic systems are therefore considered to be more stable than thermophilicdigestion systems.As mentioned above, thermophilic digestion systems are considered to be less stable, the energy input is higher, and more energy is removed from the organic matter. However, the increased temperatures facilitate faster reaction rates and hence faster gas yields. Operation at higher temperatures facilitates greater sterilization of the end digestate. In countries where legislation, such as the Animal By-Products Regulations in the European Union, requires end products to meet certain levels of reduction in the amount of bacteria in the output material, this may be a benefit.Certain processes shred the waste finely and use a short high temperature and pressure pre-treatment (pasteurization / hygienisation) stage that significantly enhances the gas output of the following standard mesophilic stage. The hygienisation process is also applied in order to reduce the pathogenic micro-organisms in the feedstock. Hygienisation / pasteurization may be achieved by using a Landia BioChop hygienisation unit or similar method of combined heat treatment and solids maceration.A drawback of operating at thermophilic temperatures is that more heat energy input is required to achieve the correct operational temperatures. This increase in energy may not be outweighed by the increase in the outputs of biogas from the systems. It is therefore important to consider an energy balance for these systems. There are three principal products of anaerobic digestion: biogas, digestate and water.|$|E
40|$|A <b>sludge</b> <b>blanket</b> {{clarifier}} is {{a treatment}} unit combining flocculation and upward flow sedimentation, {{which is more}} efficient compared to the conventional sedimentation tank. It {{has the ability to}} treat water at a faster rate, resulting in less space requirement. The removal of suspended particles takes place by a combination of flocculation, sedimentation and straining as the water passes upwards through the blanket of sludge formed within the clarifier. The performance of the blanket appears to directly depend on the raw water quality, coagulant concentration, temperature and up flow velocity. However, there are no direct relationships available to help the operators to adjust these variables to obtain satisfactory performance of the clarifier. Hence it is essential to identify a characteristic that can be used as an indicator to monitor the <b>sludge</b> <b>blanket.</b> A study of literature showed that a parameter called “sludge cohesion coefficient (SCC) ” of sludge has been used in France (Degremont, 1991) to characterize the <b>sludge</b> <b>blanket.</b> However, the procedure given was not clear, and parameters to characterize performance of <b>sludge</b> <b>blanket</b> clarifiers in the tropical environments could not be found in the literature studied.
