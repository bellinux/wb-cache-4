Further guidance on how individuals can monitor their performance will be formulated by the ESR. Audit has an important role in continuing professional development and education for both individuals and departments. Improvements in the quality of the delivery of radiological services should be focused on self-improvement aided by identifying areas where further investment in services is required. The results of audit should be used within a positive, constructive and forward-looking framework and not used in a non-statistically valid way to judge individual performance.

40|$|An audit {{response}} allows {{access to}} an existing score from a subject's own performance (<b>self</b> <b>audit)</b> or from his coactor's performance (coactor audit). A previous study found that social stimuli (coactor present) increased audits relative to a non-social (no coactor) condition. The increase, designated a social-stimulus effect, {{was found to be}} due more to the coactor's score than to his mere presence. This finding suggested that the difference between self and coactor scores might affect the size of the social-stimulus effect. In the present study, six pairs of human subjects matched-to-sample for points that were exchangeable for money. During a session, matching-to-sample problems were distributed so that a subject's score was ahead, behind, or about even with his coactor's score. The even condition produced the largest social-stimulus effects, i. e., the most audits that could not be attributed to non-social variables such as time or number of problems. The even condition may have produced the largest social-stimulus effects {{because it was the only}} condition where the major social reinforcer (being ahead) could be both present or absent and, consequently, the even condition was the only one where audits had a discriminative function with respect to the presence of the major social reinforcer...|$|E
40|$|Human subjects, mostly between 11 and 16 yr old, {{matched to}} sample for points that were {{exchangeable}} for money. An audit response {{was defined as}} a response maintained by allowing a subject access to an existing score on his own (<b>self</b> <b>audit)</b> or a coactor's (coactor audit) performance. In Experiment I, changes from non-social procedures (no coactor) to social procedures (coactor present) increased self and coactor audits. Since both types of audits occurred at about the same rates during cooperation and parallel work procedures, the increases did not depend on the subjects' response interactions. Although Experiment I did not demonstrate that subjects were comparing scores, the frequent occurrence of each kind of audit within a brief time period (interpersonal audit) did indicate that it was reinforcing to have both scores at the same time. These interpersonal audits suggested that the coactor's score increased self audits during social procedures. Experiment II supported this notion: relative to a non-social procedure, self audits increased more during a parallel work procedure when the coactor's score was accessible than when it was not accessible. Thus, increases in other behaviors that occur {{in the presence of a}} coactor, i. e., social facilitation, may also result from or be increased by providing a coactor's score...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out {{analysing}} the operation of a drug rationalisation programme in a central London teaching district that had evolved from experience over 17 years. Creation of a limited list of about 700 drugs had been achieved by local consensus. Drug selection was based on appraisal of efficacy, safety, and cost and was undertaken by means of collaborative participation of most consultant specialists in the district. Educative and other non-restrictive strategies for reinforcing the rationalisation policy had achieved a consistently high rate of compliance in prescribing recommended drugs. The concept of selectivity in drug use and its continuous local reappraisal had a beneficial impact on the prescribing habits of doctors {{at all levels of}} seniority {{as well as on the}} training of medical undergraduates and nurses in the therapeutic use of medicines. Peer review and <b>self</b> <b>audit</b> were encouraged by use of an extensive monitoring system which incorporated continuous "facilitative" dialogue between ward pharmacists and prescribers.

It is concluded that the second drug rationalisation programme model substantially improves the cost effective use of drugs in hospital and furthermore has the potential of being extended to general practice, especially in types of prescribing that are common to both forms of patient care...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - It is now {{acknowledged}} that Early Supplier Involvement (ESI) in product development confers a competitive advantage. However, {{the implementation of}} ESI has been further extended to consider successful product development, particularly through the Relationship Assessment Programme (RAP) model (Lamming et al., 1996), as an interactive process between a customer firm and a supplier. We adopt {{this point of view}} in our paper aiming at shaping the outline of customer's ability to co-design with suppliers in New Product Development (NPD). Design/methodology/approach - We adopted an action research approach based on longstanding interactions between researchers and of six French industrial manufacturers for the co-construction of local knowledge which can finally serve to build generic actionable knowledge. The feedback provided by a case application of the tool in one industrial setting is described. Findings - We introduce two dimensions to specify the customer's ability to co-design with suppliers: Open-mindedness and Capability. We propose a <b>self</b> <b>audit</b> tool based on a maturity grid approach to assess, via both these dimensions, the ability of a project team to successfully set up and manage the co-development project with suppliers. Originality/value - Although Early Supplier Involvement has emerged in previously published studies as critical factor in improving performance in Product Development, the unit of analysis is often the supplier in terms of selection and interaction processes. In this context, the absorptive ability of the customer's project team has not been examined. Further, we propose a structured method to assess this ability and an associated tool empirically tested. Practical implications - This tool will serve as a basis for defining the continuous improvement strategy needed to guarantee the success of the collaboration...|$|E
40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} is very volatile; it is characterized by unpredictable cycles of sharp rises and plunges in oil prices. This cyclical nature presents a huge challenge for companies that are operating in the industry. Companies {{have to be able to}} ramp up their production quickly so that they have enough capacity to meet increasing demand when oil prices go up and be able to survive when oil prices go down. In this context, companies have to make sure that their suppliers are flexible to changing demand. Assessing supplier flexibility is one of the major challenges facing our thesis sponsor company, which is one of the largest oil field services companies in the world. Our project has two primary goals. First we would like to develop a sound understanding of common factors that characterizes flexibility of suppliers in oil and {{gas industry}}. Second, we would like to develop the first version of a <b>self</b> administered <b>audit</b> able instrument to assess the flexibility of suppliers. We developed a comprehensive list of factors influencing flexibility of suppliers through systematic literature review and interview research methodology. We then designed a survey to validate the flexibility factors using statistical measures. Finally, we developed the first version self assessment instrument using Microsoft Excel. The instrument would help our thesis sponsor company to assess the flexibility of their supply base. The findings of our research would be useful to companies operating in seasonal and cyclical industries. The research might help companies develop insights regarding flexibility of their suppliers to adapt to changing market demands, and develop strategies to balance supply and demand at minimum cost. by Peng Bi and Remya Pushpangatha Kurup.
