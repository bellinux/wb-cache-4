Open and consensus-oriented discussions in committee meetings are regarded as a precondition of the success of the OMC and as a basis of its legitimacy.

40|$|First lines: National parliaments, {{it turns}} out, {{are not the}} poor losers of EU {{integration}} – at least not anymore. A recent comparative study shows {{that they are in}} general rather active in EU affairs. This is all the more the case, where they are in a strong institutional position in EU affairs. In addition, their activities vary depending on the parliamentary function they emphasise most. Over the course of EU integration, national parliaments have undergone a profound process of formal Europeanisation and are now generally in a much better position to become involved in EU affairs. This adaptation has also followed roughly similar institutional patterns. National parliaments have all established <b>specialised</b> <b>committees</b> – the European Affairs Committees (EACs) – and they have obtained extended rights to be informed about and to give their views on European legislative proposals. Yet the question to what extent parliaments actually make use of their better formal position still remained open, especially given that MPs are well known for not regularly using all the weapons in their armoury.

40|$|The OECD groups 30 member {{countries}} in an organisation that, most importantly, provides governments a {{setting in which}} to discuss, develop and perfect economic and social policy. They compare experiences, seek answers to common problems and work to co-ordinate domestic and international policies that increasingly in today's globalised world must form a web of even practice across nations. Exchanges between OECD governments flow from information and analysis provided by a Secretariat in Paris. Parts of the OECD Secretariat collect data, monitor trends, analyse and forecast economic developments, while others research social changes or evolving patterns in trade, environment, agriculture, technology, taxation and more. This work, in areas that mirror the policy-making structures in ministries of governments, is done in close consultation with policy-makers who will use the analysis, and it underpins discussion by {{member countries}} when they meet in <b>specialised</b> <b>committees</b> of the OECD. The countries meet and exchange information in committees. The committees gather together representatives of the Member countries either from the national administrations or from delegations to the OECD in Paris. The supreme authority is the Council, whose decisions are final. THE OECD has about 200 committees, working groups and technical sub-groups.

40|$|The recent rapid {{socio-economic}} {{development in}} Saudi Arabia has significantly affected the administrative systems at local, {{regional and national}} levels. The administrative system in Saudi Arabia went through several stages starting with the administrative system before the unification of the Kingdom, Omara system, Regional system and the new Provincial System. The issue of decentralisation {{and its role in}} enhancing developmental efforts through the processes of delegated authorities is very crucial nowadys. The present thesis examines the policies of decentralisation, the decision-making process and developmental issues {{in the context of the}} various administrative systems in Saudi Arabia. After a historical investigation for the various administrative systems in Saudi Arabia, the thesis concentrates on the new Provincial System, and its role in raising the level of the administrative functions and socio-economic development particularly in the Riyadh province. The formation of the provincial councils, as a cornerstone of the new Provincial System, can be considered as a tool for the application of decentralised policies, and a step forward towards citizen's participation in the socio-economic development of their provinces, governorates, districts and localities. The present study discusses the various aspects pertaining to Riyadh Provincial Council, its composition, members, duties and responsibilities. The study also discusses the functions of the <b>specialised</b> <b>committees,</b> and their role in speeding-up the decision-making process of the Provincial Councils. This research, which is based on a sample survey, concludes that the new administrative system of Provincial Councils played an important role in improving and promoting the quality of performance in government organs, specially when compared with the earlier administrative systems such as the "Omara System" and the "Regional System". The empirical study shows that most of the respondents believe that the new Provincial System may broaden the base of public participation, specially in regards to the issues of local development. The present study shows that the formation of the Provincial Councils is a step forward towards decentralisation in Saudi Arabia, and the inclusion of various professionals namely, scientists, engineers, physicians, administrators, businessmen and academicians into the Provincial Councils has broadened the structure of the council. However, the present study shows that the role of the Provincial Council is a consultative one, and there is no intention to expand its role to legislative issues, at least for the time being...|$|E

40|$|This book {{originates}} from {{an attempt}} to investigate whether, and, if so, to what extent, the Parliaments of today, are, notwithstanding the complex transformations {{that have occurred in}} legal orders, still “Parliaments in committees”, as they were depicted by Leopoldo Elia in the past century. Relying on the assumption of prominent scholars and politicians, such as Josep Barthélemy, Woodrow Wilson and Michel Debré, the research aims to place the arrangement and powers of the various parliamentary committee systems in relation to the actual form of government, by looking at constitutional and legislative provisions, standing orders and rules of procedures, conventions and parliamentary practices. This allows us to test several hypotheses which form the basis of the present work: whether the structure, functions and prerogatives of standing committees determine the level of autonomy of parliamentary decision-making towards the executive; thus, whether the strength of legislatures largely relies on the position and the role of its committee system; and, finally, whether the attempts to undermine the committee systems pose a challenge to the institutional balance between the executive and the legislative branch, and, in the end, also de-legitimise the policy-making process. The analysis is carried out using the comparative law methodology, and, in particular, the so-called “prototypical case logic”, employed by Ran Hirschl, in selecting the case-studies. Five “models” have been identified in order to consider parliamentary organisation, especially the committee system, and the form of government: the U. S. Congress, the British, French, Italian and the European Parliaments. The inclusion of the European Parliament, and, therefore, of the European Union, is justified by its distinctive features: first of all, although it has a different nature, the European Union’s aspiration to mirror the functioning of nation states by combining national constitutional traditions in a new and creative way makes it a suitable model (in its constant tension between fused and separated power systems) for investigation; secondly, particularly after the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has become a truly powerful institution, with regard to its legislative and oversight powers; thirdly, the European Parliament, mirroring the European Union, {{is the result of a}} combination of national parliamentary traditions which aims to make a potentially cumbersome decision-making process rapid and effective. Trying to develop the arguments raised by constitutional law scholars in the Twentieth century further, it is argued that, in the new century, not only should the mere existence of parliamentary standing committees be considered, but also the way in which “committee systems” are shaped and function. The term “committee system” encompasses the coherent and rational organisation of standing and <b>specialised</b> <b>committees,</b> in their mutual relationship, in their relationships with other parliamentary bodies and with the executive. After the definition of what a committee system is, and their historical origins in the five legal orders, the analysis is divided into two parts. The first part deals with the strength of the five committee systems, initially examining their discipline in terms of the number of committees, their size, appointments, internal organisation, party influence, transparency and resources, and then taking the procedural and organisational tools for inter-committee co-ordination into account as well as their autonomy with regard to other parliamentary bodies. The second part considers committee systems in their relationship with the executive branch, and, in particular, the presence of the executive in the committee system; the status of the opposition; how the agenda of committees is defined; the acknowledgement of veto or decision-making powers to committees; and the way in which committees exercise their legislative and the oversight functions. The definition of four types of committee systems (“weak”, “partially influential”, “strong”, and “predominant”), according to their level of specialisation, mutual co-ordination and autonomy vis-à-vis other parliamentary bodies, and then of four different forms of government based upon the features of the committee systems and their relationship with the executive (“insignificant”, “majoritarian”, “consensual”, and “decisive”) aims to explain how each committee-system model fits into a constitutional legal order, and thereby determines certain characteristics. Otherwise, the adoption of a non-corresponding committee system can be dysfunctional for the performance of the form of government and can cause schizophrenic effects for the determination of the general political directions and priorities (“indirizzo politico”). This is what happened, during the first forty years of the Italian Republic (1948 - 1992), when a form of government based upon a “decisive” committee system operated in the presence of “the confidence relationship” between the Parliament and the executive, further enhancing the fragmentation of the indirizzo politico. Indeed, especially in parliamentary forms of government, the organisational features, functions and powers of standing committees as a system strongly influence the stability of the executive. Given the ability of parliamentary committee systems to shape the form of government, albeit in combination with other elements – such as the provision of the “confidence relationship” – it would seem appropriate to protect and eventually enhance standing committees, as well as their co-ordination, through ad hoc legislative provisions and the amendment of parliamentary rules of procedure. Only a “strong” committee system is capable of striking an effective balance between politics and the technical constraints of legislation, and between transparency and the informality of decision-making processes, of dealing with public policies that have become more and more cross-sectional, of contributing to the definition of a unitary and coherent “indirizzo politico” amongst the different policy sectors, and of making the executive-legislative relationship more balanced, especially when the oversight powers of standing committees have been re-inforced...|$|E
