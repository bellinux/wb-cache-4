40|$|PEP's Standby Power System {{consists}} of the diesel generators, the generator control system, Rm 308 UPS, switchgear batteries, and the electrical equipment used to distribute this power. Due {{to the nature of}} the equipment and its use throughout general industry, the majority of the system falls within the CGI definition HNF-PRO- 268. ''Control of Purchased Items and Services'' and HNF-PRO- 1819, ''PHMC Engineering Requirements'' require that the critical characteristics of CGI-procured equipment be established in an engineering document prior to placing the order. HNF- 5043 establishes these critical characteristics for the <b>Standby</b> Power System. <b>Equipment</b> will be added to the list as required to support future CGI procurements...|$|R
40|$|Integrating {{renewable}} energy into built environments requires additional {{attention to the}} balancing {{of supply and demand}} due to their intermittent nature. Demand Side Response (DSR) has the potential to make money for organisations as well as support the System Operator as the generation mix changes. There is an opportunity to increase the use of existing technologies in order to manage demand. Company-owned standby generators are a rarely used resource; their maintenance schedule often accounts for a majority of their running hours. DSR encompasses a range of technologies and organisations; Sustainability First (2012) suggest that the System Operator (SO), energy supply companies, Distribution Network Operators (DNOs), Aggregators and Customers all stand to benefit from DSR. It is therefore important to consider impact of DSR measures to each of these stakeholders. This paper assesses the financial implications of organisations using existing <b>standby</b> generation <b>equipment</b> for DSR in order to avoid peak electricity charges. It concludes that under the current GB electricity pricing structure, there are several regions where running diesel generators at peak times is financially beneficial to organisations. Issues such as fuel costs, Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) charges, maintenance costs and electricity prices are discussed...|$|R

In this paper, the whole Tele-Protection system is divided into six subsystems. The first subsystem is digital relaying equipment. Second subsystem is the tale-protection signaling equipment where the timing to sample line power currents is synchronized. Both relaying and Tele-Protection signaling equipments, are now assemble three-phase current data, sampled at 600 Hz for 50 Hz EHV systems and some control data into a 90 bit frame format at a transmission rate of 54 Kb/s. A frame consists of a frame synchronization field and some information fields including a cycle‘s redundancy check field. The third subsystem, Tele-Protection signed multiplexing equipment generates a super frame by multiplexing the seven, 54 Kb/s Tele-Protection signals into a 1. 544 Mb/s stage using multi-point sampling technique to minimize the delay time variation {{and send them to}} the subsystem four, which is radio equipment, from here the data is transmitted {{with the help of the}} channel (subsystem 5) to the repeater station (subsystem 6). The subsystem six is used to remove the noise and to improve the power of the data.

50|$|The HDB {{started the}} Lift Telemonitoring System (TMS) in 1984 to monitor lifts in {{high-rise}} public housing. As at Aug 2007, more than 17,500 lifts are {{monitored by the}} system. TMS uses SCADA technology to monitor {{the status of the}} lifts in real-time from a centralized master station for events such as breakdown and trapped passengers. The lift maintenance companies are automatically notified of any problem and in most cases, repairs are carried out even before a complaint is received. The introduction of TMS has resulted in better lift performance as historical data allowed the Town Councils, who are maintaining the HDB estates, to pinpoint problem areas and improve the method of maintenance. Besides detecting problems with the lifts, TMS {{can also be used to}} carry out remote testing of lifts and other emergency <b>standby</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} find out the {{challenges}} being faced in the use and teaching of computers in secondary schools in Chihota District, Zimbabwe. Six secondary schools in the Chihota rural area participated in the study. Questionnaires and interviews were used as research instruments. Literature related to the topic was reviewed in Chapter Two in order to get an insight on the topic so as to develop a framework upon which findings were based. The findings revealed that there were problems in the use and teaching of computers in schools. The major problems were lack of a dedicated ICT policy on education, shortage of computer equipment, shortage of computer teachers and technical personnel, inadequate funding to procure and repair computers and lack of electricity. The study recommended the government to put in place a dedicated policy for the use and teaching of computers in education. The policy would make it possible for the government to fully support the education sector by providing the necessary resources for the full implementation of the programme. Schools on the other hand were recommended to create specific computer budgets to buy computers, computer software and cater for computer repairs. Schools were also recommended to send their computer teachers for computer refresher courses and also buy reliable <b>standby</b> power supply <b>equipment</b> such as powerful generators and UPS systems in the event that there were power outages. Finally, school heads were recommended to engage the corporate world and form PPPs with whom they could ensure the smooth running of computer departments...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis and its rippling {{effects on the}} wider corporate sector have prompted companies to rethink how they govern and manage risk. This paper discusses the board’s role in the governance of risk {{and the benefits of}} establishing a separate board-level risk-management committee—a need that applies to financial and nonfinancial institutions, as well as large and small companies. Foreword All business decisions involve risk. The challenge to boards and senior management is to balance risk with acceptable reward, to create value without hazarding the enterprise. This means understanding the corporate exposure to risk, determining how those risks are to be faced, and ensuring that they are handled appropriately. There are four possible responses to a business risk: 1. Avoid the risk. Abandon the proposed project. 2. Mitigate the risk. Make capital investments or incur ongoing expenditures—for example, by obtaining <b>standby</b> <b>equipment,</b> duplicating critical components, investing in staff training—plus establish risk policies, such as requiring top executives to travel separately in case of an accident. 3. Transfer the risk. Spread the exposure to other parties. Insure against the risk, although some risks may be uninsurable. Hedge the risk by negotiating long-term contracts. Create derivative instruments, agreements with financial institutions that transfer the risk to third parties...|$|E

40|$|Decision {{making as}} a part of nuclear power plant {{operations}} is a critical, but common, task. Plant management is forced to make decisions that may have safety and economic consequences. Formal decision theory offers the potential for a structured approach capable of taking into account risk-related aspects (plant and worker safety, for instance) and, at the same time, important factors like economics and regulatory requirements. Since power generation involves large capital and operational costs, making the decision process more efficient can lead to significant economical savings. With millions of dollars at stake, it is imperative that operational decisions be made in a logical and consistent fashion. In addition to the monetary concerns, a primary driver for this work is the desire to make defensible decisions. Within a structured organization like a nuclear power plant, a variety of interactions take place between groups of decision makers. These groups are asked to provide guidance on a variety of issues, ranging from complex regulatory requirements to planning maintenance activities of <b>standby</b> <b>equipment.</b> By providing an integrated package for decision making, it is believed that tools like the plant risk assessment {{can be used in a}} defensible manner as part of the day-to-day operation of the facility. The goal of this report is to describe a decision methodology for nuclear power plant incidents. Here, incidents are categorized as plant upsets that are not serious challenges to plant safety, but nonetheless require an appropriate response. (cont.) As part of this decision methodology, risk assessment, worker safety, economics, preferences, and formal decision making models make up the foundation. We describe the construction, analysis heuristics, and inherent uncertainty of these models. From this methodological framework, we developed a prototypical on-line advisory tool that provides decisional advice relevant to incident management. The capabilities of this prototype are discussed along with a demonstration via case studies. by Curtis Lee Smith. Thesis (Ph. D.)
