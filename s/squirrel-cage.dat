25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional <b>squirrel-cage</b> rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E

50|$|<b>Squirrel-cage</b> {{induction}} motor: The {{most common}} type of shaded-pole motor in fractional horsepower use is the <b>squirrel-cage</b> induction motor.

50|$|Compared to a <b>squirrel-cage</b> rotor, {{the rotor}} of the {{slip ring motor}} has more winding turns; the induced voltage is then higher, and the current lower, than for a <b>squirrel-cage</b> rotor. During the {{start-up}} a typical rotor has 3 poles connected to the slip ring. Each pole is wired in series with a variable power resistor. When the motor reaches full speed the rotor poles are switched to short circuit. During start-up the resistors reduce the field strength at the stator. As a result the inrush current is reduced. Another important advantage over <b>squirrel-cage</b> motors is higher starting torque.|$|E

50|$|Nowadays, {{synchronous}} motors {{are frequently}} driven by transistorized variable-frequency drives. This greatly eases {{the problem of}} starting the massive rotor of a large synchronous motor. They may also be started as induction motors using a <b>squirrel-cage</b> winding that shares the common rotor: once the motor reaches synchronous speed, no current is induced in the <b>squirrel-cage</b> winding so it has {{little effect on the}} synchronous operation of the motor, aside from stabilizing the motor speed on load changes.|$|E
50|$|This {{is why a}} <b>squirrel-cage</b> {{blower motor}} may cause {{household}} lights to dim upon starting, but does not dim the lights on startup when its fan belt (and therefore mechanical load) is removed. Furthermore, a stalled <b>squirrel-cage</b> motor (overloaded or with a jammed shaft) will consume current limited only by circuit resistance as it attempts to start. Unless something else limits the current (or cuts it off completely) overheating and destruction of the winding insulation is the likely outcome.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Squirrel-cage</b> and wound-rotor motors {{are further}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} type of enclosure they use to protect their interior windings. These enclosures fall into two broad categories: ...|$|E
50|$|A {{synchronous}} motor {{may have a}} <b>squirrel-cage</b> winding embedded in its rotor, used to increase the motor starting torque and so decrease the time to accelerate to synchronous speed. The squirrel cage winding of a synchronous machine will generally be smaller than for an induction machine of similar rating. When the rotor is turning {{at the same speed}} as the stator's revolving magnetic field, no current is induced into the <b>squirrel-cage</b> windings and the windings will have no further effect on the operation of the {{synchronous motor}} at steady-state.|$|E
50|$|In operation, the <b>squirrel-cage</b> motor may {{be viewed}} as a {{transformer}} with a rotating secondary. When the rotor is not rotating in sync with the magnetic field, large rotor currents are induced; the large rotor currents magnetize the rotor and interact with the stator's magnetic fields to bring the rotor almost into synchronization with the stator's field. An unloaded <b>squirrel-cage</b> motor at rated no-load speed will consume electrical power only to maintain rotor speed against friction and resistance losses. As the mechanical load increases, so will the electrical load - the electrical load is inherently related to the mechanical load. This is similar to a transformer, where the primary's electrical load is related to the secondary's electrical load.|$|E
50|$|If a {{conventional}} <b>squirrel-cage</b> rotor has flats ground {{on it to}} create salient poles and increase reluctance, it will start conventionally, but will run synchronously, although it can provide only a modest torque at synchronous speed. This {{is known as a}} reluctance motor.|$|E
50|$|These {{were used}} where high {{starting}} torque was required. They started as repulsion motors, {{but once they}} were running at a sizable fraction of full speed, the brushes were lifted mechanically and all commutator bars were short-circuited together to create {{the equivalent of a}} <b>squirrel-cage</b> induction motor.|$|E
50|$|Induction (asynchronous) motor, {{the rotor}} {{magnetic}} field {{is created by}} an induced current. The rotor must turn slightly slower (or faster) than the stator magnetic field to provide the induced current. There are three types of induction motor rotors, which are <b>squirrel-cage</b> rotor, wound rotor and solid core rotor.|$|E
5000|$|Most common AC motors use the <b>squirrel-cage</b> rotor, {{which will}} be found in {{virtually}} all domestic and light industrial alternating current motors. The <b>squirrel-cage</b> refers to the rotating exercise cage for pet animals. The motor {{takes its name from}} the shape of its rotor [...] "windings"- a ring {{at either end of the}} rotor, with bars connecting the rings running the length of the rotor. It is typically cast aluminum or copper poured between the iron laminates of the rotor, and usually only the end rings will be visible. The vast majority of the rotor currents will flow through the bars rather than the higher-resistance and usually varnished laminates. Very low voltages at very high currents are typical in the bars and end rings; high efficiency motors will often use cast copper to reduce the resistance in the rotor.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Squirrel-cage</b> {{induction}} motors {{are very}} prevalent in industry, in sizes from fractional horsepower (fraction of a kilowatt) {{up to several}} thousand horsepower (a few megawatts). They are simple, rugged, self-starting, and maintain a reasonably constant speed from light load to full load, set by {{the frequency of the}} power supply and the number of poles of the stator winding.|$|E
50|$|The General Electric Company began {{developing}} three-phase induction motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse {{signed a}} cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the <b>squirrel-cage</b> rotor. Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100 horsepower (HP) induction motor currently {{has the same}} mounting dimensions as a 7.5 HP motor in 1897.|$|E
50|$|An {{induction}} motor, 3 phase {{induction motor}} or asynchronous motor is an AC electric motor {{in which the}} electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is obtained by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding. An induction motor can therefore be made without electrical connections to the rotor. An induction motor's rotor can be either wound type or <b>squirrel-cage</b> type.|$|E
50|$|Today these {{generators}} aren't used {{any more}} in modern turbines. Instead today most turbines use variable speed generators combined with partial- or full-scale power converter between the turbine generator and the collector system, which generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection and have Low voltage ride through-capabilities.

50|$|In Thailand {{this system}} {{has been used by}} 470 farmer groups. (May, 2008). The process {{required}} 30 days to finish without turning, with 10 metric tons of compost (10 piles) obtained each time. A 15-inch <b>squirrel-cage</b> blower was used to force the air through 10 static piles of compost, one at a time, for 15 minute periods twice a day. The raw materials consisted of agricultural wastes and animal manure in the ratio of 3:1 by volume.|$|E
50|$|DOL {{starting}} {{is sometimes}} used to start small water pumps, compressors, fans and conveyor belts. In {{the case of}} an asynchronous motor, such as the 3-phase <b>squirrel-cage</b> motor, the motor will draw a high starting current until it has run up to full speed. This starting current is typically 6-7 times greater than the full load current. To reduce the inrush current, larger motors will have reduced-voltage starters or variable speed drives in order to minimise voltage dips to the power supply.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the founders}} (the other two were Nikola Tesla and Galileo Ferraris) of {{three-phase}} electrical systems, he developed the three-phase electrical generator and a three-phase electrical motor (1888) and studied star and delta connections. The triumph of the three-phase system was displayed in Europe at the International Electro-Technical Exhibition of 1891, where Dolivo-Dobrovolsky used this system to transmit electric power at the distance of 176 km with 75% efficiency. In 1891 he also created a three-phase transformer and short-circuited (<b>squirrel-cage)</b> induction motor.|$|E
50|$|In the past, repulsion-start wound-rotor motors {{provided}} high starting torque, {{but with}} added complexity. Their rotors {{were similar to}} those of universal motors, but their brushes were connected only to each other. Transformer action induced current into the rotor. Brush position relative to field poles meant that starting torque was developed by rotor repulsion from the field poles. A centrifugal mechanism, when close to running speed, connected all commutator bars together to create the equivalent of a <b>squirrel-cage</b> rotor. As well, when close to operating speed, better motors lifted the brushes out of contact.|$|E
