40|$|In 1998, Commander, Marine Corps Logistics Bases {{established}} the Executive Planning Group (EPG) {{to develop and}} coordinate strategy to enhance the depots' maintenance and supply capabilities {{in order to increase}} the competitiveness of their services and provide a direction for future depot operations. One of the initiatives introduced by the EPG was to conduct an analysis to determine if consolidating depot maintenance for the LAV from the current workload scenario at two depots, to a <b>single</b> <b>site,</b> results in the most efficient allocation of resources. We use spreadsheet models to conduct a comparative cost and savings analysis between the current split workload scenario and a <b>single</b> <b>site</b> scenario at each depot. We address costs and savings resulting from data such as infrastructure requirements, transportation, inventory reductions, and reduction in personnel structure requirements. We also address additional issues such as the impact on readiness and surge capacity. Our results vary significantly depending on the selection of depot for <b>single</b> <b>siting.</b> We show that <b>single</b> <b>siting</b> at one depot results in annual savings from the current workload scenario, while <b>single</b> <b>siting</b> at the other depot increases annual costs from the current workload scenario.

40|$|Policymakers’ {{fears of}} an {{increased}} concentration of marginalised and disadvantaged groups in already vulnerable urban neighbourhoods have prompted recent measures {{to combat the}} spatial concentration of human service facilities. In many cities, distributive <b>siting</b> <b>policies</b> have aimed to achieve a more equal distribution of homelessness facilities across areas. This article provides a critical assessment of the ‘fair share’ criteria that are in use in Dutch <b>siting</b> <b>policies.</b> It brings to the surface the normative and political nature of these criteria that often remains implicit in such policies. The research shows that policy is dominated by discourse focusing on the potentially negative effects these facilities may have on surrounding neighbourhoods in terms of safety and security. As a consequence, the perspective of homeless people {{is in danger of}} being overlooked by policymakers, risking a reduced accessibility to service facilities. This article develops an analytical framework {{that can be used to}} study fair share <b>siting</b> <b>policies,</b> and provides policymakers with guidelines for assessing where services should be located...|$|R
