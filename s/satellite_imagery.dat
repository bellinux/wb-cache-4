5|$|Early on September7, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{noted that}} {{although}} Maria {{was in an}} area of favorable atmospheric conditions, most intensity guidance models did not anticipate any strengthening. The system changed little in organization over the next 24hours as it moved rapidly toward the west-northwest around the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge. Though visible <b>satellite</b> <b>imagery</b> depicted a well-organized circulation center, it was displaced from the strongest convection due to increased vertical wind shear. The system reached an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h) on September8 before the unfavorable environment began to impede the system's organization. Following a reconnaissance flight into the system early on September9, it was noted that Maria had degenerated into a non-tropical disturbance, despite reports of tropical storm-force winds in the northern Leeward Islands. Operationally, however, the NHC kept the system classified as a tropical cyclone and never downgraded it to a disturbance. When the system approached the northern Leeward Islands on September10, <b>satellite</b> <b>imagery</b> and surface observations revealed an increase in its organization; a subsequent reconnaissance aircraft into the disturbance revealed that the remnants of Maria had regenerated into a tropical cyclone about 40mi (65km) east-southeast of Antigua.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{designation}} as a named storm, Carlos drifted generally north-northwestward while {{embedded within}} a weak steering regime. The cyclone struggled {{with a combination of}} northerly wind shear and dry air entrainment, limiting the storm's associated deep convection to the eastern quadrant.

Deep convection became increasingly symmetric about the eye, and the cyclone reached its initial peak intensity six hours later with winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg). However, early on June14, the presentation of Carlos began to deteriorate as a result of upwelling and the ingestion of dry air; the eye became obscured and banding features decreased as evident on <b>satellite</b> <b>imagery,</b> while the eyewall became increasingly ill-defined on radar.
