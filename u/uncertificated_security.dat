Each participant is allocated a unique participant code. A security holder on CHESS must be either a CHESS participant or be sponsored by one (e.g., a client of a broker). Sponsored <b>uncertificated</b> <b>security</b> holders are allocated a unique holder identifying code (HIN) in CHESS, which together with the participant's code provides the authority under which CHESS will allow a transfer of securities.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of the <b>uncertificated</b> <b>securities</b> in the context of financial law. Proper and prudential legal regulation of the securities is considered to be key element of efficient financial markets of which the importance for the economics is systematically growing in past few decades. From the beginning, financial markets were dominated by certificated securities represented by legal fiction incorporating rights arising from the security into a certificate and considering this certificate as a tangible movable asset. In the consequence of the development of financial markets and <b>securities</b> trading <b>uncertificated</b> <b>securities</b> were developed to make transfers of the securities and asset management feasible. <b>Uncertificated</b> <b>securities</b> can be defined as substitutable physical securities incorporating private rights which are prerequisite for the exercise and transfer of those rights and which are replaced by a record entered in the central register of securities, mainly central securities depositories. The form of the <b>uncertificated</b> <b>securities</b> determines the necessity of their special legal regulation taking into account their legal nature and connected legal aspects of record keeping. The purpose of my thesis is to analyse relevant Czech legislation and highlight both [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Russian Parliament has {{modified}} the Civil Code recently. This reform has also covered {{the regime of}} <b>uncertificated</b> <b>securities.</b> Under the modified Civil Code (RCC) <b>uncertificated</b> <b>securities</b> do not constitute chattels but claims and other rights against the issuer. The legislator has also precised such issues as the methods of transfer {{and the creation of}} an interest upon those securities (Art. 149. 2 of the RCC), the protection of the titleholder including the rights of a bona fide purchaser (Art. 149. 3 of the RCC) and the liability of an intermediary resulting from the loss of the records (Art. 149. 5 of the RCC). In 2008, in Switzerland, the Parliament has adopted the Federal Intermediated Securities Act (FISA). The present Act has introduced a new object to the Swiss legal order: an intermediated security. The intermediated securities are distinguished from those in paper form and from the immobilized securities. The Swiss delegation has participated actively in the preparatory works that resulted later in the adoption of the UNIDROIT Convention on Substantive Rules for Intermediated Securities, also known as Geneva Securities Convention. However, this Convention has not been ratified by Switzerland. The author analyzes the key issues of the reform in relation to <b>uncertificated</b> <b>securities.</b> We examine in particular whether the provisions governing the regime of <b>uncertificated</b> <b>securities</b> under the modified Civil Code of the Russian Federation have become more compatible with Geneva Securities Convention. Finally, we will try to explain why this Convention is not in force and whether the Russian Federation and Switzerland could ratify it.  </p...|$|R
40|$|A sound {{financial}} {{system is the}} cornerstone of any country‘s economy. As South Africa has always been deemed to have a sound legal framework pertaining to the financial market, it has never faced the situation where it had to extensively review its entire legal framework. However, the recent global economic meltdown left policy makers, internationally, questioning the soundness of their {{financial system}}s and South Africa has been no exception. This dissertation provides an overview of the legal framework pertaining to selected segments of the financial market. This legal framework is then tested against certain selected issues highlighted by the global economic meltdown in order to establish whether it was and still is sufficiently robust to effectively negotiate these challenges. In order to deal with the selected segments of the legal framework pertaining to the financial market as comprehensively as possible, the selected segments {{for the purposes of this}} dissertation include the capital market, the money market and the derivative market. This dissertation also evaluates the impact of other recent domestic developments pertaining to securities settlement in South Africa. These developments include the recently promulgated Companies Act 71 of 2008 and the currently drafted Participant Failure Manual. This dissertation suggests that the Companies Act 71 of 2008 will have a significant impact on securities settlement. It is recommended that companies, holders of <b>uncertificated</b> <b>securities</b> and holders of beneficial interests in <b>uncertificated</b> <b>securities</b> familiarise themselves with their revised rights and obligations in order to, amongst other things, ensure compliance with this new legislative framework. This dissertation reveals that, even though our financial system has been found to be fundamentally sound and thus far have dealt with the global economic meltdown quite well, legislative reform to conform to international best practice is imperative. It is recommended that policy makers should strive to ensure that the South African legal framework pertaining to the financial market is sufficiently aligned with the principles, methodologies and recommendations as provided for by the international institutions providing best practice. The highlighted areas of legislative reform include the legal frameworks pertaining to credit rating agencies, investor due diligence, ix crisis management tools, compensation structures, accounting and valuations standards, issuer transparency, market transparency and risk management. This dissertation highlights that a significant amount of legislative amendments and endorsements by the relevant regulators and the Master of the Court are required for the successful integration of the Participant Failure Manual into the legal framework pertaining to the financial market. If, when and how the notion of Participant Failure will be accepted and regulated by the relevant regulators, without creating a conflict of interest, remains a question to be answere...|$|R
