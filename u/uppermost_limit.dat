High relief and concomitant environmental gradients make mountain ecosystems very vulnerable to slight changes of temperatures and extreme precipitation events. Likewise, the role of mountain regions in providing life-sustaining water for communities in the western United States means that climatic and other environmental changes in these mountains will have a large impact not only on the region but in many other areas as well.

They are essentially of the manifestations of His origin. They would carry out ‘Panchakritya’ or Five Duties viz.1. Srishti or Creation would be performed by Brahma,2. Sthithi or protection by Vishnu,3. Laya or destruction by Rudra;4. the fourth task, viz. Tirobhav would be performed by Mahesa (After destruction millions of souls will be protected which is Concealment and Revival) and5. Sadha Shiva will give ‘Anugraha’(Providing Salvation).finally the most significant task of Anugraha would be the exclusive dispensation by Himself.But Brahma and Vishnu forgot the holy and supreme power and fought each other. By seeing the intensity of the battle, Lord Shiva assumed the form of a flaming Linga in between Brahma and Vishnu and challenged both of them by asking them to measure the gigantic Linga (phallic symbol of Lord Shiva).The place where lord Shiva manifested is Arunachala refers to the holy hill at Thiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu. The hill is also known by the names Arunagiri, Annamalai Hill, Arunachalam, Arunai, Sonagiri and Sonachalam.Awestruck by its magnitude, Brahma and Vishnu decided to find one end each to establish supremacy over the other. Lord Brahma took the form of a swan and went upwards while Lord Vishnu assumed the form of Varaha - a boar and went into the earth towards nether land. Both searched for thousands of miles but neither could find the end. On his journey upward, Brahma came across Ketaki flower. Exhausted and bewildered with his search to find the <b>uppermost</b> <b>limit</b> of fiery column, Brahma made Ketaki assent to lie that he had seen the top of the column where the flower had previously resided. Accompanied by his accomplice, Brahma confronted Vishnu and asserted that he had indeed discovered the origin of the cosmic column. At this point, {{the central part of the}} pillar split open and SadhaShiva revealed himself in his full glory. The night SadhaShiva revealed himself is celebrated as Shivaratri or Satya Ratri or Gyana Ratri on the Shivaratri Night. Overawed, both Brahma and Vishnu bowed before him accepted lord Shiva’s supremacy. Lord Sadha Shiva also explained to Brahma and Vishnu that both of them as well Rudra and Maheshwara were born out of lord Shiva and all the five were then separated out into Five different aspects of divinity. This day is regarded as Satya ratri or gyana ratri because Brahma and Vishnu lost their ego and found supreme almighty god is Sat Chit AnandaHowever, Lord Sadha Shiva was angry with Brahma for making a false claim. The Lord cursed Brahma that no one would ever pray to him. (This legend explains why there is hardly any Brahma temple of significance in India.) Lord Shiva also punished the Ketaki flower for testifying falsely and banned her from being used as an offering for any worship.While Lord Vishnu realized the mistake for it so vishnu got the boon that he will be equally beautiful as me (Shiva) but he too felt Ahamkaram as supreme (ego) so he did not supreme fame while Shankara or Rudra and Maheswara didn't felt ego or Ahamkaram So Lord Shiva gave them boon that there fame and power will be equal to mine.They both will praised as equal as me.Since it was on the 14th day in the dark fortnight of the month of Phalguna that Shiva first manifested himself in the form of a Linga, the day is extremely auspicious and is celebrated as Mahashivaratri - the grand night of Shiva. To celebrate the occasion, devotees of Lord Shiva fast during the day and pray to the Lord throughout the night. It is said that worshipping of Lord Shiva on Shivaratri bestows one with happiness and prosperity.Unlike most Hindu festivals which are celebrated during the day, Maha Shivaratri is celebrated at night. The celebration includes maintaining a [...] "jaagaran", an all-night vigil and prayers, because Shaiva Hindus mark this night as [...] "overcoming darkness and ignorance" [...] in one's life and the world through Shiva. Offerings of fruits, leaves, sweets and milk to Shiva are made, some perform all-day fasting with vedic or tantrik worship of Shiva, and some perform meditative Yoga.4In Shiva temples, [...] "Om Namah Shivaya", the sacred mantra of Shiva, is chanted through the day.The legend of marriage of Shankara and Parvati is one the most important legends related to the festival of Mahashivaratri.

The present study explored the carbon-physiology of an alpine shrub species (Quercus aquifolioides) grown at its upper elevational limit compared to lower elevations, to test whether the elevational limit of alpine shrubs (< 3 m in height) are determined by carbon limitation or growth limitation. We studied the seasonal variations in non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) and its pool size in Q. aquifolioides grown at 3000 m, 3500 m, and at its elevational limit of 3950 m above sea level (a. s. l.) on Zheduo Mt., SW China. The tissue NSC concentrations along the elevational gradient varied significantly with season, reflecting the season-dependent carbon balance. The NSC levels in tissues were lowest {{at the beginning of the}} growing season, indicating that plants used the winter reserve storage for re-growth in the early spring. During the growing season, plants grown at the elevational limit did not show lower NSC concentrations compared to plants at lower elevations, but during the winter season, storage tissues, especially roots, had significantly lower NSC concentrations in plants at the elevational limit compared to lower elevations. The present results suggest the significance of winter reserve in storage tissues, which may determine the winter survival and early-spring re-growth of Q. aquifolioides shrubs at high elevation, leading to the formation of the <b>uppermost</b> distribution <b>limit.</b> This result is consistent with a recent hypothesis for the alpine treeline formation...|$|R

Ruapehu, New Zealand: Lithostratigraphic tools to understand subplinian-plinian eruptions at andesitic volcanoes. " Bulletin of Volcanology 74 (3) : 617 - 640. A new detailed stratigraphy {{was developed for}} a sequence of pyroclastic deposits including the largest known eruptions associated with Mt. Ruapehu, deposited in the period ~ 27 - 10 ka BP cal. From the largest Plinian eruption deposits in this sequence, subtle lithofacies variations within componentry, pumice textures and sedimentary features were used to identify a systematic change in eruptive conditions over time. Early eruptions involved steady eruption columns, while younger eruptions involved unsteady, collapsing columns. Isopach and Isopleth (pumice and lithic) mapping of most widespread and distinctive units show that the largest explosive eruptions known from this volcano attained peak column heights between 22 and 37 km, with mass discharge rates reaching 107 - 108 kg/s. To characterise the conditions controlling the style of Plinian eruptions at this andesitic volcano, and to explain the systematic variation in column stability over time, five key units were sampled in detail, exemplifying the major contrasting lithofacies. The sampled tephras underwent grain-size analysis, along with quantification of componentry, porosimetry and density on particles {{of a range of}} size classes, as well as 2 D and 3 D microtextural analyses of juvenile pumice clasts to define vesicularity and crystallinity. In addition, physiochemical factors such as melt-evolution and volatile-contents were determined by analysing bulk pumice, glass-inclusions and residual glasses with electron microprobe and FTIRspectroscopy. Bulk compositions of these tephras vary from basaltic-andesite to andesite (56 - 62 wt. %, SiO 2), and had minimum pre-eruptive H 2 O contents of 4 - 5 wt. %. The evolution of eruption behaviour over time was not correlated to any progressive change in bulk geochemical properties, but instead resulted from variations in physical processes within the conduit. Ascending magmas experienced heterogeneous bubble nucleation, and later-erupted units showed increasing degrees of rheological heterogeneities developed across the conduit. Differences between units were due to changes in the magma decompression rates, the degree of bubble-crystal-melt interactions and bubble shearing, as well as the composition of the residual melt. Conditions that led to the most variable physical states of the magma reaching the fragmentation level resulted in the highest variability in pumice textures, the greatest range in styles of fragmentation, and the most unstable eruption columns. A new model describing the pre-eruptive magma storage region, conduit processes, magma fragmentation, and pyroclastic dispersal during Plinian eruptions at Mt. Ruapehu is proposed. This hypothesises that eruption column unsteadiness and collapse occurs when magma shear reaches extreme levels along the conduit under conditions of low isolated porosity (< 3 vol. %). This situation also generates the worst-case hazard scenarios expected for Ruapehu, eruptions, where Plinian columns of over 30 km may produce widespread tephra fall, as well as partially collapse to generate pyroclastic density currents of over 15 km runout...|$|R
40|$|The Mesoproterozoic Nain Plutonic Suite {{consists}} of anorthositic and granitic intrusions, which were emplaced along an older suture zone {{marked by the}} Torngat Orogen in northern Labrador. This study concerns the western margin of the Nain Plutonic Suite where the Pearly Gates Anorthosite pluton and spatially related Tessiarsuyungoakh intrusion, and the Makhavinekh Lake pluton, were intruded into the Paleoproterozoic Tasiuyak paragneiss of the Southeastern Churchill Province. Detailed geological mapping, petrography and U-Pb Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry dating of zircon and baddeleyite of the Pearly Gates Anorthosite pluton and Tessiarsuyungoakh intrusion were used to ascertain the mode of emplacement and crystallization ages of the major intrusive units. In addition, studies of the Paleoproterozoic regional metamorphism and Mesoproterozoic contact metamorphism of the Tasiuyak paragneiss were performed using the NaKFMASH petrogenetic grid to determine P-T conditions. The results of this thesis project indicate the following geological history of the study area. [...] The Tasiuyak paragneiss contains evidence of the Paleoproterozoic regional metamorphic mineral sub-assemblage garnet + biotite + sillimanite. Detailed petrography of this sub-assemblage indicated that the prograde and retrograde history of this unit occurred within the sillimanite stability field and peak P-T conditions were constrained {{in the range of}} 7. 2 to 10. 2 kbar and 800 ° to 830 °C. Prior to ca. 1363 Ma, reactivation of structures in the paragneiss provided fractures into which monzonitic and monzodioritic magmas intruded as sheets. The 1363 ± 3 Ma monzonite and 1360 ± 4 Ma monzodiorite formed the composite Tessiarsuyungoakh intrusion. This intrusion produced a small (< 20 m) contact aureole in the Tasiuyak paragneiss. Incipient development of the contact metamorphic sub-assemblage cordierite + orthopyroxene + spinel replaced the regional sub-assemblage of garnet + biotite + sillimanite. This suggests that the Tessiarsuyungoakh intrusion was a small body with a short-lived emplacement and crystallization history. The P-T estimate of this contact aureole is between 3 and 4 kbar and 775 ° and 800 °C. [...] Prismatic zircons included in plagioclase crystals from the Pearly Gates Anorthosite pluton yielded a maximum concordant crystallization age of 1370 ± 5 Ma. These crystals are interpreted as having formed at depth at ca. 1370 Ma, prior to emplacement at a mid-crustal level. The earliest evidence of anorthosite emplacement is a relatively undeformed anorthosite body, herein called the Fraser Canyon Anorthosite, which intruded into the Tessiarsuyungoakh intrusion at 1355 ± 1. 3 Ma. It is unknown if the Fraser Canyon Anorthosite {{is a part of the}} Pearly Gates Anorthosite pluton, however, both have similar characteristics such as an inner zone of massive anorthosite and an outer zone of layers of anorthosite and norite. The outer zone is interpreted as having crystallized relatively fast and the inner zone as having cooled relatively slowly. During crystallization of the outer zone, syn-emplacement deformation occurred along the contact between the Tessiarsuyungoakh intrusion and Pearly Gates Anorthosite pluton. Anhedral zircon fragments from the Pearly Gates Anorthosite pluton yielded an age of 1335 + 7 /- 3 Ma, of which the <b>uppermost</b> error <b>limit</b> of 1342 Ma is interpreted as approximating the final crystallization age of the pluton. Norite bodies that intruded the Pearly Gates Anorthosite pluton at ca. 1340 Ma are undeformed and indicate that the anorthosite had completely crystallized and deformation had ceased by this time. [...] At ca. 1322 Ma, the Makhavinekh Lake pluton intruded into the Tasiuyak paragneiss and produced a contact aureole 4 km wide with cordierite + orthopyroxene + spinel replacing regional garnet + biotite + sillimanite. The temperature gradient along this aureole ranged from 675 °C at the 4 km limit of the contact aureole, to at least 850 °C at the contact with the pluton, and isobaric conditions were between 3 to 4 kbar. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study of}} the zacatonal alpino zone of the volcanoes Popocatepetl (5452 in) and Nevado de Toluca (4690 m) in the central region of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt, is a {{follow-up}} {{of the study of}} ALMEIDA et al. (1994). This tropical alpine zacatonal represents the potential vegetation of the altitudinal belt between 3950 and 4500 in. These altitudinal limits constitute the <b>uppermost</b> <b>limit</b> of Pinus hartwegii forests and the lower limit of the periglacial areas that are almost without vegetation. On both volcanoes a total of 117 vegetation phytosociological relevees were made along the altitudinal gradient. They were clustered according to a classification analysis. The syntaxonomic scheme of the different units is presented and discussed. Special emphasis is given to the association level, aspects such as floristic composition, altitudinal zone, distribution and relation with environmental factors. Syntaxonomically new is the class Drabo jorullensis-Calama-grostietea tolucensis, which includes herbaceous formations dominated by tussock grasses, ground rosettes and cushions growing on Andosols and Lithosols. This class includes the orders Festucetalia lividae (ord. nov.) and Calamagrostietalia tolucensis. The first is located above 4150 m, and colonizes umbric Lithosol...|$|E
40|$|Samsung Electronics as a DRAM {{provider}} {{has kept}} its {{leadership in the}} DRAM market with leading technology and production capacity since the 1990 s {{even though there were}} unpredictable market fluctuations and dramatic changes in competition. Through the depressed market starting from 2006 to 2008, and the financial crisis, Samsung Electronics tightened its leading position in the DRAM market with changes in the dynamics of competition. But, from the industry wide view, the IT industry is getting complex since its system change from vertical integration to horizontal ecosystem. Also, the shrinkage of optical lithography, the main technical issue in semiconductor industry, is predicted to reach the <b>uppermost</b> <b>limit.</b> In this sense, Samsung Electronics as a DRAM provider should analyze and evaluate its current position in the DRAM market and the IT industry and needs to set a strategic goal and methods for sustaining its current position and also pursue more growth. I examine the current DRAM market dynamics, diagnose Samsung's current business status and strategy in the DRAM industry, and {{try to find a way}} to create value as a complementor in diverse IT industries. Furthermore, I will try to find opportunities where Samsung ca...|$|E
40|$|Therapy of {{metacarpal}} neck fractures {{depending on}} radiographically measured palmar angulation is discussed controversially in the literature. Some authors describe normal hand function of malunited metacarpal neck fractures with a palmar angulation up to 70 °; others define 30 ° as the <b>uppermost</b> <b>limit</b> to maintain normal hand function. However, {{the methods of}} measuring palmar angulation are not clearly defined. Here, we present a new method to measure palmar angulation using ultrasound. The aim of this prospective study is to compare the radiographic methods of measuring palmar angulation with the ultrasound method. PATIENTS/MATERIAL AND METHOD: 20 patients with a neck fracture of the metacarpals IV or V were treated either conservatively or operatively. 2 weeks after trauma or operation, an x-ray was performed. 2 examiners measured the palmar angulation on the oblique and lateral projections using 2 different methods (medullary canal and dorsal cortex methods). At the same time, the 2 examiners performed measurements of palmar angulation using ultrasound. The measurements obtained with the different methods {{as well as by}} the 2 examiners at 2 different terms were compared. Intra- and interobserver reliability of each method was calculated, and for the ultrasound method a test for accuracy of the measured angles was performed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the anthropometric {{characteristics}} and body composition of wrestlers from the Italian national team. The study was carried out on a sample of 23 wrestlers (9 females and 14 males) aged 1833 years. Various anthropometric measurements were performed (weight, height, sitting height, some girths and skinfold thicknesses) and anthropometric indices calculated (body mass index, cormic index, upper arm muscle area, upper arm fat area, and arm fat index). Body composition was assessed and minimum wrestling weight was determined based on a minimum body fat percentage of 5 % for males and 12 % for females. We undertook comparisons by sex, wrestling style (for males), and weight category. The comparison between men’s and women’s wrestling corroborated known differences between the sexes; the comparison between wrestling styles stressed the relevance of the cormic index. The most interesting finding of this study was that no female wrestler competed in a lower weight class than her minimum wrestling weight, even if all of them were heavier than values allowed for their weight class. Five of 14 male wrestlers competed in a weight class lower than their minimum wrestling weight, and all of them, except two, were heavier than the <b>uppermost</b> <b>limit</b> of their weight class...|$|E
40|$|Elevated liver enzymes {{can be seen}} {{relatively}} {{frequently in}} patients with Turner syndrome (TS), while the pathogenesis of this remains unclear. Our epidemiological and prospective study aimed to investigate : a) the natural 2 -yr course of liver disease in a selected cohort of young patients with TS, who had been preliminarily recruited {{on the basis of}} persistently elevated liver enzymes; b) the role of prolonged hormonal therapies in the etiology of liver dysfunction. From an overall population of 214 TS patients younger than 20 yr, only 19 (8. 9 %) were recruited, according to the following inclusion criteria: increased serum concentrations of one or more liver enzymes, exceeding the <b>uppermost</b> <b>limit</b> of the respective normal ranges, and persistence of these liver alterations for 6 months after the preliminary assessment. On the basis of the results of this prospective study, we can conclude that: a) the prevalence of liver abnormalities in girls and adolescents with TS is much lower and more strictly related to hormonal therapies than in TS adults; b) both autoimmunity and obesity are not frequently involved in the etiology of TS liver dysfunction; c) liver damage is either mild or moderate and its severity is not conditioned by karyotype; d) its course may be self-limiting; e) its natural history may be characterized in some cases by a slight deterioration of intrahepatic cholestasis, with no negative repercussions on liver synthetic function...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a discussion of}} the spectral characteristics of geoid profiles derived from Seasat alitmetry in the South Atlantic. Individual profile spectra are computed and averaged in seven separate geodynamic provinces (Mid-Atlantic Ridge, flanks, Walvis and Rio Grande aseismic ridges, and Argen-tine and Cape basins). Three distinct wavebands can be identified in most spectra. For wavelengths shorter than 35 km the spectra are typical of white noise with a 7 -cm rms amplitude typical of Seasat altimeter measurement noise. For wavelengths between 300 and 800 km (our <b>uppermost</b> <b>limit,</b> since original profiles are 1700 km long) the spectra are in reasonable agreement with Kaula's empirical rule and are compatible with a Pratt (thermal boundary layer) compensation mechanism, with an ill-defined compensation depth of 30 - 60 km. The paper centers on the description of the 35 - 300 km part of the spectra. Computation of an impedance for each province requires good knowledge of its bathymetry, which is far from satisfactory as yet in the South Atlantic. We show that for wavelengths longer than 80 km the squared amplitude spectrum of bathymetry varies as the inverse of wave number. We propose that this relationship might also hold at shorter wavelengths, although it is not observed due to presently insufficient data. Using these spectral estimates, and correcting for the mean depth of the topography, we derive impedance (actually response function) estimates eparately for each province. The data are wel...|$|E
