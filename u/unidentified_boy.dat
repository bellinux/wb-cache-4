50|$|The {{police found}} {{themselves}} trapped {{at the south}} side of the street because a gang of roughs had raised the bridge. In the face of certain death, they were saved when an <b>unidentified</b> <b>boy</b> lowered the bridge for them to escape and, more importantly, for the cavalry to come to their rescue. The cavalry was followed by several large wagons filled with reinforcements. Here, the mob once again turned around and retreated to the other side of the bridge while being fired upon by the police and beaten by their clubs. Many reporters were at the scene of the conflict and they reported the typical clashes of that day consisted of guerrilla warfare, when cavalry or police approached, a crowd would part and then close behind it while many threw stones and pieces of wood and coal.|$|E
5000|$|In 1949, {{a medical}} {{examiner}} from Milwaukee, Wisconsin suggested that investigators felt {{there may have}} been a connection between the <b>unidentified</b> <b>boy</b> and Homer Lemay, a six-year-old who disappeared around the same time the child died. Lemay was said by his father, Edmond, to have died in a vehicle accident during a trip to South America when he was being cared for by family friends (described as the [...] "Nortons"), but there was no existing record of his death. Edmond Lemay stated that he learned of his son's death after receiving information from a South American newspaper that detailed the accident. He also was accused of falsifying his wife's signature while she was missing, but was later found not guilty. Detectives were unable to find any information about such an event or even the existence of the two Nortons.|$|E

50|$|The alleged {{harassment}} {{of family members}} went on {{during the course of}} the search. New York State Troopers supposedly interrogated Wright's five-year-old son at Wheelock Primary School without Wright’s knowledge or permission. Using this testimony and the testimony of an <b>unidentified</b> 10-year-old <b>boy,</b> troopers arrested Wright, Crowe and Richard Catanese, Wright’s boyfriend, on charges of endangering the welfare of a child. Wright's three children, including a three-week-old nursing infant were put into protective custody and Wright was not allowed to see them for four days. Her children were returned a week later. It is believed that the shooting of troopers Baker and Longobardo were the result of Phillip’s anger about his grandchildren being taken away from his daughter.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} ten, Morgan was {{a witness}} to the {{shooting}} death of his father, also a police officer. Left without a father figure, he had behavioral problems as an adolescent and earned himself a juvenile record for fighting. He was taken under the wing of a local youth center coordinator, Carl Buford. Buford acted as a surrogate father to Morgan, helping expunge Morgan's juvenile criminal record and him to obtain the aforementioned football scholarship. Although Morgan was able to avoid going into a life of crime like many of his peers, Buford was also sexually abusing him, a fact which Morgan only admitted years later and under extreme duress. As a teen he discovered the body of an <b>unidentified</b> <b>boy,</b> which {{had a profound effect on}} him (he went door to door in order to collect money to buy the boy a headstone and visited the boy's grave every time he came home to Chicago). Due to his difficult past, he displays little sympathy for unremorseful criminals who attempt to use their traumatic childhood as an excuse for the crimes they commit. Prior to joining the FBI, Morgan served in a bomb squad and was a Chicago PD officer. At one time he spent 18 months doing deep undercover work.|$|E
5000|$|Years later, Morgan's past {{would come}} back to haunt him when he was arrested by the Chicago Police Department for the murder of the <b>unidentified</b> <b>boy</b> and two others. The lead detective, who had arrested Morgan several times for {{juvenile}} misdemeanors when the latter was young, believed Morgan was guilty and used a BAU profile done by Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin) to support his case. Believing he was being framed by the real killer, the BAU searched through Morgan's life and background to prove him innocent, which discomfited Garcia as Morgan had been generally reticent about the details of his past. They later identified Carl Buford as the man who set Morgan up to take the fall (Buford was friends with the lead detective). When Hotch asked about Buford, Morgan told him to back off. He then escaped police custody and spoke to a local boy who was friends with the latest victim. The boy revealed he was currently being molested by Buford and that the latest victim knew about it. Morgan confronted Buford, who at first denied anything happened between them, and told Morgan the other boy was lying. Refusing to back down (and wishing that he had told someone about Buford when he was a kid), Morgan eventually got Buford to admit to the abuse. Buford's admission was overheard by Chicago PD detectives who were laying in wait nearby, and they arrested Buford. Buford pleaded with Morgan to help him, to which Morgan replies, [...] "You go to Hell," [...] leaving the child molester to his fate.|$|E

5000|$|According to King: [...] "Battle damage {{assessment}} conducted {{in support of}} operation Eagle Fury has not indicated any non-combatant casualties to date,"There was a single civilian casualty encountered in Lejay. Upon arrival of the Karzai delegation, 15FEB02, while my team and I escorted them to various surrounding villages, a boy who was approximately twelve years of age was brought out of a residence. The boy's uncle said that the boy had been shot by Americans. Our 18D (Medical Sergeant) was called forward and treated the boy's wound. It could not be ascertained who inflicted the injury. However, according to the uncle, the boy's father had taken him up into the mountains where they remained with others in an <b>unidentified</b> cave. The <b>boy</b> had been injured while collecting fire wood. The boy was MEDIVAC'd less than three hours later to Bagram Air Field for treatment.Between 10FEB02 and 18FEB02, there was a single funeral held IVO Lejay. The body of a Taliban fighter had been recovered from the cave complexes and, {{in accordance with the}} Muslim faith, was buried as soon as possible following death. That particular male had been killed by the concussion created from bombs which had been dropped IVO the cave he was in, due to the blood identified coming from his ears and nose. His body was also black from having been exposed to the harsh temperatures up in the mountains (There was a substantial amount of snow in the region at that time of year).|$|R
