It is the interest of sociologist to investigate the <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> exogamous or mixed marriage between different ethnic groups, as the <b>upward</b> <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> mixed marriage can be view as degree of assimilation of particular ethnic groups.

Grab samples of 18 - 19 years from 1995 to 2014 recorded at outlets of 7 Tallinn watersheds were analysed for monotonic trend through seasonal Mann Kendall test for long-term, short-term, baseflow and stormflow. Statistically significant downward trends (P-value (p) 0. 05 and < 0. 2) for 3 – SS, 1 – BOD, 1 – TN and 1 – TP were identified. Statistically significant long-term <b>upward</b> <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> pH were revealed in 5 basins, which reduced to 2 with 5 less significant <b>upward</b> <b>trends</b> over the 10 year period, indicating improvements in pH reduction. Härjapea has the highest pH without trend but it includes an <b>upward</b> <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> TN at p = 0. 051. The highly possible causes for downward trends are street sweeping, sewer network improvement, decline in sub-urban agricultural areas, etc. The <b>upward</b> <b>trend</b> results <b>of</b> pH are related to increased alkalinisation due to acidic rain, weathering of carbonate rocks, sewage discharge and alkaline road dust. In most of the basins, stormflow has more influence on trends than baseflow...|$|R

Furthermore, since the aggregation rate has a second-order dependency on particle concentration [69], the sample with high MNP concentration has higher tendency to aggregate, leading to the formation of large particle clusters.

Since the 90 's an <b>upward</b> <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> incidence has been observed in the Czech Republic again. There was an age shift from the group of youngest childern toward older childern, adolescents and adults. The highest increase in pertusis cases occured in 10 - 14 year- olds.

We distinguish between the several corporate holding-groups that dominate the ‘Big Economy’ and the multitude of smaller, largely independent, business entities of the ‘Small Economy’. Although the two “sectors” operate under the same macroeconomic conditions, the analysis reveals marked differences in their business performance. These differences were reflected in an <b>upward</b> <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> aggregate concentration through the 1964 - 1968 period. Until the early 1970 s the <b>upward</b> <b>trend</b> was moderate and was largely due to the different expansion paces of the two “sectors”. Since then, however, the trend intensified as the ‘Small Economy’ stagnated while profits in the ‘Big Economy’ continued to grow. ...|$|R
