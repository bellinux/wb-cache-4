5|$|On June 30, 2004, then-Mayor Newsom {{pledged to}} fix San Francisco’s {{homeless}} problem within 10 years and clear downtown streets of its widespread homeless population. He stated {{that people who}} were homeless and seriously ill would be given shelter. After 10 years and $1.5 billion, the city relocated 19,500 people off the streets, with 11,363 single adults being housed, and 8,086 people {{being sent to the}} home of a willing family member or friend though the Homeward Bound program.

The percentage of the homeless population in jail was cut in half between 2005 and 2013, which is an indicator that some of the homeless population who would have ended <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> were now being housed and treated.|$|E

50|$|It’s clear, how {{difficult}} is for our society to understand motives and acts of people, which have ended <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>jails.</b> Many prisoners are not classical victims with the pure past and clear future.

But they also as other citizens of our country have rights guaranteed by the UN Declaration {{of human rights and}} the Constitution of Belarus. Nobody has rights to torture, to beat, to kill, to humiliate human advantage, to violate none. More over lawful representatives of the society on behalf of law enforcement bodies should not turn punishment into crime.|$|R
