5|$|In the United States, the {{production}} and consumption of Mozzarella and pizza cheese steadily increased in the mid-20th century, and this trend has continued into {{the first decade of}} the 21st century. In the U.S., several hundred million pounds of pizza cheese is consumed annually. In 1997, it was estimated that annual production of the product was 1 million tons (2 billion pounds) in the United States and 100,000 tonnes (98,000 long tons; 110,000 short tons, 220,460,000 pounds) in Europe. It has been estimated that 30% of all pizza cheese <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States is Mozzarella cheese. As of 2000, demand for the product was growing in Europe by 8 percent per year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, the primary legal test <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States to {{determine}} if speech could be criminalized was the bad tendency test. Rooted in English common law, the test permitted speech to be outlawed if it {{had a tendency to}} harm public welfare. One of the earliest cases in which the Supreme Court addressed punishment after material was published was Patterson v. Colorado (1907) in which the Court used the bad tendency test to uphold contempt charges against a newspaper publisher who accused Colorado judges of acting on behalf of local utility companies.|$|E
5|$|Over 50% of MS {{patients}} may use complementary and alternative medicine, although numbers vary greatly {{depending on the}} definition of alternative medicine <b>used.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, {{it is estimated that}} 75% of the MS patient populations use at least one complementary and alternative medicine for treatment and symptomatic control. The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. The rationale behind the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D.|$|E

5|$|The apothecaries' {{system or}} apothecaries' weights and {{measures}} is a historical system of mass and volume units that were used by physicians and apothecaries for medical recipes, and also sometimes by scientists. The English version {{of the system is}} closely related to the English troy system of weights, the pound and grain being exactly the same in both. It divides a pound into 12 ounces, an ounce into 8 drachms, and a drachm into 3 scruples or 60 grains. This exact form of the system was <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom; in some of its former colonies it survived well into the 20th century. The apothecaries' system of measures is a similar system of volume units based on the fluid ounce. For a long time, medical recipes were written in Latin, often using special symbols to denote {{weights and measures}}.|$|E
5|$|Variations {{are also}} found with the {{spelling}} of unit names in countries using the same language, including differences in American English and British spelling. For example, meter and liter are <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States whereas metre and litre are used in other English-speaking countries. In addition, the official US spelling for the rarely used SI prefix for ten is deka. In American English the term metric ton is the normal usage whereas in other varieties of English tonne is common. Gram is also sometimes spelled gramme in English-speaking countries other than the United States, though this older usage is declining.|$|E

5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} and California {{sea lions}} were <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) to detect mines, protect ships from enemy soldiers, and recover objects. The Navy has never trained attack dolphins, {{as they would}} not be able to discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers. There were five marine mammal teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (dolphins), MK5 (sea lions), MK6 (dolphins and sea lions), MK7 (dolphins), and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column, because dolphins can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who would have to make multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from enemy divers, and was operational in the Gulf War and Vietnam War. The dolphins would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. Sea lions would hand-cuff the enemy, and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.|$|E
5|$|The 12"/50 was a Bethlehem development. It {{was most}} likely based on the weapon <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States' , the 12"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun. The twelve guns were mounted in six twin turrets. Four turrets were superfiring fore and aft, while {{the other two were}} located en echelon in wing turrets. The latter weapons could, in theory, fire on a ° range on their {{respective}} sides of the hull and ° on the other, but in reality this was not possible, as the blast damage from the weapons would damage the ship. A more reasonable estimate would be ° on their sides. The 6-inch secondary armament was placed in casemates, with six {{on either side of the}} ship. For protection, they were provided with 6inches of armor. The 4-inch weaponry, intended for use against marauding destroyers, was mounted unarmored in various places around the ship, including the main deck, superstructure, and far up near the bow. As originally built, there were sixteen 4-inch guns, but four of those were replaced with four 3-inch AA guns and four 3-pounders during the 1924-1926 modernization. The torpedo tubes were located underneath the waterline and were loaded in a dedicated compartment.|$|E
5|$|The methods {{through which}} {{tropical}} cyclones are forecast have {{changed with the}} passage of time. The first known forecasts in the Western Hemisphere were made by Lt. Col. William Reed of the Corps of Royal Engineers at Barbados in 1847. Reed mostly utilized barometric pressure measurements as the basis of his forecasts. Benito Vines introduced a forecast and warning system based on cloud cover changes in Havana during the 1870s. Before the early 1900s, though, most forecasts were done by direct observations at weather stations, which were then relayed to forecast centers via telegraph. It wasn’t until the advent of radio {{in the early twentieth century}} that observations from ships at sea were available to forecasters. The 1930s saw the usage of radiosondes in tropical cyclone forecasting. The next decade saw the advent of aircraft-based reconnaissance by the military, starting with the first dedicated flight into a hurricane in 1943, and the establishment of the Hurricane Hunters in 1944. In the 1950s, coastal weather radars began to be <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, and research reconnaissance flights by the precursor of the Hurricane Research Division began in 1954.|$|E
