5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> how to behave.|$|E

5|$|An implant {{is tested}} between 8 and 24 weeks to {{determine}} if it is integrated.

5|$|As {{feathers}} grow at variable rates, these variations lead to visible {{dark and}} light bands in the fully formed feather. These so-called growth bars and their widths have been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the daily nutritional status of birds.

The guide presents {{suggestions on how to}} make these ideas more understandable, and provides three exercises that can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate radioactive decay.
