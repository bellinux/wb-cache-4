40|$|This paper {{covers the}} developments, {{initiatives}} {{and evolution of}} institutions in the EU-Mediterranean relationship, focuses on {{the objectives of the}} Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Union for the Mediterranean. The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, based on three different fields of action -politics and security, economy and finance, society and culture, has constituted the central framework of relations between the EU and its Southern Mediterranean partners, since 1995. The two different policy frameworks to deal with the Mediterranean -the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, a region-building approach and the European Neighbourhood Policy, a bilateral approach, were complemented with the Union for the Mediterranean, a new framework aimed to <b>upgrade</b> the Euro-Mediterranean <b>Partnership.</b> The paper analyzes, also, the role of Spain in the developments of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, and presents short observations of the first EU-Morocco Summit.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Thai-Japanese relations through {{analysis of}} EPA. There are two questions. The first involves {{the features of}} JTEPA as an EPA. By scrutinizing {{the features of the}} EPA, we would like to approach the institutional framework of the “new era” which will be brought about by JTEPA. The second question is how did the governments of Thailand and Japan come to conclude JTEPA? By reviewing the focal points of the negotiations, we will describe the background of the formation and aims of JTEPA. Finally, we conclude that JTEPA is a culmination of the existing Thai-Japanese relations, and was built based upon the existing divergence of economic institutions. At the same time it <b>upgrades</b> the bilateral <b>partnership</b> to a framework for multilateral cooperation by considering assistance toward Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar and Vietnam. The author would like to emphasize that JTEPA was designed based on the idea of a further integration of CLMV and Thailand, an original member of ASEAN...|$|R
40|$|While {{entering}} {{into a deep}} confrontation with the West {{in the context of}} the Ukrainian crisis, Russia has sought to uphold its international profile by <b>upgrading</b> its strategic <b>partnership</b> with China and adding new economic content to it, first of all in energy deals. At the same time, Moscow is aware of the risks related to becoming a minor partner to powerful China and to diminishing its ability to make its own contributions to forming the global agenda. One way of avoiding too much dependence on Chinese patronage would be to retain and cultivate the traditional ties with Vietnam and perhaps even play a pacifying role in the oscillating Chinese-Vietnamese tensions. Russian energy companies are exploring opportunities for further advancing offshore oil and gas projects in the South China Sea, although the profitability of these projects remains rather low. Russia has delivered two out of six contracted Kilo class submarines to Vietnam, but its role as the main provider of weapons may now be challenged by the USA and Japan. The prospects for maintaining or expanding Russia’s security and energy connections with Vietnam is thus a demanding topic for analysis, which may throw light also on the all-important trilateral relationship between China, the USA and Japan.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} framework, 'accountable bureaucratic capacity' is utilised {{to investigate}} the ability of local government to institutionalise collaborative urban <b>upgrading</b> measures in <b>partnership</b> with civil society organisations. The main argument is that the latter cannot contribute to sustainable development, democratisation or to protect citizens' rights in low-income neighbourhood without accountable representation from their side, a reciprocal and active representation from the citizens concerned, and an accountable public sector. The capacity of urban governance {{and the extent to}} which participatory initiatives can exploit the potential within existing structures and systems are examined. This examination allows an evaluation of how far a participatory project rated as 'good-practice' can enhance citizens' awareness of opportunities, political participation and local government performance, while building collaborative and institutionalised planning capacity. The research concludes that the sustainability of urban upgrading depends on the form of citizens' participation and the management styles of cities. Successful participation during an upgrading project may have 'transformative' potential to encourage citizens' political participation. If the citizens are not active, even though they reject the government's development agenda, or have to depend on 'informal' networks to provide their needs, they may be characterised as 'free-riders', who withdraw from urban governance and its collaborative decision-making processes. Legal recognition of squatter settlements is the first step required to institutionalise upgrading policies, particularly for indigenous or customary groups trying to survive in a world characterised by increasing interdependence and escalating threats to local ties. However, although this recognition strengthens a group's ability to negotiate and interact with non-group members, it may also have detrimental effects if it is not supported by additional legislation. Local government needs institutional reform and a strategic capacity-building programme to forge partnerships and the joint responsibility of the public and private sectors, as well as of civil society...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{fatalities}} {{have occurred}} in the sport of evening over the last number of years. An increased risk of falling has been reported based on fence design (Murray et al., 2004 b, Murray et al. 2005, Stachurska et al., 2010), rider knowledge of leading the competition and their perception of pace prior to the fall (Murray et al., 2004 b). No research to date has considered the competition profile of the horse, the rider and the horse & rider partnership. The aim of this research was to explore the competition profile of all cross-country falls in Eventing Ireland (EI) competitions in the 2011 to 2014 seasons, by analysing the number of cross country starters, number of fallers, competition level, type-of-fall (rider fall/ horse fall). Competition profile variables analysed included: upgrading horse, <b>upgrading</b> rider, new <b>partnership,</b> new season, cross-country penalties prior to fall, cross country profile of horse. There were 27, 176 cross-country starts and 643 falls recorded in the timeframe (1 fall per every 42 starters). There was variation in the frequency and type of falls across competition levels, with a higher instance of rider falls in Junior (2. 0 %) and Amateur (1. 8 %) level competition and a higher instance of horse falls in CNC 2 (0. 9 %) level competition. Of all falls, 40 % involved an upgrading horse, 24 % involved an upgrading rider, 36 % involved a new partnership and 51 % were starting a new competitive season. In an attempt {{to reduce the risk of}} cross-country falls and while further research is warranted, these findings would indicate a need for better preparation/training of horses and riders prior to upgrading, when establishing new partnerships and in advance of starting their competitive eventing season...|$|R
40|$|Based at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's {{largest and}} most {{powerful}} particle accelerator. From 2025, the LHC will be upgraded {{to allow it to}} achieve a factor of 10 higher luminosity, which increases the rate of collisions, essential for probing new physics phenomena in the future. The route to high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) involves various detector upgrades and requires significant infrastructure changes. Recent measurements by CERN Radiation Protection, verifying previous calculations by The University of Sheffield (UoS), has raised awareness about the need to restrict human activity in the HLLHC experimental, construction and maintenance areas due to exposure from high levels of radiation. Examining the case of the ATLAS detector <b>upgrade,</b> the collaborative <b>partnership</b> between UoS and UK industry is developing state-of-the-art robotic instrumentation, capable of tolerating high radiation levels. The main object of this research is a feasibility study with a TRL (technology readiness level) of three, to determine how materials and sub components of dexterous robotic systems behave after exposure to high levels of radiation. This is evaluation uses novel robotic irradiation equipment, techniques and test methods housed in the Birmingham University (UK) Irradiation Facility. One finger of an unmodified Shadow Robot Company “Hand”, a highly dexterous robotic manipulator, was exposed to specific doses of high radiation in a temperature controlled thermal chamber. Cooled by a liquid nitrogen evaporative system, the irradiation system moves samples continuously through a homogeneous proton beam. Movement is provided by a radiation hard pre-configured XY-Axis Cartesian Robot. The methods and techniques developed {{as a result of this}} TRL 3 research will further aid the application and deployment of robotic and autonomous systems into highly radioactive environments. Based on preliminary findings it has been concluded that finger materials and basic electrical components can tolerate hazardous radiation environments, with careful selection and substitution of a minimal amount of materials, radiation hardness is also possible. Further work is scheduled for the irradiation of a fully instrumented and powered robotic hand to determine working hour tolerance. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{invitation}} to the international community to participate in the usage and a substantial upgrade of the Dutch Open Telescope on La Palma (DOT, [URL] We first give a brief overview of the approach, design, and current science capabilities of the DOT. It became a successful 0. 2 -arcsec-resolution solar movie producer through its combination of (i) an excellent site, (ii) effective wind flushing through the fully open design and construction of both the 45 -cm telescope and the 15 -m support tower, (iii) special designs which produce extraordinary pointing stability of the tower, equatorial mount, and telescope, (iv) simple and excellent optics with minimum wavefront distortion, and (v) largevolume speckle reconstruction including narrow-band processing. The DOT’s multi-camera multi-wavelength speckle imaging system samples the solar photosphere and chromosphere simultaneously in various optical continua, the G band, Ca IIH (tunable throughout the blue wing), and Hα (tunable throughout the line). The resulting DOT data sets are all public. The DOT database ([URL] now contains many tomographic image sequences with 0. 2 - 0. 3 arcsec resolution and up to multi-hour duration. You are welcome to pull them over for analysis. The main part of this contribution outlines DOT upgrade designs implementing larger aperture. The motivation for aperture increase is the recognition that optical solar physics needs the substantially larger telescope apertures that became useful with the advent of adaptive optics and viable through the DOT’s open principle, both for photospheric polarimetry at high resolution and high sensitivity and for chromospheric fine-structure diagnosis at high cadence and full spectral sampling. Our upgrade designs for the DOT are presented in an incremental sequence of five options of which the simplest (Option I) achieves 1. 4 m aperture using the present tower, mount, fold-away canopy, and multi-wavelength speckle imaging and processing systems. The most advanced (Option V) offers unblocked 2. 5 m aperture in an off-axis design with a large canopy, a wide 30 -m high support tower, and image transfer to a groundbased optics lab for advanced instrumentation. All five designs employ adaptive optics. The important advantages of fully open, wind-transparent and wind-flushed structure, polarimetric constancy, and absence of primary-image rotation remain. All designs are relatively cheap through re-using as much of the existing DOT hardware as possible. Realization of an <b>upgrade</b> requires external <b>partnership(s).</b> This report about DOT upgrade options therefore serves also as initial documentation for potential partners...|$|R
