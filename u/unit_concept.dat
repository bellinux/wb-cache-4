5|$|Following {{the demise}} of German naval power in the Pacific the fleet <b>unit</b> <b>concept</b> was no longer seen as being relevant, and Australia {{did not have a}} clear role. As a result, post-war budget cuts {{prompted}} the RAN to take the battlecruiser out of active service, as the large share of resources and manpower consumed by Australia could be better used elsewhere in the RAN. In August 1920 the battlecruiser was rated by the Naval Board as 11th out of the RAN's 12 priorities. Accordingly, the ship's company was reduced later that year and she was assigned to Flinders Naval Depot as a gunnery and torpedo training ship. In the event of a major conflict, Australia was to serve in a role akin to coastal artillery. She was not considered to have been placed in reserve at this time, however, as it was not possible for the RAN to provide a trained complement at short notice.|$|E

Most of the search engines are using traditional IR methods based on keyword matching and are already showing a number of limitations, particularly they suffer from low precision. One suggestion for improving their performance is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to support content-based IR. However, current NLP technology is not mature enough to enable free text parsing and understanding. This research focuses on searching semi-structured documents, such as Web pages generated from databases and online services. Shallow NLP and a knowledgebased approach is used to parse both users' query and semi-structured documents to a set of knowledge <b>units</b> (<b>concepts)</b> and the knowledge <b>units</b> (<b>concepts)</b> are used as the basis for matching instead of keywords.

In response to the lack of these concepts in the Egyptian secondary school Physics curriculum, the current study aim at integrating some Nanotechnology concepts and applications in this curriculum and seek to answer this question: What “nanotechnology concepts and applications ” should be teach in the secondary school Physics curriculum in Egypt. To do that, the researchers analyzed the content of Physics curricula in some countries and in the three grades of secondary education in Egypt for the school year 2014 - 2015, and prepared a list of 52 nanotechnology concepts, to be integrated in the secondary-stage Physics curriculum. These concepts were distributed along five basic units (the first <b>unit</b> included 20 <b>concepts,</b> the second <b>unit</b> 11 <b>concepts,</b> the third and fourth <b>units</b> 8 <b>concepts</b> each, and the fifth <b>unit</b> 5 <b>concepts).</b> On the other hand, twenty one concepts of nanotechnology were integrated into the second-grade secondary school Physics curriculum, distributed along three units (Units one and two included nine <b>concepts</b> whereas <b>unit</b> three included three concepts).

The <b>Unit</b> Cell <b>concept</b> will test only a 15. 24 cm by 15. 24 cm portion of a full sized prototype coil, to predict airside and heat transfer performance. This reduction in prototype size will allow for reduced costs and time for researching and development of heat exchangers. To validate a working model of the <b>Unit</b> Cell <b>concept,</b> a testing apparatus and procedure has been developed to test the small sized coils. Tests have shown that pressure drop across the Unit Cell coil can be matched within 6. 27 % and overall heat transfer can be matched within 6. 37 % of the full sized standard coil.

50|$|According to the 'time-is-brain' {{concept in}} acute stroke, recanalization of the {{obstructed}} blood vessels {{has to be}} performed within the very first hours after symptom onset.
