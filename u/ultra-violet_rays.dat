25|$|The storage {{condition}} of the bottled wine will influence a wine's aging. Vibrations and heat fluctuations can hasten a wine's deterioration and cause adverse effect on the wines. In general, a wine has a greater potential to develop complexity and more aromatic bouquet if it is allowed to age slowly in a relatively cool environment. The lower the temperature, the more slowly a wine develops. On average, the rate of chemical reactions in wine double with each 18°F (8°C) increase in temperature. Wine expert Karen MacNeil recommends keeping wine intended for aging in a cool area with a constant temperature around 55°F (13°C). Wine can be stored at temperatures as high as 69°F (20°C) without long term negative effect. Professor Cornelius Ough of the University of California, Davis believes that wine could be exposed to temperatures as high as 120°F (49°C) {{for a few hours}} and not be damaged. However, most experts believe that extreme temperature fluctuations (such as repeated transferring a wine from a warm room to a cool refrigerator) would be detrimental to the wine. The <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>rays</b> of direct sunlight should also be avoided because of the free radicals that can develop in the wine and result in premature oxidation.|$|E

40|$|In 1953 the metachromatic {{reaction}} of urine (abbrevi a ted to MR) was discovered and designated by Nagata and Yamamoto. Since then {{studies on the}} MR {{have been carried out}} by their coworkers and the number of their reports has already totalled to dozens. This paper deals with the results of studies which have recently been made on the physiochemical effects on the MR. As material, the uri n e specimens of healthy persons and patients with urogenital disease were used. The urine specimens were subjected to the MR test. The MR test was performed on the same urine specimens after such physio-chemical procedures as heating, cooling, infrared <b>ray</b> irradiation, <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>ray</b> irradiation, x-ray irradiation, centrifugation, desiccation by refrigeration, treatment with absorbents and ion exchange resins and dialysis. The results of the MR test were compared with those obtained before the procedures were performed. The results were interpreted macroscopically after the manner of Nagata and Yamamoto. A part of the results was interpreted colorimetrically according to the method of Yamamoto et al. Results : 1) The effects of intrared ray irradiation. While intrared ray irradiatio n for 60 - 120 minutes produced no special change in the results of the MR test on the urine specimens which developed the negative MR, the urine specimens which showed positive or doubtful positive results to the MR test were negative in 4 out of the. 5 cases and doubtful positive in 1. 2) The effects of ultraviolet ray irradiation. In the case of ultraviolet ray i rradiation there was no change in the results of the MR test on the urine of all the cases, regardless of the time of irradiation. 3) The effects of x-ray irradiation When the urine speci m ens were irradiated with x-rays, there occurred no change in the results of the MR test on all the cases, irrespective of the time and dosage of irradiation. 4) The effects of temperature. The urine speci m ens which showed positive and doubtful positive results to the MR test rendered the MR negative when they were heated to 100 °C for 60 minutes. There was no change in the results of the MR test on the other urine specimens that were negative. On heating at 90 °C for 60 minutes, the MR-positive urine specimens of 3 cases were negative in all the 3 cases; the MR-doubtful positive urine specimens of 2 cases were negative in 1 of the 2 cases; the MR-negative urine specimens of 2 cases were negative in 1 out of the 2 cases. At a low temperature of 0 ° to. 40 °C, there was no change in the results of the MR test, irrespective of the number of cooling days. 5) The effects of centrifugation and desiccation by refrigeration Centrifugation at 3000 - 5000 rpm caused no change in the results of the MR test on the urine specimens of all the cases. There was no change in the results of the MR test on the urine specimens which were allowed to stand at room temperature for 6 months after they were frozen to dryness. 6) The effects of absorbents. The MR-positive urine spe c imens were absorbed in to silica and activated charcoal and showed negative results to the MR test. However, there was no change in the MR test on the negative urine specimens. 7) The effects of ion exchange resins. IRA- 400 and IRC- 50 rendered the MR of the MR-positive urine specimens doubtful positive, while the negative urine specimens were caused by IR- 120 and IRA- 400 to show positive results to the MR test. 8) The effects of dialysis. Positive results were obtained by dialysis in the greater part of 312 healthy persons and patients. Though dialysis brought about a marked decrease in or a disappearance of electrolytes, changes in the electrolytes did not influence the results of the MR test. Colorimetery {{of the results of the}} MR test after dialysis revealed a movement toward the left lower part from the original point of the CIE chromaticity diagram. This was due to a decrease in purity and an increase in luminocity. The MR-positive urine specimens also showed the same tendency, which was particularly remarkable in the MRnegative urine specimens. In such a case the results of the MR test cannot be interpreted macroscopically and therefore a colorimetric method seems to be the only one used for that interpretation...|$|R

The color that the transparent emulsion is stained prevents the passage of a substantial amount of blue and green light through the film to act upon the panchromatic film on the back. Over the next eight years, Brewster filed a series of further patents pertaining to photographic film, film development, color cinematography, and various improvements to the process.

First, the initial concentration of amino acids in surface environment after cometary impact was estimated. The effect of hydrothermal vents, <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>rays,</b> and clays was taken into consideration. Next, the absorption of amino acids by clay particles before degradation by ultra-violet light was analyzed. Finally, the effectiveness of clays, ultra-violet, and hydrothermal vents as sinks for cometary amino acids was compared.

The reported relative thickness distribution of tillites and diamicites of all ages agrees with the thickness calculated from this impact model. This suggests that many of the ancient tillites and diamicites could be of impact origin. The effectiveness of comets was explored on the chemical evolution of amino acids. The effect of sinks such as clays, submarine vents, and UV light on amino acid concentration was considered.

The results in brief are as follows : 1) The cells fluoresced most vividly in the severest stages of diseases (inflammation, neo-plasma etc.). The results in vitro were more reliable than in vivo. 2) The degree of fluorescence depends upon the vitality of cells and not on whether they are live or dead. 3) Fluorescein diffuses into the cells, and is absorbed to a great degree by the cell membranes. The degree, the strength of fluorescing depends upon this absorption of the cell membranes. 4) There is no apparent relationship between the pH value of the specimens and the degree of fluorescing. 5) Sodium fluorescein may be considered as non toxic. 6) Many investigators (G. E. Moore, D. M. Shapiro et al.) have reported in the past that fluorescein injected intravenously remained longer in neoplastic, inflammatory and necrotic tissues, than those in normal conditions.
