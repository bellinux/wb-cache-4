40|$|Air {{quality is}} a serious concern for the {{protection}} of human health and our natural environment. The pollutants contributing the most to both local and transboundary air pollution problems are SO 2, NOx, NH 3, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and fine particulate mater (PM), and mostly originate from the same sources as greenhouse gases. There are thus strong interactions between strategies designed to improve air quality and those addressing climate change. This article examines these interactions, and the benefits of combined strategies with greater attention to the overall environmental impacts, and finding the 'win-win' solutions.

30|$|Background, aim and scopeSince 1990 the <b>UN</b> <b>ECE</b> Heavy Metals in Mosses Surveys provide data {{inventories}} of the atmospheric heavy metal bioaccumulation across Europe. In the survey 2005 the nitrogen accumulation was measured {{for the first}} time in most of the participating countries. In Germany, the surveys were conducted in close cooperation of the relevant authorities of both the Federal Republic and the sixteen states. Therefore, statistical evaluations of the moss survey data with regard to the whole German territory and single federal states are of interest. This article concentrates on Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, dealing with the mapping of the spatiotemporal trends of metal accumulation from 1990 to 2005, the spatial patterns of nitrogen accumulation in 2005, and the spatial variability of bioaccumulation due to characteristics of the sampling sites and their surroundings.|$|R

This Vademecum is designed to provide guidance to those responsible for calculating and mapping critical loads, critical levels, and exceedances on a national or regional scale. The chemical criteria and recommended methods to calculate critical loads and levels are described, together with elaboration of the chemical formulas to be used.

30|$|Background, aim {{and scope}} Since 1990, the <b>UN</b> <b>ECE</b> Heavy Metals in Mosses Surveys provide data {{inventories}} of the atmospheric heavy metal bioaccumulation across national boundaries in Europe. The results prove how air pollution control in Germany and in all of Europe affected the bioaccumulation of metals in those ecosystems that are not directly influenced by nearby emission sources. This article focuses on the assessment of spatiotemporal patterns of the metal bioaccumulation in Germany since 1990. Furthermore, the spatial variance of the metal bioaccumulation is analysed with regard to sampling site-specific and regional land characteristics. Special focus hereby relies on the correlation of the metal concentration in mosses and in depositions. Hence, the moss surveys contribute to §[*] 12 of the German Federal Nature Conservation Act {{as well as to}} the “Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution” (CLRTAP).|$|R
50|$|In 1958, {{under the}} auspices of the United Nations, a {{consortium}} called the Economic Commission for Europe had been established to commonize vehicle regulations across Europe so as to standardize best practices in vehicle design and equipment and minimize technical barriers to pan-European vehicle trade and traffic. This eventually became the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, which began to promulgate what would eventually become the <b>UN's</b> <b>ECE</b> Regulations on vehicle design, construction, and safety performance. Although most of the world's countries accept or require ECE-compliant vehicles—either as official signatories to ECE regulations or by national regulations effectively identical to ECE—the United States, virtually alone in the world, has declined to join the forum or accept ECE regulations, and blocks the importation of vehicles built to international ECE Regulations rather than the U.S. safety regulations.|$|R

40|$|NICHT ANGEGEBENThe {{aim of this}} master’s thesis ist to {{investigate}} the practicability and usability of mobile GIS applications in a selected real-world scenario in the field. Therefore the important questions are how to provide correct geospatial positioning values and how to support the gathering of useful data in extreme field situations by implementing a mobile GIS prototype. The whole project discussed in this thesis was initiated by the “Institute of Distributed and Multimedia Systems” (Faculty of Computer Sciences) through the “Austrian GRID” initiative in a close collaboration with the Umweltbundesamt, the “Federal Environment Agency of Austria”. An environmental observation area in the national park “Northern Calcareous Alps” in Upper Austria, called „Zöbelboden“ was chosen to test the accuracy of GPS signals and according positioning data in forested or mountainous areas {{as well as to}} study the advantages and benefits of using mobile devices in outdoor situations and free nature. This area, a part of the <b>UN</b> <b>ECE’s</b> Integrated Monitoring Programme, is used for long-term environmental data in selected observation areas. Exactly this project is a multi-disciplinary International Cooperative Programme (ICP) on Integrated Monitoring (IM) of Air Pollution Effects on Ecosystems, which covers regions of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (<b>UN</b> <b>ECE).</b> In this master thesis a prototype will be introduced which allows capturing the desired ecological data digitally using a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). An easy-to-use application based on ESRI’s ArcPad Application Developer has been developed for use on Windows Mobile PocketPCs which integrates the Umweltbundesamt’s own ESRI data layers. Thus, the mobile device is prepared for data integration into a data GRID infrastructure of the Umweltbundesamt. This new prototype is a GPS-assisted client, which enables location-awareness and further allows mobile users to augment the collected data with comments, digital photos, digital audio, or even small movies of artifacts, like trees and other plants. All digitally collected data by the mobile workers can be easily transferred to the Umweltbundesamt’s currently used ecological information system MORIS (a relational database) ...|$|R

Focusing on these processes, one observes a growing importance of datacommunication as a supporting tool. On the determination side of the land administration process (input), strategic objectives such as faster services to the fast moving property market and to the public administration (tax offices, planning authorities) become possible by offering facilities for electronic conveyancing and easy map updating. Electronic conveyancing techniques such as electronic signatures, encryption, hash values, measures against bit-loss, are applied increasingly.

40|$|The {{workshop}} of 'Effects-Based Approaches for Heavy Metals', held in October 1999 in Schwerin, Germany, {{marked a}} further milestone {{in the development}} of calculation methods to derive effects-based critical limits and critical loads for these air pollutants. This activity continued initial steps of the first such workshop under the <b>UN</b> <b>ECE</b> Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution in Bad Harzburg, 1997. While the first protocol for the control of Heavy Metals (Aarhus; Denmark, 1998) is based on best available technology (BAT) and on the emission principle, present knowledge facilitates the application of effects-based approaches to protect the environment and human health in a sustainable way, analogous to the critical load concept for acidification, eutrophication and tropospheric ozone pollution, making such approaches available for eventual deliberations towards a future second step protocol.
