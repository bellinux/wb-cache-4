40|$|Cationic photopolymerization of {{multifunctional}} epoxides is {{very useful}} for efficient cure {{at room temperature}} and has been widely used in coatings and adhesives. Despite excellent properties of the final cured polymers, cationic photopolymerizations of epoxides have seen limited application due to slow reactions (relative to acrylates) and brittleness associated with a highly crosslinked, rigid network. To address these issues, two reaction systems were studied in this thesis: photoinitiated cationic copolymerizations of a cycloaliphatic diepoxide with epoxidized elastomers and acrylate/epoxide hybrid photopolymerizations. Oligomer/monomer structures, viscosity, compositions, and photoinitiator system were hypothesized to play important roles in controlling photopolymerizations of the epoxide-based mixtures. A fundamental understanding of the interplay between these variables for the chosen systems will provide comprehensive guidelines for the future development of photopolymerization systems comparable to the epoxide-based mixtures in this research. For diepoxide/oligomer mixtures, the observed overall enhancement in polymerization rate and ultimate conversion of the cycloaliphatic diepoxide was attributed to the activated monomer mechanism associated with hydroxyl terminal groups in the epoxidized oligomers. This enhancement increased with increasing oligomer content. The mixture viscosity influenced the initial reactivity of the diepoxide for oligomer content above 50 wt. %. Real-time consumption of internal epoxides in the oligomers was successfully determined using Raman spectroscopy. Initial reactivity and ultimate conversion of the internal epoxides decreased with increasing the diepoxide content. This trend was more pronounced for the oligomer containing low internal epoxide content. These {{results indicate that the}} reactivity of the hydroxyl groups is higher toward cationic active centers of the diepoxide than those of the internal epoxides in the oligomers. These conclusions are consistent with physical property results. The enhanced fracture toughness and impact resistance were attributed to multimodal network chain-length distribution of copolymers containing the oligomer content between 70 % and 80 %. For acrylate/epoxide hybrid mixtures, diacrylate oligomers significantly suppressed reactivities of cycloaliphatic mono/diepoxides, which was attributed to high mixture viscosity and highly crosslinked acrylate network. In this case, the dual photoinitiator system did not favor the epoxide reaction. Depending on the monovinyl acrylate secondary functionalities, enhanced reactivity and ultimate conversion of the diepoxide were attributed to a combined effect of a reduced viscosity and the radical-promoted cationic polymerization associated with the dual photoinitiator. The retarded and inhibited diepoxide reactivities with ether and urethane secondary groups were attributed to solvation and nucleophilicity/basicity effects, respectively. The influence of the diepoxide on the acrylate reactivity was attributed to dilution and polarity effects. In this case, high concentration of the free-radical photoinitiator is required for the dual photoinitiator system. Physical properties of hybrid polymers also varied with acrylate structures and monomer composition. Dynamic modulation methods were proposed to enhance the diepoxide reactivity and final properties in the presence of <b>urethane</b> <b>acrylates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Polyurethanes (PUs) {{are finding}} {{increasing}} application and use in many industries {{due to their}} advantageous properties, such as {{a wide range of}} flexibility combined with toughness, high chemical resistance, excellent weatherability, and very low temperature cure. PUs do however have some disadvantages, for instance, PU is considered an expensive polymer, especially when considered for solvent based adhesives. A motivation for this study was to consider a largely unstudied area of PU chemistry by combining PUs with polyacrylates. Polyacrylates are well known adhesives and can carry specific functionality, but have the disadvantage that their flexible backbones impart limited thermal stability and mechanical strength. In this study PU was incorporated into acrylates in an effort to obtain acrylate-g-urethanes with good properties. The mode of incorporation chosen was urethane macromonomers (UMs), a hardly mentioned substance in literature, yet one deserving investigation. UMs having different urethane chain lengths (X) were synthesized by the polyaddition polymerization of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and ethylene glycol (EG) by the prepolymer method, which was terminated by 2 -hydroxy ethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and isopropanol. The UMs were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), proton NMR (1 H NMR), carbon NMR (13 C NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Various percentages of the respective UMs (0 - 40 wt % according to acrylate monomers) were then incorporated into methyl methacrylate (MMA) and into normal butyl methacrylate (n-BMA) backbones via solution free radical copolymerization. The resulting methyl methacrylate-urethane graft copolymers (PMMA-g-urethane) and normal butyl methacrylate-urethane graft copolymers (n-PBMA-g-urethane) were characterized by GPC, 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR, FTIR, TGA, and DMA. Phase separation between the <b>urethane</b> segment and <b>acrylate</b> segment in the yield of graft copolymerization products was investigated by DMA and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As the concentration of the UMs in the free radical copolymerization feed increased, lower yields of both graft copolymers PMMA-g-urethane and n-PBMA-g-urethane were observed and more UM was incorporated into the PMMA and n-PBMA backbones. It also was found that the thermal stability of the PMMA-g-urethane and n-PBMA-gurethane copolymers increased with increasing UM concentration. DMA results showed that in most graft copolymer products the two respective component parts of PMMA-g-urethane or n-PBMA-g-urethane were completely compatible as only one Tg was observed. Two glass transitions, at temperatures of 22. 0 and 76. 0 oC, corresponding to the n-PBMA and urethane moieties, were observed when the chain length of the UMs was increased from X= 4 to X= 32 [the amount of this UM used in the copolymerization feed was increased to 40 %, and microphase separation was indicated]...|$|R

HBPUA was prepared by reacting HBP- 1 resin with diisocyanate and hydroxyl-containing acrylate monomer {{with the presence of}} 0. 1 - 2 wt % dibutyltin dilaurate as a catalyst. The reaction was confirmed by several analytical data i. e. hydroxyl value (OHV), Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analyses. The HBPUA was easily curable when subjected to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

40|$|In {{this work}} it is {{suggested}} to modify trimethylolpropane ethoxylate triacrylate (TMPETA) with solvent born difunctional <b>urethane</b> <b>acrylate</b> oligomer (UA) of hyperbranched structure and high molecular weight. In this case the photopolymer composition initial UV-precuring was replaced by thermal action. Under heating at 70   °C temperature solvent (butyl acetate) evaporates and layer with proper deformation properties for microrelief embossing was obtained. After microrelief embossing UV-curing of photopolymer follows and photoinitiator initiated radical photopolymerization of TMPETA monomer and UA oligomer proceeds. The goal of this work - to investigate {{the influence of the}} acrylic composition on the UV-cured coating mechanical properties and on the geometrical parameters and optical properties of replicated microrelief. It was defined that coatings with UA oligomer possess higher deformation and mechanical properties due to the increase in layer flexibility. The replicated microrelief of geometrical parameters and diffraction efficiency close to those of master matrix to be used was obtained using compositions containing  30  wt.   %   -   40  wt.   % of  UA.

40|$|Thin UV curable coating {{systems is}} an {{important}} research field from the industrial perspective due to the improved environmental profile and wide varieties of characteristics. When used for short-term applications as coatings on natural nail for esthetical and medical reasons, the system may be manipulated to attain various properties, either desired or required by the manufacturer e. g. ensuring both excellent long-term properties (deformability, toughness, and good adhesion) and short-term properties (ability to be destroyed quickly after use). Performance of thin UV curable <b>urethane</b> <b>acrylate</b> composite coatings was investigated depending {{on the content of}} the additive. Nitrocellulose (NC), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), sucrose benzoate (SB), and silica were evaluated to determine their influence on unreacted composite characteristics (viscosity, suspension pigment stability) and reacted film characteristics (ultimate strength, elongation at break, surface gloss, surface micro hardness, and film adhesion loss). According to the tests performed all additives increase the modulus of elasticity. CAB and NC increase the elongation at break values, and strongly increase the uncured gel viscosity, what makes it inconvenient for application...|$|E
40|$|Recently, UV {{radiation}} coating {{has been}} tremendously utilized in coating as it demonstrated fast curing and solvent free formulation. In this study, UV-LED technology was {{employed as a}} new alternative to conventional UV coating with safer environment and better perfomance. The UV curable coating was prepared based on aliphatic <b>urethane</b> <b>acrylate</b> oligomer, 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate (2 -EHA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), trimethylopropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and hydroxyphenyl ketone photoinitiator (Chivacure 300). The effect of UV-LED irradiation time on curing behaviour was investigated using Attenuated Total Reflectance- Fourier Transform Infra-Red (ATR-FTIR) and gel fraction determination. In addition, the C=C absorption peat at 1635 cm- 1 {{was found to be}} decreased after UV curing. The degree of conversion (DC) was also calculated from the FTIR spectra and {{it was found that the}} DC increased with the increasing of UV irradiation time. Gel fraction of the cured coating was sharply increased after exposed to UV-LED irradiation. However, the gel fraction did not achieve 100 % due to the entrapment of monomer in polymer network. In brief, UV-LED will steer the key interest of this research in order to pursue green aspects in phopolymerization technology...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The surface {{properties}} of high-density polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene were modified by grafting urethane monoacrylate monomer under UV irradiation. This graft polymerization {{was carried out}} on native substrates and on substrates pre-treated by wet oxidation, for different oxidation times. RESULTS: As the urethane monacrylate layer is crosslinked, its grafting efficiency was checked by dissolving the polyethylene substrates in hot toluene. Grafting was evidenced by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of the obtained residues, which showed that both the characteristic <b>urethane</b> <b>acrylate</b> (3350 cm(- 1)) and polyethylene (2920, 730 and 720 cm(- 1)) bands were observable for any polyethylene oxidation time. For an oxidation time longer than 10 hours, acrylate grafting was homogeneous and the grafted surface was smooth with a roughness of less than 10 nm. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the residues revealed that O/C had an average value of 0. 19, which {{is lower than the}} value corresponding to pure acrylate (0. 42), whereas N/C had an average value of 0. 068, also lower than that of pure acrylate (0. 09), thus confirming the grafting. CONCLUSION: A urethane monoacrylate layer was grafted on native and oxidized polyethylene films. For highly oxidized films, the grafted surfaces are smooth and homogeneous.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} steady-state {{crack growth}} at interfaces between polymeric materials and hard substrates under quasi-static conditions. The polymeric material {{is taken to}} be an elastic nonlinear viscous solid while the substrate is treated as a rigid material. Void growth and coalescence in the rate-dependent fracture process zone is modeled by a nonlinear viscous porous strip of cell elements. In {{the first part of}} this paper, the polymeric background material surrounding the process zone is assumed to be purely elastic. Under fixed mode mixity, the computed interface toughness is found to be a monotonically increasing function of crack velocity; toughness also increases rapidly with higher rate sensitivity. This behavior can be explained in terms of voids growing in a strain-rate strengthened process zone. In the second part of the paper, the background material is also treated as an elastic nonlinear viscous solid. The competition between work of separation in the process zone and energy dissipation in the background material leads to a U-shaped toughness–crack velocity curve. Effects of mode mixity, initial porosity, rate sensitivity, as well as the initial yield strain on toughness are studied. The simulations produce trends that agree with interface toughness vs. crack velocity data reported in experimental studies for rubber toughened epoxy-paste adhesive and <b>urethane</b> <b>acrylate</b> adhesive...|$|E
