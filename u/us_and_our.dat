25|$|The moral {{influence}} {{view has}} historically come {{into conflict with}} a penal substitutionary view of atonement, as the two systems propose radically different criteria of salvation and judgment. The moral influence paradigm focuses on the moral change of people, leading to a positive final judgment for which the criteria focuses on inner moral character. By contrast, a penal substitutionary paradigm denies the saving value of human moral change. It focuses on faith in Christ and on his death on our behalf, leading to a positive final judgment based on what Christ has done for <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> trust in that - not on any positive moral qualities that we ourselves possess.|$|E

500|$|The role of {{national}} protectorships within the College {{developed during the}} fifteenth century, due to developments in the emergence {{of national}} monarchies and Renaissance diplomacy.

According to King Henry VIII, the cardinal protector [...] "indueth as it were our owne Person, for the defence of <b>Us</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> Realme in al matiers ...touching the same". The cardinal protector represented the monarch in consistory, especially in cases where the right of investiture was divided between the pope and the monarch, and also led the English diplomatic corps in Rome.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Näslund {{made his}} first and only {{appearance}} in the Winter Olympics at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City. He scored his first and only two Olympic goals during a 7–1 win against Germany. After going undefeated in the round-robin and heralded as medal favourites, Sweden was defeated by Belarus 4–3 in the quarterfinal. The loss was widely {{considered one of the}} most surprising results in Olympic history, while Näslund described the defeat in a post-game interview as [...] "devastating...for <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> country." [...] He finished the tournament with two goals and an assist over four games, ranking fourth on the team in scoring.|$|E

500|$|In 1952, Ursula Franklin married Fred Franklin (born 1921), an {{engineer}} of German Jewish ancestry {{who had been}} exposed to Quakerism while living in England, where he had been sent to boarding school to escape the Nazis in 1936 and remained until emigrating to Canada in 1948. They had no family in Canada and, after their two children were born, they searched for a spiritual home and joined the Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1964. [...] "We were pacifists before we were Quakers," [...] Franklin says, [...] "but it was a very easy transition to Quakerism for us, and it has been a very good home and an extended family for <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> children."

[...] The Seneca [...] "declared they would no more be falsely accused, or fight the Enemy twice" [...] (the latter being an indication that they would refuse quarter in the future). [...] Butler reported that [...] "notwithstanding my utmost Precaution and Endeavours to save the Women and Children, I could not prevent some of them falling unhappy Victims to the Fury of the Savages," [...] but also that {{he spent most of}} his time guarding the fort during the raid. [...] Quebec's Governor Frederick Haldimand was so upset at Butler's inability to control his forces that he refused to see him, writing [...] "such indiscriminate vengeance taken even upon the treacherous and cruel enemy they are engaged against is useless and disreputable to themselves, as it is contrary to the dispositions and maxims of the King whose cause they are fighting." [...] Butler continued to insist in later writings that he was not at fault for the events of the day.|$|E
500|$|In response, Ferdinand {{took control}} of the village {{at the foot of the}} {{mountain}} and encircled the site. He surveyed the locale for two days to identify the most promising angle of attack. The customary equipage of siege warfare—the siege tower, the trebuchet, and the crossbow—would be ineffective. The distance between the curtain wall and the valley floor and the angle of the hill placed the Godesburg out of range. The besiegers had no choice but to use expensive artillery, although the angle would decrease its effectiveness. Ferdinand initially placed three cannons at the foot of the mountain, in Godesberg village. Daily, cannonballs and mortar shells smashed against the castle's walls. Nightly, the defenders repaired the damage. At the following sunrise, the assault began anew. Ferdinand's cannons were ineffective against the fortification, as were his mortars; in the course of the cannonade, return fire even managed to destroy a few of his own pieces. From his place of safety in the north, Gebhard understood well the potential of the loss of the Godesburg, yet he was relatively helpless to help his garrison. In an effort to garner financial support from the Protestant states, in November 1583 he wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, in London: [...] "Verily, the Roman Antichrist moves every stone to oppress <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> churches ..." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his speech}} thanking {{senators}} for electing him, Bujor again voiced his radicalism, asserting that [...] "dawn shows {{itself from the}} East", a discreet allusion to the October Revolution. This generated outrage among opposition members, particularly PNL-ists and Progressive Conservatives who accused him of pro-Bolshevik sympathies. Bujor also had debates with the nationalist senator Ilie Roșoagă, when the latter proposed a vote to recognize Romanian-inhabited portions of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic as irrendenta. Bujor advocated a détente [...] "between <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> neighbors", and insisted that Romanian Ukrainians would not be forgotten for that.
