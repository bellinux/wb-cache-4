40|$|Clustering is an {{essential}} data mining task with numerous applications. However, data in most real-life applications are high-dimensional in nature, and the related information often spreads across multiple relations. To ensure effective and efficient high-dimensional, cross-relational clustering, we propose a new approach, called CrossClus, which performs cross-relational clustering with <b>user’s</b> <b>guidance.</b> We believe that <b>user’s</b> <b>guidance,</b> even likely in very simple forms, could be essential for effective high-dimensional clustering since a user knows well the application requirements and data semantics. CrossClus is carried out as follows: a user specifies a clustering task and selects one or a small set of features pertinent to the task. CrossClus extracts the set of highly relevant features in multiple relations connected via linkages defined in the database schema, evaluates their effectiveness based on <b>user’s</b> <b>guidance,</b> and identifies interesting clusters that fit user’s needs. This method takes care of both quality in feature extraction and efficiency in clustering. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of this approach. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis article aims at {{providing}} a new Parameter Mapping Sonification approach {{in order to}} facilitate and generalize sonification design for different applications. First a definition of the target as a con-cept that enables a general sonification strategy that is not limited to specific data types is given. This concept intends to facilitate the sepa-ration between sound and information to display. Rather than directly displaying data dimensions through the variation of a specific sound pa-rameter, the approach aims at displaying the distance between a given data value and the requested value. Then a taxonomy of sound strategies based on sound that allow the construction of several strategy types is presented. Finally, several sound strategies are evaluated with a user ex-periment and the taxonomy is discussed on the basis of <b>user's</b> <b>guidance</b> behavior during a guiding task...|$|R

40|$|The {{clash between}} the borderless Internet and the {{geographically}} structured legal landscape is almost universally adopted {{as the starting}} point for discussions of Internet jurisdiction issues. This clash is important, but to fully appreciate its implications we need to proceed far into the territory of jurisprudence. Here, I draw attention to how three presumptions that underpin all legal systems are stretched beyond their legitimate boundaries where domestic law is applied to the Internet in an extraterritorial manner. The consequences of this are severe and must influence such application of the law. I propose that the goal we should aim at is what can be described as jurisdictional interoperability between the various domestic legal systems that regulate our conduct online. I also show that, in its reliance on ‘morality’, natural law theory provides Internet <b>users</b> <b>guidance</b> as to which legal rules, within their respective contextual legal systems, they need to abide by...|$|R
40|$|Mixed-initiative {{clustering}} is {{a machine}} learning task that integrates a machine’s clustering capability and a <b>user’s</b> <b>guidance</b> {{in order to}} obtain the user’s desired result. This task is different from traditional autonomous clustering tasks by introducing user criterion, a user’s understanding of data and purpose of sorting. We propose a framework for mixed-initiative clustering to solve problems such as how to model a user’s criterion and how to utilize the criterion to improve the clustering performance. Our approach consists of representing properties of the clustering model to a user and letting the user gives feedback on these properties. We also demonstrate the feasibility of this framework using an application called ”activity extraction from personal workstation contents. ” Our work includes building structured activity descriptions to represent a machine’s speculation and a new clustering algorithm, the SpeClustering model, that enables extended user feedback. Furthermore, we identified the SpeClustering model as an instantiation of mixed-initiative clustering. 1...|$|R
40|$|We address two {{key issues}} of co-segmentation over mul-tiple images. The first {{is whether a}} pure {{unsupervised}} al-gorithm can satisfactorily solve this problem. Without the <b>user’s</b> <b>guidance,</b> segmenting the foregrounds implied by the common object is quite a challenging task, especially when substantial variations in the object’s appearance, shape, and scale are allowed. The second issue concerns the effi-ciency if the technique can lead to practical uses. With these in mind, we establish an MRF optimization model that has an energy function with nice properties and can be shown to effectively resolve the two difficulties. Specifically, instead of relying on the user inputs, our approach introduces a co-saliency prior as the hint about possible foreground loca-tions, and uses it to construct the MRF data terms. To com-plete the optimization framework, we include a novel global term that is more appropriate to co-segmentation, and re-sults in a submodular energy function. The proposed model can thus be optimally solved by graph cuts. We demonstrate these advantages by testing our method on several bench-mark datasets. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Pervasive Computing environments are {{dynamic and}} heterogeneous. They are {{required}} to be self-managing and autonomic, demanding minimal <b>user’s</b> <b>guidance.</b> In pervasive computing, contextaware adaptation is a key concept to meet the varying requirements of different clients. In order to enable context-aware adaptation, context information must be gathered and eventually presented to the application performing the adaptation. It is clear {{that some form of}} context categorization will be required given the wide range of heterogeneous context information. Categorizations can be made from different viewpoints such as conceptual viewpoint, measurement viewpoint, temporal characteristics viewpoint and so on. To facilitate the programming of context-aware applications, modelling of contextual information is highly necessary. Most of the existing models fail both to represent dependency relations between the diverse context information, and to utilize these dependency relations. A number of them support narrow classes of context and applied to limited types of application, and most do not consider the issue of Quality of Contextual Information (QoCI). Along with a detailed context categorization, this paper will analyse existing context models and discuss their handling of dependency issues. It uses this analysis to derive a methodology for quality context information modelling in context aware computing. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{architecture}} of distributed data storage framework that incorporates fault tolerance, mobility support, and security. Main goal {{of our system}} is to provide equal opportunities for both connected and disconnected clients. Consequence is that mutual exclusion may not be involved. Data storage systems without mutual exclusion suffer from update and name conflicts. We avoid the update conflicts using immutable data storage. Mutable data is provided via either file versioning or Redo Logs. The name conflicts are automatically resolved without <b>user’s</b> <b>guidance,</b> the file names are automatically changed to non-conflicting names, the directories are represented implicitly and thus we avoid conflict names connected to directories. Because the file names may be changed by the system, each file version is assigned an immutable globally unique identifier using which the file version can be accessed. Security model is based on certificates and VOMS attributes. This system is suitable for use within Grid VOs and it also supports services provided simultaneously to different VOs.
