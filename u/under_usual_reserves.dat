40|$|Following {{treatment}} with Trichoderma reesei cellulases, the mechanical properties of cotton fabrics were measured {{to assess the}} effect of adsorbed enzymes. The ability of adsorbed cellulases to act as anchors for further wet finishing processes was studied. Dried fabric samples, after 105 days <b>under</b> <b>usual</b> storage conditions, showed neither significant strength loss, nor any changes {{in the degree of}} polymerisation. After five months of storage, the enzymes were still found to be active. The adsorption of T reesei cellulases produced an increase in staining levels after dyeing with an acid dye, but washing fastness was poor. Washing with soap under alkaline conditions removed proteins almost completely. Adsorption of T reesei cellulases is reversible and desorption increases from pH 5 to pH 10. Because of the protein desorption <b>under</b> <b>usual</b> alkaline washing conditions, no practical application of adsorbed cellulases for further finishing processes is suggested and more work is required...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective To {{study the}} effects of reduced {{lighting}} on the gait of older adults with a high level gait disorder (HLGD) and to compare their response to that of healthy elderly controls. Methods 22 patients with a HLGD and 20 age-matched healthy controls were studied <b>under</b> <b>usual</b> lighting conditions (1000 lumens) and in near darkness (5 lumens). Gait speed and gait dynamics were measured under both conditions. Cognitive function, co-morbidities, depressive symptoms, and vision were also evaluated. Results <b>Under</b> <b>usual</b> lighting conditions, patients walked more slowly, with reduced swing times, and increased stride-to-stride variability, compared to controls. When walking under near darkness conditions, both groups slowed their gait. All other measures of gait were not affected by lighting in the controls. In contrast, patients further reduced their swing times and increased their stride-to-stride variability, both stride time variability and swing time variability. The unique response of the patients was not explained by vision, mental status, co-morbidities, or the values of walking <b>under</b> <b>usual</b> lighting conditions. Conclusion Walking with reduced lighting does not affect the gait of healthy elderly subjects, except for a reduction in speed. On the other hand, the gait of older adults with a HLGD becomes more variable and unsteady when they walk in near darkness, despite adapting a slow and cautious gait. Further work is needed to identify the causes of the maladaptive response among patients with a HLGD and the potential connection between this behavior and the increased fall risk observed in these patients. </p...|$|R
