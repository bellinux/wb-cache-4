25|$|Traditional work {{in biology}} {{has focused on}} {{studying}} individual parts of cell signaling pathways. Systems biology research helps <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the underlying structure of cell signaling networks and how changes in these networks may affect the transmission and flow of information (signal transduction). Such networks are complex systems in their organization and may exhibit a number of emergent properties including bistability and ultrasensitivity. Analysis of cell signaling networks requires a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches including the development and analysis of simulations and modeling. Long-range allostery is often a significant component of cell signaling events.|$|E

25|$|Murphy concludes that,"Just as the Son of God limited {{himself by}} taking human form and dying on a cross, God limits divine {{action in the}} world to be in accord with {{rational}} laws which God has chosen. This enables <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the world on its own terms, but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation."For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a methodological naturalism, meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a metaphysical naturalism, which proposes that nature is all that there is.|$|E
25|$|Religious persons acquire {{religious}} {{ideas and}} practices through social exposure. The {{child of a}} Zen Buddhist will not become an evangelical Christian or a Zulu warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a Roman Catholic but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required – this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of thin air. Boyer says cognitive science can help <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the psychological mechanisms that account for these manifest correlations {{and in so doing}} enable us to better understand the nature of religious belief and practice.|$|E
25|$|The ELEMENT study {{dealt with}} {{determinants}} {{of academic achievement}} in Berlin. It {{was carried out in}} Berlin, where some of the pupils started at a Gymnasium after the 4th grade, while others stayed in primary school until 6th grade and started at different schools after the 6th grade. Factors correlated with academic achievement tend to be intercorrelated (that means that they are also correlated with other factors that determine academic achievement). The number of books owned by a pupil's parents, for example, is correlated with the parents' education. Because of this Multiple Regression Analysis was used. Multiple Regression allows <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the influence of one variable when the other variables are held fixed.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems to}} be one of the {{fundamental}} features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> a bit of the universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can hope to understand the universe better.|$|E
25|$|In Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World (1978), Girard {{develops}} {{the implications of}} this discovery. The victimary process is the missing link between the animal world and the human world, the principle that explains the humanization of primates. It allows <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the need for sacrificial victims, which in turn explains the hunt which is primitively ritual, and the domestication of animals as a fortuitous result of the acclimatization of a reserve of victims, or agriculture. It shows that at the beginning of all culture is archaic religion, which Durkheim had sensed. The elaboration of the rites and taboos by proto-human or human groups would take infinitely varied forms while obeying a rigorous practical sense that we can detect: the prevention of the return of the mimetic crisis. So we can find in archaic religion the origin of all political or cultural institutions.|$|E
25|$|Lake {{and marine}} environments on Earth are {{favorable}} for fossil preservation, especially where the sediments {{they left behind}} are rich in carbonates or clays. Hundreds of highland craters on Mars have horizontally layered, sedimentary rocks that may have formed in lakes. CRISM has taken many targeted observations of these rocks to measure their mineralogy and how the minerals vary between layers. Variation between layers helps <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{the sequence of events}} that formed the sedimentary rocks. The Mars Orbiter Camera found that where valley networks empty into craters, commonly the craters contain fan-shaped deposits. However it was not completely clear if the fans formed by sediment deposition on dry crater floors (alluvial fans) or in crater lakes (deltas). CRISM discovered that in the fans' lowermost layers, there are concentrated deposits of clay. More clay occurs beyond the end of the fans on the crater floors, and in some cases there is also opal. On Earth, the lowermost layers of deltas are called bottom set beds, and they are made of clays that settled out of inflowing river water in quiet, deep parts of the lakes. This discovery supports the idea that many fans formed in crater lakes where, potentially, evidence for habitable environments could be preserved.|$|E

The chapter develops a three-part theory of constitutional dynamics by analyzing the the complex interaction of the federal system’s varied building blocks: the national government, the state governments, and the auxiliary institutions of governance (such as a judiciary), and the non-governmental institutions, including the party system. First, constitutional innovation derives from constitutional ambiguity and institutional imperfection. Second, complementary institutions constrain informal constitutional change to an incremental path, preventing radical ruptures from past practice. Third, through a model of behavioral spillovers and cross-domain influences, the chapter offers a theory {{of the emergence of}} constitutional trends. These dynamics may help <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how periods of centralizatio...|$|R

500|$|Upon publication, [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] and {{the other}} poems in Poe's {{collection}} drew harsh criticism because of {{how difficult it was}} to understand.

In trying to explain the title poem, he wrote, [...] "all our brain-cudgeling could not compel <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it line by line or the sum total". A reviewer for the Baltimore Minerva and Emerald asked, [...] "Has the poet been struck dumb with palsy?" [...] Before publication, Poe had sought the advice of William Wirt, who had earned a reputation as a distinguished man of letters in Baltimore. On [...] "Al Aaraaf", Wirt wrote that he was not the best judge of poetry but believed that it might be accepted by modern-thinking readers. As he wrote, [...] "but to deal candidly... (as I am bound to do) I should doubt whether the poem will take with old-fashioned readers like myself". Sarah Josepha Hale of Godey's Lady's Book noted that [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] must have been written by a young author because it was [...] "boyish, feeble, and altogether deficient in the common characteristics of poetry". Nevertheless, she still called the author a genius. A reviewer for the American Ladies' Magazine also commented on the poet's age: [...] " [...] author who appears to be very young, is evidently a fine genius, but he wants judgment, experience, tact".|$|E
