5|$|Fibonacci {{search is}} a method similar to binary search that {{successively}} shortens the interval in which the maximum of a <b>unimodal</b> function lies. Given a finite interval, a <b>unimodal</b> function, and the maximum length of the resulting interval, Fibonacci search finds a Fibonacci number such that if the interval is divided equally into that many subintervals, the subintervals would be shorter than the maximum length. After dividing the interval, it eliminates the subintervals in which the maximum cannot lie until one or more contiguous subintervals remain.|$|E

25|$|In {{simulations}} with a variates {{drawn from}} a uniform distribution the PCI2 has a symmetric <b>unimodal</b> distribution. The tails of its distribution are larger than those of a normal distribution.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} interaction {{between these two}} systems (corticotectal interactions) is {{the connection between the}} anterior ectosylvian sulcus (AES), which lies at the junction of the parietal, temporal and frontal lobes, and the SC. The AES is divided into three <b>unimodal</b> regions with multisensory neurons at the junctions between these sections. (Jiang & Stein, 2003). Neurons from the <b>unimodal</b> regions project to the deep layers of the SC and influence the multiplicative integration effect. That is, although they can receive inputs from all modalities as normal, the SC can not enhance or depress the effect of multisensory stimulation without input from the AES.|$|E
25|$|When the {{probability}} density {{function of a}} continuous distribution has multiple local maxima {{it is common to}} refer to all of the local maxima as modes of the distribution. Such a continuous distribution is called multimodal (as opposed to <b>unimodal).</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{symmetric}} <b>unimodal</b> distributions, such as {{the normal}} distribution, the mean (if defined), median and mode all coincide. For samples, if {{it is known that}} they are drawn from a symmetric distribution, the sample mean can be used as an estimate of the population mode.|$|E
25|$|Gastwirth {{estimated}} the asymptotic variance of n−1/2D. If the distribution is <b>unimodal</b> and symmetric about 0, the asymptotic variance lies between 1/4 and 1. Assuming {{a conservative estimate}} (putting the variance equal to 1) {{can lead to a}} true level of significance well below the nominal level.|$|E
25|$|For many distributions, the {{standard}} deviation is not a particularly natural way of quantifying the structure. For example, uncertainty relations in {{which one of the}} observables is an angle has little physical meaning for fluctuations larger than one period. Other examples include highly bimodal distributions, or <b>unimodal</b> distributions with divergent variance.|$|E
25|$|Multisensory neurons {{exist in}} {{a large number of}} locations, often {{integrated}} with <b>unimodal</b> neurons. They have recently been discovered in areas previously thought to be modality specific, such as the somatosensory cortex; as well as in clusters at the borders between the major cerebral lobes, such as the occipito-parietal space and the occipito-temporal space.|$|E
25|$|In {{continuous}} <b>unimodal</b> distributions {{the median}} often lies between {{the mean and}} the mode, about {{one third of the}} way going from mean to mode. In a formula, median ≈ (2 × mean + mode)/3. This rule, due to Karl Pearson, often applies to slightly non-symmetric distributions that resemble a normal distribution, but it is not always true and in general the three statistics can appear in any order.|$|E
25|$|Global {{downhill}} folding (or one-state folding) {{is another}} {{scenario in which}} the protein folds {{in the absence of}} a free energy barrier under all conditions. In other words, there is a <b>unimodal</b> population distribution at all temperatures and denaturant concentrations, suggesting a continuous unfolding transition in which different ensembles of structures populate at different conditions. This is in contrast to two-state folding, which assumes only two ensembles (folded and unfolded) and a sharp unfolding transition.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{are able}} to extract {{meaningful}} distinctions in the language {{they are exposed to}} from statistical properties of that language. For example, if English-learning infants are exposed to a prevoiced /d/ to voiceless unaspirated /t/ continuum (similar to the /d/ - /t/ distinction in Spanish) with the majority of the tokens occurring near the endpoints of the continuum, i.e., showing extreme prevoicing versus long voice onset times (bimodal distribution) they are better at discriminating these sounds than infants who are exposed primarily to tokens {{from the center of the}} continuum (<b>unimodal</b> distribution).|$|E
25|$|Distributional {{learning}} {{has also been}} found to help infants contrast two phonemes that they initially have difficulty in discriminating between. Maye, Weiss, and Aslin found that infants {{who were exposed to}} a bimodal distribution of a non-native contrast that was initially difficult to discriminate were better able to discriminate the contrast than infants exposed to a <b>unimodal</b> distribution of the same contrast. Maye et al. also found that infants were able to abstract features of a contrast (i.e., voicing onset time) and generalize that feature to the same type of contrast at a different place of articulation, a finding that has not been found in adults.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} riders who will share a vehicle {{is a key}} unknown. In the U.S., the average car carries 1.16 persons, and most industrialized {{countries}} commonly average below two people; not having to share a vehicle with strangers is a key advantage of private transport. Based on these figures, {{some have suggested that}} two passengers per vehicle (such as with <b>UniModal),</b> or even a single passenger per vehicle is optimum. Other designs use a car for a model, and choose larger vehicles, making it possible to accommodate families with small children, riders with bicycles, disabled passengers with wheelchairs, or a pallet or two of freight.|$|E
25|$|Acknowledging these variations, many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} established to reflect why these observations are task-dependent. Given that different senses develop at different rates, it has been proposed that cross-modal integration does not appear until both modalities have reached maturity. The human body undergoes significant physical transformation throughout childhood. Not only is there growth in size and stature (affecting viewing height), {{but there is also}} change in inter-ocular distance and eyeball length. Therefore, sensory signals need to be constantly re-evaluated to appreciate these various physiological changes. Some support comes from animal studies that explore the neurobiology behind integration. Adult monkeys have deep inter-neuronal connections within the superior colliculus providing strong, accelerated visuo-auditory integration. Young animals conversely, do not have this enhancement until <b>unimodal</b> properties are fully developed.|$|E
25|$|Multimodal imaging {{frequently}} {{consists of}} the coupling of an electrophysiologic measurement technique, such as EEG or MEG, with a hemodynamic one such as fMRI or PET. While the intention {{is to use the}} strengths and limitations of each to complement the other, current approaches suffer from experimental limitations. Some previous work has focused on attempting to use the high spatial resolution of fMRI to determine the (spatial) origin of EEG/MEG signals, so that in future work this spatial information could be extracted from a <b>unimodal</b> EEG/MEG signal. While some studies have seen success in correlating signal origins between modalities to within a few millimeters, the results have not been uniformly positive. Another current limitation is the actual experimental setup: taking measurements using both modalities at once yields inferior signals, but the alternative of measuring each modality separately is confounded by trial-to-trial variability.|$|E
25|$|Concurrently, the multisensory neurons of the AES, {{although}} also integrally {{connected to}} <b>unimodal</b> AES neurons, {{are not directly}} connected to the SC. This pattern of division is reflected {{in other areas of}} the cortex, resulting in the observation that cortical and tectal multisensory systems are somewhat dissociated. Stein, London, Wilkinson and Price (1996) analysed the perceived luminance of an LED in the context of spatially disparate auditory distracters of various types. A significant finding was that a sound increased the perceived brightness of the light, regardless of their relative spatial locations, provided the light's image was projected onto the fovea. Here, the apparent lack of the spatial rule, further differentiates cortical and tectal multisensory neurons. Little empirical evidence exists to justify this dichotomy. Nevertheless, cortical neurons governing perception, and a separate sub cortical system governing action (orientation behavior) is synonymous with the perception action hypothesis of the visual stream. Further investigation into this field is necessary before any substantial claims can be made.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} {{based on}} an extension of Zwanzig's model of protein folding indicates that global downhill folding proteins should reveal different apparent melting temperatures (Tms) when monitored by different techniques. This was experimentally confirmed in the protein BBL mentioned above. The unfolding followed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence all revealed different apparent melting temperatures. A wavelength-dependent melting temperature was also observed in the CD experiments. The data analyzed with a structure-based statistical mechanical model resulted in a <b>unimodal</b> population distribution at all temperatures, indicating a structurally uncoupled continuous unfolding process. The crucial issue in such experiments is to use probes that monitor {{different aspects of the}} structure. For example, DSC gives information on the heat capacity changes (and hence enthalpy) associated with unfolding, fluorescence on the immediate environment of the fluorophore, FRET on the average dimensions of the molecule and CD on the secondary structure.|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{discovery}} of infants’ statistical learning abilities in word learning, the same general mechanism has also been studied in other facets of language learning. For example, it is well-established that infants can discriminate between phonemes of many different languages but eventually become unable to discriminate between phonemes that do not appear in their native language; however, {{it was not clear}} how this decrease in discriminatory ability came about. Maye et al. suggested that the mechanism responsible might be a statistical learning mechanism in which infants track the distributional regularities of the sounds in their native language. To test this idea, Maye et al. exposed 6- and 8-month-old infants to a continuum of speech sounds that varied on {{the degree to which they}} were voiced. The distribution that the infants heard was either bimodal, with sounds from both ends of the voicing continuum heard most often, or <b>unimodal,</b> with sounds from the middle of the distribution heard most often. The results indicated that infants from both age groups were sensitive to the distribution of phonemes. At test, infants heard either non-alternating (repeated exemplars of tokens 3 or 6 from an 8-token continuum) or alternating (exemplars of tokens 1 and 8) exposures to specific phonemes on the continuum. Infants exposed to the bimodal distribution listened longer to the alternating trials than the non-alternating trials while there was no difference in listening times for infants exposed to the <b>unimodal</b> distribution. This finding indicates that infants exposed the bimodal distribution were better able to discriminate sounds from the two ends of the distribution than were infants in the <b>unimodal</b> condition, regardless of age. This type of statistical learning differs from that used in lexical acquisition, as it requires infants to track frequencies rather than transitional probabilities, and has been named “distributional learning.” ...|$|E
