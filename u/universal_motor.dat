25|$|A commutated {{electrically}} excited series or parallel wound motor {{is referred}} to as a <b>universal</b> <b>motor</b> because it can be designed to operate on AC or DC power. A <b>universal</b> <b>motor</b> can operate well on AC because the current in both the field and the armature coils (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) in synchronism, and hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a constant direction of rotation.|$|E
25|$|Benchtop table saws, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} job-site saws, are lightweight and {{are designed to}} be placed on a table or other support for operation. They commonly have direct drive (no v-belt or pulleys) from a <b>universal</b> <b>motor.</b> They can be lifted by one person and carried to the job location. These saws often have parts made of steel, aluminum and plastic and {{are designed to be}} compact and light.|$|E
25|$|The American Flea Ship is a homebuilt triplane {{variant of}} the French-designed Mignet Flea {{licensed}} by American Mignet Aircraft, and later Universal Aircraft company of Ft Worth, Texas. It {{is also known as}} the Flea Triplane. The aircraft was given away by Universal as a marketing effort when a <b>Universal</b> <b>motor</b> was purchased to power it. Later, the fuselage sold for $695. The kit version of the aircraft was designed by Lillian Holden. Ace Aircraft Manufacturing Company maintains the rights to the American Flea Ship and Heath Parasol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Universal</b> <b>motors</b> are series wound. Shunt winding {{was used}} experimentally, {{in the late}} 19th century, but was {{impractical}} owing to problems with commutation. Various schemes of embedded resistance, inductance and antiphase cross-coupling were attempted to reduce this. <b>Universal</b> <b>motors,</b> including shunt wound, were favoured as AC motors at this time as they were self-starting. When self-starting induction motors and automatic starters became available, these replaced the larger <b>universal</b> <b>motors</b> (above 1 hp) and the shunt wound.|$|R
50|$|Series <b>motors</b> called <b>universal</b> <b>motors</b> {{can be used}} on {{alternating}} current. Since {{the armature}} voltage and the field direction reverse at the same time, torque continues to be produced in the same direction. However they run at a lower speed with lower torque on AC supply when compared to DC due to reactance voltage drop in AC which is not present in DC."Universal motor", Construction and working characteristics, Retrieved on 27 April 2015.Since the speed is not related to the line frequency, <b>universal</b> <b>motors</b> can develop higher-than-synchronous speeds, making them lighter than induction motors of the same rated mechanical output. This is a valuable characteristic for hand-held power tools. <b>Universal</b> <b>motors</b> for commercial utility are usually of small capacity, not more than about 1 kW output. However, much larger <b>universal</b> <b>motors</b> were used for electric locomotives, fed by special low-frequency traction power networks to avoid problems with commutation under heavy and varying loads.|$|R
50|$|As {{the speed}} increases, the {{inductance}} of the rotor {{means that the}} ideal commutating point changes. Small motors typically have fixed commutation. While some larger <b>universal</b> <b>motors</b> have rotatable commutation, this is rare. Instead larger <b>universal</b> <b>motors</b> often have compensation windings in series with the motor, or sometimes inductively coupled, and placed at ninety electrical degrees to the main field axis. These reduce the reactance of the armature, and improve the commutation.|$|R
25|$|An {{advantage}} of the <b>universal</b> <b>motor</b> is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and power tools, that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor {{can be used to}} agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.|$|E
25|$|Benchtop {{table saws}} {{are the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The <b>universal</b> <b>motor</b> is not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop table saw is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which makes it harder to make a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from the front edge of the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by the table in front of the blade). Benchtop saws are the smallest type of table saw and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E

2500|$|... 1953 saw the {{introductions}} of raised spectator protection banks. This {{was to be}} Parker's year for he won the Autosport Formula 3 Championship taking seven races at Brands on his way the title. Some 50,000 people packed into the Daily Telegraph International and as the season {{came to an end}} Parker raised the lap record to 74.38mph (48.4secs). During 1953, the <b>Universal</b> <b>Motor</b> Racing Club was established, with a racing school set up at Brands Hatch. The Half Litre Club, later to become the British Racing and Sports Car Club (BRSCC), ran many races throughout the 1950s and firmly established the venue as one of Britain's top racing circuits.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{armature}} windings of a direct-current or <b>universal</b> <b>motor</b> are moving through a magnetic field, {{they have a}} voltage induced in them. This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called [...] "back electromotive force (emf)". The voltage {{is proportional to the}} running speed of the motor. The back emf of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back emf results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load.|$|E

He made his debut in a Cooper 500 Formula 3 car and was committed to racing thereafter. Hill joined Team Lotus as a mechanic soon after but quickly talked {{his way into the}} cockpit. The Lotus presence in Formula One allowed him to make his debut at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix, retiring with a halfshaft failure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Universal</b> <b>motors</b> {{have high}} {{starting}} torque, can run at high speed, and are lightweight and compact. They {{are commonly used}} in portable power tools and equipment, {{as well as many}} household appliances. They're also relatively easy to control, electromechanically using tapped coils, or electronically. However, the commutator has brushes that wear, so they are much less often used for equipment that is in continuous use. In addition, partly because of the commutator, <b>universal</b> <b>motors</b> are typically very noisy, both acoustically and electromagnetically.|$|R
