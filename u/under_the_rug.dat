It is a choice which I think no State can constitutionally demand. For me {{this is not something}} that can be swept <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> and forgotten in the interest of enforced Sunday togetherness. I think the impact of this law upon these appellants grossly violates their constitutional right to the free exercise of their religion.|$|E

Former Wyoming Governor Dave Freudenthal, who played the prosecuting attorney in the Cheyenne event, said: [...] "This particular part of Wyoming history had been swept <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug.</b> So I'm really delighted to participate in drawing attention to it." [...] The event was organized to coincide with the publication of a new study of Hunt's death, Dying for Joe McCarthy's Sins by Rodger McDaniel, a Presbyterian pastor, former Wyoming legislator (1971–1981), and Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1982. He used some of Larson's research.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final phase}} of Reis' scheme was to buy {{controlling}} interest in the Bank of Portugal, a step which {{would allow him to}} retroactively make his fiction about Bank approval true. [...] With control of the bank, the entire counterfeiting could be swept <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug,</b> ensuring that there would never be any evidence of the fraud. During the summer and fall of 1925, while he and Hennies toured Angola, he had Bandeira and his own assistant Francisco Ferreira, Jr. [...] ferreting out the ownership of the Bank shares (it was secret) and buying them under the complicated rules that the Bank's charter allowed. [...] Eventually they controlled 10,000 of the 45,000 shares needed for controlling interest in the bank, but publicity led Bandeira to ease off the purchases even as he sent Reis ever more inflated false reports of the number of shares they had acquired.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{one of the}} {{trustees}} told The Morning Call of Allentown that the board {{had no choice but}} to force Paterno to leave immediately to contain the growing outrage over the scandal. According to the trustee, the board considered letting Paterno finish the season with Bradley as team spokesman, but ultimately decided that would still keep the focus on Paterno. The board also did not like that Paterno released statements on his own rather than through the school, with some board members feeling he may have breached his contract. The trustee also noted that he and many of his colleagues felt Paterno either [...] "knew about [...] and swept it <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug,</b> or he didn't ask enough questions." [...] The board was also very angered by Spanier's statements of support for Curley and Schultz. A few months later, the board of trustees chairman Steve Garban and vice chairman John Surma issued a statement saying that the board felt Paterno [...] "could not be expected to continue to effectively perform his duties" [...] in the wake of the scandal.|$|E

2500|$|Callum Marsh of Slant Magazine {{gave the}} film 1 star, and wrote: [...] "Flaws—and {{there are a}} great many that would have never made the cut were this a perfectible studio recording—are {{conveniently}} swept <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> of candid expression ... the worst quality of Les Misérables's live singing is simply that it puts too much pressure on a handful of performers who frankly cannot sing.... Fisheye lenses and poorly framed close-ups abound in Les Misérables, nearly every frame a revelation of one man's bad taste ... One would be hard-pressed to describe this, despite the wealth of beauty on display, as anything but an ugly film, shot and cut ineptly. Everything in the film, songs included, is cranked to 11, the melodrama of it all soaring. So it's odd that this kind of showboating maximalism should be ultimately reduced to a few fisheye'd faces, mugging for their close-up, as the people sing off-key and broken." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Michael Philips gave the film only one and a half stars, writing: [...] "The camera bobs and weaves like a drunk, frantically. So you have hammering close-ups, combined with woozy insecurity each time more than two people are in the frame. ...too little in this frenzied mess of a film registers because Hooper is trying to make everything register at the same nutty pitch." ...|$|E

60|$|The man obeyed at {{once with}} the unquestioning {{readiness}} of one used to his mistress' whims. For several minutes she remained silent. She had {{the air of}} one drinking in with almost passionate eagerness the sedative effect of the stillness, the soft spring air, the musical country sounds, the ripple of the breeze in the trees, the humming of insects, the soft splash of the lake against the stony shore. Philip himself was awakened into a peculiar sense of pleasure by this, almost his {{first glimpse of the}} country since his arrival in New York. A host of half forgotten sensations warmed his heart. He felt suddenly intensely sympathetic, perhaps more genuinely tender than he had ever felt before towards the woman by his side, whose hour of suffering it was. His hand slipped <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> and held her fingers, which clutched his in instantaneous response. Her lips seemed unlocked by his slight action.|$|E
6000|$|All the {{way home}} in the {{carriage}} he felt at least as happy over her good fortune as over his own, which had been substantial. He took her hand <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> and squeezed it, and she answered with a long, gentle pressure, quite unlike the clutch when they were driving in. That same evening he strolled out to where the river curved below the Abbey. The sun had not quite set, and its last smoky radiance slanted into the burnished autumn woods. Some white-faced Herefords were grazing in lush grass, the river rippled and gleamed, all over golden scales. About that scene was the magic which has so often startled the hearts of painters, the wistful gold--the enchantment of a dream. For some minutes he had gazed with delight which had in it a sort of despair. A little crisp rustle ran along the bushes; the leaves fluttered, then hung quite still. And he heard a voice--Alicia's--speaking. [...] "My lovely, lovely world!" [...] And moving forward a step, he saw her standing on the river-bank, braced against {{the trunk of a}} birch-tree, her head thrown back, and her arms stretched wide apart as though to clasp the lovely world she had apostrophised. To have gone up to her would have been like breaking up a lovers' interview, and he turned round instead and went away.|$|E
5000|$|The {{driver for}} {{seafloor}} spreading in plates with active margins is {{the weight of}} the cool, dense, subducting slabs that pull them along.

6000|$|The pink berries glowed on {{the grey}} stone, {{and he had}} yet another memory. A family {{occasion}} when Uncle Martin Scudamore departed this life, and they all went up to bury him and hear his Will. The old chap, whom they had looked on {{as a bit of}} a disgrace, money-grubbing up in the little grey Yorkshire town which owed its rise to his factory, was expected to make amends by his death, for he had never married--too sunk in Industry, apparently, to have the time. By tacit agreement, his nephews and nieces had selected the Inn at Bolton Abbey, nearest beauty spot, for their stay. They had driven six miles to the funeral in three carriages. Alicia had gone with him and his brother, the solicitor. In her plain black clothes she looked quite charming, in spite of the silver threads already thick in her fine dark hair, loosened by the moor wind. She had talked of painting to him with all her old enthusiasm, and her eyes had seemed to linger on his face as if she still had a little weakness for him. He had quite enjoyed that drive. They had come rather abruptly on the small grimy town clinging to the river-banks, with old Martin's long yellow-brick house dominating it, about two hundred yards above the mills. Suddenly <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> he felt Alicia's hand seize his with a sort of desperation, for all the world as if she were clinging to something to support her. Indeed, he was sure she did not know it was his hand she squeezed. The cobbled streets, the muddy-looking water, the dingy, staring factories, the yellow staring house, the little dark-clothed, dreadfully plain work-people, all turned out to do a last honour to their creator; the hideous new grey church, the dismal service, the brand-new tombstones--and all of a glorious autumn day! It was inexpressibly sordid--too ugly for words! Afterwards the Will was read to them, seated decorously on bright mahogany chairs in the yellow mansion; a very satisfactory Will, distributing in perfectly adjusted portions, to his own kinsfolk and nobody else, a very considerable wealth. Scudamore had listened to it dreamily, with his eyes fixed on an oily picture, thinking: [...] "My God! What a thing!" [...] and longing {{to be back in the}} carriage smoking a cigar to take the reek of black clothes, and sherry--sherry!--out of his nostrils. He happened to look at Alicia. Her eyes were closed; her lips, always sweet-looking, quivered amusedly. And at that very moment the Will came to her name. He saw those eyes open wide, and marked a beautiful pink flush, quite like that of old days, come into her thin cheeks. [...] "Splendid!" [...] he had thought; [...] "it's really jolly for her. I am glad. Now she won't have to pinch. Splendid!" [...] He shared with her to the full the surprised relief showing in her still beautiful face.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Staples <b>rug</b> is a remarkable, oversized, two-faced Navajo weaving, {{from the}} Transi-tion Period, that survives {{today in the}} Navajo textile {{collection}} at the Museum of North-ern Arizona (MNA) in Flagstaff, Arizona. <b>The</b> <b>rug</b> was woven between 1885 and 1890 {{at the behest of}} pioneering trader Juan Lorenzo Hubbell at Hubbell’s Trading Post in Ganado, Arizona. C. N. Cotton, himself a noted trader and former Hubbell partner, ac-quired <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> and used it on the floor of his dining room in Gallup, New Mexico. Later, Cotton sent <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> to his friend and fellow trader Berton Staples to have a hole repaired. For unknown reasons, Staples retained <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> at his trading post in Coolidge, New Mexico, on the floor of his living room, until his death in 1938. Staples friend, archaeologist Winifred Gladwin, acquired <b>the</b> <b>rug</b> after Staples death for partial settle-ment of incurred debts. <b>The</b> <b>rug</b> was used on the floor of Gladwin’s Gila Pueblo head-quarters in Globe, Arizona. After dissolution of the Gila Pueblo in 1950, Mrs. Gladwin gifted <b>the</b> Staples <b>rug</b> to <b>the</b> Arizona State Museum (ASM) at the University of Arizona in Tucson. In 1958, following the donation of her valuable textile collection to the MNA, Mrs. Gladwin requested that <b>the</b> Staples <b>rug</b> be transferred to Flagstaff to join the rest of her collection.
