5|$|HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is a {{proprietary}} audio/video interface for transmitting <b>uncompressed</b> video data and compressed or <b>uncompressed</b> digital audio data from an HDMI-compliant source device, {{such as a}} display controller, to a compatible computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital audio device. HDMI is a digital replacement for analog video standards.|$|E
5|$|<b>Uncompressed</b> 10bpc {{color depth}} and RGB or YCBCR 4:4:4 color format are assumed on this table except where noted.|$|E
5|$|As {{of release}} 114 (December 2012), the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database {{contains}} approximately 5×1011 nucleotides with an <b>uncompressed</b> filesize of 1.6 terabytes.|$|E

50|$|For files {{produced}} by compress on other systems, <b>uncompress</b> supports 9- to 16-bit compression.|$|R
50|$|It also {{provides}} a filter for decompressing (inflating, <b>uncompressing)</b> a gzip compressed response body.|$|R
5|$|Zodiac was {{the first}} {{production}} to employ the Filmstream camera in its native Filmstream mode, which records an <b>uncompressed</b> video stream, allowing for exceptional quality.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.3a was {{released}} on November 10, 2006, and had Cable and Sink modifications for type C, source termination recommendations, and removed undershoot and maximum rise/fall time limits. It also changed CEC capacitance limits, and CEC commands for timer control were brought back in an altered form, with audio control commands added. It also added the optional ability to stream SACD in its bitstream DST format rather than <b>uncompressed</b> raw DSD.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the features in common with HDMI (such as HDCP encrypted <b>uncompressed</b> high-definition video and eight-channel surround sound), MHL also adds the provision of power charging for the mobile device while in use, and also enables the TV remote to control it. Although support for these additional features requires connection to an MHL-enabled HDMI port, power charging can also be provided when using active MHL to HDMI adapters (connected to standard HDMI ports), provided there is a separate power connection to the adapter.|$|E
50|$|The 01234567 is {{the virus}} signature, {{and is used}} to make sure (if first-line-of-file = 01234567) the file is not already infected. The virus then asks for {{permission}} (ask-permission) to infect a random executable (get-random-executable-file). If the permission is granted, it compresses the executable (infect-executable), prepends itself to it (prepend), <b>uncompresses</b> the current executable file (<b>uncompress</b> the-rest-of-this-file) into a temporary file(tmpfile) and runs it (run tmpfile).|$|R
50|$|OpenSSL is {{open source}} {{software}} that can encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify, compress and <b>uncompress</b> CMS documents.|$|R
30|$|By <b>uncompressing</b> the JPEG format image, we {{obtain the}} {{intensity}} {{value of a}} JPEG image in the spatial domain.|$|R
5|$|Shadowrun was {{released}} in North America and Japan by Data East. In PAL regions, it was self-published by Beam Software as Laser Beam Entertainment. The 1994 Japanese version has a significantly longer introduction sequence than the English version {{of the game and}} also has a vertically <b>uncompressed</b> Shadowrun logo on the title screen. Other than that, it uses the same script as the North American and PAL editions, just with Japanese subtitles.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{implements}} the EIA/CEA-861 standards, which define video formats and waveforms, {{transport of}} compressed, <b>uncompressed,</b> and LPCM audio, auxiliary data, and implementations of the VESA EDID. CEA-861 signals carried by HDMI are electrically {{compatible with the}} CEA-861 signals used by the digital visual interface (DVI). No signal conversion is necessary, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used. The CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) capability allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one handheld remote control device.|$|E
5|$|Nausicaä was {{released}} on DVD by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on 22 February 2005 for Region 1. This DVD includes both the English dub and the Japanese audio track with English subtitles. Optimum Home Entertainment released the film in Region 2 and the Region 4 DVD is distributed by Madman Entertainment. A remastered Blu-ray sourced from a 6K filmscan {{was released}} on 14 July 2010 in Japan. It includes an <b>uncompressed</b> Japanese LPCM stereo track, an English dub and English subtitles. On 18 October 2010 a Blu-ray version was released in Region B by Optimum Home Entertainment. The film {{was released on}} Blu-ray in the United States and Canada on 8 March 2011 by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment. GKIDS was re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on 31 October 2017, along with Castle in the Sky.|$|E

50|$|Wii ISO Archive, {{abbreviated}} WIA, is {{an archive}} file format for Wii and GameCube games in ISO format. The compression {{is more efficient}} than WBFS and GCZ, but it is slower to (<b>un)compress.</b>|$|R
50|$|The UBV catalog {{data format}} is in plain text. After <b>uncompressing</b> by unzip or gunzip {{it can be}} seen by any text viewers or by the online ADC viewer. Specifications for the catalog format are {{provided}} at the download sites.|$|R
25|$|An {{administrative}} installation {{creates an}} <b>uncompressed</b> source image for a product, typically {{to be used}} for installing or running an application from a network location. An administrative installation is not a typical installation, in that it does not create any shortcuts, register COM servers, create an Add or Remove Programs entry, and so on. Often an administrative installation enables a user to install the product {{in such a way that}} its features run from the <b>uncompressed</b> installation source.|$|E
25|$|Audio {{is stored}} on the disc in Linear PCM format, which is either <b>un{{compressed}}</b> or losslessly compressed with MLP (Meridian Lossless Packing). The maximum permissible total bit rate is 9.6 Megabits per second. Channel/resolution combinations that would exceed this {{need to be}} compressed. In <b>uncompressed</b> modes, {{it is possible to}} get up to 96/16 or 48/24 in 5.1, and 192/24 in stereo. To store 5.1 tracks in 88.2/20, 88.2/24, 96/20 or 96/24 MLP encoding is mandatory.|$|E
25|$|The GIF {{encoding}} {{process can}} be modified to create a file without LZW compression that is still viewable as a GIF image. This technique was introduced originally {{as a way to}} avoid patent infringement. <b>Uncompressed</b> GIF can also be a useful intermediate format for a graphics programmer because individual pixels are accessible for reading or painting. An <b>uncompressed</b> GIF file can be converted to an ordinary GIF file simply by passing it through an image editor.|$|E
50|$|Smith Micro Software offers free {{downloads}} of StuffIt Expander for Mac and Windows, which expands (<b>uncompresses)</b> files compressed {{using the}} StuffIt and StuffIt X format, {{as well as}} many other compressed, encoded, encrypted and segmented formats. The shareware application DropStuff permits the compressing of files into the StuffIt X format.|$|R
50|$|PDFtk is a {{front end}} to the iText library (compiled to native code using GCJ), capable of splitting, merging, encrypting, decrypting, <b>uncompressing,</b> recompressing, and {{repairing}} PDFs. It {{can also be used}} to manipulate watermarks, metadata, and to fill PDF Forms with FDF Data (Forms Data Format) or XFDF Data (XML Form Data Format).|$|R
50|$|Some audio {{conversion}} functions can {{be performed}} by software or by specialized hardware. For example, an audio transcoder converts from one compressed audio format to another (e.g., MP3 to AAC) by means of two audio codecs: One for decoding (<b>uncompressing)</b> the source and one for encoding (compressing) the destination file or stream.|$|R
25|$|At , {{there was}} a four-way tie between aoTuV Vorbis, LAME MP3, WMA 9 Pro and AAC {{in a large scale}} test in January 2006, with each codec {{sounding}} close to the <b>uncompressed</b> music file for most listeners.|$|E
25|$|Opera Mini can run in Turbo and <b>Uncompressed</b> modes, in {{addition}} to Mini mode. In Turbo mode, the amount of data transferred is still much reduced by compression, but, unlike Mini mode, JavaScript is not intercepted by the server and works properly.|$|E
25|$|Administrative {{installations}} {{are also}} useful when creating a Windows Installer patch, as this requires <b>uncompressed</b> {{images of the}} earlier and current versions of a product in order to compute binary file differences. An administrative installation is performed by running the msiexec executable with the /a switch.|$|E
50|$|The use of archive formats like zip {{allows for}} {{directory}} traversal attacks: files in the archive {{can be written}} such that they overwrite files on the filesystem by backtracking. Code that <b>uncompresses</b> archive files can be written to check that the paths of the files in the archive do not engage in path traversal.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to perform {{lossless}} compression on the <b>uncompress</b> audio file audio to minimize file size without reducing the quality. The application is developed using the entropy encoding compression method with rice coding technique. For the result, the compression ratio is good enough and easy to be developed because the algorithm is quite simple.  </p...|$|R
50|$|The Webalizer can process CLF, Apache and W3C Extended {{log files}}, {{as well as}} HTTP proxy log files {{produced}} by Squid servers. Other log file formats are usually converted to CLF {{in order to be}} analyzed. In addition, logs compressed with either GZip (.gz) or BZip2 (.bz2) can be processed directly without the need to <b>uncompress</b> before use.|$|R
