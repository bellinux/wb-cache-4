25|$|The {{original}} {{illuminating apparatus}} was an 1885, lenticular 3rd order lens, manufactured by Sautter, Lemonnier & Company of France. The central drum measured 1 meter in diameter. It had six panels of which three were flashing panels. In each {{panel of the}} central drum there were seven elements; each panel above central drum had eleven prisms and four prisms below. The flashes were produced by the central revolving drum mounted on a chariot activated by a clock work system. The clock cord descended through the central column in the stairway. The mechanism was protected by a circular iron and glass case. The original light characteristic showed a white flash every 3 seconds and had an 18-mile range. In 1923 the light characteristics were changed. In 1945 the light was electrified. It was also changed into an automatic, <b>unwatched</b> <b>light</b> that exhibited the original characteristics. The structure was abandoned and boarded up. The lens {{was replaced by a}} 500mm lens. No record has been found which indicates that major structural changes or alterations were introduced in the dwelling. The decorative elements are purely neo-classic especially its cornices and pediment.|$|E
50|$|In 1946, in {{the wake}} of the tsunami disaster, a {{temporary}} <b>unwatched</b> <b>light</b> was established. The new permanent structure was completed in the early 1950s, and the temporary light was discontinued. The lighthouse was automated in 1971. A skeletal tower replaced the 1950s structure, and the fog signal was discontinued.|$|E
50|$|The McKay Island Lighthouse {{was built}} in 1907 to serve the timber industry. It had 5 Keepers of the Light, Angus McNeish, Merrit Strum, Joseph Harvey, Gord Inch, Mr Wing. It became an <b>unwatched</b> <b>light</b> in Oct 1955. On Oct 25th 2009 the range light was {{converted}} to solar power with LED bulbs. It is now a housekeeping lighthouse and available to rent as a unique accommodation.|$|E
50|$|The ship's main {{mission was}} in to place and repair aids to {{navigation}} equipment, {{in which they}} maintained approximately 255 during her time in service. The crew supported shore <b>lights,</b> <b>unwatched</b> <b>lights,</b> lighted buoys, unlighted buoys and beacons, and radio beacons on both the Panama Canals Atlantic and Pacific sides, the western Caribbean, Morro Puercas and the Jicarita Island Lights. In addition, Acacia rendered numerous salvage services involving vessels and persons in distress. The most notable was the rescue of the Brazilian training ship Almirante Saldanha. The vessel and its crew were given up for lost after the ship had run aground off San Juan Harbor Entrance 25 July 1938. Acacia rescued her crew, and the rescue created a celebration in Brazil and gained the attention of international officials.|$|R
50|$|The North Bluff {{light was}} {{converted}} to an <b>unwatched</b> automatic <b>light</b> on 21 June 1937 running on gas. The keeper {{was no longer}} employed but remained in the house. The North Bluff Lighthouse was closed on 17 June 1959, at the same time, the Middle Bluff Lighthouse was automated, running on gas. In April 1960, Woody Island was gazetted as a national park. The gazettal of Little Woody Island as a national park followed in February 1977.|$|R
50|$|The first {{automatic}} radiobeacon in the United States began {{service in}} 1928. Radiobeacons {{are still in}} use today, although most have recently been decommissioned as improved electronic navigational aids have become available. An automatic time clock for operating electric range lights came into use in 1926, and by 1933, a photo electric-controlled alarm device had been developed to check {{the operation of the}} <b>unwatched</b> electric <b>light.</b> A lightship staffed by remote control was equipped by the Lighthouse Bureau in 1934. It included a light, fog signal, and radiobeacon, all controlled by radio signals. A battery-powered buoy which gradually replaced the older acetylene buoys, was introduced in 1935. Because of the technological improvements mentioned above, and in particular the radiobeacon direction finder, the United States rose from sixth in shipping safety in 1920 to second in 1935, with only the Netherlands holding a better safety record.|$|R
