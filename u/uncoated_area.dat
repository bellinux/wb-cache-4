The use of zinc coatings also known as galvanizing on steel structures {{is a form of}} cathodic protection in which small scratches are expected to occur in the coating over time. As long as the scratches are fine, condensation moisture should not corrode the underlying steel as long as both the zinc and steel are in contact with the moisture, but if the scratch or <b>uncoated</b> <b>area</b> is larger than the droplets, then corrosion can occur. As long as there is moisture, the zinc will corrode and eventually disappear.|$|E
50|$|The {{resolution}} of a PSTM instrument is {{highly dependent on}} probe tip geometry and diameter. Probes are typically fabricated via chemical etching of an optical fiber in a solution of HF and can be apertured or apertureless. Using chemical etching, fiber tips with a curvature radius as low as 20 nm have been made. In apertured tips, {{the sides of the}} sharpened fiber are sputter coated in a metal or other material. This helps to limit tunnelling of photons {{into the side of the}} probe in order to maintain more consistent and accurate evanescent field coupling. Due to the rigidity of the fiber probe, even brief contact with the surface will destroy the probe tip. Larger probe tips have a greater degree of coupling to the evanescent field and will therefore have greater collection efficiency due to a larger area of the optical fiber interacting with the field. The primary limitation of a large tip is the increased probability of collision with rougher surface features as well as photon tunnelling into the side of the probe. A narrower probe tip is necessary to resolve more abrupt surface features without collision, however the collection efficiency will be reduced. Figure 3 shows that fiber probe with metal coating. In metal coated fiber probes, the diameter and geometry of the aperture, or <b>uncoated</b> <b>area</b> at the tip of the probe, determines the collection efficiency. Wider cone angles result in larger aperture diameters and shorter probe lengths, while narrower cone angles result in smaller aperture diameters and longer probes. Double tapered probetips have been developed in which a long, narrow region of the probe tapers into a tip with a wider cone angle. This provides a wider aperture for greater collection efficiency while still maintaining a long narrow probe tip capable of resolving abrupt surface features with low risk of collision.|$|E

40|$|A {{dual-phase steel}} was {{electrodeposited}} with Cu prior to reduction annealing {{in order to}} improve coating quality and resultant corrosion characteristics of the galvanized material. This pre-eletrodeposition process allowed a tenfold reduction in coating defects (typically found in <b>uncoated</b> <b>areas</b> and empty pores), thereby yielding a 8. 4 % coating weight gain and a noticeable decrease (24 %) in the average spangle diameter. However, the Cu pre-electrodeposition layer acted as an inter-diffusion barrier, thereby limiting Fe-Al interactions during galvanization, and resulted in the formation of imperfect Fe-Al compounds. Nevertheless, this Cu layer could extend the incubation time of the Fe-Zn phases. Consequently, the presence of this Cu electrodeposition layer could effectively prevent concentration polarization, thereby decreasing corrosion current density even after 4 days of immersion in 3. 5 % NaCl solution...|$|R

The catalytic runs were carried out with La/MgO catalyst packed inside the membrane tube. The C{sub 2 } yields obtained using the dense membrane reactor were less than 4 %. This may have resulted {{from the fact that the}} methane fed to the tube side was still exposed to the <b>uncoated</b> <b>area</b> of the dense membrane surface due to the incomplete coverage of the coating material (BaCe{sub 0. 6 }Sm{sub 0. 4 }O{sub 3 }).

40|$|The {{deposition}} and {{properties of}} electroless nickel composite coatings containing graphite, PTFE and chromium were investigated. Solutions were {{developed for the}} codeposition of graphite and chromium with electroless nickel. Solutions for the deposition of graphite contained heavy metal ions for stability, with non-ionic and anionic surfactants to provide wetting and dispersion of the particles. Stability for the codeposition of chromium particles was achieved by oxidation of the chromium. Thin oxide layers of 200 nm thick prevented initiation of the electroless reaction onto the chromium. A mechanism {{for the formation of}} electroless composite coatings was considered based on the physical adsorption of particles and {{as a function of the}} adsorption of charged surfactants and metal cations from solution. The influence of variables such as particle concentration in solution, particle size, temperature, pH, and agitation on the volume percentage of particles codeposited was studied. The volume percentage of graphite codeposited was found to increase with concentration in solution and playing rate. An increase in particle size and agitation reduced the volume percentage codeposited. The hardness of nickel-graphite deposits was found to decrease with graphite content in the as-deposited and heat treated condition. The frictional and wear properties of electroless nickel-graphite were studied and compared to those of electroless nickel-PTFE. The self-lubricating nature of both coatings was found to be dependent on the ratio of coated area to <b>uncoated</b> <b>area,</b> the size and content of lubricating material in the deposit, and the load between contacting surfaces. The mechanism of self-lubrication was considered, concluding that graphite only produced an initial lubricating surface due to the orientation of flakes, unlike PTFE, which produced true self-lubrication throughout the coating life. Heat treatment of electroless nickel chromium deposits at 850 oC for 8 and 16 hours produced nickel-iron-chromium alloy deposits with a phosphorus rich surface of high hardness.

The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the surface and cross section of TiN coated endodontic files. Materials and methods: TiN coated nickel–titanium endodontic files (EasyShape) were surface and cross-sectionally analyzed via scanning electron microscopy backscattered electron imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis in spot, area, and line scan modes. Results: Surface imaging revealed parallel oblong regions with higher mean atomic contrast, a finding attributed to increased Ni content. Cross-sectional analysis showed that the coating’s average total thickness was 0. 31  μm and consisted of a thin layered film. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis revealed the presence of Ti, Ni, N, and O in the coating, whereas only Ni and Ti were identified in the bulk of the file. Ti and O showed their peak compositions at the bulk/coating and coating/surface interfaces, respectively, whereas N displayed a rather constant content within the coated region. The N and O contents started increasing inner to the coating/bulk interface, denoting possible diffusion of both elements to the subcoating region.

Endothelialized grafts were anastomosed into the descending thoracal aorta of adult Chacma baboons. Untreated valve bioprostheses (n 4) served as controls. Forty days after implantation the prostheses were examined morphologically and immunohistochemically. Results: After implantation endothelialized prostheses showed a positive Factor VIII related antigen reaction by immunohisto-chemistry on all valve surfaces.

In the present work, bioactive and biocompatible organic-inorganic hybrid coatings were prepared using a sol-gel dip coating route.

The coatings {{were used to}} modify the surface of Ti 6 Al 4 V substrates {{in order to improve}} their wear and corrosion resistance. The chemical structure of the coatings was analyzed by attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.

The conformation of the adsorbed molecules at the solid-liquid interface was deduced from the molecular areas and the adsorbed layer thicknesses. Comparison of the adsorption results obtained from polystyrene latex and ibuprofen particles was made to explain the conformation {{difference between these two}} adsorbates. Sedimentation volumes and redispersibility values were the main criteria used to evaluate suspension stability. At low concentrations of {{surface active agents}}, hard caked suspensions were found, probably due to the attraction between the <b>uncoated</b> <b>areas</b> or, the mutual adsorption of the adsorbed molecules on the bare surface of the particles in the sediment. At high concentrations of hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, heavily caked sediments were attributed to network structure formation by the adsorbed molecules. An attempt was made to relate the characteristics of the suspensions to the potential energy of interaction curves. Generally, the agreement between theory and experiment was good, but for hydroxyethyl cellulose-ibuprofen systems discrepancies were found. Experimental studies showed that hydroxyethyl cellulose flocculated polystyrene latex over a rather wide range of concentrations; similarly, hydroxyethyl cellulose-ibuprofen suspensions were also flocculated.

Sinusoidal gratings with a corrugation-depth of 30 nm had been fabricated. Due to instabilities of the photoresist the reproducibility of the process was not satisfying. For three-section DBR-Lasers it is necessary to provide a coupling between active waveguides with gain and passive transparent ones. A method has been developed allowing the local diffusion induced disordering of quantum wells.

40|$|Zn- 55 %Al- 1. 5 %Si {{coated steel}} strip is {{manufactured}} by the continuous hot dipping process. An important {{difference in the}} processing of Zn- 55 %Al- 1. 5 %Si coated steel when compared with galvanised steel is the higher temperature of the molten alloy bath – 600 ºC for Zn- 55 %Al- 1. 5 %Si coatings versus 450 ºC for galvanised. This increase in temperature leads to an accelerated rate of evaporation of zinc into the pretreatment furnace, leading in turn to various processing difficulties. Zinc vapour in the pre-treatment furnace has long been implicated with defects known within the industry as pinholes and bare patches - <b>uncoated</b> <b>areas</b> where wetting does not occur between the strip and the molten alloy. Despite the association with zinc vapour, the exact mechanisms of pinhole and bare patch formation have not been clearly established. One possible mechanism of pinhole and bare patch formation is the direct reaction of zinc vapour with the strip surface. It has been suggested by industry experts that zinc vapour could condense on the strip, leaving a deposit that prevents wetting by molten Zn- 55 %Al- 1. 5 %Si alloy. It remains that little is understood of the fundamental nature {{of the interaction between}} zinc vapour and a steel substrate. The purpose of this research was to examine the rates and mechanisms of zinc vapour condensation on clean and oxidised steel substrates. Such information is essential for understanding the reactions that occur in the metal coating line furnace. It is intended that this research will strengthen the fundamental knowledge base upon which {{a solution to the problem}} can be developed. The experimental work conducted in this study was centred on condensing zinc vapour onto substrates under specific gaseous atmospheres at atmospheric pressure. A major part of the work involved the development of a technique for depositing zinc vapour onto a steel substrate and the design and construction of an experimental apparatus. Preliminary studies were undertaken to define the design criteria for an apparatus in which the rate of condensation of zinc vapour could be measured accurately and the interaction between zinc vapour and clean and oxidised steel substrates could be examined. In this probing exercise, modifications were made to a proven design of an apparatus designed to measure evaporation rates of metals in inert gas atmospheres was used. The preliminary experiments provided a wealth of essential knowledge required to design an experimental facility in which it was possible to accurately measure the rate of condensation of zinc vapour and to study the interaction between zinc vapour and the steel substrate, as well as their potential chemical reactions. This new apparatus was specifically developed for a quantitative assessment of zinc vapour deposition, and allowed the substrate and zinc vapour to be heated in independent, but interconnecting chambers. The exposure of the substrate to the zinc vapour could be controlled with precision, and it was possible to not only measure the zinc vapour condensation rates, but also to assess the effect of using oxidising and reducing gasses during preheating of the substrate. Under conditions of high undercooling, zinc vapour deposited by the island plus continuous thin film mode, while at higher substrate temperatures, close to that expected in the industrial process, the zinc deposited more slowly, and zinc islands did not form on the substrate within the first 60 seconds of exposure. Deposition of zinc vapour on an oxidised substrate occurred at a much higher rate than on a clean steel substrate. This increase in deposition rate has been attributed to a direct reaction occurring between the zinc vapour and the iron oxide without the formation of any liquid condensate. The reaction is: Fe 3 O 4 (s) + 4 Zn(v) ↔ 4 ZnO(s) + 3 Fe(s) This reaction will proceed to the right under sufficiently high partial pressures of zinc vapour, and at substrate temperatures both above and below the saturation temperature of the zinc vapour. It was observed that under sufficiently low partial pressures of zinc vapour, the above reaction is driven to the left. Zinc oxide has a determining influence on the wetting of the strip by the molten alloy. Immersion tests, wherein substrates deposited with zinc vapour were dipped into molten Zn- 55 %Al- 1. 5 %Si alloy, were carried out to examine the effect of various zinc vapour reactions on the quality of the coatings. Deposition of zinc vapour on both clean and oxidised steel surfaces had a detrimental effect on the coating quality. In cases where zinc was deposited onto a clean steel substrate prior to immersion in the coating alloy, pinholes resulted, while zinc vapour deposition on an oxidised surface prior to immersion led to large scale <b>uncoated</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

The {{migration}} of carbon in low-density, low-confinement plasmas of ASDEX Upgrade was studied by injecting 13 C {{into the main}} chamber of the torus {{at the end of}} the 2007 experimental campaign. A selection of standard tungsten-coated lower-divertor and main-chamber tiles as well as a complete set of lower-divertor tiles with an uncoated poloidal marker stripe were removed from one poloidal cross section and analyzed using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The poloidal deposition profiles of 13 C on both the tungsten-coated tiles and on the <b>uncoated</b> graphite <b>areas</b> of the marker tiles were measured and compared. For the W-coated lower-divertor tiles, 13 C was deposited mainly on the high-field side tiles, while barely detectable amounts of 13 C were observed on low-field side samples. In contrast, on the uncoated marker stripes the deposition was equally pronounced in the high-field and low-field side divertor. The marker-tile results are in agreement with those obtained from graphite tiles after the 2003 and 2005 13 C experiments in ASDEX Upgrade. In the case of W-coated tiles, the 13 C measurements were complemented by determining the total amount of deposited carbon (12 C) on the tiles, which also shows strong depositio...|$|R
40|$|Paper based {{materials}} have limited vapour barrier properties. Several techniques {{have been developed}} to overcome this limitation. One of such technique is the use of barrier dispersion coatings. These barriers are continuous and solid layers normally applied on the surface of paper materials. Dispersion coatings are normally composed of two materials; a latex binder and filler particles. The interaction between these materials creates tortuous pathways that reduce the diffusion of the permeant. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop an understanding of how the dispersion coatings can be designed to optimise the barrier properties of paper materials. In particular, the aim was to comprehend the effect of fillers added into dispersion coatings on the permeability with the purpose of developing of a model for predicting permeability. A number of models {{have been developed to}} predict the permeability of barrier films such as thermoplastic composites but none have been applied or developed for use on barrier dispersion coatings. These models are normally based on idealised geometries, where the fillers are arranged in either oriented or random ways. The heterogeneous characteristics of the barrier dispersion coatings, such as uneven coating thickness, particle size and the lower elongation of the fillers used in dispersion coatings limit the use of the existing models for the prediction of dispersion coating barrier performance. To develop a predictive model, the characterisation of aspects such as shape, size distribution and volume fraction of fillers in barrier coatings and their effect on the barrier performance were studied. The analysis of the geometry of fillers was carried out by image analysis from microscopy (scanning electron and light microscopes). This was carried out on three types of kaolin clays. The shapes, Feret diameters, and thicknesses of the clays were characterised. The filler shapes were elongated with an average ratio between the major and minor diameter being no larger than two. The Fourier series descriptor approximates the filler shape at the second harmonic. The Feret diameter and thickness were fitted to distribution curves. These distributions were used to define the fillers for generation of particle populations required for modelling. The particle populations can be based on either assuming representative filler shapes such as rectangular or elliptical plates or by the Fourier series descriptor. Characterisation of dispersion coatings were also carried out. The dispersion coatings were formulated by styrene-butadiene latex and mixed with the selected clays at several filler volume fractions and applied on 160 ∙− 2 linerboards. The characterisation was based on the measurement of water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) and oxygen transmission rate (O 2 TR). The coating thickness was also measured by scanning electron microscopy image analysis. The WVTR and O 2 TR were shown to be sensitive to the type of filler, volume fraction of filler, and thickness of the coatings. Both the WVTR and O 2 TR tended to be lower as the filler size, filler volume fraction, and coating thickness increased. The thickness of the coating was found to be dependent on the coating process (coated rod), coating formulation, and its variability on the linerboard topography. The proposed model predicted the relative permeability based on the estimation of permeant flux by the Fick’s first law through three dimensional coating geometries. The coatings were filled with rectangular plates randomly located. These plates were defined by distribution curves of maximum Feret diameter, elongation, and thickness of the selected clays. The amount of fillers in the coating was determined by part of filler volume fractions used for measurements of WVTR and O 2 TR. The sizes of the geometries were defined by the representative elemental volume estimated from the filler volume fraction and the variation of the predictions. The geometries were generated by programming in Matlab under particular conditions of coating formulation and exposure. The mathematical solution of the model was carried out by finite element method and solved by Comsol Multiphysics. As expected from the experimental characterisation of the coatings, the predictions indicated that the relative permeability reduced as the volume fraction of filler and the size of the clay increased; however, overestimation of the barrier properties were predicted. To understand the reasons for the discrepancy, several factors, that were not included in the conceptual model, were analysed. It was observed that the filler agglomeration and <b>uncoated</b> <b>areas</b> was the most significant factor that may affect the prediction of the relative permeability. Other factors such the uniformity of coating profile, and filler shape were found to have an effect on the prediction. Despite the discrepancy, the model was suitable for prediction of how to improve barrier performance trend. Thus, it was possible to evaluate different factors related to the barrier performance to find their best combination. In order to optimise the formulation of barrier dispersion coatings, sensitivity analyses were carried out based on factors that affect the permeability. Filler settling in the coating or coatings with two layers were found to provide a reduction of relative permeability. This technique also may reduce the material used for coating preparation and the occurrence of <b>uncoated</b> <b>areas.</b> However, these effects were smaller than the effect of filler agglomeration on the barrier performance. For this reason, future studies should be focused on the improvement of dispersion of fillers in the coating binder. The application of the model in other coating formulations must consider the definitions of the concepts used in the study in order to apply the correct information for running simulations. Because this model was the first approach developed for dispersion coatings, several aspects were fully not explored in this study. In future research may be focused on the improvement of filler geometry characterisation, dispersion of fillers in the coating binder, incorporation of coating irregularities in the conceptual model, and incorporation of commercial coatings additives in the model. These points may increase the complexity of the model; however, it is expected that such complexity will be practical to be included in the model in the near future due to advances in computing capability for FEM simulations...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{method has}} been devised for using directed, hyperthermal beams of oxygen atoms and ions to impart desired textures to {{the tips of}} polymethylmethacrylate [PMMA] optical fibers {{to be used in}} monitoring the glucose content of blood. The improved method incorporates, but goes beyond, the method described in Texturing Blood-Glucose- Monitoring Optics Using Oxygen Beams (LEW- 17642 - 1), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 29, No. 4 (April 2005), page 11 a. The basic principle of operation of such a glucose-monitoring sensor is as follows: The textured surface of the optical fiber is coated with chemicals that interact with glucose in such a manner as to change the reflectance of the surface. Light is sent down the optical fiber and is reflected from, the textured surface. The resulting change in reflectance of the light is measured as an indication of the concentration of glucose. The required texture on the ends of the optical fibers is a landscape of microscopic cones or pillars having high aspect ratios (microscopic structures being taller than they are wide). The average distance between hills must be no more than about 5 mso that blood cells (which are wider) cannot enter the valleys between the hills, where they would interfere with optical sensing of glucose in the blood plasma. On the other hand, the plasma is required to enter the valleys, and high aspect ratio structures are needed to maximize the surface area in contact with the plasma, thereby making it possible to obtain a given level of optical glucose-measurement sensitivity with a relatively small volume of blood. There is an additional requirement that the hills be wide enough that a sufficient amount of light can propagate into them and, after reflection, can propagate out of them. The method described in the cited prior article produces a texture comprising cones and pillars that conform to the average-distance and aspect-ratio requirements. However, a significant fraction of the cones and pillars are so narrow that not enough light can propagate along them. The improved method makes it possible to form wider cones and pillars while still satisfying the average-distance and aspect-ratio requirements. In the improved method, as in the previously reported method, multiple optical fibers are first bundled together for simultaneous texturing of their distal tips. However, prior to texturing by exposure to an oxygen beam, the tips are first coated by vapor deposition of a thin, sparse layer of aluminum: The exposure to the aluminum vapor must be short enough (typically of the order of seconds) so that the aluminum nucleates into islands separated by <b>uncoated</b> <b>areas.</b> The coated tips are textured by exposure to a directed beam of hyperthermal (kinetic energy > 1 eV) oxygen atoms and/or ions in a vacuum chamber, as in the previously reported method. The aluminum islands partially shield the underlying PMMA from oxidation and erosion by the beam, so that the cones or pillars remaining after texturing are wider than they would otherwise be. To some extent, the dimensions of the hills and the distances between them can be tailored through choice of the thickness of the aluminum coat and/or the oxygen-beam fluence. The figure illustrates an example of texturing of the tip of a PMMA optical fiber without and with prior aluminum coating...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of neural electrodes over chronic periods is poor with degrading signal-to-noise ratio and low biocompatibility. Consequently, electrodes require modification {{to improve their}} performance, biostability and biocompatibility. A large variety of doped conducting polymers have been proposed for optimising neural electrodes, but to date, none have achieved the required biostability and biocompatibility necessary for human application. Dextran sulfate is used as an antithrombotic and may be of use in improving neural electrode biocompatibility. Poly- 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene was successfully doped with dextran sulfate (PEDOT-DS) by electropolymerisation on neural electrode arrays. Deposited films increased the electrode area and displayed a rough morphology compared to <b>uncoated</b> electrodes. Electrode <b>area</b> and charge density were obtained using microscopy and reduction of Ru(NH 3) 63 +. Deposition charge, geometrical and linear diffusion electroactive areas were strongly correlated with deposition time. The charge density calculated from the geometric area was greater on PEDOT-DS modified electrodes than unmodified and PEDOT-para-toluene sulfonate (PEDOT-pTs) modified electrodes. The charge density calculated from the linear diffusion electroactive area was smaller on PEDOT-DS modified electrodes than unmodified and PEDOT-pTs modified electrodes. The charge density of the PEDOT-DS modified electrodes was dependant on the electrode area...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) During {{immersion}} of a steel substrate in {{a metallic}} coating bath reactions occur between the iron in the substrate and the zinc or aluminium in the bath, forming an interfacial alloy layer. This alloy layer provides the vital meallurgical bond {{and is therefore}} critical {{to the integrity of}} the coated product. An experimental investigation of the influence of the substrate entry temperature on the initial solid-liquid contacting mechanisms {{and its impact on the}} alloy layer formation in hot dip metallic coating is presented. The objective of the study was to link the initial wetting to the interfacial resistances to both heat and mass transfer and to resolve their effect on the subsequent formation of the interfacial alloy layer. An experimental technique, based on the sessile drop deposition method, was developed to study the initial dynamic wetting of metal droplets on steel substrates. Unique to the experimental design was the ability to perform non-isothermal experiments where the substrate temperature was varied from ~ 250 °C to ~ 800 °C. The influence of the substrate temperature on the formation of hot dip coatings was studies using an immersion technique. A thermocouple instrumented substrate was developed to enable millisecond resolution measurements of the thermal response during the transient stages of solid-liquid contact. Interfacial heat fluxes and thermal interfacial resistances were calculated from the temperature responses. Reactive Zn- 55 Al- 1. 6 Si and Zn baths and non-reactive Pb baths were chosen for study. Under isothermal conditions, reactive Zn- 55 Al- 1. 6 Si and Zn droplets and non-reactive Pb droplets were found to wet clean metallic substrates within the first millisecond of contact. Under non-isothermal conditions, the substrate preheat temperature had a dramatic influence on the wetting. Wetting was improved as the substrate preheat temperature was increased and approached the bath temperature, beyond which the improvement in wetting was negligible. The transition point for non-wetting to wetting was related to substrate temperatures close to the solidification temperatures of the respective droplets. The maximum heat fluxes reflected the changing wetting conditions at the solid-liquid interface, as well as encapsulating the heat released by the exothermic interfacial reactions in the reactive Zn- 55 Al- 1. 6 Si and Zn baths. The minimum thermal interfacial resistance decreased by an order of magnitude (1 x 10 - 4 to 2 x 10 - 5 m 2 K/W) as the substrate preheat temperature was increased from room to bath temperature. The reduction in the resistance was directly attributed to improved contact through improved wetting. The observed increase in the minimum thermal interfacial resistance for preheat temperatures greater than the bath temperature, in the Zn- 55 Al- 1. 6 Si and Zn baths, was attributed to the increased heat of reaction. Measurements of the alloy layer thickness, for the Zn- 55 Al- 1. 6 Si and Zn samples immersed for ~ 1 second, showed increased alloy layer thickness with an increase in the substrate preheat temperature. The number of <b>uncoated</b> <b>areas</b> on the substrates were also reduced as the wetting was improved through an increase in temperature. No coating was withdrawn when the substrates were immersed in the Pb bath as there was no interfacial reaction. Consideration of the phenomena occurring at the interface on the microscopic scale clarified the initial solid-liquid contacting mechanisms. It was proposed that the contact area available to heat and mass transfer consisted of points of intimate contact and points of non-contact and was related to the measured "macroscopic" contact angle. The fractional contact area was estimated using a contact angle function derived in classical nucleation theory. The thermal contact resistance was calculated using the estimated fractional area, and was defined as the resistance to heat transfer, by conduction, through the points of intimate contact. A fundamental relationship between the contact angle and the thermal contact resistance was established. Further, interface conditions at low preheat temperatures resulted in poor wetting and were conducive to solidification and a change from the initial solid-liquid contact to a solid - solid contact. The solid-solid contact was reflected in high interfacial resistances. This mechanism correlated well with the calculated melt interfacial temperatures that showed the average melt temperature could cool close to or even below the solidification temperature of the bath at low preheat temperatures. At higher temperatures the wetting was good and conditions were more conducive to interfacial reactions and increased mass transfer at the interface, evinced by low interfacial resistances and increased alloy layer thickness...|$|R
40|$|Structures of {{all three}} {{poliovirus}} (PV) serotypes (PV 1, PV 2, and PV 3) complexed with their cellular receptor, PV receptor (PVR or CD 155), were determined by cryoelectron microscopy. Both glycosylated and fully deglycosylated CD 155 exhibited similar binding sites and orientations in the viral canyon for all three PV serotypes, showing that all three serotypes use a common mechanism for cell entry. Difference maps between the glycosylated and deglycosylated CD 155 complexes determined the sites of the carbohydrate moieties that, in turn, helped to verify {{the position of the}} receptor relative to the viral surface. The proximity of the CD 155 carbohydrate site at Asn 105 to the viral surface in the receptor-virus complex suggests that it might interfere with receptor docking, an observation consistent with the properties of mutant CD 155. The footprints of CD 155 on PV surfaces indicate that the south rim of the canyon dominates the virus-receptor interactions and may correspond to the initial CD 155 binding state of the receptor-mediated viral uncoating. In contrast, the interaction of CD 155 with the north rim of the canyon, especially the region immediately outside the viral hydrophobic pocket that normally binds a cellular “pocket factor, ” may be critical for the release of the pocket factor, decreasing the virus stability and hence initiating <b>uncoating.</b> The large <b>area</b> of the CD 155 footprint on the PV surface, in comparison with other picornavirus-receptor interactions, could be a potential limitation on the viability of PV escape mutants from antibody neutralization.
