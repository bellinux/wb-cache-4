30|$|A {{quadratic}} {{utility function}} is widely applied in economic and finance theory. The main {{advantage of a}} quadratic utility function is its tractability, {{and this is the}} main reason why the quadratic function is applied as an objective function for various optimization problems in economics and finance. In particular, modern investment theory and practice are mainly based on the mean–variance portfolio theory developed by Markowitz [7], where the analysis is based on the quadratic function of portfolio return. The analysts in practice apply the mean–variance-efficient portfolios for asset allocation. Recently, Sharpe [9] showed that the mean–variance portfolio allocation has similar results to that of the expected <b>utility</b> <b>asset</b> allocation if we consider the quadratic utility whose risk aversion is measured by the variance of portfolio return.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} how {{departure from}} normality {{may affect the}} allocation of assets. A Taylor series expansion of the expected utility allows to focus on certain moments and to compute numerically the optimal portfolio allocation. A decisive advantage {{of this approach is}} that it remains operational even if a large number of assets is involved. We show that under moderate non-normality the mean-variance criterion provides a good approximation of the expected utility maximization. In contrast, under large departure from normality (as found in some stocks in mature markets or in some stock indices in emerging markets), the mean-variance criterion may fail to approximate the expected utility correctly. In such cases, the three-moment or four-moment optimization strategies may provide a good approximation of the expected <b>utility.</b> <b>Asset</b> allocation; Stock returns; Non-normality; Utility function...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Selecting {{the best}} cable and {{installation}} conditions taking {{account of the}} environment and customer needs, is a key challenge for cable designers and <b>utility</b> <b>asset</b> managers. In South East Asia there has been a ready acceptance of XLPE for Power Distribution and Transmission cables but the ‘in-service ’ performance has not been without problems. With the increasing demands by consumers for a better environment and much greater system reliability of supply, utilities throughout the region are grappling with the inevitable increase in demand for undergrounding and the need to improve the overall performance of this expensive asset. The challenge is how to do this in the most cost effective manner but avoid the mistakes made with some underground installations having limited service life. This paper proposes to outline a number of issues and solutions in this regard with particular emphasis on the South East Asian region where the performance of underground cable systems is currently under review...|$|E

Campbell and Cochrane (1999) derive a consumption based habit <b>utility</b> <b>asset</b> pricing model and calibrate it to aggregate US stock market data. However, they do not test whether their model {{is consistent with a}} larger cross section of asset returns. We test their model using the methodology of Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) and Burnside (1994). In contrast to previous studies, we find that for reasonable parameter values, the model's stochastic discount factor is inside the Hansen-Jagannathan bounds and therefore satisfies the necessary conditions for a valid stochastic discount factor. We trace the difference between our results and previous studies to the method used to estimate the model's parameters and the parameter values themselves.

40|$|Utility {{infrastructure}} {{is vital to}} the daily life of modern society. As the vast majority of urban <b>utility</b> <b>assets</b> are buried underneath public roads, the need to install/repair <b>utility</b> <b>assets</b> often requires opening ground with busy traffic. Unfortunately, at present most excavation works are carried out without knowing exactly what is where, which causes far more street breakings than necessary. This research studies how maximum benefit can be gained from the existing knowledge of buried assets. The key challenge here is that utility data is heterogeneous, which arises due to different domain perceptions and varying data modelling practices. This research investigates factors which prevent utility knowledge from being fully exploited and suggests that integration techniques can be applied for reconciling semantic heterogeneity within the utility domain. In this paper we discuss the feasibility of a common utility ontology to describe underground assets, and present techniques for constructing a basic utility ontology {{in the form of a}} thesaurus. The paper also demonstrates how the utility thesaurus developed is employed as a shared ontology for mapping utility data. Experiments have been performed to evaluate the techniques proposed, and feedback from industrial partners is encouraging and shows that techniques work effectively with real world utility data...|$|R
40|$|Operating {{strategies}} of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) systems are developed and evaluated from a utility, and end-user perspective using a fully integrated SOFC-CHP system dynamic model that resolves the physical states, thermal integration and overall {{efficiency of the}} system. The model can be modified for any SOFC-CHP system, but the present analysis is applied to a hotel in southern California based on measured electric and heating loads. Analysis indicates that combined heat and power systems can be operated to benefit both the end-users and the utility, providing more efficient electric generation as well as grid ancillary services, namely dispatchable urban power. Design and operating strategies considered in the paper include optimal sizing of the fuel cell, thermal energy storage to dispatch heat, and operating the fuel cell to provide flexible grid power. Analysis results indicate that with a 13. 1 % average increase in price-of-electricity (POE), the system can provide the grid with a 50 % operating range of dispatchable urban power at an overall thermal efficiency of 80 %. This grid-support operating mode increases the operational flexibility of the SOFC-CHP system, which may make the technology an important <b>utility</b> <b>asset</b> for accommodating the increased penetration of intermittent renewable power. © 2009 Elsevier B.

Digital Object Identifier: 10. 1109 /PES. 2007. 386289 The task of monitoring asset status and optimizing asset utilization for the T&D industry, given millions of assets {{and hundreds of thousands of}} miles of power lines distributed geographically over millions of square miles, seems particularly challenging if not impossible. Given the traditionally high cost of sensing and communications, the grid has minimal ‘smarts’ with much of the intelligence located at major substations. Dramatic reductions in sensor, computing and communications costs, coupled with significant performance enhancements has raised the possibility of realizing widely and massively distributed sensor networks (SNs) to monitor <b>utility</b> <b>asset</b> status. Under NEETRAC funding, a survey was conducted to review existing sensor technologies and products, and to estimate the possibility of extending these to realize distributed SNs. Possible applications for such SNs were also explored, as was the issue of cost point at which such networks would become commercially viable. This paper provides an overview of the highlights from the detailed survey that was conducted, and identifies ‘gaps’ in currently available sensor technologies, both from a performance and cost point...|$|E
40|$|<b>Utility</b> <b>asset</b> {{managers}} and engineers {{are concerned about}} the life and reliability of their power transformers which depends on the continued life of the paper insulation. The ageing rate of the paper is affected by water, oxygen and acids. Traditionally, the ageing rate of paper has been studied in sealed vessels however this approach does not allow the possibility to assess the affect of oxygen on paper with different water content. The ageing rate of paper has been studied for dry paper in air (excess oxygen). In these experiments we studied the ageing rate of Kraft and thermally upgraded Kraft paper in medium and high oxygen with varying water content. Furthermore, the oxygen content of the oil in sealed vessels is low which represents only sealed transformers. The ageing rate of the paper has not been determined for free breathing transformers with medium or high oxygen content and for different wetness of paper. In these ageing experiments the water and oxygen content was controlled using a special test rig to compare the ageing rate to previous work and to determine the ageing effect of paper by combining temperature, water content of paper and oxygen content of the oil. We found that the ageing rate of paper with the same water content increased with oxygen content in the oil. Hence, new life curves were developed based on the water content of the paper and the oxygen content of the oil...|$|E
