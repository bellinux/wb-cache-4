5|$|In 1952–53, Montreal and Detroit battled {{for first}} place with Detroit coming out on top {{by the end of}} the season. In the first round of the playoffs the heavily favored Detroit Red Wings were <b>upset</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Boston Bruins and Montreal won a close seven-game series over the Chicago Black Hawks.

5|$|The second eruptive period, the Cougar Stage, started 20,000 {{years ago}} and lasted for 2,000 years. Pyroclastic flows of hot pumice and ash along with dome growth {{occurred}} during this period. Another 5,000 years of dormancy followed, only to be <b>upset</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the Swift Creek eruptive period, typified by pyroclastic flows, dome growth and blanketing of the countryside with tephra. Swift Creek ended 8,000 years ago.|$|E
50|$|It can {{be argued}} that these <b>upsets</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 14-seeds {{launched}} the NCAA Tournament's reputation for having unknown teams surprise well-known basketball powers, and both happened on the same day. Indiana's stunning loss would be part of the climax in the best-selling book A Season On The Brink.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was <b>upset</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E
5|$|After {{clinching}} {{a spot in}} {{the championship}} game, Tech defeated ACC opponent Duke, then prepared for a game against traditional rival Georgia before heading to Jacksonville for the ACC championship. In the game against Georgia, the No. 16 Yellow Jackets were <b>upset</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> unranked Bulldogs, who intercepted Tech quarterback Reggie Ball twice and held him to just 42passing yards in the game. Georgia's victory marked the sixth consecutive victory in the rivalry and sent Tech into the ACC Championship Game on a down note.|$|E
5|$|After {{he testified}} {{before a grand}} jury in New York, he was indicted on perjury charges. Although Spivey was not convicted when the case went to trial in 1953, he was {{prevented}} from competing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) afterward. Spivey instead played professionally for various minor league teams. In 10 Eastern Basketball League (EBL) seasons, his teams won three championships. Spivey retired in 1968 and became a businessman, working in sales and operating restaurants. <b>Upset</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> accusations against him in the early 1950s, he was reclusive in his final years.|$|E

5|$|Brock {{sent the}} twelve mutineers {{and the seven}} deserters to Quebec for court martial. The mutineers had planned to jail all the {{officers}} (save Sheaffe, who was to be killed) and to cross the Niagara River into the U.S. at Queenston. Seven soldiers were subsequently executed by firing squad. The mutineers testified that {{they were forced to}} such measures by the severity of Sheaffe's command. They said if they had continued under Brock's command, they would never have taken such action. Brock was evidently <b>upset</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news that the conspirators had been shot. In a botched execution, the firing squad discharged their weapons at too long a distance, so that the condemned men were not killed instantly.|$|E

5|$|The 2014 {{was held}} {{for the first time}} in the {{independent}} Belarus in spite of concerns of the human rights abuses perpetuated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> authoritarian government.

5|$|Due to {{increasing}} dissatisfaction with Everman {{over the course}} of the Bleach tour, Nirvana canceled the last few dates and drove back to Washington. No one told Everman he was fired at the time, while Everman later claimed that he actually quit the group. Although Sub Pop did not promote Bleach as much as other releases, it was a steady seller. However, Cobain was <b>upset</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> label's lack of promotion and distribution for the album.|$|E
5|$|During the November 11, 2006, {{game against}} Kansas State, McCoy {{suffered}} a stinger shoulder injury while rushing {{for a touchdown}} on the opening drive against Kansas State.

The Longhorns fell behind by as much as 21 points before Snead brought them back to within 3, finally falling in an <b>upset</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Wildcats 45–42. There was speculation that Snead might be the starter for the final regular season game, because it was unknown whether McCoy would return for the Longhorns season closer against rival Texas A on November 24, 2006. However, McCoy was cleared to play the game against the Aggies.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the early}} exit in the Houston Regional {{due to the}} <b>upset</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Aggies, Humber {{looked forward to the}} Major League Baseball Draft. Niemann, and Townsend were all {{selected}} along with Humber in the first eight picks of the 2004 MLB Draft— the first time three teammates had ever gone so early in the same draft. Only twice had three teammates been taken in the first round, most recently when Steve Hosey, Tom Goodwin and Eddie Zosky of the Fresno State Bulldogs were selected {{in the first round of}} the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. Teammate David Aardsma, a relief pitcher, was also selected in the first round.|$|E
5|$|Harlan argued to Goebbels that Söderbaum, {{having just}} given birth, {{was too weak}} to take on the role. Goebbels countered that a special room could be set up as a nursery and that a wet-nurse could be hired to care for the infant. He further offered to halt {{shooting}} if Söderbaum became ill. Harlan later reported that Söderbaum was so <b>upset</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entire affair that she considered fleeing back to her native Sweden to avoid having to play the part of Dorothea. In the end, however, she decided to stay and performed the role.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Chapman made {{a routine}} {{visit to a}} dentist, who found a small, but {{malignant}} tumour {{on one of his}} tonsils, leading to both being removed via a tonsillectomy.

Chapman had several chemotherapy treatments and surgeries during the final months of his life, but ultimately the cancer was declared inoperable. According to his brother, Chapman was visibly <b>upset</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> death of his mother that July, by which time he was terminally ill. Shortly afterwards, Chapman filmed scenes for the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of Flying Circus, the final time he appeared on television.|$|E

5|$|On 27 August 1964, the British {{aircraft}} carrier HMS Victorious {{and her two}} destroyer escorts sailed through the Sunda Strait, an international waterway claimed by Indonesia, en route to Australia. <b>Upset</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> casual warning the British had given of the ships' impending passage through the Strait (a telephone call made two days before), the lack of mention of the carrier in the warning, and wary {{of the possibility that}} the British were attempting to provoke them into a violent response, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided two days later to attempt to bar the warships from making the return journey to Singapore, scheduled for the middle of September.|$|E
