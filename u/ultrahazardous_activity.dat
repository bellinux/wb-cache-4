5000|$|An <b>ultrahazardous</b> <b>activity</b> in {{the common}} law of torts {{is one that is}} so {{inherently}} dangerous that a person engaged in such an activity can be held strictly liable for injuries caused to another person, even if the person engaged in the activity took every reasonable precaution to prevent others from being injured. In the Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts 2d, the term has been abandoned in favor of the phrase [...] "inherently dangerous activity." ...|$|E

However, unusual provisions of the Price-Anderson Act serve to shield nuclear power {{and nuclear weapons}} plants and associated activities from strict liability unless the federaq agency regulating the activity determins that a special from of strict liability can be applied...|$|E

5000|$|Furthermore, {{an adult}} {{trespasser}} who is injured {{while on a}} defendant's property cannot sue under a theory of strict liability, even if the landowner was engaged in <b>ultrahazardous</b> <b>activities,</b> such as the keeping of wild animals, {{or the use of}} explosives. Instead, the trespasser must prove that the property owner intentionally or wantonly injured the plaintiff to recover. The exception is a child who is trespassing to play on ultra-hazardous items on the land. Since these trespassers are considered [...] "anticipated" [...] they are excepted under the doctrine of attractive nuisance.|$|R
5000|$|Strict {{liability}} torts {{are brought}} for injuries resulting from <b>ultrahazardous</b> <b>activities,</b> {{for which the}} defendant will be held liable {{even if there was}} no negligence on his/her part. Strict liability also applies to some types of product liability claims and to copyright infringement and some trademark cases. Some statutory torts are also strict liability, including many environmental torts. The term [...] "strict liability" [...] refers {{to the fact that the}} tortfeasor's liability is not premised on their culpable state of mind (whether they knew or intended to accomplish the wrongful act, or violated a standard of care by doing so,) but, instead, strictly on the conduct itself or its result.|$|R
40|$|The {{fifteen years}} since Fleming James {{addressed}} {{the question of}} whether manufacturers should be liable without negligence have seen a remarkable expansion in the scope of strict liability in the law of torts, yet the very courts which have been the leaders in this trend have been consistently troubled by the question of how far strict liability should extend within the areas in which it is being applied. While strict liability of the manufacturer for product defects, for example, has been announced in jurisdiction after jurisdiction, in many jurisdictions this has simply led to a morass of questions regarding the definition of 2 ̆ 2 defect 2 ̆ 2 and how liability for a defect relates to (a) adequacy of warnings, (b) unexpected or improper use, (c) assumption of risk, and even (d) contributory negligence. Nor is this at all surprising. Strict liability has never meant that the party held strictly liable is to be a general insurer for the victim no matter how or where the victim comes to grief. General insurance was not the rule in classical instances of strict liability, such as <b>ultrahazardous</b> <b>activities,</b> or in legislatively mandated instances, such as workmen 2 ̆ 7 s compensation, and it is not the rule in the recent instances of application such as products liability. The questions which the courts now find themselves asking (and being asked) in the new areas of application, such as products liability, involve the same basic issue as did equally difficult questions faced in traditional areas of strict liability, which were couched in words such as 2 ̆ 2 natural or unnatural use 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 arising out of {{and in the course of}} employment. 2 ̆ 2 The issue is just where strict liability should stop...|$|R
