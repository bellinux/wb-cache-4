25|$|The {{most recent}} episodes of the network's shows are usually made {{available}} on WATCH ABC, Hulu and ABC on Demand {{the day after}} their original broadcast. In addition, ABC on Demand (like the video-on-demand television services provided by the other U.S. broadcast networks) disallows fast forwarding of accessed content. Restrictions implemented by Disney–ABC Television Group on January 7, 2014 restrict streaming {{of the most recent}} episode of any ABC program on Hulu and WATCH ABC until eight days after their initial broadcast, in order to encourage live or same-week (via both DVR and cable on demand) viewing, with day-after-air streaming on either service limited to subscribers of participating pay television providers (such as Comcast, Verizon FiOS and Time Warner Cable) using an ISP account via an authenticated <b>user</b> <b>login.</b>|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, the BBC also {{announced}} that users {{would eventually be}} required to sign in with a BBC ID account to use the service. CBBC and CBeebies television content is exempt from the login requirement, but all other content requires a <b>user</b> <b>login.</b> In May 2017, iPlayer began to encourage users to login with a BBC ID in preparation for this change. Media outlets suggested that the account requirement was intended to help the BBC collect personal information {{that could be used}} to trace those who are evading TV Licensing whilst using iPlayer; Andrew Scott, launch director of the ongoing myBBC initiative, stated that the BBC may use account email addresses, along with existing methods, to help identify iPlayer users who do not hold a television licence. However, he noted the account system was primarily intended to provide personalization features across BBC properties, such as content recommendations on iPlayer, and the ability to continue watching a programme on one device from where it was left off on another.|$|E

500|$|On {{compatible}} hardware, Windows 8.1 {{also features}} a transparent [...] "device encryption" [...] system based on BitLocker. Encryption begins {{as soon as a}} user begins using the system; the recovery key is stored to either the user's Microsoft account or an Active Directory login, allowing it to be retrieved from any computer. While device encryption is offered on all versions of Windows 8.1 unlike BitLocker (which is exclusive to the Pro and Enterprise editions), device encryption requires that the device meet the Connected Standby specification and have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 chip. Windows 8.1 also introduces improved fingerprint recognition APIs, which allows <b>user</b> <b>login,</b> User Account Control, Windows Store and Windows Store apps to use enrolled fingerprints as an authentication method. A new kiosk mode known as [...] "Assigned Access" [...] was also added, allowing a device to be configured to use a single app in a restricted environment. Additionally, Windows Defender includes an intrusion detection system which can scan network activity for signs of malware. Windows 8.1 also allows third-party VPN clients to automatically trigger connections.|$|E
