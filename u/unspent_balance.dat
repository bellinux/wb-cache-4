50|$|CBO {{estimated}} in March 1999 that the TANF basic block grant (authorization to spend) would total $16.5 billion annually through 2002, {{with the amount}} allocated to each state based on the state's spending history. These block grant amounts {{proved to be more}} than the states could initially spend, as AFDC and TANF caseloads dropped by 40% from 1994 to 1998 due to the booming economy. As a result, states had accumulated surpluses which could be spent in future years. States also had the flexibility to use these funds for child care and other programs. CBO also estimated that TANF outlays (actual spending) would total $12.6 billion in fiscal years 1999 and 2000, grow to $14.2 billion by 2002, and reach $19.4 billion by 2009. For scale, total spending in FY 2000 was approximately $2,000 billion, so this represents around 0.6%.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{motivated}} by {{a concern for the}} cost-effectiveness of anti-poverty outlays; much of its focus is on the targeting of Rural Public Works (RPW) and the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) over the period 1987 ± 93. It is argued that benefits to the rural poor of larger outlays on these two major anti-poverty programmes are likely to be limited, given their mistargeting. Large sections of the rural poor were not covered in 1987. Worse, the non-poor were in a majority among the participants. Although the evidence is mixed, there was a worsening of the targeting of both RPW and IRDP, with RPW maintaining a slight superiority, over the period 1987 ± 93. Yet IRDP was more cost-effective in both years, using a somewhat limited measure of cost-effectiveness. Large <b>unspent</b> <b>balances</b> due largely to slow disbursal of allocations and bunching of expenditure in a few months are linked to changes in cost-effectiveness. Wastage and diversion of funds are unavoidable, in a context of corrupt bureaucracy and capture of locally elected bodies such as Panchayats by a few influential persons. Short of drastic changes in the design and implementation of RPW and IRDP, substantially larger outlays may thus accomplish little in terms of poverty alleviation...|$|R

Moréno is looking for clues to lead him to the Vampires, and reads in a paper that a Fontainebleau notary has been murdered by them; as he happens to possess a gaze with a terrible {{hypnotic}} power, he takes control of his new maid, Laura, to turn her into his slave. Meanwhile, Philipe and Mazamette happen to see a newsreel on the murder inquest, in which they spot Irma Vep and the Grand Vampire. They cycle to Fontainebleau to investigate. En route they spot an American tourist, Horatio Werner, riding fast into the forest, and follow him. He places a box {{under one of the}} boulders, and they take it. The Grand Vampire, who is staying in the Royal Hunt Hotel under the pseudonym of Count Kerlor, along with Irma in disguise as his son, Viscount Guy, reads in a paper that George Baldwin (Émile Keppens), an American millionaire, has been robbed of $200,000. Whoever can capture the criminal, Raphael Norton, who has fled to Europe with the actress Ethel Florid, will be awarded the <b>unspent</b> <b>balance</b> of the loot. [...] "Kerlor" [...] notices that Mr and Mrs. Werner, who are staying at the hotel, are distressed by this notice, and concludes that Mr. Werner is Raphael Norton. Philipe and Mazamette arrive at the hotel and find that the Vampires are based there. In a different hotel they force open the box and find Baldwin’s stolen money inside. Moréno comes to the Royal Hunt in disguise. While the Grand Vampire tells the hotel guests a story, Irma breaks into the Werners' suite, finding a map leading to the box in the forest. When she leaves, she is captured and chloroformed by Moréno, who takes the map. While his gang take Irma away, he dresses his hypnotized maid, Laura, as Irma and tells her to give the Vampires the map. Once one of the Vampires (Miss Édith) follows the map to get the treasure, Moréno’s gang ambushes her, only to find that Philipe has already taken it. Moreno demands that the Grand Vampire ransom Irma Vep. In the early morning, the police raid the hotel and find that Werner is actually Norton, so Philipe and Mazamette win the money. Moréno falls in love with Irma and decides not to return her to the Grand Vampire. Instead, he hypnotizes her and causes her to write a confession of her involvement in the murders of the Fontainbleau notary (in this episode), Metadier (episode 4), the ballerina Marfa Koutiloff (episode 2), and Dr. Nox (episode 1).

ON THURSDAY 23rd SEPTEMBER MAURITIUS DEFENCE MATTERS Present:- The Secretary of State (in the Chair) Lord Taylor Sir Hilton Poynton Sir John Rennie Mr. P. R. Noakes Mr. J. Stacpoole Sir S. Ramgoolam Mr. S. Bissoondoyal Mr. J. M. Paturau Mr. A. R. MohamedTHE SECRETARY OF STATE expressed his apologies for the unavoidable postponements and delays which some delegations at the Constitutional Conference had met with earlier in the day. He {{explained that he was}} required to inform his colleagues of the outcome of his talks with Mauritian Ministers about the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago at 4 p.m. that afternoon and was therefore anxious that a decision should be reached at the present meeting.2. He expressed his anxiety that Mauritius should agree to the establishment of the proposed facilities, which besides their usefulness for the defence of the free world, would be valuable to Mauritius itself by ensuring a British presence in the area. On the other hand it appeared that the Chagos site was not indispensable and there was therefore a risk that Mauritius might lose this opportunity. In the previous discussions he had found himself caught between two fires: the demands which the Mauritius Government had made, mainly for economic concessions by the United States, and the evidence that the United States was unable to concede these demands. He had throughout done his best to ensure that whatever arrangements were agreed upon should secure the maximum benefit for Mauritius. He was prepared to recommend to his colleagues if Mauritius agreed to the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago:-* (i) negotiations for a defence agreement between Britain and Mauritius;* (ii) that if Mauritius became independent, there should be an understanding that the two governments would consult together {{in the event of a}} difficult internal security situation arising in Mauritius;* (iii) that the British Government should use its good offices with the United States Government in support of Mauritius request for concessions over the supply of wheat and other commodities* (iv) that compensation totalling up to £3m. should be paid to the Mauritius Government over and above direct compensation to landowners and others affected in the Chagos Islands.This was the furthest the British Government could go. They were anxious to settle this matter by agreement but the other British Ministers concerned were of course aware that the islands were distant from Mauritius, that the link with Mauritius was an accidental one and that it would be possible for the British Government to detach them from Mauritius by Order in Council.3. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM replied that the Mauritius Government were anxious to help and to play their part in guaranteeing the defence of the free world. He asked whether the Archipelago could not be leased, (THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that this was not acceptable). MR. BISSOONDOYAL enquired whether the Islands would revert to Mauritius if the need for defence facilities there disappeared. THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he was prepared to recommend this to his colleagues.4. MR. PATURAU said that he recognised the value and importance of an Anglo-Mauritius defence agreement, and the advantage for Mauritius if the facilities were established in the Chagos Islands, but he considered the proposed concessions a poor bargain for Mauritius.5. MR. BISSOONDOYAL asked whether there could be an assurance that supplies and manpower from Mauritius would be used so far as possible. THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that the United States Government would be responsible for construction work and their normal practice was to use American manpower but he felt sure the British Government would do their best to persuade the American Government to use labour and materials from Mauritius.6. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM asked the reason for Mr. Koenig’s absence from the meeting and MR. BISSOONDOYAL asked whether the reason was a political one, saying that if so this might affect the position.7. Mr. MOHAMED made an energetic protest against repeated postponements of the Secretary of State's proposed meeting with the M.C.A. Committee of Action, which he regarded as a slight to his party.8. THE SECRETARY OF STATE repeated the apology with which he had opened the meeting, explaining that it was often necessary in such conferences to concentrate attention on a delegation which was experiencing acute difficulties, while he himself had been obliged to devote much time to a crisis in another part of the world.9. MR MOHAMED then handed the Secretary of State a recent private letter from Mauritius which disclosed that extensive misrepresentations about the course of the Conference had been published in a Parti Mauricien newspaper. THE SECRETARY OF STATE commented that such misrepresentations should be disregarded, and that MR. MOHAMED had put forward the case for his community with great skill and patience.10. MR. MOHAMED said that his party was ready to leave the bases question to the discretion of H.M.G. and to accept anything which was for the good of Mauritius. Mauritius needed a guarantee that defence help would be available nearby in case of need.11. At SIR S. RAMGOOLAM’s request the Secretary of State repeated the outline he had given at a previous meeting of the development aid which would be available to Mauritius between 1966-1968, viz. a C.D. & W. Development & Welfare allocation totalling £2.4 million (including carryover) thus meaning that £800,000 a year would be available by way of grants in addition Mauritius would have access to Exchequer loans, which might be expected to be of the order of £1m. a year, on the conditions previously explained. He pointed out that Diego Garcia was not an economic asset to Mauritius and that the proposed compensation of £3m. would be an important contribution to Mauritius development. There was no chance of raising this figure.12. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM said that there was a gap of some £4m. per year between the development expenditure which his government considered necessary in order to enable the Mauritian economy to “take off” and the resources in sight, and enquired whether it was possible to provide them with additional assistance over a 10 year period to bridge this gap.13. THE SECRETARY OF STATE mentioned the possibility of arranging for say £2m. of the proposed compensation to be paid in 10 instalments annually of £200,000.14. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM enquired about the economic settlement with Malta on independence and was informed that these arrangements had been negotiated in the context of a special situation for which there was no parallel in Mauritius.15. SIR H. POYNTON pointed out that if Mauritius did not become independent within three years, the Colonial Office would normally consider making a supplementary allocation of C.D. & W. grant money to cover the remainder of the life of the current C.D. & W. Act, i.e. the period up to 1970. He added that if Mauritius became independent, they would normally receive the <b>unspent</b> <b>balance</b> of their C.D. & W. allocation in a different form and it would be open to them after the three year period to seek further assistance such as Britain was providing for a number of independent Commonwealth countries.16. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM said that he was prepared to agree in principle to be helpful over the proposals which H.M.G. had put forward but he remained concerned about the availability of capital for development in Mauritius and hoped that the British Government would be able to help him in this respect.17. MR. BISSOONDOYAL said that while it would have been easier to reach conclusions if it had been possible to obtain unanimity among the party leaders, his party was prepared to support the stand which the Premier was taking. They attached great importance to British assistance being available in the event of a serious emergency in Mauritius.18. MR. PATURAU asked that his disagreement should be noted. The sum offered as compensation was too small and would provide only temporary help for Mauritius economic needs. Sums as large as £25m. had been mentioned in the British press and Mauritius needed a substantial contribution to close the gap of £4-5m. in the development budget. He added that since the decision was not unamimous sic, he foresaw serious political trouble over it in Mauritius.19. THE SECRETARY OF STATE referred to his earlier suggestion that payment of the monetary compensation should be spread over a period of years.20. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM said that he was hoping to come to London for economic discussions in October. The Mauritius Government’s proposals for development expenditure had not yet been finalised, but it was already clear that there would be a very substantial gap on the revenue side.21. SIR H. POYNTON said that the total sum available for C.D. & W. assistance to the dependent territories was a fixed one and it would not be possible to increase the allocation for one territory without proportionately reducing that of another.22. Summing up the discussion, the SECRETARY OF STATE asked whether he could inform his colleagues that Dr. Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Mr. Bissoondoyal and Mr. Mohamed were prepared to agree to the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago on the understanding that he would recommend to his colleagues the following:-(i) negotiations for a defence agreement between Britain and Mauritius; (ii) in the event of independence an understanding between the two governments that they would consult together in the event of a difficult internal security situation arising in Mauritius; (iii) compensation totalling up to £3m. should be paid to the Mauritius Government over and above direct compensation to landowners and the cost of resettling others affected in the Chagos Islands; (iv) the British Government would use their good offices with the United States Government in support of Mauritius’ request for concessions over sugar imports and the supply of wheat and other commodities; (v) that the British Government would do their best to persuade the American Government to use labour and materials from Mauritius for construction work in the islands;(vi) the British Government would use their good offices with the U.S. Government to ensure that the following facilities in the Chagos Archipelago would remain available to the Mauritius Government as far as practicable: (a) Navigational and Meteorological facilities; (b) Fishing Rights; (c) Use of Air Strip for emergency landing and for refuelling civil planes without disembarkation of passengers. (vii) that if the need for the facilities on the islands disappeared the islands should be returned to Mauritius; (viii) that the benefit of any minerals or oil discovered in or near the Chagos Archipelago should revert to the Mauritius Government.23. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM said that this was acceptable to him and Messrs. Bissoondoyal and Mohamed in principle but he expressed the wish to discuss it with his other ministerial colleagues.24. THE SECRETARY OF STATE pointed out that he had to leave almost immediately to convey the decision to his own colleagues and LORD TAYLOR urged the Mauritian Ministers not to risk losing the substantial sum offered and the important assurance of a friendly military presence nearby.25. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM said that Mr. Paturau had urged him to make a further effort to secure a larger sum by way of compensation, but the Secretary of State said there was no hope of this.26. SIR J. RENNIE said that while he had hoped that Mauritius would be able to obtain trading concessions in these negotiations, this was now ruled out. It was in the interest of Mauritius to take the opportunity offered to ensure a friendly military presence in the area. What was important about the compensation was the use to which the lump sum was put.27. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM mentioned particular development projects, such as a dam and a land settlement scheme, and expressed the hope that Britain would make additional help available in an independence settlement.28. SIR H. POYNTON said that the Mauritius Government should not lose sight of the possibility of securing aid for such purposes from the World Bank, the I.D.A. and from friendly governments. While Mauritius remained a colony such powers as Western Germany regarded Mauritius economic problems as a British responsibility but there was the hope that after independence aid would be available from these sources. When Sir S. Ramgoolam suggested that he had said that grants could be extended for up to 10 years, Sir H. Poynton pointed out that he had only indicated that when the period for which the next allocation had been made expired, it would be open to the Mauritius Government to seek further assistance, from Britain, even though Mauritius had meanwhile become independent. It would not be possible to reach any understanding at present beyond saying that independence did not preclude the possibility of negotiating an extension of Commonwealth aid.29. At this point the SECRETARY OF STATE left for 10, Dowing Street sic, after receiving authority from Sir S. Ramgoolam and Mr. Bissoondoyal to report their acceptance in principle of the proposals outlined above subject to the subsequent negotiation of details. Mr. Mohamed gave the same assurance, saying that he spoke also for his colleague Mr. Osman. Mr. Paturau said he was unable to concur.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of Health Sector Public Expenditure Review {{for fiscal year}} (FY) 2011 (PER FY 11) {{was to assess the}} budgetary allocations and expenditures to inform stakeholders about progress made in key health financing milestones over the 2006 / 07 – 2011 / 12 period. Specifically, the Health Sector PER sets out to provide: A review of PER FY 10 findings and actions taken by the sector in response to those findings, indicating unaccomplished/pending actions, and identifying follow-up actions for FY 11, Analysis of the trend of recurrent and development budget and expenditures for the past five FYs, Analysis of the trends in the sources of funding for the health sector for the past five FYs, Analysis of budget and expenditure trends for the different sectoral and subsectoral levels including the central-local government split, Assessment of budget performance (allocation versus actual spending) by classification (development and recurrent), funding sources (government funding and foreign funding), and different levels (central and local), Analysis of the core or priority areas/items of expenditure as highlighted in the Health Sector Strategic Plan III (HSSP-III) and the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (MKUKUTA), A detailed analysis of income and expenditure at the district level. Public health sector financing has more than doubled over the five-year period under review, but the share of the health budget in the total government budget still remains below the 15 percent recommended under the Abuja Declaration. The health sector budget has increased in nominal terms from TZS 520 billion in 2006 / 07 to TZS 1. 164 trillion in 2011 / 12. However, the share of public spending on health out of total government expenditure (excluding Consolidated Fund Services [CFS]) declined from 13. 1 percent in 2009 / 10 to 12. 0 percent in 2010 / 11; while the share of public health allocation in the total government budget (excluding CFS) also declined from 12. 3 percent in the 2010 / 11 budget to 10. 0 percent in the 2011 / 12 budget. This level of expenditure (which includes donor funding) is below the Abuja target, despite the government’s stated commitment to increase the share of health allocation in the budget to 15 percent of the total government budget. 1 In 2010 / 11, public health expenditures were only about 2. 7 percent of GDP, while public health budgetary allocations were down to 2. 8 percent of GDP in the 2011 / 12 budget compared to 3. 5 percent of GDP in the 2010 / 11 budget. Per capita public health allocations have almost doubled in nominal terms between 2006 / 07 and 2010 / 11, but the real increase was only modest. Further, per capita health spending is still low, and falls significantly short of the World Health Organization (WHO) -recommended target of USD 54 to address health challenges, and is well below the HSSP-III projections of USD 15. 75 per capita spending by 2009 / 10. In nominal terms, public health allocations per capita increased by 108 percent from TZS 13, 785 (USD 11) in 2006 / 07 to TZS 28, 673 (USD 19. 80) in 2010 / 11 before falling (by 7 percent) to TZS 26, 563 (USD 17. 30) in 2011 / 12. Actual per capita health spending increased by 58 percent from TZS 13, 698 (USD 11) in 2006 / 07 to TZS 21, 635 (USD 14. 90) in 2010 / 11. In real terms, however, per capita allocations for health increased by 70 percent from TZS 9, 069 (USD 7. 30) to a peak of TZS 15, 425 (USD 10. 60) in 2010 / 11 before falling to TZS 13, 348 (USD 8. 70). Actual public health per capita expenditures rose from TZS 9, 012 (USD 7. 20) to a peak of TZS 12, 818 (USD 8. 80) in 2009 / 10, and down to TZS 11, 639 (USD 8) in 2010 / 11, which is a 10 percent decline. Government funding remains the dominant source of health sector financing, but the share of foreign financing in health has increased noticeably during the period under review. 3 Government contribution to health expenditures declined from 71 percent in 2006 / 07, reaching a low of 53 percent in 2010 / 11, and is estimated at 59 percent of the 2011 / 12 budget. However, because of much higher execution of local funds in the implementation of the budget, the share of government funds in the actual health spending has always remained above 60 percent throughout the review period. The share of external health financing increased from 29 percent in the 2006 / 07 budget to a maximum of 47 percent in the 2010 / 11 budget, and is estimated at 41 percent in the 2011 / 12 budget. Also, {{it is worth noting that}} foreign funding still accounts for a dominant (88. 8 percent) share of the development budget in health interventions. This trend points to a potential threat to the sustainability of health sector financing in case of unanticipated declines in donor funding in the sector. The performance of the health sector budget execution was satisfactory throughout the review period, but it still remains vulnerable to low execution of foreign funds, and persistent challenges in the execution of the development budget, notably the low absorption capacity of spending units, non-release of funds, delays in the release of funds, and lengthy and cumbersome procurement processes. The execution of the health sector budget was generally good throughout the review period, with annual average execution of 91 percent, except for 2010 / 11 when only 75 percent of the budgeted funds were utilized. The performance of the recurrent budget has been generally higher than the development budget, which recorded a very low execution of 57 percent in 2010 / 11. Performance of government funds was generally higher than foreign funds for the past three fiscal years. With regard to foreign funds, the execution of basket funds was better than the non-basket funds, which recorded a very low execution of 51 percent in 2010 / 11. Budget performance continues to be hindered by among other factors: the low absorption capacity of the spending units; delays in the release of funds; non-release of the funds; over-ambitious budgeting (given the past performance); and lengthy and cumbersome procurement processes, which affect particularly the implementation of development projects. The overall performance of the recurrent budget for the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) departments is excellent (92. 7 percent), except for the Social Welfare and Finance and Accounts Departments that only have average performance, and the Internal Audit Department, which has poor performance with an execution of only about 34 percent. The poor performance of the Audit Department is due to non-release of the allocated funds. Non-release of funds to the Audit Department threatens the functioning of the unit and the entire public financial management (PFM) system of the MoHSW. Health sector financing continues to be concentrated at the central level, and the pace towards decentralization has slowed in 2011 / 12. However, there is a significant share of XVII health financing that is centrally controlled, but goes to the local level in the form of pharmaceutical and medical supplies. The share of public health financing controlled at the central level has declined generally, from 64 percent in 2006 / 07 to 60 percent in 2011 / 12. However, if the pharmaceutical component is excluded from the central spending, the share of health financing controlled at the central level goes down to 37 percent in 2011 / 12. The share of medicines, which eventually go to the local level, has increased from 15 percent of the health budget in 2006 / 07 to 28 percent in 2010 / 11, before declining to a projected 20 percent of the health budget in 2011 / 12. The other sources of funding at the local level (which are mostly off-budget) increased from 7 percent in 2009 / 10 to 14 percent of the council budget in the 2010 / 2011. Actual expenditure from councils’ own resources remained constant at 2 percent, which raises a concern about the sustainability of health interventions should there be a shock to the funds from the central level (government and development partners). Complementary health financing continues to grow in importance, but only a small proportion of the Tanzanian population (about 14 percent) is currently insured with the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) and Community Health Fund (CHF) based on the current estimates from NHIF reports. Between 2007 / 08 and 2010 / 11, receipts from the Health Service Fund (HSF) have almost doubled. Although this could be reflecting an increase in population, it is also reflecting the fact that majority of the population is not insured; only 14 percent of Tanzanians are insured (NHIF and CHF combined). Further, the HSF still has unspent balances, which in 2010 / 11 were equivalent to 20 percent of the receipts, a decline from 26 percent observed in 2009 / 10. In both 2009 / 10 and 2010 / 11, more was spent than collected which resulted in the decrease of the <b>unspent</b> <b>balance.</b> NHIF continues to accumulate huge reserves although compared to 2008 / 09 figures, they have declined from 63 percent to 59 percent of the total annual income. These funds (HSF and NHIF) should be used to improve health services promptly while maintaining prudent, actuarially determined reserves. Holding very large reserves defeats the whole purpose of collecting these funds. Following the accreditation of the Drug Dispensing Outlets, and improvements in the procurement of medicines by the Local Government Authorities (LGAs) from the Medical Stores Department (MSD), access to tracer drugs has significantly improved in the LGAs. Access to tracer drugs from the sampled health facilities was found to be high. This reflects efforts made by councils in procuring medicines from the Medical Stores Department but also accrediting Part I Pharmacies and Accredited Drug Dispensing Outlets (ADDOs) to serve the NHIF/CHF clients. These pharmacies and ADDOs are key conduits for making medicine accessible to rural marginalized areas, and more efforts should be made to work with ADDOs. This is also an area where the CHF funds could be used effectively. Following the improvement in the budget allocation for training and deployment of human resource for health, the overall human resource gap has narrowed to 41 percent in 2010 / 11 from 65 percent in 2006 / 07. The improvement in budget allocation for training and deployment of human resources for health has helped in bringing the overall human resource gap down to 41 percent in 2010 / 11. In terms of cadres, the gap for assistant medical officers (AMOs) has almost closed (73 percent available), followed by laboratory technicians (63 percent available), but the shortage of dentists and pharmacy technicians still persists (only 35 percent and 59 percent available, respectively). Despite the government’s stated commitment to increase the share of health sector financing in the government budget to at least the 15 percent recommended in the Abuja Declaration, this has yet to be achieved, and the share has fallen below 12 percent in 2011 / 12. It is important that this commitment is honored with the deserved political will if progress is to be made in addressing the key challenges in the sector, particularly in human resources (recruitments to fill the existing gap identified in the HSSP-III and retention of workers) and infrastructure. Execution of the development budget continues to be plagued by several impediments, including: low absorption capacity; non-release or delayed release of funds; and complexities in the procurement processes. Efforts should be increased to address these impediments to ensure smooth implementation of the budget. Although the delivery of health services is largely concentrated at the local government level, the largest share of health sector financing is still managed at the central level. Despite this observation, it is worth noting that a significant portion of the funds managed at the central level eventually goes down to the local level, particularly in the form of drugs and medical supplies. Nonetheless, the process of decentralization should be expedited, with particular focus on capacity strengthening for local government authorities in the areas of financial management and procurement. The poor performance of the Internal Audit Unit of MoHSW due to non-release of the allocated funds threatens the functioning of the department and the entire PFM system of the MoHSW. Thus, it is imperative to release funds as budgeted so as to enable the unit to perform its functions effectively. Efforts to promote enrollment of households in the CHF are evident at different levels. Lessons from best-performing districts and programs such as Tanzanian German Program to Support Health and the Swiss Development Cooperation-funded CHF Strengthening program in Dodoma should be harnessed and applied nationwide. The major actors here include NHIF and LGAs. Accreditation of Part I Pharmacies and ADDOs to serve the NHIF/CHF clients is an excellent move. These pharmacies and ADDOs are key conduits for making medicine accessible to rural, marginalized areas and more efforts should be made to work with ADDOs. The NHIF and Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority are key actors here. The government should intensify efforts to strengthen the linkages between CHF and NHIF in working towards universal coverage. ...|$|E
