The <b>unsharp</b> <b>masking,</b> or sharpening, operation used in image editing software is a high-boost filter, a generalization of high-pass.

25|$|There is {{support for}} several methods of {{sharpening}} and blurring images, including the blur and sharpen tool. The <b>unsharp</b> <b>mask</b> tool {{is used to}} sharpen an image selectively— it only sharpens areas of an image that are sufficiently detailed. The <b>Unsharp</b> <b>Mask</b> tool is considered to give more targeted results for photographs than a normal sharpening filter. The Selective Gaussian Blur tool works in a similar way, except it blurs areas of an image with little detail.|$|R

If we can preserve or retain most of the edge information in a binary image, the image will be informative and look natural. To preserve edge information in a binary image, the edges in the grey image must be enhanced using some effective <b>unsharp</b> <b>masks.</b> We propose a new method of generating <b>unsharp</b> <b>masks,</b> which can be used to enhance the edges in an image effectively. Once an effective <b>unsharp</b> <b>mask</b> is obtained, we apply it on an input grey image to get enhance the edges in the image.

5000|$|The [...] "unsharp" [...] of {{the name}} derives {{from the fact that}} the {{technique}} uses a blurred, or [...] "unsharp", negative image to create a mask of the original image. [...] The <b>unsharped</b> <b>mask</b> is then combined with the positive (original) image, creating an image that is less blurry than the original. The resulting image, although clearer, may be a less accurate representation of the image's subject. In the context of signal processing, an <b>unsharp</b> <b>mask</b> is generally a linear or nonlinear filter that amplifies the high-frequency components of a signal.|$|R

50|$|A {{derivative}} of contrast masking is <b>unsharp</b> <b>masking,</b> an unusual {{term for a}} process intended to increase the apparent sharpness (acutance) of an image. <b>Unsharp</b> <b>masking</b> uses a blurred form of the image to increase contrast along regions of moderate contrast difference.

40|$|Several {{areas like}} remote sensing, {{biomedical}} analysis, and computer vision require good image contrast and details for better interpretations and diagnosis’s. In the literature various image enhancement algorithms {{have been proposed}} to improve the perceptual aspects of the image for poorly contrasted images. The perceptual appearance of an image may be significantly improved by modifying the high frequency components to have better edge and detail information in the image. The proposed scheme is a modification of simple <b>unsharp</b> <b>mask</b> image enhancement technique. We propose a simple method to improve the pitfalls of the existing <b>unsharp</b> <b>mask</b> technique. The idea is to remove impulsive noise while preserving the edges and to have better contrast for visual perception.

40|$|Parallel {{primitives}} libraries {{reduce the}} burden of knowledge required for developers to begin developing parallel applications and accelerating them with OpenCL. Unfortunately some current libraries implement primitives as individual kernels and so incur a high performance cost in off-chip memory operations for intermediate variables. We describe a methodology for creating efficient domain specific embedded languages {{on top of the}} SYCL for OpenCL standard for parallel programming. Using this approach, a small example language was developed which provides an environment for composing image processing pipelines from a library of more primitive operations, while retaining the capability to generate a single kernel from a complex expression, and so eliminate unnecessary intermediate loads and stores to global memory. This elimination of global memory accesses leads to a 2. 75 x speedup over implementing an <b>unsharp</b> <b>mask</b> in OpenCLIPP. We give details of our domain specific embedded language, and provide experimental performance measurements of both primitive performance and an <b>unsharp</b> <b>mask</b> operation composed of multiple primitives...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work digital filters {{are used to}} reduce the {{measurement}} uncertainty of the microscopic particle image velocimetry (µPIV) technique. Analysis shows that single pixel random noise and low frequency background noise in the µPIV recordings are much stronger than in the usual macroscopic PIV recordings. The effects of several different low- and high-pass filters on the evaluation accuracy of a correlation-based interrogation algorithm with continuous window shift and central difference image correction are investigated. Simulations show that the 3 × 3 -pixel rectangular smooth filter can reduce effectively the evaluation error resulting from single pixel random noise. The <b>unsharp</b> <b>mask</b> is a powerful tool to reduce the evaluation error caused by low frequency background noise.

40|$|We present three {{research}} {{topics for}} improving the perceptual quality of halftone images. The first two topics are for developing high quality halftone algorithms with the consideration of computational efficiency. The third topic is for enhancing continuous-tone images as a preprocessing step before printing them. ^ In Ch. 1, using the iterative direct binary search algorithm, we compare the halftone texture quality provided by four different HVS models that {{have been reported in}} the literature. Choosing one HVS model as the best for DBS, we then develop an approximation to that model which significantly improves computational performance while minimally increasing the complexity of the code. By varying the parameters of this model, we find that it is possible to tune it to the gray level being rendered, and to thus yield superior halftone quality across the tone scale. We then develop a dual-metric DBS algorithm that effectively provides a tone-dependent HVS model without a large increase in computational complexity. ^ In Ch. 2, we propose a novel halftoning method of hybrid LUT/screen halftoning which achieves both of high quality and compressibility using only point processes. Experimental results show that the halftone images from our hybrid LUT/screen algorithm have the quality comparable to those from direct binary search (DBS) algorithm with unprecedented performance of halftone compression. ^ In Ch. 3, we consider the problem of restoring a noisy blurred image using an adaptive <b>unsharp</b> <b>mask</b> filter. Starting with a set of very high quality images, we use models for both the blur and the noise to generate a set of degraded images. With these image pairs, we optimally train the strength parameter of the <b>unsharp</b> <b>mask</b> to smooth flat areas of the image and to sharpen areas with detail. ^ We characterize the blur and the noise for a specific hybrid analog/digital imaging system in which the original image is captured on film with a low-cost analog camera. A silver-halide print is made from this negative; and this is scanned to obtain a digital image. Our experimental results for this imaging system demonstrate the superiority of our optimal <b>unsharp</b> <b>mask</b> compared to a conventional <b>unsharp</b> <b>mask</b> with fixed strength. ...|$|R
