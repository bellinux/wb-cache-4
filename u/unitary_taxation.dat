The parent {{and all of its}} subsidiaries are viewed as though they were a single entity (unitary combination), and the method is then also known as worldwide <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation.</b> In the US, most states have adopted water's edge combined reporting which restricts the taxable group to just US domestic corporations and excludes [...] "overseas business organization", i.e., unitary foreign affiliates and foreign parents.|$|E
5000|$|Formulary apportionment, {{also known}} as <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation,</b> is a method of allocating profit earned (or loss incurred) by a {{corporation}} or corporate group to a particular tax jurisdiction in which the corporation or group has a taxable presence. It is an alternative to separate entity accounting, under which a branch or subsidiary within the jurisdiction is accounted for as a separate entity, requiring prices for transactions with {{other parts of the}} corporation or group to be assigned according to the arm's length standard commonly used in transfer pricing. In contrast, formulary apportionment attributes the corporation's total worldwide profit (or loss) to each jurisdiction, based on factors such as the proportion of sales, assets or payroll in that jurisdiction.|$|E
5000|$|Several US states allow, {{but do not}} mandate, that a {{corporate}} group include foreign entities {{for the purpose of}} assessing factors used in formulary apportionment ("worldwide unitary combination"). California, for example, began to accept worldwide unitary combination in the 1940s. However, its attempt to require such combination led to strong protests from US trading partners. The UK-US double taxation treaty signed in 1975 included a provision to prohibit US states from [...] "taking into account the income, deductions, receipts, or out-goings of a related enterprise" [...] in the United Kingdom or any other country for the purpose of determining tax liability. However, the US Senate, whose consent was required to ratify the treaty, rejected this provision, and the treaty was amended by a protocol in 1979. [...] The Supreme Court explicitly held worldwide unitary combination as constitutional in separate cases in 1983 and 1994 (Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Board). [...] In 1985 the United Kingdom passed retaliatory legislation which would have overridden the UK-US tax treaty and denied significant UK tax benefits to corporations headquartered in US states which applied worldwide <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation.</b> This and further pressure from foreign governments, the executive branch and multinational corporations led US states to adopt a [...] "water's edge" [...] limitation on unitary combination, allowing taxpayers to decide for themselves whether or not to include foreign entities in their combined reporting.|$|E

40|$|The {{international}} tax system, {{designed a}} century ago, has not {{kept pace with}} the modern multinational entity rendering it ineffective in taxing many modern businesses according to economic activity. One of those modern multinational entities is the multinational financial institution (MNFI). The recent global financial crisis provides a particularly relevant and significant example {{of the failure of}} the current system on a global scale. The modern MNFI is increasingly undertaking more globalised and complex trading operations. A primary reason for the globalisation of financial institutions is that they typically ‘follow-the-customer’ into jurisdictions where international capital and international investors are required. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently reported that from 1995 - 2009, foreign bank presence in developing countries grew by 122 per cent. The same study indicates that foreign banks have a 20 per cent market share in OECD countries and 50 per cent in emerging markets and developing countries. Hence, most significant is that fact that MNFIs are increasingly undertaking an intermediary role in developing economies where they are financing core business activities such as mining and tourism. IMF analysis also suggests that in the future, foreign bank expansion will be greatest in emerging economies. The difficulties for developing countries in applying current international tax rules, especially the current traditional transfer pricing regime, are particularly acute in relation to MNFIs, which are the biggest users of tax havens and offshore finance. This paper investigates whether a <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> approach which reflects economic reality would more easily and effectively ensure that the profits of MNFIs are taxed in the jurisdictions which give rise to those profits. It has previously been argued that the uniqueness of MNFIs results in a failure of the current system to accurately allocate profits and that unitary tax as an alternative could provide a sounder allocation model for international tax purposes. This paper goes a step further, and examines the practicalities of the implementation of <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> for MNFIs in terms of the key components of such a regime, along with their their implications. This paper adopts a two-step approach in considering the implications of <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> as a means of improved corporate tax coordination which requires international acceptance and agreement. First, the definitional issues of the unitary MNFI are examined and second, an appropriate allocation formula for this sector is investigated. To achieve this, the paper asks first, how the financial sector should be defined for the purposes of <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> and what should constitute a unitary business for that sector and second, what is the ‘best practice’ model of an allocation formula {{for the purposes of the}} apportionment of the profits of the unitary business of a financial institution...|$|E

40|$|In 2013 the OECD {{released}} its 15 point Action plan {{to deal with}} base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). In that plan it was recognised that BEPS has a significant effect on developing countries. This is because the lack of tax revenue can lead to a critical underfunding of public investment that would help promote economic growth. To this end, the BEPS project is aimed at ensuring an inclusive approach to take into account not only views of the G 20 and OECD countries but also the perspective of developing nations. With this focus in mind and in the context of developing nations, {{the purpose of this article}} is to consider a possible solution to profit shifting which occurs under the current transfer pricing regime, with that solution being <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> with formulary apportionment. It does so using the finance sector as a specific case for application. Multinational financial institutions (MNFIs) play a significant role in financing activities of their clients in developing nations. Consistent with the ‘follow-the-client’ phenomenon which explains financial institution expansion, these entities are increasingly profiting from activities associated with this growing market. Further, not only are MNFIs persistent users of tax havens but also, more than other industries, have opportunities to reduce tax through transfer pricing measures. This article establishes a case for an industry specific adoption of <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> with formulary apportionment as a viable alternative to the current regime. It argues that such a model would benefit not only developed nations but also developing nations which are currently suffering the effects of BEPS. In doing so, it considers the practicalities of such an implementation by examining both definitional issues and a possible formula for MNFIs.

40|$|The {{international}} {{tax system}} needs a paradigm shift. The rules devised over 80 years ago treat the {{different parts of}} a multinational enterprise {{as if they were}} independent entities, although they also give national tax authorities powers to adjust the accounts of these entities. This creates a perverse incentive for multinationals to create ever more complex groups in order to minimise taxes, exploiting the various definitions of the residence of legal persons and the source of income. While states may attempt to combat these strategies, they also compete to offer tax incentives, many of which facilitate such techniques to undermine other countries’ taxes. Several alternative approaches have been identified, which start from the economic reality that multinationals operate as unitary firms. These include residence-based worldwide taxation, under which the ultimate home country of a multinational taxes its worldwide profits but with a credit for equivalent foreign taxes paid; a destination-based cash flow tax, which attributes the tax base to the country of ultimate sales to third parties; and <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> with formulary apportionment, which apportions the firm’s consolidated profits according to factors reflecting its real presence in each country.

40|$|For {{more than}} twenty years there have been discussions on the issue of {{multinational}} corporations shifting profits from high- to low-tax jurisdictions, with resulting gains to them from the resulting reduction in their effective tax rate. Underpinning much of this debate has been an implicit assumption that, first of all, profits are a fixed and constant known factor in this tax base-shifting equation; and, secondly, that by adopting consistent international financial reporting standards (IFRSs) the risk of arbitraging on tax is removed from this equation. Arguments for <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> have particularly advanced this assumption. We seek to show that the relationship between tax and financial reporting is now remote, and that no jurisdiction that we can identify relies upon unadjusted traditional accounting profit as a basis for the taxation of corporate income. This paper argues that this problem would, if anything, increase with dependence upon IFRSs, which serve entirely different purposes. IFRSs contain many subjective elements within their concepts of income and expenses, to provide the certainty that tax reporting requires. We draw instead upon the thinking underpinning the European Union’s (EU’s) Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), to suggest that tax-specific measures of income and expenses for taxation purposes need to be defined. Such a transactional approach provides a potential basis for developing <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> and determining a taxation base that could then be apportioned to each jurisdiction. However, in the practical political context the EU needs {{to be sensitive to the}} interests of member states, which have an interest in adopting particular ways of dealing with deductibility of interest, royalty payments and allowances for capital expenditure. In order to secure political momentum for change, we suggest that for the time being such contentious matters be deferred by allowing relief on these items to be granted at a national level after apportionment of other income between participating states in a regional unitary tax system. The paper then makes some suggestions for the development of a conceptual framework for taxation accounting standards that could be used to address these issues...|$|E

The effect of the income tax burden on property is more pronounced for states mandating <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> or the throwback rule.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Dissertation is to analyze the current ills of the {{international}} tax system with a special focus on developing countries, and to structure and present a <b>Unitary</b> <b>Taxation</b> System (“UT”) {{as a solution to}} the legitimate and multifaceted complaints about current international taxation of multinational companies (“MNEs”).

40|$|The {{taxation}} {{of multinational}} banks currently {{is governed by}} the general principles of international tax. However, it is arguable that there are characteristics exclusive to multinational banks that may warrant the consideration of a separate taxing regime. This article argues {{that because of the}} unique nature of multinational banks, the traditional international tax rules governing jurisdiction to tax and allocation of income do not produce a result which is optimal, as it does not reflect economic reality. That is, the current system does not produce a result that accurately reflects the economic source of the income or the location of the economic activity. The suggested alternative is <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> using global formulary apportionment. Formulary apportionment is considered as an alternative that reflects economic reality by recognising the unique nature of multinational banks and allocating the income to the location of the economic activity. The unique nature of multinational banking is recognised in the fact that formulary apportionment does not attempt to undertake a transactional division of a highly integrated multinational entity. Rather, it allocates income to the jurisdictions based on an economically justifiable formula. Starting from this recognition, {{the purpose of this article}} is to demonstrate that formulary apportionment is a theoretically superior (or optimal) model for the taxation of multinational banks. An optimal regime, for the purposes of this article, is considered to be one that distributes the taxing rights in an equitable manner between the relevant jurisdictions, while, simultaneously allowing decisions of the international banks to be tax neutral. In this sense, neutrality is viewed as an economic concept and equity is regarded as a legal concept. A neutral tax system is one in which tax rules do not affect economic choices about commercial activities. Neutrality will ideally be across jurisdictions as well as across traditional and non-traditional industries. The primary focus of this article is jurisdictional neutrality. A system that distributes taxing rights in an equitable manner between the relevant jurisdictions ensures that each country receives its fair share of tax revenue. Given the increase in multinational banking, jurisdictions should be concerned that they are receiving their fair share. Inter-nation equity is concerned with re-determining the proper division of the tax base among countries. Richard and Peggy Musgrave argue that sharing of the tax base by countries of source should be seen as a matter of inter-nation equity requiring international cooperation. The rights of the jurisdiction of residency will also be at issue. To this extent, while it is agreed that inter-nation equity is an essential attribute to an international tax regime, there is no universal agreement as to how to achieve it. The current system attempts to achieve such equity through a combined residency and source regime, with the transfer pricing rules used to apportion income between the relevant jurisdictions. However, this article suggests, that as an alternative to the current regime, equity would be achieved through formulary apportionment. Opposition to formulary apportionment is generally based on the argument that it is not a theoretically superior (or optimal) model because of the implementation difficulties. Yet these are two separate issues. As such, this article is divided into two core parts. The first part examines the theoretical soundness of the formulary apportionment model concluding that it is theoretically superior to the arm’s length pricing requirement of the traditional transfer pricing regime. The second part examines the practical implications of accepting formulary apportionment as an optimal model with a view to disclosing the issues that arise when a formulary apportionment regime is adopted. Prior to an analysis of the theoretical and practical application of formulary apportionment to multinational banks, the unique nature of these banks is considered. The article concludes that, while there are significant implementation, compliance, and enforcement issues to overcome, the <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> model may be theoretically superior to the current arm’s length model which applies to multinational banks. This conclusion is based on the <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> model providing greater alignment with the unique features of these banks...|$|E
40|$|Estimating the Misalignment {{between the}} Locations of Profits and Economic Activities of EU's Banks Author: Eliška Jelínková Supervisor: Petr Janský Ph. D. In this thesis {{we focus on}} the {{misalignment}} of European multinational banks' profits and the role of tax havens in banks' taxation. We use the existing literature and our newly collected data to estimate the difference between the location of banks' declared profit and the real economic activity in a given country. We estimate the impact of <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> using an apportionment formula on banks' redistributed tax base as well as on overall tax base in a given country. We find that banks report their profits disproportionally to their economic activities in given countries. If profit were apportioned across countries on the basis of employees and turnover, approximately 60 % of the profits would be redistributed on average each year. Then we focus on where the main part of a banks' profit goes and compare the results with an existing list of tax havens. We conclude that the low-tax countries {{play a significant role in}} profit redistribution of banks and that the related risk of base erosion and profit shifting is higher for large banks...|$|E

What happens when U. S. state economic regulations conflict with international norms. What capabilities do states possess to defend their regulations when bargaining in the international arena.

Growing global economic interdepence is not eliminating California's regulatory options, since the U.

S. state governments can bargain directly with foreign governments and multinational enterprises as actors in the international arena. As the international arena increasingly intrudes on the affairs of subfederal governments, the U.

40|$|Thesis (MCom (South African and International Taxation)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Multinational {{enterprises}} {{have been}} widely accused of using aggressive tax planning schemes to avoid paying tax all over the world. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyse the methods used by multinational enterprises in the context of business restructurings to shift profits from high to low tax jurisdictions. Transactions between associated entities have generally been manipulated by applying non-arm’s length prices to these transactions, as well as devising agreements where the economic substance varies from the form of the transaction. The study aims to investigate some of the practical challenges faced by tax administrators in the application of the arm’s length principle. The study was conducted based on a literature review, as well as analysing specific examples reported in newspapers where multinational enterprises have used aggressive tax planning schemes to shift profits. International case law was also analysed to evaluate some of the factors considered by the courts in the determination of the arm’s length price. It was found that multinational enterprises definitely use aggressive tax planning schemes to shift profits. The practical challenges in the determination of arm’s length prices, complexity of the transactions involved, as well as a lack of resources, especially in the developing nations, are some of the factors that cause tax administrators to battle to find a solution to deter and detect these schemes. Other methods such as the <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> method and the country by country reporting concept have been brought forward as alternatives to the arm’s length principle. These alternatives have been proposed in an effort to find a solution to the challenges posed by the arm’s length principle. Specific measures have also been recommended for developing nations’ tax administrators to resolve the issues that they currently experience in this context. Master...|$|E
40|$|In the {{six years}} since the then Chief of Staff of the JCT {{pronounced}} transfer pricing enforcement to be dead, numerous case studies have demonstrated the truth of his observation, starting with the JCTs own examination of six US based multinationals (MNEs) in 2010 and followed by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearings on Microsoft, HP and Apple in 2012 - 13. There {{is little doubt that}} the current transfer pricing rules, in conjunction with the dysfunctional Subpart F rules, allow US-based MNEs to shift most of their profits to low tax jurisdictions. It is estimated that there are currently about 2 trillion dollars of such profits that benefit from deferral and cannot be repatriated because they are not subject to foreign tax and therefore would be subject to full US taxation upon repatriation under current law. Hence the push to adopt territoriality and allow the MNEs to distribute these trapped profits as dividends to their US parent, which can then in turn use them to pay dividends to its shareholders. The OECD has recently come to recognize that the transfer pricing system does not work as intended. In its report on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, the OECD recognizes that BEPS results in revenue losses that affect all states, especially poorer ones; that systematic tax avoidance by the richest and most powerful companies in the world undermines the general legitimacy of taxation; that it gives MNEs significant competitive advantages over purely domestic firms, resulting in inefficient allocations of investment and major distortions to economic activity; and that it skews the decisions of the MNEs themselves, resulting in overall economic welfare losses. This article will contrast three approaches to dealing with the BEPS problem: adopting a <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> regime; ending deferral; and adopting anti base erosion measures. It concludes that while the first approach is the best long term option, the other two are more promising as immediate candidates for adoption in the context of US tax reform and the OECD BEPS project...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} {{one type of}} {{multinational}} entity – the multinational bank – poses particularly significant challenges to the international tax regime {{in terms of its}} current profit allocation rules. Multinational banks are a unique subset of multinational entities, and as a consequence of their unique traits, the traditional international tax regime foes not yield an optimal interjurisdictional allocation of taxing rights. The opportunity for tax minimisation, achievable because of the unique traits, and realised through exploitation of the traditional source and transfer pricing regime, results in a jurisdictional distribution of taxing rights which does not reflect economic reality. There are two distinct ways in which the traditional international tax regime fails to reflect economic activity. The first way that economic activity may not be reflected in the distribution of the taxing rights to income from multinational banking is through the application of traditional source rules. The traditional sources rules allocate income where transactions are completed rather than where the intermediation services are arranged. As a result of their unique commercial role as financial intermediaries, by separating intermediary economic activity from legal transactions with third parties, multinational banks may distort the true location of the activity giving rise to income. The second way in which the traditional tax regime may fail to reflect economic activity is through the traditional transfer pricing regime requiring related or internal transaction to be undertaken at an arm’s length price. The arm’s length pricing requirement is theoretically deficient in its failure to recognise the highly integrated nature of multinational banking. In practice, the arm’s length pricing requirement is also difficult, if not impossible, to apply to multinational banks because of the requirement of comparability. The difficulties associated with the current model have resulted in a subtle move by multinational banks towards global formulary apportionment. This thesis concludes that, for the international taxation of multinational banks, the current source regime should be replaced with a system that allocates profits for tax purposes on the basis of income source, with source determined using a <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> or global formulary apportionment system. It is argued that global formulary apportionment is a theoretically superior model that provides both jurisdiction to tax and allocated profits {{on the basis of the}} economic activity that generates the income...|$|E
40|$|Topic: The {{study is}} linked to the concept of a group of companies. A group {{is at the same time}} a legal and {{economical}} phenomenon. An international group of companies consists of companies and permanent establishments located in different states. The study covers not only subsidiaries to be consolidated to the group financial statement, but also associated enterprises where the group’s ownership can be below 50 % and which will not, therefore, be consolidated. Such associated enterprises which do not belong to the group under accounting and company laws can have a firm connection to the group. Regarding taxation, attention will be paid to the conditions and terms concluded inside the group. Adjustments can also become a factor in relation associated enterprises which are not consolidated if the conditions and terms concluded deviate from what would have been agreed on at the open market. The main goal of the thesis is to find out how international regulation created within the OECD and EU harmonises the taxation of interest payments between associated enterprises. The study consists of the levels of tax treaty law, European Community law and domestic tax law. From these three levels, the focus is on European Community law or in a wider context on the European Union. The main research methods are legal dogmatic and comparative law. The comparative part of the study focuses on the tax systems of the United States of America, Germany, Estonia and Finland. The macro level comparison covers not only domestic international laws, tax treaties, case law and other official documents, but also customary methods of interpretation, ways of transposing international agreements into the national legal order and carrying out international law obligations in the respective countries. These countries have been chosen from the Finnish point-of-view. The United States was a significant capital exporting country before the current economical recession. The U. S. tax treaty policy and domestic international tax laws have had a great impact on other countries’ tax systems. Economically, Germany is the most powerful country in the EU. Relatively speaking, most of the preliminary references referred to the European Court of Justice dealing with direct income tax law are made by German courts. Estonia is interesting from the Finnish perspective due to geographical reasons and tax competition. The study also covers the Swedish tax system quite deeply. Sweden was not included in the macro level comparison because group taxation systems are similar in Finland and Sweden. The two countries also joined the EU at the same time. Micro level comparison, which examines specific legal institutions, was carried out with Belgium, Denmark, France, India, Mexico and the Netherlands as examples. Structure The study has ten chapters. Chapter 1 describes the goals, methodology, limitations and sources of the thesis. Chapter 2 presents principles and goals which affect interpretation of tax law. The principles of legality and equality may be legally enforced, whereas ability to pay, neutrality and fairness are goals for the improvement of the society’s social feature. Chapter 2 first discusses the sources of international taxation from international law and treaties before and moving on to international tax law and its interpretation. European tax law is studied from a critical perspective. The impact of acquis communautaire on national tax systems has been compared to a jack-in-the-box which lowers the predictability of tax assessment. Chapter 3 deals with the history of direct tax harmonisation and the current possibilities to cross-border loss-relief. The European Commission’s initiatives for group taxation - Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base and Home State Taxation - are discussed. Thin capitalisation and transfer pricing problems would be eliminated if these initiatives were adopted. Companies taking part into <b>unitary</b> <b>taxation</b> would be fiscally consolidated at a group level. Corporate tax harmonisation could go further than this in theory. An EU tax would eliminate the current constitutional problems. The EU tax would create a direct tax link between the EU and its citizens. The EU’s political accountability would be improved if the European Parliament’s involvement in the adoption of tax laws was increased. Chapter 4 presents group financing from a taxation point-of-view. Debt financing may provide tax benefits in cross-border situations. Interest payments are usually deductible expenses, whereas dividend paid to a foreign parent company may usually not be deducted out of company profits. The differential tax treatment of debt and equity may imply tax-planning opportunities for group financing. Groups of companies may strive to allocate group financing companies into low-tax jurisdictions where the general tax rate is low, and extend intercompany loans into high-tax jurisdictions where the benefit of a tax deduction is high. Equity investments also provide tax-planning opportunities. The international tax treaty network and the Parent-Subsidiary Directive eliminate taxation at source from intra-group dividends as well. Chapter 5 examines the concept of an associated enterprise. The concept of an associated enterprise is defined differently in the OECD Model Tax Convention and the Interest and Royalties Directive. International accounting standards and domestic accounting and tax laws also define the concept using their own criteria. A company belonging to a group of companies may, in practice, be an associated company under accounting laws but fall outside the scope of the Interest and Royalties Directive. Chapters 6 - 9 deal with the concept of interest, taxation principles, interest deductions and transfer pricing issues dealing with interest and financing. Interest is commonly considered to be return on debt capital. The concept of interest has not been defined in the Finnish Income Tax Act or Business Income Tax Act. The Act on Taxation of Income of a Person Subject to Limited Tax Liability contains a definition of interest which is applied between associated companies located in different EU member states. Interest, according to the Act, means any income from debt-claims whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits. The legal concept of interest is generally equal to the economic concept of interest. Return on zero-coupon bonds and perpetual loans are considered to be interest. The amount of interest is determined by percentage of interest, time and debt. Debt is characterized by the debtor-creditor relationship and the absence of participation rights. Finnish tax law does not explicitly rule how to draw a line between debt and equity. The classification of hybrid instruments under civil law is generally a starting-point. The classification is also based on case law. The economic substance of an instrument can be considered. There are no published cases where hybrid equity would have been reclassified as debt for tax purposes. Debt has been reclassified as equity only in a few cases. According to the Commentary to the OECD Model Tax Convention, interest generally means remuneration on money lent, being remuneration coming within the category of “income form movable capital”. Article 11 OECD states that interest means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits and income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, in particular. There is an interconnection between interest and dividends in the Articles of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Interest on participating bonds should normally not be considered as a dividend; also, interest on convertible bonds should not be considered as a dividend before the bonds are actually converted as shares. It may be difficult to make a distinction between interest and dividend in situations of thin capitalisation. If the repayment of loan largely depends on the success of an enterprise, interest paid on such loans may be taxed as a dividend. The Contracting States may widen Article 11 OECD as to include any income which is taxed as interest under their domestic laws. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines require that the arm’s principle shall be followed in group financing. The arm’s length principle requires that associated enterprises shall apply market based interest rate and other financing terms to their internal debts and receivables. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines do not, however, indicate how an arm’s length interest rate should be determined. The comparable uncontrolled price method is usually the preferred method for determining an arm’s length interest rate. It can be challenging to find loan agreements which would be sufficiently close comparables as to type, quality and quantity with an intercompany loan. The cost plus method has also been suggested as a suitable method for evaluating a current interest rate. With regard to comparables, an internal uncontrolled comparable would be preferred. External comparables will nevertheless be used in many cases. Group interest rates can be compared with market interest rates or a simulated credit rating can be carried out. Chapter 10 concludes the thesis and discusses future scenarios on interest deductions in Finland. Finland does not have statutory thin capitalisation rules. The Finnish approach is liberal toward thin capitalisation. The tax authorities evaluate a company’s financing structure as a whole. Attention will be paid to the company’s debt to equity ratio and whether interest is paid in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Debt push-down structures have been widely used. Highly-leveraged financing structures have been subject to tax audits. It is fairly common to declare that debt to equity ratio 15 : 1 is accepted in Finland. This debt to equity ratio was accepted by the Supreme Administrative Court in KHO 1999 : 19. A clear rule should not be drawn only from one judgment. Published case-law of the Supreme Administrative Court dealing with thin capitalisation is limited. Many of the cases have been decided on the basis of a double taxation treaty. A qualified non-discrimination article following Article 24 (4) of OECD Model Tax Convention has prevented a denial of deductibility of interest. The EC Treaty Freedoms also require equal treatment of domestic and cross-border situations. Landmark cases dealing with thin capitalisation are cases C- 324 / 00 Lankhorst-Hohorst, C- 524 / 04 Thin Cap Group Litigation and C- 105 / 07 N. V. Lammers. The ECJ has found that the discriminatory application of thin capitalisation provisions involving a fixed debt to equity ratio constitutes a disproportionate restriction of the freedom of establishment. Domestic anti-abuse measures which categorically prevent taxpayers from exercising their right to free movement are not allowed unless domestic legislation has a “specific purpose of preventing wholly artificial arrangements”. Interest deductions in Finland de lege ferenda The Finnish Ministry of Finance published a study in April 2009 dealing with interest deductions in corporate income taxation. The study covers the current legal status in Finland, development in various European countries and the impact of European Community law and double taxation treaties on interest deductions. The aim is to discover whether deductibility of interest payments should be limited in Finland and, if so, what kind of measures should be taken. Organisations representing Finnish industry and Trade, the Tax Administration, the Finnish Bank and tax law professors were requested to answer whether limitations on interest deductions should be introduced in Finland and, if so, what the limitations should be. The deadline was in June 2009. Due to the economic recession, it is likely that restrictions on interest deductions, if they are considered necessary, will not be introduced in the near future. The Finnish corporate tax system should be reviewed as a whole before deciding whether limitations on interest deductions should be introduced. The liberal approach toward interest deductions and thin capitalisation provide companies with a competitive advantage. If the companies’ right to make interest deductions is limited, it should also be considered whether the general corporate tax rate of 26 % should be lowered. The future of the Finnish group contribution system, where a profit-making group company may transfer taxable profit to a loss-making group company, should be reviewed in the same context. The Ministry of Finance has already indicated that Finland may transfer to a fiscal consolidation system. Taking into account the current economic situation, there is a risk that tighter interest deduction rules may create unnecessary obstacles for corporate financing. On the other hand, the protection of the Finnish corporate tax base may call for limitations on interest deductions. Statutory interest deduction rules would provide legal certainty for both the taxpayer and the tax administration. The U. S. interest-stripping rules, the German Zinsschranke and Swedish limitations on related parties’ interest deductions serve as examples for possible limitations on interest deductions. In addition, the Belgian notional interest deduction and the Dutch initiatives on defiscalisation of interest income and deductions in group taxation and a mandatory interest-box should also be considered as well. Introducing a tax incentive would stimulate investments, whereas limitations on interest deductions would probably diminish Finland’s attractiveness from an investor point-of-view. Mitkä ovat kansainvälisten konsernien verosuunnittelumahdollisuudet sisäisissä siirroissa? Kansainvälisen konsernin verotuksen tasoon voidaan vaikuttaa valitsemalla sisäisiin siirtoihin lievästi verotettava tulotyyppi. Verosopimusten mukaiset korkotulon nollaverokannat voivat alentaa konsernin efektiivistä veroastetta. Verosuunnittelu voi johtaa tilanteeseen, jossa käytetyn tulotyypin muoto ei vastaa tulon taloudellista luonnetta. Sekamuotoisen hybridi-instrumentin tuotto saatetaan luonnehtia verotuksessa uudelleen koron sijasta osingoksi. Teoksessa perehdytään koron vähennysoikeuteen elinkeinoverotuksessa. Verosopimusoikeus ja eurooppaoikeus edellyttävät, että rajat ylittävien korkojen on pääsääntöisesti oltava samoin edellytyksin vähennyskelpoisia kuin kotimaisten korkojen. Kirjassa käsitellään myös rajanvetoa koron ja luovutusvoiton, liiketulon, muun tulon sekä rojaltin tulotyyppien välillä. Lähiyhtiön käsitettä tarkastellaan moniulotteisesti vero-oikeuden, kirjanpidon ja yhtiöoikeuden näkökulmasta. Viime vuosina useat valtiot ovat siirtyneet alikapitalisointisäännöksistä korkovähennysrajoituksiin. Kirja ottaa kantaa koron vähennysoikeuden rajoittamiseen Suomen elinkeinoverotuksessa. Etujärjestöt ja julkishallinto ovat antaneet valtiovarainministeriölle lausuntoja, joissa on sekä vastustettu että puollettu koron vähennysoikeuden rajoittamista. Lisäksi tarkastellaan markkinaehtoisen koron määrittämistä siirtohinnoittelussa. Denna avhandling gäller beskattning av interna räntebetalningar mellan närstående bolag belägna i olika stater. Avhandlingen är en rättsdogmatisk studie med komparativt inslag från USA, Tyskland, Estland och Finland. Även Sverige har behandlats relativt ingående. Andra länder har behandlats i anslutning till särskilda rättsfrågor. Rättsfall från cirka 10 länder har behandlats. Avhandlingen redogör för skillnaden mellan hard law och soft law. Flera metoder, såsom skattepolitik och planering, har tillämpats vid sidan av den rättsdogmatiska och komparativa metoden. Avhandlingen har lånat inslag från andra vetenskapsområden, som t. ex. bokföringen, IFRS, bolagsrätten, finansieringen, nationalekonomin och historia forskningen. Se Kristiina Äimä: Sisäiset korot lähiyhtiöiden kansainvälisessä verotuksessa. WSOY. Helsingfors 2009. Avhandlingen innehåller en engelsk resumé om 17 sidor. Temat behandlas ur ett internationellt skatterättsligt perspektiv. Begreppet närstående bolag är centralt för temat. Närstående bolag definieras på ett annorlunda sätt inom bokföring, bolagsrätt och skatterätt. Likaså är definitionerna av ränta olika i skatterätten och andra vetenskaper. Räntebegreppet undersöks ur skatteavtalsrättens, EG-skatterättens och nationella rättens perspektiv. Särskild vikt läggs vid avdragsrätten för räntebetalningar och fastställandet av en marknadsmässig ränta. Inom multinationella företagsgrupper förekommer det lån och förskott på betalningar på samma sätt som mellan oberoende bolag. Ett skuldförhållande kan utgöras av en kortfristig skuld, såsom kundfordring eller leverantörsskuld. Därtill kan kapital lånas ut långfristigt i kapitalplaceringssyfte. Likaså kan kapital lånas ut för att ställa arbetande kapital till ett närstående bolags förfogande. Beviljandet av ett närståendelån kan vara i strid med aktieägarnas likställighetsprincip. Detta har beaktats i bolagsrätten. I verksamhetsberättelsen till bokslutet skall separat uppges penninglån, säkerheter och ansvarsförbindelser till personer som står bolaget nära samt de huvudsakliga villkoren för dessa. Avhandlingen tangerar finansieringen av multinationella företagsgrupper ur beskattningens synvinkel. Det påstås allmänt att företagsfinansieringen påverkas av det faktum att investeringar som har finansierats med främmande kapital beskattas i de flesta stater lindigare än kapitalplaceringar. Enligt huvudregeln får en investerare göra avdrag för räntebetalningar medan utdelningar på kapitalplaceringar vanligtvis inte är avdragsgilla i beskattningen. De belgiska reglerna gällande fiktivt ränteavdrag på eget kapital avviker däremot från huvudregeln. OECD-medlemsländernas dubbelskattningsavtal och nationella lagstiftning befriar vanligtvis ränteinkomster från beskattning i betalarens källstat. Källskattefriheten leder till skatteeffektiva kapitalöverföringar inom multinationella företagsgrupper. Internationell skatteplanering drar nytta även av ränteavdragen. Skatteeffektiviteten kan vara icke önskvärd från en statsfiskal synpunkt. Inom EU finns det ytterligare reglering gällande interna räntebetalningar. Enligt EG:s ränte- och royaltydirektiv beskattas interna räntebetalningarna endast i mottagarens hemviststat. För övrigt har EG-domstolen tolkat EU:s grundfriheter i sin rättspraxis så att en medlemsstat skall bevilja avdragsrätten under samma förutsättningar i gränsöverskridande situationer som i inhemska situationer. En nationell bestämmelse som inskränker etableringsfriheten kan ändå vara motiverad när den särskilt avser fiktiva upplägg som iscensätts för att kringgå lagstiftningen. Kravet på lika skattebehandling har lett till att många medlemsstater har övergått från traditionell underkapitaliseringsreglering till ränteavdragsbegränsningar. De nya avdragsbegränsningarna kan vara bundna till en procentenhet av EBIT (eng. Earnings before Interest and Taxes) eller motsvarande siffra eller låntagarens nominella finansiering av affärsförmögenhet. Ett koncernbolag som hör till en europeisk företagsgrupp beskattas som om bolaget vore fristående. Detta förorsakar mångfaldig beskattning. Europeiska kommissionens initiativ att harmonisera koncernbeskattningen skulle eliminera förlustutjämnings-, underkapitaliserings- och interprissättningsproblemen inom europeiska företagsgrupper. Den senaste utvecklingen i Sverige har följts noggrant i Finland. Bland annat förekomsten av räntesnurror i företagsskatteplaneringen och Regeringsrättens dom i Industrivärlden-målet har diskuterats. Dessutom har de nya svenska ränteavdragsbegränsningarna som skall förhindra skatteplanering inom företagsgrupper väckt intresse. För tillfället utreder finansministeriet om avdragsrätten för räntebetalningar borde begränsas inom finsk näringsbeskattning. Ifall avdragsrätten begränsas används sannolikt de svenska begränsningarna som förebild för den finska nya regleringen. Avhandlingen behandlar fördelar och nackdelar som kunde uppkomma om begränsningar introducerades...|$|E
