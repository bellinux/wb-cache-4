50|$|Less {{than three}} days after the disaster, a {{contract}} was signed for the ship to be raised. However, those efforts were unsuccessful. The earliest attempts at raising Vasa by English engineer Ian Bulmer, resulted in righting the ship but also got it more securely stuck in the mud and was most likely one of the biggest impediments to the earliest attempts at recovery. Salvaging technology in the early 17th century was much more primitive than today, but the recovery of ships used roughly the same principles as were used to raise Vasa more than 300 years later. Two ships or hulks were placed parallel to either side above the wreck, and ropes attached to several anchors were sent down and hooked to the ship. The two hulks were filled with as much water as was safe, the ropes tightened, and the water pumped out. The sunken ship then rose with the ships on the surface and could be towed to shallower waters. The process was then repeated until the entire ship was successfully raised above water level. Even if the <b>underwater</b> <b>weight</b> of Vasa was not great, the mud in which it had settled made it sit more secure on the bottom and required considerable lifting power to overcome. More than 30 years after the ship's sinking, in 1663-1665, Albreckt von Treileben and Andreas Peckell mounted an effort to recover the valuable guns. With a simple diving bell, the team of Swedish and Finnish divers retrieved more than 50 of them.|$|E

40|$|Penguins are {{outstanding}} divers. Particularly intriguing is {{the observation}} {{that they seem to}} dive on inspiration, which contributes to increasing oxygen stores but which increases their buoyancy. It has been concluded that buoyancy is a major factor in determining the energetics of shallow diving birds and there is a positive correlation between estimated air volume in the body (respiratory system and feathers) and the maximum depth in the dive of free-ranging penguins. However, it is not known whether the variation in the total air volume is caused by the variation in the air volume in the respiratory system or in plumage. In the present study, <b>underwater</b> <b>weights</b> of restrained Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae (n= 27 birds) were continuously measured in a experimental tank. The birds lost much air from their feathers within 1 - 2 min of submergence. The maximum weights in the water were used to calculate the minimum air volumes that diving birds are expected to have in their body. These volumes were compared with estimated air volumes from two free-ranging Adelie penguins. Most estimated values of the free-ranging birds were larger than values from the restrained birds, which indicates that variation in the former air volume is likely caused by the variation in the air in the respiratory system. Penguins seem to adjust the volume of air inhaled to the maximum depths of their dives...|$|R

In the present study, the potential of utilizing high throughput commercially available NIR interactance systems for dry matter determination in whole unpeeled potato tubers is investigated. The performance of a 2 D NIR interactance instrument was compared with that of a 1 D NIR interactance instrument and a traditional <b>underwater</b> <b>weight</b> apparatus. A total of 114 tubers were assessed individually with both of the NIR instruments (760 - 1040 nm), the <b>underwater</b> <b>weight</b> and an external reference method (freeze drying).

The {{purposes of this study}} were (1) to evaluate the validity of %body fat using 5 kinds of indirect method- 4 brands of bioelectrical impedance (BI) analyzers and skinfold thickness-against body fat data derived by <b>underwater</b> <b>weighting,</b> and (2) to discuss the accuracy of each method. The subjects were 40 men and 61 women, aged 20 to 67 years (men : 31. 0 ± 11. 0 yr, women : 36. 0 ± 13. 0 yr). The BI analyzers used for this study were the Sekisui SS- 103, Omron HBF- 300, Ueda TYPE-PS, and Tanita TBF- 534, and an Eiken caliper was used for skinfold thickness detrmination. Percentage of body fat etimated by each method was significantly correlated (r= 0. 55 - 0. 77) with the data from underwater weighing in both sexes, and the standard error of estimate (SEE) for %body fat was about 3 % for men. However, %fat estimated by the HBF- 300 and skinfold thickness for women were significantly different from the results of underwater weighing, giving a SEE of 4 % or over for all methods. The accuracy of %fat estimated by the TBF- 534 was slightly worse than that for the other BI analyzers in both sexes. In women, the accuracy of %fat estimated by skinfold thickness was slightly worse than that by the BI methods. From these results, it is concluded that %fat can be estimated by each method without a large discrepancy. However, the validity of each method for estimating %fat may not be as high as other reference methods. Further research is necessary for improvement of prediction accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Properties {{of fresh}} potatoes, {{including}} dry matter (DM) content, starch content, and near-infrared (NIR) spectra, were determined {{and related to}} the sensory-perceived texture of the steam-cooked samples. To quantify these relationships, three potato cultivars, respectively representing a firm cooking potato (cv. Nicola), a mealy cooking potato (cv. Irene), and a cultivar (cv. Bintje) with intermediate cooking properties, were classified {{on the basis of}} three size categories. For each size category and cultivar a DM distribution was determined {{on the basis of the}} <b>underwater</b> <b>weight</b> of the individual potatoes. Each DM distribution was divided into three subcategories based on low, medium, and high DM contents. This categorization was performed for freshly harvested potatoes and for potatoes stored for 3 and 6 months, respectively. In total, this resulted in 27 DM distributions, of which 16 were non-normally distributed, and 81 samples. Linear relationships were established between the DM content, as determined by either <b>underwater</b> <b>weight</b> analysis or oven-drying, and the starch content. On the basis of partial least-squares regression (PLSR), statistical models were developed relating sensory-based texture descriptors with the DM matter content of the samples. It was also shown, by applying PLSR, that the NIR spectra, originating from the potato samples, could be related to the DM content and to the sensory-perceived texture. From the relationships between DM content and sensory-perceived texture, on the one hand, and from the DM content and NIR spectra, on the other, it was concluded that the DM content rather than the cultivar determines the sensory-perceived texture of steam-cooked potatoes. Cultivar-specific elements may also contribute to the perceived texture but are overruled by the DM content. Storage did not affect the mutual relationships between the DM content, the sensory properties, and the NIR spectra...|$|E

The disadvantage of using deadweight anchors in conditions where a mushroom anchor could be used is that it needs to be around ten times the weight of the equivalent mushroom anchor.|$|R

Monthly year-round census showed a consistent unimodal size-frequency distribution, with mean arm radius for the population fluctuating from 93. 8 to 99. 4 mm, at Asan reef flat, Guam, Mariana Islands. This census failed to detect a significant influx of smaller individuals within the population. Searching efforts for this and other asteroids yielded only three pretransformation-stage juveniles and less than 10 transforming young (with arm radius of approximately 50 mm) during a 3 -year period (1972 through 1974), {{in spite of the}} omnipresence of adults.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, {{a significant}} {{fraction of the}} light shining {{on the surface of}} the water is lost by reflection and, thus, will not be available to attract fish and members of their food chain. Security lights can be modified to operate submerged in water. Positioning the bulb underwater delivers approximately twice as much light to attract fish. However, the modification must be done professionally as the high voltages that power these lamps can be lethal. Commercially made, submersible fishing lights are available on the internet. The power ballast and lamp housing is mounted on a pole in a dry location. The lamp, potted in a waterproof housing, is connected to the ballast via a waterproof cable. Floating like a fishing line bob, the lamp is positioned <b>underwater</b> by <b>weights</b> on its submerged power supply cord. The bulb is fragile so some manufacturers offer protective covers and hard lenses. However, one unique feature of the submerged, unprotected bulb is that its outer glass envelope gets hot enough to prevent establishment of marine growth. When the bulb has a protective cover or is not operated daily occasional cleaning is required. A permanently fixed fishing light attractor is most effective if it is operated every night. It takes to a week or two for larger fish to discover the increasing concentration of bait fish attracted to the light. Once discovered, the fish return regularly — often arriving at predictable times of the evening.|$|R

In laboratory experiments, swimming activity of two-spotted gobies (Gobiusculus flavescens) was highest during daytime, with a peak at dawn. In contrast, sand gobies (Pomatoschistus minutus) were most active during the night. Due to a lower specific density of the body tissues and a smaller volume of the swimbladder, <b>underwater</b> <b>weight</b> of P. minutus was {{twice as high as}} that of G. flavescens. Nevertheless, no significant difference in energy demand could be found between the species. In both species, swimming fish consumed twice as much oxygen as those resting on the ground.

The whole system was controlled and operated by a programmable logic controller and process personal computer system. The system was able to process 12 potato samples per hour. Measurements were done to establish the sample carry-over in the system. The carry-over was proven to be well below the maximum acceptable level of 2 %. The UWW values established with the automatic system corresponded very well with the UWW data obtained by manual weighting. The day-to-day reproducibility of the UWW system was tested with golf balls. These balls have about the same specific gravity and size as potatoes. The day-to-day reproducibility coefficient of variation of the UWW unit was 0. 4 %. As a principle of proof, two tentative partial least squares calibration models, one for the starch concentration {{and one for the}} coagulating protein concentration in the potato samples, were calculated, applying leaving one out cross-validation. Both models were very promising. The by NIR-predicted starch concentrations showed to be at least as good or even better than the by UWW-obtained starch concentrations.

Control system of ROV is a bit complex because of the unknown non-linear hydrodynamics effects, parameters uncertainties and the lack of a precise model of the ROV dynamics and parameters. Conventional controller cannot dynamically compensate for unmodeled vehicle hydrodynamic forces or unknown disturbances. Underactuated condition is defined as one having less control inputs than degree of freedom, so how the ROV want to maintain a certain point or depth following mission when one or more of thrusters malfunction also an issue to be highlighted. Pose recovery or station keeping {{will be one of the}} issues in ROV design. This station keeping approach is used to maintain a position in relation to another moving ROV as the ROV tries to remain stationary at the desired depth with present the environmental disturbances such as wind, waves, current and unexpected environmental disturbances. Coupling issue between the tether and cable with ROV body will be one problem in stabilizing the ROV itself as it double the vehicle load. The <b>underwater</b> vehicle size, <b>weight</b> and operating depth, as well as the underwater vehicle motors, subsystems, and payload, all combine to determine the ROV's cable design. In underwater, the inability of wireless communication system fails to work very well to transmit the video stream even in short distance is another issue to be covered. This statement proved by Underwater Technology Research Group student's project. The experiment sets upthree types of sensor using wireless communication system for higher frequency such as video stream, data transfer and GPS...|$|R
