25|$|Formaldehyde is {{a common}} {{precursor}} to more complex compounds and materials. In approximate order of decreasing consumption, products generated from formaldehyde include <b>urea</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> resin, melamine resin, phenol formaldehyde resin, polyoxymethylene plastics, 1,4-butanediol, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate. The textile industry uses formaldehyde-based resins as finishers to make fabrics crease-resistant. Formaldehyde-based materials are key to the manufacture of automobiles, and used to make components for the transmission, electrical system, engine block, door panels, axles and brake shoes. The value of sales of formaldehyde and derivative products was over $145 billion in 2003, about 1.2% {{of the gross domestic}} product (GDP) of the United States and Canada. Including indirect employment, over 4 million people work in the formaldehyde industry across approximately 11,900 plants in the U.S. and Canada.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} mills in Bintulu that process wood-waste products. Two are Medium-density {{fibreboard}} (MDF) {{plants and the}} third is a charcoal briquette plant, with a total installed capacity of [...] per year. MDF plants utilise wood waste purchased from sawmills and plywood mills in the Bintulu area and occasionally from the Tanjung Manis timber processing zone located {{at the mouth of the}} Rajang River. Synthetic resins, which are required to hold wood dust together, constituted 20% of the total production cost of the wood panel products. MDF plants in Bintulu are operated by Daiken Sarawak Sdn Bhd, which was founded on 15 February 1994. The briquette plant is operated by Cipta Briquette Sdn Bhd. A glue/adhesive factory in Bintulu is owned by Bintulu Adhesive & Chemicals Sdn Bhd. It produces <b>urea</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> resin and phenol formaldehyde resin for plywood and chipboard manufacturing at Kemena Industrial Estate.

2500|$|The {{adhesives}} used in plywood {{have become}} a point of concern. Both <b>urea</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> and phenol formaldehyde are carcinogenic in very high concentrations. As a result, many manufacturers are turning to low formaldehyde-emitting glue systems, denoted by an [...] "E" [...] rating ("E0" [...] possessing the lowest formaldehyde emissions). Plywood produced to [...] "E0" [...] has effectively zero formaldehyde emissions.|$|E
50|$|Urea-formaldehyde {{insulation}} releases poisonous formaldehyde gas, causing {{indoor air}} quality problems. The chemical bond between the <b>urea</b> and <b>formaldehyde</b> is weak, resulting in degradation of the foam cells and emission of toxic formaldehyde gas into the home over time. Furthermore, some manufacturers used excess formaldehyde to ensure chemical bonding {{of all of the}} <b>urea.</b> Any leftover <b>formaldehyde</b> would escape after the mixing. Most states outlawed it in the early 1980s after dangers to building occupants were discovered. However emissions are highest when the urea-formaldehyde is new and decrease over time, so houses that have had urea-formaldehyde within their walls for years or decades do not require remediation.|$|R

30|$|A {{practical}} {{approach to}} enhancing the fire retardancy of wood-based materials by adding fire-retardant chemicals to the glue was developed. Plywoods were manufactured using <b>urea</b> melamine <b>formaldehyde</b> resin mixed with ammonium pentaborate or dihydrogen phosphate. Treated plywoods had better incombustibility than untreated ones. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis clearly demonstrated {{the distribution of}} boron and phosphorus, which had migrated from the glue to the wood, contributing to better fire retardant properties. The cross-sectional micrographs from scanning electron microscopy showed that untreated specimens exhibited a foamy structure near the interface in the glue layer and the deformed structure of wood cells. The cell structure and cell wall thickness retained intact in the specimens treated with <b>urea</b> melamine <b>formaldehyde</b> resin mixed with ammonium pentaborate or dihydrogen phosphate. When observing {{the effect of the}} thickness of overlay veneers on incombustibility, a shorter glowing time was obtained from the specimens with a thicker surface layer when the fire retardant chemical was added at 2 %, but the differences were smaller at the higher chemical retention of 4 %. A similar tendency was observed for the char length.|$|R
