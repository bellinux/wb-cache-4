25|$|Many experts, such as Jerry Fodor, {{write that}} the purpose of {{perception}} is knowledge, but evolutionary psychologists hold that its primary purpose is to guide action.

Evolutionary psychologists say that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.|$|E

25|$|In 464, Remismund, an {{ambassador}} who had travelled between Galicia and Gaul on several occasions, became King. Remismund {{was able to}} unite the factions of Suevi under his rule, {{and at the same}} time restore peace. He was also recognized, perhaps even approved of, by Theodoric, who sent him gifts and weapons along with a wife. Under the leadership of Remismund, the Suevi would again raid the nearby countries, plundering the lands of Lusitania and the Conventus Asturicense, whilst still fighting Galician tribes like the Aunonenses, who refused to submit to Remismund. In 468 they managed to destroy part of the walls of Conimbriga, in Lusitania, which was sacked and then mostly abandoned after the inhabitants fled or were taken back to the north as slaves. Next year they even managed to capture Lisbon, which was surrendered by its leader, Lusidio. He later became ambassador of the Suevi to the Emperor. The end of the chronicle of Hydatius in 468 doesn't let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> the later fate of Remismund.|$|E

Sadly, she doesn't always bring that same sense of humor and self-awareness to the joke of pop-star introspection. The album's raft of ripe-lotus ballads is larded with Alanis-ian poesy she can't pull off". Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ and stated that [...] "Katy's superpower, now more than ever, is minting songs so relatable that their insights quickly scale up to inspirational..... Now she grasps that she's making the mainstream, not just swimming in it".|$|E

[...] James Dinh of MTV noted that the song [...] "features an uplifting country/pop melody and a big chorus" [...] and it talks about [...] "the wonders of being in a happy relationship after surviving a rocky past." [...] Priya Elan of The Guardian believed that [...] "Mine" [...] depicts [...] "a stop-start relationship between a normal guy and girl".

Deep Roy was a noted stunt man who had notably played Droopy McCool of the Max Rebo Band in Return of the Jedi. Deep Roy, however, is not an amputee and so a cart with a false bottom was created. Anytime there was a scene where the beggar had to move, blue screen technology was used to add the background in during post-production. The cart featured a distinct [...] "squeak" [...] that Paul Rabwin described as [...] "creepy". He noted, [...] "There was a squeak that had to let <b>us</b> <b>know</b> that it was him.

[...] Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly felt the video was [...] "very fitting" [...] for the song's vibe, and felt it presented [...] "a distinct level of Mimi fabulosity." [...] A reporter from the Daily Mail called the visuals [...] "sizzling", and complimented the singers moments on the golden stage as [...] "glittering" [...] and [...] "fabulous". The Hollywood Reporters David Lipshutz described the video as a [...] "glitzy clip". Additionally, he outed its final segment of [...] "Carey singing while confetti rain down" [...] as the video's highlight.
