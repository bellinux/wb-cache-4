5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, several {{measurements}} of the concentration of manganese in Roaring Brook at Scranton ranged from 0.7 to 21 milligrams per liter and {{measurements of}} the calcium concentration ranged from 0.8 to 31.2 milligrams per liter. The concentration of sodium ranged from 6 to 20 milligrams per liter in two measurements and the potassium concentration ranged from 1 to 3.5 milligrams per liter. Two {{measurements of the}} concentration of recoverable chromium ranged from less than 20 to 30 micrograms per liter. The concentration of recoverable copper (in <b>unfiltered</b> water only) ranged from 30 to 200 micrograms per liter. The concentration of recoverable iron (in <b>unfiltered</b> water only) ranged from 0 to 444,000 micrograms per liter. The concentration of recoverable lead in the stream's <b>unfiltered</b> waters was found twice to be 50 micrograms per liter. The concentration of recoverable manganese in the stream's <b>unfiltered</b> waters ranged from 20 to 1600 micrograms per liter. The concentration of recoverable zinc in the stream's <b>unfiltered</b> waters ranged from 160 to 380 micrograms per liter. Trace amounts of nickel and silver {{have been found in}} the stream. The concentration of recoverable zinc in the stream's <b>unfiltered</b> waters ranged between 100 and 70,000 micrograms per liter. The concentration of recoverable mercury in the stream (with <b>unfiltered</b> water) was once found to be less than 0.5 micrograms per liter.|$|E
5|$|Herschel wedges, {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is {{destined for the}} eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface {{of a piece of}} glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected. The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. <b>Unfiltered</b> binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an <b>unfiltered</b> telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of fluoride in Roaring Brook at Scranton was once measured to be 0.2 milligrams per liter (in <b>unfiltered</b> water only). The chloride concentration ranged from 2 to 214 milligrams per liter during several measurements in the 20th century. The sulfate concentration ranged from 8 to 4700 milligrams per liter. During two measurements, the silica concentration ranged from 5.20 to 8.30 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded in darkness. The player character can fire daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of <b>unfiltered</b> textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Most beers are {{cleared of}} yeast by {{filtering}} when packaged in bottles and cans. However, bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being <b>unfiltered,</b> or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually {{recommended that the}} beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment {{at the bottom of}} the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.|$|E
5|$|The brewing giant Bass {{acquired}} William Stones in the 1960s, {{and began}} to heavily promote the keg variant of Stones Bitter, which eventually became the highest selling bitter in the country. However the keg version was promoted {{at the expense of}} the traditional unpasteurised and <b>unfiltered</b> cask conditioned version. In the 1990s, the ABV of Stones was gradually reduced, and, as ale sales declined, Stones reverted from a national into a regional brand. Following the closure of the Cannon Brewery, Stones has been brewed at a number of different breweries. When Bass exited its brewing business, Stones became a Coors brand (later Molson Coors).|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers was {{developed}} by Sorath, a Melbourne-based independent video game developer. The development group was formed by Matt Bush, a member of Dustforce creators Hitbox Team. The game's art direction and rendering engine were designed to reimagine the aesthetics and graphical style of video games from the 1990s. This was achieved by making use of <b>unfiltered</b> textures, jagged 3D models, and the deliberate implementation of polygon jitter and texture warping found in early 3D games. Jitter and warping were often considered technical flaws of PlayStation games; however, the recreation of these effects in Devil Daggers is to make enemies shudder and ripple during movement. Enemy designs are hellish, with some entities taking the form of insectoids with skeletal features. Audio is composed largely of distorted and abstract sounds with compressed, digitised screams used to produce unsettling noises for the creatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of dissolved oxygen in Darby Creek was measured {{to range from}} 7.4 to 12.4 milligrams per liter. The carbon dioxide concentration ranged from 1.9 to 3.4 milligrams per liter and the nitrogen concentration range from 2.1 to 2.2 milligrams per liter. The {{concentration of}} organic nitrogen ranged between < 0.19 and 0.25 milligrams per liter and the concentration of organic carbon ranged from 2.1 t to 2.2 milligrams per liter. The concentration of ammonia in filtered water was {{less than or equal}} to 0.02 milligrams per liter in two measurements and the nitrate concentration was half that in two measurements. The orthophosphate concentration in filtered water ranged from < 0.031 to 0.071 milligrams per liter and the phosphorus concentration in <b>unfiltered</b> water ranged from 0.032 to 0.045 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{effects were}} {{supervised}} by Tim Webber at the London-based VFX company Framestore, which {{was responsible for}} creating most of the film's visual effectsexcept for 17 shots. Framestore was also heavily involved in the art direction and, along with The Third Floor, the previsualization. Tim Webber stated that 80 percent of the movie consisted of CGcompared to James Cameron's Avatar (2009), which was 60 percent CG. To simulate the authenticity and reflection of <b>unfiltered</b> light in space, a manually controlled lighting system consisting of 1.8 million individually controlled LED lights was built. The 3D imagery was designed and supervised by Chris Parks. The majority of the 3D was created by stereo rendering the CG at Framestore. The remaining footage was converted into 3D in post-productionprincipally at Prime Focus, London, with additional conversion work by Framestore. Prime Focus's supervisor was Richard Baker.|$|E
5|$|Bill Pugh, {{the chief}} {{plastics}} designer at Cascelloid, based in Leicester, and former Royal Air Force pilot, created {{a prototype of}} the blown lemon-shaped plastic shaped container based upon Hack's idea sometime in the 1950s, {{as well as other}} types of blown containers. Pugh's experimented with the initial design until he was satisfied with its appearance. This plastic lemon product was then used for Hax lemon juice. Edward Hack, Ltd. produced and marketed Hax brand squeezable plastic lemon containers filled with two ounces of Sicilian lemon juice. Per Edward Hack, Ltd., the juice was <b>unfiltered,</b> had no water added to it, and contained a preservative to prevent spoilage. Retailers could purchase the product in packs of six bags that contained 12 squeeze packs each, totalling 72 units. Upon introduction to the marketplace, Hax juice and the plastic lemon design received some press coverage. The Hax logo used on Hax lemon juice dates back to at least 1935, at which time it was used in advertisements for Hax brand iodine pencils and Hax brand aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Bhimsen {{was able}} to {{continue}} making all the administrative decisions of the country, while the Regent Queen Tripurasundari would unquestioningly approve these decisions by stamping the royal seal issued {{in the name of}} King Rajendra on these government orders. The Regent never dared to express any doubts regarding Bhimsen's decisions. Nevertheless, {{to make sure that the}} King, his wives – Samrajya Laxmi Devi (senior) and Rajya Lakshmi Devi (junior) – and the Regent were insulated from influences of people other than Bhimsen and his closest relatives, Bhimsen had instated his youngest brother, General Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the royal palace to keep a watch on the royal family and to keep guard against any outside person. Any priest or courtier who wished to be granted an interview with the King, the Queens, or the Regent, had to get an approval from Ranbir Singh and the interview had to be conducted under his watchful presence. Similarly, the royal family were not allowed to leave the palace without Bhimsen's permission either. Bhimsen had also neglected the formal education of Rajendra, due to which he had grown to be uncritical and weak minded to the extent that he was even unaware that he was virtually a prisoner. However, his wives were more alert and wary of Bhimsen since, according to Baburam Acharya, they received <b>unfiltered</b> news of the world outside the royal palace from their handmaidens, who would leave the palace compounds and go to their homes during their menstruation and gather news and rumors of the day, which they would then relate to the Queens.|$|E
25|$|Some cleanrooms {{are kept}} at a {{positive}} pressure so if any leaks occur, air leaks {{out of the}} chamber instead of <b>unfiltered</b> air coming in.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, {{schools and}} public offices {{had to close}} in Tehran and 1600 people were taken to hospital, in a severe smog blamed largely on <b>unfiltered</b> car exhaust.|$|E
25|$|Not all beer in {{mainland}} Europe is pasteurised; {{there are plenty}} of examples of <b>unfiltered,</b> unpasteurised beers, but these will commonly be served from a chilled container under pressure: a keg.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to {{the intense}} {{radiation}} of direct, <b>unfiltered</b> sunlight {{would lead to}} local heating, though that would likely be well distributed by the body's conductivity and blood circulation. Other solar radiation, particularly ultraviolet rays, however, may cause severe sunburn.|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{pollution}} {{is a bigger}} concern in Kazakhstan's manufacturing cities, where aging factories pump huge quantities of <b>unfiltered</b> pollutants {{into the air and}} groundwater. The former capital, Almaty, is particularly threatened, {{in part because of the}} postindependence boom in private automobile ownership.|$|E
25|$|In all cases, if {{employer}} select respirator with tight-fitting facepiece (full face mask, elastomeric half-mask or quarter-mask, or {{filtering facepiece}} respirator), all employee must be fit tested (to prevent leakage <b>unfiltered</b> polluted air through gaps between {{their faces and}} the tight-fitting masks, which may not match to their faces). Appendix A provides {{a detailed description of}} this testing.|$|E
25|$|Cask ale or cask-{{conditioned}} beer is <b>unfiltered</b> and unpasteurised beer {{which is}} conditioned (including secondary fermentation) and served from a cask without additional nitrogen or carbon dioxide pressure. Cask ale is also {{sometimes referred to}} as real ale in the United Kingdom, a term coined by the Campaign for Real Ale, often now extended to cover bottle-conditioned beer as well.|$|E
25|$|A {{tap hole}} {{near the edge}} of the top, and a spile hole on the side used for {{conditioning}} the <b>unfiltered</b> and unpasteurised beer. A keg has a single opening in the centre of the top to which a flow pipe is attached. Kegs are artificially pressurised after fermentation with carbon dioxide or a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} {{research}} in Chernobyl and in the United States were similar: the filter material is well caught a fine aerosol, and created a small resistance {{to the passage of}} air through it; but a lot of <b>unfiltered</b> air passes through the gap between the mask and face. Research has shown that one can expect the minimum values of the protection factor 2÷8, or even 1.5.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unfiltered</b> bowl-shaped aquaria are {{now widely}} {{regarded}} as unsuitable for most fish. Advanced alternatives are now available. In order to keep water conditions at suitable levels, aquariums should contain at least two forms of filtration: biological and mechanical. Chemical filtration should also be considered under some circumstances for optimum water quality. Chemical filtration is frequently achieved via activated carbon, to filter medications, tannins, and/or other known impurities from the water.|$|E
25|$|Commercial kvass, {{especially}} {{less expensive}} varieties, is occasionally made {{like many other}} soft drinks, using sugar, carbonated water, malt extract, and flavourings. Better brands, often made by beer rather than soft drink manufacturers, usually use {{a variation of the}} traditional process to brew their products. Kvass is commonly served <b>unfiltered,</b> with the yeast still in it, which adds to its unique flavour as well as its high vitamin B content.|$|E
25|$|ACK {{scanning}} {{is one of}} {{the more}} unusual scan types, as it does not exactly determine whether the port is open or closed, but whether the port is filtered or <b>unfiltered.</b> This is especially good when attempting to probe for the existence of a firewall and its rulesets. Simple packet filtering will allow established connections (packets with the ACK bit set), whereas a more sophisticated stateful firewall might not.|$|E
25|$|Apart from mosquitoes, Gibraltar's cisterns {{had other}} major hygiene problems. The water they stored was <b>unfiltered</b> {{and they were}} often located {{alongside}} functional areas such as kitchens, privies and areas for animals such as poultry. Gibraltar's colony of Barbary macaques added to the problem by fouling the rooftops and cisterns. The water was notionally fresh but in reality the cisterns tended to accumulate unhygienic debris of various types.|$|E
25|$|Rice {{is used to}} make {{a number}} of items, outside of the {{traditional}} bowl of plain white rice. It is commonly ground into a flour and used to make rice cakes called tteok in over two hundred varieties. It is also cooked down into a congee (juk), or gruel (mieum) and mixed with other grains, meat, or seafood. Koreans also produce a number of rice wines, both in filtered and <b>unfiltered</b> versions.|$|E
25|$|Advpng from package AdvanceCOMP {{was made}} to use the DEFLATE {{implementation}} in 7-zip's LZMA SDK (which is slower but has smaller output than zlib), to optimize png files. However, since PNG is filtered before deflate compression, while advpng uses filter 0 globally (in other words it only uses <b>unfiltered</b> data), it's not a good consideration for png optimization. (In most scenarios, filtering helps more than a good deflater.)Advdef from the same package, however, is able to recompress the zlib stream, acting as a re-deflater.|$|E
25|$|If the use {{of these}} methods is impossible, or if their use did not reduce the {{concentration}} of harmful substances to a safe value, workers must use respirators. These respirators must be sufficiently effective, and they should correspond to known or expected conditions at the workplace. However, it is the least effective method of protection; and the reasons for the decrease of their efficiency often are: non-usage of the respirators in the contaminated atmosphere; leakage of <b>unfiltered</b> air through the gaps between the mask and face; and delayed replacement of gas cartridges.|$|E
25|$|The IARC and WHO {{designate}} {{airborne particulates}} a Group 1 carcinogen. Particulates are the deadliest form {{of air pollution}} due {{to their ability to}} penetrate deep into the lungs and blood streams <b>unfiltered,</b> causing permanent DNA mutations, heart attacks, and premature death. In 2013, a study involving 312,944 people in nine European countries revealed that there was no safe level of particulates and that for every increase of 10 μg/m3 in PM10, the lung cancer rate rose 22%. The smaller PM2.5 were particularly deadly, with a 36% increase in lung cancer per 10 μg/m3 as it can penetrate deeper into the lungs.|$|E
25|$|Cunningham's novel also mirrors Mrs. Dalloway's stream-of-consciousness {{narrative}} style (a style {{pioneered by}} Woolf and James Joyce) {{in which the}} flowing thoughts and perceptions of protagonists are depicted as they would occur in real life, <b>unfiltered,</b> flitting from one thing to another, and often rather unpredictable. In terms of time, this means characters interact {{not only with the}} moment in the time in which they are living, but also shoot back to the past in their memories, and in so doing create a depth of history and backstory which weighs upon their present moments, which otherwise might appear quite trivial; buying flowers, baking a cake and such things.|$|E
25|$|Air mass affects output. In space, {{where there}} is no atmosphere, the {{spectrum}} of the sun is relatively <b>unfiltered.</b> However, on earth, air filters the incoming light, changing the solar spectrum. The filtering effect ranges from Air Mass 0 (AM0) in space, to approximately Air Mass 1.5 on Earth. Multiplying the spectral differences by the quantum efficiency of the solar cell in question yields the efficiency. Terrestrial efficiencies typically are greater than space efficiencies. For example, a silicon solar cell in space might have an efficiency of 14% at AM0, but 16% on earth at AM 1.5. Note, however, that the number of incident photons in space is considerably larger, so the solar cell might produce considerably more power in space, despite the lower efficiency as indicated by reduced percentage of the total incident energy captured.|$|E
25|$|The {{study showed}} that the three models of full face masks had a {{significant}} leakage of <b>unfiltered</b> air through the gaps between the mask and the face. The minimum values of the workplace protection factors (WPF) {{of each of the}} three negative pressure full face mask models were 11, 17 and 26. The maximum value of the WPF from one of the models did not exceed 500 no times at all. And for all results together, the WPF was not more than 100 in ~ 30% of the measurements. So, for this reason, the values of the APFs for this RPD type in Germany (400), Finland (500), Italy (400), and Sweden (500), may not fully take into account the lower this type respirators' performance at the workplace compared to the performance in the laboratory (during certification). The same was true for other RPD types and their APF.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the highly}} toxic {{health effects of}} {{particulate}} matter, most governments have created regulations both for the emissions allowed from certain types of pollution sources (motor vehicles, industrial emissions etc.) and for the ambient concentration of particulates. The IARC and WHO designates particulates a Group 1 carcinogen. Particulates are the deadliest form of air pollution due {{to their ability to}} penetrate deep into the lungs and blood streams <b>unfiltered,</b> causing permanent DNA mutations, heart attacks and premature death. In 2013, the ESCAPE study involving 312,944 people in nine European countries revealed that there was no safe level of particulates, and that for every increase of 10 μg/m3 in PM10, the lung cancer rate rose 22%. For PM2.5 there was a 36% increase in lung cancer per 10 μg/m3. In a 2014 metaanalysis of 18 studies globally including the ESCAPE data, for every increase of 10 μg/m3 in PM2.5, the lung cancer rate rose 9%.|$|E

Lately was praised for its non-formulaic production and original material. Ivy was also outed for being unlike other New York City bands. The EP was reissued on August 26, 2003 after Ivy transferred their entire music catalog to <b>Unfiltered</b> Records, a record label founded by Chase during work for his side project Brookville.|$|E
500|$|On October 1, 2014, Jeter's new website, ThePlayersTribune.com, {{appeared}} online; it {{was billed}} as [...] "a new media platform that will present the <b>unfiltered</b> voice of professional athletes, bringing fans closer to the games they love than ever before". It was reported by the Tampa Bay Business Journal in March 2015 that Jeter had partnered with Concessions Tampa to bid for a space within the Tampa International Airport, and {{plans to open a}} restaurant named after his website.|$|E
