5|$|In 2010 Sports Illustrated {{selected}} the top 25 sports franchises {{of the decade}} 2000–2009. The sports <b>under</b> <b>consideration</b> were the four major professional sports (NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL) along with the three most prominent college sports: football, men's basketball and women's basketball. The Connecticut Huskies were the #3 selection on the list, behind only the professional basketball Lakers and the professional football Patriots, making the Connecticut women's basketball team the highest ranked of the collegiate teams for the three sports <b>under</b> <b>consideration.</b> During this period, UConn won five national titles, while making the Final Four seven of the ten years. Two of the seasons (2001–02 and 2008–09) resulted in perfect 39–0 records.|$|E

5|$|On October 1, {{an apology}} letter from Blount was {{published}} in the Oregon school newspaper the Oregon Daily Emerald. Later that day, the Oregon Athletic Department released a statement indicating that a plan that could reinstate Blount to the team was <b>under</b> <b>consideration.</b> The next day, head coach Chip Kelly announced that if Blount meets certain guidelines, he could return for the November 7 game against the Stanford Cardinal. Pac-10 commissioner Larry Scott responded that the conference alone had the power to reinstate Blount and would take Oregon's appeal <b>under</b> <b>consideration</b> if it occurred.|$|E

5|$|A {{replacement}} for Melbourne was <b>under</b> <b>consideration</b> {{as early as}} 1956, and the question was revisited on several occasions until the 1980s.

5|$|As of April 1996, {{the option}} to order the seventh and eighth {{submarines}} was still <b>under</b> <b>consideration,</b> but was looked on unfavourably by the Department of Defence at the time, as the additional cost would require the diversion of funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, resulting in an imbalance in {{the capabilities of the}} Australian Defence Force.
