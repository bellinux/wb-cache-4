5|$|A sexual {{harassment}} lawsuit was filed against Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{in the previous}} episode, and she must take a {{sexual harassment}} training as a result. In addition, she cannot return to work until she is done with her training. Liz, however, cannot handle life without work, as she needs the stress. Her attitude changes when she meets one of her neighbors, Emily (Elizabeth Marvel). She <b>understands</b> <b>how</b> Liz feels because she was just like Liz and tells her there are better ways to live. Liz hangs out with Emily and her friends (Mary Catherine Garrison, Kerry Butler, and Christina Gausas), who spend majority of their time getting spa treatments and going shopping. Liz gets {{so caught up in}} their lifestyle that she forgets to watch her show, The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). Not wanting to come back to work—as she is intrigued by her new friends' lifestyle—Liz sexually harasses her counselor, Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane). She goes back to hanging out with Emily and her friends, but soon discovers that they are a Girl Fight Club, which disappoints Liz. In order for her to get out, Liz needs to fight them.|$|E

500|$|According to Michael Paoletta from Billboard, [...] "no fierce-ruling club DJ in 1999 would [...] dared {{play the}} {{original}} jangly rock-etched {{version of the}} song". Hence the song was remixed by Victor Calderone, who kept {{the basic structure of}} the song, while mixing it with tribal infused beats. Unlike many of his then releases—where he removed the bulk of the song's lyrics for remixing—with [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] he kept them. Paoletta described the remixes as [...] "if Calderone fully understands the importance of a song and <b>understands</b> <b>how</b> best to unite deft beats and a dazzling vocal performance." [...] The remixes include a rock-leaning version as well as Calderone's Club and Radio mixes.|$|E
500|$|Favorable {{reviews of}} Eragon often {{focused on the}} book's {{characters}} and plot. IGN's Matt Casamassina called the book [...] "entertaining", and added that [...] "Paolini demonstrates that he <b>understands</b> <b>how</b> to hold the reader's eyes {{and this is what}} ultimately separates Eragon from countless other me-too fantasy novels." [...] Chris Lawrence of About.com thought the book had all the [...] "traditional ingredients" [...] that make a fantasy novel [...] "enjoyable". The book was a [...] "fun read" [...] for him because it is [...] "quick and exciting" [...] and [...] "packed" [...] with action and magic. Lawrence concluded his review by giving the book a rating of 3.8/5, commenting that [...] "the characters are interesting, the plot is engrossing, and you know the good guy will win in the end." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2015, Isenhour {{replaced}} Katie McGinty as Wolf's Chief of Staff, after McGinty resigned {{six months}} into her tenure {{to pursue a}} campaign for U.S. Senate. Wolf called Isenhour [...] "one of my closest advisors" [...] and [...] "a valuable part of my administration", and said she [...] "really <b>understands</b> <b>how</b> {{the politics of this}} place actually works." [...] The selection was praised by both parties, including House and Senate Republicans, who expressed hope she would be less adversarial than McGinty. The Butler Eagle wrote an editorial criticizing the appointment due to her position on the Planned Parenthood of Pennsylvania board, in light of a national controversy over undercover videos about the group's alleged sale of aborted fetal body parts. Isenhour came into the Chief of Staff position more than three weeks into a budget impasse between Wolf and the Republican-controlled General Assembly.|$|E

Malik's management team reached out to him because Zayn was a fan of his work with artists such as John Legend, Alicia Keys and Frank Ocean. Later, Ho heard [...] "Pillowtalk" [...] and [...] "Fool for You" [...] before signing on to produce the record, and thought Malik's voice was [...] "incredible" [...] and agreed to work with him. The two recorded most of the songs in the Studio Suite at the Palms Casino Resort, inside Malik’s Beverly Hills Hotel room, {{and in the middle of}} the woods. As recalled by Ho, the work had a [...] "super creative, super free" [...] atmosphere. Zayn admitted that [...] "He’s just an amazing person. Like from the second I met him I just knew he was kind of different. He looks into every instrument in high detail and he <b>understands</b> <b>how</b> to break it down." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{creating}} Rain World, Joar Jakobsson was a graphic designer in Sweden who taught himself how to animate sprites. He had played few games {{and had little}} industry experience when development began in 2011. He began with a sketch of an elongated cat, which was named [...] "Slugcat" [...] {{by one of his}} YouTube viewers, though the character has no official name. Jakobsson had previous interest in derelict environments, and what they reveal about the humans who previously occupied them. Partly inspired by his feelings of foreignness while living as an exchange student in Seoul, South Korea, a core idea in the game's development was to recreate the life of [...] "the rat in Manhattan". This rat <b>understands</b> <b>how</b> to find food, hide, and live in the subway, but does not understand the subway's structuring purpose or why it was built. Jakobsson and his development partner, James Primate, hoped that players would similarly feel as if they were close to making sense of the game's abstraction of an industrial environment without fully understanding. Jakobsson designed Rain World enemies to live their own lives, in which they hunt for food and struggle to survive, rather than serve as obstacles for the player. Enemy placements are randomly generated, and in final playtests a week prior to release, the developers noted how some players became more or less interested in the game based on the luck of their enemy spawns. The developers expected players to learn to avoid combat and play the game primarily through stealth and flight.|$|E

2500|$|All {{respirators}} function {{by forming}} a seal on the users {{face with the}} respirator itself.

[...] Fit testing uses simple equipment that places the users face and head into a hood, into which flavored mist is sprayed, usually either bitter or sweet in flavor, with bitter flavors being favored for the almost involuntary reaction of users. [...] Following a standard procedure, the user then breathes through the chosen respirator, and indicates whether they can detect the mist. [...] If they cannot, the filter has passed the basic requirement of a face seal and the user also <b>understands</b> <b>how</b> to fit the mask.|$|E

2500|$|Anderson {{plays at}} a {{deliberate}} pace, {{and he is}} not as fast as more athletically gifted players. He is able to change speeds and fake out his opponents to keep them off balance. His methodical style earned him the nickname [...] "Slow Mo" [...] in eighth grade in AAU, and the name has stuck with him. [...] " [...] really <b>understands</b> <b>how</b> to use his speed—he's not super fast, but he's super bright and really knows how to use angles," [...] said Kevin Boyle, who coached Anderson on the national team in 2012. USA Today described him as [...] "languid but quick enough to lead the fast break". Anderson's defense is considered a weakness, and his teams usually play zone as he struggles containing smaller, quicker guards while playing man-to-man.|$|E

2500|$|The games use a text parser for {{entering}} commands at the [...] "What now?" [...] prompt. [...] The parser can interpret {{more than a}} thousand words to control movement or actions. [...] It looks at the command, picking out two or three words it knows, ignoring the order, and tries to guess what is meant. [...] For movement, the usual commands for moving 'NORTH', 'SOUTH', 'EAST' and 'WEST' are available (and their abbreviated forms of 'N', 'S', 'E' and 'W') as well as 'UP' and 'DOWN' ('U' and 'D' respectively) {{and a number of other}} directions and 'modes' of movement (like 'JUMP'). [...] For actions, it <b>understands</b> <b>how</b> to pick up objects, opening doors, lighting lamps, as well as dropping objects and wielding them. [...] Additionally, there are commands to invoke 'SAVE' and 'RESTORE' of game positions to cassette tape or floppy disk (for some systems also to RAM), ask for 'HELP', turn off pictures and turn them on again with 'WORDS' and 'PICTURES' respectively, an 'OOPS' command to undo previous commands.|$|E
