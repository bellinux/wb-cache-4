On the one hand were companies which were statutorily exempt from taxation in their jurisdiction of registration provided {{that they did not}} <b>undertake</b> <b>business</b> <b>with</b> persons resident in that jurisdiction. Such companies were usually called International Business Companies, or IBCs. Such companies were largely popularized by the British Virgin Islands, but the model was copied widely. However, in the early 2000s the OECD launched a global initiative to prevent [...] "ring fencing" [...] of taxation in this manner, and many leading jurisdictions (including the British Virgin Islands and Gibraltar) repealed their International Business Companies legislation. But IBCs are still incorporated in a number of jurisdictions today including Anguilla and Panama.|$|E

40|$|Much of {{the work}} on {{stereotypes}} has focused on discrimination for women and minorities in the workplace. Stereotypes, however, can also exist among managers, potentially influencing their judgement when <b>undertaking</b> <b>business</b> deals <b>with</b> counterparts from other countries. Paul Burns, Andrew Myers and Andrew Kakabadse present results from a survey that {{was carried out by}} the 3 i/Cranfield European Enterprise Centre at Cranfield. Over 1, 000 managers from SMEs in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom responded to the survey. Each manager scored their country and the remaining countries on a number of criteria, the key ones being trust, punctuality, humour, competence and reliability. The survey highlights a number of differing perceptions that managers have of managers from other nations. For example, British managers rate themselves highly on competence, whereas other European managers, notably from Italy and Spain, do not rate them as high. Such perceptions could lead to discrimination when choosing a European supplier for example. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a piece of applied research. It {{is the result of a}} joint project between the University of Aston Interdisciplinary Higher Degrees Scheme and International Aeradio plc (IAL). It {{considers}} the structure and organisation of overseas business and the effects that exchange rate movements have on financial performance. It looks in detail at a series of overseas contracts and factors which affect the monitoring and performance of those contracts. From this initial research is developed a series of conceptual models which attempt to capture the effects of foreign exchange rate movements on contract costing, the monitoring of performance on overseas contracts and a measure of company wide exposure. These models are then considered in the context of real IAL generated data and circumstances. The work is finally considered in the context of a survey of other companies with a similar mode of <b>undertaking</b> overseas <b>business</b> <b>with</b> the aim of placing the work in a general context...|$|R

The {{purpose of the study was}} to gain an understanding of what constitutes knowledge sharing for the sustainable and utilisation of estuaries in the Eastern Cape. Knowledge sharing and distribution is key to the success of many processes in society. Scholars have demonstrated that sharing knowledge is problematic in most organizations, whether they are formal or informal. Knowledge sharing is even more problematic in “open” systems than in “closed ” bureaucratic ones. Knowledge should be shared and distributed in any environment, be it a “closed” <b>business</b> <b>undertaking</b> <b>with</b> formal structures or in an “open ” system composed of different stakeholders with different organizational allegiances. Although there are in existence useful and effective knowledge sharing techniques that are used in formal organizations and “closed ” systems, they are not wholly suitable for “open ” systems.
