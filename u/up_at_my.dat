When asked when he first acknowledged his sexuality, Fry quipped: [...] "I suppose it all began when I {{came out of the}} womb. I looked back <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> mother and thought to myself, 'That's the last time I'm going up one of those'." [...] Fry was in a 15-year relationship with Daniel Cohen, which ended in 2010. In 2016, Fry was listed number 2 on the World Pride Power list.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2002, Morey {{was interviewed}} by Mark Ellis, {{assistant}} pastor at Calvary Evangelical Free Church in Laguna Beach. Based on that conversation, Ellis wrote [...] "Islam Expert Warns of [...] Nuclear Terror Devices Inside U.S.," [...] an article for the Christian news service ASSIST. Morey explained in the interview [...] "I have Middle Eastern friends throughout the U.S. who continually feed me information {{as to what the}} terrorists are up to". [...] "I, in turn, feed that information to the FBI and Naval Intelligence. I’ve been right so many times the FBI showed <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> house, suspicious {{as to whether or not}} I was somehow involved—because I knew too much. I simply pointed out to them they don’t have their ear to the ground in the Middle Eastern community." ...|$|E

A very fiery young man was making a speech from a soapbox on the corner. A little knot of men, women, and {{children}} had collected about him. He was pointing <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> window — at me. He was saying things about us. I strained to hear... 'Municipal Ownership is no solution,' he cried, 'so long as the propertied classes own the municipalities. J.G. Phelps Stokes is a rich man — a man of property; he belongs to the capitalist class. The Municipal Ownership League is a rich man's creation. W.R. Hearst belongs in the millionaire class. This is his government. He doesn't {{want to change the}} government. The Socialist Party, the workers' party, and what we want is a government of, for, and by the people who work.' 'Hear, hear!' I called down, leaning far out of the window and clapping my hands.|$|E

2500|$|The {{dynamics}} {{of their relationship}} were clear from the start, with Bianca portrayed as the dominant, bossy and authoritative partner, while Ricky was shown as the hen-pecked, dim-witted [...] "loser" [...] or [...] "soft touch", comically under the thumb of his female counterpart. James Rampton from The Independent has commented, [...] "to her eternally put-upon husband, Ricky, Bianca was a ferocious reincarnation of H Rider Haggard's 'She Who Must Be Obeyed'." [...] Bianca was notorious for shouting the catchphrase [...] "Rickaaaaaaay!" [...] (a cockney pronunciation of Ricky) at her lover, and Palmer admitted in 2008 that [...] "not a day has gone by in nine years when someone hasn't shouted that from cars and even <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> bedroom window at night." [...] Rampton has suggested that Bianca's catchphrase – [...] "Rickaaaaaaay!" [...] – transitioned, becoming [...] "shorthand for any sort of heinous henpecking." [...] On Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on 18 April 2008, Palmer explained that it was actually Ross, as a DJ, who had originally inspired the catchphrase.|$|E
6000|$|When I looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> love-birds [...] That Sunday afternoon, [...] There was {{in their}} tiny tune A dying fetch like broken words, When I looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> love-birds [...] That Sunday afternoon.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{he commented}} {{on his new}} feat, {{but it was also}} a {{reminder}} to me, a trifle cruel, that he was not my boy. After all, you see, Mary had not given him the whole of his laugh. The watch said that five and twenty minutes had passed, and looking out I saw Irene at one end of the street staring <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> window, and at the other end Mary's husband staring <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> window, and beneath me Mary staring <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> window. They had all broken their promise.|$|E
6000|$|... "--Being a few private friends {{asked in}} to-night to keep <b>up</b> club-walking <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own expense." [...] The landlady had rapidly re-used the formula {{she kept on}} hand for intruders before she {{recognized}} that the newcomer was Tess.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he has a}} mode {{of expressing}} himself without speaking, which I do not choose to put <b>up</b> with <b>at</b> <b>my</b> table. The fact is {{they are going to}} the {{mischief}} at the rectory. His eldest girl has just married a curate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{thought you}} one whit like Madame Ginevra, I would not sit here {{waiting for your}} communications. I would get <b>up,</b> walk <b>at</b> <b>my</b> ease about the room, and {{anticipate}} {{all you had to}} say by a round lecture. Go on." ...|$|R
60|$|And Dahlia {{was in the}} drawing-room. She glanced <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> entrance.|$|E

60|$|JUNO. No: {{that was}} what was so tame about it. I wanted to suffer. You get so sick of being happily married. It's always the happy marriages that break <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> last <b>my</b> wife and I agreed that we ought to take a holiday.|$|R
6000|$|So they started, and I lit out, {{all in a}} cold sweat, and {{scrambled}} forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, {{in a kind of}} a coarse whisper, [...] "Jim!" [...] and he answered <b>up,</b> right <b>at</b> <b>my</b> elbow, with a sort of a moan, and I says: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why," [...] said I, glancing <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> companion, [...] "that {{was surely}} the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, indeed,' {{said his}} mother; 'we {{had so much}} game <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> brother's, Lord Northmoor's, that I shall quite miss it now I am come away.' ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the centre}} of the room she paused, and, {{throwing}} back the dark veil which enveloped her face, she looked straight <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> Lord High Steward.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot tell; we did {{not wish}} to renew the subject. The worst of it was, that my aunt, who hears everything, found this out. She interrogated me, and wanted me to give it to Theodora, a mere baby. I felt as if I was {{defending}} Helen's possession, and refused to give it <b>up</b> unless <b>at</b> <b>my</b> father's command.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "--Being a few private friends I've {{asked in}} to keep <b>up</b> club-walking <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own expense," [...] the landlady exclaimed {{at the sound}} of footsteps, as glibly as a child repeating the Catechism, while she peered over the stairs. [...] "Oh, 'tis you, Mrs Durbeyfield--Lard--how you frightened me!--I thought it might be some gaffer sent by Gover'ment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} been showing Mr. Hack some of his verses, which he sat <b>up</b> last night, <b>at</b> <b>my</b> request, to write; and Hack talks about giving him {{a copy of the}} book--the what-d'-you-call-'em." ...|$|R

60|$|Wildly and more--wildly he teetered, {{grinning}} at me his gloating hatred. Then came the end. All four holds broke {{at the same}} time, and I fell, back-downward, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, <b>my</b> hands and feet still clutching the broken twigs. Luckily, there were no wild pigs under me, and my fall was broken by the tough and springy bushes.|$|R
60|$|But if you {{can really}} grasp the shameful grotesqueness of the old life, you will begin to {{appreciate}} the interpretation of old Mrs. Verrall's appearance that leapt <b>up</b> <b>at</b> once in <b>my</b> mind.|$|R

60|$|In the end, just as I {{was about}} to trek seawards, an old friend, Maputa, turned <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> wagons--that same man who had brought me the message from Panda before we started to attack Bangu.|$|E
60|$|My {{companion}} flushed <b>up</b> {{with pleasure}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> words, and the earnest {{way in which}} I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{let me go}} <b>up</b> {{and look}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> old little room, and rest there a few minutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go with me {{as far as the}} finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say good by!" ...|$|R
