Data for the analysis was collected from the past sales transactions of 20 estate surveying and Valuation firms in Akure, Nigeria. The number of estate surveying and valuation firms were gotten from the 2014 register of the Heads of firms of the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers, Ondo State Branch.

The study therefore, recommended that government should open <b>up</b> more land <b>for</b> development to individuals since undeveloped land were more favoured in the areas...|$|R
