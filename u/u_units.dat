40|$|Background We {{hypothesised}} that {{concentrations of}} interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) would increase during storage {{in the third}} sequential <b>unit</b> (<b>U</b> 3) of canine {{packed red blood cells}} (PRBC) collected from terminal donors in haemorrhagic shock. We further hypothesised that leucoreduction would prevent cytokine accumulation in U 3 and that cytokine concentrations in U 3 would be higher than in the first <b>units</b> (<b>U</b> 1) collected from the same dogs. Methods U 1 and U 3 were each collected from 12 anaesthetised healthy Greyhounds. Removal of leucocytes from half of each PRBC unit produced one leucoreduced (LR) and one non-leucoreduced (NLR) unit. Canine IL- 8, IL- 1 β and TNF-α concentrations were measured in samples collected from the units during storage on days 0, 10, 20, 30 and 37. Results The IL- 8 concentration in <b>U</b> 3 NLR <b>units</b> was significantly higher on days 10, 20, 30 and 37 than on day 0 and was significantly higher than in the LR units at all time points. The IL- 1 β concentration in U 3 did not change over time, or between LR and NLR units. TNF-α was not detected in any unit. There {{were no significant differences in}} IL- 8 or IL- 1 β concentrations between U 3 and U 1 at any time point; however, some NLR <b>U</b> 3 <b>units</b> had markedly elevated IL- 8 concentrations at day 37 (2060 – 20, 682 pg/mL) compared with NLR <b>U</b> 1 <b>units</b> (3369 – 5280 pg/mL). Conclusion NLR <b>U</b> 3 <b>units</b> collected from dogs in haemorrhagic shock showed a significant increase in IL- 8 concentrations during storage.

40|$|Output Prediction Logic (OPL) is a {{technique}} {{that can be applied}} to conventional CMOS logic families to obtain considerable speedups. When applied to static CMOS, OPL retains the restoring character of the logic family. Speedups of 2 x 10 3 X over (optimized) conventional static CMOS are demonstrated for a variety of circuits, ranging from chains of gates, to datapath circuits, and to random logic benchmarks. Such speedups are obtained using identical netlists without remapping. When applied to pseudo-nMOS and dynamic families in combinarion with remapping to wide-input NORs, OPL yields even greater speedups over static CMOS. In this paper we present a novel 64 -bit adder design implemented in OPL using a combination of %bit Carry Look Ahead and Carry Select. The very fast wide-input OPL NORs enabled the use of 8 -bit C <b>U</b> <b>units</b> instead of the usual 4 -bit.
