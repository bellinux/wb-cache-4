50|$|Carnotaurus is eponymous for two {{subgroups of}} the Abelisauridae: the Carnotaurinae and the Carnotaurini. Paleontologists do not <b>universally</b> <b>accept</b> these groups. The Carnotaurinae was defined {{to include all}} derived abelisaurids with the {{exclusion}} of Abelisaurus, which is considered a basal member in most studies. However, a 2008 review suggested that Abelisaurus was a derived abelisaurid instead. Carnotaurini was proposed to name the clade formed by Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus; only those paleontologists who consider Aucasaurus as the nearest relative of Carnotaurus use this group.|$|R
5|$|Originally, this genus was {{believed}} to be a prosauropod because of the knife-shaped teeth found near its fossils, which fit in with the idea that prosauropods were omnivorous. Scientists now know that the teeth belonged to an unidentified theropod that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass. Vulcanodon is now known to be a true sauropod. Upon the discovery of the related Tazoudasaurus, both animals were unified in the family Vulcanodontidae, though this has not been <b>universally</b> <b>accepted.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Biological {{definitions}} of race encompass essentialist and anti-essentialist views. The scientific community does not <b>universally</b> <b>accept</b> a single definition of race.

Essentialists describe [...] "races as groups of people who share certain innate, inherited biological traits, aka use of biological evidence to demonstrate racial differences". As its counterpart, anti-essentialism uses biological evidence to demonstrate that [...] "race groupings do not reflect patterns of human biological variation, countering essentialist claims to the contrary".|$|R
5|$|According to The Official Charts Company and Guinness' British Hit Singles & Albums, the NME is {{considered}} the official British singles chart before 10 March 1960. However, until 15 February 1969, when the British Market Research Bureau chart was established, there was no <b>universally</b> <b>accepted</b> chart. Other charts existed and different artists may have placed at number one in charts by Record Mirror, Disc or Melody Maker. Alternatively, some considered BBC's Pick of the Pops, which averaged all these charts, {{to be a better}} indicator of the number-one single.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{also pointed}} out that the index could allow the city to reach lethally high levels of carbon {{monoxide}} without any alert if the levels of other pollutants remained low. However, the department had to contend with the fact that no <b>universally</b> <b>accepted</b> standards for recording smog existed at that time, and many of the flaws existed {{for lack of a better}} alternative.

5|$|During the 9th century AD, {{the central}} Maya region {{suffered}} major political collapse, {{marked by the}} abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties, and a northward shift in activity. No <b>universally</b> <b>accepted</b> theory explains this collapse, but it likely had a combination of causes, including endemic internecine warfare, overpopulation resulting in severe environmental degradation, and drought. During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and Uxmal showed increased activity. Major cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.|$|E

2500|$|The {{degree to}} which the area in front of the mouth is {{segmented}} remains one of the major controversies in the arthropod head problem. As already mentioned, earlier workers often considered the entire pre-oral region to be [...] "acronal" [...] and thus nonsegmental. Modern workers <b>universally</b> <b>accept</b> that at least the deuterocerebrum is segmental. However, the nature of the region in front of this is much less certain.

The idea of the protocerebrum actually comprising two segments has also received support from both molecular and embryological data.|$|R

5|$|Lochlann, {{originally}} Laithlinn or Lothlend, {{the land}} where Amlaíb's father was king, is often identified with Norway, {{but it is not}} <b>universally</b> <b>accepted</b> that it had such a meaning in early times. Several historians have proposed instead that in early times, and certainly as late as the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, Laithlinn refers to the Norse and Norse-Gael lands in the Hebrides, the Isle of Man, the Northern Isles and parts of mainland Scotland. Whatever the original sense, by the twelfth century, when Magnus Barefoot undertook his expedition to the West, it had come to mean Norway.|$|E
5|$|Ostrom's {{description}} of Deinonychus in 1969 {{has been described}} as the most important single discovery of dinosaur paleontology in the mid-20th century. The discovery of this clearly active, agile predator did much to change the scientific (and popular) conception of dinosaurs and opened the door to speculation that dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded. This development has been termed the dinosaur renaissance. Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the forefeet of Deinonychus and that of birds, an observation which led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs. Forty years later, this idea is almost <b>universally</b> <b>accepted.</b>|$|E
40|$|Precise {{measurement}} {{of teaching and}} learning has long been an elusive goal of professional educators.

5|$|The {{establishment}} of <b>universally</b> <b>accepted</b> conventions for {{the naming of}} organisms was Linnaeus' main contribution to taxonomy—his work marks {{the starting point of}} consistent use of binomial nomenclature.

5000|$|The literal {{translation}} of the μωρανθῇ, mōranthē, [...] "loses its savour", is [...] "becomes foolish". In Aramaic the same term is used for losing savour and becoming foolish.

Gundry feels {{that the idea of}} foolish salt is such [...] "utter nonsense" [...] that no translator would ever make such a mistake; he feels {{it is more likely that}} the Semitic expression had been assimilated into Greek and that became foolish was an expression for losing savour. English language translators <b>universally</b> <b>accept</b> that the verse is talking about flavour rather than intelligence.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{algebraic}} {{characterization of the}} class DLIN of functions that can be computed in linear time by a deterministic RAM using only numbers of linear size is given. This class was introduced by Grandjean, who showed that it is robust and contains most computational problems that are usually considered to be solvable in deterministic linear time. The characterization {{is in terms of}} a recursion scheme for unary functions. A variation of this recursion scheme characterizes DLINEAR, the class which allows polynomially large numbers. A second variation defines a class that still contains DTIME(n), the class of functions that are computable in linear time on a Turing machine. From these algebraic characterizations, logical characterizations of DLIN and DLINEAR as well as complete problems (under DTIME(n) reductions) are derived. 1 Introduction Although deterministic linear time is a frequently used notion in the theory of algorithms it still does not have a <b>universally</b> <b>accept</b> [...] ...|$|R
