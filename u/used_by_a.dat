5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line is often <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> dive leader {{to allow the}} boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{was found}} {{shattered}} into thousands of pieces and is now heavily corroded, the helmet still bears evidence of its original finely decorated design. It was plated with silver-gilt and decorated with images of goddesses and equestrian scenes.

The identity of the owner is not known but the helmet was discovered on a native British ceremonial site, buried alongside thousands of Iron Age British and Roman coins. It {{is possible that the}} helmet was owned by a Briton who fought alongside the Romans during the conquest of Britain.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{toxicity}} of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.

The drug was <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> diverse range of social groups. Whilst the evidence was anecdotal, researchers, charity workers, teachers and users reported widespread and increasing use of the drug in 2009.

5|$|Bioluminescence is <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{variety of}} animals to mimic other species.

The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to {{within striking distance of}} the fish.|$|E
5|$|Debt service {{funds are}} used to account for money {{that will be used}} to pay the {{interest}} and principal of long-term debts. Bonds <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> government to finance major construction projects, to be paid by tax levies over a period of years, require a debt service fund to account for their repayment. The debts of permanent and proprietary funds are serviced within those funds, rather than by a separate debt service fund.|$|E

5|$|Historians are {{agreed that}} the {{introduction}} and conclusion were added by a different author {{than that of the}} Libellus. Who that was, however, is open to debate. The historian C. W.

David also felt that the Vita was <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> later work of Symeon's, the Historia Regum. Offler, however, felt that although Symeon knew of the Libellus, there was no evidence that he used the Vita, which would leave the author of the Vita unclear.|$|E

5|$|In many human {{cultures}}, {{the act of}} premastication {{and direct}} mouth-to-mouth feeding is linked with the showing of affection, known as kiss feeding.

Some human cultures such as the people of Papua New Guinea in fact use mouth to mouth contact primarily for feeding premasticated food, with sexual kissing only observed after the arrival of Europeans.

5|$|In {{telecommunication}} networks, heterodyning {{is used to}} move {{frequencies of}} individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> cable television system can carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E
