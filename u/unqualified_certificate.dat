50|$|In 2011, SMESH again {{emerged as}} the best {{boarding}} school in Sabah after the school performance in SPM 2010 recorded increment from 2.22 to 2.14 GPS, the best year ever recorded. The GPS indicator is widely used as a national school performance indicator endorsed by the Ministry of Education. However, year 2011 saw slightest drop in PMR result where out of 5 classes, only 2 classes scored Straight A's, thus no longer retaining the position as the best school in Sabah for PMR, coming second behind SM Sains Lahad Datu. Apart from academic achievements, the school is certified by Auditor-General of Malaysia with Sijil Tanpa Teguran or <b>Unqualified</b> <b>Certificate</b> where the auditor is completely satisfied with the true and fairness of financial statements. At the moment, the school is thoroughly audited by SIRIM for MS ISO 9001:2008 certification.|$|E
50|$|In 1924 the {{auditors}} of Touche Niven (Touche, Niven & Company) gave the rubber importer, Fred Stern and Company, an <b>unqualified</b> audit <b>certificate,</b> {{having failed to}} discover that management had falsified entries to overstate accounts receivable. The auditors knew that the accounts when certified {{would be used to}} raise money and for that purpose supplied 32 certified and serially numbered copies: p. 442. On the faith of one of those copies, given to it on its demand, the plaintiff, Ultramares Corporation, lent Fred Stern and Company money. Stern declared bankruptcy in 1925. Ultramares sued Touche Niven for the amount of the Stern debt, declaring that a careful audit would have shown Stern to be insolvent. The audit was found to be negligent, but not fraudulent. The judge set this finding aside based on the doctrine of privity, which protects auditors from third party suits. An intermediate appellate court reinstated the negligence verdict. The case then went to the New York Court of Appeals, Judge Benjamin Cardozo presiding.|$|R
30|$|High {{proportions}} of <b>unqualified</b> and <b>certificate</b> qualified staff signalled {{low levels of}} investment in the early childhood workforce. The reforms involved a planned investment of $ 73.5 million over four years to raise qualifications of child care workers, including targets of one early childhood teacher for six hours per day at long day care 1 (LDC) and preschool services operating 50 hours or more per week and licensed for 25 or more children (Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authroity 2014). Despite the welcomed investment, this target fell considerably short of the contemporaneous target established by the New Zealand Government: that all teacher-led centre-based ECEC services ensure 50 % of their required staff hold an early childhood teaching qualification (Ministry of Education n. d.). This comparison raises questions about arguments framed around affordability (see for example, the Productivity Commission Report 2013) given that Australia has a considerably higher gross domestic product (GDP) per capita than New Zealand (World Bank 2014) and therefore arguably better {{able to afford to}} invest in a highly qualified early childhood workforce. The sustainability of the reforms seems tenuous because of at least three challenges.|$|R
