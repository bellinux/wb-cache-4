25|$|A {{variety of}} adverse {{reactions}} to lindane pharmaceuticals have been reported, ranging from skin irritation to seizures, and, in rare instances, death. The most common side effects are burning sensations, itching, dryness, and rash.

[...] A similar conclusion was made about the buoyant bomb which could not be <b>used</b> <b>properly</b> without the Mark XIV bombsight. The need for intensive training, a lack of aircraft, priority being given to the Navy, and production limitations for low-level bomb sights; all these factors influenced the policy on torpedo usage.|$|E

[...] Despite the various successes of the Clans, the class was generally regarded as a failure, even with overall performance being just short of Riddles' aims. [...] However, the premise of all British Railways Standard designs was for a hard working, easily maintained, economical, highly available, and all-purpose locomotive. In these respects, the Clans were highly successful.|$|E

He [...] "love how this show is about NBC and really set at NBC", but was worried about the misuse of guest stars. Robert Canning of IGN said that for the first time, Jenna's storyline was the [...] "most {{entertaining}} of the night". He felt that first half of the episode was [...] "tightly written and very funny", but the second half [...] "waned a bit, with less than stellar conclusions to the stories and far less funny bits". Canning said that Jack's storyline was the [...] "most disappointing", and hoped that future guest stars were <b>used</b> <b>properly,</b> rather than for the sake of having a name guest star. George Freitag of BuddyTV said that although Tracy was [...] "not as strong as the previous two episodes", he was [...] "still terrific and the nod to his old SNL skit was a nice touch". He felt {{that the lack of}} focus on the personal life of Liz seemed to give the series [...] "a lack of focus". Freitag hoped that her private issues would be further explored, as [...] "her approachable yet successful persona {{was one of the main}} draws to the series in the first place". Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide felt that the episode [...] "fell a bit flat", and that the season lacked the other TGSers, Lonny, Frank, Twofer and [...] "director guy". He did not enjoy Jack's storyline, but said that Jenna's storyline [...] "ultimately won a thumbs-up from me for her getting turned on by Kenneth's rudeness".|$|E
500|$|Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton {{describe}} de Lucía as a [...] "titanic {{figure in}} the world of flamenco guitar", highlighting his [...] "astounding technique and inventiveness" [...] and his broad range of musical ideas from other styles, such as Brazilian music and jazz. He is noted for his innovation and colour in harmony and his remarkable dexterity, technique, strength and fluidity in his right hand, capable of executing extremely fast and fluent picados. A master of contrast, he often juxtaposes picados with rasgueados and other techniques and often adds abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences. Bill Milkowski of Down Beat described him as [...] "the portrait of studied concentration and pristine perfection: stiff backed and stern faced, with a distinguished air about him that some might misread as haughtiness. He's proud and majestic, like a regal Arabian steed prancing with grace and elegance, yet able to reveal great power." [...] Craig Harris of AllMusic noted his [...] "deeply personal melodic statements and modern instrumentation." [...] Atlanta magazine said, [...] "The guitar, when <b>used</b> <b>properly,</b> {{can be one of the}} most haunting and beautiful instruments to create sound... when he brushes his fingers across the strings, [...] can create some of the most incredible music. It's almost like a lullaby." [...] José Luis Acosta, president of the Spanish Artists and Editors Society stated that [...] "Paco was and will be a universal artist, who took the guitar and flamenco sentiment to the heart of the whole world." [...] In 2015, Billboard magazine named de Lucía as one of The 30 Most Influential Latin Artists of All Time, an editor writes: [...] "The virtuoso intrumentalist popularized flamenco worldwide, and brought the Spanish sound to the forefront of avant-garde jazz.". In the same year, he was posthumously inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame for his contributions to flamenco music.
