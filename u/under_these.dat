5|$|After its {{ratification}} of the Thirteenth Amendment in November 1865, the South Carolina legislature immediately began to legislate Black Codes. The Black Codes created a separate set of laws, punishments, and acceptable behaviors for anyone {{with more than one}} black great-grandparent. <b>Under</b> <b>these</b> Codes, Blacks could only work as farmers or servants and had few Constitutional rights. Restrictions on black land ownership threatened to make economic subservience permanent.|$|E
5|$|Assuming less {{load and}} rolling friction, Raepsaet, in contrast, calculates a maximum pulling force of 27kN, {{which would have}} needed a {{slightly}} smaller towing crew. <b>Under</b> <b>these</b> circumstances, the use of harnessed oxen—which has been refuted by Tolley {{on the basis of}} their relatively diminished pulling capabilities— would have become feasible. However, the necessary expenditure of energy at the Diolkos must be regarded in both scenarios as considerable.|$|E

When the contingency is self-imposed, the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, when the delay is externally imposed, children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration <b>under</b> <b>these</b> circumstances.|$|E

5|$|However, Nosanchuk {{was still}} not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a {{defendant}} found not guilty <b>under</b> <b>these</b> terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting {{on the advice of}} a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a plea bargain, offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty <b>under</b> <b>these</b> terms, the state still had the right to detain him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

Néstor Kirchner had a political dispute with the previous president, Eduardo Duhalde. Their dispute continued during the 2005 midterm elections. Without consensus in the PJ for a single candidate for senator of the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their respective wives run for the office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ, and Cristina Kirchner for the Front for Victory. Cristina Kirchner won the election.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall in the {{dry zone}} of Sri Lanka is limited to 50-75inches. <b>Under</b> <b>these</b> conditions, rain fed {{cultivation}} was difficult, forcing early settlers to develop means to store water {{in order to maintain}} a constant supply of water for their cultivations. Small irrigation tanks were constructed at village level, to support the cultivations of that village. The earliest medium-scale irrigation tank is the Basawakkulama reservoir built by King Pandukabhaya. Nuwara wewa and Tissa Wewa reservoirs were constructed a century later. These reservoirs were enlarged in subsequent years by various rulers.|$|E

The other situations consider ritual death to be better for a mendicant than breaking his or her Five Great vows (Mahavrata).

5|$|Slow-tight {{inhibition}} {{occurs when}} the initial enzyme–inhibitor complex EI undergoes isomerisation to a second more tightly held complex, EI*, but the overall inhibition process is reversible.

The true value of Ki can be obtained through more complex analysis of the on (kon) and off (koff) rate constants for inhibitor association. See irreversible inhibition below for more information.|$|E

5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs <b>under</b> <b>these</b> funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E
