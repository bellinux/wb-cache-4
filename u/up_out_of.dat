5|$|Soon {{after the}} game opens, the player learns that Kendall and Charlotte have just broken <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a lesbian relationship, while a few weeks prior Taylor and Nolan had broken <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a {{heterosexual}} relationship. Arianna develops a crush on the teacher, which in the player's first decision point Rook can reciprocate or not. Akira soon comes out as gay, finding to his dismay that everyone else already knew. He then attempts {{to enter into a}} relationship with Nolan, who is unsure how to respond; Rook can encourage him to try it out or let him decide on his own, but he enters a relationship with Akira regardless.|$|E
5|$|From Rosendale, NY32 climbs <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Rondout {{valley and}} veers east into the hamlet of Maple Hill, where it crosses over the Thruway once again. It resumes a northerly course through Bloomington, and several miles further on crosses the Kingston city line. This entire segment of NY32 is also {{concurrent}} with New York State Bicycle Route32.|$|E

5|$|Northeast Minnesota has 2700-million-year-ago exposed rocks formed during {{volcanic}} activity {{that was in}} the form of seepage of lava from rifts in the sea floor. These lava flows began to rise <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ancient ocean to form the Superior craton; the Superior craton later assembled into the Canadian shield, which became part of the North American craton. The Superior province is the largest preserved fragment of Archean crust, and the Canadian shield is the nucleus of the North American craton.|$|E
5|$|About 20 North Korean {{soldiers}} approached, undiscovered, {{close enough}} to the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, command post west of Haman to throw grenades and fire into it. About 45 soldiers of the battalion command group and 20 South Korean recruits were in position there at the time. The North Koreans were driven off at dawn, but Major Eugene J. Carson, battalion executive officer, then discovered that he had on the position with him only 30 men, 7 of them wounded. Looking back down the hill, Carson saw approximately 40 men get <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the rice paddies and go over to a tank at a roadblock position. These men reported to the regiment that they had been driven off the hill. Three tanks near the command post helped clear the town of North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Silsbee, Texas. As a child, {{he was a big}} wrestling fan and André the Giant was his {{favorite}} wrestler. While attending a wrestling show in Beaumont, Texas, young Henry tried to touch André as he was walking down the aisle, but tripped over the barricade. André picked him <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the crowd and put him back behind the barricade. When Henry was 12 years old, his father, Ernest, died of complications from diabetes. When he was 14 years old, Henry was diagnosed with dyslexia.|$|E

5|$|Masters, as Zissos points out, {{argues that}} the Sibyl's {{commands}} to bury Misenus and find the Golden Bough are inverted and compacted in Lucan: Erichtho needs a bodynot buriedbut rather retrieved. Many other parallels and inversions abound, including: the difference of opinions about the ease of getting what is sought from the underworld (the Sibyl says only the initial descent to the underworld will be easy, whereas Erichtho says necromancy is simple), the opposing manner in which those seeking information from the underworld are described (the Sibyl urges Aeneas to be courageous, whereas Erichtho criticizes Sextus Pompeius for being cowardly), and the inverted {{manner in which the}} supernatural rites proceed (the Sibyl sends Aeneas underground to gain knowledge, whereas Erichtho conjures a spirit <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ground to learn the future).|$|E
5|$|Meyer and {{his friend}} Denny Martin Flinn wrote the {{screenplay}} by the nascent means of e-mail; Meyer lived in Europe while Flinn was based in Los Angeles. The pair worked out a system where Flinn would write all day and then send the draft to Meyer, who would read and make revisions. The script constantly changed because of demands made {{not only by the}} core cast, but also the supporting players. Flinn was aware that the film would be the last to feature the cast of the original television series, so he wrote an opening that embraced the passage of time. In the opening, each of the crew was to be rounded <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> unhappy retirement for one final mission.|$|E
5|$|The Torah {{provides}} four details {{regarding the}} traditions surrounding Joseph’s remains. The account in Genesis relates that, before his death, {{he had his}} brothers swear they would carry his bones out of Egypt to Canaan. He is then {{said to have been}} embalmed then placed in a coffin in Egypt. In Exodus, we are told that Moses fulfilled the pledge by taking Joseph's bones with him when he left Egypt. In Joshua, Joseph’s bones are said to have been brought from Egypt by the Children of Israel and interred in Shechem.The bones of Joseph, which the Children of Israel brought <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Egypt, were buried in Shechem in a parcel of land Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver (qeśîṭâ)..|$|E

5|$|Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) later {{reports to}} Reyes and Scully that Comer has died. Reyes accuses Toothpick Man {{and others in}} the room of killing Comer. Meanwhile, Scully visits Doggett, who warns her not to trust the cultists. However, Scully goes to meet Josepho near Calgary. Josepho claims to be {{protecting}} William, but demands Mulder's head as collateral in exchange for the baby's release. When Josepho returns to the wreck site, the Overcoat Woman relates that the aperture of the craft began to glow when William started crying. The craft soon rises <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ground. Looking on the site from a distance, Scully and Reyes see the craft burst out of an enclosure and into space, lighting the ground beneath it on fire as it goes. The two find an unharmed William among the charred bodies of the cultists.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the end, a bus {{shows up}} outside the Krusty Krab, despite Squidward {{claiming}} that the buses do not run this late at night. The bus then drops off a mysterious dark silhouette matching {{the description of the}} Hash-Slinging Slasher. SpongeBob and Squidward immediately realize that they are experiencing genuine supernatural events and panic. When the strange, unidentified figure enters the building, it is revealed he is simply a kid applying for a job, stating that he had tried calling the Krusty Krab by telephone earlier, but had hung <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> nervousness (the bus that he arrived in remains unexplained). However, Squidward then questions who was flickering the lights earlier. It is then revealed that the flickering lights are caused by doctored footage of Count Orlok from the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar, flicking the light switch on and off.|$|E
5|$|The Anthony Roll was {{originally}} {{a set of}} three separate vellum rolls. It exists today {{in the form of}} a bound volume containing the first and third rolls while the second roll is preserved in its original form. The three original rolls were made <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane. The membranes were of a width of 70cm (27 ½ inches) and a height varying from 79 to 96cm (31 to 37 ¾ inches). After receiving the first and third rolls Pepys had his clerks cut the rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book, now known as Pepys 2991. The transformation of the two rolls created a horizontal page structure, and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand. Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two rolls and a summarizing table that was not Anthony's, but pre-dated Pepys' binding of the rolls. This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated. The first three illustrations of the Henry Grace à Dieu, Mary Rose and Peter Pomegranate were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two-page spreads. The resulting bend down the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail. Despite this, there are no plans to attempt a recreation of the original structure of the first and third rolls. The second roll, British Library Additional MS 22047, is still in its original condition with the exception of a written endorsement by Mary Fox from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing.|$|E

25|$|On June 29, 1974, Tijerina {{began his}} second prison term. During his incarceration {{he came into}} contact with Blas Chávez, a World War II veteran who had been {{involved}} in New Mexico politics and ended <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor with the powerful. He told Tijerina of the corrupt dealings of Senator Joseph Montoya and other politicians, as well as the details behind the murder of Eulogio Salazar.|$|E
25|$|I'd come up {{with this}} kind of {{elaborate}} storyline, and the record was gonna be a concept record that had a number of pretentious elements to it. I was gonna talk about multi-layered reality and waking up in a dream you can't wake <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of,</b> and eventually finding acceptance after you go through this period of trying to fight it. It was all kind of a big analogy for me getting sober.|$|E
25|$|Caves {{can carry}} strong water {{currents}}. Most caves emerge {{on the surface}} as either springs or siphons. Springs have out flowing currents, where water is coming <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Earth and flowing out across the land's surface. Siphons have in-flowing currents where, for example, an above-ground river is going underground. Some caves are complex and have some tunnels with out-flowing currents, and other tunnels with in-flowing currents. If currents are not properly managed, they can cause serious problems for the diver.|$|E

25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} the Israelites were counted on ten occasions: (1) {{when they went}} down to Egypt, (2) when they went <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Egypt, (3) at the first census in Numbers, (4) at the second census in Numbers, (5) once for the banners, (6) once {{in the time of}} Joshua for the {{division}} of the land of Israel, (7) once by Saul, (8) a second time by Saul, (9) once by David, and (10) once in the time of Ezra.|$|E
25|$|In the evening, Crosby did {{the whole}} show before an {{audience}}. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but {{we would have to}} take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.|$|E
25|$|At 8:35 PM, Patrolman Louis E. Galonka, {{attempting}} {{to navigate the}} narrow passage between 1391 and 1395 Lakeview, was shot and killed. Five minutes later, police, firing into the alley from the rear windows of 1391 Lakeview, killed Sidney Curtis Taylor (also known as Malik Ali Bey). At 8:45 PM, Bernard Donald (also known as Nondu Bey) stood <b>up</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> some bushes behind 1395 Lakeview and fired at police in the passage between 1391 and 1395 Lakeview. A patrolman picked up Galonka's shotgun and killed Donald.|$|E
