40|$|Background. Current {{mortality}} rates {{are essential for}} monitoring, understanding and developing policy for a population&#x 0027;s health. Disease-specific Alaska Native {{mortality rates}} have been undergoing change. Objective. This article reports recent mortality data (2004 &#x 2013; 2008) for Alaska Native/American Indian (AN/AI) people, comparing mortality rates to <b>US</b> <b>white</b> rates and examines changes in mortality patterns since 1980. Design. We used death record data {{from the state of}} Alaska, Department of Vital Statistics and SEER*Stat software from the National Cancer Institute to calculate age-adjusted mortality rates. Results. Annual age-adjusted mortality from all-causes for AN/AI persons during the period 2004 &#x 2013; 2008 was 33 % higher than the rate for <b>US</b> <b>whites</b> (RR= 1. 33, 95 % CI 1. 29 &#x 2013; 1. 38). Mortality rates were higher among AN/AI males than AN/AI females (1212 / 100, 000 vs. 886 / 100, 000). Cancer remained {{the leading cause of death}} among AN/AI people, as it has in recent previous periods, with an age-adjusted rate of 226 / 100, 000, yielding a rate ratio (RR) of 1. 24 compared to <b>US</b> <b>whites</b> (95 % CI 1. 14 &#x 2013; 1. 33). Statistically significant higher mortality compared to <b>US</b> <b>white</b> mortality rates was observed for nine of the ten leading causes of AN/AI mortality (cancer, unintentional injury, suicide, alcohol abuse, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], cerebrovascular disease, chronic liver disease, pneumonia/influenza, homicide). Mortality rates were significantly lower among AN/AI people compared to <b>US</b> <b>whites</b> for heart disease (RR= 0. 82), the second leading cause of death. Among leading causes of death for AN/AI people, the greatest disparities in mortality rates with <b>US</b> <b>whites</b> were observed in unintentional injuries (RR= 2. 45) and suicide (RR= 3. 53). All-cause AN/AI mortality has declined 16 % since 1980 &#x 2013; 1983, compared to a 21 % decline over a similar period among <b>US</b> <b>whites.</b> Conclusion. Mortality rates and trends are essential to understanding the health of a population and guiding policy decisions. The overall AN/AI mortality rate is higher than that of <b>US</b> <b>whites,</b> although encouraging declines in mortality have occurred for many cause specific deaths, as well as for the overall rate. The second leading cause of AN/AI mortality, heart disease, remains lower than that of <b>US</b> <b>whites...</b>|$|R

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} considerable {{variability in the}} volumes of different glomeruli in given individuals (individual glomerular volume: IGV) in a stereologic study of kidneys at forensic autopsy performed to investigate sudden or unexpected death in people without manifest kidney disease. We review some important associations of IGV by subject characteristics and by ethnic groups. IGVs were measured by the Cavalieri method in 30 glomeruli in each of 111 adult males who belonged to 4 ethnic groups, i. e. <b>US</b> <b>Whites,</b> African- Americans, Africans from Senegal, and Australian Aborigines. Correlations of pooled IGV values with certain subject characteristics were evaluated in the <b>US</b> <b>Whites.</b> Pooled IGV data were compared in subjects across the 4 ethnic groups. In <b>US</b> <b>Whites,</b> mean IGV and its variance were greater with higher age, lower nephron number, lower birth weight, and with gross obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular death. In comparisons by ethnic group, mean IGV and IGV ranges were higher in African-Americans and Australian Aborigines than in <b>US</b> <b>Whites</b> and African Senegalese subjects. We conclude that glomerular enlargement with volume heterogeneity marks more advanced age, relative nephron deficiency, lower birth weight, obesity, hypertension, and advanced cardiovascular disease. The findings in African-Americans and Australian Aborigines suggest that larger IGVs and volume heterogeneity might mark populations with accentuated susceptibility to hypertension and kidney disease, but the data need to be further examined {{in the context of}} the determining characteristics defined in the <b>US</b> <b>Whites.</b> No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundWe have {{previously}} demonstrated, using a regional California Cancer Registry database, that Asian ethnicity {{is an independent}} favorable prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). MethodsRetrospective population-based analysis of Korean and <b>US</b> <b>white</b> patients with NSCLC with known smoking status from Samsung Cancer Center, Seoul, South Korea, and a Southern California Regional Cancer Registry between 1998 and 2005 with follow-up through February 2008 to allow for even case ascertainment periods before and after 2002, when epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors were introduced in Korea and considered as the year of reference. ResultsA total of 4622 Korean and 8846 <b>US</b> <b>white</b> patients were analyzed. Median age of diagnosis was 63 years versus 71 years for Korean and white patients, respectively (P < 0. 0001). A total of 34. 5 % of Korean compared with 8. 2 % white patients were never-smokers. There was significant OS improvement in never-smokers when compared with ever-smokers among either Korean patients (p < 0. 0141) or <b>US</b> <b>white</b> (p < 0. 0397), respectively. There was significant improvement in OS among Korean patients from 2002 to 2005 compared with 1998 – 2001 (p < 0. 0001) but not among <b>US</b> <b>white</b> patients (p = 0. 5641). Except for stage II patients (p = 0. 0723), univariate analysis revealed Korean patients had improved OS compared with <b>US</b> <b>white</b> patients among stages I, III, and IV, respectively (all p < 0. 0001). Multivariate analysis revealed Korean ethnicity (versus white; hazard ratio (HR) = 0. 869; p < 0. 0001) was an independent favorable factor for OS. The adjusted HR for OS Korean ethnicity when compared with white ethnicity improved during 2002 – 2005 (HR = 0. 795; p < 0. 0001) compared with 1998 – 2001 (HR = 0. 889; p = 0. 0013). ConclusionsThese results suggest that Korean ethnicity compared with <b>US</b> <b>white</b> ethnicity is an independent favorable prognostic factor for OS in NSCLC. In addition, greater survival benefit among Korean patients with NSCLC was noted in the postepidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor era (2002 and after) compared with <b>US</b> <b>white</b> ethnicity...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} whether Asian American women {{with breast cancer}} have tumor characteristics associated with delayed detection of their disease. METHODS: Breast cancer size and stage were examined in relation to subjects' ethnic group and birthplace, {{on the basis of}} Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program data. RESULTS: Asian-born Asian American women with breast cancer had a greater proportion of tumors larger than 1 cm at diagnosis (79 %) than did <b>US</b> <b>White</b> women (70 %) (P <. 001). In contrast, the proportion of tumors larger than 1 cm among Asian American women born in the United States (67 %) did not differ significantly from that among <b>US</b> <b>White</b> women. CONCLUSIONS: Lower utilization of breast cancer screening by Asian-born Asian American women is probably responsible for their greater proportion of tumors larger than 1 cm relative to <b>US</b> <b>White</b> women in the study population. Interventional measures should be taken to increase the use of mammographic screening by first-generation Asian American women...|$|R
40|$|We {{analysed}} {{data obtained}} from the Hawaii Tumor Registry, a population-based participant in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) programme that monitors cancer incidence and mortality for the entire state. A total of 138 males and 116 females, {{under the age of}} 15, were diagnosed with leukaemia between 1960 and 1984, with average annual age-adjusted incidence rates of 49. 6 and 44. 8 per million, respectively. Time trend analysis by 5 -year calendar periods revealed an increasing rate for leukaemia among females only, whereas other populations have shown a positive trend in both sexes. The incidence rates for all ethnic groups combined were similar to those for <b>US</b> <b>whites.</b> Japanese and Chinese males had a slightly higher rate for leukaemia than <b>US</b> <b>whites,</b> while Filipinos, Hawaiians and whites in Hawaii had relatively lower rates. Among females, incidence was higher among whites, Filipinos, Hawaiians and Chinese than among <b>US</b> <b>whites,</b> and lower among Japanese. Thus, there were notable sex differences in the ethnic distribution of this disease...|$|R
