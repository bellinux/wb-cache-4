5|$|A {{number of}} tests that can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> {{function}} of the thyroid, {{for the presence of}} diseases, and for {{the success or failure of}} treatment. Blood tests in general aim to measure thyroid function or determine the cause of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests including the measurement of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, as well as the measurement of TSH. They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).|$|E

The radar systems were completed in late 1966 with the fourth Dnestr at Balkhash being used for testing.

5|$|Humans are {{not alone}} in {{suffering}} from lead's effects; plants and animals are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies.

The defensive armament consisted of a MG 15 in the B- and C-Stand (B-Stand - an upper rear firing position, C-Stand — lower gun emplacement). The fuselage had two cameras along with six ejector tubes for flashlight cartridges. The F-1 would see service until replaced by the Do 17 P in 1938. Only one F-2 was ever built, it was designated D-ACZJ and was used by Zeiss-Jena Company as a factory aircraft.|$|E

5|$|After {{not being}} able to host the Games in 1944, Cortina d'Ampezzo was {{selected}} to organise the 1956 Winter Olympics. At the opening ceremonies the final torch bearer, Guido Caroli, entered the Olympic Stadium on ice skates. As he skated around the stadium his skate caught on a cable and he fell, nearly extinguishing the flame. He was able to recover and light the cauldron. These were the first Winter Games to be televised, and the first Olympics ever broadcast to an international audience, though no television rights were sold until the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. The Cortina Games were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> feasibility of televising large sporting events. The Soviet Union made its Olympic debut and had an immediate impact, winning more medals than any other nation. Chiharu Igaya won the first Winter Olympics medal for Japan and the continent of Asia when he placed second in the slalom.|$|E
5|$|Horse meat {{has been}} used as food for humans and {{carnivorous}} animals throughout the ages. It is eaten {{in many parts of the}} world, though consumption is taboo in some cultures, and a subject of political controversy in others. Horsehide leather {{has been used}} for boots, gloves, jackets, baseballs, and baseball gloves. Horse hooves can also be used to produce animal glue. Horse bones can be used to make implements. Specifically, in Italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a spinto, which is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> readiness of a (pig) ham as it cures.

5|$|In April 1975, {{a single}} Jaguar was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's rough {{airstrip}} capacity, by landing and taking off multiple times from the M55 motorway, the final test flight {{was conducted with}} a full weapons load; the ability was never used in service but was considered useful as improvised runways {{might be the only}} runways left available in a large scale European conflict. In a high intensity European war, the role of the Jaguar was to support land forces on the Continent in resisting a Soviet assault on Western Europe, striking targets beyond the forward edge of the battlefield should a conflict escalate. The apparent mismatch between aircraft numbers and nuclear bombs was a consequence of RAF staff planners concluding that there would be one third attrition of Jaguars in an early conventional phase, leaving the survivors numerically strong enough to deliver the entire allocated stockpile of 56 nuclear bombs.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-6 {{was named}} for the Kepler Mission, a NASA and {{accomplishment}} project launched in 2009 that aims to discover Earth-like planets that transit, or cross in front of, their home stars with respect to Earth.

The discovery of Kepler-6b was announced by the Kepler team on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society along with planets around Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8. It was the third planet to be discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets to be verified by data from Kepler had been previously discovered.

5|$|On {{this section}} of the line, there is Communications-based train control (CBTC) {{equipment}} on the southbound express track between Fourth Avenue and Church Avenue, as part of the automation of the New York City Subway. The total cost is $99.6 million, with $15 million coming from the 2005–2009 capital budget (phase one) and $84.6 million from the 2010–2014 capital budget (phase two). The installation is a joint venture between Siemens and Thales Group, and is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> track's new signaling on R143s and R160s that are already equipped with CBTC. The estimated completion date was scheduled for March 2015; the installation is expected to be permanent. If Culver Line express service is implemented in 2017 as it was proposed, the express service would not initially use CBTC, and testing of CBTC on the express track will be limited to off-peak hours. The local tracks in this section would also get CBTC as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program.|$|E
5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from {{three months to}} two years were shown Sesame Street clips {{and a group of}} computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E

By the end of 1919, the 3rd BS had been disbanded and the sisters had been transferred to the Reserve Fleet at Portland, although Monarch was transferred to Portsmouth in early 1920. Monarch and Thunderer were temporarily recommissioned {{during the summer of}} 1920 to ferry troops to the Mediterranean and back. Orion joined Monarch at Portsmouth later in the year and became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet. Conqueror followed Orion to Portsmouth and relieved her as flagship in mid-1921 and the latter ship was again temporarily recommissioned to transport troops. Thunderer was converted into a training ship for naval cadets in 1921 and Orion became a gunnery training ship after being relieved. In accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, Orion and Conqueror were sold for scrap in 1922 and broken up the following year; Monarch was initially listed for sale, but was hulked instead. In 1923, she was converted into a target ship and was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> effects of bombs and shells, until she was sunk in early 1925. Thunderer was the last surviving ship and was sold in late 1926.
