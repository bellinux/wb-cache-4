5|$|Given these {{properties}} of DNA damage and mutation, {{it can be}} seen that DNA damage is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where <b>unrepaired</b> <b>damage</b> will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, unrepaired DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.|$|E

A relationship between the Y family polymerases and the Pol� pathway is thus implicated, and conforms to the two-polymerase two-step model of lesion bypass.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:The FA/BRCA pathway repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks. Mutations in this pathway cause Fanconi anemia (FA), a {{chromosome}} instability syndrome with bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. Upon DNA damage, normal and FA cells inhibit the cell cycle progression, until the G 2 /M checkpoint is {{turned off by the}} checkpoint recovery, which becomes activated when the DNA damage has been repaired. Interestingly, highly damaged FA cells seem to override the G 2 /M checkpoint. In this study we explored with a Boolean network model and key experiments whether checkpoint recovery activation occurs in FA cells with extensive <b>unrepaired</b> DNA <b>damage.</b> METHODS:We performed synchronous/asynchronous simulations of the FA/BRCA pathway Boolean network model. FA-A and normal lymphoblastoid cell lines were used to study checkpoint and checkpoint recovery activation after DNA damage induction. The experimental approach included flow cytometry cell cycle analysis, cell division tracking, chromosome aberration analysis and gene expression analysis through qRT-PCR and western blot. RESULTS:Computational simulations suggested that in FA mutants checkpoint recovery activity inhibits the checkpoint components despite <b>unrepaired</b> DNA <b>damage,</b> a behavior that we did not observed in wild-type simulations. This result implies that FA cells would eventually reenter the cell cycle after a DNA damage induced G 2 /M checkpoint arrest, but before the damage has been fixed. We observed that FA-A cells activate the G 2 /M checkpoint and arrest in G 2 phase, but eventually reach mitosis and divide with <b>unrepaired</b> DNA <b>damage,</b> thus resolving the initial checkpoint arrest. Based on our model result we look for ectopic activity of checkpoint recovery components. We found that checkpoint recovery components, such as PLK 1, are expressed to a similar extent as normal undamaged cells do, even though FA-A cells harbor highly damaged DNA. CONCLUSIONS:Our results show that FA cells, despite extensive DNA damage, do not loss the capacity to express the transcriptional and protein components of checkpoint recovery that might eventually allow their division with <b>unrepaired</b> DNA <b>damage.</b> This might allow cell survival but increases the genomic instability inherent to FA individuals and promotes cancer...|$|R

The Apnl protein is a homolog ofEscherichia coli endonuclease IV, which {{functions in the}} repair ofsome oxidative and alkylation damages in that organism. We show here that yeast strains lacking Apnl (generated by targeted gene disruption or deletion-replacement) are hypersensitive to both oxidative (hydrogen peroxide and t-butylhydroperoxide) and alkylating (methyl- and ethylmethane sulfonate) agents that damage DNA. These cellular hypersensitivities are correlated with the accumulation of <b>unrepaired</b> <b>damages</b> in the chromosomal DNA of apnl mutant yeast cells. Hydrogen peroxide-treated APNI+ but not apnl mutant cells regenerate high-molecular-weight DNA efficiently after the treatment.

An analogous result with DNA from methylmethane sulfonate-treated cells corresponded to the accumulation of unrepaired DNA apurinic sites in the apnl mutant cells. The rate of spontaneous mutation in apnl mutant S. cerevisiae was 6 - to 12 -fold higher than that measured for wild-type yeast cells.
