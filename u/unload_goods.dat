Even after reconstruction, much of the town's importance to river commerce ended in 1873 with completion of the Willamette Falls Locks. Ships no longer needed to dock and <b>unload</b> <b>goods</b> and passengers for portage around the falls. The remaining town officially survived until 1929, when it was annexed to Oregon City.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th {{century the}} area went into decline as {{congestion}} and containerization forced shipping to <b>unload</b> <b>goods</b> further east, {{and the last}} warehouses closed in 1972.|$|E
500|$|The town of Milford {{was founded}} in 1793, after Sir William Hamilton {{obtained}} an Act of Parliament in 1790 to establish the port at Milford, and {{takes its name from}} the natural harbour of Milford Haven, which was used for several hundred years as a staging point on sea journeys to Ireland and as a shelter by Vikings. It was known as a safe port and is mentioned in Shakespeare's Cymbeline as [...] "blessed Milford". It was used as the base for several military operations, such as Richard de Clare's invasion of Leinster in 1167, Henry II's Invasion of Ireland in 1171, and Oliver Cromwell's 1649 invasion of Ireland; while forces which have disembarked at the point include Jean II de Rieux's 1405 reinforcement of the Glyndŵr Rising and Henry VII's 1485 landing at the waterway before marching on England. By the late 18th century the two local creeks were being used to load and <b>unload</b> <b>goods,</b> [...] and surrounding settlements were established, including the medieval chapel, and Summer Hill Farm, the only man-made structures on the future site of Milford.|$|E

2500|$|Several ports {{were built}} at regular {{intervals}} along {{the route of the}} canal in order to load and <b>unload</b> <b>goods</b> and also to provide stopping-places for travellers. Toulouse has two ports: the port de l'Embouchure is located at the junction of the Canal du Midi, the Canal de Brienne, and the Lateral canal of the Garonne while Port Saint-Sauveur is located in the centre of town near the Hall of Grains. There were two other ports [...] in Toulouse but they were destroyed for urban development. So the Port des Minimes and the Port Saint-Etienne were replaced by towpaths.|$|E

50|$|The pier is {{used for}} loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>goods</b> and {{berthing}} of kaitos operating between Sha Tau Kwok and Kat O, Sam A and other northeast rural areas. The original pier {{was built in the}} 1960s, but was replaced by a new one in 2007.|$|R
25|$|Conditions for Witnesses {{improved}} in 1942, {{when they were}} increasingly given work details that required little supervision, such as farming, gardening, transportation and <b>unloading</b> <b>goods,</b> while others worked in civilian clothing in a health resort, as housekeepers for Nazi officials or were given construction and craft tasks at military buildings.|$|R
5000|$|A {{large wooden}} {{platform}} known as 'McKenzie's Landing' was constructed and at high tide, boats would <b>unload</b> <b>goods</b> {{onto the platform}} and at low tides horse and cart {{would be used to}} collect the items. The same would be done to load boats.|$|E
50|$|The railmotor fleet was {{reported}} as giving good results and accomplishing {{the objects of}} economical working and speedier and more comfortable travel compared to steam train services, since mixed trains on branch lines usually resulted in slower passenger service {{as a result of}} frequent stops to load or <b>unload</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the route}} was served by mixed sets, i.e. goods and {{passengers}} {{used the same}} trains. This could substantially increases the travel time as {{the time needed to}} load and <b>unload</b> <b>goods</b> substantially exceeded the time needed for passengers to get on and off the train. After a few years separate sets began to be used.|$|E
50|$|The Palestinian {{side of the}} {{crossing}} is operated by two families who were granted a franchise by the Palestinian Authority and authorized by Hamas. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry in Ramallah coordinates activity with Israel. The two sides are 400 meters apart, separated by a drop-off zone for <b>unloading</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|R

The harbor and ships can be seen to the right...|$|R
50|$|Warehouses allow {{transport}} optimization {{along the}} supply chain, and allow companies {{to work with}} an optimal inventory (economic order quantity) regarding service quality. For example, at the terminal point of a transport system {{it is necessary to}} stockpile produce until a full load can be transported. Warehouses {{can also be used to}} store the <b>unloaded</b> <b>goods</b> from the vessel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{street was}} {{originally}} {{the site of}} a dock, Børsgraven, which was created in connection with the construction of Børsen {{in the beginning of the}} 17th century. It made it possible for ships to <b>unload</b> <b>goods</b> close to the new market building. The street that ran along the north side of the dock was called Bag Børsen ("Behind Børsen").|$|E
5000|$|Belcher Bay (Chinese: 卑路乍灣) is a bay at Kennedy Town on the {{northwest}} shore of Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong. It is east of Sulphur Channel. The bay is named after Edward Belcher, who surveyed the surrounding water and land in the Victoria Harbour in 1841. It is currently used as a site for ships to load and <b>unload</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E
50|$|Kalmar Terminal was {{a vehicle}} {{intended}} {{to be used for}} transporting goods in ports between ships and railway. One odd detail was that the door was located in the front. It had a V8 diesel engine, automatic gearbox, and semi-trailer coupling with built-in automatic air and electric connections. At the rear a forklift was mounted, so the truckdriver could load and <b>unload</b> <b>goods</b> from the trailer.|$|E

5000|$|Nevertheless, two {{commercial}} river services {{operated in}} the early 20th Century from the site. In 1903 William Collins & Son used a wharf next to the remains of Harris's wharf. Collins operated a number of vessels between Brisbane and Ipswich including the Mary, Eucalypta, Essex, Myora and Advance. A [...] "stiff legged" [...] timber crane was used to <b>unload</b> <b>goods</b> at the wharf. Increasingly unable to compete with road transport, Collins ceased the river service cira 1927.|$|E
50|$|They {{usually have}} loading docks to load and <b>unload</b> <b>goods</b> from trucks. Sometimes {{warehouses}} {{are designed for}} the loading and unloading of goods directly from railways, airports, or seaports. They often have cranes and forklifts for moving goods, which are usually placed on ISO standard pallets loaded into pallet racks. Stored goods can include any raw materials, packing materials, spare parts, components, or finished goods associated with agriculture, manufacturing and production. In Indian English a warehouse may {{be referred to as}} a godown.|$|E

50|$|The European {{settlement}} of Stradbroke Island began in 1827 when a convict out-station was established at Dunwich {{to serve the}} Moreton Bay convict settlement based at Brisbane town. During 1827-28 a warehouse and accommodation for convict labourers, boatmen and soldiers were constructed. However, this settlement at Dunwich was short lived as problems with <b>unloading</b> <b>goods</b> in poor weather, smuggling, and hostile Aborigines, resulted in {{the closure of the}} out-station in 1831.|$|R
50|$|A double yellow line {{means no}} stopping. This means that <b>unloading</b> of <b>goods</b> and {{alighting}} of passengers is not permitted.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} at Bromley, Kent and left school {{at an early age}} to become a {{merchant}} seaman, and later captained ships on the East Indian and West Indian trade routes. His involvement with the South Australian Company began when David McLaren, manager of the South Australian Company, controversially contracted him to transport goods for the Company from Singapore to Port Adelaide in the [...] "Guiana", becoming, on 7 October 1840, the first to <b>unload</b> <b>goods</b> at the new wharf.|$|E
50|$|Older {{forms of}} {{transport}} did not disappear {{with the arrival}} of steam. The businesses and animals used previously to transport goods between regions found new work in moving goods to and from trunk lines. The Aegean areas alone had over 10,000 camels working to supply local rail-roads. Ankara station had a thousand camels at a time waiting to <b>unload</b> <b>goods.</b> Furthermore, additional territories traversed by rail-roads encouraged development and improved agriculture. Like sailing vessels, land transport contributed to and invigorated trade and commerce across the empire.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the town is the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad which {{constructed}} its main line through Eastern Utah in 1883. However {{the only thing that}} existed at this location was the rail siding, called Crescent for the crescent-shaped formation of the Book Cliffs in the area. A town formed approximately 5 mi east at the next rail siding, Thompson Springs. Thompson became a transfer point to <b>unload</b> <b>goods</b> from the train for shipment to other cities in the region without rail access.|$|E
50|$|The island {{served as}} a major trading depot, <b>unloading</b> <b>goods</b> from Saint-Domingue (Haiti), Mexico, Cuba and France, and {{collecting}} furs in a short-lived fur trade. Mobile Bay itself, before a channel was dredged, was too shallow, and its sand bars too shifting and treacherous, for ocean-going vessels to travel up the bay and Mobile River to Fort Louis de La Louisiane. So, smaller boats carried cargo within Mobile Bay to and from Dauphin Island.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{release in}} 1942, Henry joined the Australian Army, {{in which he}} served until 1946, loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>goods</b> trains at the New South Wales / Queensland border, where he {{established}} a close personal friendship with fellow German refugee Helmut Newton. After the War Henry refreshed his studies of graphic design at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Henry then visited his parents in Cochabamba, Bolivia, practicing art and reviving his pre-war interest in photography, winning a local photography prize.|$|R
