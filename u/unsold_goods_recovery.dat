40|$|This paper {{considers}} the pricing decision faced by {{a producer of}} a commodity with a short shelf or demand life. A hierarchical model is developed, {{and the results of}} the single period inventory model are used to examine possible pricing and return policies. The paper shows that several such policies currently in effect are suboptimal. These include those where the manufacturer offers retailers full credit for all <b>unsold</b> <b>goods</b> or where no returns of <b>unsold</b> <b>goods</b> are permitted. The paper also demonstrates that a policy whereby a manufacturer offers retailers full credit for a partial return of goods may achieve channel coordination, but that the optimal return allowance will be a function of retailer demand. Therefore, such a policy cannot be optimal in a multi-retailer environment. It is proven, however, that a pricing and return policy in which a manufacturer offers retailers a partial credit for all <b>unsold</b> <b>goods</b> can achieve channel coordination in a multi-retailer environment. distribution, coordination, channel, newsboy problem, pricing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{purpose of}} this paper is to prove methods of {{redistribution}} management on the model of <b>unsold</b> <b>goods.</b> A research was carried out with data sourced from the aftermarket sector. The research was used to explore basic questions of what are the benefits of <b>unsold</b> <b>goods</b> redistribution and how it should effectively contribute to inventory management. The existing information models have focused on forward distribution flows â€“ from suppliers to consumers. The current information systems are generally in-depth specialized in forecasting methods of future consumption while they do not deal with returnable asset control. The paper provides a comprehensive description of the redistribution principles tested on the compiled model. The basic prerequisite that needs to be fulfilled in order to reach results, is sharing information between suppliers and consumers. For application of this method a shared information platform within the supply chain is required. The expected outcomes of the proposed model are reduced inventory levels and improved structure of the portfolio resulting in higher profits. The redistribution was conducted with the aim of accelerating inventory turnover and minimizing redundant purchasing. Furthermore, a correlation between <b>unsold</b> <b>goods</b> redistribution and higher load vehicle factor was identified...|$|R

The liquidator has knowledge and experience with pricing items, and general value knowledge of all types of household goods and personal property value, and the specialist's experience in disposing of <b>unsold</b> <b>goods</b> in an unsentimental manner after the sale. These professionals often take a percentage of the net proceeds, anywhere from 25% to 50%.|$|R
50|$|This pile-up of <b>unsold</b> <b>goods</b> and {{materials}} encourages businesses to decrease both production and employment. This in turn lowers people's incomes - and saving, causing a leftward {{shift in the}} S line in the diagram (step B).

Instead of interest-rate adjustment solving the problem, a recession does so. Thus in the diagram, the interest-rate change is small.|$|R
5000|$|Channel {{stuffing}} has {{a number}} of long-term consequences for a company. Firstly, distributors will often return any <b>unsold</b> <b>goods</b> to the company, incurring a carrying cost and also developing a backlog of product inventory. Wildly fluctuating demand, combined with this excess inventory, leads to costly overtimes and factory shutdowns. Even mild channel stuffing can spiral out of control as sales works to make up for prior over-selling. Discounts used to drive trade loading can greatly affect profits, and even help establish gray market channels as salesmen no longer adequately qualify their prospects.|$|R

If all the dealer's {{capital is}} {{employed}} {{in his own}} trade, and {{no part of it}} locked up as <b>unsold</b> <b>goods,</b> the new demand affords him additional encouragement to save, by enabling his savings to yield him not merely interest, but profit; and if he does not choose to save (or until he shall have saved), it enables him to carry on an additional business with borrowed capital, and so gain the difference between interest and profit, or, in other words, to receive wages of superintendance on a larger amount of capital.|$|R

The lost profits can be measured as the contract price minus the costs not yet incurred minus the seller's value of the <b>unsold</b> <b>goods</b> {{at the time of}} breach. If the buyer prefers to resell the goods in the market despite the resale cost, the monopolistic seller will prefer to breach and pay lost profits damages. The law tends to provide the remedies that would be included in efficient contracts. ...|$|R

The results show that when the retailer is risk averse, the supply chain system is able to achieve coordination.

Price-only contracts and buyback contracts are the two types considered in the survey. In price-only contract the manufacturer produces the product and sells it to retailer who inturn sells it to the customer. In case of buyback contracts the retailer has the facility to return the <b>unsold</b> <b>goods</b> to the manufacturer for a partial refund. The survey deals with the link between actual demand and optimal order quantity and reflects to the incentive problem that maybeset information sharing in supply chains. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

This second proposition, however, must be taken with some limitations and explanations.

60|$|Now it {{is obvious}} that the sojourners, on their arrival, confer the benefit in {{question}} upon some dealers, who did not enjoy it before. They purchase their food, and many other articles, from the dealers in the place.

They encourage them to save, and enable them to receive wages of superintendance upon a larger amount of capital. These effects being undeniable, the question is, whether the presence of the sojourners deprives any others of the Paris dealers of a similar advantage.|$|R

40|$|Manufacturers facing {{uncertain}} demand {{may induce}} distributors to carry ample stocks {{of their products}} by agreeing to accept returns of <b>unsold</b> <b>goods</b> for credit. The authors model the manufacturer's decision to accept returns, showing that this decision depends crucially {{on the nature of}} the demand uncertainty. Uncertainty over customer arrivals favors returns, while uncertainty over consumers' valuation of the manufacturer's product leads distributors to set retail prices too high (from the manufacturer's standpoint) when returns are allowed. The authors show that returns can be expected to raise retail prices, while maintaining shrinking distributor margins.

40|$|Abstract: In {{a general}} auction model with {{affiliated}} signals, common components to valuations and endogenous entry, we compute the equilibrium bidding strategies and outcomes, and derive a lower bound on the optimal reserve price. This lower bound can be computed using data on past auction combined {{with information about}} the subsequent sales prices of <b>unsold</b> <b>goods.</b> We compute the lower bound using data from FDIC real estate auctions. We find the point estimate for an upper bound on the optimal reserve for real estate to be 75 % of appraised value. Using data from private real estate auctions, we show that when reserve prices are around 50 % of appraised value, seller revenues are increasing in the reserve price...|$|R
