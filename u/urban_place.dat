40|$|Walking is {{a mode of}} {{engaging}} and experiencing places. Through habitual walking and wandering one does not just move through physical space but actively takes part and contributes to {{the social and cultural}} dynamics of a place. On foot, the body participates in place’s temporal patterns of activity and it is an agent in processes of repetitive change in <b>urban</b> <b>places.</b> Rhythms of body and city merge through the experience of walking. Walking is in itself a spatial and social rhythm, and through walking one perceives and lives <b>urban</b> <b>places</b> as a constellation of spatial, social, cultural, natural and other sensory rhythms – urban rhythms. Urban rhythms are everywhere in human activity and life in <b>urban</b> <b>places.</b> They take concrete forms, interact and mingle adjusting to each other, and together they characterise everyday social-spatial environment. These are recurrent and cyclical repetitions in the form of activities, events, sequences of objects, patterns or shadows, to name just a few, which one perceives and experiences, and with which one interacts in <b>urban</b> <b>places.</b> <b>Urban</b> rhythms embody time and are place specific. Consequently, they nurture senses of time, characterising temporally <b>urban</b> <b>places,</b> and senses of place, part of place’s everyday representatio...|$|R

500|$|In 1807, Robert Fulton {{initiated}} a steamboat line from New York to Albany, {{the first successful}} enterprise of its kind. By 1810, with 10,763 people, Albany was the 10th-largest <b>urban</b> <b>place</b> in the nation. The town and village were known as [...] "the Colonie" [...] {{to the north of}} Albany was annexed in 1815. In 1825 the Erie Canal was completed, forming a continuous water route from the Great Lakes to New York City. Unlike the current Barge Canal, which ends at nearby Waterford, the original Erie Canal ended at Albany; Lock 1 was north of Colonie Street. The Canal emptied into a [...] man-made lagoon called the Albany Basin, which was Albany's main port from 1825 until the Port of Albany-Rensselaer opened in 1932. In 1829, while working as a professor at the Albany Academy, Joseph Henry, widely regarded as [...] "the foremost American scientist of the 19th century", built the first electric motor. Three years later, he discovered electromagnetic self-induction (the SI unit for which is now the henry). He went on to be the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. In the 1830 and 1840 censuses, Albany was ranked as the 9th-largest <b>urban</b> <b>place</b> in the nation, then back to 10th in 1850. This was the last time the city was one of the top ten largest urban places in the nation.|$|E
500|$|Commerce Square {{was praised}} for its design of two towers {{surrounding}} a plaza. The Philadelphia Inquirer said [...] "Its most positive aspect {{is that it}} avoids the developers' cliches of atriums and shopping malls and makes a real <b>urban</b> <b>place.</b> It expresses great confidence in Philadelphia, and even more important, in {{the whole idea of}} living in cities." [...] Renowned Philadelphia urban planner Edmund N. Bacon praised Commerce Square and its plaza by saying [...] " [...] sensitivity for urban design is beautifully demonstrated by his design for the lobby level, including the splendid garden, of Commerce Square at 20th and Market streets, which I think will prove {{to be one of the}} finest commercial projects to be built in this century." ...|$|E

DeCarli Square has become a popular <b>urban</b> <b>place</b> hosting music, art and religious events, festivals, farmers' markets, and social gatherings.|$|E

40|$|Notwithstanding the {{importance}} of retailing to urban economies, the role of retailing in the marketing of <b>urban</b> <b>places</b> has been an area neglected by both academics and practitioners alike. It is acknowledged that the principles of marketing can be applied (albeit with modification) to the context of <b>urban</b> <b>places.</b> The theoretical implications of this are considered using Corsico's (1993) metaphors {{of the city as}} enterprise, market and commodity. Such issues are considered via a survey of place marketing actors within the specific context of the marketing of towns and cities as shopping destinations in <b>urban</b> <b>places</b> classified as sub-regional and above. Particular attention is paid to responsibility for the marketing of the retail provision, the emphasis given to retail in the marketing/promotional activities of various urban stakeholders, the perceived role of retailing, and the factors influencing the nature of the urban retail provision. Promotion of retailing was found to be important for all urban stakeholders {{to a greater or lesser}} degree. However, prime responsibility lay with town centre managers and shopping centre managers. The implications for both theory and practice are discussed...|$|R
30|$|A name cannot {{change the}} city and our {{relationship}} with places. However, new terms for now-nameless spaces will help to change people’s perception and their capability of seeing what they have never seen before. The geographer’s taxonomic effort to re-designate <b>urban</b> <b>places</b> and typologies involves a political and ideological content. Most urban spaces are unmanageable because they fit neither with current technology nor with the social organization. Urban design requires new interpretations of and ideas about the awareness and form of settlements. Elaborating on what we learnt {{in the past is}} no longer enough to kindle creativeness and innovation. In the tradition of classic geography, I call for a new classification of <b>urban</b> <b>places,</b> which is meant to find names for places we do not “see” and therefore we cannot catalogue. A new classification of human settlements is a step forward on a new path to perceive, define and eventually plan them. A new perception of metropolitan areas leads to a different relation between area and administration; hence between <b>urban</b> <b>places</b> and representation of citizens.|$|R

40|$|While {{homelessness}} {{exists in}} all places, {{a majority of}} people experiencing homelessness are experiencing it in urban areas. Approximately 77 percent of the U. S. homeless population in 2007 was counted in <b>places</b> considered completely <b>urban,</b> and over 60 percent of the homeless population was living in metropolitan areas of greater than 1, 000, 000 people. Because of this heavy urban bias, trends in homelessness nationally largely reflect trends in urban homelessness. However, closer examination of urban homelessness reveals interesting variation among <b>urban</b> <b>places,</b> particularly when comparing major cities to other urban areas. Between 2005 and 2007 homelessness in major cities increased by 4 percent, while homelessness in other urban areas (smaller cities, suburbs, etc.) {{as well as the}} rest of the country decreased by approximately 10 percent. Major cities also have rates of homelessness that are much higher than other <b>urban</b> <b>places.</b> In 2007, major cities had a rate of 43 people per 10, 000 compared with 29 people per 10, 000 for all <b>urban</b> <b>places</b> and 22 people per 10, 000 nationally...|$|R
