40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} concept of equal <b>uniformities</b> on locally compact topological groups. In Section 1 we collect some {{classical}} characterizations for T 0 groups and metric groups, along with some new ones. In Section 2 and 3 we find characterizations for the locally compact metric case and the σ-compact case. The Gδ condition is introduced in Section 3 and plays a crucial part in the characterizations obtained for the locally compact case. Section 4 contains a brief survey of inductive limit systems and includes a reinterpretation of a famous theorem of Kakutani and Kodaira, together with some slight generalizations and consequences. Section 5 contains structure theorems for locally compact groups with equal <b>uniformities</b> using Lie group approximation methods. These results generalize a theorem of Grosser and Moskowitz and answer a question posed by G. Itzkowitz. It is shown that if every open σ-compact subgroup of a locally compact group G has equal <b>uniformities</b> then so does G. The structure theorems yield a number of interesting characterizations of equal <b>uniformities</b> and include the characterization that every real valued left uniformly continuous function on G is right uniformly continuous. Section 6 contains an independent characterization for totally disconnected locally compact groups which motivated the method of proof used in the general case...|$|R

60|$|The {{general remarks}} on causation, which seemed {{necessary}} as {{an introduction to}} the theory of the inductive process, may here terminate. That process is essentially an inquiry into cases of causation. All the <b>uniformities</b> which exist in the succession of phenomena, and most of the <b>uniformities</b> in their co-existence, are either, as we have seen, themselves laws of causation, or consequences resulting from, and corollaries capable of being deduced from, such laws. If we could determine what causes are correctly assigned to what effects, and what effects to what causes, we should be virtually acquainted with the whole course of nature. All those <b>uniformities</b> which are mere results of causation might then be explained and accounted for; and every individual fact or event might be predicted, provided we had the requisite data, that is, the requisite knowledge of the circumstances which, in the particular instance, preceded it.|$|R
