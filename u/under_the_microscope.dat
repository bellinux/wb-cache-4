5|$|The {{possible}} {{existence of}} unseen microbial life was suspected from ancient times, {{such as in}} Jain scriptures from 6th century BC India, and the 1st century BC book On Agriculture by Marcus Terentius Varro. Microbiology, {{the scientific study of}} microorganisms, began with their observation <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>microscope</b> in the 1670s by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. In the 1850s, Louis Pasteur found that microorganisms caused food spoilage, debunking the theory of spontaneous generation. In the 1880s Robert Koch discovered that microorganisms caused the diseases tuberculosis, cholera, and anthrax.|$|E
5|$|A {{reduction}} in fracture toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>microscope.</b> These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E
40|$|Jejunal biopsy {{specimens}} {{were obtained}} {{by means of the}} Crosby capsule from a normal person and from seven patients. Of these, three with primary malabsorptive disease (idiopathic steatorrhoea) had an abnormal mucosal pattern <b>under</b> <b>the</b> light <b>microscope,</b> and <b>the</b> microvilli <b>under</b> <b>the</b> electron <b>microscope</b> were stunted, broadened, and sparse. Two with primary malabsorptive disease had normal light microscopic appearances, and the microvilli appeared normal, while two who had appearances typical of primary malabsorptive disease <b>under</b> <b>the</b> light <b>microscope</b> had malignant disease of the small intestine. Of the patients with malignant disease, one had normal microvilli <b>under</b> <b>the</b> electron <b>microscope</b> and <b>the</b> other demonstrated microvilli similar to those found in primary malabsorptive disease. The former patient may have had primary malabsorptive disease in addition to the malignant change but this is uncertain, {{and there is no reason}} to believe that this was the case in the latter patient. <b>The</b> changes seen <b>under</b> <b>the</b> light <b>microscope</b> are usually of great value as an aid to diagnosis in primary malabsorptive disease but this is not always the case, and the same applies to electron microscope changes...|$|R

5|$|The {{spore print}} is purplish brown. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>microscope,</b> the spores appear dull purple-brown. They are {{ellipsoid}} to somewhat egg-shaped, and, according to Singer's original description, measure 8–10 by 4–5μm. A later study of specimens collected from British Columbia, Canada, instead reported a larger spore size range of 10–13 by 6–7μm. The spores have an apical germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 22–35 by 7–10μm. There are abundant cystidia that form a sterile band {{on the edges}} of the gills (cheilocystidia); these cystidia are smooth, inflated, and fusoid-ventricose (enlarged in the middle and tapered toward both ends) with an sharp tip, and measure 25–30 by 6–9μm. The cap cuticle (an ixocutis) is made of a layer of roughly horizontal, gelatinized, wavy, hyaline hyphae that are 0.8–5.5μm in diameter.|$|E

50|$|Oral ecology {{refers to}} the organisms that live in a mouth. Bacteria in biofilm were first {{detected}} <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>microscopes</b> of Antony van Leeuwenhoek in the 17th century. Various bacteria and saliva {{are two of the}} major components in oral microbiology, having the capability to be harmful, but also performing beneficial and necessary roles in the immune system. Proper oral hygiene aims to control the harmful effects and prevent disease transmission.|$|R
40|$|Of 14 {{cases of}} {{clinically}} and biochemically confirmed idiopathic steatorrhoea, 11 showed mucosal abnormalities when biopsy specimens {{from the upper}} small intestine were examined <b>under</b> <b>the</b> dissecting, the light, and <b>the</b> electron <b>microscope.</b> In <b>the</b> three remaining cases mucosal changes could be detected only <b>under</b> <b>the</b> electron <b>microscope.</b> <b>The</b> simple and inexpensive dissecting microscope can therefore be accepted as an efficient instrument for routine use in the diagnosis of idiopathic steatorrhoea and for the screening of cases which might merit further examination <b>under</b> <b>the</b> electron <b>microscope.</b> <b>The</b> light <b>microscope</b> allows <b>the</b> heights of the villi {{and the depth of}} the glandular layer to be measured and the limits of normality to be defined on a quantitative basis...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the oocytes of the earthworm, Pheretima posthuma, {{examined}} fresh <b>under</b> <b>the</b> phase-contrast and interference microscopes {{as well as by}} histochemical techniques, has revealed that {{there are two types of}} lipid bodies in the cytoplasm. The lipid bodies of the first type (Lj) are smaller, appear as homogeneous, dark granules <b>under</b> <b>the</b> phase-contrast <b>microscope,</b> and have a protein-phospholipid core surrounded by a thick sheath of phospholipids only. The lipid bodies of the second category (Z>g), which arise as a result of growth and chemical change in L ^ bodies, have a pure phospholipid core surrounded by a thick triglyceride sheath. They give a ringed appearance <b>under</b> <b>the</b> phase-contrast <b>microscope.</b> <b>The</b> study <b>under</b> <b>the</b> interference <b>microscope</b> shows that this ringed appearance is an optical artifact. The lipid spheres present in the follicular epithelium contain phospholipids only. The mitochondria are in the form of minute granules. They remain unchanged throughout oogenesis. Some vacuoles devoid of any lipids, proteins, or carbohydrates have been observed. They also remain unchanged. Pure triglyceride spheres, yolk globules, nucleolar extrusions, as well as cholesterols and cholesteryl esters are absent...|$|R

25|$|Undifferentiated cancers - {{those where}} the cell type cannot be {{determined}} - {{make up about}} 10% of epithelial ovarian cancers and have a comparatively poor prognosis. When examined <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>microscope,</b> these tumors have very abnormal cells that are arranged in clumps or sheets. Usually there are recognizable clumps of serous cells inside the tumor.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear actin exists {{mainly as}} a monomer, {{but can also}} form dynamic {{oligomers}} and short polymers. Nuclear actin organization varies in different cell types. For example, in Xenopus oocytes (with higher nuclear actin level in comparison to somatic cells) actin forms filaments, which stabilize nucleus architecture. These filaments can be observed <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>microscope</b> thanks to fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin staining.|$|E
25|$|Helminth eggs {{contained}} in wastewater, sewage sludge or human excreta {{are not always}} infectious, i.e. able to cause the disease helminthiasis. Fertilized eggs and unfertilized eggs can exist side by side. Unfertilized eggs are identifiable <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>microscope</b> by their elongated shape. No larvae can hatch from these kinds of eggs. Therefore, unfertilized eggs do not pose a danger to human health.|$|E

Under Gram staining, C. difficile cells are Gram-positive and show optimum growth on blood agar at human body {{temperatures in the}} absence of oxygen. When stressed, the bacteria produce spores that are able to tolerate extreme conditions that the active bacteria cannot tolerate.|$|E
25|$|Hungerford, a pre{{doctoral}} fellow, {{was writing}} his doctoral thesis on chromosomes in a genetics lab at , and detected a tiny flaw in chromosomes {{from the blood}} cells of patients with a type of leukemia. It was the first genetic defect linked with a specific human cancer. Nowell was a pathologist at the University of Pennsylvania, studying leukemia cells <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>microscope</b> when he noticed cells {{in the act of}} dividing. To his surprise, their chromosomes—usually an indistinct tangle—were visible as separate structures.|$|E
25|$|In biology {{methylene}} blue {{is used as}} a dye for a number of different staining procedures, such as Wright's stain and Jenner's stain. Since it is a temporary staining technique, {{methylene blue}} {{can also be used to}} examine RNA or DNA <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>microscope</b> or in a gel: as an example, a solution of methylene blue can be used to stain RNA on hybridization membranes in northern blotting to verify the amount of nucleic acid present. While methylene blue is not as sensitive as ethidium bromide, it is less toxic and it does not intercalate in nucleic acid chains, thus avoiding interference with nucleic acid retention on hybridization membranes or with the hybridization process itself.|$|E
