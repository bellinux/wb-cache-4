A peculiarity – the weak central spot in the focused {{image of a}}n apertured Bessel beam – has been recorded for the first time. Femtosecond-domain temporal evolution {{of the image of}} two types of superluminal localized wave packets – the so-called Bessel-X pulse and the focused X wave – is studied theoretically. For the Bessel-X pulse the aperture truncation leads to appearance of twin pulses in the image plane.

Operators were exposed to electromagnetic fields which rarely exceed the recommended limits of International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Only a measurement of electromagnetic fields near short wave diathermy equipment operating at a frequency of 27. 12 MHz exposed operators to levels above those recommended by ICNIRP {{at a distance of}} 1 metre.

40|$|Attosecond pulses {{allow the}} study of {{electrons}} on their natural timescale. They are created from the interaction of atoms with ultrashort, intense laser pulses whose electric field approaches the strength of inner-atomic electric fields. This thesis presents experiments around the generation, characterization and application of attosecond pulses. First, we study {{the influence of the}} atomic generation medium on the temporal properties of attosecond pulses. Their central photon energy can be controlled by using a two-color generation field and by thin-foil filtering techniques tailored to specific spectral bands. With these techniques, broadband attosecond pulses with durations down to 130 as have been measured. To characterize attosecond pulse trains at their birth, we introduce a new method that perturbs the generation laser field with its weak second harmonic. This allows us to assess the influence of the medium in the generation process. We then test the limits of a well-established pulse train characterization method with regard to probe intensity and demonstrate a way to circumvent these limitations. A second set of experiments uses attosecond pulses to excite atoms and molecules for the creation of <b>ultrashort</b> <b>wave</b> packets. Free electron wave packets can be controlled by an external laser field and driven to scatter off their parent ions. They also carry information on the atomic structure, which enables the phase-resolved characterization of unknown bound wave packets. Exposing molecules to attosecond pulses can trigger dissociation reactions that can be controlled by a delayed probe laser pulse. We present a study of different probe pulse properties and report the observation of attosecond electron dynamics inside a hydrogen molecule...|$|E

The diffraction properties {{for the case}} of an ultrashort pulsed finite beam with Gaussian profiles in both the time and spatial domains are investigated. The spectral bandwidth of the diffracted beam, the Bragg selectivity bandwidth and the diffraction efficiency of the volume grating are influenced by the geometry parameter and the input bandwidth.

40|$|Progress in ultrafast {{electron}} microscopy {{relies on the}} development of efficient laser-driven electron sources delivering femtosecond electron pulses to the sample. In particular, recent advances employ photoemission from metal nanotips as coherent point-like femtosecond low-energy electron sources. We report the nonlinear emission of <b>ultrashort</b> electron <b>wave</b> packets from a gold nanotip generated by nonlocal excitation and nanofocusing of surface plasmon polaritons. We verify the nanoscale localization of plasmon-induced electron emission by its electrostatic collimation characteristics. With a plasmon polariton pulse duration below 8 fs at the apex, we identify multiphoton photoemission as the underlying emission process. The quantum efficiency of the plasmon-induced emission exceeds that of photoemission from direct apex illumination. We demonstrate the application for plasmon-triggered point-projection imaging of an individual semiconductor nanowire at 3 μm tip-sample distance. Based on numerical simulations we estimate an electron pulse duration at the sample below 10 fs for tip-sample distances up to few micrometers. Plasmon-driven nanolocalized electron emission thus enables femtosecond point-projection microscopy with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution, femtosecond low-energy electron in-line holography, and opens a new route towards femtosecond scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy.

The rate {{of energy}} emission from a weakly excited wobbler is calculated. Then scattering of a wobbler by a localized inhomogeneity is considered {{and it is}} demonstrated {{that in the first}} approximation it results in the change ofthe wobbler’s velocity only if the wobbler was excited prior to the collision. The corresponding changes of velocity and ofthe internal oscillation amplitude are calculated.

40|$|In the {{emerging}} field of magnonics, spin waves are foreseen as signal carriers for future spintronic information processing and communication devices, owing {{to both the}} very low power losses and a high device miniaturisation potential predicted for short-wavelength spin waves. Yet, the controlled and efficient excitation of propagating nanoscale spin waves remains a challenge to be resolved. Here, we report the observation of high- amplitude, <b>ultrashort</b> dipole-exchange spin <b>waves</b> (down to 80 nm wavelength at 10 GHz frequency) in a ferromagnetic single layer system, coherently excited by the driven dynamics of a spin vortex core. We used time-resolved x-ray microscopy to directly image such propagating spin waves {{for a wide range}} of excitation frequencies. By further analysis, we found that these waves exhibit a heterosymmetric mode profile, involving regions with anti-Larmor precession sense and purely linear magnetic oscillation. In particular, this mode profile consists of dynamic vortices with laterally alternating helicity, leading to a partial magnetic flux closure over the film thickness, which is explained by a strong and unexpected mode hybridisation. The spin-wave phenomenon observed is a general effect inherent to the dynamics of sufficiently thick ferromagnetic single layer films, independent of the specific excitation method employed...|$|R
