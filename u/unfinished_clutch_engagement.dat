40|$|In most motor {{vehicles}} {{the transfer of}} torque from engine to the transmission is done through friction clutch. The process of <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> is characterized with intensive sliding between the friction surfaces until angular speeds of the drive and the driven parts become equal. Friction lining lifetime significantly depends on operating conditions which are expressed through total cumulative sliding work {{as a result of}} <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> number in certain traffic and exploitation conditions. From obvious reasons (time, cost, durability, etc.) constantly, it is endeavored most of the tests to be carried out in laboratory conditions. Although laboratory test methodologies are continually improved and in certain cases even standardized, structure differences in the individual clutches especially related friction material composition, leave this issue constantly opened. Starting from the statement above, the aim of the research is to show the process of establishing interdependence of friction lining wear and number of <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> in exploitation and laboratory conditions. Taking laboratory testing advantages, the aim is also to develop such procedures which can be the basis for forecasting its lifetime. ...|$|R
40|$|Dry dual {{clutches}} {{are widely}} used in automated manual transmissions. In such systems the <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> maneuvers require a precise knowledge of the characteristics that relate the frictional torque transmitted by the clutches with the corresponding actuators variables. In this paper a temperature and slip speed dependent model of the torque characteristic for dry dual clutches is proposed. Dynamic models of the temperature evolution are determined and linked to {{the characteristics of the}} mechanical components influencing the torque. The models, whose parameters are tuned with dedicated experiments and realistic data coming from an industrial automotive environment, show the temperature influence on the torque transmitted by the clutch. Real time simulation results, obtained through a detailed software in the loop driveline model, showthat, if not compensated, the temperature variation can determine critical degradations of the <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> performances. It is shown how the use of the clutch temperature estimation in the torque transmissibility model allows to compensate for such negative effects. The torque model is also exploited for the realization of a decoupling <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> controller. The corresponding closed loop results show the effectiveness of the proposed compensations for the dependencies of the clutch torque on temperature and slip speed...|$|R

This was achieved by optimizing several settings in the car including gear-ratio, fuel amount regulation, <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> and aerodynamics.|$|R
50|$|However, if engine {{temperature}} {{rises above the}} <b>clutch's</b> <b>engagement</b> temperature setting, the fan becomes fully engaged, thus drawing a higher volume of ambient air through the vehicle's radiator, which in turn serves to maintain or lower the engine coolant temperature to an acceptable level.|$|R
40|$|A multi-physics {{model is}} {{developed}} for predicting the dynamic behavior of wet <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> under realistic driving conditions. The transmission clutch plays {{a significant role}} in determining drivability and fuel economy. The present work overcomes previous limitations by constructing a detailed computational fluid dynamics model for wet <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement.</b> An open <b>clutch</b> model for single and multi-phase flow is developed. This model is used to provide the initial conditions for the dynamic engagement model. New extended boundary formulations are examined in order to reduce numerical errors at inlet and outlet boundaries. A new approach for squeeze-film flow is developed based on an iterative method. Given the external force responsible for plate movement, the squeeze velocity is computed by trial until the internal fluid stresses balance the external force. The latter are shown to have a major effect on squeeze-film flow and <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> in general. The model also captures the flow in the micro-channels created by the grooves on the friction material surface and the flow through the porous friction material. The <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> model combines the squeeze-film flow model with the influence of a rough surface on lubrication flow using the concept of flow factor, the mechanical contact based on the real contact area and the heat flux at the interface between the friction and separator using a virtual volume. A series of squeeze flow experiments were performed at the Ford Motor Company testing facility. The data are de-noised using standard statistical filters and then are used to validate the numerical results. Based on the comparison with the experimental data, the performance of the proposed model is found satisfactory. The wet clutch model developed in this research can become a baseline model for the prediction of the engagement behavior of a real wet clutch. When various material properties and further detailed geometric features are included, the present model may become an efficient alternative to laboratory testing and lead to designs that cannot be envisioned by other approaches...|$|R

The research has clarified the effects of operating parameters on the engagement characteristics of a wet clutch. The drive torque has a major effect on the engagement, but the friction coefficient is mainly independent of the operating conditions. The temperature rise is approximately a linear function of the developed energy. Increased temperature extends the engagement time and lowers the torque capacity, due to decreased friction coefficient.

40|$|The main {{contribution}} of control technology in automotive powertrain system is that, it enables the whole powertrain {{system to be}} precisely controlled; thereby, improving the overall vehicle powertrain performance and sustainability. This paper describes a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller development for an electro-mechanical friction clutch (EMFC) system for automotive applications especially, those using continuously variable transmission (CVT). Initially, a simulation study was carried out to determine the PID preliminary parameters values derived using the Astrom and Hagglund tuning method with Ziegler-Nichols formula; then, they are manually being fine- tuned experimentally to improve the <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> and disengagement control performance until satisfying engagement and disengagement process are achieved.

40|$|The {{tribological}} contact under sliding {{condition in}} the clutch facing surfaces during the engagement manoeuvre is strongly affected by heat transfer {{occurring in the}} system. The frictional forces acting on the contact surfaces produce mechanical energy losses which are converted in heat with ensuing temperature increase. Reports about the temperature rise after repeated <b>clutch</b> <b>engagements</b> prove the occurrence of interface temperature peaks as high as 300 °C. Unfortunately, only few papers address their focus towards experiments and their outcomes {{about the influence of}} temperature and the other operating parameters on the frictional behaviour of the clutch facing materials. In this paper, the Authors mainly explored the frictional behaviour modification for thermal level higher than 250 – 300 °C, whose effect is a sharp decline of the friction coefficient related to the decomposition of the phenol resin of the facings. Moreover, this phenomenon induces not expected transition from dry friction to mixed dry-lubricated friction which explains the reasons of the friction coefficient drop. The temperature affects also the cushion spring load-deflection characteristic and the ensuing transmitted clutch torque. Thus, an original frictional map has been implemented in a control algorithm to estimate the heat flux during vehicle launch and up-shift manoeuvres. The results of the longitudinal vehicle dynamics has been used in a FEA to predict the temperature field during repeated <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> on the contact surfaces. The simulation results prove that during each engagement the interface temperature increases of 30 – 35 °C. This means that after only few repeated <b>clutch</b> <b>engagements</b> the temperature field could reach values near the critical point of 300 °C. In such a way, this paper aims at providing useful references to control engineers in order to improve the dry-clutch transmissions performances...|$|R

40|$|Modeling {{and control}} of <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> has been {{recognized}} as a challenging control problem, due to nonlinear and time-varying dynamics, that is, switching between two discontinuous dynamic phases: the fill and the slip. Furthermore, the reference trajectories for obtaining an optimal <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> are not a priori known and may require adaptation to varying operating conditions. Two (nonlinear) model predictive control strategies are proposed based on the partial or full (non) linear identification of these two phases. First, a local linear model of the fill phase is identified and a robust model predictive control is designed {{to account for the}} consequent uncertainty in the slip phase. Second, (non) linear models of both the fill and the slip phases are identified and a two-level (nonlinear) model predictive control controller is proposed, where two (nonlinear) model predictive control controllers are designed for the two phases tracking references generated and continuously adapted by high-level iterative learning controllers. The robust and two-level (nonlinear) model predictive controls are validated on a real clutch. The results obtained from the real setup show that the proposed control strategies lead to an optimal engagement of the wet-clutch system...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} wet clutch torque {{transmission}} characteristics {{is a problem}} of both theoretical and practical interest. In this dissertation, the topic is examined from two parallel viewpoints; the fundamental approach involves detailed dynamic modeling of the contacting surfaces, while the applied approach includes a computationally efficient model for the gross features of <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement.</b> The model for torque transfer is validated with experimental data from the Wet Clutch Dynamic Test Rig. ^ The torque transfer model accurately predicts wet <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> performance over a wide range of input parameters. The results demonstrate the importance of accurately determining such parameters as friction material permeability, applied force, and friction coefficient. It is shown that the success of the predictions is closely related to the precise characterization of the friction coefficient. ^ The fundamental study involves the interaction of velocity-dependent friction coefficient and time-varying normal forces. A new type of friction-related dynamic instability is predicted using a perturbation analysis, and simulation results are presented to corroborate the predictions. A finite element model of the contact is developed, and stick-slip before lockup of the clutch disks is shown to produce torque oscillations under non-constant normal forces. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{friction}} transmission {{model of}} wet clutch is established {{to analyze the}} friction transmission mechanism of its engagement. The model is developed by applying both the average flow model and the elastic contact model between the friction disk and separator plate. The key components during wet <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement</b> are the separator plate, friction disk, and lubricant. The one-dimension transient models of heat transfer in radial direction for the three components are built {{on the basis of}} the heat transfer theory and the conservation law of energy. The friction transmission model and transient heat transfer models are coupled and solved by using the Runge-Kutta numerical method, and the radial temperature distribution and their detailed parametric study for the three components are conducted separately. The simulation results show that the radial temperature for the three components rises with the increase of radius in engagement. The changes in engagement pressure, lubricant viscosity, friction lining permeability, combined surface roughness RMS, equivalent elasticity modulus, difference between dynamic and static friction coefficients, and lubricant flow have important influence on the temperature rise characteristics. The proposed models can get better understanding of the dynamic temperature rise characteristics of wet <b>clutch</b> <b>engagement...</b>|$|R
