50|$|The company's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, began {{building}} a regional, 2G, 1900 MHz GSM, circuit switched, digital cellular network in 1994 and first offered service in 1996 in Honolulu and Salt Lake City.

The network has also expanded in capabilities through {{the introduction of new}} technologies. VoiceStream upgraded the 1900 MHz network to include packet switching via General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), then increased packet switched data transmission speeds via Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution. In 2006, the company spent $4.2 billion to purchase 120 D, E or F block 1700 MHz AWS licenses and began rolling out 3G UMTS services in those frequency bands.

5000|$|Phone {{companies}} and TV cable operators tend to oppose municipal broadband. They argue that municipal broadband {{would lead to}} the government monitoring of website usage through regulatory policy. In addition, opponents suggest that broadband usage should be private for a more secured freedom of speech and open networks, since this would promote competition and with it, innovation. Opponents posit that construction and implementation of municipal broadband would be costly. For example, the estimated municipal broadband system in Seattle, WA was $480 to $665 million. The opponents believe that the tax money should be spent on roads and landmarks instead of municipal broadband because, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, there is a greater need to solve problems of infrastructure in the U.S., and the government is the only investor. Opponents also claim that municipal broadband would take away environmental resources. They point to the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), a $4 billion project backed by the Obama Administration to install “115,000 miles of new or <b>upgraded</b> <b>network</b> miles” to connect 26,000 institutions. Cable operators state that the BTOP’s programs have led to environmental issues such as the “overbuilding of existing commercial plants.” ...|$|E

40|$|Intrusion {{detection}} is {{an essential}} component of critical infrastructure protection mechanisms. The traditional pure "knowledge engineering" process of building Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) is very slow, expensive, and error-prone. Current IDSs thus have limited extensibility in the face of changed or <b>upgraded</b> <b>network</b> configurations, and poor adaptability in the face of new attack methods. This thesis describes a novel framework, MADAM ID, for Mining Audit Data for Automated Models for Intrusion Detection. Classification rules are inductively learned from audit records and used as intrusion detection models. A critical requirement for the rules to be effective detection models is that an appropriate set of features need to be first constructed and included in the audit records. A key contribution of the thesis is thus in automatic "feature construction". Using MADAM ID, raw [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Fibre overlay is a {{cost-effective}} technique to alleviate wavelength blocking in some links of a wavelength-routed optical network {{by increasing the}} number of wavelengths in those links. In this letter, we investigate the effects of overlaying fibre in an all-optical network (AON) based on GÉANT 2 topology. The constraint-based routing and wavelength assignment (CB-RWA) algorithm locates where cost-efficient upgrades should be implemented. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate that the network capacity improves by 25 per cent by overlaying fibre on 10 per cent of the links, and by 12 per cent by providing hop reduction links comprising 2 per cent of the links. For the <b>upgraded</b> <b>network,</b> we also show the impact of dynamic traffic allocation on the blocking probability. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Over {{time there}} will be {{inevitable}} changes in the travel demand patterns in a transport network. To capture these changing demands and design a gradually <b>upgraded</b> <b>network</b> {{it is necessary to}} introduce the time dimension into the transport Network Design Problem (NDP). Previous efforts have extended the continuous network design problem to cater for such considerations. However the continuous problem does not always indicate improvements that are practical. Therefore in this paper we develop a model of the time-dependent discrete network design problem. The importance of the model is illustrated by two numerical studies, which demonstrate the importance of introducing the time dimension to the NDP and the importance of introducing discrete decision variables to the NDP over time. An example on NDP under two cost-recovery principles is also provided to illustrate the application of the model. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Network {{operators}} of competing infrastructures in European electronic communications markets face asymmetric regulation: incumbent telecommunications firms {{are required to}} open their networks for retail broadband competition, while cable companies have no such obligation. Furthermore, for historical reasons, cable companies have better quality networks thanks to the DOCSIS 3. 0 technology than DSL-based telecom firms. How would the market structure of electronic communications markets {{and the quality of}} networks develop in the presence of asymmetric regulation and original quality differences? Based on a location model for product differentiation, i find that access revenues can compensate incumbent telecom firms for the loss due to having a lower quality network than cable companies. Therefore, access obligation reduces the incentives of telecom firms to compete with cable companies by <b>upgrading</b> <b>network</b> quality. In the absence of retail competitors without networks, however, telecom firms need to <b>upgrade</b> <b>network</b> quality to be able to remain competitive with cable companies. Furthermore and in line with the existing literature, the exclusion of retail competitors is more likely in the presence of higher access prices and stronger substitutuion between firms' products. Finally, if the original differences between network quality is large and high returns on investments are unlikely, telecom firms {{may not be able to}} invest sufficiently and lose substantially from their market shares...|$|R

40|$|We propose BANANAS, a {{connectionless}} {{framework for}} both intra-domain and inter-domain traffic engineering (TE) in the Internet. The key contributions of this framework are: a) {{it allows the}} source to discover multiple paths and decide on how to split traffic among paths (assuming simple forwarding extensions in a subset of routers). b) {{it does not require}} signaling, or high per-packet overhead. c) it enables an incremental upgrade strategy for both intradomain (OSPF) and inter-domain (BGP) routing to support TE capabilities. d) in a fully <b>upgraded</b> <b>network,</b> every source can control how traffic is mapped to paths and therefore network-wide traffic engineering objectives can be achieved. A path to a destination address is parsimoniously specified in a fixed-length "PathID" field in the packet header. "PathID" is the sum of link weights on the path (or the sum of Autonomous System (AS) numbers for inter-domain paths). This encoding allows efficient connectionless forwarding without using a signaling protocol. We describe extensions to OSPF, and BGP to support the proposed framework. We propose a simple multi-path computation algorithm under partial upgrade assumptions, discuss traffic splitting techniques and forwarding extensions.
