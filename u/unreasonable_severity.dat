Their distinctive feature is the relatively late diagnosis, which requiring the necessity, in addition to removing the tumor and bone grafting, {{to solve the problem}} of deformations correction. We have discovered the reasons of deformity appearance of the 31 patients aged 3 - 16 years. The following types of deformation were defined: ductile (12), after pathological fracture (12) and as a result of growth plate dysfunction (7). The correction of deformation, along with the tumour removing was performed at 15 patients: 3 - Oilier disease, 6 - fibrous dysplasia, 4 - bone cysts, 2 - exostotic chondrodysplasia. In 2 cases the correction of deformity was supposed <b>unreasonable</b> by its <b>severity</b> and accompanying pathology, and in 14 - the deformities were considered as permissible, that not required operative adjustment. </span...|$|R
