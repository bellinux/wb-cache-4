5|$|On February 10 Matsui {{received}} a messenger from the Army General Staff who informed him, much to Matsui's chagrin and disappointment, {{that he would}} soon be relieved of command and replaced with Shunroku Hata. Ultimately, the Army General Staff did not punish Matsui but they did shake <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> field command in China and Matsui {{was just one of}} eighty senior officers, including Asaka and Yanagawa, who were all recalled at the same time.|$|E
5|$|We {{went into}} the booth to record the song. She {{originally}} {{wanted to do a}} Mike Skinner thing, rapping the verse and singing the chorus. But I asked her to sing it all, and she just made <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E
5|$|All clues lead F.E.A.R. {{to believe}} Fettel is being {{controlled}} by Alma, who {{was locked in}} the Origin facility when ATC closed down the project owing to the danger the woman posed; Fettel is searching for that same facility to free his mother. The player takes the Point Man to the abandoned structure, fighting back both the clone soldiers and ATC guards, who have received orders to cover <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> affair. When the protagonist comes to finally face Fettel, he is drawn into a hallucination where the player learns how the Point Man is Alma's first son and is thereafter enabled to kill Fettel himself.|$|E

5|$|It {{was only}} by nightfall, when John the Armenian with his {{men and the}} 600 Huns rejoined his army, that Belisarius {{realized}} {{the extent of his}} victory. The cavalry spent the night at the battlefield. In the next morning, as the infantry (and Antonina) caught <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> army made for Carthage, where it arrived as night was falling. The Carthaginians had thrown open the gates and illuminated the city in celebration, but Belisarius, fearing a possible ambush in the darkness and wishing to keep his soldiers under tight control, refrained from entering the city, and encamped before it.|$|E
5|$|Together, {{they went}} to see Kutuzov, who nonchalantly gave his permission. There was no clear plan and no {{objectives}} had been drawn <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> manoeuvre being interpreted by both Kutuzov and Uvarov as a feint. Uvarov and Platov thus set off, having just around 8000 cavalrymen and 12 guns in total, and no infantry support. As Uvarov moved southwest and south and Platov moved west, they eventually arrived in the undefended rear of Viceroy Eugène's IV Corps. This was towards midday, just as the Viceroy was getting his orders to conduct another assault on the Raevski redoubt.|$|E
5|$|After {{eliminating}} an Austrian army {{during the}} Ulm Campaign, French forces seized Vienna in November 1805. The Austrians avoided further conflict until {{the arrival of}} the Russians bolstered Allied numbers. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so he could feign a grave weakness. Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near Austerlitz. He deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> French line. A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time. Meanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened the allied center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the IV Corps of Marshal Soult. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process.|$|E

5|$|The {{first half}} of the anime's plot follows that of the manga, but the plots {{severely}} diverge from each other near the middle of the story. After Kimblee uses alchemy to transform Al's armor into explosive material, Scar transfers all of his incomplete Philosopher's Stone into Al to save his life. As a result, Alphonse's armor becomes the Philosopher's Stone. Because he houses the Stone in his body, he becomes the primary target of the homunculi's leader Dante, who is trying to cheat death. Once captured by the homunculi for Dante, Al is to be eaten by Gluttony to complete the Stone inside Gluttony's body. But when he sees his brother killed trying to save him, Al uses the stone's power to heal Edward's body and re-bind his soul to it. This destroys Al's own body as he uses <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the Philosopher's Stone in the transmutations. Then Edward, using his own body, resurrects Alphonse. As a result, Edward disappears and Alphonse continues studying alchemy to find him.|$|E

25|$|If two {{positive}} fractions {{have the}} same numerator, then the fraction with the smaller denominator is the larger number.

When two positive fractions {{have the same}} numerator, they represent {{the same number of}} parts, but in the fraction with the smaller denominator, the parts are larger.|$|E
25|$|Some {{two weeks}} after the incident, police closed the case, {{concluding}} that she made <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing. Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Robert Kaliňák declared that none of Malina's claims could be confirmed. Her mobile network operator did not record any call on the day in question. She explained that she had told the police several times that she did not remember whether she had been speaking Hungarian on her phone or to someone in the street.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1918, 75th Division joined General Allenby's final {{offensive}} (the Battles of Megiddo). At the Battle of Sharon (19 September), 75th Division successfully assaulted Miske and the Turkish trench system around the village of Et Tire. For this attack Palin also had under his command 'A' Squadron (Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry) and 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery, Machine Gun Corps, which he sent up with {{his chief of staff}} to outflank the village. By 17.00, XXI Corps' attack had rolled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Turkish right and allowed the Desert Mounted Corps to sweep forward to complete the envelopment of the Turkish army and begin the pursuit.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} 12 pictures {{indicate the}} virtuosity that these artists had attained, and the obvious cooperation between individuals who normally employed very different styles and skills. The paintings gave full range to their capabilities as they included {{a great number}} of figures of men, women and children and characters ranging from guiding angels to enraged Pharaohs and the devil himself. Each painting required a landscape. Because of the scale of the figures that the artists agreed upon, in each picture, the landscape and sky take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> upper half of the scene. Sometimes, as in Botticelli's scene of The Purification of the Leper, there are additional small narratives taking place in the landscape, in this case The Temptations of Christ.|$|E
25|$|The novelist Fanny Burney {{stayed in}} Ilfracombe in 1817. Her diary entries (31 July – 5 October) record early 19th century life in Ilfracombe: a {{captured}} Spanish ship; two ships in distress in a storm; {{the visit of}} Thomas Bowdler; and her lucky escape after being cut off by the tide. A few years later in the 1820s a set of four tunnels were hand carved by Welsh miners to permit access to the beaches by horse-drawn carriage {{as well as by}} foot. Previously access was gained by climbing the cliffs, rounding the point by boat, swimming or at the lowest tides clambering around the rocks of the point. These tunnels led to a pair of tidal pools, which in accordance with Victorian morals, were used for segregated male and female bathing. Whereas women were constrained to a strict dress code covering <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> body, men generally swam naked. The tunnels are still viewable and are signposted as Tunnels Beaches.|$|E
25|$|PIA {{launched}} its new livery in early April 2010. An Airbus A310, Boeing 777–200 and Boeing 747–300 {{were the first}} aircraft to wear the new look. The livery was unveiled at the PIA headquarters on a Boeing 777 model. The livery consisted of a green and gold strip running around {{the bottom of the}} fuselage and continuing right up until the tail cone. The forward/upper portion was white and at the rear, it was an off white/beige color. The bottom part of the tail blended into the upper fuselage as it too is white, {{with the rest of the}} tail painted with a large wavy Pakistan flag, which takes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> tail, in a dark green color. At the front of the fuselage 'PIA' was written in a billboard style in dark green and underneath 'Pakistan' was written in golden color. Just behind the cockpit there is a stylized Urdu PIA logo as well as on the engines.|$|E

25|$|The {{cabinets}} of the Netherlands and Belgium {{are excellent}} models of design. These {{pieces of furniture}} were usually arranged in two storeys with a fine moulded and carved cornice, mid division and plinth. The pilasters at the sides, and small raised panels carved only on the projecting part, would compose a very harmonious whole. A proportion of the French cabinets are decorated with caryatids not carved in the best taste, and, like other French woodwork of this period, are sometimes overloaded with sculpture. The doors of St Maclou, Rouen, fine as they are, would hardly to-day be held up as models for imitation. A noteworthy set of doors belong to the Oudenaarde Town Hall. The central door contains twelve and that on either side eight panels, {{each of which is}} carved with Renaissance foliage surrounding an unobtrusive figure. In the Palais de Justice we see that great scheme of decoration which takes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the fireplace end of the hall. Five large figures carved in the round are surrounded by small ones and with foliage and coats of arms.|$|E
