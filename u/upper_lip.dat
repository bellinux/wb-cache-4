5|$|In 2002, AC/DC {{signed a}} long-term, multi-album deal with Sony Music, {{who went on}} to release a series of remastered albums as part of their AC/DC remasters series. Each release {{contained}} an expanded booklet featuring rare photographs, memorabilia, and notes. In 2003, the entire back-catalogue (except Ballbreaker and Stiff <b>Upper</b> <b>Lip)</b> was remastered and re-released. Ballbreaker was eventually re-released in October 2005; Stiff <b>Upper</b> <b>Lip</b> was later re-released in April 2007. Also in 2003, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the rhinarium {{does not have any}} {{olfactory}} receptors, so it is not used for smell in terms of detecting volatile substances. Instead, it has sensitive touch receptors (Merkel cells). The rhinarium, <b>upper</b> <b>lip,</b> and gums are tightly connected by a fold of mucous membrane called the philtrum, which runs from the tip of the nose to the mouth. The <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> is constrained by this connection and has fewer nerves to control movement, which leaves it less mobile than the upper lips of simians. The philtrum creates a gap (diastema) between the roots of the first two upper incisors.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of a}} banded sea krait is black, with lateral {{nostrils}} and an undivided rostral scale. The <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> and snout are characteristically colored yellow, and the yellow color extends backward {{on each side of}} the head above the eye to the temporal scales.|$|E
50|$|Flews are a dog's <b>upper</b> <b>lips,</b> or the canine {{equivalent}} of <b>upper</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>upper</b> <b>lips</b> {{are falling}} {{position}} and are thick, but without printing or looseness or drooling. The nose and lower lips are tight {{and are not}} as they fall below the <b>upper</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|R
50|$|Stiff <b>Upper</b> <b>Lips</b> (1998) {{is a broad}} {{parody of}} British period films, {{especially}} the lavish Merchant-Ivory productions of the 1980s and early 1990s. Although it specifically targets A Room with a View, Chariots of Fire, Maurice, A Passage to India, and many other films, in a more general way Stiff <b>Upper</b> <b>Lips</b> satirises popular perceptions of certain Edwardian traits: propriety, sexual repression, xenophobia, and class snobbery.|$|R
5|$|Before, Beyoncé's {{approach}} to heartbreak was always literal, {{her voice and}} her words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness that at times was difficult to believe, let alone connect with. 'Irreplaceable' is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date.|$|E
5|$|Black Ice is {{the fifteenth}} studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC. It was the band's fourteenth internationally {{released}} studio album and the fifteenth in Australia. Released internationally on 17 October 2008, it {{was produced by}} Brendan O'Brien. It marked the band's first original recordings since 2000's Stiff <b>Upper</b> <b>Lip,</b> with the eight-year gap being the longest between AC/DC's successive studio albums. Black Ice has the longest running time of any AC/DC studio album.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{investigating}} the splash dispersal of peridioles {{have shown a}} maximum horizontal distance for peridiole ejection of , less than that observed for other Cyathus species. This reduced ejection distance {{may be due to}} such factors as the greater size of peridioles, the looser construction of the funiculus, or the increased flaring seen in the <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> of the splash cup.|$|E
60|$|The marine sergeants are {{generally}} tall fellows with unyielding spines and stiff <b>upper</b> <b>lips,</b> and very exclusive in their tastes and predilections.|$|R
5000|$|The Times, in retrospect, humorously {{described}} the magazine as about [...] "brave chaps with large moustaches on stiff <b>upper</b> <b>lips,</b> who did stupid and dangerous things".|$|R
50|$|They are {{distinguished}} from the Old World porcupines in that they have rooted molars, complete collar bones, entire <b>upper</b> <b>lips,</b> tuberculated soles, no trace of first front toes, and four teats.|$|R
5|$|Oryzomys couesi {{was first}} {{reported}} from Colombia in 1987, when Philip Hershkovitz reported on its occurrence at Montería in Córdoba Department, northwestern Colombia. The Colombian specimen is ochraceous in color throughout {{and according to}} Hershkovitz almost identical to specimens from Guatemala, but distinctive in that the <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> is white. He suggested that O.couesi may also be discovered in the Pacific lowlands of the Chocó in western Colombia.|$|E
5|$|Black Ice is AC/DC's fifteenth studio album {{release in}} Australia and their fourteenth {{international}} release. The band {{took a break}} after finishing the Stiff <b>Upper</b> <b>Lip</b> World Tour in 2001, and resumed performing in 2003, with eight presentations that included AC/DC's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and they opened three concerts for The Rolling Stones' Licks Tour. During those two years, guitarists Angus Young and Malcolm Young wrote music separately, then met in a London studio to work on new songs.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York on July 31, 1912. His parents, Sára Ethel (née Landau) and Jenő Saul Friedman, were Jewish {{immigrants}} from Beregszász in Carpathian Ruthenia, Kingdom of Hungary (now Berehove in Ukraine). They both worked as dry goods merchants. Shortly after Milton's birth, the family relocated to Rahway, New Jersey. In his early teens, Friedman was injured in a car accident, which scarred his <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b> A talented student, Friedman graduated from Rahway High School in 1928, just before his 16th birthday.|$|E

50|$|This plant grows only on Mauna Kea and the Kohala Mountains of Hawaii, {{where its}} habitat is wet forests. There are four occurrences, {{for a total}} of under 20 {{individual}} plants. This liana can grow to 3 meters in length. It bears white flowers with pink <b>upper</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|R
5000|$|These bats {{are also}} known as 'tear-drop' fruit bats because of the {{prominent}} tear-like white spots found {{on both sides of}} their eyes and on their <b>upper</b> <b>lips.</b> Their fur is tainted and the wings a dark brown. They measure 74-78 millimeters and weigh between 35 and 60 grams.|$|R
5|$|In the 2009–10 season, Yi {{returned}} to the starting lineup for New Jersey. Starting in every game he played but one, Yi suffered several injuries during the season which made him miss 30 games. He sprained his medial collateral ligament on 4 November 2009, had a laceration on his <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> on 8 December 2009, and sprained his left ankle on 8 March 2009. His final averages for the season were 12 points and 7.2 rebounds per game, {{as well as a}} 40% shooting percentage from the field and 37% on three-point field goals.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 2008, Columbia Records {{announced}} 18 October Australian release, and 20 October worldwide release, of {{the studio}} album Black Ice. The 15-track album was the band's first studio release in eight years, was produced by Brendan O'Brien and was mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser. Like Stiff <b>Upper</b> <b>Lip,</b> it was recorded at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia. Black Ice was sold in the US exclusively at Walmart and Sam's Club and the band's official website.|$|E

She also has several piercings, including a 'Monroe' (a piercing near the <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> that resembles a beauty mark) and 'Snakebites' (a piercing {{on each side of the}} lower lip).|$|E
5000|$|He {{went on to}} co-found the Fun Boy Three with Terry Hall and Neville Staple. [...] Recently he was touring with The Beat, {{a reunion}} version of another second wave ska band. He started a band in Seattle, Stiff <b>Upper</b> <b>Lips,</b> that was fairly short lived, but which {{recently}} reformed as Gigantor.|$|R
5000|$|Stiff <b>Upper</b> <b>Lips</b> {{received}} mixed reviews. Alexander Walker of the Evening Standard {{called it}} [...] "A Spot of Spiffing Spoofery" [...] while the Time Out reviewer said [...] "it is beautifully acted and consistently spot on". [...] Stephen Holden of the New York Times, however, lamented [...] "If only it were funnier".|$|R

"It may be, lad; but {{the wind}} draws in on the other side, an' I'm allowin' that this shanty, small as it is, won't come to harm, though if it does go, we'll try to keep our <b>upper</b> <b>lips</b> stiff so the villainous red-coats shan't {{have a chance to}} crow over us very much." ...|$|R
5|$|The modern {{clarinet}} {{developed from}} a Baroque instrument called the chalumeau. This instrument {{was similar to}} a recorder, but with a single-reed mouthpiece and a cylindrical bore. Lacking a register key, it was played mainly in its fundamental register, with a limited range of about {{one and a half}} octaves. It had eight finger holes, like a recorder, and two keys for its two highest notes. At this time, contrary to modern practice, the reed was placed in contact with the <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b>|$|E
5|$|The reed {{is on the}} {{underside}} of the mouthpiece, pressing against the player's lower lip, while the top teeth normally contact the top of the mouthpiece (some players roll the <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> under the top teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure). Adjustments in the strength and shape of the embouchure change the tone and intonation (tuning). It is not uncommon for clarinetists to employ methods to relieve the pressure on the upper teeth and inner lower lip by attaching pads to the top of the mouthpiece or putting (temporary) padding on the front lower teeth, commonly from folded paper.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{took three}} years to release a {{follow-up}} album. After a decade without taking time off, {{he said in an}} interview, he needed to get away from music completely and ceased listening to it for several months. Also suffering from writer's block, he seriously considered leaving the music business for good. Speculation that an extended jam session would be released either under the title Mechanical Bliss, or Naked in the Jungle, or Stiff <b>Upper</b> <b>Lip,</b> came to nothing, and Morrison's next album was A Period of Transition in 1977, a collaboration with Dr. John, who had appeared at The Last Waltz concert with Morrison in 1976. The album received a mild critical reception and marked the beginning of a very prolific period of song making.|$|E
50|$|Dorsally, T. macrolepis {{is bright}} green, with blackish skin between the scales in some places. There is a yellow or white stripe {{on each side}} of the body, which runs along the first dorsal scale row. The <b>upper</b> <b>lips</b> are pale green, and there may be a black streak behind the eye. Ventrally, it is pale greenish.|$|R
50|$|Regina rigida is olive brown dorsally. Additionally, two blackish dorsal stripes {{may or may}} not be present. The <b>upper</b> <b>lips</b> (labial scales) are yellow. Ventrally it is yellow {{with two}} {{parallel}} series of black spots, which merge anteriorly into a single series. The ventral surface of the tail may have a median black line, or it may be unmarked.|$|R
50|$|Head longish, rectangular, with {{slightly}} arched and moderately broad skull. Occiput not too prominent. Stop well defined but not over pronounced. Jowls not too heavy. Muzzle fairly long, large and rectangular. Bridge of nose straight and parallel to line of skull. Nose always black, well developed with large nostrils. <b>Upper</b> <b>lips</b> full {{but not too}} overhanging.|$|R
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is congenital and {{is characterized by}} a number of nasal, facial and cranial features. These include a broad and high, sometimes depressed nasal bridge (top of the nose, between the eyes) and a flattened nasal tip. This can give the nose a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the eyebrow ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of skin over the eyelids), a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging of the <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|Rymkus's {{success in}} high school led to a {{scholarship}} to the University of Notre Dame, where he played from 1940 to 1942. He was known in college as a tough and durable tackle. In a 1941 game against Georgia Tech, Rymkus was elbowed in his <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b> He left the game to get 14 stitches and returned {{to play in the}} 20–0 Notre Dame victory. Notre Dame went undefeated that season, coach Frank Leahy's first year at the school. During his junior year in 1942, Rymkus earned All-America honors, and in his final season at Notre Dame he was named the team's Most Valuable Player.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat was}} a uniform bluish-grey, with a pale whitish belly, {{which was not}} contrasted on the flanks. The limbs had a faint dark line along their front surface. The {{forehead}} was brown, darker than the face, and the <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> and patch {{in front of the}} eyes were lighter than the body. The neck-mane was directed forwards and not as developed as in the roan and sable antelopes, and the throat-mane was almost absent. Other differences between the bluebuck and its extant relatives included its shorter and blunter ears not tipped with black, a darker tail tuft (though little darker than its general colour), and smaller teeth. The bluebuck also lacked the contrasting black and white patterns seen on the heads of its relatives.|$|E
50|$|While Amish men grow beards when {{married and}} never trim them, they eschew moustaches and {{continue}} shaving their <b>upper</b> <b>lips.</b> This {{is rooted in}} {{a rejection of the}} German military fashion of sporting moustaches, which was prevalent {{at the time of the}} Amish community's formation in Europe, hence serving as a symbol of their commitment to pacifism.|$|R
60|$|A shrug of the {{shoulders}} {{was all the}} answer she got. We rode by the lanes; through sloping farmyards, all mud and pigs, and dirty straw, and farmers with clean-shaven <b>upper</b> <b>lips</b> and whiskers under the chin; past fields of corn, where larks were singing. Up or down, we didn't draw rein till we came to Dan's hotel.|$|R
50|$|As well as {{producing}} big budget genre movies, Bolt {{also produced}} the art house film Vigo for Film Four (directed by Julien Temple), and the comedy Stiff <b>Upper</b> <b>Lips</b> (starring Peter Ustinov). He has also produced There’s Only One Jimmy Grimble (starring Ray Winstone and Robert Carlyle), and teen horror The Hole (starring Thora Birch and Keira Knightley), both for Pathe Pictures.|$|R
