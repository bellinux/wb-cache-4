40|$|This {{review article}} underlines the {{importance}} of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for determination of steroids in man. The use of steroids labelled with stable isotopes as internal standard and subsequent analysis by GC-MS yields up to now the only reliable measurement of steroids in serum. Isotope dilution GC-MS is the reference method for evaluation of routine analysis of serum steroid hormones. GC-MS is an important tool for detection of steroid hormone doping and combined with a combustion furnace and an isotope ratio mass spectrometer the misuse of testosterone by athletes can be discovered. Finally the so called <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profile</b> by GC and GC-MS is the method of choice for detection of steroid metabolites in health and disease. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Nowadays, {{testosterone}} {{remains a}} highly abused {{anabolic androgenic steroid}} {{for the practice of}} doping. There are many causes that make its detection particularly complicated,since it is an endogenous compound and its concentration in spot urine samples is highly variable (inter and intra-individuals) Many approaches have been proposed for the detection of T misuse. From the classical T/E (reference population, WADA) to personalize the references, the individual became its own reference, using an univariate or multivariate analysis approach for the statistical discrimination of steroid profile in the detection of abnormal profiles. None of this excludes previous approaches, all of them use the anabolic steroid profile, and are part of the WADA effort to establish and improved the athlete biological passport.

40|$|The use of supra-physiological, {{exogenous}} corticosteroids {{in pregnancy}} {{may lead to}} neonatal adrenal suppression. We report on a single-center, case series study carried out between 2006 and 2014, which included all newborns (n = 16) of mothers using prednisolone >= 10 mg/day during pregnancy. Newborns were routinely assessed according to hospital protocol, with follow-up until 6 weeks after birth. We investigated the clinical symptoms and biochemical findings of adrenal suppression occurring in the newborns.

40|$|In {{the fight}} against doping, steroid {{profiling}} is a powerful tool to detect drug misuse with endogenous anabolic androgenic steroids. To establish sensitive and reliable models, the factors influencing profiling should be recognised.

Technical aspects are also discussed as they could {{have a significant impact on}} the steroid profile, and thus the steroid module of the athlete biological passport (ABP). The different factors impacting the major components of the steroid profile must be understood to ensure scientifically sound interpretation through the Bayesian model of the ABP.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) study {{carried out on}} human urine to verify whether the administration of glucocorticoids can affect the <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profile,</b> and especially the levels of endogenous glucocorticoids, androgens and their main metabolites. Betamethasone and beclomethasone, administered either systemically (per os or i. m.) or locally (by inhalation) have been studied. The determination of the urinary levels of endogenous glucocorticoids and androgens was carried out by GC–MS in electron impact ionization mode. Data were evaluated taking into account the baseline individual variability, and compared with values obtained on a control group. Detectable differences were recorded in the steroids metabolites excretion profiles between men and women. The circadian variability of the steroid profile was the same for both sexes, showing a maximum during the morning hours. After systemic treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids, the relative urinary concentrations of corticosteroids, androgens and of their metabolites were significantly altered, recording a transient decrease of the concentration of cortisol and tetrahydrocortisol and a parallel, although less pronounced, increase of the concentration of testosterone, epitestosterone and related androgenic steroids; while no effects were recorded if the administration was by inhalation...|$|E

40|$|Background: Late {{presentation}} of congenital adrenal hyperplasia as a 46,XX disorder of sex development due to 11 -β hydroxylase deficiency is uncommon. Such a case raises issues regarding appropriate investigation and management. Case History: A 5 -year-old {{boy who had}} recently moved to the United Kingdom presented at the endocrinology clinic with recurrent abdominal pain. He was normotensive and {{had a history of}} ambiguous genitalia since birth, a relatively small penis, bilateral cryptorchidism and pubic hair. A systematic workup revealed low anti-Mullerian hormone levels for age and sex and elevated serum testosterone, androstenedione and deoxycortisol levels. A <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profile</b> confirmed a diagnosis of 11 -β hydroxylase deficiency. The child’s karyotype was 46,XX. Further genetic analysis revealed a compound heterozygote mutation in the CYP 11 B 1 gene. Ultrasound scan showed evidence of Mullerian structures and accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina (haematocolpos). Following discussion at a multidisciplinary clinic, the patient did not undergo sex reassignment and subsequently proceeded to surgery for removal of the Mullerian structures. Conclusions: This case emphasizes the importance of a systematic approach to investigation of older children presenting with apparent male undermasculinisation. It also raises important issues about gender reassignment in mid-childhood and the indications for removal of Mullerian organs in a 46,XX bo...|$|E

We report circadian {{rhythms of the}} major steroid metabolites and derived ratios in urine collected at 3 -h intervals over 24 h, after first establishing that disturbance of sleep associated with collection does not alter rhythms on the succeeding day. Methods Assay of steroid metabolites (gas chromatography) and creatinine in urine collections made by 10 men and 10 women every 3 h starting at 2100 for 24 h. Data were subjected to cosinor analysis. Results Summed cortisol and androgen metabolites exhibited significant circadian rhythms, as expected, but with a surprisingly long time-lag (maxima at around 1400). Amplitudes were different, so that the ratio cortisol/androgen metabolites also showed a significant rhythm. The ratios 5 a/ 5 b tetrahydrocortisol and 20 -hydroxy/ 20 -oxo cortisol metabolites showed significant rhythms which were not in phase with total cortisol metabolites, while 11 -hydroxy/ 11 -oxo cortisol metabolites showed no rhythm. There were no gender differences in time of maxima. Previously established gender differences in metabolite levels were confirmed. Creatinine levels showed no circadian rhythm.

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are small}} non-coding RNAs that {{regulate}} gene expression and thus influence many cellular and physiological processes. miRNAs are {{also present in}} cell-free body fluids such as plasma or serum, and these circulating miRNAs are very stable, sensitive, and specific biomarkers of pathophysiological states. In this study, we investigated whether circulating miRNAs could serve as biomarkers of exogenous testosterone administration. Misuse of testosterone as a performance-enhancing drug {{is thought to be}} widespread in sports. Detection of testosterone through the <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profile</b> of the Athlete Biological Passport faces several obstacles, indicating that new biomarkers are required. To this end, we analyzed plasma miRNA levels by high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR. Plasma samples were obtained before and at several time points after transdermal and oral testosterone administration. Screening identified three potential candidate miRNAs that were altered by both routes of testosterone administration. Longitudinal monitoring of these candidates revealed that variation in two of them (miR- 150 and miR- 342), relative to the corresponding levels in control samples, was testosterone-independent. However, levels of the liver-specific miR- 122 increased 3. 5 -fold 1 day after drug intake. Given that testosterone is metabolized by the liver, this observation suggests that miR- 122 in cell-free fluids may be used as a sensitive biomarker of testosterone misuse via multiple dosing routes and could therefore be integrated into a blood-based multiparametric follow-up...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: <b>Urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profiling</b> {{is used in}} doping {{controls}} to detect testosterone abuse. A testosterone over epitestosterone (T/E) ratio exceeding 4. 0 is considered as suspicious of testosterone administration, irrespectively of individual heterogeneous {{factors such as the}} athlete's ethnicity. A deletion polymorphism in the UGT 2 B 17 gene was demonstrated to account for {{a significant part of the}} interindividual variability in the T/E between Caucasians and Asians. Here, the variability of <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profiles</b> was examined in a widely heterogeneous cohort of professional soccer players. Method: The <b>steroid</b> <b>profile</b> of 57 Africans, 32 Asians, 50 Caucasians and 32 Hispanics was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Significant differences have been observed between all ethnic groups. After estimation of the prevalence of the UGT 2 B 17 deletion/deletion genotype (African: 22 %; Asian: 81 %; Caucasian: 10 %; Hispanic: 7 %), ethnic-specific thresholds were developed for a specificity of 99 % for the T/E (African: 5. 6; Asian: 3. 8; Caucasian: 5. 7; Hispanic: 5. 8). Finally, another polymorphism could be hypothesised in Asians based on specific concentration ratio of 5 alpha-/ 5 beta-androstane- 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol in urine. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that a unique and non-specific threshold to evidence testosterone misuse is not fit for purpose. An athlete's endocrinological passport consisting of a longitudinal follow-up together with the ethnicity and/or the genotype would strongly enhance the detection of testosterone abuse. Finally, additional genotyping studies should be undertaken to determine whether the remaining unexplained disparities have an environmental or a genetic origin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{biochemical}} {{diagnosis of}} 21 -hydroxylase deficiency (21 -OHD) is difficult in preterm infants. To date, no marker for the biochemical diagnosis of 21 -OHD has been found. Seventeen α-hydroxyprogesterone (17 -OHP), is not useful because of interference by delta 5 steroids from the fetal adrenal cortex. A 5 -d-old female infant, born at 31 wk of gestation, was {{suspected of having}} 21 -OHD based on physical findings (mild clitoromegaly, pigmentation of the tongue and gingiva) as well as laboratory data (17 -OHP> 93. 5 ng/ml by ELISA 7 prime extractive method in filter paper-dried blood spot and 718. 3 ng/ml by RIA after high performance liquid chromatography extraction in serum; plasma ACTH 690 pg/ml; and serum testosterone 3, 169 ng/dl). We examined her <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profiles</b> by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in selected ion monitoring (GCMS-SIM) at 8 d of age. The pregnanetriolone (Ptl) level was noticeably high (0. 80 mg/g creatinine), which was strongly suggestive of 21 -OHD. Gene analysis of CYP 21 A 2 showed compound heterozygosity, one allele having a cluster mutation in exon 6 and the other having a large deletion including CYP 21 A 2, confirming the diagnosis of 21 -OHD. This case suggested that, in preterm infants, urinary Ptl by GCMS-SIM can be useful for the biochemical diagnosis of 21 -OHD.

40|$|The <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profile</b> is {{constituted}} by anabolic androgenic steroids, including testosterone and its relatives, that are extensively metabolized into phase II sulfated or glucuronidated steroids. The use of liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) {{is an issue}} for the direct analysis of conjugated steroids, {{which can be used}} as urinary markers of exogenous steroid administration in doping analysis, without hydrolysis of the conjugated moiety. In this study, a sensitive and selective ultra high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) method was developed to quantify major urinary metabolites simultaneously after testosterone intake. The sample preparation of the urine (1  mL) was performed by solid-phase extraction on Oasis HLB sorbent using a 96 -well plate format. The conjugated steroids were analyzed by UHPLC-QTOF-MS(E) with a single-gradient elution of 36  min (including re-equilibration time) in the negative electrospray ionization mode. MS(E) analysis involved parallel alternating acquisitions of both low- and high-collision energy functions. The method was validated and applied to samples collected from a clinical study performed with a group of healthy human volunteers who had taken testosterone, which were compared with samples from a placebo group. Quantitative results were also compared to GC-MS and LC-MS/MS measurements, and the correlations between data were found appropriate.

The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the effect of the completion of a short con- centric (CON) and concentric/eccentric (CON/ECC) trial on the <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profile,</b> both with the same total work. 18 males performed the trials on an isokinet- ic dynamometer (BIODEX III) exercising quadriceps muscles, right and left, on dif- ferent days. Trial 1 (CON) : 4 x 10 Concentric knee extension + relax knee flexion, speed 60 o/second; rest 90 seconds between each series and 4 minutes between each leg exercise. Trial 2 (CON/ECC) : 4 x 5 concentric knee extension + Eccentric knee flex- ion under similar conditions. Urine samples were taken before the exercise and one hour after finishing it. Androsterone, Etiocholanolone, DHEA, Androstenedione, Testosterone, Epitestosterone, Dehydrotestosterone, Estrone, B-Estradiol, Tetrahy- drocortisone, Tetrahydrocortisol, Cortisone and Cortisol (free, glucoconjugated and sulfoconjugated) urinary values were determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques. No significant differences were noted in Total Work and Average Peak Torque, although Maximum Peak Torque in the CON/ECC trial was higher than in the CON trial. These results demonstrate no changes in the steroid profile before and after trials, or when comparing CON to CON/ECC trials.

A mouse model, in which exons 3 - 7 of Cyp 11 b 1 (the gene encoding 11 β-hydroxylase) were replaced with cDNA encoding enhanced cyan fluorescent protein, was generated to investigate the underlying disease mechanisms.

Because rodents do not synthesize adrenal androgens, changes in reproductive function such as genital virilization of females were not anticipated. However, adult homozygote females were infertile, their ovaries showing an absence of corpora lutea and a central proliferation of disorganized steroidogenic tissue. Null females responded normally to superovulation, suggesting that raised systemic progesterone levels also contribute to infertility problems.

40|$|Context: Recurrence of hypercortisolism in {{patients}} after bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing disease is extremely rare. Patient: We present a 27 -year-old man who previously underwent bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing disease with complete clinical resolution. Cushingoid features recurred 12 years later, with bilateral testicular enlargement. Hormonal tests confirmed adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) -dependent Cushing disease. Surgical resection of the testicular tumors led to clinical and biochemical remission. Design and Results: Gene expression {{analysis of the}} tumor tissue by quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed high expression of all key steroidogenic enzymes. Adrenocortical-specific genes were 5. 1 x 105 (CYP 11 B 1), 1. 8 x 102 (CYP 11 B 2), and 6. 3 x 104 (MC 2 R) times higher than nonsteroidogenic fibroblast control. This correlated with urine <b>steroid</b> metabolome <b>profiling</b> showing 2 fivefold increases in the excretion of the metabolites of 11 -deoxycortisol, 21 -deoxycortisol, and total glucocorticoids. Leydig-specific genes were 4. 3 x 101 (LHCGR) and 9. 3 x 100 (HSD 17 B 3) times higher than control, and <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profiling</b> showed twofold increased excretion of the major androgen metabolites androsterone and etiocholanolone. These distinctly increased steroid metabolites were suppressed by dexamethasone but unresponsive to human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation, supporting the role of ACTH, but not luteinizing hormone, in regulating tumor-specific steroid excess. Conclusion: We report bilateral testicular tumors occurring in a patient with recurrent Cushing disease 12 years after bilateral adrenalectomy.

Urinary concentrations of the final metabolic products of the glucocorticoid biosynthetic pathways (11 b-hydroxy-androsterone and 11 b-hydroxy-etiocholanolone, the formerly used as an endogenous reference compound for the gas chromatography–combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry confirmation analysis) were also monitored. Two healthy Caucasian volunteers exhibiting physiologically high testosterone/epitestosterone ratios and elevated concentrations of the main target steroids were selected for the study. Miconazole was administered orally (500 mg/day) for 1 week. Multiple urine samples were collected for 1 week before and during the treatment, and analyzed according to a validated analytical procedure based on gas chromatography–electron ionization-mass spectrometry in selected ion monitoring mode. Our results indicated that oral administration of miconazole decreased the urinary concentrations of androsterone, and to a lesser extent, of etiocholanolone (both detected as the sum of free and glucuronated steroids), and consequently the androsterone/testosterone and androsterone/etiocholanolone ratios. Furthermore, the urinary concentrations of 16 a-hydroxy-etiocholanolone, 16 a-hydroxy-androsterone, 7 b-hydroxy-dehydroepiandrosterone, 6 b-hydroxy-etiocholanolone, 7 a-hydroxy-dehydroepiandrosterone, 6 b-hydroxy-androsterone, 11 b-hydroxy-androsterone, and 11 b-hydroxy-etiocholanolone were significantly suppressed. This evidence suggests the potential intake of miconazole whenever the <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profile</b> is characterized by abnormally low concentrations of the above-mentioned steroids...|$|E
40|$|Autosomal-recessive {{proximal}} spinal muscular atrophies (SMA) are disorders {{characterized by}} a ubiquitous deficiency of the survival of motor neuron protein {{that leads to a}} multisystemic disorder, which mostly affects alpha motor neurons. Disease progression is clinically associated with failure to thrive or weight loss, mainly caused by chewing and swallowing difficulties. Although pancreatic involvement has been described in animal models, systematic endocrinological evaluation of the energy metabolism in humans is lacking. In 43 patients with SMA type I-III (8 type I; 22 type II; 13 type III), aged 0. 6 - 21. 8 years, auxological parameters, pubertal stage, motor function (Motor Function Measurement 32 -MFM 32) as well as levels of leptin, insulin glucose, hemoglobin A 1 c, Homeostasis Model Assessment index and an <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profile</b> were determined. Hyperleptinemia was found in 15 / 35 (43 %) of our patients; 9 / 15 (60 %) of the hyperleptinemic patients were underweight, whereas 1 / 15 (7 %) was obese. Hyperleptinemia was associated with SMA type (p = 0. 018). There was a significant association with decreased motor function (MFM 32 total score in hyperleptinemia 28. 5 %, in normoleptinemia 54. 7 % p = 0. 008, OR 0. 969; 95 %-CI: 0. 946 - 0. 992). In addition, a higher occurrence of hirsutism, premature pubarche and a higher variability of the urinary steroid pattern were found. Hyperleptinemia is highly prevalent in underweight children with SMA and is associated with disease severity and decreased motor function. Neuronal degradation of hypothalamic cells or an increase in fat content by muscle remodeling could be the cause of hyperleptinemia...|$|E
40|$|The steroid module of the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP), {{the newest}} {{innovation}} in doping testing, {{is currently being}} finalized for implementation. Several factors, other than doping, can affect the longitudinal steroid profile. In this study we investigated the effect of hormonal contraceptives {{as well as the}} effect of three polymorphisms on female steroid profiles in relation to doping controls. The study population consisted of 79 female elite athletes between the ages of 18 to 45. Hormonal contraceptives were used by 32 % of the subjects. A full <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profile</b> was obtained using World Anti-Doping Agency accredited methods. In addition all subjects were genotyped for copy number variation of UGT 2 B 17 and SNPs in UGT 2 B 7 and CYP 17. Subjects using hormonal contraceptives excreted 40 % less epitestosterone as compared to non-users (p = 0. 005) but showed no difference in testosterone excretion. When removing individuals homozygous for the deletion in UGT 2 B 17, the testosterone to epitestosterone (T/E) ratio was 29 % higher in the hormonal contraceptives group (p = 0. 016). In agreement with previous findings in men, copy number variation of UGT 2 B 17 had significant effect on female urinary testosterone excretion and therefore also the T/E ratio. Subjects homozygous for the T allele of CYP 17 showed a lower urinary epitestosterone concentration than the other CYP 17 genotypes. It is of great importance that the athlete’s steroidal passport can compensate for all possible normal variability in steroid profiles from women. Therefore, considering the large impact of hormonal contraceptives on female steroid profiles, we suggest that the use of hormonal contraceptives should be a mandatory question on the doping control form...|$|E
40|$|Urine {{samples are}} {{routinely}} used in {{human and animal}} patients to diagnose health problems; often to investigate or monitor specific health-related problems that essentially may remain silent for extended periods. However, not much work has been performed on crocodilian urine for diagnostics. In general, crocodilian species lack a bladder as a separate storage organ (as found in mammals), possess metanephric kidneys (unable to concentrate urine) and have functional salt excreting glands. Collection of urine from the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is a simple and atraumatic procedure where a dog urinary catheter is used to collect relatively clean urine from the urinary chamber in the crocodile’s cloaca. Unfortunately, in-depth investigations of urine variables, and establishing baseline concentrations, have not been performed on Nile crocodile urine samples before. The specific focus areas of this research project were: (1) determination of urine and plasma biochemical concentrations {{by means of a}} standard veterinary clinical pathology profile and the establishment of the ratio between urine and blood biochemical parameters; (2) the validation of a gas chromatographic–mass spectrometric (GC/MS) method for the determination of steroid metabolite concentrations in urine; and (3) using this established analytical method to determine the presence (identify) and concentrations of steroid metabolites in the urine of individual crocodilians. Urine and plasma samples collected at Izintaba Crocodile Farm during the period November 2005 to July 2006, from captive bred, healthy young Nile crocodiles, were analysed for standard biochemistry variables. The urine samples (n = 101) were analysed for sodium, potassium, chloride, urea, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, uric acid, osmolality, and ammonium ion, while the plasma samples (n = 101) were screened for total protein, glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, urea, creatinine, total calcium, ionised calcium, magnesium, phosphate, uric acid and osmolality. Means, medians and standard deviations were statistically determined, as well as urine to plasma (U/P) ratios for corresponding variables. The value of this project is the establishment of reference concentrations for Nile crocodile urine samples that may become useful for interpretation of laboratory results, in future. The clinical validation of a GC/MS method for the analysis of <b>urinary</b> <b>steroids</b> in the Nile crocodile was achieved using urine samples from two-year-old Nile crocodiles. The main objective of this investigation was to develop, optimize and validate the laboratory analysis of <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> metabolites. <b>Steroid</b> <b>profiling</b> was performed on individual and pooled Nile crocodile urine samples. Ascending concentrations of representative steroid standards: androsterone, etiocholanolone, dehydroepiandrosterone, 11 -OH androsterone, pregnanediol, pregnanetriol, 11 -deoxytetrahydrocortisol, tetrahydrocortisone, tetrahydrocortisol and tetra-hydrocorticosterone, were spiked into aliquots of the pooled urine samples, to obtain calibration samples ranging from 0. 2 to 20 μg. Sample preparation and analysis methodology were based on a well-established, validated GC/MS method for determination of human <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> metabolites. The validation of the GC/MS method for Nile crocodile urine was successfully completed, by determining lower limits of quantitation and limits of detection for each analyte, obtaining linearity up to the highest calibration level, correlations exceeding 0. 90, and recoveries of 82 % and more. <b>Steroid</b> <b>profiling</b> was performed on urine samples collected from a number of mature crocodilian species, namely Nile crocodile, American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus) and dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis). Steroid metabolites were identified and were quantitated and reported per urinary creatinine. Qualitative reporting was conducted in cases where creatinine concentrations were not available. Results included identification and quantitation of the steroid metabolites: androsterone, etiocholanolone, 11 -hydroxy androsterone, pregnanediol, pregnanetriol, and the tetrahydro- metabolites of cortisone (THE), cortisol (THF), and corticosterone (THB). In some <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profiles,</b> several prominent peaks were observed which could not be identified. The study findings confirmed that crocodile urine could successfully be used, as it is commonly used in humans, to determine <b>steroid</b> metabolite <b>profiles.</b> A follow-up study to identify the unknown peaks by structure elucidation with more sophisticated equipment is recommended - this could lead to valuable information about liver metabolism of steroids in crocodilians. An adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test was conducted on 18 captive Nile crocodiles. The experimental animals were temporarily housed in separate enclosures at Le Croc Crocodile Farm for four weeks, to ensure controlled conditions and easy and frequent access to the animals. Twenty-seven urine samples were collected both pre- and post-ACTH or saline injections. <b>Steroid</b> <b>profiling</b> was performed on 24 of the 27 urine samples to assess the corticosterone and tetrahydrocorticosterone concentrations following the ACTH treatment. Quantitation relative to urine creatinine levels was recorded following analyses with a standardised liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method, reporting the concentrations in nmol steroid/μmol creatinine. Unfortunately, a significant increase in urinary corticosterone concentrations 6 h after the injection of Synacthen® (5 μg/kg) was not observed. A possible explanation for this could be that the 6 h period was too short for a significant increase in urinary glucocorticoid metabolite excretion in the Nile crocodile. In conclusion, this is the first in-depth study that focused, specifically, on Nile crocodile urine for analyses as diagnostic tools and for indices of health. The screening of the urine samples, collected from healthy Nile crocodiles, for a large array of biochemical variables contributed significantly to the database of “normal” concentrations. The establishment of a validated <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profiling</b> method may significantly contribute to future validation and implementation of innovative diagnostic methods to monitor the health status and endocrine systems of wild Nile crocodiles in Africa.

40|$|Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC) {{is a rare}} {{malignant}} tumour with poor prognosis. Surgical removal is the only cure. Adjuvant use of mitotane, an adrenolytic drug with toxic effects, is controversial at best. We evaluated our treatment program for patients with ACC including active surgery, adjuvant mitotane treatment monitored by serum levels of the drug, and <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profiles</b> in the follow-up to detect early recurrences. Monitoring of serum levels of mitotane made long-term treatment possible in advanced disease with moderate side effects. Repeat surgery for recurrence was valuable in patients with long disease-free intervals, and <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profiles</b> indicated early recurrence in individual patients. The 5 -year survival of 30 consecutive patients with ACC (44 % low Stage and 56 % high Stage tumours) in our series was 64 %. Patients with high Stage ACC (Stage III-IV), treated with mitotane after surgery, seemed to have better prognosis than expected. The results of cytotoxic treatment in advanced disease, using single or multiple cytotoxic agents, have so far been disappointing. Better results were obtained when mitotane was combined with the chemotherapy. Multicenter trials are {{needed in order to}} find the best combined medical therapy for these patients. In order to find histopathological markers that can predict the prognosis in ACC and pheochromocytoma (PC), 87 adrenal tumours were analysed for the expression of cell adhesions molecules by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. Both cortical and medullary adrenal tumours expressed NCAD, NCAM and CD 44, but all tumours were devoid of ECAD. The expression of CD 44 and NCAM did not correlate with the malignant potential of the tumours. During cell transformation and tumour progression NCAD expression seemed to be up-regulated in medullary tumours, but down-regulated in cortical tumours. Loss of NCAD may thus be involved in the development of malignant adrenocortical tumours. Thus, NCAD may function as tumour suppressor and lack of its expression may be of prognostic significance in adrenocortical tumours. PC and paraganglioma (PG) rarely metastasize, but may still be life-threatening due to excessive secretion of catecholamines (CA). The cause of death in untreated PC/PG is hypertensive complications and in rare cases metastatic disease. The overall prognosis after surgical removal of PC has not been studied in detail. In the present study with long-term follow-up (1950 - 1997), 121 consecutive cases of surgically treated PC/PG were reviewed in order to evaluate outcome, cause of death and histopathological features. There was no intra- or post-operative mortality. Eight patients proved to have malignant PC/PG during the period. The number of deaths in the series was higher than expected in the general population (p < 0. 001). The main causes of death were cardiovascular and other tumour diseases. High age at primary surgery and high urinary excretion of methoxy-CA were significant risk factors for death. For comparative reasons, all cases with adrenal PC, diagnosed in Sweden 1958 - 1997, were investigated. Patients in the national cohort had almost 4 times higher risk for death in tumour diseases than the general population, but no elevated death risk for cardiovascular diseases. Life-long follow-up of these patients is important not only to diagnose and treat cardiovascular diseases and recurrent PC at early Stage, but also to diagnose other tumour diseases...|$|R

Pilot studies of the plasma cortisol levels of normal subjects showed a consistent rise in cortisol during alcohol loading under the conditions of the observations, but in hospital patients admitted with acute alcohol intoxication, variability in the experimental conditions masked any consistent changes. Large variations in method reproducibility as well as subject differences affected results from the measurement of 6 βOHF and chloroform extractable 17 -hydroxycorticosteroids in one normal and four alcoholic subjects, rendering apparent initial differences insignificant. The results suggest, but do not demonstrate, that alcohol ingestion may divert normal cortisol metabolism into a pathway leading to the production of 6 βOHF. <b>Urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profiles</b> obtained from two normal subjects, one normal subject under conditions of alcohol load and one alcoholic subject suggest that any effects of alcohol on cortisol metabolism are subtle and would require study {{of a large number of}} cases to define them.

Two other compounds in the urine, 3 beta, 15 beta, 17 -trihydroxy- 5 alpha-pregnan- 20 -one and 3 beta, 15 beta, 17 -trihydroxy- 5 beta-pregnan- 20 -one were also characterized. The {{identification of}} the former 3 steroids was obtained by comparing their methylene unit values and mass spectral data with the corresponding data of the standard steroids synthesized from 15 beta, 17 -dihydroxy- 4 -pregnene- 3, 20 -dione.

40|$|Background: Adrenocortical {{neoplasms}} are classically {{divided into}} adenomas (ACA) and carcinomas (ACC). Heterogeneous appearance and greater size are criteria to suggest malignancy, {{along with the}} <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profile</b> (USP). The presence of regression and myelolipomatous changes in adenomas (ACA-RML) can contribute to confusion with ACC and its USP remains unknown. Objective: To evaluate the features of ACA-RML in comparison with other adrenocortical neoplasms. Design: We selected consecutive ACA (11), ACA-RML (7) and ACC (13) cases for which USP analysis was performed before surgery and tissue was available for histological evaluation (King's College Hospital, 2005 - 2012). Cases were classified according to WHO and Armed Forces Institute of Pathology criteria. USPs were obtained by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Total excretion of individual steroids and indices (sums and ratios chosen to reflect steroid metabolic activity) were compared between ACA-RML, ACA, and ACC. Steroids that {{have proved to be}} useful markers of ACC were also compared empirically between groups, including tetrahydro- 11 -deoxycortisol, pregnene 3, 16, 20 -triols, 16 a- and 21 -hydroxypregnenolone and tetrahydro- 11 -deoxycorticosterone. Results: In comparison with ACA, tumors in ACA-RML were significantly larger (8. 5 ± 2. 4 vs. 3. 5 ± 1. 0, P= 0. 002), presented in older patients and showed relatively higher incidence in males. Mitotic figure counts were significantly lower (0. 39 ± 0. 04 vs. 0. 93 ± 0. 11 in ACA, p= 0. 001) and revealed higher frequency of apoptotic cells (100 % vs. 9 % in ACA, p= 0. 001). The USP of ACA-RML showed no diagnostic features of ACC, along with lower levels of DHA and DHA metabolites. Conclusions: ACA-RML reveals distinctive histological features, and lack of USP markers of malignancy. It is important to recognize ACA-RML because its size and heterogeneous appearance raise the possibility of ACC; in this context, USP is an important tool for a correct preoperative diagnosis.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the plasma and urinary {{cortisol}} (F) and cortisone (E) levels in normotensive and hypertensive pregnant women. The parameters known to reflect the function of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11 β-HSD 2) were calculated to verify the changes in glucocorticoid balance over the course of gestational hypertension (GH) and pre-eclampsia (PE). This retrospective case-control study included women in the third trimester of pregnancy, diagnosed with: GH (n = 29), PE (n = 26), or chronic hypertension (CH; n = 22). Normotensive women in their third trimester of pregnancy were also included (controls; n = 43). The plasma and urinary F and E levels were measured with the HPLC-FLD method. The 11 β-HSD 2 function was estimated by calculating the following ratios: plasma F/E and urinary free F to urinary free E (UFF/UFE). A statistical analysis was performed based on case-control structure. PE was characterized by lower plasma F levels (639. 0 nmol/L), UFF/Cr levels (3. 80 μg/mmol) and F/E ratio (3. 46) compared with that of the controls (811. 7 nmol/L, 6. 28 μg/mmol and 5. 19, respectively) with marked abnormalities observed in the changes of F/E and UFF/UFE ratios with advancing gestation. GH patients showed significant disparities in the <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profile</b> with lower UFF/UFE ratio (0. 330 vs. 0. 401) compared with the normotensive controls and abnormal changes in the UFF/UFE throughout pregnancy. The observed tendency towards lower F/E and UFF/UFE ratios in PE and GH patients may reflect more intensive F metabolism over the course of those disorders. In the normal pregnancy group, the plasma F/E and UFF/UFE ratios tended to present inverse correlations with advancing gestation. This trend was much less marked in PE and GH patients, suggesting that the abnormalities in 11 β-HSD 2 functions progressed with the GA. The birth weights of neonates born from pre-eclamptic pregnancies were lower than those from uncomplicated pregnancies, although only when the babies were born prematurely.

Steroid conjugates were hydrolyzed by enzymes from the digestive juice of the snail, Helix pomatia. Purified urinary organic acid and steroid extracts were methoximated and trimethylsilylated for gas-chromatographic analysis. Urinary acid profiles contained 50 recognizable peaks, 10 of which were unequivocally identified by mass spectral analysis (lactic acid, glycolic acid, sulfate, phosphate, erythronic acid, threonic acid, hippuric acid, citric acid, glucuronic acid, and uric acid). <b>Urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profiles</b> contained 16 recognizable, peaks, although only one peak was identified by mass spectral analysis (pregnanediol). The metabolite profiles were assessed for effects of diet, drugs, and intestinal microflora. Twelve acidic metabolites were excreted in greater amounts by pregnant women compared to nonpregnant women. Four acidic metabolites were excreted in greatly increasing amounts as pregnancy progressed: lactic acid, glycolic acid, the 4 -deoxytetronic acids (only tentatively identified), and erythronic acid. Whereas lactic acid excretion was highly variable, the excretion of glycolic acid, the 4 -deoxytetronic acids, and erythronic acid increased simultaneously. The possible significance of these alterations in the urinary acid profile in pregnancy was discussed. Organic acid excretion in several cases of high-risk pregnancy showed slight deviations from the normal <b>profile.</b> <b>Urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> excretion increased conspicuously as pregnancy progressed.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profiling</b> {{is used in}} doping {{controls}} to detect testosterone abuse. A testosterone over epitestosterone (T/E) ratio exceeding 4. 0 is considered as suspicious of testosterone administration, irrespectively of individual heterogeneous {{factors such as the}} athlete's ethnicity. A deletion polymorphism in the UGT 2 B 17 gene was demonstrated to account for {{a significant part of the}} inter-individual variability in the T/E between Caucasians and Asians. However, the anti-doping strategy includes the determination of carbon isotope ratio on androgen metabolites which has been demonstrated to be reliable for the direct detection of testosterone misuse. Herein, we examined the profiles and the variability in the 13 C/ 12 Cratios of <b>urinary</b> <b>steroids</b> in a widely heterogeneous cohort of professional soccer players residing in different world countries (Argentina, Italy, Japan, South-Africa, Switzerland and Uganda). Aim: The determination of threshold values based on genotype information and diet specific of the ethnicity is expected to enhance significantly the detection of testosterone misuse. Methods: The <b>steroid</b> <b>profile</b> of 57 Africans, 32 Asians, 50 Caucasians and 32 Hispanics was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The carbon isotope ratio of selected androgens in urine specimens were determined by means of gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). Results: Significant differences have been observed between all ethnic groups. After estimation of the prevalence of the UGT 2 B 17 deletion/deletion genotype (African: 22 %; Asian: 81 %; Caucasian: 10 %; Hispanic: 7 %), ethnicspecific thresholds were developed for a specificity of 99 % for the T/E (African: 5. 6; Asian: 3. 8; Caucasian: 5. 7; Hispanic: 5. 8). Italian and Swiss populations recorded an enrichment in 13 C of the <b>urinary</b> <b>steroids</b> with respect to the other groups, thereby supporting consumption of a relatively larger proportion of C 3 plants in their diet. Noteworthy, detection criteria based on the difference in the carbon isotope ratio of androsterone and pregnanediol for each population were well below the established threshold value for positive cases. Conclusion: These profiling results demonstrate that a unique and nonspecific threshold to evidence testosterone misuse is not fit for purpose. In addition, the carbon isotopic ratio from these different diet groups highlight the importance to adapt the criteria for increasing the sensitivity in the detection of exogenous testosterone. In conclusion, it may be emphasized that combining the use of isotope ratio mass spectrometry including refined interpretation criteria for positivity and the subject-based <b>profiling</b> of <b>steroids</b> will most probably improve the efficiency of the confirmatory test...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{effectivity}} of the identification of patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in Hungary in the absence of systematic neonatal screening and to estimate the incidence. Dried blood-spot samples of patients clinically suspected at any age to have CAH were collected between 1978 and 1998 throughout the whole country. 17 -Hydroxyprogesterone (17 -OHP) was measured by radioimmunoassay. Age-specific cut-offs were used. The effectivity of the system was retrospectively assessed. Additional cases were sought to assess the overall incidence of CAH in Hungary. Among the 1, 837 patients investigated, 185 cases of CAH were identified. The overall effectivity was 94. 7 %. The sensitivity and the specificity were 98. 9 % and 94. 2 %, respectively. Salt-wasting (SW) boys were, on average, diagnosed 2 weeks later than SW girls, while both boys and girls with the simple virilising (SV) form were diagnosed at similar ages (2 versus 2. 5 years). An additional 19 cases were diagnosed during the study period using other methods (plasma and <b>urinary</b> <b>steroid</b> <b>profiles</b> without blood-spot 17 -OHP measurements). The incidence of classical CAH in Hungary was 1 : 14, 300 (CI 95 % between 1 : 12, 450 and 1 : 16, 795). Presuming that the incidence of CAH is the same among boys and girls, one can calculate that the diagnosis was missed in 24 boys (2 SW, 22 SV). CONCLUSION: it is possible to identify the vast majority of classical cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia without a neonatal mass screening programme. However, a significant number of boys with the simple virilising form missed whereas both salt-wasting boys and girls are diagnosed safely...|$|R
