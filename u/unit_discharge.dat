40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to clarify the {{function}} of the pontine "pneumotaxic center" with special reference to the axonal projections of the medullary respiratory neurons to the pons. Adult cats were anesthetized with pentobarbital and immobilized with gallamine triethiodide. The <b>unit</b> <b>discharges</b> of respiratory neurons were extracellulary recorded in the pons and medulla. The effects of electrical stimulation of the pons on the discharges of medullary inspiratory neurons and the phrenic nerve were examined. The pattern of the ascending axonal projections and their branches of medullary respiratory neurons (ventral respiratory group, VRG) were systematically explored by antidromic responses to electrical microstimulation of the rostral pons. In addition, the descending projections of the pontine respiratory neurons were examined. To obtain histological evidence of the axonal connections between the pons and medulla, HRP (horseradish peroxidase) or WGA-HRP (wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated HRP) was injected into the VRG where inspiratory <b>unit</b> <b>discharges</b> were recorded and HRP was injected into the rostral pons. The results were as follows: 1) <b>Unit</b> <b>discharges</b> of the phasic type respiratory neurons were recorded in and around the ambigual nucleus and the retrofacial nucleus in the medulla. In the rostral pons, <b>unit</b> <b>discharges</b> of the phasic type and frequency-modulation type neurons were recorded. There was no obvious difference in the localization between the two types of neurons. <b>Unit</b> <b>discharges</b> of the inspiratory neurons were recorded in and around the medial parabrachial nucleus (Pbm). On the other hand, those of the expiratory and phase-spanning neurons were recorded more medially and ventrally. 2) Train pulse stimulation of the lateral edge of the Pbm inhibited the discharges of the medullary inspiratory neuron and the phrenic nerve, as well as switched-off the in?spiratory phase to the expiratory phase when the stimulation was given {{during the second half of}} the inspiratory phase. 3) Six out of 55 (10. 9 %) medullary respiratory neurons examined were found to project to the rostral pons and were considered to have many axonal branchings. On the other hand, only 4 out of 98 (4. 1 %) pontine respiratory neurons examined had axonal projections to the medulla at the obex level and axonal branching was observed in only one neuron. 4) When HRP was injected into Pbm and its surrounding area in the pons, many retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the bilateral ambigual nuclei and their surrounding areas and in the ipsilateral nucleus of the solitary tract. When HRP was injected into VRG, many retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the ipsilateral Kolliker-Fuse nucleus (KF) and lateral parabrachial nucleus. When WGA-HRP was injected into VRG, anterogradely labeled axons, terminal fibers and retrogradely labeled neurons were found mainly in the ipsilateral Pbm and KF.

The most striking change was on the regularity of unit firing in the putamen. Units in the normal putamen exhibited {{a wide range of}} firing rates and variability. In many <b>units</b> <b>discharge</b> rate was very slow. After the lesion, putaminal <b>units</b> <b>discharged</b> in steady spike trains with highly regular patterns of interspike intervals having on average a 63 % reduction in the coefficient of variation. Contrary to expectations, average firing rates actually increased slightly (22 %) from a median value of 4. 88 Hz in controls to 5. 95 Hz in lesioned animals. Although the rates and variability observed in lesioned animals completely overlapped the range of the sample observed in controls, the distributions were shifted such that there were more <b>units</b> with regular <b>discharge</b> patterns and slightly faster firing rates. The caudate nucleus showed no significant change in firing rate or variability. In the globus pallidus, firing rate decreased significantly in the internal segment, and both segments showed an increase in discharge variability.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Motor evoked {{potentials}} (MEPs) and {{inhibition of}} voluntary contraction to {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) of the motor cortex have longer latencies than normal in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) when assessed using surface EMG. This study now examines the modulation of single motor <b>unit</b> <b>discharges</b> to TMS {{with the aim of}} improving resolution of the excitatory and inhibitory responses seen previously in surface EMG recordings.  METHODS—A group of five patients with iSCI (motor level C 4 -C 7) was compared with a group of five healthy control subjects. Single motor <b>unit</b> <b>discharges</b> were recorded with concentric needle electrodes from the first dorsal interosseus muscle during weak voluntary contraction (2 %- 5 % maximum). TMS was applied with a 9 cm circular stimulating coil centred over the vertex. Modulation of single motor <b>unit</b> <b>discharges</b> was assessed using peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs).  RESULTS—Mean (SEM) threshold (expressed as percentage of maximum stimulator output (%MSO)) for the excitatory peak (excitation) or inhibitory trough (inhibition) in the PSTHs was higher (p< 0. 05) in the patients (excitation= 47. 1 (5. 9) %MSO; inhibition= 44. 3 (3. 2) %MSO) than in controls (excitation= 31. 6 (1. 2) %MSO; inhibition= 27. 4 (1. 0) %MSO). Mean latencies of excitation and inhibition were longer (p< 0. 05) in the patients (excitation= 35 (1. 8) ms; inhibition= 47. 1 (1. 8) ms) than in the controls (excitation= 21. 1 (1. 6) ms; inhibition= 27 (0. 4) ms). Furthermore, the latency difference (inhibition−excitation) was longer (p< 0. 05) in the patients (10. 4 (2. 1) ms) than in the controls (6. 2 (0. 6) ms).  CONCLUSION—Increased thresholds and latencies of excitation and inhibition may reflect degraded corticospinal transmission in the spinal cord. However, the relatively greater increase in the latency of inhibition compared with excitation in the patients with iSCI may reflect a weak or absent early component of cortical inhibition. Such a change in cortical inhibition may relate to the restoration of useful motor function after iSCI. ...|$|R

To clarify this inhibitory mechanism, {{the effects of}} HFV on efferent phrenic nerve activity and afferent vagal nerve activity from pulmonary stretch receptors were examined in spontaneously breathing cats. The animals were anesthetized with urethane (440 mg/kg) and chloralose (35 mg/kg). HFV was applied with a piston pump ventilator of a stroke volume of 7 ml. A bias-flow circuit was used and intratracheal pressure {{at the end of}} expiration was adjusted to 2. 0 cm H 2 O. A C 5 branch of the right phrenic nerve was cut for the recording of efferent nerve discharges, which were used as an index for determining inspiratory time(Ti) and expiratory time(Te). Fine strands of ipsilateral cervical vagus were dissected under an operation microscope for recording single <b>unit</b> <b>discharges</b> from the pulmonary stretch receptor. With an application of HFV at 25 Hz, Te increased from 2. 47 ± 1. 09 sec to 3. 53 ± 1. 58 sec, while Ti and peak phrenic nerve activity did not change. Bilateral vagotomy abolished these effects. The <b>unit</b> <b>discharges</b> of 21 slowly adapting stretch receptors (SARs) with a high threshold, 4 SARs with a low threshold and 5 rapidly adapting stretch receptors (RARs) were recorded. In most SAR units, at the time of expiration, the average discharge rate increased whereas it did not change at the time of inspiration. At the time of expiration, SAR <b>units</b> <b>discharged</b> synchronously with air pulses of HFV. In 4 SAR units with a high threshold and 1 SAR unit with a low threshold, there were no observable changes in the average discharge rate at the time of expiration.

These results provide evidence that prolongation of Te during HFV on spontaneous breathing is due to increased afferent <b>discharges</b> of SAR <b>units</b> during HFV...|$|R

The target force was set at either a relatively small (6. 6 ± 3. 7 % maximum) or large (11. 4 ± 4. 5 % maximum) difference below the recruitment threshold force and the contraction was sustained until the motor unit was recruited and discharged action potentials for about 60 s. The time to recruitment was longer for the large target-force difference (P = 0. 001). At recruitment, the motor <b>units</b> <b>discharged</b> repetitively for both target-force differences, which contrasts with data from young adults when motor <b>units</b> <b>discharged</b> intermittently at recruitment for the large difference between recruitment threshold force and target force.

When analyzed across the discharge duration, the average CV for the ISI decreased similarly for the two target-force differences (P = 0. 618) in old adults.
