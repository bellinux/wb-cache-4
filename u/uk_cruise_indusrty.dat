40|$|Key messages: 1. 1 The {{process of}} ocean {{acidification}} is now relatively well-documented {{at the global}} scale as a long-term trend in the open ocean. However, short-term and spatial variability can be high. 1. 2 New datasets made available since Charting Progress 2 {{make it possible to}} greatly improve the characterisation of CO 2 and ocean acidification in UK waters. 3. 1 Recent <b>UK</b> <b>cruise</b> data contribute to large gaps in national and global datasets. 3. 2 The new UK measurements confirm that pH is highly variable, therefore it is important to measure consistently to determine any long term trends. 3. 3 Over the past 30 years, North Sea pH has decreased at 0. 0035 ± 0. 0014 pH units per year. 3. 4 Upper ocean pH values are highest in spring, lowest in autumn. These changes reflect the seasonal cycles in photosynthesis, respiration (decomposition) and water mixing. 3. 5 Carbonate saturation states are minimal in the winter, and lower in 7 more northerly, colder waters. This temperature-dependence could have implications for future warming of the seas. 3. 6 Over the annual cycle, North-west European seas are net sinks of CO 2. However, during late summer to autumn months, some coastal waters may be significant sources. 3. 7 In seasonally-stratified waters, sea-floor organisms naturally experience lower pH and saturation states; they may therefore be more vulnerable to threshold changes. 3. 8 Large pH changes (0. 5 - 1. 0 units) can occur in the top 1 cm of sediment; however, such effects are not well-documented. 3. 9 A coupled forecast model estimates the decrease in pH trend within the North Sea to be - 0. 0036 ± 0. 00034 pH units per year, under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP 8. 5). 3. 10 Seasonal estimates from the forecast model demonstrate areas of the North Sea that are particularly vulnerable to aragonite undersaturation...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the 17 th complete {{occupation of the}} Drake Passage CTD section, established during the World Ocean Circulation Experiment as repeat section SR 1 b. It was first occupied by National Oceanography Centre (previously IOSDL and then SOC) {{in collaboration with the}} British Antarctic Survey in 1993, and has been re-occupied most years since then. Thirty two full depth stations were performed during JR 265 : two test stations, and all 30 of the nominal stations for the SR 1 b Drake Passage section. An initial result is that the estimated total transport measured across the section was 133 Sv which compares well to an average transport measured from the 16 previous <b>UK</b> <b>cruises</b> of 135 Sv (standard deviation of 7 Sv). In conjunction with the hydrographic cruise, a "Waves Aerosol and Gas Exchange Study" (WAGES) intensive observation cruise JR 245 D was also carried out. WAGES involves continuous measurement of the air-sea turbulent fluxes of CO 2, sea spray aerosol, momentum and sensible and latent heat fluxes, plus directional sea-state and whitecap parameters using systems installed on the ship in May 2010. In addition to the continuous measurements, a number of intensive observation periods (IOPs) have been carried out by WAGES staff on board the ship. These involve deployments of a spar buoy to measure wave breaking and an aerial camera system to measure whitecap fraction. The activities of JR 254 D are summarised here, but are described in detail in a separate cruise report. Cruise JR 264 was carried out by NOC-L staff {{at the same time as}} JR 265 and JR 254 D. JR 264 is also the subject of a separate cruise report. The CTD was an underwater SBE 9 plus unit equipped with the following sensors: dual temperature and conductivity sensors, a pressure sensor encased in the SBE underwater unit, a SBE- 43 oxygen probe, an Aquatracka MKIII fluorometer, a transmissometer, an upwardlooking downwelling PAR sensor, and an altimeter. A downward-looking LADCP (RDI Workhorse Monitor 300 kHz) was deployed on all stations. Various underway measurements were obtained, including navigation, VM-ADCP, sea surface temperature and salinity, water depth and various meteorological parameters. A practical aim during this cruise was to update the detailed guides for each of the hydrographic data streams which were first written during JR 195 in 2009. The hydrographic data analysis was performed using "MSTAR", a suite of Matlab programs developed at NOCS by Brian King and used on the JCR for the first time during JR 195...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMarine {{carbonate}} chemistry measurements {{have been}} carried out annually since 2009 during <b>UK</b> research <b>cruises</b> along the Extended Ellett Line (EEL), a hydrographic transect in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. The EEL intersects several water masses that are key to the global thermohaline circulation, and therefore the cruises sample a region in which it is critical to monitor secular physical and biogeochemical changes. We have combined results from these EEL cruises with existing quality-controlled observational data syntheses to produce a hydrographic time series for the EEL from 1981 to 2013. This reveals multidecadal increases in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) throughout the water column, with a near-surface maximum rate of 1. 80 ± 0. 45 μmol kg - 1 yr - 1. Anthropogenic CO 2 accumulation was assessed, using simultaneous changes in apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) and total alkalinity (TA) as proxies for the biogeochemical processes that influence DIC. The stable carbon isotope composition of DIC (δ 13 C DIC) was also determined and used as an independent test of our method. We calculated a volume-integrated anthropogenic CO 2 accumulation rate of 2. 8 ± 0. 4 mg C m - 3 yr - 1 along the EEL, which is about double the global mean. The anthropogenic CO 2 component accounts for only 31 ± 6 % of the total DIC increase. The remainder is derived from increased organic matter remineralization, which we attribute to the lateral redistribution of water masses that accompanies subpolar gyre contraction. Output from a general circulation ecosystem model demonstrates that spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the observations has not significantly biased our multidecadal rate of change calculations and indicates that the EEL observations have been tracking distal changes in the surrounding North Atlantic and Nordic Seas...|$|R

Concentrations of biogenic sulphur compounds were measured on a transect from the eutrophic waters off the coast of Oman to the oligotrophic waters of the open Arabian Sea, during the <b>UK</b> NERC Arabesque <b>cruise</b> 27 August– 4 October 1994. The concentrations of dimethylsulphide (DMS), dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) were found to be elevated in the eutrophic area due to enhanced biological production. However, this increase in DMS, DMSO and DMSP concentration was not observed until after the southwest monsoon had relaxed, and appeared to correspond to increased concentrations of hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin, an indicator of prymnesiophytes. DMSO concentrations were correlated with those of DMS and DMSP in the near surface waters of the Arabian Sea. Additionally, DMSO appeared to be ubiquitous throughout the water column, being easily detectable in deep waters, which suggests that DMSO may act as a sink for DMS in the world’s oceans...|$|R

40|$|RRS James Cook Cruise JC 120 {{was part}} of the Managing Impacts of Deep-seA {{resource}} exploitation (MIDAS) European Union Framework Programme 7 Project. It was jointly funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council. JC 120 was the first <b>UK</b> science <b>cruise</b> to the Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the northern equatorial Pacific, an area likely to be targeted for deep-sea mining for polymetallic nodules. This cruise visited the north easternmost Area of Particular Environmental Importance (APEI). There are a total of nine of these APEIs situated to the north and south of the mining claim areas defined by the International Seabed Authority (ISA) across the CCZ. The APEIs have been delineated by the ISA as part of their environmental management plan for the CCZ and are designed to protect representative species and habitats for the CCZ. The APEIs have been designed based on surface ocean characteristics and the topography of the seafloor, estimated from satellite altimetry. At present there has been virtually no sampling of seafloor habitats or species in the APEIs. The NERC cruise aimed to change that. The cruise studied a representative area of the APEI in great detail at high resolution and over a variety of scales. This characterised the habitats, biology, physical and chemical conditions - adding important information about the CCZ in general and making a detailed baseline assessment for this area, which can be compared to other sites and used as a barometer of change in the deep sea associated with mining activities. The NERC cruise JC 120 used a variety of tools for assessment of this > 4000 m deep area of the CCZ. Shipboard mapping of depth and backscatter were carried out (EM 12). The autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Autosub 6000 carried out wide-area acoustic surveys (Edgetech Side-scan sonar, EM 2040 Multibeam Bathymetry and sub-bottom profiler), collected seabed photographs and made physical measurements of the water column of the APEI. There were also more detailed HD video and photographic surveys of the seafloor using the HyBIS vehicle.

40|$|Due to the {{unprecedented}} {{rate at which}} our climate is changing, the ultimate consequence for many species {{is likely to be}} either extinction or migration to an alternate habitat. Certain species might, however, evolve at a rate that could make them resilient to the effects of a rapidly changing environment. This scenario is most likely to apply to species that have large population sizes and rapid generation times, such that the genetic variation required for adaptive evolution can be readily supplied. Emiliania huxleyi (Lohm.) Hay and Mohler (Prymnesiophyceae) is likely to be such a species as it is the most conspicuous extant calcareous phytoplankton species in our oceans with generation times of 1 day − 1. Here we report on a validated set of microsatellites, in conjunction with the coccolithophore morphology motif genetic marker, to genotype 93 clonal isolates collected from across the world. Of these, 52 came from a single bloom event in the North Sea collected on the D 366 <b>UK</b> Ocean Acidification <b>cruise</b> in June-July 2011. There were 26 multilocus genotypes (MLGs) encountered only once in the North Sea bloom and 8 MLGs encountered twice or up to six times. Each of these repeated MLGs exhibited P sex values of less than 0. 05 indicating each repeated MLG was the product of asexual reproduction and not separate meiotic events. In addition, we show that the two most polymorphic microsatellite loci, EHMS 37 and P 01 E 05, are reporting on regions likely undergoing rapid genetic drift during asexual reproduction. Despite the small sample size, there were many more repeated genotypes than previously reported for other bloom-forming phytoplankton species, including a previously genotyped E. huxleyi bloom event. This study challenges our current assumption that sex is the predominant mode of reproduction during bloom events. Whilst genetic diversity is high amongst extant populations of E. huxleyi, the root cause for this diversity and ultimate fate of these populations still requires further examination. Nonetheless, we show that certain CMM genotypes are found everywhere; while others appear to have a regional bias...|$|R
