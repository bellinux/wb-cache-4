50|$|In 1927, the Aviation Department of the Polish War Ministry {{opened a}} contest for a liaison and {{observation}} plane capable of operating from <b>unprepared</b> <b>airfields,</b> {{in cooperation with}} land Army units. In the PWS factory, Aleksander Grzędzielewski and Augustyn Bobek-Zdaniewski proposed a plane, designated initially P.W.S. 7, the first prototype of which was flown on 28 December 1928 at Biała Podlaska by Franciszek Rutkowski, with the designation changing to P.W.S. 5 in 1929.|$|R
2500|$|In late March 1943, {{the group}} moved to Orlando Army Air Base, Florida, where the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics was headquartered, {{although}} {{each of its}} squadrons was stationed at a different field of the school. [...] In Florida, the group added a fourth unit, the 445th Fighter Squadron, which was activated at Orlando. [...] The dispersed squadrons of the group often operated from <b>unprepared</b> <b>airfields,</b> testing the logistics needed to keep aircraft operating in a theater of operations.|$|R
2500|$|Supported the Italian Campaign during {{balance of}} 1944 {{supporting}} partisans in the Balkans. Its unarmed aircraft flew at night over uncharted territory, landing at small <b>unprepared</b> <b>airfields</b> to provide guns, ammunition, clothing, medical supplies, gasoline, and mail to the partisans. It even carried jeeps and mules as cargo. On return trips it evacuated wounded partisans, evadees and escaped prisoners. It carried paratroopers during the Invasion of Southern France in August 1944. [...] The squadron {{then returned to}} operations over Italy and in the Balkans until end of combat in Europe, May 1945.|$|R

It even carried jeeps and mules as cargo. On return trips it evacuated wounded partisans, evadees and escaped prisoners. These operations earned the squadron the Distinguished Unit Citation. It also dropped paratroopers at Megava, Greece in October 1944 and propaganda leaflets in the Balkans in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations until end of combat in Europe, May 1945.|$|R

5000|$|The light {{multipurpose}} aircraft T-101 [...] "Grach" [...] or [...] "Rook" [...] in English, {{was based}} on the An-2 biplane and planned as a replacement for it. The design is focused on low cost, high reliability, and operating from <b>unprepared</b> <b>airfields.</b> The T-101 can carry 10 passengers, or transport 1600 kg of cargo. It can be used for agricultural, patrol, aerial photography, search and rescue, airborne and other utility functions. The T-101 has a strut-braced high-wing, fixed landing gear with tail wheel and a single engine in the nose.|$|R

50|$|Initial service {{experience}} {{revealed that}} the ShKAS machine guns {{had a tendency to}} jam. This {{was the result of the}} guns being installed in the wings upside-down to facilitate the fit. The problem was addressed in later modifications. Evaluations from pilots confirmed the experience with prototypes. Controls were light and very sensitive, abrupt maneuvers resulted in spins, and spin behavior was excellent. An aileron roll could be performed in under 1.5 seconds (roll rate over 240 degrees/second). The machine guns were fired via a cable and the required effort, coupled with sensitive controls, made precision aiming difficult. The rear weight bias made the I-16 easy to handle on <b>unprepared</b> <b>airfields</b> because the aircraft was rather unlikely to flip over the nose even if the front wheels dug in.|$|R

During {{the spring of}} 1944, the squadron was transferred to 10th Air Force in India where it carried combat cargo during the Siege of Myitkyina, Burma. Returning to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) in July 1944, it carried paratroopers during the Invasion of Southern France in August 1944. The squadron then returned to operations over Italy and in the Balkans until end of combat in Europe, May 1945. In all the 4th earned nine campaign ribbons during operations in both the European and China-Burma-India theaters in the Second World War.|$|R
5|$|The {{origins of}} the An-70 {{can be traced back}} to the mid-1970s, when Antonov Design Bureau began {{preliminary}} design work on a successor for the An-12 twin-engine turboprop aircraft. The Soviet Armed Forces, by the 1980s, were looking for a replacement for the An-12 and a complement to the Ilyushin Il-76 four-engine jet transporter; in 1987, the Ministry of Defence, with a new emphasis on air mobility, specified an aircraft with a quick loading time, the ability to operate from short <b>unprepared</b> <b>airfields,</b> could carry up to 300 troops, and have good operating economy. The initial contract for work on the An-70 was concluded in May 1989; Antonov began advanced design work on the new aircraft during the same year. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in June 1993, the Russian and Ukrainian governments agreed to jointly develop the An-70, with 80percent of the funding expected to come from Russia. The following year, twenty companies and organisations from the former Soviet Union agreed to jointly develop, market and support the aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|At [...] Air Component Hawker Hurricane pilots {{reported}} a German column at Marquion on the Canal du Nord and others further south. Fires {{were seen in}} Cambrai, Douai and Arras which the Luftwaffe had bombed but the Air Component was moving back to bases in England. Communications between the AASF in the south, the Air Component units still in France {{in the north and}} the Air Ministry were disorganised; the squadrons in France had constantly to move bases and operate from <b>unprepared</b> <b>airfields</b> with poor telephone connexions. The AASF was cut off from the BEF and the Air Ministry and England-based squadrons were too far away for close co-operation. Two squadrons of bombers in England reached the column seen earlier at [...] and bombed transport on the Bapaume road, the second squadron finding the road empty. After midday, Georges requested a maximum effort but only one more raid was flown, by two squadrons from [...] around Albert and Doullens. During the night Bomber Command and the AASF flew [...] and lost five bombers.|$|R

5000|$|Coast Guard Air Station Barbers Point is an Air Station of the United States Coast Guard {{located in}} Oahu, of the Hawaiian Islands. Initially the Coast Guard {{established}} a {{base on the}} Hawaiian Archipelago in 1945, {{with a pair of}} PBY-5 Catalinas and one Grumman G-21 Goose. The air unit maintained supervision for the windward side of Oahu. In 1949 the Command moved to Naval Air Station Barbers Point, and in 1965 the unit received its current designation of Coast Guard Air Station Barbers point. For 24 years the Sikorsky HH-52 Seaguard was the primary SAR helicopter, unit 1987 when it was retired and replaced with the Aérospatiale HH-65 Dolphin. The fixed wing component has consisted of various models of the C-130 Hercules which have been assigned to the unit since 1959. Currently the [...] "H" [...] model is in use, and is configured primarily as a search and rescue aircraft. It has the ability to airdrop rescue equipment to survivors at sea or on land. It can take operate from short, <b>unprepared</b> <b>airfields.</b>|$|R
