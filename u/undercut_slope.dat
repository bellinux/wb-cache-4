40|$|One of the {{important}} parameters in <b>undercut</b> <b>slopes</b> design is {{the determination of the}} maximum stable undercut span. The maximum stable undercut span is a function of slope geometry, the strength parameters of the slope material, condition of discontinuities, underground water condition, etc. However, the desired production capacity and therefore the size of excavating equipment will sometimes ask for a wider undercut span. The influence of arching phenomenon in geo-material on the stability of <b>undercut</b> <b>slopes</b> is investigated earlier. It is believed that due to arching effect, some load transfer from the undercut area into stationary remaining side toes leads to a more stable slope. However, the transferred load may result in ploughing failure of side toes. One technique for preventing the ploughing failure is the use of counterweight balance on side toes. In this study, the influence of counterweight size on the stability of the <b>undercut</b> <b>slopes</b> was investigated through a series of numerical model tests using FLAC 3 D software. It was concluded that there is a meaningful relationship between the counterweight balance size and the maximum stable undercut span where increasing a counterweight size results in a wider stable span. Finally, the numerical results were compared with pre-conducted physical modeling test and a nonlinear relationship was proposed between the counterweight size and the maximum stable undercut span...|$|R

40|$|The North Sea Basin {{is shaped}} by {{multiple}} glacial advances and retreats that left complex sequences of glacio-fluvial and sub-glacial deposits, cut by sub-glacial tunnel valleys. Today, the submerged valley of the Elbe forms {{one of the most}} prominent structures of the southern North Sea. Flanked by huge moraine deposits of older glacials, the valley developed to its present form during the Weichselian sea-level lowstand (- 130 m below present). Melt waters that discharged in north-westerly directions along the Scandinavian Ice Sheet fed the paleo Elbe at that time. During the Holocene the valley drowned in the rising sea. Here we present an area-wide high-resolution map of the seafloor and high-resolution shallow seismic data covering 1, 600 km 2 of the paleo Elbe valley (PEV) including its eastern levee. The data allow to shed new light on the PEV development including the historical process of sedimentary infill with the successive Holocene sea level rise in detail. Shallow seismic data with transect distances of 400 m and several cross sections allow 3 -D visualization. The eastern flank of the valley is characterized by a relatively steep slope with one or more terraces. At its levee a significant sediment change is present on the modern sea floor, representing moraine and marine deposits. High resolution sidescan sonar data of this area show a much higher heterogeneity and complexity in sediment and habitat distribution as assumed before. Holocene marine sediments form a patchy and thin drape east of the valley floor. The western slip-off slope of the valley slope is much smoother than the eastern <b>undercut</b> <b>slope.</b> As yet, significant sedimentological changes at the present seafloor are not known for the western side of the PEV. Shallow seismic data show the base of the PEV. There are conspicuous internal seismic reflectors above the base, inclined in northeastern direction. They indicate a sedimentary infill of the valley from the southwest when the southern part of the Dogger Bank was flooded during the early Holocene sea-level rise. In this process the steeper eastern slope acted as a natural barrier towards the northeast and averted sediment transport beyond the eastern boundary of the PEV...|$|E
40|$|Like {{numerous}} torrents in mountainous regions, the Illgraben creek (canton of Wallis, SW Switzerland) produces {{almost every}} year several debris flows. The total {{area of the}} active catchment is only 4. 7 km², but large events ranging from 50 ' 000 to 400 ' 000 m³ are common (Zimmermann 2000). Consequently, the pathway of the main channel often changes suddenly. One single event can for instance fill the whole river bed and dig new several-meters-deep channels somewhere else (Bardou et al. 2003). The quantification of both, the rhythm and the magnitude of these changes, {{is very important to}} assess the variability of the bed's cross section and long profile. These parameters are indispensable for numerical modelling, as they should be considered as initial conditions. To monitor the channel evolution an Optech ILRIS 3 D terrestrial laser scanner (LIDAR) was used. LIDAR permits to make a complete high precision 3 D model of the channel and its surroundings by scanning it from different view points. The 3 D data are treated and interpreted with the software Polyworks from Innovmetric Software Inc. Sequential 3 D models allow for the determination of the variation in the bed's cross section and long profile. These data will afterwards be used to quantify the erosion and the deposition in the torrent reaches. To complete the chronological evolution of the landforms, precise digital terrain models, obtained by high resolution photogrammetry based on old aerial photographs, will be used. A 500 m long section of the Illgraben channel was scanned on 18 th of August 2005 and on 7 th of April 2006. These two data sets permit identifying the changes of the channel that occurred during the winter season. An upcoming scanning campaign in September 2006 will allow for the determination of the changes during this summer. Preliminary results show huge variations in the pathway of the Illgraben channel, as well as important vertical and lateral erosion of the river bed. Here we present the results of a river bank on the left (north-western) flank of the channel (Figure 1). For the August 2005 model the scans from 3 viewpoints were superposed, whereas the April 2006 3 D image was obtained by combining 5 separate scans. The bank was eroded. The bank got eroded essentially on its left part (up to 6. 3 m), where it is hit by the river and the debris flows (Figures 2 and 3). A debris cone has also formed (Figure 3), which suggests that a part of the bank erosion is due to shallow landslides. They probably occur when the river erosion creates an <b>undercut</b> <b>slope.</b> These geometrical data allow for the monitoring of the alluvial dynamics (i. e. aggradation and degradation) on different time scales and the influence of debris flows occurrence on these changes. Finally, the resistance against erosion of the bed's cross section and long profile will be analysed to assess the variability of these two key parameters. This information may then be used in debris flow simulation...|$|E

The frequency of wave height and water level at the shoreline is estimated for eleven sites {{based on a}} 37 -year wind record, estimates of storm surge, offshore wave geometry, nearshore wave transformation, and breaking wave type. Locations experiencing the largest slope recession are not uniformly those with the largest cumulative wave energy; the resistance to erosion of the slope toe must also be accounted for. An index of relative wave strength {{is defined as the}} ratio of wave pressure T and the cohesive strength S of the slope material.

Although internal structures associated with a fluvial origin within valleys such as inner channels, terraces, slip-off and <b>undercut</b> <b>slopes</b> are extremely rare on Mars (Carr and Malin, 2000) such features can be identified in highresolution imagery (e. g. Malin and Edgett, 2001; Jaumann et al., 2005).

This debris provides sediment, which is transported through longshore current for the nearby bay. Joints in the headlands are eroded back to form caves, which erode further to form arches. These gaps eventually collapse and leave tall stacks at the ends of the headlands. Eventually these too are eroded by the waves.|$|R
30|$|It {{was also}} {{observed}} that the landslides are concentrated at the confluence of two streams. As described in the previous section, these landslides are attributed to the <b>undercutting</b> of the <b>slopes</b> associated with gullying. Major factors affecting the initiation of slope failure and subsequent modes of movement appear to be dependent upon the morphology, the nature and degree of weathering of the underlying bedrock, and the moisture status of the loess deposits. Numerous ancillary factors include bedrock-loess interface, slope steepness, vegetation cover, and land utilization. As already noted, the upper surface of the Neogene bedrock is often weathered and contains variable amounts of smectites. In this zone, wetting-drying results in a progressive decrease in strength that may ultimately lead to <b>slope</b> failure. <b>Undercutting</b> of the <b>slopes</b> along the gullies is frequent, which {{increases the risk of}} slope failure. As a result of the high relative relief, the steep slopes and the relatively uniform geological and geomorphological conditions, the landslides tend to be very large and to occur in groups.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, {{failures}} are triggered as {{a result}} of <b>undercutting</b> of the <b>slope</b> by a river, especially during a flood.

For example, in Nepal this process is often seen after a glacial lake outburst flood, when toe erosion occurs along the channel. Immediately after the passage of flood waves extensive landsliding often occurs. This instability can continue to occur for a long time afterwards, especially during subsequent periods of heavy rain and flood events.|$|R

Though a worldwide issue, landslides remain enigmatic especially with regards to their geometry, causative factors, triggering mechanisms, relationship between triggering factors and landslide occurrence, and the susceptibility of any area to mass wasting phenomena. This thesis presents an inventory and thorough analysis of small–scale devastating landslides that occurred in recent years around the city of Limbe {{at the base of}} Mt Cameroon. A multidisciplinary approach was adopted {{in order to understand the}} complex and multi-phase nature of landslide processes. This involved integrating results of traditional field mapping, rainfall measurements, analyses of geotechnical properties, soil mineralogy and geochemistry to get an idea of the processes and mechanisms involved in landslide initiation and mobilisation. From these results, two conceptual models are proposed to explain the occurrence of landslides affecting areas populated by vulnerable people. The thesis thus provides first-hand field-measured geometric characteristics of landslide scars and systematically documents and quantifies for the first time the overall features of volume-limited devastating slides around Limbe. Hence, it provides constraints for modelling, monitoring and remediation efforts that might be applied in other areas affected by similar small-scale failures. Field observations, geotechnical and mineralogical characterisation suggests that slope failure within the study area is enhanced by human intervention through anarchical construction and <b>slope</b> <b>undercutting</b> whereas natural <b>slope</b> failure is generated as a result of fracture enhanced permeability. This implies that in the absence of external factors the slopes within the study area would generally remain stable for long periods. It also demonstrates that understanding landslide triggering processes and relationships between triggers and slide occurrence could be improved through more accurate recording of landslide events and the corresponding triggering process (intensity, magnitude and duration). This knowlegde can be used in landslide susceptibility assessment which was one of the most significant achievements of this thesis, and in the development of early-warning systems that might enable a reduction in the number of casualties and economic loss from future landslide phenomena. The findings from the present study have generic value and can be used to tackle small-scale slope instability problems elsewhere in the subtropics...|$|R

Prior to assessing the landslide hazard, a detailed landslide inventory map is fundamental. This study documents the landslides on the northwest Loess Plateau with high accuracy using high-resolution Quickbird imagery for landslide inventory mapping in the Changshou valley of Baoji city. By far the majority of landslides are in loess, representing small-scale planar sliding. Most of the large-scale landslides involve loess and bedrock, and the failure planes occurred either along the contacts between fluvial deposits and Neogene argillites, or partially within the bedrock. In the sliding zones of a large scale landslide, linear striations and fractures of the soils were clearly developed, clay minerals were oriented in the same direction and microorganism growths were present. From the analysis of microstructure of sliding soils, it is concluded that the Zhuyuan landslide can be reactivated if either new or recurring water seepage is caused in the sliding surface.

Given the current land pressure with increasing occupation of steep uplands, landslide hazards are expected to increase in the near future. Understanding the factors that control landslide hazards is therefore essential. Rare event logistic regression allows us to perform a robust detection of landslide controlling factors. This technique is here applied to the tropical Andes to evaluate the impact of dynamic land cover changes on landslide occurrences. Land cover change trajectories (i. e. dynamic evolution of land cover through time) were specifically included in the probabilistic landslide analysis. While natural physical processes such as <b>slope</b> <b>undercutting</b> by rivers and failure of oversteepened slopes are important in this tropical mountainous site, landslides are increasingly associated with human activities. The data show that land cover trajectories are associated with landslide patterns. In this humid mountainous site, forest degradation {{does not lead to}} a measurable increase in landslide occurrence. However, few years after forests are converted to pastures, a rapid decline of slope stability is observed. Land cover conversion from forest to pasture permanently reduces slope stability.

40|$|With its smaller size, {{well-known}} boundary conditions, and {{the availability}} of detailed bathymetric data, Lake Geneva's subaquatic canyon in the Rhone Delta is an excellent analogue to understand sedimentary processes in deep-water submarine channels. A multidisciplinary research effort was undertaken to unravel the sediment dynamics in the active canyon. This approach included innovative coring using the Russian MIR submersibles, in situ geotechnical tests, and geophysical, sedimentological, geochemical and radiometric analysis techniques. The canyon floor/levee complex is characterized by a classic turbiditic system with frequent spillover events. Sedimentary evolution in the active canyon is controlled by a complex interplay between erosion and sedimentation processes. In situ profiling of sediment strength in the upper layer was tested using a dynamic penetrometer and suggests that erosion is the governing mechanism in the proximal canyon floor while sedimentation dominates in the levee structure. Sedimentation rates progressively decrease down-channel along the levee structure, with accumulation exceeding 2. 6 cm/year in the proximal levee. A decrease in the frequency of turbidites upwards along the canyon wall suggests a progressive confinement of the flow through time. The multi-proxy methodology has also enabled a qualitative slope-stability assessment in the levee structure. The rapid sediment loading, <b>slope</b> <b>undercutting</b> and over-steepening, and increased pore pressure due to high methane concentrations hint at a potential instability of the proximal levees. Furthermore, discrete sandy intervals show very high methane concentrations and low shear strength and thus could correspond to potentially weak layers prone to scarp failures...|$|R

The most common landslides were shallow disrupted landslides on steep slopes without geologic preference, but deep, coherent landslides also occurred in many locations. We studied about 100 deep, coherent landslides by field investigation and by interpretation of aerial photographs {{and found that}} many of them had occurred due to the reactivation of previous landslides. These had planar sliding surfaces along bedding planes or along oxidation fronts. Planar, bedding-parallel sliding surfaces were exposed or inferred from the geometry of the deformed ground surface, such as "horsts and grabens " and "roll-over antiform". The bedding-parallel sliding surfaces were made at the boundary between the overlying sandstone and underlying siltstone or along the bedding planes of the alternated beds of sandstone and siltstone. Sliding surfaces along the oxidation front were made in the area of black mudstone. New landslides (rockslide-avalanches) occurred within the sliding surfaces in tuff bands of a few-cm thickness that were interbedded in the siltstone. Most of the deep landslides occurred on <b>slopes</b> <b>undercut</b> by erosion or artificial excavation, whether they were reactivated or new ones.

The impact of natural hillslope processes {{is important and}} is currently strongly influenced by human activity due to land use change and vegetation removal, and is becoming even greater due to climate change. Both the fundamentals of erosion and slope stability are discussed in this chapter with respect to processes, causes and impacts. To fully appreciate the role of vegetation in the remediation of adverse slope processes, the fundamentals of these slope processes are addressed. In the first part, the role of mass movements is discussed. The definitions used and physical principles underlying mass movements are explained and keys and diagnostic parameters are given to explain how to recognize certain types of mass movements in the field. The causes of mass movement are described, amongst which deforestation, adverse hydrological conditions or <b>slope</b> <b>undercutting,</b> are summarized. The main types of mass movements i. e. falls, slides and flows are then separately discussed, giving full details {{with regard to their}} causes, processes and consequences, as well as a first glimpse to the solutions to slope failure problems, which will be addressed in more detail elsewhere in the book. The second part addresses erosion processes. Accelerated erosion is considered {{as one of the greatest}} problems of land degradation as it removes the fertile topsoil at high rates. Mankind, who is removing the original vegetation for agricultural purposes, is causing this problem.

The short-term (yearly and weekly) dynamics of mass-wasting processes were studied in a cm-scale using repetitive topographic scanning. We monitored several active sites on the forelands of two glaciers, Ebbabreen and Ragnarbreen, both of which are located near Petuniabukta at the northern end of Billefjorden in Spitsbergen. The surveys indicate high dynamic rates of landforms' transformation. The mean annual volume loss of sediments and dead-ice for the most active parts of the moraines was up to 1. 8 m a− 1. However, most of the transformation occurred during summer, with the short-term values of mean elevation changes as high as − 104 mm day− 1. In comparison, the dynamics of the other (i. e. non-active) parts of the ice-cored moraines were much lower, namely, the mean annual lowering (attributed mainly to dead-ice downwasting) was up to 0. 3 m a − 1, whereas lowering during summer was up to 8 mm day− 1. Our results indicate {{that in the case of}} the studied glaciers, backwasting was much more effective than downwasting in terms of landscape transformation in the glacier forelands. However, despite the high activity of localised mass movement processes, the overall short-term dynamics of ice-cored moraines for the studied glaciers were relatively low.

The results are summarized as follows: 1. The Da-Pang landslide is an arc-shape creep type. The causes are the risingwater table by infiltrated rainfall that increased the pore-water pressure, steep topography and road construction. The site is in the Neogene Middle Miocene Da- Pang (Nankuang F.) Formation mainly made up of mud shale and calcareous siltstone. The rock-forming mineral contents of mud shale include sericite, quartz, calcite, that of calcareous siltstone include quartz, calcite, sericite and feldspar. 2. The Ta-Tou landslide, another arc-shape type creep, are caused by road construction, concentrated runoff, steep slope due to gully head erosion, and increased pore-water pressure due to increased subsurface moisture and poor drainage. The site is located at Neogene Late Miocene Nanchuang Formation with calcarenite and calcilutide minerals include quartz, calcite, sericite, feldspar and quartz, sericite calcite. 3. Mao-Pu-Tse landslide is also an arc-shape type failure. It was caused by <b>undercutting</b> of <b>slope</b> by fluctuating reservoir water levels and liquefaction of slopeland submerged in water over long period of time. The Neogene Late Miocene Kueichulin (Ta-Wo sandstone member) Formation at the site is composed of siltstone and fine greywacke. Its minerals include quartz, sericite, feldspar. 4.

40|$|The {{ability to}} control and {{manipulate}} the state of polarisation of optical signals is becoming an increasingly desirable feature in numerous applications including integrated optical circuits, semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) and optical communication systems. This thesis introduces the design, optimisation, fabrication and operation of two novel integrated reciprocal single-section passive polarisation converter devices based upon mode-beating. The converter designs consist of asymmetric profiled waveguides, which were realised in a single reactive ion dry-etch process step. An in-situ custom built sample holder was utilised to place the samples at a predetermined angle to the incoming ions, which resulted in waveguide profiles with sloped sidewalls. This fabrication technique also allowed the incorporation of adiabatic taper sections within the device design. The converter section waveguide profile of the first design consists of two sloped sidewalls. Devices realised on a GaAs/AlGaAs material structure achieved a converted transverse magnetic (TM) polarisation purity of 81. 4 % at a device length of 30 μm for a transverse electric (TE) polarised input signal at an operating wavelength of λ = 1064 nm. The convention used is that TE refers to light polarised in {{the plane of the}} wafer and TM refers to light polarised perpendicular to the plane of the wafer. The total optical loss imposed by this device was evaluated to be 1. 72 dB. This design was also used for the monolithic integration of a passive polarisation converter incorporated within a Fabry-Perot semiconductor laser diode on an unstrained GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum well heterostructure material system. A predominantly TM polarised optical output from the converter facet of greater than 80 % is demonstrated for a converter length of 20 μm at an emitting wavelength of 867. 1 nm. The about 1. 4 mm long fabricated device has a current threshold level of 100 mA and a side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of 25 dB. The second converter design is based on the modification of an already existing stripe waveguide structure. The converter section is defined by applying the above mentioned angled dry-etch process on a certain length of the stripe waveguide. The fabricated asymmetric waveguide core profile consists of a <b>sloped</b> <b>undercut.</b> A TM polarisation purity of 90 % at a device length of 55 μm for a TE polarised input signal at an operating wavelength of λ = 1064 nm was achieved at the output. The total optical loss imposed by this device was evaluated to be 0. 47 dB. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The Coronet Peak and Arthurs Point Landslides {{have both}} formed in schist bedrock on the northwestern {{side of the}} Wakatipu Basin. The rock masses at both sites show {{evidence}} {{for the presence of}} many defects, such as foliation, schistosity, foliation shears, sheared and crushed zones, faults and joints, all which have formed {{as a result of the}} deformation and metamorphism the schist has undergone. The Arthurs Point Landslide has a volume of 2. 4 x 10 ⁷m³, and is a wedge failure, with sliding occurring along the intersection of two master joint sets rather than foliation, the latter dipping into the slope. It is a retrogressive failure, with the eastern part having failed as a consequence of <b>undercutting</b> of the <b>slope</b> during the Last (Otiran) Glaciation. Actual failure of the eastern segment occurred after retreat of the ice left the valley sides over steepened and unsupported, whilst failure of the western part was related to the rock above the initial failure being left unsupported and incision of the Shotover River. The Coronet Peak landslide is a translational planar slide with a volume of approximately 1 x 10 ⁹m³ that failed along foliation and/or foliation shears, and the slide can be divided into zones (Zone A and B), based on morphological evidence. Zone A is the larger zone (it has a volume of 6 x 10 ⁸m), and has well-developed hummocky topography, indicating continued but slow movement (probably less than 2 - 5 mm/yr) as it has no form of toe support removal. Initial failure of the Coronet Peak landslide was triggered by ice undercutting and subsequent retreat of the Wakatipu Basin, most probably during the Waimean Glaciation (approx 135 000 years ago), as it was during this ice advance that the Wakatipu Glacier extended all the way into the Wakatipu Basin and partially up the Shotover and Arrow Valleys. Zone B can be divided into three subzones, which are all different reactivations. Zone B 1 is a reactivated part of the Coronet Peak landslide and was triggered by the ice erosion related to the Otiran Glaciation. Evidence for this is seen on the valley floor at the toe of Coronet Peak landslide, with the Old Ben Lomond moraine situated adjacent to the end of the reactivated part. Most surficial glacial deposits in the Wakatipu Basin are related to the Otiran advance. Zone B 2 is a reactivation within this, and was triggered by incision of the Shotover River. Zone B 3 consists of two reactivations, both possibly related to flood events of the Shotover River. Back analysis of the Coronet Peak Landslide were performed, to ascertain whether the model used for the landslide is appropriate. The results showed that the model is a reasonable one. It is feasible to build on the Arthurs Point and Coronet Peak landslides, as long as it is not at the usual densities. With landslide debris, the foundation materials are not always compacted well, and therefore injudicious excavation could cause reactivations, like at the Coronet Plaza, where trimming a small amount of rock off the toe of the CPL to allow room for extensions caused some of the toe area to reactivate. The other important factor when building on landslides is surface and subsurface water, as more water in the slope than normal will increase the instability. Building at the usual densities would increase the area being excavated, and so the disruption to the foundation materials, and it would increase the amount of water to be controlled...|$|R
