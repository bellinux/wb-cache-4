5|$|<b>Under</b> <b>Section</b> 8, the Secretary of State {{could pass}} a {{statutory}} instrument setting out {{the rules and}} limits surrounding compensation for the employee's dismissal after making a protected disclosure; until this is done, Section 9 provided interim remedies, which {{were the same as}} in other cases of unfair dismissal. The Secretary of State did pass such an instrument, the Public Interest Disclosure (Compensation) Regulations 1999, but Section 8 has now been repealed <b>under</b> <b>Section</b> 44 of the Employment Relations Act 1999. <b>Under</b> <b>Section</b> 10, the Act applies to crown servants, excepting <b>under</b> <b>Section</b> 11, those who are employees of MI5, MI6 or GCHQ. The Act does exclude, in Sections 12 and 13, serving police officers and those employed outside the United Kingdom.|$|E

A small number of separate statutory offences have been created to cover attempts concerning individual summary offences, in which case, usual attempt law and procedure applies.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{suggested}} that, in {{the light}} of Chng Suan Tze, the validity of an order for preventive detention made by the Minister <b>under</b> <b>section</b> 30 of the CLTPA is dependent on the objective satisfaction of the Minister. Moreover, in Re Wong Sin Yee (2007), which also involved judicial review of an applicant's detention <b>under</b> <b>section</b> 30 of the CLTPA, the High Court, following the decision in Chng Suan Tze, held that the absence of the need to establish a jurisdictional or precedent fact meant that the scope of judicial review as regards the exercise of the Minister's discretion <b>under</b> <b>section</b> 30 was limited to the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. The Court thus applied an objective test to the subjectively worded powers in section 30; if it Court had applied a subjective test, it would have deferred to the subjective satisfaction of the Minister that the detention was in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.|$|E
5|$|The appellants were Jehovah's Witnesses. On 2 July 1992, police seized {{publications}} from them, thirteen {{of which}} turned out to be publications prohibited under Order 123.

5|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the Charity Commission is concurrent {{with that of the}} High Court of Justice. The High Court possesses all the powers of the Commission, who only exercise theirs on application of the charity or Attorney General, or trustees, beneficiaries and interested people when the charity has an income of less than Â£500. The Commission, <b>under</b> <b>Section</b> 29 of the 2011 Act, also keeps the register of charities. <b>Under</b> <b>Section</b> 110 of the Act, the Commission is tasked with giving advice or opinions to trustees relating to the performance or administration of their charity.

5|$|A more narrow bail-in process {{pertaining}} to federal observer certification is prescribed in Section 3(a).

5|$|Before {{a person}} can be {{detained}} under the ISA, the President must be satisfied that such detention {{is necessary for the}} purposes of national security or public order. This is a precondition for the valid exercise by the Minister for Home Affairs of the power to order the detention. The detention order is supplemented by section 74 of the ISA which empowers the police to arrest and detain any person pending enquiries without a warrant <b>under</b> <b>section</b> 8.|$|E
5|$|Food stamps {{have been}} issued in the United States since World War II, but the program did not include Puerto Rico until the early 1970s, when U.S. Public Laws 91-671 of January 11, 1971 and 93-86 of November 1, 1974 {{partially}} extended the Food Stamp Program to U.S. territories.

5|$|If an {{employee}} does {{make such a}} disclosure, Section 2 inserts a new Section 47B, providing that the employee shall suffer no detriment in their employment as a result. This includes both negative actions {{and the absence of}} action, and as such covers discipline, dismissal, or failing to gain a pay rise or access to facilities which would otherwise have been provided. If {{an employee}} does suffer a detriment, he is permitted to make a complaint before an employment tribunal <b>under</b> <b>Section</b> 3. In front of an employment tribunal, the law is amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation, and to reverse the burden of proof; if an employee has been dismissed for making a protected disclosure, this dismissal is automatically considered unfair. Similarly, <b>under</b> <b>Section</b> 6, an employee cannot be given priority when discussing redundancies simply because he made such a disclosure. These sections take into account Section 7, which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before they come into effect.|$|E
5|$|If {{someone is}} {{found guilty of}} an attempt, they are sentenced <b>under</b> <b>section</b> 4(1) of the 1981 Act.
