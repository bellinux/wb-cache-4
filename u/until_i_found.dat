2500|$|Thomas Figures, a black Assistant U.S. Attorney, {{testified that}} Sessions {{said he thought}} the Ku Klux Klan was [...] "OK <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out they smoked pot". Sessions later said that the comment was not serious, but did {{apologize}} for it, saying that he considered the Klan to be [...] "a force for hatred and bigotry". Barry Kowalski, a prosecutor in the civil rights division, also heard the remark and testified that prosecutors working such a gruesome case sometimes [...] "resort to operating room humor and that is what I considered it to be". Another DOJ lawyer, Albert Glenn, said, [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was any seriousness to it." [...] Figures testified that on one occasion, when the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division sent the office instructions to investigate a case that Sessions had tried to close, Figures and Sessions [...] "had a very spirited discussion regarding how the Hodge case should then be handled; in the course of that argument, Mr. Sessions threw the file on a table, and remarked, 'I wish I could decline on all of them, by which Figures said Sessions meant civil rights cases generally. Kowalski, however, testified that he believed [...] " [...] was eager to see that justice was done in the area of criminal civil rights prosecutions." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No. Officially, I {{have nothing}} to do with it. <b>Until</b> <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> that last link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish must think I am working for her husband, not against him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, father, {{nothing of}} the sort. But there must be women {{somewhere in the world}} who are neither pink nor white, and I tell you, once for all, that I will never marry <b>until</b> <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> one exactly to my taste.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{know that}} he came through Braster, and he asked for me. He looked {{in through the window}} of my cottage when Colonel Ray was with me. I saw him no more after that <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> him dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Lady Ermyntrude's bracelet! My grandfather's cup!" [...] he cried. [...] "I {{would have}} died ere I lost them! What can I say to her? I dare not return <b>until</b> <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> them. Oh, Aylward, Aylward! how came you to let them be taken?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{lie down}} now," [...] {{said the old}} man, [...] "and try to sleep. Early to-morrow, {{as soon as it}} is light, I shall take what food I can carry and {{continue}} the search <b>until</b> <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> Jane. <b>I</b> will not return without her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do need you. It's lucky I {{have such}} a partner. I've got to make {{restitution}} and can't do so at my proper cost. Yet I've no claim; I cheated you, as I cheated my wife.

60|$|Next I {{heard the}} bags of gold being {{removed from the}} boat, after which we walked away, guards {{supporting}} me by either elbow <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> my strength again, and Houman following just behind, perhaps because he feared my foot if he went in front.|$|E
5000|$|... "For {{this fine}} scheme to work," [...] Houseman wrote, [...] "there was one {{essential}} condition — {{that the quality}} of these 'classical' productions be exceptionally high.

60|$|But Dan {{would not}} be content <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> the board and cleaned the knives to his {{complete}} satisfaction.

60|$|Had Perry been dead, I should gladly have pitted my {{strength}} and wit against the savage and primordial {{world in which}} <b>I</b> <b>found</b> myself. <b>I</b> could have lived in seclusion within some rocky cave <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> the means to outfit myself with the crude weapons of the Stone Age, and then set out in search of her whose image had now become the constant companion of my waking hours, and the central and beloved figure of my dreams.|$|R

6000|$|The sudden {{lowering}} {{of his voice}} in this confession--as if it had represented a sort of darkening of his consciousness--again amused me. [...] "You too? How then we've been occupied!

6000|$|... "What matter, {{so long as}} we go together?" [...] she {{answered}} in a gay voice that yet seemed to ring untrue, [...] "although," [...] she added, with a little choke of the throat, [...] "I would that we could have stayed here <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> and buried my father.

5000|$|Carcathiocerta (Կարկաթիոկերտ, Karkatiokert or Արկաթիակերտ, Arkatiakert.

6000|$|... "If {{you could}} only have sprinted a little and kept ahead, we would either have outflanked them or have had the finest imaginable ride with every chance of running the fellows down.

60|$|He wished me good-night, {{and held}} up his light. I walked {{by the side of}} the down Line of rails (with a very disagreeable {{sensation}} of a train coming behind me) <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> the path.

60|$|We alighted under a portico {{where there}} was a great bustle and a great crowd, but I do not {{distinctly}} remember further details, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> myself mounting a majestic staircase wide and easy of ascent, deeply and softly carpeted with crimson, leading up to great doors closed solemnly, and whose panels were also crimson-clothed.|$|E
6000|$|... 579. ~till I had found~. The {{language}} is extremely condensed here, the meaning being, 'I began my flight, {{and continued to}} run till <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> you'; the pluperfect tense is used because the speaker is looking back upon his meeting with the brothers after completing a long narration of the circumstances {{that led up to}} it. If, however, 'had found' be regarded as a subjunctive, the meaning is, 'I began my flight, and determined to continue it <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> (i.e. should have found) you.' Comp. Abbott § 361.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{not give}} up the hunt <b>until</b> <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> her." [...] He turned again to the cavalrymen.

60|$|No {{sooner had}} the truth flashed upon me than the {{realization}} came that I must seek some {{other means of}} reaching the village, for to pass unobserved through this well-traveled thoroughfare would be impossible.

60|$|This, however, I {{would not}} do <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> my agent was really culpable.

6000|$|I {{had some}} {{difficulty}} in shoving through the crowd; I {{can still remember}} very vividly being jammed at one time between two big men so that my arms were pinned to my sides, but all the other details are gone {{out of my mind}} <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> myself almost violently projected forward into the [...] "scrap." ...|$|E
60|$|Here I fired my revolver. The echo boomed {{out like}} the report of heavy artillery, but no {{answering}} shot rewarded me. There was no alternative save to wander along the canyon and through the cedars <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> my companions. This I began to do, disgusted with my awkwardness in losing them. Turning Foxie westward I had scarcely gotten under way when Don came trotting toward me.|$|E
60|$|Unfortunately, as {{it turned}} out, I had not {{mentioned}} to the superintendent my own possession of a duplicate Wulfric; nor had I called Mactavish's {{attention to the fact}} that I had pulled a coin of my own for purposes of comparison out of my waistcoat pocket. To say the truth, I was inclined to be a little secretive as yet about my gold Wulfric, because <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> out all that was known about it I did not want anybody else to be told of my discovery.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it's no fancy; I am {{sure of what}} I say. To my mind, that Danish man's {{likeness}} to my lord is (if {{you will}} excuse my language) a nasty circumstance.

"I {{have the}} wildest desire," [...] he said, [...] "to {{know what is}} in the earth under our place, and if it should so happen in the course of time that the limits of earthly {{existence}} should be reached by--I mean if the estate should come into my hands--I would go down, down, down, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> out all that could be discovered.
