500|$|Lansbury was {{a talented}} politician, speaker, and organizer. What made him {{remarkable}} was the stubbornness {{with which he}} clung to his principles... {{became one of the}} best-loved and most-respected figures in the labour movement. Lansbury's legacy has been the adamantine insistence among an element within the Labour Party that Britain must stand for moral principles, must set the world a moral example. Concretely, this has meant demanding the total abolition of capitalism and <b>unilateral</b> <b>disarmament,</b> policies that Labour's leaders have usually thought utopian or worse.|$|E
500|$|The small Labour {{group in}} {{parliament}} had little influence over economic policy; Lansbury's term as leader {{was dominated by}} foreign affairs and disarmament, and by policy disagreements within the Labour movement. The official party position was based on collective security [...] through the League of Nations and on multilateral disarmament. Lansbury, supported {{by many in the}} PLP, adopted a position of Christian pacifism, [...] <b>unilateral</b> <b>disarmament</b> and the dismantling of the British Empire. Under his influence the party's 1933 conference passed resolutions calling for the [...] "total disarmament of all nations", and pledged to take no part in war. Pacifism became temporarily popular in the country; on 9 February 1933 the Oxford Union voted by 275 to 153 that it would [...] "in no circumstances fight for its King and Country", and the Fulham East by-election in October 1933 was easily won by a [...] Labour candidate committed to full disarmament. [...] Lansbury sent a message to the constituency in his position as Labour Leader: [...] "I would close every recruiting station, disband the Army and disarm the Air Force. I would abolish the whole dreadful equipment of war and say to the world: “Do your worst”." [...] October 1934 saw the emergence of the Peace Pledge Union; the 1934–35 Peace Ballot, an unofficial public [...] referendum, produced massive majorities against war. Meanwhile, Adolf Hitler had come to power in Germany, and had withdrawn from the international Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Blythe observes that Britain's noisy flirtations with pacifism [...] "drowned out the sounds from German dockyards", as German rearmament began.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Mus, who {{had lived}} {{for many years in}} Vietnam, met with Ho Chi Minh at the Viet Minh {{headquarters}} in Thai Nguyen [...] north of Hanoi. [...] Mus proposed a cease fire and a <b>unilateral</b> <b>disarmament</b> by the Viet Minh. Ho said he would be a coward to accept such terms. [...] This was Ho's last meeting with a representative of the French government.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout her {{political}} career, Halonen has described herself as supporter of international solidarity. She {{describes herself as}} a [...] "relative pacifist", meaning that she doesn't support <b>unilateral</b> <b>disarmament.</b> She has strongly defended the President's role as {{the commander in chief}} of the military. She opposes NATO membership. Her strong stands on these issues have characterised her presidential term and shaped Finnish foreign policy, in part in cooperation with the like-minded former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Erkki Tuomioja.|$|E
2500|$|Gaitskell's Labour party ceased {{supporting}} {{an independent}} deterrent in 1960 via its new [...] "Policy for Peace", after {{the cancellation of}} Blue Streak made nuclear independence less likely. Labour also adopted a resolution favoring <b>unilateral</b> <b>disarmament.</b> Although Gaitskell opposed the resolution and it was reversed in 1961 in favor of continuing support of a general Western nuclear deterrent, the party's opposition to a British deterrent remained and became more prominent. This became a campaign issue during the 1964 general election. Alec Douglas-Home's incumbent Conservatives stated that the British deterrent was both necessary for independence from the Americans and maintaining British world influence, and was [...] "working for peace" [...] in such cases as {{the passage of the}} Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Led by Gaitskell's successor Harold Wilson, Labour emphasized domestic economic issues but called deterrence the [...] "Tory Nuclear Pretense" [...] which would be neither independent nor effective. The populace's greater interest in domestic over foreign policy likely contributed to Labour's victory.|$|E
5000|$|A peace {{walk from}} San Francisco, USA to Moscow, USSR took place from December 1960 to October 1961. [...] The walk was {{organized}} by Committee for Nonviolent Action and promoted nonviolence and <b>unilateral</b> nuclear <b>disarmament.</b>|$|R

50|$|Nations do {{not often}} choose to {{dismantle}} their entire military capability. <b>Unilateral</b> <b>disarmament</b> is usually sought in one technical competency, such as {{weapons of mass}} destruction. Non-violent political movements from that of Mahatma Gandhi to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament have recommended <b>unilateral</b> <b>disarmament</b> as a step toward world peace.|$|E

50|$|Davies {{served in}} a number of posts when Labour formed the Official Opposition after the {{election}} of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, including Shadow Secretary of State for Wales in Michael Foot's Shadow Cabinet and Shadow Secretary of State for Defence in Neil Kinnock's. Like his predecessor as Shadow Defence Secretary, John Silkin, he resigned from the front bench in June 1988 in protest at Neil Kinnock's management style. The trigger for his resignation was Kinnock's announcement, without reference to Davies or the Shadow Cabinet, of a change in Labour's defence policy, from <b>unilateral</b> nuclear <b>disarmament</b> to multilateral nuclear disarmament and then back to <b>unilateral</b> nuclear <b>disarmament,</b> over a period of three days. He made an unsuccessful bid for the Labour Party deputy leadership in 1983.|$|R
