40|$|In one of {{our earlier}} works, we {{proposed}} to approximate Pareto fronts to multiobjective optimization problems by two-sided approximations, one from inside and another from outside of the feasible objective set, called, respectively, lower <b>shell</b> and <b>upper</b> <b>shell.</b> We worked there {{under the assumption that}} for a given problem an <b>upper</b> <b>shell</b> exists. As it is not always the case, in this paper we give some sufficient conditions for the existence of <b>upper</b> <b>shells.</b> We also investigate how to constructively search infeasible sets to derive <b>upper</b> <b>shells.</b> We approach this issue by means of problem relaxations. We formally show that under certain conditions some subsets of lower shells to relaxed multiobjective optimization problems are <b>upper</b> <b>shells</b> in the respective unrelaxed problems. Results presented are illustrated by a numerical example representing a~small but real mechanical problem. Practical implications of the results are discussed.
