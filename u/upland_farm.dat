25|$|With {{the start}} of World War II, the Isle of Man was chosen {{as a base for}} {{internment}} camps for enemy aliens. After a short time the rules of detention were relaxed for those internees who posed no threat to the Allies, enabling them to be utilised for work in local Manx farms. Posted to the Douglas' family farm at Ballaragh were a party of Italians from a camp on the promenade at Douglas, amongst them Leonida Nikolai Giovannelli. After Giovannelli's eventual release from internment, he and Douglas ran an experimental <b>upland</b> <b>farm</b> at the Clarum, close to Douglas' parents' farm. After six years of operation, the farm had to be sold to meet rising debts in 1949. This part of their lives was recorded in Giovannelli's books, Experiments on a Manx Hill Farm (1956) and Exile on an Island (1969). By this time Douglas' father had died and when her mother also passed on, in 1953, she inherited 'Thie ny Garee', and she would later expand this to also run the Clarum.|$|E

40|$|In the Tokachi District {{there has}} been an {{astonishing}} increase in the development of large-scale <b>upland</b> <b>farming,</b> especially in the peripheral areas where agricultural production capacity is lower. Recently, {{there has been}} an increase in number of <b>upland</b> <b>farms</b> that are more than 50 hectares in size. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to illustrate the potential problems associated with expanding the scale of <b>upland</b> <b>farms.</b> The study examined four upland farmers in the Tokachi District. 1) The proportion of cultivated crops relative to farm size has steadily declined in the last ten years. By changing work procedures it is possible to maintain current <b>upland</b> <b>farming</b> land use patterns and the crop rotation system for farms up to 50 hectares in size. When farms reach 70 hectares in size, however, it is very difficult to maintain the crop rotation system without changing work procedures and the combination of cultivated crops. If changes are not made the farmer is forced to perform work at less than optimal times. Expanding <b>upland</b> <b>farming</b> scale to 70 hectares, without a technical foundation, will cause a decrease in land productivity. 2) Enlarging farm size while maintaining the crop rotation system requires an increase in fixed capital expenditures. This in turn raises depreciation costs. The depreciation costs for a 70 -hectare farm are especially high and the depreciation costs per hectare cannot be reduced. In short, economies of scale do not exist in large-scale <b>upland</b> <b>farming.</b> This suggests that fixed machinery costs will not decrease with an increase in farm size. 3) Enlarging farm size, up to 50 hectares, in peripheral areas clearly increases farm income, but at 70 hectares, because of a decrease in land productivity and an increase in depreciation costs, farm income is severely restricted. At 70 hectares the efficiency of farm management decreases and both income ratio and income per acre falls...|$|R

[...] [Footnote: Odyssey, IX. 391-393.] He is not using iron to make a sword or spear, but a tool-adze or axe. The poet is perfectly consistent. There are also examples both of bronze axes and, apparently, of bronze knives. Thus, though the woodcutter's or carpenter's axe is of bronze in two passages cited, iron is the usual material of the axe or adze.

60|$|Finally, {{to go back}} to its disadvantages, {{the village}} is waterless; at all events in summer, when water is most wanted. Water is such a blessing and joy in a village--a joy for ever when it flows {{throughout}} the year, as at Nether Stowey and Winsford and Bourton-on-the-Water, to mention but three of all those happy villages in the land which are known to most of us! What man on coming to such places and watching the rushing, sparkling, foaming torrent by day and listening to its splashing, gurgling sounds by night, does not resolve that he will live in no village that has not a perennial stream in it! This unblessed, high and dry village has nothing but the winter bourne which gives it its name; a sort of surname common to a score or two of villages in Wiltshire, Dorset, Somerset, and Hants. Here the bed of the stream lies by the bank {{on one side of the}} village street, and when the autumn and early winter rains have fallen abundantly, the hidden reservoirs within the chalk hills are filled to overflowing; then the water finds its way out and fills the dry old channel and sometimes turns the whole street into a rushing river, to the immense joy of the village children. They are like ducks, hatched and reared at some <b>upland</b> <b>farm</b> where there was not even a muddy pool to dibble in. For a season (the wet one) the village women have water at their own doors and can go out and dip pails in it as often as they want. When spring comes it is still flowing merrily, trying to make you believe that it is going to flow for ever; beautiful, green water-loving plants and grasses spring up and flourish along the roadside, and you may see comfrey and water forget-me-not in flower. Pools, too, have been formed in some deep, hollow places; they are fringed with tall grasses, whitened over with bloom of water-crowfoot, and poa grass grows up from the bottom to spread its green tresses over the surface. Better still, by and by a couple of stray moorhens make their appearance in the pool--strange birds, coloured glossy olive-brown, slashed with white, with splendid scarlet and yellow beaks! If by some strange chance a shining blue kingfisher were to appear it could not create a greater excitement. So much attention do they receive that the poor strangers have no peace of their lives. It is a happy time for the children, and a good time for the busy housewife, who has all the water she wants for cooking and washing and cleaning--she may now dash as many pailfuls over her brick floors as she likes. Then the clear, swift current begins to diminish, and scarcely have you had time to notice the change than it is altogether gone! The women must go back to the well and let the bucket down, and laboriously turn and turn the handle of the windlass till it mounts to the top again. The pretty moist, green herbage, the graceful grasses, quickly wither away; dust and straws and rubbish from the road lie in the dry channel, and by and by it is filled with a summer growth of dock and loveless nettles which no child may touch with impunity.|$|E

The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to explore some of the experiences of farmers involved a rewilding project to emphasise the importance of fully appreciating, collaborating and recognising how <b>upland</b> <b>farming</b> systems operate and their wider socio-economic benefits.

40|$|In Hokkaido, the {{large-scale}} <b>upland</b> <b>farming</b> {{crop rotation system}} is in disorder, so its effect on land productivity is cause for concern. Therefore,the usefulness of fallow green manure cropping is pointed out. But, {{from the fact that}} it is a non commodity crop, positioning in regard to crop selection farmers is low. So, bidding which is directed to its fixation is necessary. In this paper, we will explore the elucidation of introduction fixation conditions of fallow green manure cropping in large-scale <b>upland</b> <b>farming.</b> The focus of this paper, Sarabetsu village in the Tokachi region, is a typical example of largescale <b>upland</b> <b>farming.</b> First, frequency and continuity of fallow green manure cropping of <b>upland</b> <b>farming</b> were rearranged. As a result, we can see that similar types such as "continuation" "discontinuance" "non continuation", clearly showing the differences in cropping conduct. Second, based on field investigations, the primary factors of introduction fixation of fallow green manure cropping are made clear; 1) The recognition of improvements for the crop rotation system, 2) The necessity of guaranteeing a yearly gross income, and, 3) Present scale and existence of scale enlargement conditions. Third, the crop selection of large-scale <b>upland</b> <b>farming,</b> making use of linear programming, was modeled and appraised. When obedience of the crop rotation system is designated as a purpose, fallow green manure cropping selection occurred according to the area. It was selected in the 5 - 10 % of the total area when it was present. Fourth, comparison of the profitability with fallow green manure cropping was conducted. Although it caused profit decreases, the cost decreased to a greater degree. Furthermore, per area income showed the fact that there is little overall difference. From the results above, 3 points were given as a fallow green manure introduction fixation conditions. First, introduction makes farm working adjustments possible, making the obedience of crop rotation possible. Under present conditions, recognition of the management for wheat repeated cultivation has influenced fallow green manure cropping introduction. Because of that, recognition improvement of the problems which occur with repeated cultivation is necessary. Second, it is important to consider,as clearly shown by analysis, that fallow green manure cropping does not always reduce profits, but that its overall impact is negligible. Third, it is large-scale farming with which fallow green manure cropping introduction has rationality, and the introduction ratio is 5 - 10 % of the cropping acreage. It is also necessary for such bidding to be done.

40|$|Sense {{of place}} can be {{described}} as the distinctiveness of a place for people, whether they are the local population or transients (see earlier chapters in this book). Typical aspects of the concept include: natural and man-made features; heritage, culture and traditions; and produce and industries developed {{as a result of that}} place. The idea of geographical place has received extensive attention by geographers (see the review by Castree 2004) where structures, processes and networks are perceived as important. In other disciplines the psychological lived experience of place is also signiﬁcant (Hay 1998). By combining both these approaches, sense of place can be used as a practical rural regeneration tool to aid struggling communities. This has been enthusiastically embraced by many farming businesses seeking to diversify their farm incomes (eg Bessière 1998; Robinson 2004); <b>upland</b> <b>farming</b> communities are no exception.
