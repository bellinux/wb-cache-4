50|$|Most {{processes}} {{have employed}} two-bearing screens. Two- bearing circular vibrating screens with a screen box weight of 35 kN {{and speed of}} 1200 RPM were common. The centroid axis of the screen box and <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> does not change during rotation.|$|E
50|$|In a {{three-phase}} linear circuit {{with three}} identical resistive or reactive loads, the neutral carries no current. The neutral carries current if the loads on each phase are not identical. In some jurisdictions, the neutral {{is allowed to}} be reduced in size if no unbalanced current flow is expected. If the neutral is smaller than the phase conductors, it can be overloaded if a large <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> occurs.|$|E

30|$|The {{experimental}} {{results in the}} present study demonstrate the significant role of transverse frames in the redistribution of <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loads</b> resulting from a column removal scenario. With RC moment frames, a consideration of the redistribution of <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loads</b> in all directions leads to more economical and precise design.|$|R
30|$|During an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loading</b> condition, {{there is}} the {{presence}} of negative sequence voltage and line currents, but unlike a fault condition, they are small in magnitude. A case of <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loading</b> is taken at Bus 1 in the WSCC nine bus system (discussed in Table 4), where the magnitudes of negative sequence components of all the bus voltage phasors (V 1 −, V 2 −, V 3 −, V 4 −, V 5 −, V 6 −, V 7 −, V 8 − and V 9 −) are all greater than zero. Due to a limitation in space, these values are not presented in Table 4. This condition indicates the presence of <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loading</b> or a fault condition. Next, the magnitudes of negative sequence components of the line current phasors are also obtained as: I 14 −[*]=[*] 0.01 kA, I 27 −[*]=[*] 0.01 kA and I 93 −[*]=[*] 0.01 kA, I 46 −[*]=[*] 0.01 kA, I 54 −[*]=[*] 0.01 kA, I 69 −[*]=[*] 0.01 kA, I 78 −[*]=[*] 0.01 kA, I 75 −[*]=[*] 0.01 kA and I 98 −[*]=[*] 0.01 kA. It is observed that the maximum magnitude of the negative sequence component (0.01 kA) is less than the threshold value (τi). This condition is therefore detected as an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loading</b> (not a fault condition).|$|R
50|$|Rope locks are cam-actuated devices {{through which}} a {{counterweight}} system operating line passes. The adjustable cam, or dog, inside the rope lock constricts and releases the operating line as the flyman lowers and raises a hand lever. Rope locks are mounted in series to the locking rail. A single rope lock can typically secure a static <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> to 50 lb. Rope locks {{are not intended}} to slow a running line.|$|E
50|$|The (nearly direct) {{currents}} induced {{in these}} lines from geomagnetic storms are harmful to electrical transmission equipment, especially transformers - inducing core saturation, constraining their performance (as well as tripping various safety devices), and causing coils and cores to heat up. In extreme cases, this heat can disable or destroy them, even inducing {{a chain reaction}} that can overload transformers. Most generators {{are connected to the}} grid via transformers, isolating them from the induced currents on the grid, making them much less susceptible to damage due to geomagnetically induced current. However, a transformer that is subjected to this will act as an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> to the generator, causing negative sequence current in the stator and consequently rotor heating.|$|E
50|$|Dead-end towers {{are used}} at regular {{intervals}} in a long transmission line to limit the cascading tower failures that might occur after a conductor failure. An in-line dead-end tower will have two sets of strain insulators supporting the lines in either direction, with the lines connected by a jumper between the two segments. Dead-end towers can resist unbalanced forces due to line weight and tension, contrasted with suspension towers which mostly just support the conductor weight and have relatively low capacity for <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load.</b> Dead-end towers may use earth anchor cables {{to compensate for the}} asymmetric attachment of the conductors. They are often used when the power line must cross a large gap, such as a railway line, river, or valley.|$|E

30|$|IR_LAT_i {{represents}} the load current and rated load current of lateral respectively. This objective function {{is used to}} determine the degree of <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loading</b> of laterals, therefore, less value of λ 5 (s) is preferred.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Assessing {{the impact}} of load {{asymmetry}} of turbogenerator (TG) on the magnetic field distribution, on the electrical and energy processes in it based on the numerical-field analysis within the constraints regulated by the standards. Methodology. The calculation model of TG has been constructed on the method of symmetrical components of the three-phase current system. The formed asymmetric system of the currents is used for multi-position numerical calculations of rotating magnetic fields. The temporal functions of the electromagnetic quantities which are subjected to the harmonic analysis are obtained on this basis. Results. Test calculations are conducted on a three-phase 35 MW TG during his work under autonomous <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loading.</b> The analysis of the temporal functions of the magnetic induction at different points of the TG stator and also similar functions of the magnetic flux linkage, EMF phase stator windings and other variables have been executed. Originality. Problems of exploitation of turbo-generators under <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loading</b> are detected by the consideration of their electromagnetic system on the whole, but not their simplified local parts, as usual. It {{has been shown that}} the temporal functions of EMF of the phase stator windings under <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loading</b> significantly differ in shape from sine waves and from each other and contain a number of significant upper harmonics. It has been detected that the phase currents would contain not only the first but also significant upper harmonics under <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loading.</b> Practical value. Analysis of the work of TG under <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loading</b> showed the «top» level of problems of electromagnetic character. It has been established that the function of the magnetic induction at the fixed points of the magnetic system on the whole have been changed but not in principle. The temporal functions of EMF, and, hence, the voltage of the stator phase windings significantly differ in shape from sine waves and from each other, there is a considerable imbalance of active powers generated by the individual phase windings of the stator. The information provided will allow the measures to ensure a durable and reliable operation of turbo-generators...|$|R
50|$|On August 4, 2009, Benson's second album, <b>Unbalanced</b> <b>Load,</b> was {{released}} by Comedy Central Records. His third album, Hypocritical Oaf {{was released}} on August 31, 2010. Benson aims to record a new album every April 20 (with a subsequent summer release date) for as many consecutive years as possible. Benson's fourth album, Potty Mouth, was released on August 29, 2011. The pattern continued {{with the release of}} his fifth album, Smug Life, which was released on July 3, 2012, and Gateway Doug, his sixth album, released on July 9, 2013. On July 8, 2014, Doug released a sequel to Gateway Doug entitled Gateway Doug 2: Forced Fun. His latest album release is Promotional Tool which came out on June 9, 2015.|$|E
50|$|Spunky's Dangerous Day {{is played}} as a {{two-dimensional}} side-scrolling platform game, and the player controls Rocko. There are {{four sets of}} stages in which Rocko's dog Spunky has wandered {{off in search of}} an object that catches his attention: Sand in Your Navel (set at the beach), Trash-O-Madness (set at the dump), Ice Scream (set in O-Town itself), and <b>Unbalanced</b> <b>Load</b> (set in the laundromat), and each individual stage consists of four different levels. Except for Ice Scream all of the levels were based on episodes of the show. Rocko's goal in every level is to keep Spunky safe from danger. This means activating platforms and switches at specific times, as well as feeding Spunky certain items and defeating enemies in the way.|$|E
5000|$|In either case, {{the process}} and {{techniques}} used {{are very similar to}} those developed prior to the era of motor vehicles. Customers arrange for a meeting time or a delivery time and drop their goods and supplies at the pack station. Packing services are charged by the pound or by the animal, typically with a minimum price depending on the distance from the pack station. Everything is weighed, sorted for each animal, then split 50/50 to get a balanced load {{on each side of the}} animal; an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> will cause the saddle to slide to the heavy side, causing discomfort to the animal, and potentially inviting disaster. The average mule can carry as much as 300 lb. A mammoth donkey can carry up to 200 lb and standard donkey limit is 125 lb. However, most pack station mule loads are limited to 150 lb ...|$|E
30|$|Therefore, all the negative-sequence {{currents}} {{consumed by}} <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loads</b> are {{supplied by the}} ESS inverter. The negative-sequence voltage across the line impedance Z o due to the negative-sequence current can be eliminated. The voltage of MG can maintained as three-phase balanced.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} Instantaneous Reactive Power (IRP) theory {{is applied to}} develop an {{improved}} modulation method for Matrix Converters (MCs) operating with <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loads.</b> IRP theory shows that, for <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loading</b> conditions, the instantaneous power contains a constant component and a component that fluctuates at twice the fundamental frequency. In conventional modulation schemes the power fluctuation results in input current harmonics. The new method removes the harmonic distortion by synthesizing an input current vector that contains positive and negative sequence components that satisfy the power balance requirements but have only fundamental frequency components. The paper shows that the conventional modulation method may be converted to produce the required input current vector by phase modulation of the input current vector...|$|R
40|$|The main {{challenge}} {{associated with}} the grid-connected inverter (GCI) in distributed generation systems is keeping the harmonic content of the output current below the specified value and compensating for <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loads</b> even when the grid is subject to disturbances such as harmonic distortion and <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loads.</b> To overcome these challenges, a current control strategy for a three-phase GCI under <b>unbalanced</b> and nonlinear <b>load</b> conditions is presented. The proposed control method enables the GCI to inject balanced and clean currents to the grid even when the local <b>loads</b> are <b>unbalanced</b> and/or nonlinear; it also compensates for the harmonic currents and controls the active and reactive powers. The main advantage and objective of this method is to effectively compensate for the harmonic current content of the grid current and microgrid {{without the use of}} any compensation devices such as active, passive and LCL filters...|$|R
5000|$|The {{advantage}} of two-phase electrical power over single-phase {{was that it}} allowed for simple, self-starting electric motors. In {{the early days of}} electrical engineering, it was easier to analyze and design two-phase systems where the phases were completely separated. It was not until the invention of the method of symmetrical components in 1918 that polyphase power systems had a convenient mathematical tool for describing <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> cases. The revolving magnetic field produced with a two-phase system allowed electric motors to provide torque from zero motor speed, which was not possible with a single-phase induction motor (without an additional starting means.) Induction motors designed for two-phase operation use a similar winding configuration as capacitor start single-phase motors (however, in a two-phase induction motor, the impedances of the two windings are identical, whereas in a single-phase induction motor, the impedances can be, and usually are, quite different, to reduce cost without sacrificing starting performance; indeed, some single-phase capacitor start/capacitor run induction motors have superior starting characteristics when compared to two- or three-phase induction motors.) ...|$|E

40|$|A delta-connected STATCOM with cascade {{multilevel}} full H-bridge (FHB) converter {{has been}} applied for phase balancing and power factor correction of <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> in a three-phase, three-wire power distribution system. In this paper, a feedforward compensation formula is presented for the STATCOM by using the symmetrical components method to compensate <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load.</b> Computer simulation is performed for preliminary verification. Accordingly, a hardware prototype employing a TMS 320 F 2812 DSP-based system is built for final verification test. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed STATCOM is very effective for real-time <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> compensation...|$|E

The proposed control topology relies on a combination between a voltage source inverter (VSI) and a dump load (DL). The VSI imposes the system frequency and performs the unbalances compensation, while the DL deals with the voltage regulation. Experiments have yielded the reliability of this configuration during generator <b>loading</b> and <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loads</b> supply...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} master {{thesis is}} to derive {{a model of the}} {{induction}} machine that drives the washing machine drum, a model for the drum with an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> and to derive a controller for the induction machine. In addition to the models, it should also be investigated if the currents, drawn by the induction machine, will vary with the <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load.</b> Finally it should be investigated if it is possible to determine the mass of the <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> simply by looking at the stator currents. A vector control drive consisting of a current and a speed PI-controller have been derived and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink. Two controllers have been derived, one equipped with a flux estimator for speed sensored control and the other with a flux and speed estimator for sensorless control. The induction machine model and the model for the washing drum with <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> have been verified to work as intended.

40|$|A new {{solution}} for <b>unbalanced</b> and nonlinear <b>loads</b> {{in terms of}} power circuit topology and controller structure is proposed in this paper. A three-phase four-wire high-frequency ac-link inverter is adopted to cater to such loads. Use of high-frequency transformer results in compact and light-weight systems. The fourth wire is taken out from {{the midpoint of the}} isolation transformer {{in order to avoid the}} necessity of an extra leg. This makes the converter suitable for <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loads</b> and eliminates the requirements of bulky capacitor in half-bridge inverter. The closed-loop control is carried out in stationary reference frame using proportional + multiresonant controller (three separate resonant controller for fundamental, fifth and seventh harmonic components). The limitations on improving steady-state response of harmonic resonance controllers is investigated and mitigated using a lead-lag compensator. The proposed voltage controller is used along with an inner current loop to ensure excellent performance of the power converter. Simulation studies and experimental results with 1 kVA prototype under nonlinear and <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loading</b> conditions validate the proposed scheme...|$|R

40|$|Three phase 3 -leg {{inverters}} are {{the most}} common interfaces for forming distributed generation and microgrids. However, in low voltage systems, loads are often 3 -phase, 4 -wire with frequent unbalances. The question of unbalanced loads on stand-alone microgrids can be handled in two ways. First, <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> compensators can be provided near each <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load.</b> Second, unbalanced loads can be fed by 4 -leg inverter interfaces with a 4 -wire microgrid. This paper is concernedwith the second approach. The design of closed-loop system for 4 -leg inverter interface for microgrid with unbalanced loads is carried out. Detailed analysis of power flow dynamics and stability for a 3 -phase, 4 -wire microgrid with 4 -leg inverters catering to unbalanced loads is reported. The analysis is supported by simulations and laboratory experiments. The proposed microgrid shows stable operation andmaintains balanced voltages at <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> terminals without any load compensators...|$|E
40|$|The AHU (air handler unit) {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{research}} objects in HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) system containing coils, blower wheel, heater, etc. Most of the high efficiency blower wheels are driven by BLDC (brushless DC) motor. This paper mainly focuses on two severe problems in blower wheel, namely airflow blockage and <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> of fan motor. Early diagnosis of these problems decreases energy consumption in HVAC system significantly. Condition monitoring method applied to both the stator current and stray flux is utilized in <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> condition in a BLDC motor. The fundamental frequency and second harmonics of stray flux are analyzed as indicators under unbalance load condition. The discrimination between airflow blockage and <b>unbalanced</b> <b>load</b> based on stator spectrum analysis is also discussed in this paper.

40|$|The {{effects of}} unbalances caused by untrasposed EHV {{transmission}} lines and <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loads</b> in power system analysis have been thoroughly analyzed and determined;In the steady-state analysis, {{it is concluded}} that three-phase representation {{of the system is}} necessary and the unbalance analysis needs to be performed at least once under specific system conditions to ensure a safe and normal operation of the system. The newly developed method is proved to be an efficient approach to be used in this type of analysis;In the electromagnetic transient analysis, it is concluded that untransposed transmission lines have no significant impact on the transient overvoltages caused by single line-to-ground fault clearing and, therefore, may be represented fully transposed. It is noted, on the other hand, that <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loads</b> can affect the transients and must be included in the analysis.

40|$|In recent years, {{renewable}} energy sources have been considered the most encouraging resources for grid and off-grid power generation. This paper presents an improved current control strategy for a three-phase photovoltaic grid-connected inverter (GCI) under <b>unbalanced</b> and nonlinear <b>load</b> conditions. It is challenging to suppress the harmonic content in the output current below a pre-set value in the GCI. It is also difficult to compensate for <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loads</b> even when the grid is under disruption due to total harmonic distortion (THD) and <b>unbalanced</b> <b>loads.</b> The primary advantage and objective of this method is to effectively compensate for the harmonic current content of the grid current and microgrid {{without the use of}} any compensation devices, such as active and passive filters. This method leads to a very low THD in both the GCI currents and the current exchanged with the grid. The control approach is designed to control the active and reactive power and harmonic current compensation, and it also corrects the system unbalance. The proposed control method features the synchronous reference frame (SRF) method. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effective performance of the proposed method...|$|R
