Using evidence gathered through students 2 ̆ 7 voluntary self-assessment of their performance with respect to assessment tasks in two different disciplines at two Australian universities, the paper focuses on the effects <b>of</b> sequences <b>of</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> {{and the use of}} different types of assessment task (written, oral, analysis, and project) in the development of student judgement. Convergence between student criteria-based gradings of their own performance in <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> and those allocated by tutors was analysed to explore the calibration of students 2 ̆ 7 judgement over time. First, it seeks to replicate analyses from an earlier smaller-scale study to confirm that students 2 ̆ 7 judgements can be calibrated through continuing opportunities for selfassessment and feedback. Second, it extends the analysis to coherently designed sequences <b>of</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> and explores the effects of different types of assessment. It finds that disruptive patterns of assessment within a sequence of subjects can reduce convergence between student and tutor judgements...|$|R

Therefore, 'efficacy' here means 'the degree to which the teaching and learning activities supported the development of the learning outcomes'.|$|E
