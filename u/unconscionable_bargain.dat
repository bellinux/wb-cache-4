In relation to {{the claim that the}} hat there was an <b>unconscionable</b> <b>bargain,</b> and the claim that the bargain was procured by undue influence, Wells J held the Amdios did not understand the guarantee nor the financial predicament of the company, and if they had, they would not have given the guarantee. On the part of the bank, [...] "if the bank officers had known that the plaintiffs had so imperfect an understanding of the principal document and its legal consequences, and of the circumstances giving rise to its application, as they had, what was actually done by those officers would have fallen short of what the law required of them in the special circumstances." [...] His Honour held that any hardship, or inequality of bargaining power, was unknown to the bank and the transaction was not uncsoncionable.|$|E
5000|$|The Privy Council {{advised that}} the {{contract}} was not an <b>unconscionable</b> <b>bargain.</b> With regards to the trust's claim, the Court said {{the contract was}} unfair in equity if one party is insane and the other party is not aware of this, the contract can be set aside due to insanity if the contract was deemed to be [...] "unfair". However, the court said there were two types of [...] "unfair" [...] contracts: [...] "procedural unfairness", where a benefit is obtained through undue influence, i.e., victimisation, and [...] "contractual imbalance", where one party gets a more favourable outcome than the other party, i.e., a bargain. For such a contract to be set aside for unfairness, the second party had to be active in obtaining an unfair contract. In this case the Privy Council held that Mr. Harts conduct was [...] "beyond reproach", emphasising {{that most of the}} sale terms and conditions were proposed by the trust's own solicitor, which Mr Hart merely accepted.|$|E

5000|$|Historically the {{doctrine}} had predominantly been invoked where {{the person who}} is exercising undue influence over another person either enters into a contract with the affected person or receives a gift from them. However, much of the recent case law relates to three party cases, where one person (often a husband) exerts undue influence on a second person (the wife) to enter into a transaction (providing a guarantee or security for the husband's debts) with a third party (often a bank). The doctrine originally developed because of perceived limitations in the law relating to duress. Although the modern law is different, previously in order to set aside a contract for duress it was necessary to show a threat of violence to the person (this is now no longer the case), and {{the doctrine}} developed in response to more subtle forms of coercion. [...] Accordingly, many earlier cases which refer to undue influence are capable of being reconsidered as actually relating to duress or <b>unconscionable</b> <b>bargains</b> in the modern sense.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} examine the {{structure}} of the defendant-sided unjust factors, by which I mean duress and undue influence. The paper first argues that undue influence is based on abuse of deferential trust placed in the defendant and duress on an illegitimate threat leading to the claimant's lack of consent. The paper distinguishes undue influence from the <b>unconscionable</b> <b>bargains</b> doctrine. The paper then models the effect of that on the claimant's intentional agency by reference to Michael Bratman's influential theory of intention. It suggests that while mistake can be modelled by way of the failure of a condition on his intention, meaning that the claimant's intention does not cover the facts as they actually turn out to be, defendant-sided factors are based on the defendant's having improperly inveigled himself into the claimant's practical reasoning. It suggests that this happens either by way of the defendant's illegitimate structuring of the claimant's choice or by way of the claimant's deferring his judgment to that of the defendant. The claimant's intentions have, in philosophical language, agential authority, but the claimant was ‘in the grip of a norm’; the essay explores what this concept might be...|$|R
40|$|A brief {{examination}} {{of the history of}} the guarantee reveals that equity treated the guarantor as a favoured debtor, given the absence of real benefit to the guarantor. However, these protections have largely been removed by standard form guarantee contracts used by, credit providers, and the law is also otherwise deficient in protecting consumer guarantors. As the expansion of the use of credit in recent years has meant that guarantees are now sometimes given carelessly and thoughtlessly, by persons without adequate education and resources to protect their interests, regulation is required (Chapter 1). The statutory regulation of guarantees before the passing of the Credit Act was inadequate. After examining the scope and nature of the Credit Act, the effect of the Credit Act on the regulation of guarantees is examined (Chapter 2). The extent to which the common law and statute law regulate pre-contractual information given to guarantors is then examined. It is concluded that room for improvement exists (Chapter 3). The extent to which the common law and statute law regulate the exercise of undue influence, unfair pressure and the making of <b>unconscionable</b> <b>bargains</b> is then examined and it is concluded that developments will occur rapidly in this area (Chapter 4). Common law and statutory provisions which discharge the guarantor from liability are then examined in the light of the operation of the Credit Act and it is concluded that some flaws exist both in principle and in the operation of the law (Chapter 5). The extent to which the guarantor is entitled to control the appropriation of payments made by the debtor, and the extent to which the guarantor's liability is coextensive with that of the debtor is then examined and some changes suggested (Chapter 6). The guarantor's rights to have action taken first against the debtor and the debtor's assets, the guarantor's rights to notice before action, and the right of indemnification after action, are then examined (Chapter 7). The possible reasons for the non-regulation of guarantees are examined and dismissed; past suggestions for reform and possible future reforms are examined (Chapter 8). Standard form contracts of guarantee are discussed and the text of a draft fair, simple English, standard form guarantee is suggested (Chapter 9). The law is as stated at 30 November, 1985.

2500|$|In {{commercial}} practice the term [...] "debenture" [...] typically {{refers to the}} document that evidences a secured debt, although in law the definition may also cover unsecured debts (like any [...] "IOU"). The legal definition is relevant for certain tax statutes, so for instance in British India Steam Navigation Co v IRC Lindley J held that a simple [...] "acknowledgement of indebtedness" [...] was a debenture, which meant that a paper on which directors promised to pay the holder £100 in 1882 and 5% interest each half year was enough, {{and as a result}} subject to pay duty under the Stamp Act 1870. The definition depends on the purpose of the statutory provision for which it is used. It matters because debenture holders have the right to company accounts and the director's report, because debenture holders must be recorded on a company register which other debenture holders may inspect, and when issued by a company, debentures are not subject to the rule against [...] "clogs on the equity of redemption". This old equitable rule was a form of common law consumer protection, which held that if a person contracted for a mortgage, they must always have the right to pay off the debt and get full title to their property back. The mortgage agreement could not be turned into a sale to the lender, and one could not contract for a perpetual period for interest repayments. However, because the rule limited on contractual freedom to protect borrowers with weaker bargaining power, it was thought to be inappropriate for companies. In Kreglinger v New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co Ltd the House of Lords held that an agreement by New Patagonia to sell sheepskins exclusively to Kreglinger in return for a £10,000 loan secured by a floating charge would persist for five years even after the principal sum was repaid. The contract to keep buying exclusively was construed to not be a clog on redeeming autonomy from the loan because the rule's purpose was to preclude <b>unconscionable</b> <b>bargains.</b> Subsequently, the clog on the equity of redemption rule as a whole was abolished by what is now section 739 of the Companies Act 2006. In Knightsbridge Estates Trust Ltd v Byrne the House of Lords applied this so that when Knightsbridge took a secured loan of £310,000 from Mr Byrne and contracted to repay interest over 40 years, Knightsbridge could not then argue that the contract should be void. The deal created a debenture under the Act, and so this rule of equity was not applied.|$|R

40|$|Ben Hogan {{balanced}} {{a mix of}} milk cows, corn, soybeans, sheep, and turkeys, avoided borrowing too much, invented his own machinery, {{and maintained}} an orderly farm, keeping his fences 2 ̆ 2 horse high, bull strong and hog tight. 2 ̆ 2 Above all, he worked hard: 2 ̆ 2 He worked and never slowed. He bulled {{his way through the}} house before sunrise each morning, growling to his sons {{to get out of bed}} and do the chores. 2 ̆ 2 He motivated the sons, who worked as hard as he did, by telling them 2 ̆ 2 You 2 ̆ 7 re the laziest damned rednecks I ever laid eyes on. You 2 ̆ 7 re the weakest goddamned mollycoddles I ever seen. 2 ̆ 2 He souped up his tractors so 2 ̆ 2 he could plow or disc or cultivate more acres per day than anyone else in the county. 2 ̆ 2 By the time World War II started he bought out three other farms around Nowell, South Dakota, expanding his operation from 160 acres to 480. 1 Like millions of other Midwestern farmers during the postwar price plunge, however, Hogan 2 ̆ 7 s fortunes collapsed. When his credit dried up, he borrowed money from the Nowell-Safebuy processing plant, which had purchased his mortgage from the bank. The loan stipulated that the turkeys he raised with the borrowed money could only make their way to the Nowell-Safebuy, where the company could choose the turkeys it wanted and refuse to buy the undesirables. Ben hated the arrangement: 2 ̆ 2 There ain 2 ̆ 7 t a dirt farmer got a pot to piss in, what with prices are this year. [...] . A man either keeps raising turkeys or he don 2 ̆ 7 t get no loans. A man can 2 ̆ 7 t make it without loans. There 2 ̆ 7 s no telling how many farms gone under that way since the war. And the Nowell Safebuy ends up with 2 ̆ 7 em all. 2 ̆ 2 When feed costs increased, Nowell farmers could not make their loan payments and filed suit against Safebuy. The judge ruled that the contract gave Safe buy 2 ̆ 2 undue bargaining power to set prices on the products it buys and undue power to depress prices in a regional market it virtually controls 2 ̆ 2 and refused to 2 ̆ 2 enforce <b>unconscionable</b> <b>bargains.</b> 2 ̆ 2 The company then decided on a new corporate strategy, actual ownership of the turkey farms, bypassing the family farmers completely and creating a larger, more efficient, integrated corporate farming institution. 2 The strategy of the Nowell-Safebuy described in Douglas Unger 2 ̆ 7 s novel Leaving the Land is not new. Corporate attempts to take advantage of scale in American farming are as old as the Republic, but their limited successes kept public criticism at a minimum. The years after World War II, however, marked a 2 ̆ 2 major turning point in American agricultural history 2 ̆ 2 when corporate farming-agricultural production conducted by large-scale industrial corporations in lieu of family farms-became a heated public issue. 3 2 ̆ 2 [Y]ou would end up with what they had in Poland, 2 ̆ 2 predicted the manager of the Grain Terminal Association, 2 ̆ 2 where a large number of great big, fat landlords owned the land, and it was worked by millions of peasant 2 ̆ 7 s-complete feudalism. 2 ̆ 2 Senator Gaylord Nelson (D-WI), a prominent leader in the effort to curb corporate farming, constantly attacked the 2 ̆ 2 trend toward corporate farms 2 ̆ 2 and attempts by corporate agribusiness to 2 ̆ 2 complete the vertical chain from seed to supermarket. 2 ̆ 24 Such fears resulted in a series of studies and long public debates over the issue and prompted significant legislative action, especially at the state level. In retrospect, contemporary warnings about the 2 ̆ 2 emotional appeals 2 ̆ 2 of the anti-corporate farming advocates and the 2 ̆ 2 crisis atmosphere 2 ̆ 2 they created seem justified. 5 The changes that took place were more influenced by the consolidation of existing family farms than any outside 2 ̆ 2 corporate invasion. 2 ̆...|$|R
