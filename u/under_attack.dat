As Rui {{introduces}} Wes to her grandfather Eagun, another villager runs into the room, telling them that the Relic Stone—a shrine protected by Celebi—is <b>under</b> <b>attack.</b> Wes, following Eagun {{to the center of}} the tree, fights off four Cipher agents before the Relic Stone is safe. After resting, Wes is given access to the Relic Stone, the only place where he can purify Shadow Pokémon. After receiving an e-mail from Duking about Mt. battle being <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> by Cipher, Rui asks Eagun where it is and the two headed over there.|$|E
5|$|A king is {{in check}} {{when it is}} <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> {{by at least one}} enemy piece. A piece unable to move because it would place its own king in check (it is pinned against its own king) may still deliver check to the {{opposing}} player.|$|E

5|$|Lützow {{was posted}} {{missing in action}} {{following}} combat on 24 April 1945 while attempting to intercept an attack by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers near Donauwörth. According to Stockert, an examination of U.S. records by Mr. Hirst indicates that Lützow's Me262 crashed near Schrobenhausen. The USAAF flew three attacks against the oil terminals at Schrobenhausen, south of Neuburg an der Donau, that day. On their second mission, 22 B-26 bombers escorted by 16 Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft, were just beginning their bomb run at 3:25pm, when they came <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> by four Me262s. Two P-47s came diving down from their top cover position {{to fend off the}} attacking jets. In this account, one Me262 pilot noticed {{that he was about to}} come <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> and attempted to dive away. Unable to recover from this dive, the American pilots observed the Me262 crashing into a small hill. This Me262 may have been piloted by Lützow.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{performance}} of a Domain Name System (DNS) over P 2 P (Peer-to-Peer) networks is studied. We propose a double ring structure of P 2 P networks to provide a DNS. The architecture is called eDNS (emergency-DNS). eDNS can be used as an emergency mechanism in case of loss of availability of the original DNS. eDNS provides security and robustness for finding information <b>under</b> <b>attacks.</b> The performance of the proposed architecture was measured with the percentage of lost queries and the average number of hops in each query considering scenarios with a number of compromised nodes. Simulations show how {{the performance of}} the DNS is affected <b>under</b> <b>attacks.</b> According to the results, it is observed that the eDNS architecture overcomes the damage caused by attacks improving the availability of the DNS resources. ...|$|R

5|$|Though {{the bulk}} of the revolt took place in and around the {{legislature}} over the issue of social credit and government fiscal policy, Aberhart was also <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> on other fronts. He had been invited to attend the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, set for May1937 in London, and planned to go. Douglas, challenged by Hargrave for the leadership of the social credit movement and <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> by some of his own followers for his lack of cooperation with the world's first social credit government, offered to host Aberhart, and a member of Douglas's social credit secretariat was planning a speaking tour for Aberhart. In the same speech in which he threatened to bring down the government on the supply motion, Blue attacked the trip as an extravagance that depression-ridden Alberta could ill afford. Faced with a political insurgency at home, Aberhart reluctantly decided at the end of March to cancel his trip, inaccurately claiming that he had never definitely decided to go.|$|E
