25|$|The {{extent of}} alcohol myopia’s effects on one’s {{decisions}} about how to react to sexual arousal is dependent upon the level of confliction one feels. The more intense the personal conflict {{of whether or not}} to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom,</b> the greater effect alcohol has on the final decision to engage in risky sexual behavior. Intoxicated males who had felt heavily conflicted about condom use were least likely to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom.</b> Those intoxicated men who had been less conflicted about using a condom were {{more likely to engage in}} safe sex. Therefore, some intoxicated individuals can actually be less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior than their sober counterparts, given appropriate cues. The effects of alcohol myopia on response to sexual arousal also depend on the level of sexual arousal. When sexual arousal levels were high, a greater percentage of men reported not using a condom than when arousal levels were low. This goes back to the importance of saliency in alcohol myopia. The more salient the external cue (in this case, higher levels of sexual arousal were more salient than lower levels) the more likely it is for alcohol to inhibit the comprehension of the consequences of an action.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 report through {{national}} statistics of {{students of the}} last grade before high school, aged generally (86%) 13–15, found out 28.7% of them already had lost their virginity, with both demographics of 40.1% of boys and 18.3% of girls having reduced their rate since the last research, in 2009, that found the results as 30.5% overall, 43.7% for boys and 18.7% for girls. Further about the 2013 research, 30.9% of those studying in public schools were already sexually initiated, versus 18% in private ones; 24.7% of sexually initiated adolescents did not <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> in their most recent sexual activity (22.9% of boys, 28.2% of girls), in spite of at the school environment 89.1% of them receiving orientation about STDs, 69.7% receiving orientation of where to acquire condoms for free (as part of a public health campaign from the Brazilian government) and 82.9% had heard of other forms of contraceptive methods.|$|E

The insistence of a woman {{for a man to}} <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> could imply promiscuity on her part, and thus may hamper the usage of protective barriers during sex. [...] Furthermore, one of the primary methods of contraception among women has historically been sterilisation, which does not protect against the transmission of HIV.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} why sexually experienced {{males and}} females from multiple countries in sub-Saharan Africa do not use condoms. Methods: We used data from sample surveys conducted in eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Respondents were asked about their use of condoms and their reasons for not <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> in last sex with a marital, a regular (non-marital) or a casual partner. Respondents' reasons for not <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> are shown by type of partner and by gender. Results: Males and females most frequently reported trusting their partner as {{the main reason for}} not <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> in last sex with a marital or a regular (non-marital) partner. This suggests that low personal risk perception is the most important reason for not <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> with <b>a</b> marital or a regular partner. <b>A</b> dislike of <b>condoms</b> is the most frequently cited reason for not <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> with <b>a</b> casual partner. Respondents rarely cited the price of <b>condoms</b> as <b>a</b> barrier to <b>condom</b> <b>use.</b> Lack of condom availability was also rarely cited as a reason for not <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom,</b> except to some degree by males in casual partnerships. The latter may be because of the unplanned nature of casual sex activity, rather than because condoms are not available. Conclusions: Behavior change campaigns encouraging sexually experienced people to accurately assess their personal risk of acquiring HIV should be complemented with marketing campaigns emphasizing the positive attributes of condoms...|$|R

40|$|What affects Hiv in South Africa's {{different}} provinces? This thesis examines if education, unemployment rate, GDP per capita, and {{the literacy}} rate has any {{relationship with the}} Hiv prevalence. This is analyzed using theory and data {{in the form of}} a simple microeconomic model and an econometric regression analysis based on cross sectional data of the provinces of South Africa. The regression analysis shows that unemployment rate and education have significant effects of the Hiv prevalence in South Africa. The microeconomic model in the thesis indicates that when education is higher, individuals are more aware that the probability of being infected by Hiv is higher when the Hiv prevalence is high. This leads the expected utility of <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> to shift from being higher when not <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> to being higher when <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom,</b> which prevents Hiv. The conclusion from the analysis is that it is important for South Africa to especially make sure that the educational level is high, but also that the unemployment rate is low, so that spread of the epidemic can be reduced or even eradicated...|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on condom use among {{adolescents}} who are engaging in casual sex. Casual sex {{is defined as a}} sexual encounter between people who are not in a (romantic) relationship. Other names for this are one-night-stands, hook-ups and friends-with-benefits. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the main reasons why adolescents do not (always) use condoms when they are engaging in this type of sexual encounter. Furthermore, this study aimed to determine whether the reasons for not <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> differ by gender and educational level. Also, the study examined the influence of descriptive peer norms on condom use. Logistic regression revealed that the reasons for not <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> when having casual sex do not differ much between men and women. However, men did state significantly more often than women that they enjoyed the sexual encounter less when they were <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom.</b> There was no significant difference in reasons for non-use between different educational levels. Furthermore, the analyses revealed that descriptive peer norms are a significant predictor for condom use among adolescents when having casual sex...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{describe}} young people's use {{of condoms}} in penetrative vaginal intercourse, and to identify the factors associated with this use. MethodThe information was collected <b>using</b> <b>a</b> self-administered questionnaire put in 1, 000 people between 14 and 24 years of age resident {{in the region of}} Andalusia (Spain). The results of the sample were representative and the trust interval was 95 %. A bivariante analysis was carried out and hierarchical logistic regression equations were adjusted to verify associations between the dependent variable «use of the condom in the vaginal intercourse» and the variables proposed from PRECEDE model (predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing). The adjustment of the model was of a 38 %, according to the Nagelkerke's statistic. ResultsOf the people surveyed, 750 had affective and/or sexual relations with physical contact, and 63 % of these had vaginal intercourse (47 % of all surveyed). Of those, people that only had vaginal intercourse once (12 % of all surveyed), 83 % (10, 3 % of all surveyed) <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom,</b> whereas, people that had sex more than once (34 % of all surveyed), 49 % always <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> (16, 9 % of all surveyed). The variables associated with always <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> were: intention of «safe» behaviour with their regular partner and low frequency of practice. The variables associated with never <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> were: living emancipated, having an external locus of control (thinking that becoming infected depends upon external factors), low number of zones of the body identified as pleasure-sensitive, thinking that <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> is not necessary if one trusts his or her partner, intention of «unsafe» behaviour with their regular partner, and not talking with the partner about preventive methods before having sex. DiscussionThe most associated factors with <b>using</b> or not <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> in vaginal intercourse are predisposing (attitudes, values and believes) that are related with the kind of sexual partner. Interventions (based on the young active participation) are suggested to make them perceived the compatibility between the trust with the partner and the use of condom, and put in doubt the «false safety» given by a partner perceived as habitual...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Behavioral surveys help {{interpret}} {{the magnitude of}} HIV/AIDS. We analyzed indicators of knowledge on HIV/AIDS and condom use among sub populations selected for behavioral surveillance in Ethiopia. Methods We used 2005 HIV/AIDS behavioral data from ten target groups. These were female sex workers, defense forces, police force, pastoralists, truck drivers, intercity bus drivers, road construction workers, teachers, factory workers and people in ANC catchment areas. Results Data from 14, 524 individuals were analyzed. The majority were males (63. 6 %). Overall, knowledge of the three preventive methods, misconceptions and comprehensive knowledge was 57 %, 75 % and 18. 5 %, respectively. Female sex workers and the defense force showed some behavioral change in <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> during the most recent sexual encounter and consistently <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> with non-regular sexual partners and paying partners. Women, pastoralists and the illiterate {{were less likely to}} use condom. Conclusion Misconceptions about the transmission of HIV were high and comprehensive knowledge about HIV & AIDS was low, particularly among pastoralists. Consistent condom use and condom use during the last sexual encounter were high among both female sex workers and defense force employees, both with paying and non-regular sexual partners. This might be a positive sign, though a considerable proportion in each target group did not report <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>condom</b> during sex with non-regular partners. </p...|$|R
