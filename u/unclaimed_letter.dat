50|$|In 1907, Ronge was {{transferred}} to the Evidenzbureau, the directorate of military intelligence, where he became a student and protégé of Col. Redl. There, in 1913, Ronge directed the investigations following the discovery of an <b>unclaimed</b> <b>letter</b> containing a large sum of money, which eventually led to the exposure of Redl as a Russian double agent and Redl’s subsequent suicide.|$|E
25|$|Jones filed {{a lawsuit}} in Pulaski County Circuit Court against the Commissioner and Flowers, alleging that the Commissioner's failure to provide notice of the tax sale and of Jones' right to redeem {{resulted}} in the taking of his property without due process. The Commissioner and Flowers moved for summary judgment {{on the ground that}} the two <b>unclaimed</b> <b>letters</b> sent by the Commissioner were a constitutionally adequate attempt at notice, and Jones filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner and Flowers, concluding that the Arkansas tax sale statute, which set forth the notice procedure followed by the Commissioner, complied with constitutional due process requirements.|$|R
5000|$|George L. Herancourt {{was the son}} {{of wealthy}} Cincinnati brewer George M. Herancourt. He helped manage his father's {{business}} interests, being promoted to Vice President of the Herancourt Brewing Company, and branched out into baseball and selling fish. In 1880 he was electd treasurer of the Cincinnati club. He was {{one of the founders of}} the American Association in 1881, attending the founding meeting with fellow townsmen Aaron S. Stern and O. P. Caylor, and was elected secretary/treasurer of the new club. In 1884 he took over as managing owner of the team from Stern, and incorporated the club. His timing was unfortunate. The Reds lost money under his management, and the overextended Herancourt had paid his partners too much for their shares. As a Democrat, he was elected city treasurer in 1883, serving one term. He lost his bid for reelection in 1885. About this time he went broke, having dissipated a large fortune, and there were reports that the treasurer's office had a shortfall in its accounts. The personable Herancourt was said by a local paper to be a known [...] "associate of gamblers and prostitutes." [...] Amidst lawsuits, charges and countercharges, Herancourt's interest in the Reds was taken over by his cousin John Hauck, another wealthy brewer, and George disappeared. Credible reports place him as a $1 a day laborer in Los Angeles, in 1888, a location backed up by <b>unclaimed</b> <b>letters</b> at the Lost Angeles post office. But he disappears from the records after that.|$|R
