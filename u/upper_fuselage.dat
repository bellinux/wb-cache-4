25|$|On 9 June, Harrier nº XZ997 was hit {{again by}} shell {{splinters}} over Sapper Hill, defended {{by at least}} one 35mm section. The aircraft wings and <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> were holed in several places, and the Harrier suffered a minor hydraulic failure on recovery.|$|E
25|$|Redesigned {{with a large}} <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> grafted on, the B-50 design {{would form}} the basis for the Boeing 377 series of airliners and C-97/KC-97 {{military}} transports, with 816 of the KC-97 built. The B-29 and B-50 were phased out with introduction of the jet-powered B-47 Stratojet.|$|E
25|$|The wings were braced to the {{fuselage}} with a parallel pair of struts {{from the lower}} longerons to the spars at about mid-span assisted by N-form, cross-braced jury struts at right angles. Four very short struts from the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> longerons to the wing centre section formed a low cabane.|$|E
5000|$|The bomber was {{equipped}} defensively with five [...]30 in (7.62 mm) Lewis Guns, mounted in pairs in {{positions in the}} nose and <b>upper</b> rear <b>fuselage,</b> and singly in a bottom mount, firing behind and beneath the rear fuselage.|$|R

50|$|Constructed by Stelia Aerospace in Meaulte, its 12×4m, 8.2t {{nose section}} was {{delivered}} in May 2017.The 9 m wide, 8 m long and high, 2,1 t <b>upper</b> front <b>fuselage</b> part, framing the cargo door, was delivered from Stelia Meaulte on 7 July 2017.|$|R
25|$|The ST {{featured}} two open cockpits {{in tandem}} {{in a metal}} semi-monocoque fuselage of two main frames – one steel, {{the other half of}} steel and half of aluminium alloy (alclad) – to take the loads from the wing spars and six more alclad frames; and alclad skin. It had wings in three sections of hybrid construction; the center section integral with the fuselage had tubular steel spars, the front spar a simple tube with an external brace to the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage,</b> and the rear spar {{in the form of a}} parallel chord truss. The two outer wing panels had wooden spars and alclad ribs, with diagonal rods bracing the wings internally. Alclad sheet was used to form the leading edges, and fabric covered the whole structure. When attached, the outer wings were braced with flying wires to the fixed conventional landing gear and landing wires to the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage.</b>|$|E
25|$|G-6 {{versions}} were {{equipped with}} 1,750PS Jumo 213A inline-V12 engines (using the same redesigned annular radiator cores as the Ju 188s powered by them), enlarged fuel tanks and often {{one or two}} 20mm MG 151/20 cannons in a Schräge Musik ("Jazz Music", i.e. slanted) installation. These guns were pointed obliquely upwards and forwards from the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> – usually at an angle of 70°.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicle that}} {{was used as an}} {{atmospheric}} drop test glider had no propulsion system. Instead of an operational vehicle's payload bay doors, it had an enclosed and reinforced <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> structure to allow it to be mated with a mothership. In September 2004, DARPA announced that for its initial atmospheric drop tests the X-37 would be launched from the Scaled Composites White Knight, a high-altitude research aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} livery of Air Belgium's later B757 / B737-400 / B737-300 aircraft {{consisted of}} black AIR BELGIUM titles and {{yellow and red}} striping (on the white <b>upper</b> and side <b>fuselage</b> / tail), Black-Yellow-Red being the colors of Belgium's national flag.|$|R
25|$|The Antonov OKB {{set about}} {{rectifying}} these faults with increased-area {{vertical and horizontal}} tail surfaces, anti-spin strakes on the <b>upper</b> rear <b>fuselage</b> sides, deleting the wing LE slats, local structural reinforcements and replacing the TV-2 engines with Ivchenko AI-20D turboprop engines, which had {{the added benefit of}} reducing the empty weight by three tonnes (6,600lb). The new design required the use of new production techniques, such as stamping and forging of large high-strength parts, extrusion of long sections, chemical milling of large skin panels and other new techniques.|$|R
25|$|The second {{prototype}} introduced {{upper wing}} radiators {{in lieu of}} the frontal radiator and large cut-outs in the lower wing roots, to improve the pilot's downward vision. These features proved unsuccessful and were omitted from subsequent aircraft. The third and fourth prototypes incorporated numerous modifications to the radiator, <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> decking, fin and rudder. The fourth prototype was selected as the production standard. Series production commenced in October 1917, with 121 Dolphins delivered {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|The most {{pressing}} complaint {{about the new}} Pfalz was that the guns were buried in the fuselage, preventing pilots from clearing gun jams in flight. This feature had been carried over from the earlier Roland designs. In November 1917, Pfalz responded by producing the slightly modified D.IIIa, which relocated the guns to the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> decking. The D.IIIa was distinguishable by its enlarged semicircular horizontal stabilizer and cropped lower wingtips. It also featured a more powerful version of the Mercedes D.III engine.|$|E
25|$|At the time, the Armagnac {{was one of}} {{the largest}} civil {{aircraft}} ever built with a wingspan of almost 50 meters and weight over 77 tonnes. The capacious pressurized cabin (with a near-circular fuselage section with 4.7 m/ 15ft width and height) was intended for a three tier sleeping compartment configuration which ultimately was not fitted to any of the S.E.2010 versions. The fuselage was left with a good deal of unusable space with only open luggage shelves mounted in the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The prototypes {{were ordered}} by the Ministry of Supply to Specification E.15/48. The {{aircraft}} were produced quickly using a few components from other aircraft including the first prototype using a Gloster Meteor canopy. [...] The 707 programme provided valuable insights into the Vulcan's flight characteristics, {{most of the information}} coming from the second and third prototypes which flew before the Vulcan. All 707s were powered by a single Rolls-Royce Derwent centrifugal turbojet. The air intake on the first prototype and later 707B was located on the <b>upper</b> rear <b>fuselage.</b> Five 707s were built altogether.|$|R

50|$|Metal {{side panels}} {{attached}} by half turn ‘Dzus’ fasteners are fitted {{to both sides}} of the fuselage from the engine bay back past the rear cockpit. These allow ready access for ease of inspection, maintenance and cleaning. Additionally the rear <b>fuselage</b> <b>upper</b> turtledeck is easily removed for rear fuselage inspection, maintenance and cleaning.|$|R
25|$|The {{constant}} chord wings were gimbal mounted {{to the lower}} fuselage, with pairs of streamlined compression struts from about 30% span to the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> just ahead of each cockpit. The wing spars were duralumin structures, though {{the first of the}} two Mussels had spruce ribs. The wing section was the untried, thick RAF 33. The wings and empennage were fabric covered; the fin and unbalanced rudder had a shape not unlike the de Haviiland vertical tail and the horizontal tail was externally braced from below.|$|E
25|$|The wooden, cantilever, two-spar {{wing of the}} U 7 {{was almost}} {{trapezoidal}} in plan, with sweep on the leading edge, out to ellipsoidal tips. It also thinned outwards in section {{with most of the}} taper on the upper surface, giving some anhedral. Short ailerons extended to the tips. The wing was mounted over the fuselage on six streamlined steel struts; two upright tripods ran from the forward spar to points on the upper and mid fuselage and two inverted V-struts joined the rear spar to the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} three {{production}} variants, the M.23a used low-powered engines and had a very angular vertical tail. The M.23b had curved <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> decking and a more rounded tail and was produced with a large range of engines, both inline and radial. The length depended slightly on the engine fitted. The final version, the M.23c had an enclosed cockpit, the most powerful engines and was slightly larger (200mm/8in in span, around 500mm/20in in length) than the earlier variants. Its tail was again different, more rounded {{at the top and}} missing the elevator cutaway of the earlier models.|$|E
25|$|Tropicalising {{measures}} {{included the}} installation of an air filter and intake in the <b>upper</b> forward <b>fuselage,</b> just behind the engine cowling, and {{the replacement of the}} L-shaped pitot head under the outer port wing by a straight rod projecting from the port outer wing leading edge. All production aircraft were powered by a (2,590hp/1,932kW) Centaurus V driving a 12ft 9 inch (3.89 m) diameter Rotol propeller. Tempest Mk.IIs produced during the war were intended for combat against Japan, and would have formed part of a proposed British Commonwealth long-range bomber force based on Okinawa, Tiger Force. The Pacific War ended before they could be deployed.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was a ply-covered semi-monocoque, teardrop {{shaped in}} cross-section, which tapered markedly behind the wing. [...] The canopy was a wood framed multi-transparency unit, {{similar to that}} on the Karakán, but with more panels, which preserved {{the contours of the}} <b>upper</b> forward <b>fuselage</b> back almost to the wing leading edge. The tail was conventional, with an all-moving tailplane, mostly fabric covered. [...] The rudder, mounted on a short, narrow fin, was balanced, rounded and full. The Nemere took off from a small, two wheeled dolly and landed on a long skid under the forward fuselage, assisted by s steel tailskid at the rear.|$|R

25|$|The E-34 was {{a single}} engine biplane, seating two in tandem. It had unswept single bay wings of the same span and {{constant}} chord, with some stagger. The wings were fabric-covered wooden structures. Only the lower wing carried dihedral. The N-shaped interplane struts were assisted by flying wire bracing. The upper wing was supported over the fuselage {{by a pair of}} N-shaped struts to the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> longerons. The upper centre section had a large cut-out in its trailing edge for better upward visibility, and also contained the fuel tank. Ailerons were fitted only on the lower wing. The HS-34 had its tailplane mounted on top of the fusealge, carrying split elevators. The rudder was horn balanced.|$|E
25|$|The Schwalbe was {{a single}} bay biplane with thick section, unequal span wooden wings which were built around twin spars and fabric covered. The wings had marked stagger and were braced between the spars with forward leaning, steel tube, N-form interplane struts. The lower wing was {{attached}} directly to the lower fuselage, from which the inner upper wing was braced with an outward leaning pair of parallel struts to the spars and held over the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> {{by a pair of}} inverted V-struts, one on each side, to the forward spar alone. The wings were straight-tapered in plan, with only slight sweep on the leading edge, out to rounded tips. They also tapered in thickness. The Schwalbe had ailerons on both wings, externally connected with vertical rods. The upper ailerons had large balances to serve both surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Thrust was {{provided}} {{by a pair of}} 30kN axial flow Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines. These were directly mounted in the midsection of the wings using tubular trusses and links between the main mounts and the adjacent leading edge of the wing. Each engine drove a 6-kW generator for the 28-V onboard electronics, as well as a hydraulic pump and a bleed air system for cabin pressurization. The wing itself was typically empty, fuel was contained within two internally-support self-sealing fuel tanks and an additional lace-support bag held within the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage.</b> The manufacturer specified that Coffman engine starters should be used to start the engine. An improvised method of starting the engine using compressed air was heavily discouraged by Rolls-Royce, but some operators successfully operated the Canberra's engines in such a manner, the benefit being significant cost savings over the use of cartridges.|$|E
5000|$|Its [...] SPA 6A engines were mounted {{midway between}} the wings in {{push-pull}} configuration. Each engine {{had its own}} cylindrical Lamblin radiator underneath; the tractors had theirs offset outboard and the pushers inboard. The engine pairs were on near-vertical, faired struts between {{the upper and lower}} wing spars; more struts to the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>fuselage</b> further strengthened the mountings.|$|R
50|$|The AC-3 was a high-wing semicantilever {{monoplane}} {{of mixed}} construction. It was fabric {{covered with a}} conventional tail unit. It had three open cockpits, one in the nose for a gunner or observer, one forward of the wing for a pilot, {{and one on the}} <b>upper</b> rear <b>fuselage</b> for a rear gunner. An unconventional engine layout had two 447 kW (600 hp) Hispano-Suiza inline piston engines in tandem supported on eight struts above the fuselage. The installation had to be high enough to allow clearance for the two (one pusher, one tractor) propellers above the fuselage. A hatch in the port side allowed cargo or troops to be carried in the main cabin.|$|R
50|$|Wooden {{construction}} biplane. Fuselage rectangular in cross-section, plywood covered (engine section - aluminum covered). Rectangular two-spar wings, {{plywood and}} canvas covered. Crew of two, sitting in tandem in open cockpits, with individual windshields and twin controls, instructor in rear cockpit. Fixed landing gear, with a rear skid. Engine in front, with a water radiator below fuselage nose (BM-4a,b,c). Two-blade wooden propeller. Fuel tanks in <b>upper</b> wings and <b>fuselage,</b> capacity: 235-270 l.|$|R
25|$|In 1963, BAC Warton {{was working}} on the {{preliminary}} design of a two-seat Lightning development with a variable-geometry wing, based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the variable-sweep wing, which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the Royal Navy's existing aircraft carriers carrier-based aircraft, the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year. Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer Rolls-Royce Spey engine; it is also likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage)</b> to install a larger, more capable radar.|$|E
25|$|PIA {{launched}} its new livery in early April 2010. An Airbus A310, Boeing 777–200 and Boeing 747–300 {{were the first}} aircraft to wear the new look. The livery was unveiled at the PIA headquarters on a Boeing 777 model. The livery consisted of a green and gold strip running around {{the bottom of the}} fuselage and continuing right up until the tail cone. The forward/upper portion was white and at the rear, it was an off white/beige color. The bottom part of the tail blended into the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> as it too is white, {{with the rest of the}} tail painted with a large wavy Pakistan flag, which takes up the whole tail, in a dark green color. At the front of the fuselage 'PIA' was written in a billboard style in dark green and underneath 'Pakistan' was written in golden color. Just behind the cockpit there is a stylized Urdu PIA logo as well as on the engines.|$|E
25|$|The {{airframe}} of the P.8 continued Pulawski's {{theme of}} semi-monocoque stressed skin Aluminium alloy structure with fabric covered control surfaces. The wings were built up around two I-section Aluminium alloy spars with alloy ribs and finely corrugated sheet Duralumin. High set gull style wings {{were attached to}} the <b>upper</b> <b>fuselage</b> with about 5 degrees dihedral out to the joint between centre-section and outer wings which had zero dihedral. Support for the wings came from pairs of struts attached to the lower fuselage and at the thickest section of the outer wings at about 1/3span. A fixed tail-wheel undercarriage consisted of strut mounted mainwheels attached to the fuselage at the wing strut attachment points and a steel shod tail-skid. Cooling for the engine was achieved by a large radiator bath under the rear fuselage on the P.8/I and by special surface heat exchangers under the rear fuselage of the P.8/II. The special heat exchangers caused cooling difficulties and were replaced by small radiators {{either side of the}} rear fuselage aft of the cockpit.|$|E
2500|$|The second prototype, SM-2/2 {{introduced}} horizontal stabilizers {{mounted on}} the <b>upper</b> rear <b>fuselage</b> and guns with shorter barrels. However the AM-5F engine was still not considered powerful enough, and both prototypes received yet more powerful [...] (dry - wet) Mikulin AM-5B engines. Production versions of the AM-5 (Tumansky RD-9) were re-designated RD-9B and the SM-2B was re-designated SM-9/1 when these engines were fitted, effectively becoming the prototype of the MiG-19 series, flying {{for the first time}} on 5 January 1954, piloted by G. A. Sedov, making a total of 132 flights. Final changes included a modified air intake, new [...] Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 guns with 340 rpg, RSIU-3M [...] "Klen" [...] radio, [...] "Uzel-1" [...] transponder, and SRDM-1M [...] "Konus" [...] radio-rangefinder.|$|R
25|$|Final {{assembly}} of the first 747-400 began at Boeing's Everett factory, the longtime site of 747 production, in September 1987. More than {{fifty percent of the}} aircraft was produced by subcontractors, with major structures, engine nacelles, and sub-assemblies supplied by Northrop, and <b>upper</b> deck <b>fuselage</b> frames from Daewoo. All components were integrated during the final assembly process at the Everett factory. The first aircraft, equipped with PW4056 engines, was completed over the winter months of late 1987. On January 26, 1988, the first 747-400 rolled out at the Everett factory, while the first 737-400 rolled out at Boeing's Renton factory on the same day, marking the first double jetliner rollout in the manufacturer's history. By the time of the rollout, the 747-400 program had amassed more than 100 orders.|$|R
50|$|It had a {{cantilever}} wing with a section which was centrally thick but thinned towards the wing tips. The wing was straight tapered in plan, with an unswept leading edge and forward sweep on the trailing edge, and blunt tips. This {{was constructed in}} a novel and patented way, the wing ribs protruding and the gap between them covered with strips of veneer attached by L-shaped strips. The result {{was a very strong}} structure; Kondor claimed that the slight though clearly visible rib protrusion improved the aerodynamics. Wing and fuselage were connected on each side by two struts, one above the other, running from the mid- and <b>upper</b> forward <b>fuselage</b> to a common junction at the wing leading edge together with three forward-leaning struts from the fuselage close to the cockpit to the wing underside.|$|R
