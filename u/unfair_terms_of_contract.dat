The pressure on the growth of the competitiveness motivates some businessmen to useunfair practices especially against those, who are usually not informed on the marketsituation very well. Therefore the EU law maker adopted the minimum standard of the{{consumer protection}}, which is valid in all EU member states. The Council Directive 93 / 13 /EEC names some terms used in the consumer contracts, which could beconsidered as unfair. If there is a proof of their unfair character, it is the role of thenational courts to ensure these terms are not binding on the consumers. The Court ofJustice of the EU asks the national courts {{to take into account the}} <b>unfair</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> theconsumer <b>contracts</b> by virtue <b>of</b> office.

30|$|Chapter 8 {{discusses}} the moral frameworks that Siquijodnons use to explain inequality, poverty and wealth in their society {{and in other}} places (p. 163). They tend to see the state of (under)development in light of moral qualities, i.e. poverty and wealth depends more on hard work and cooperation rather than external forces such as <b>unfair</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade {{in the global economy}} (p. 170). The author {{discusses the}} ethic of cooperation and competition by analysing the dynamic of crab mentality (pulling a person down, a characteristic also evident in Caribbean society) and pinulitika (politicised) (p. 186). Drawing on understandings of her informants, Bulloch interprets crab mentality as a critique of envy, unfair competition and lack of cooperation. Aside from attributing underdevelopment to crab mentality, Siquijodnons also point out how corrupt practices such as politicising distribution of resources to favour certain parties hinder the island’s development. The author complicates corruption as a practice that needs to be seen in light of the clientelist relations in Siquijodnon society. What emerges from Bulloch’s analysis is the idea that responsibility for development lies on moral qualities of a people or self-transformation, a common target of development intervention as exemplified by KALAHI-CIDDS (Chapter 7). However, she also points out the external factors that structure inequality and poverty on the island and the Philippines at large such as colonialism, comprador capitalism, debt bondage, structural adjustment and <b>unfair</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade (p. 186).|$|R

40|$|The {{prohibition}} on <b>unfair</b> contract <b>terms</b> in standard form consumer contracts {{has the potential}} to significantly impact on the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> for the sale of land. The definition of ‘consumer contract’ includes contracts for the sale or grant of an interest in land to an individual wholly or predominantly for personal or domestic use. Therefore, a contract for the purchase of a residence for personal occupation by the buyer, as opposed to a purchase for investment purposes, will be a consumer contract potentially attracting the application <b>of</b> the <b>unfair</b> <b>terms</b> provisions. Significant consumer protection mechanisms already exist in most state jurisdictions requiring disclosure of relevant matters to the buyer and providing remedies for the provision of misleading conduct. Minimal evidence <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>terms</b> in land <b>contract</b> was presented to the Productivity Commission Inquiry into the Australian Consumer Policy Framework raising the question as to whether there is an identified problem <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>terms</b> in real estate contracts and if so, whether the same economic and ethical rationales justify regulatory intervention. This article examines what effect if any the introduction <b>of</b> the unfair <b>contract</b> provisions will have on the enforcement <b>of</b> residential land <b>contracts</b> and the viability of previously accepted conditions if challenged as being “unfair terms”. The article concludes that despite the existence <b>of</b> several potentially <b>unfair</b> <b>terms</b> in some land <b>contracts,</b> the intervention <b>of</b> the rules of equity to overcome perceived hardship or unfairness to buyers from strict enforcement <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> means the <b>unfair</b> <b>terms</b> provisions are only likely to operate on terms untouched by those principles. In the authors’ view the scope for operation <b>of</b> the <b>unfair</b> <b>terms</b> provisions will be limited to terms untouched by the principles of equity and consumer protection legislation making it unlikely that there will be any significant realignment of the contractual obligations and rights of buyers and sellers of land...|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} contracts {{which are}} called wrap contracts {{in information technology}} sector are based on one party (businesses) autonomy.
