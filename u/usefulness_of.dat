Method: Data on change in perceptions <b>of</b> <b>usefulness,</b> health, behavioral and psychosocial covariates, and mortality originate from the MacArthur Study of Successful Aging, a prospective study of 1, 189 older adults (aged 70 to 79). Results: Older adults with persistently low feelings <b>of</b> <b>usefulness</b> or who experienced a decline to low feelings <b>of</b> <b>usefulness</b> during the first 3 years of the study experienced a greater hazard of mortality (sociodemographic adjusted hazard ratio = 1. 75; 95 % confidence interval = 1. 22, 2. 51) during a subsequent 9 -year follow-up as compared to older adults with persistently high feelings <b>of</b> <b>usefulness.</b> Discussion: Older adults with persistently low perceived <b>usefulness</b> or feelings <b>of</b> <b>usefulness</b> that decline to a low level may be a vulnerable group with increased risk for poor health out-comes in later life.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} field study is to expand the {{understanding}} of how characteristics of recruiters relate to their adoption of new selection technology. In two studies, among 198 recruiters, we used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), together with two measures of personality (i. e., openness to experience and neuroticism), two information technology specific individual differences (i. e., personal innovativeness in information technology and computer self-efficacy), and reactions to and actual usage of new technology. Both studies showed that all recruiter characteristics (except openness to experience) relate to perceptions <b>of</b> <b>usefulness</b> and ease <b>of</b> use, and that these perceptions relate to intentions to use new selection technologies. Study 2 showed that recruiter characteristics predict perceptions <b>of</b> <b>usefulness</b> and ease <b>of</b> use over and above established predictors of the TAM. Perceptions <b>of</b> <b>usefulness</b> and ease <b>of</b> use were better predictors of intentions to use new technology than perceptions of face validity, predictive validity, and fairness. Thus, {{when it comes to}} the adoption of new selection technology, recruiter characteristics, and perceptions <b>of</b> <b>usefulness</b> and ease <b>of</b> use play an important role. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
