5|$|In 1984, the <b>UK</b> <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defence</b> began {{studies for}} a GR1 Mid-Life Update (MLU). The update to GR4 standard, {{approved}} in 1994, would improve capability in the medium-altitude role based on {{lessons learned from}} the GR1's performance in the 1991 Gulf War. British Aerospace (later BAE Systems) upgraded 142 Tornado GR1s to GR4 standard, beginning in 1996 and finished in 2003. 59 RAF aircraft are receiving the CUSP avionics package which integrates the Paveway IV bomb and installs a new secure communications module from Cassidian in Phase A, followed by the Tactical Information Exchange (TIE) datalink from General Dynamics in Phase B.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recently}} signed a two-year extension to his BBC staff writer's contract, Nigel Kneale was specifically commissioned {{to write a}} sequel to The Quatermass Experiment in early 1955 to challenge the new ITV network. Kneale was inspired by contemporary fears over secret <b>UK</b> <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defence</b> research establishments such as Porton Down, and also by being required, as a BBC staff member, to sign the Official Secrets Act. As with The Quatermass Experiment, Quatermass II was produced and directed by Rudolph Cartier; he and Kneale particularly enjoyed working together. Since the first Quatermass serial, {{the two men had}} collaborated on the literary adaptations Wuthering Heights (1953) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954), and on Kneale's abominable snowman play The Creature (1955).|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the <b>UK</b> <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defence</b> {{issued a}} {{requirement}} for an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter to replace the Royal Navy's Westland Sea Kings, which were becoming inadequate {{in the face of}} advances in Soviet submarine technology. Westland Helicopters put together a proposal, designated WG.34, for a three-engined helicopter of similar dimensions to the Sea King; the WG.34 was to feature more autonomy and a greater range than its predecessor. At the same time, the Italian Navy (Marina Militare) was also considering the replacement of its fleet of Sea Kings, which had been built by the Italian company Agusta; Westland and Agusta soon began talks regarding the joint development of a successor helicopter.|$|E

5|$|The Creature—an {{original}} script by Kneale {{concerning the}} legend of the abominable snowman—was his next collaboration with Cartier, broadcast on 30 January 1955, followed by an adaptation of Peter Ustinov's play The Moment of Truth (10 March 1955), before Kneale was commissioned to write Quatermass II. Specifically designed by the BBC to combat the threat of the new ITV network, which launched just a month before Quatermass II was shown, the serial was even more successful than the first, drawing audiences of up to nine million viewers. Kneale was inspired in writing the serial by contemporary fears over secret <b>UK</b> <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defence</b> research establishments such as Porton Down, as well the fact that as a BBC staff writer he had been required to sign the Official Secrets Act.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered {{adverse health effects}} from exposure to radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the <b>UK</b> <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defence</b> following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had lower rates of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} {{and raising}} {{of the ship}} in the 1970s and early 1980s meant that diving operations ceased, even though modern scaffolding {{and part of the}} bow were left on the seabed. The pressure on conservators to treat tens of thousands of artefacts and the high costs of conserving, storing and displaying the finds and the ship meant that there were no funds available for diving. In 2002, the <b>UK</b> <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defence</b> announced plans to build two new aircraft carriers. Because of the massive size of the new vessels, the outlet from Portsmouth needed to be surveyed {{to make sure that they}} could sail no matter the tide. The planned route for the underwater channel ran close to the Mary Rose wrecksite, which meant that funding was supplied to survey and excavate the site once more. Even though the planned carriers were down-sized enough to not require alteration of Portsmouth outlet, the excavations had already exposed timbers and were completed in 2005. Among the most important finds was the ten-metre (32feet) stem, the forward continuation of the keel, which provided more exact details about the original profile of the ship.|$|E

25|$|Consequently, the Panavia {{partners}} (MBB, BAe and Aeritalia) {{launched the}} Agile Combat Aircraft (ACA) programme in April 1982. The ACA {{was very similar}} to the BAe P.110, having a cranked delta wing, canards and a twin tail. One major external difference was the replacement of the side-mounted engine intakes with a chin intake. The ACA was to be powered by {{a modified version of the}} RB199. The German and Italian governments withdrew funding, and the <b>UK</b> <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defence</b> agreed to fund 50% of the cost with the remaining 50% to be provided by industry. MBB and Aeritalia signed up with the aim of producing two aircraft, one at Warton and one by MBB. In May 1983, BAe announced a contract with the MoD for the development and production of an ACA demonstrator, the Experimental Aircraft Programme.|$|E

According to the <b>UK</b> <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defence</b> {{it was not possible}} to safely recover the aircraft due to the location of the crash and it was destroyed with explosives deliberately.
