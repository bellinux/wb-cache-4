Lucian even imagines that Greek is the <b>universal</b> <b>language</b> of the dead in the underworld. In late antiquity, a Greek-speaking majority lived in the Greek peninsula and islands, major cities of the East, western Anatolia, and some coastal areas. Greek continued as {{the language of the}} Byzantine Empire, and developed into a distinctive medieval Greek that gave rise to modern Greek.|$|E

25|$|In 1668 he {{published}} his Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language. In it {{he attempted to}} create a <b>universal</b> <b>language</b> to replace Latin as a completely unambiguous tongue with which scholars and philosophers could communicate. One aspect of this work was the suggestion of an integrated system of measurement, similar to the metric system but which was never promoted.|$|E
25|$|In the Almanac, his {{estimates}} for numbers of language speakers were rounded {{to the nearest}} million, thus the number for Esperanto speakers is shown as two million. This latter figure appears in Ethnologue. Assuming that this figure is accurate, that means that about 0.03% of the world's population speak the language. Although it is not Zamenhof's goal of a <b>universal</b> <b>language,</b> it still represents a level of popularity unmatched by any other constructed language.|$|E
25|$|The rule forbidding a split infinitive {{comes from}} the time when Latin was the <b>universal</b> <b>language</b> of the world. All scholarly, respectable writing was done in Latin. Scientists and {{scholars}} even took Latin names {{to show that they}} were learned. In Latin, infinitives appear as a single word. The rule which prohibits splitting an infinite shows deference to Latin and to the time when the rules which governed Latin grammar were applied to other languages.|$|E

25|$|Jazz {{played a}} {{critical}} role during the Cold War in establishing political ties. Producer Willis Conover explained jazz as an embodiment of an anti-ideology or an alternative way of living by introducing a new style of music with a lose structure and improvisation. In November 1955, the New York Times declared Louis Armstrong as America's most effective ambassador. What American diplomats could not do, Armstrong and his jazz music did. This article claimed that musicians, such as Armstrong, created a <b>universal</b> <b>language</b> to communicate.|$|E
25|$|Complex {{thoughts}} {{would be}} represented by combining characters for simpler thoughts. Leibniz saw that the uniqueness of prime factorization suggests a central role for prime numbers in the universal characteristic, a striking anticipation of Gödel numbering. Granted, there is no intuitive or mnemonic way to number any set of elementary concepts using the prime numbers. Leibniz's idea of reasoning through a <b>universal</b> <b>language</b> of symbols and calculations, however, remarkably foreshadows great 20th century developments in formal systems, such as Turing completeness, where computation was used to define equivalent universal languages (see Turing degree).|$|E
25|$|The Syrian Cultural Caravan has the {{political}} aim to re-establish {{the complexity of}} the Syrian conflict. It provides the public with another narrative, counterweighting the simplified stories of bombings, attacks and terrorism found in the media. The work of artists is, according to Leila Shahid in La Marseilleise, a <b>universal</b> <b>language</b> to express the Syrian people’s suffering. It gives the opportunity for artists of the caravan to contribute in their own way to raise awareness and engage the public, {{while at the same time}} reflecting on what kind of change art can bring. They do not wish to offer a blueprint, unidimensional solution to the conflict but rather they open up the space for dialogue by creating a platform of exchange.|$|E

Whether or not one believes that a language for all humanity is possible, whether or not one believes that Interlingua will become such a language is totally irrelevant {{from the point of}} view of Interlingua itself. The only fact that matters ({{from the point of view}} of Interlingua itself) is that Interlingua, thanks to its ambition of reflecting the cultural and thus linguistic homogeneity of the West, is capable of rendering tangible services at this precise moment in the history of the world. It is by its present contributions and not by the promises of its adherents that Interlingua wishes to be judged.|$|E
500|$|Leibniz {{envisioned a}} <b>universal</b> <b>language</b> of {{reasoning}} (his characteristica universalis) which would reduce argumentation to calculation, so that [...] "there {{would be no}} more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two accountants.

He recorded 2500 sounds for the film, which was twice the average number for a Star Wars film, and a record in his career. Burtt began work in 2005, and experimented with filtering his voice for two years. Burtt described the robot voices as [...] "like a toddler [...] <b>universal</b> <b>language</b> of intonation.

500|$|Afterwards, Lennox {{developed}} The SING Campaign which {{aimed to}} raise funds and awareness for issues surrounding HIV/AIDS. She also wrote on her official website that the song is about raising money and awareness for what she considers to be an HIV/AIDS genocide. Citing Mandela's speech in which he said, [...] "Let us use the <b>universal</b> <b>language</b> of music, to sing out our message around the world", Lennox wanted [...] "Sing" [...] to be an anthem and symbol of unity and empowerment, to help spread awareness in the world. [...] "Because the incidence of HIV AIDS {{is on the rise}} for women, especially in the pandemic across the whole of the African continent, I thought perhaps I could be of benefit by writing a song and empowering those women who do not have an international voice," [...] the singer clarified.|$|E
500|$|The cover art for No Line on the Horizon is a {{photograph}} of Lake Constance, taken by Japanese photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto; titled Boden Sea, {{it is one of}} 200 pictures in his Seascapes collection. The image was the inspiration for Bono's lyrics on the track [...] "No Line on the Horizon". Sugimoto and U2 struck a deal in which the band could use the photograph as the cover art and Sugimoto could use [...] "No Line on the Horizon" [...] in his future projects; Sugimoto's only stipulation was that no text could be placed on top of the image. Original releases had an equals sign superimposed {{in the middle of the}} album cover, but later releases featured only the image. AMP Visual, who designed the equals sign, stated that it represents [...] "a form of title for the album, from the <b>universal</b> <b>language</b> of mathematics," [...] taking inspiration from the album's theme of [...] "universal balance and contrast, of night and day." [...] Continuing the mathematical theme that the equals sign established, the packaging of the digipak special edition features a [...] "little hidden code" [...] in the form of a piece of the Fibonacci sequence.|$|E
