50|$|Immediately after Extreme Rules on the April 30 Raw, WWE's Chief Operating Officer Triple H {{refused to}} give in to Brock Lesnar's <b>unreasonable</b> <b>contract</b> demands, {{starting}} a feud between the duo and resulting in Lesnar attacking Triple H and (in storyline) breaking Triple H's arm. This led to Lesnar defeating Triple H via submission at SummerSlam. At WrestleMania 29, with Triple H's career on the line, Triple H defeated Lesnar in a No Holds Barred match.

Unfair or <b>unreasonable</b> <b>contracts</b> can be against public policy and void if a more {{concrete}} indication of public interest is involved than mere injustice between the parties. The unfair enforcement of a contract {{by one of the}} parties can also be contrary to public policy and void, but the limits of this defence are uncertain.|$|R
40|$|When Dr. Mohammad Mosaddeq began nationalizing the oil {{industry}} in 1951, the British were taken aback by his recalcitrant position and did everything possible to maintain their absolute dominance of the industry. Three rounds of negotiations were held but all failed to reach a settlement. This study describes a series of oil agreements between Iran and Britain and further delineates Dr. Mosaddeq’s policies, strategies and counter-proposals with respect to bi-literal political-economic interests. A qualitative approach is employed to disclose the unscrupulous methods employed by the British to maintain their interests in Iran {{both before and after}} Iran's nationalization of the {{oil industry}}. We used documentation from the Public Records Office, Kew London (cited with 'G' or 'EP'), which bear significant evidence that substantiates {{the purpose of this study}} which reveals that all oil agreements, as imposed by the British, were unilateral in nature. Dr. Mosaddeq made a very courageous move when he unilaterally broke from <b>unreasonable</b> <b>contracts</b> that were solely designed to protect the British 'status-quo'. Their actions resulted in negative impacts and responses on/to the ongoing negotiations: “Owing to Persian nationalist susceptibilities there is not the slightest hope of success in a direct negotiation Government vis-à-vis Government”—letter from George Binney to Lord Leathers; The Persian Situation, Argument for the Project. 9 Jan. 1952 —whereby two months before the British embassy, in its report dated on 19 November 1951, insisted that “any government is better than Dr. Mosaddeq’s government” (British Embassy, Tehran, G 10101 / 453 / 51, 19 Nov. 1951) ...|$|R
40|$|This essay aim {{to clear}} the {{regulations}} that adjusts the use of non-compete clauses in contracts of employement. The historical developement shows tendencies that more employees have contracts that includes non-compete clauses. This developement does not always correspond with what is allowed concerning these clauses. Non-compete clauses is adjusted by the regulations in the collective agreement known as the agreement of 1969. The agreement has also been accepted outside its regular field of application. Apart from the just mentioned agreement, <b>unreasonable</b> conditions of <b>contracts</b> kan be adapted to what is fair accordning to the swedish constitution of agreements. The paragraphs in question is the 36 and the 38 §§, that adjusts when you can shift the conditions. The 38 § is more applyable {{when it comes to}} conditions about non-compete clauses. The use of non-compete clauses is also regulated by practice in the court of law, the labour court. Many of the regulations are unspecified in their design. It is possible that these unspecified concepts are essential to maintain the possibility of applying the concepts to a larger amount of cases. The metaphysical concepts of the jurisprudence has been criticized several times during the historical developement, for example by the upholders of the positivistic Uppsala school of philosophy (the Scandinavian legal realism). The facts remains that because of its open device of concepts, the jurisprudence becomes dynamic and useable in a lot more contexts. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{a company}} {{is part of an}} {{agreement}} there is a risk that one of the collaborators pursues similar business and takes up competition with the partner or chooses to reveal information about their partner to other parties. To avoid this, companies establish a confidentiality agreement that prohibits the parties to reveal any information. Confidentiality agreements that are eternal have become more common in Swedish contract law in commercial relations. As a result, disputes between collaborators have occurred regarding the unreasonable length and validity of the agreement at a later stage. When a confidentiality agreement is considered to be unreasonable, 36 § of the Swedish contract law (AvtL) can be applicable. The paragraph deals with the legitimacy and the opportunities of re-adjustment of the <b>unreasonable</b> <b>contract.</b> The question is, can a confidentiality agreement that is eternally valid in commercial relations be modified with the support of 36 § AvtL? Pacta sunt servanda is an important principle in Swedish contract law and the confidentiality agreement is no exception. Hence, the duty of fulfilling a contractual obligation is important. The 36 § of AvtL can be applied when an obligation can be considered to be unreasonable. Confidentiality agreements in commercial relations that are eternal can be seen as unreasonable if a partner is inferior or if later occurred relations changes the meaning of an agreement. If information is considered to be an industrial secret it should be classified according to Act on the Protection of Business Secrets (FHL). However, when the information is not any longer regarded as an industrial secret, it can be unreasonable to have a eternal confidentiality agreement. An example of this can be a patent that expires after a certain period of time. Hence the confidentiality agreement should be able to modify, with the support of 36 § AvtL...|$|E
40|$|Standard form {{contracts}} are drafted in advance by the supplier of {{goods or services}} and presented to the consumer on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. The consumer’s only choice is to adhere to, or refuse to adhere to, {{the terms of the}} standard form contracts. They have various advantages for both contracting parties such as cost saving and uniformity. They also have some disadvantages as they are one-sided against consumers and impose unfair terms to the contracting party. Once a contract is signed, it must be honoured. However, public policy can be used to rescue the person from greatly unfair obligations that arise from the contracts. Public policy derives from the Constitution and the fundamental values it enshrines. Consequently, a contractual term that violates the Constitution is contrary to public policy and unenforceable. The Consumer Protection Act (CPA) has a significant impact on standard form contracts. It imposes a duty on the supplier to draw the attention of the customer to the exemption clauses or other contractual terms that oust common law protection. However, the CPA applies only to transactions between suppliers and consumers. The prohibition of unfair, <b>unreasonable</b> or unjust <b>contract</b> terms should apply to every contract. Parliament should intervene and enact legislation to prevent the abuse of freedom of contract by the strong party, to the detriment of other contracting party...|$|R
40|$|This article takes a {{critical}} approach to South African contract law. Employing the post-modern concept of narrative truth {{it is argued}} that one can extract from the South African Law Commission's texts on <b>Unreasonable</b> Stipulations in <b>Contracts</b> (at least) four stories about the South African law of contract. These stories are those of certainty, resistance, equity and the story of the text. The story of the text (i. e., a fully legislated and delineated equity jurisdiction in contract law) was the one recommended to Parliament by the Law Commission. Parliament has however indefinitely suspended the reformative narrative since the Commission's Report was tabled. The author argues that the courts have failed to take issue with the suspension of the (reformative) narrative. Contract law still tells the story of certainty and predictability In (a tentative) conclusion {{it is argued that}}, although the stories generated by the Law Commission's investigation are organised along inescapable dualities, the (political) focus in global contract law has moved to an emphasis on the ethical element of contract. The article concludes with the writer's story, which argues (with reference to the work of Drucilla Cornell and Karin van Marle) for an ethical approach to contract which supports the concepts of communicative freedom and Cornell's exposition of the relationship between Kantian freedom and dignity. The writer's story concludes that the emphasis on the ethical element of contract enjoins contracting communities to engage in deliberative (story-telling) practices which cannot await the story of the law. Finally, issue is briefly taken with the reasons why this is {{a critical}} legal argument...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers and evaluates how {{the implementation}} of the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 (CPA) and more specifically Part G thereof influences the common law in relation to contract law and the consumer s rights to fair just and reasonable contract terms, together with considering the pit falls of the CPA in its current form and the sections which require amendment. It will be illustrated that the CPA has been drafted with the clear intention of protecting and benefiting the consumer by codifying the common law provisions in order to strengthen the consumer s position within consumer markets. Many terms and principles introduced by the CPA are foreign to the South African legal system. It can be expected with any entirely new piece of legislation implemented within an existing legal system that there will be conflicts and uncertainties in the application thereof. Ultimately this dissertation has found two sets of conclusions. Firstly the general effect that Part G of the CPA has on consumer markets, namely strengthening consumer rights thereby enabling consumers, more particularly historically disadvantaged consumers to actively partake in consumer markets as a whole. Secondly this dissertation unfortunately has also found that the CPA has failed to use essential mechanisms as used in the United Kingdom and European Union unfair terms legislation to curb unfair unjust and <b>unreasonable</b> <b>contract</b> terms.
