40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new class of}} <b>unfitted</b> finite element methods with high order accurate numerical integration over curved surfaces and volumes which are only implicitly defined by level set functions. An <b>unfitted</b> finite element method which is suitable for the case of piecewise planar interfaces is combined with a parametric mapping of the underlying mesh resulting in an isoparametric <b>unfitted</b> finite element method. The parametric mapping is constructed in a way such that the quality of the piecewise planar interface reconstruction is significantly improved allowing for high order accurate computations of (<b>unfitted)</b> domain and surface integrals. This approach is new. We present the method, discuss implementational aspects and present numerical examples which demonstrate the quality and potential of this method.

5|$|Although high {{waves and}} severe northeasterly gusts were noted from 6to 7September 1804 at St. Augustine, Florida and {{eight of the}} nine vessels in the local port were {{rendered}} <b>unfit</b> for use, the town proper largely escaped damage.|$|E
5|$|Guest's {{two younger}} {{brothers}} also {{served in the}} Transvaal Scottish. The elder of them, Duke, was later commissioned in the South African Scottish and served in France.

5|$|In mid-1918 Hines was {{discharged}} from the AIF as being medically <b>unfit</b> due to hemorrhoid problems. He arrived back in Australia on 19October 1918.

6000|$|... "I was destined," [...] Agostino, for a soldier's {{life in the}} {{following}} of my valiant foster-brother, your father. Had I preserved the strength of my early youth, undoubtedly a soldier's harness would be strapped here to-day {{in the place of}} this scapulary. But it happened that an illness left me sickly and ailing, and <b>unfitted</b> me utterly for such a life. Similarly it <b>unfitted</b> me for the labour of the fields, so that I threatened to become a useless burden upon my parents, who were peasant-folk. To avoid this they determined to make a monk of me; they offered me to God because they found me <b>unfitted</b> for the service of man; and, poor, simple, self-deluded folk, they accounted that in doing so they did a good and pious thing.|$|R

5|$|Some House Republicans were {{critical}} of Thorne-Begland's {{lying to the}} Navy about his homosexuality, stating that his violation of the military's code of conduct made him <b>unfit</b> for a judgeship. Delegates also stated that they felt Thorne-Begland's homosexuality and previous history of activism would influence his rulings on the bench.|$|E
5|$|The restorations {{completed}} in 1971 made the structure {{wind and water}} tight, added extra windows and installed fresh glazing, but {{as it was then}} abandoned again, weather elements exacerbated by vandalism led to further structural deterioration.

40|$|<b>Unfitted</b> {{finite element}} methods, e. g., {{extended}} finite element techniques or the so-called finite cell method, {{have a great}} potential for large scale simulations, since they avoid the generation of body-fitted meshes {{and the use of}} graph partitioning techniques, two main bottlenecks for problems with non-trivial geometries. However, the linear systems that arise from these discretizations can be much more ill-conditioned, due to the so-called small cut cell problem. The state-of-the-art approach is to rely on sparse direct methods, which have quadratic complexity and are thus not well suited for large scale simulations. In order to solve this situation, in this work we investigate the use of domain decomposition preconditioners (balancing domain decomposition by constraints) for <b>unfitted</b> methods. We observe that a straightforward application of these preconditioners to the <b>unfitted</b> case has a very poor behavior. As a result, we propose a {customization} of the classical BDDC methods based on the stiffness weighting operator and an improved definition of the coarse degrees of freedom in the definition of the preconditioner. These changes lead to a robust and algorithmically scalable solver able to deal with <b>unfitted</b> grids. A complete set of complex 3 D numerical experiments show the good performance of the proposed preconditioners...|$|R

5|$|A Washington Post {{editorial}} {{asked why}} an apparently unstable Army private {{had been able}} to access and transfer sensitive material in the first place. According to her biographer, Manning's sexuality came into play by illustrating for the far right that gay people were <b>unfit</b> for military service, while the American mainstream thought of Manning as a gay soldier driven mad by bullying.|$|E
5|$|After her return, Congress {{served as}} a {{receiving}} ship; being moved between the Norfolk and Washington Navy Yards under tow as needed.

5000|$|From the mid-1950s, a new <b>unfitted</b> {{style of}} {{clothing}} appeared {{as an alternative}} to the tight waist and full skirt associated with the New Look. Vogue Magazine called the knitted chemise the [...] "T-shirt dress." [...] Paris designers began to transform this popular fashion into haute couture. Spanish designer Balenciaga had shown <b>unfitted</b> suits in Paris as early as 1951 and <b>unfitted</b> dresses from 1954. In 1958, Yves Saint Laurent, Dior's protÃ©gÃ© and successor, debuted the [...] "Trapeze Line," [...] adding novel dimension to the chemise dress. These dresses featured a shaped bodice with sloping shoulders and a high waist, but the signature shape resulted from a flaring bodice, creating a waistless line from bodice to knees. These styles only slowly gained acceptance by the wider public. Coco Chanel made a comeback in 1954 and an important look of the latter 1950s was the Chanel suit, with a braid-trimmed cardigan-style jacket and A-line skirt. By 1957, most suits featured lightly fitted jackets reaching just below the waist and shorter, narrower skirts. Balenciaga's clothes featured few seams and plain necklines, and following his lead chemise dresses without waist seams, either straight and <b>unfitted</b> or in a princess style with a slight A-line, became popular. The sleeveless, princess-line dress was called a skimmer. [...] A more fitted version was called a sheath dress.|$|R
