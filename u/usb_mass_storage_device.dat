5|$|USB {{implements}} {{connections to}} storage devices using {{a set of}} standards called the <b>USB</b> <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> <b>device</b> class (MSC or UMS). This was at first intended for traditional magnetic and optical drives and has been extended to support flash drives. It has also been extended to support {{a wide variety of}} novel devices as many systems can be controlled with the familiar metaphor of file manipulation within directories. The process of making a novel device look like a familiar device is also known as extension. The ability to boot a write-locked SD card with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, pristine state of the booting medium.|$|E
25|$|Like the Zen Micro, {{this unit}} has an FM tuner and a microphone, {{but also has}} a line in record function. This model does not use {{proprietary}} USB drivers; it is a standard <b>USB</b> <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
25|$|Flash drives {{implement}} the <b>USB</b> <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> <b>device</b> class so that most modern operating systems can {{read and write}} to them without installing device drivers. The flash drives present a simple block-structured logical unit to the host operating system, hiding the individual complex implementation details of the various underlying flash memory devices. The operating system can use any file system or block addressing scheme. Some computers can boot up from flash drives.|$|E

25|$|The ZEN Nano and the ZEN Nano Plus were {{released}} internationally on June 1, 2006. The player is a rebranded MuVo N200. The ZEN Nano Plus is a <b>USB</b> <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> <b>device,</b> {{and does not}} require proprietary drivers. It has a battery-life of up to 18 hours using an AAA battery. Like the Micro and the MicroPhoto, the Nano is available in ten colors: black, pink, red, orange, green, light blue, blue, purple, gray, and white.|$|E
25|$|This option {{writes the}} {{operating}} system to a disk image (ISO) file, which can be loaded into some emulators (such as Bochs, QEMU or more commonly VMware) or written to a CD-ROM and booted on real hardware. This option also allows deploying to a <b>USB</b> <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> <b>device,</b> such as a USB flash drive, to boot on devices {{that may not have}} an optical disc drive. Because networking is not in place yet, debugging is unsupported with this deploy option.|$|E

50|$|U-Boot has {{support for}} USB, {{so it can}} use a USB {{keyboard}} to operate the console (in addition to input from the serial port), and it can access and boot from <b>USB</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>devices</b> such as SD card readers.|$|R
2500|$|Inside {{the plastic}} casing {{is a small}} printed circuit board, which has some power {{circuitry}} and {{a small number of}} surface-mounted integrated circuits (ICs). Typically, one of these ICs provides an interface between the USB connector and the onboard memory, while the other is the flash memory. [...] Drives typically use the <b>USB</b> <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> <b>device</b> class to communicate with the host.|$|E
2500|$|Also, HP has {{introduced}} a USB floppy drive key, which is an ordinary USB flash drive with additional possilibility for performing floppy drive emulation, allowing its usage for updating system firmware where direct usage of USB flash drives is not supported. [...] Desired mode of operation (either regular <b>USB</b> <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> <b>device</b> or of floppy drive emulation) is made selectable by a sliding switch on the device's housing.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{new product}} {{features}} included auto-synchronization to a folder {{on a host}} PC, support for the <b>USB</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>Device</b> profile, and full USB charging capability (the PRS-500 could only be recharged via USB if the battery was not fully drained, and if the Sony Connect Reader software was installed on the host PC). [...] Also, adding books to [...] "Collections" [...] (a feature to organize and group book titles) is now possible on the storage card, unlike the PRS-500 model.|$|E

50|$|Daprosy worm was a {{malicious}} {{computer program}} that spreads via {{local area network}} (LAN) connections, spammed e-mails and <b>USB</b> <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> <b>devices.</b> Infection comes from a single read1st.exe file where several dozen clones are created at once bearing the names of compromised folders. The most obvious symptom of Daprosy infection {{is the presence of}} Classified.exe or Do not open - secrets!.exe files from infected folders.|$|R
2500|$|USB flash drives use the <b>USB</b> <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> <b>device</b> class standard, {{supported}} natively {{by modern}} operating {{systems such as}} Windows, Linux, [...] and other Unix-like systems, {{as well as many}} BIOS boot ROMs. USB drives with USB 2.0 support can store more data and transfer faster than much larger optical disc drives like CD-RW or DVD-RW drives and can be read by many other systems such as the Xbox360, PlayStation3, DVD players, automobile entertainment systems, and in a number of handheld devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, though the electronically similar SD card is better suited for those devices.|$|E

50|$|The device {{utilizes}} the Samsung proprietary connector for connecting a USB charging/data cable. In addition an adapter can be {{used that}} adds a USB OTG port enabling the tablet to be a <b>USB</b> host <b>device.</b> <b>USB</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>devices</b> can be attached without any need for drivers. Additionally support for USB HID keyboard and mice are possible with this port. Limitations of device options {{are based on the}} Linux kernel version installed.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} some work in the {{development}} of fixes to the problem, including a number of third-party security products that allow companies to set security policies related to USB device use, and features within operating systems that allow IT administrators or users to disable the USB port altogether. Unix-based or Unix-like systems can easily prevent users from mounting <b>storage</b> <b>devices,</b> and Microsoft has released instructions for preventing users from installing <b>USB</b> <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> on its operating systems.|$|R

50|$|High-end SSDs {{had been}} made using the PCI Express bus before NVMe, but using {{non-standard}} specification interfaces. By standardizing the interface of SSDs, operating systems only need one driver to work with all SSDs adhering to the specification. It also means that each SSD manufacturer {{does not have to}} use additional resources to design specific interface drivers. This is similar to how <b>USB</b> <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> are built to follow the USB mass-storage device class specification and work with all computers, with no per-device drivers needed.|$|R
5|$|Though most {{computers}} since mid-2004 can boot from <b>USB</b> <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> <b>devices,</b> <b>USB</b> is {{not intended}} as a primary bus for a computer's internal storage. Buses such as Parallel ATA (PATA or IDE), Serial ATA (SATA), or SCSI fulfill that role in PC class computers. However, USB has one important advantage, {{in that it is}} possible to install and remove devices without rebooting the computer (hot-swapping), making it useful for mobile peripherals, including drives of various kinds (given SATA or SCSI devices may or may not support hot-swapping).|$|R
25|$|Some {{organizations}} forbid {{the use of}} flash drives, {{and some}} computers are configured to disable the mounting of <b>USB</b> <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> by users other than administrators; others use third-party software to control USB usage. The use of software allows the administrator to not only provide a USB lock but also control the use of CD-RW, SD cards and other memory devices. This enables companies with policies forbidding the use of USB flash drives in the workplace to enforce these policies. In a lower-tech security solution, some organizations disconnect USB ports inside the computer or fill the USB sockets with epoxy.|$|R

As the Xbox 360 uses {{a modified version of}} the UPnP AV protocol, some alternative UPnP servers such as uShare (part of the GeeXboX project) and MythTV can also stream media to the Xbox 360, allowing for similar functionality from non-Windows servers.This is possible with video files up to HD-resolution and with several codecs (MPEG-2, MPEG-4, WMV) and container formats (WMV, MOV, TS).|$|R
25|$|Sony eBook Library was {{not officially}} {{supported}} on Linux-based systems or other operating systems, although when {{the device is}} connected it grants access to its internal flash memory and any memory card slots {{as though they were}} <b>USB</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>devices</b> (on all models except PRS-500s that have not received the free EPUB upgrade from Sony), allowing the user to transfer files directly. See the Third party tools section below for a third-party software utility that provides comprehensive support for MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux. Note if the device is locked, using the optional 4 digit pin it will not mount via USB, the lock option needs to be disabled in order to mount the device.|$|R
