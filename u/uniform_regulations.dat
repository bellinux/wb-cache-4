5|$|Voss, an avid motorcyclist, had {{a love of}} {{machinery}} {{that led him to}} consort with his enlisted mechanics, Karl Timms and Christian Rueser; he was even on a first name basis with them. In time, they would transfer squadrons to accompany him. Voss contravened <b>uniform</b> <b>regulations</b> at times and could often be found in the hangar working on his machine beside the mechanics, dressed in a grubby jacket without insignia. His care extended to his craft's exterior; he adorned his Albatros D.III with both a swastika and a heart for good luck. And although he was a casual dresser around his home airfield, when flying he would be well-dressed with a silk shirt beneath his aviation gear. He joked {{that he wanted to be}} presentable to the girls of Paris if he were captured; however, the shirt's silk collar protected his neck from chafing while he swivelled his head about watching for other aircraft during flight.|$|E
25|$|In 1941 the <b>Uniform</b> <b>Regulations</b> were {{modified}} to permit officers and enlisted men {{to wear the}} submarine insignia after they {{had been assigned to}} other duties in the naval service, unless such right had been revoked. The officer insignia was a bronze gold-plated metal pin, worn centered above the left breast pocket and above the ribbons or medals. Enlisted men wore an embroidered silk insignia {{on the outside of the}} right sleeve, midway between the wrist and elbow until 1947 when it was shifted to above the left breast pocket. In 1943 the <b>Uniform</b> <b>Regulations</b> were {{modified to}} allow enlisted men, who were qualified for submarine duty then subsequently promoted to commissioned or warrant ranks, to continue wearing the enlisted submarine insignia until they qualified as submarine officers when they were entitled to wear the officers submarine pin. A 1950 change to <b>Uniform</b> <b>Regulations</b> authorized the embroidered insignia for officers (in addition to pin-on insignia) and a bronze, silver-plated, pin-on insignia for enlisted men (in addition to the embroidered device).|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the costs and}} benefits of <b>uniform</b> accounting <b>regulation</b> in the presence of heterogeneous firms that can lobby the regulator. A commitment to <b>uniform</b> <b>regulation</b> reduces economic distortions caused by lobbying by creating a free-rider problem between lobbying firms at the cost of forcing the same treatment on heterogeneous firms. Resolving this tradeoff, an institutional commitment to uniformity is socially desirable when firms are sufficiently homogeneous or the costs of lobbying to society are large. We show that the regulatory intensity for a given firm can be increasing or decreasing in the degree of uniformity, even though uniformity always reduces lobbying. Our analysis sheds light on the determinants of standard-setting institutions and their effects on corporate governance and lobbying efforts...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{assess the}} long-run {{implications}} for consumer welfare of proposed <b>uniform</b> gasoline price <b>regulation.</b> Such regulation would allow lessee dealers {{to ignore the}} terms of their lease agreements and purchase gasoline at the 'rack' (i. e., a wholesale distribution terminal) or from whomever and wherever they choose (most typically a 'jobber', i. e., an independent distributor). We show that such regulation would harm consumer welfare by raising wholesale and retail prices without benefiting lessee dealers. Prices would increase because the proposed regulation would prohibit efficient pricing that reflects differences in costs and demand that vary by geographic area and by type of distribution. We also show that even {{under the assumption that}} price differences result solely from price discrimination, <b>uniform</b> price <b>regulation</b> will not necessarily benefit consumers or all lessee dealers.

Contrary to Mandell’s (2008) conclusion, we show that the mixed policy can be dominated when the price elasticity of demand is high. We also demonstrate that having pricing power by firms causes distortions in the market and the chosen domain of dominant mixed policy in imperfectly competitive markets shrinks compared to perfectly competitive markets...|$|R
