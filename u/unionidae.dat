5|$|Bivalves {{appear in}} the fossil record first in the early Cambrian more than 500 million years ago. The total number of living species is about 9,200. These species are placed within 1,260 genera and 106 families. Marine {{bivalves}} (including brackish water and estuarine species) represent about 8,000 species, combined in four subclasses and 99 families with 1,100 genera. The largest recent marine families are the Veneridae, with more than 680 species and the Tellinidae and Lucinidae, each with over 500 species. The freshwater bivalves include seven families, the largest of which are the <b>Unionidae,</b> with about 700 species.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the species}} in the {{freshwater}} mussel family, <b>Unionidae,</b> commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female's mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish, complete with fish-like markings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach {{for a closer look}} and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs. The fish are relatively unharmed.|$|E
500|$|Zebra mussel infestations in the Mississippi River, [...] Great Lakes {{and other}} Midwest rivers are also {{negatively}} affecting American paddlefish populations. [...] Zebra mussels are an invasive species well adapted for explosive population growth {{as a result}} of high rates of fecundity and recruitment. [...] As filter feeders, zebra mussels rely on plankton and can filter significant amounts of phytoplankton and zooplankton from the water, altering the availability of an important food source for paddlefish and native <b>unionidae.</b> [...] A few days after the fertilization of zebra mussel eggs, a microscopic larva emerges called a veliger. [...] During this initial stage of development, which usually lasts a few weeks, veligers are able to swim freely in the water column with other microscopic animals comprising zooplankton. [...] Veligers are poor swimmers, making them susceptible to predation by any animal that feeds on zooplankton. However, natural predation of zebra mussels at any stage of development has not made a significant contribution to the long-term reduction of zebra mussel populations.|$|E
40|$|Freshwater mussels of {{the order}} <b>Unionida</b> have been {{dramatically}} declining globally. Despite their ecological importance, conservation of these animals has been hindered by unresolved taxonomy {{and a lack of}} data on the distribution and status of populations, especially in southern Europe. Although the Italian Peninsula has been noted as a centre of endemism and one of the major refugia of the glacial ages for several taxa, few studies have been performed on the genetic diversity of <b>Unionida.</b> Most importantly, the taxonomic status of several freshwater mussel populations of the Italian Peninsula is still unresolved. Here we present the first comprehensive dataset for the <b>Unionida</b> of the region spanning Italy and the coastal Croatian region (west of the Dinaric Alps). In total, 191 specimens were collected (85 Anodonta, 64 Unio, 17 Microcondylaea bonellii and 25 Sinanodonta woodiana) from 34 sites across the Italian Peninsula and coastal Croatian river basins for molecular identification (COI, 16 S and 28 S). Genetic analyses were performed to understand major phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns. Seven species were detected: three Anodonta species (A. anatina, A. cygnea and A. exulcerata), two Unio species (U. mancus and U. elongatulus), Microcondylaea bonellii, and the invasive Sinanodonta woodiana. The presence of three endemic species (A. exulcerata, U. elongatulus and M. bonellii) confirms the importance of the region as a centre of endemism for freshwater mussels.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{abundant}} freshwater invaders is Dreissena polymorpha which provide wide-ranging direct and indirect impacts on the invaded ecosystems. A particularly notable impact on benthic communities is the extinction of native mollusks of the order <b>Unionida.</b> However, the settlement of D. polymorpha on unionid's shells in Kanevskoe Reservoir did not increase native unionid mortality. Since {{the reason for the}} successful coexistence of native unionids and invading dreissenids in Kanevskoe Reservoir is unknown, we hypothesized that these mollusks have different feeding spectra. To evaluate this hypothesis, we compared feeding spectra of the mollusks using a fatty acid (FA) marker analysis.|$|R
500|$|A pearl {{is created}} in the mantle of a mollusk when an {{irritant}} particle is surrounded by layers of nacre. Although most bivalves can create pearls, oysters in the family Pteriidae and freshwater mussels in the families <b>Unionidae</b> and Margaritiferidae are {{the main source of}} commercially available pearls because the calcareous concretions produced by most other species have no lustre. Finding pearls inside oysters is a very chancy business as hundreds of shells may need to be pried open before a single pearl can be found. Most pearls are now obtained from cultured shells where an irritant substance has been purposefully introduced to induce the formation of a pearl. A [...] "mabe" [...] (irregular) pearl can be grown by the insertion of an implant, usually made of plastic, under a flap of the mantle and next to the mother-of-pearl interior of the shell. A more difficult procedure is the grafting of a piece of oyster mantle into the gonad of an adult specimen together with the insertion of a shell bead nucleus. This produces a superior, spherical pearl. The animal can be opened to extract the pearl after about two years and reseeded so that it produces another pearl. Pearl oyster farming and pearl culture is an important industry in Japan and many other countries bordering the Indian and Pacific Oceans.|$|E

30|$|A {{particularly}} notable {{impact on}} the benthos is the extinction of native mollusks of the order <b>Unionida</b> (Ricciardi et al. 1995; Jokela and Ricciardi 2008). Unionid mortality is strongly correlated to the Dreissena field density (Ricciardi et al. 1995). Invasions by dreissenids are thought to cause severe declines in unionids through physical disturbance and/or food competition (Thorp and Casper 2002). However, there are some examples where the negative effects were not so strong. For instance, the fouling of Unio by Dreissena species in Kievskoe Reservoir, Ukraine, did not cause mass unionid mortality (Kharchenko and Zorina-Sakharova 2002).|$|R

In this perspective, we describe here the collection of <b>Unionida</b> of the Museo di Zoologia dell’Università di Bologna, containing one extinct (Epioblasma haysiana) and nine threatened species, plus another 47 species.

40|$|Manuel Lopes-Lima [et al. ]Freshwater mussels of the Order <b>Unionida</b> provide {{important}} ecosystem functions and services, yet {{many of their}} populations are in decline. We comprehensively review {{the status of the}} 16 currently recognized species in Europe, collating for the first time their life-history traits, distribution, conservation status, habitat preferences, and main threats in order to suggest future management actions. In northern, central, and eastern Europe, a relatively homogeneous species composition is found in most basins. In southern Europe, despite the lower species richness, spatially restricted species make these basins a high conservation priority. Information on freshwater mussels in Europe is unevenly distributed with considerable differences in data quality and quantity among countries and species. To make conservation more effective in the future, we suggest greater international cooperation using standardized protocols and methods to monitor and manage European freshwater mussel diversity. Such an approach will not only help conserve this vulnerable group but also, through the protection of these important organisms, will offer wider benefits to freshwater ecosystems.

40|$|Freshwater mussels of {{the genus}} Diplodon (<b>Unionida)</b> are common {{inhabitants}} of lakes and rivers in South America, and have slow growth and long life spans. We established the annual periodicity of incremental shell growth in Diplodon chilensis patagonicus (d'Orbigny, 1835) and calculated growth rates at different ages, using internal ring counting supported by dyeing methods and δ¹⁸O isotope analyses, in two Patagonian populations (Lago Steffen and its effluent Río Manso Inferior, Argentina). Longevities of ca. 90 years (Lago Steffen) significantly extend the life spans reported in the past. Growth rates for old individuals (> 30 years) from both lake and river populations average 0. 16 mm per year along the axis of minimal growth. We evaluated the seasonal periodicity of minor and trace elements (Mn, Mg, Sr, Ba, Na, S) in situ by Laser Ablation ICP-MS and Electron Probe Microanalyser analyses. Line-scans in a valve from Lago Steffen show that Mn, Sr and Ba are preferentially accumulated during the summer, while higher concentrations of Mg {{are found in the}} winter bands. Metal/Ca ratios may serve as long-term archives of environmental variables, e. g. metal concentrations in water, water temperature and primary productivity.

40|$|The {{freshwater}} mussel family Hyriidae (Mollusca: Bivalvia: <b>Unionida)</b> has a disjunct trans-Pacific distribution in Australasia and South America. Previous phylogenetic analyses have estimated the evolutionary relationships {{of the family}} and the major infra-familial taxa (Velesunioninae and Hyriinae: Hyridellini in Australia; Hyriinae: Hyriini, Castaliini, and Rhipidodontini in South America), but taxon and character sampling have been too incomplete to support a predictive classification or allow testing of biogeographical hypotheses. We sampled 30 {{freshwater mussel}} individuals representing the aforementioned hyriid taxa, as well as outgroup species representing the five other freshwater mussel families and their marine sister group (order Trigoniida). Our ingroup included representatives of all Australian genera. Phylogenetic relationships were estimated from three gene fragments (nuclear 28 S, COI and 16 S mtDNA) using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference, and we applied a Bayesian relaxed clock model calibrated with fossil dates to estimate node ages. Our analyses found good support for monophyly of the Hyriidae and the subfamilies and tribes, as well as the paraphyly of the Australasian taxa (Velesunioninae, (Hyridellini, (Rhipidodontini, (Castaliini, Hyriini)))). The Hyriidae was recovered as sister to a clade comprised of all other Recent freshwater mussel families. Our molecular date estimation supported Cretaceous origins of the major hyriid clades, pre-dating the Tertiary isolation of South America from Antarctica/Australia.

40|$|Many doubts {{still exist}} about which {{freshwater}} mussel Unio species inhabit Northwest Africa. While some authors {{refer to the}} presence of Unio delphinus in the Atlantic North African basins of Morocco, a recent International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessment performed on Moroccan Unio species, recognised the existence of a distinct species, Unio foucauldianus, with a critically endangered conservation status. The present study delivered new genetic, morphological, and geographical distribution data on two Unio species (i. e. U. delphinus and U. foucauldianus) greatly increasing the almost non-existent data on these taxa. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis revealed two highly supported geographically concordant clades, which diverged by 3. 2 [*]±[*] 0. 6 % (uncorrected p distance) : the first distributed across Iberia and corresponding to U. delphinus, and the second distributed across Morocco, corresponding to U. foucauldianus. These results were corroborated by the analysis of ten newly developed microsatellite loci as well as shell morphometry. We suggest that the IUCN critically endangered conservation status of U. foucauldianus should be revised and probably down-listed since its actual distribution is much wider than previously described. Phylogenetic relationships with the other Unio species were resolved, showing that U. delphinus and U. foucauldianus fall inside the pictorum lineage.

40|$|Growth and {{longevity}} of freshwater mussels (<b>Unionida)</b> {{are important for}} defining life-history strategies and assessing vulnerability to human impacts. We used mark-recapture and analysis of shell rings to investigate age and growth of the hyriid, Westralunio carteri, at 5 sites in southwestern Australia. We tested {{the utility of the}} in situ marker calcein for validating the assumption of annulus formation in adults. Calcein was incorporated into the shells of all recovered individuals, but it provided an interpretable reference mark in only 4 of 16 individuals. These 4 individuals produced 1 shell ring subsequent to the mark, supporting the assumption of annulus production during the austral winter. Maximum age ranged among populations from 36 to 52 y and maximum size ranged from 72. 9 to 82. 8 mm. Mean age and length did not differ between sexes, and growth trajectories differed between sexes at only 1 site. Estimates of growth measured by the von Bertalanffy growth constant, K, ranged from 0. 021 to 0. 336 among sites. Estimates from mark-recapture experiments were 20 to 52 % lower than values from shell annuli at all sites except 1 where K from shell annuli was similar to 1 / 2 that estimated from mark-recapture. Both methods showed a positive relationship between K and mean water temperature among sites, suggesting a role of riparian shading in regulating stream temperature, and hence, indirectly influencing mussel growth. Mussel growth and mean N or P concentrations were not related among sites, but total N at the site with highest mussel growth was > 2 x higher than at any other site. Westralunio carteri is a long-lived, slow-growing bivalve. Maximum age, K, and probable age at maturity (4 - 6 y) are similar to other slow-growing freshwater bivalve groups. This suite of life-history traits is considered an adaptation for stable aquatic habitats. Therefore, W. carteri can be expected to adapt poorly to human impacts, such as riparian clearing and water extraction, which increase the temporal variability of environmental conditions in streams...|$|R

40|$|Froufe, Elsa et al. The Potomida genus (Bivalvia, <b>Unionida)</b> has a Circum-Mediterranean {{distribution}} and like other freshwater mussel species, its populations have suffered dramatic declines. Although this genus is currently considered as monotypic, {{it has a}} long history of taxonomic revisions and presently many aspects of its systematics and evolutionary history are unclear. We sampled a total of 323 individuals from 39 different sites across the Potomida genus distribution, and sequenced two mitochondrial (16 S rDNA and Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I) and one nuclear (28 S rDNA) genes to clarify its phylogeny and phylogeographic history. Our results show that the genus includes two well-supported clades, one comprising solely the western Mediterranean species Potomida littoralis, and the other including two eastern Mediterranean species, the Greek endemic P. acarnanica and the Anatolian and Middle Eastern P. semirugata. We suggest that Potomida started radiating during the upper Miocene, and that both vicariance and dispersal events shaped the diversification and distribution of the genus along the Mediterranean region. P. littoralis is further divided in two mitochondrial lineages, one restricted to Europe and the other occurring mostly in North Africa. Moreover, some European basins present both lineages in sympatry. The conservation status of the three recognized species should be reevaluated, particularly P. acarnanica, since it is restricted to two Greek river basins presenting a high risk of extinction. Overall, our results clarify some important gaps in knowledge concerning the phylogeny, phylogeography and evolution of the Potomida genus in the Mediterranean region with important taxonomical, ecological and conservational implications.
