5000|$|In 1921, Gustav Holst {{adapted the}} music from a section of Jupiter from his suite The Planets to create a setting for the poem. The music was {{extended}} slightly to fit the final two lines of the first verse. At {{the request of the}} publisher Curwen, Holst made a version as a <b>unison</b> <b>song</b> with orchestra (Curwen also published Sir Hubert Parry's <b>unison</b> <b>song</b> with orchestra, [...] "Jerusalem"). This was probably first performed in 1921 and became a common element at Armistice memorial ceremonies, especially after it was published as a hymn in 1926.|$|E

50|$|Pou or mōteatea are <b>unison</b> <b>songs</b> {{performed}} in a style reminisicent of precolonial Māori singing. They are an important genre within Maoridom because they tell stories in which historical, genealogical and cultural information is preserved and thus link Māori with their past. Mōteatea {{come in a variety}} of forms including laments, lullabies, and songs about revenge, anger, and love.|$|R
50|$|Spirituals (or Negro spirituals) are {{generally}} Christian songs that {{were created by}} African slaves in the United States. Spirituals were originally an oral tradition that imparted Christian values while also describing the hardships of slavery. Although spirituals were originally unaccompanied monophonic (<b>unison)</b> <b>songs,</b> they are best known today in harmonized choral arrangements. This historic group of uniquely American songs is now recognized as a distinct genre of music.|$|R
5000|$|Although Parry {{composed}} the {{music as a}} <b>unison</b> <b>song,</b> many churches have adopted [...] "Jerusalem"; English cathedrals, churches and chapels frequently {{use it as an}} office or recessional hymn on St George's Day.|$|E
50|$|The Prep Choir is the first, but {{optional}} {{stage in}} vocal training. This choir features boys aged five, six, and seven. Conducted by Olinger, these boys {{are introduced to}} singing through movement, acting and <b>unison</b> <b>song.</b> They perform twice every year and rehearse {{for a short time}} once every week.|$|E
5000|$|In {{adapting}} Blake's poem as a <b>unison</b> <b>song,</b> Parry deployed a two-stanza format, each {{taking up}} eight lines of Blake's original poem. He added a four-bar musical introduction to each verse and a coda, echoing melodic motifs of the song. The word [...] "those" [...] was substituted for [...] "these" [...] before [...] "dark satanic mills".|$|E
50|$|A house singing {{event is}} also held each year, {{this is a}} cross year interhouse event so house points are awarded to those in first, second and third place. Although house singing has been {{relatively}} low key in previous years, there are plans {{to make it more}} important in upcoming years with the introduction of three different categories: senior soloists, <b>unison</b> <b>songs</b> for Years 7-9 and part songs for those in Years 10 - 13.|$|R
50|$|Ludwig's {{contributions}} to musical scholarship include his investigations into Organum, deciphering early neumatic notation (square note notation), {{the discovery of}} Rhythmic modes in the <b>unison</b> <b>songs</b> of the 13th century, and the systematic representation of compositions of the Notre Dame School and the motets of the Ars Nova. He transcribed many multi-part works of the 15th century and published them in critical editions. Ludwig discovered the compositional principal of isorhythm - a term he coined. He also coined the term Stimmtausch.|$|R
50|$|As a composer, Shaw's work {{included}} choral works, anthems, hymn {{tunes and}} arrangements, a ballet called All at Sea, chamber pieces, orchestral works, and other songs, including part-songs and <b>unison</b> <b>songs.</b> Several descants by Shaw, Alan Gray, and Ralph Vaughan Williams appear in Songs of Praise, {{one of the}} earliest hymnals to include such work. Shaw was an enthusiast for folk music and the work of Henry Purcell, and one of his aims was to restore the dignity of Christian music.|$|R
50|$|The poem {{circulated}} privately {{for a few}} years, {{until it}} was set to music by Holst, to a tune he adapted from his Jupiter to fit {{the words of the}} poem. It was performed as a <b>unison</b> <b>song</b> with orchestra in the early 1920s, and it was finally published as a hymn in 1925/6 in the Songs of Praise hymnal (no. 188).|$|E
5000|$|Ethel Smyth {{composed}} {{the song in}} 1910, as a <b>unison</b> <b>song</b> with optional piano accompaniment, with words by Cicely Hamilton. Smyth based the melody for on a traditional tune she had heard in Abruzzo, Italy. She dedicated the song to the WSPU. In January 1911, the WSPU's newspaper, Votes for Women, described the song as [...] "at once a hymn and a call to battle".|$|E
5000|$|... "Thaxted" [...] is a hymn tune by the English {{composer}} Gustav Holst, {{based on}} the stately theme from the middle section of the Jupiter movement of his orchestral suite The Planets and named after Thaxted, the English village where he resided much of his life. He adapted the theme in 1921 to fit the patriotic poem [...] "I Vow to Thee, My Country" [...] by Cecil Spring Rice but that was as a <b>unison</b> <b>song</b> with orchestra. [...] It did not appear as a hymn-tune called [...] "Thaxted" [...] until his friend Ralph Vaughan Williams included it in Songs of Praise in 1926. This setting was sung at the Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997.|$|E
50|$|Nelson's {{compositions}} were legion {{and included}} orchestral works, a ballet, a choral suite and many partsongs, anthems and (particularly) <b>unison</b> <b>songs,</b> song cycles and other solo songs (like Dirty Work and Love is Cruel), piano pieces including the Three Irish Diversions, instrumental works like Cameos for clarinet solo, incidental music for films and radio and TV plays, and many arrangements of Irish and other folksongs. He also made several LP recordings. Among {{the more popular}} of his published miniatures are nursery rhymes in the styles of Mendelssohn and Rossini.|$|R
5000|$|Not {{long after}} graduating from the Royal College of Music, Britten started {{composing}} his collection of mostly <b>unison</b> <b>songs</b> (the last song, [...] "Old Abram Brown", being in canon) to texts he selected from Walter de la Mare's anthology Come Hither. Britten noted in his diary on 2 November 1933 (just over a month before his twentieth birthday) that he had composed that afternoon [...] "a song, for R.H.M.B. & Clive House, very light & bad - 'I mun be married a Sunday'". [...] "Ee-Oh!" [...] followed on 19 December.|$|R
5000|$|A {{considerable}} {{proportion of}} his output consisted of short piano pieces and <b>unison</b> <b>songs</b> suitable for children, {{and in an}} advertisement for his music in 1916 {{it was thought that}} [...] "more than doubtful whether he has a rival among modern British composers who specialise in educational music." [...] The orchestral suite Stella-Mary Dances was written in memory of his oldest daughter who died in 1917, aged 12. They were played (along with his Vicar of Bray variations) on BBC Radio on 15 November 1929; the broadcast was followed by a concert of music from The Beggar's Opera by his brother Frederic, who also conducted.|$|R
5000|$|... "Bring me my Chariot of fire" [...] {{inspired}} {{the title of}} the film Chariots of Fire. A church congregation sings [...] "Jerusalem" [...] {{at the close of the}} film and a performance appears on the Chariots of Fire soundtrack performed by the Ambrosian Singers overlaid partly by a composition by Vangelis. One unexpected touch is that [...] "Jerusalem" [...] is sung in four-part harmony, as if it were truly a hymn. This is not authentic: Parry's composition was a <b>unison</b> <b>song</b> (that is, all voices sing the tune - perhaps one of the things that make it so [...] "singable" [...] by massed crowds) and he never provided any harmonisation other than the accompaniment for organ (or orchestra). Neither does it appear in any standard hymn book in a guise other than Parry's own, so it may have been harmonised specially for the film. The film's working title was [...] "Running" [...] until Colin Welland saw a television programme, Songs of Praise, featuring the hymn and decided to change the title.|$|E
50|$|Ernest Austin (31 December 1874 - 24 July 1947) was an English composer, music {{arranger}} and editor. Although little-remembered today (he {{does not}} even have an entry in the comprehensive New Grove dictionary), Austin's orchestral music enjoyed some success in its own time, including performances at the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts and on BBC Radio during the 1920s. He was a prolific composer of songs, covering {{a wide spectrum of}} mood, from serious Shakespearean settings to ballads of both sentimental and robust natures. He found some success writing piano pieces and <b>unison</b> <b>songs</b> for children. He also made piano transcriptions of the work of other composers, a particularly common practice of the time.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Invisible Man", {{released}} in the UK on 7 August, hit #12 in the UK and was a hit throughout Europe; the video featured scores of computer-duplicated band members moving in <b>unison.</b> This <b>song</b> was later covered by the late Scatman John.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, crowds, {{especially}} in Europe, {{have taken the}} habit of arm-waving in <b>unison</b> throughout the <b>song.</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>unison</b> <b>songs</b> has united {{people about}} common goals and {{experiences}} in the three great folk movements in Sweden, the Revivalist movement, the Temperance movement and the Socialist movement, especially during the most expansive period, 1850 - 1920. The aim/purpose of my investigation has been to examine how the different ideolgies are breaking {{against each other in}} the <b>songs</b> published for <b>unison</b> <b>songs.</b> A characteristic trait of this songs is that the esthetic is less important. From a superior view of song investigation my aim has been to give a survey of the intertextual relations of different song genres. My practical method has been to analyse songs attached to the same tune, often taken from student songs, male choire repertoar or school songs. Many adaptions, imitations, parodies and contrafacts were written during the first expansive years. Writers of the folk movements parodied both the songs of the established society and the songs of the other folk movements. The Revivalist movement and the Socialist movement produced contrafacts and parodies of national and patriotic songs, the Temperance movement parodied the genre of drinking songs, the Socialist movement parodied hymns and satirized religion. However, some new songs of the Temperence movement included the ideology of the older texts, that is national songs/anthems and revivalist songs. The tune has mediated the intertexts even if the new text has been indepentent of the older one. Ideological breakings (?) or connections are mediated by the tunes which carry with them associations from the well known texts, often national anthems, sometimes hymns. The breakings or connections are also mediated by the use of a similar metaphorical language taken from hymns and spiritual songs or from the poetry of the late Romanticism. This imagery or common code has different references, e. g. the imagery of struggle-prisoner-slave-delivery-victory refers to different kinds of evil and good, the goal is not the same. Ideological breakings are visible both towards the older text and between the new texts of the different folk movements. The new texts become intertexts by means of the well known tunes, which the singers (or listeners) during the examined period can have experienced as a dialog or a murmur of different voices...|$|R
5000|$|Like [...] "Space Road", {{this song}} was {{included}} in Casiopea. Intro and ending of this song includes a lot of 16th-note-triplets in impressive <b>unison</b> phrases, and <b>song</b> to symbolize their technical aspects.|$|R
50|$|The University of Michigan added {{permanent}} lighting to Michigan Stadium in {{time for}} the event. The University later announced that fireworks would be used when Michigan entered the ice during the game, as well as after every goal. Following the national anthem, a flyover was conducted by a B-2 Stealth Bomber.A seven-minute fireworks show followed the game, conducted in <b>unison</b> with various <b>songs</b> from the soundtrack for the movie The Big Chill.|$|R
5000|$|Canadian singer Celine Dion covered [...] "The Last to Know" [...] for {{her first}} English-language album, <b>Unison</b> (1990). The <b>song</b> was {{released}} by Columbia Records as the album's fourth single in Canada on 11 March 1991. Later, it was issued as a single {{in the rest of}} the world. The song was written by Brock Walsh and Phil Galdston, and originally recorded by Sheena Easton in 1987. Dion's version was produced by Christopher Neil.|$|R
5000|$|Breaking {{away from}} the {{instrumental}} format of previous work, the album used sound taken from deliberately damaged CDs to combine an experimental glitch aesthetic with an accessible pop sensibility. [...] This new approach gave Oval their first major critical attention. In its development of the glitch aesthetic in electronic music, Systemisch influenced the sound of artists such as Autechre and Björk, who sampled the track Aero Deck in the <b>song</b> <b>Unison,</b> from the album Vespertine.|$|R
5000|$|The song pronounces {{an optimistic}} {{view of life}} through its main themes and the phrases 'hang on until tomorrow' and 'when I'm stuck with a day that's gray and lonely, I just stick out my chin and grin'. It {{appears to be in}} <b>unison</b> with another <b>song</b> in the score, [...] "You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile", which again pronounces the {{importance}} of smiling, though in a much lighter and cheerful tone.|$|R
5000|$|... "I Love You, Goodbye" [...] {{is a song}} by Canadian singer Céline Dion {{from her}} 1992 self-titled English album. The song was written by {{prolific}} American songwriter Diane Warren. It was released as a promo single in the Philippines in 1992 with [...] "I Feel Too Much" [...] as a b side taken from <b>Unison</b> album. The <b>song</b> became popular in different countries. In 1999, the song was featured in the Philippine drama Halik Sa Apoy on GMA Network.|$|R
5000|$|On [...] "Somebody's Watching You" [...] Sly Stone, Graham, Freddie Stone, and Rose Stone {{deliver the}} vocal in <b>unison.</b> The <b>song's</b> {{slightly}} pessimistic tone would be expanded upon {{later in the}} band's career with [...] "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)" [...] and the There's a Riot Goin' On LP, and would be a hit for the Family Stone's vocal group Little Sister, the first Top 40 single to use a drum machine. [...] "Sing a Simple Song" [...] urges the audience to [...] "try a little do re mi fa so la ti do". Diana Ross & the Supremes, The Temptations and The Jackson 5 all recorded it, and the song's guitar riff is heard on Ike & Tina Turner's [...] "Bold Soul Sister" [...] (from The Hunter, 1969), Jimi Hendrix's Band of Gypsys (1970) and Miles Davis' A Tribute to Jack Johnson (1971).|$|R
