50|$|At the {{top level}} of an ODS file system is the master file {{directory}} (MFD), which contains all top-level directory files (including itself), and several system files used to store file system information. On ODS-1 volumes, a two-level directory structure is used: each <b>user</b> <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> (UIC) has an associated user file directory (UFD), of the form GROUP.USER. On ODS-2 and later volumes, the layout of directories under the MFD is free-form, subject to a limit on the nesting of directories (8 levels on ODS-2 and unlimited on ODS-5). On multi-volume sets, the MFD is always stored on the first volume, and contains the subdirectories of all volumes.|$|E

To address this challenge, this work explores a novel form of “wireless ” communication that exploits the capacitive touchscreens which are now used in laptops, phones, and tablets, as a signal receiver. Using a custom built hardware token, {{in the form of}} a wearable ring, we show a proof-of-concept system that transmits a <b>user</b> <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> to the mobile device through the touchscreen. This mechanism works without any modification to the hardware or the firmware of the mobile device...|$|E

The combination of these three regulatory practices were finally supported as being effective enough to protect minors after Carlin Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 837 F.2d 546 (2nd Cir.)

The Cricket sensor based <b>user</b> <b>identification</b> system is integrated with an open source gesture recognition system 2 ̆ 2 Sparsh-UI 2 ̆ 2 to enable rapid multi-touch application development.

40|$|Abstract—User {{identification}} and access control {{have become a}} high demand feature on mobile devices because those devices are wildly used by employees in corporations and government agencies for business and store increasing amount of sensitive data. This paper describes SenGuard, a <b>user</b> <b>identification</b> framework that enables continuous and implicit <b>user</b> <b>identification</b> service for smartphone. Different from traditional active user authentication and access control, SenGuard leverages availability of multiple sensors on today’s smartphones and passively use sensor inputs as sources of user authentication. It extracts sensor modality dependent <b>user</b> <b>identification</b> features from captured sensor data and performs <b>user</b> <b>identification</b> at background. SenGuard invokes active user authentication {{when there is a}} mounting evidence that the phone user has changed. In addition, SenGuard uses a novel virtualization based system architecture as a safeguard to prevent subversion of the background <b>user</b> <b>identification</b> mechanism by moving it into a privileged virtual domain. An initial prototype of SenGuard was created using four sensor modalities including, voice, location, multitouch, and locomotion. Preliminary empirical studies with a set of users indicate that those four modalities are suited as data sources for implicit mobile <b>user</b> <b>identification.</b> I...|$|R
