6000|$|... 'MY LORD' (wrote Ethelberta),--'I am not {{prepared}} at present to enter [...] into {{the question of}} marriage at all. The incident which has occurred [...] affords me every excuse for withdrawing my promise, since it was given [...] <b>under</b> <b>misapprehensions</b> on a point that materially affects my [...] happiness.|$|R
60|$|I {{approved}} heartily. Quite right. Much better. Let {{him ever}} remain <b>under</b> his <b>misapprehension</b> {{which was so}} much more flattering for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah--I was <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension.</b> I did {{not know}} that the child's kidneys and spine were affected, and that the family {{physician}} had recommended--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he {{was perhaps}} <b>under</b> some <b>misapprehension.</b> Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn't catch the latter portion. What was it you...? ...|$|R
60|$|I wish to {{be equally}} frank with the reader of this book. I wish here conscientiously to let forth its shortcomings. I wish no one to read this book <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear you are <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension,</b> Mr. Harnish. There are no {{winnings}} to {{be divided}} with you. Now don't get excited, I beg of you. I have but to press this button..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, Sire," [...] {{she said}} coldly and {{suddenly}} {{beginning to feel}} vaguely puzzled, [...] "I am afraid your Majesty is labouring <b>under</b> the <b>misapprehension,</b> that I have recently done something to deserve special royal thanks, whereas----" ...|$|R
50|$|Ross's {{emphatic}} legal victory did {{not receive}} {{a lot of publicity}} at the time; and many people today still labour <b>under</b> the <b>misapprehension</b> that it was Kit Denton's 1973 book that was the source for the movie.|$|R
6000|$|... "You did quite right, Lieutenant le Tellier," [...] rejoined M. le Maire, who {{was jealous}} of the {{reputation}} of Le Havre. [...] "Gentlemen must be <b>under</b> no <b>misapprehension</b> {{with regard to the}} refinement and hospitality of this town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{said you}} were <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension,</b> Mr. Harnish, that was all. You have been stock gambling, and you have been hard hit. But neither Ward Valley, nor I, nor my associates, feel that we owe you anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "D'ye {{hear that}} now? And did ye ever hear the like? But what did I tell ye? Ye see, the young gentleman's <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension</b> entirely. Perhaps it'll save broken bones if your lordship {{explains}} just {{who and what}} I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Mademoiselle," [...] he said gently, [...] "you are <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension.</b> Believe me, {{you would}} find it well-nigh {{impossible}} to--to--er--to alter your plans now without loss of dignity, and--er--er--I assure you that the bonds are not irksome to me." ...|$|R
25|$|The De Morgans {{came to know}} Elizabeth Fry, who was <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension</b> that Augustus was William Morgan {{the noted}} actuary. The {{introduction}} was through Lady Byron. Through Fry, Sophia became involved in prison and workhouse reform. She was also an anti-slavery and women's suffrage advocate.|$|R
5000|$|Treur means [...] "mourning" [...] in Dutch, and {{was thus}} named during a voortrekker expedition. In 1844, while still <b>under</b> the <b>misapprehension</b> that Hendrik Potgieter {{and his party}} had perished on their journey to Delagoa Bay, their distraught {{relatives}} named the river near their encampment, Treurrivier, or 'mourning river'.|$|R
6000|$|Brooke {{smiled at}} her. [...] "If {{you look at}} it in one light, I {{scarcely}} think that explanation is gratifying to one's vanity. Still, you have also lived in Canada, and you ought to know that whoever parts with a dollar in this country, even <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension,</b> very rarely gets it back." ...|$|R
5000|$|Under Prosecution {{cross-examination}} Griffith-Jones pursued Hoggart's previous {{description of}} the book as [...] "highly virtuous if not puritanical". [...] "I thought I had lived my life <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension</b> as {{to the meaning of}} the word 'puritanical'. Will you please help me?" [...] "Yes, many people do live their lives <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension</b> of {{the meaning of the word}} 'puritanical'. This is the way in which language decays. In England today and for a long time the word 'puritanical' has been extended to mean somebody who is against anything which is pleasurable, particularly sex. The proper meaning of it, to a literary man or to a linguist, is somebody who belongs to the tradition of British puritanism generally, and the distinguishing feature of that is an intense sense of responsibility for one’s conscience. In this sense the book is puritanical." ...|$|R
50|$|It appears, then, {{that the}} legislature, in {{providing}} in section 5(1) of the RHA that a lease “need not … {{be subject to}} the FRLL Act,” believed that those provisions imposed a burden of which the parties to leases of dwellings should be relieved. If so, as shown above, the legislature was <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He laughed. [...] "Even at {{the risk}} of being rude, then. I must make myself clear to you. I would suffer {{anything}} sooner than leave you <b>under</b> any <b>misapprehension</b> of the grounds upon which I should have preferred to face a firing party rather than have been rescued at the sacrifice of your good name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{father has}} ordered you to break your {{engagement}} with Colonel Ray," [...] I said, [...] "but {{he has done}} so <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension</b> of the facts. You owe obedience to your father, but you owe more--to--the man whose wife you have promised to be. I do not think you should give him up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What am I to say? I don't {{want to give}} offence, and I am heartily {{sorry that}} you and your {{daughter}} should be <b>under</b> any <b>misapprehension.</b> But as I sit here there was no engagement between us;--nor, if I must speak out, Lady Augustus, could your daughter have thought that there was an engagement." ...|$|R
50|$|Some detractors {{have claimed}} that the capital funds {{allocated}} to Mareel would have better been spent on other projects, such as to avert the closure of rural schools, apparently <b>under</b> the <b>misapprehension</b> that the funders' capital could have been diverted to bail out the Shetland Islands Council Education revenue budget which had been overspent for many years.|$|R
5000|$|Whereas a {{concurrence}} {{of wills}} between the parties is usually regarded as the primary basis of contractual liability (will theory), mistake (error) in contract refers to {{a situation in which}} a contracting party acts <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension,</b> causing disagreement (dissensus) between the parties. The courts tend to categorise a mistake as one of unilateral, mutual or common: ...|$|R
60|$|Cyril {{glanced at}} the {{photograph}} with another start of surprise. Sure enough, it WAS Guy; his last new cabinet portrait. The police must be acting <b>under</b> some gross <b>misapprehension.</b>|$|R
50|$|Loloish is the {{traditional}} name for the family. Some publications avoid the term <b>under</b> the <b>misapprehension</b> that Lolo is pejorative. Lolo is the Chinese rendition of the autonym of the Yi people, {{and it is only}} pejorative when written with a particular Chinese character (one that uses a beast rather than human radical), a practice that was prohibited by the Chinese government in the 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|In 1853 the German {{scholar and}} {{explorer}} Heinrich Barth visited Timbuktu {{on behalf of}} the British government. During his stay in Gwandu (now in northwest Nigeria) he consulted a copy of the Tarikh al-Sudan in his investigation {{of the history of the}} Songhay empire. However he was <b>under</b> the <b>misapprehension</b> that the author was the Timbuktu scholar Ahmed Baba. In his book Barth wrote: ...|$|R
6000|$|Brown {{looked at}} him with a curious little smile which Austin found disconcerting. [...] "There are Mrs. Hatherly and Muriel. I almost think Jacinta would have liked to know that you and Jefferson were <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension,</b> too. Still, that is, perhaps, not very important, after all. I suppose Jefferson told you that he expects to get a good deal for the Cumbria and her cargo?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] Monsieur D'Estanges said, [...] "surely this quarrel {{might be}} {{arranged}} without fighting. Monsieur de Fontaine addressed my principal, doubtless <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension,</b> with some roughness, which was not unnaturally resented. If Monsieur de Fontaine will express his regret, which he certainly could do without loss of dignity, for {{the manner in which}} he spoke; my principal would, I am sure, gladly accept his apology." ...|$|R
5000|$|Blyde means [...] "glad" [...] or [...] "happy" [...] in Dutch, a name {{derived from}} a voortrekkers' expedition. The 'happy river' was thus named in 1844, when Hendrik Potgieter and others {{returned}} safely from Delagoa Bay {{to the rest of}} their party of trekkers who had considered them dead. While still <b>under</b> this <b>misapprehension</b> they had named the nearby river where they had been encamped, Treurrivier, or 'mourning river'.|$|R
60|$|Whatever justice {{there may}} be (and no doubt there is much) in Mr. Ruskin's accusations against us clergy, he is surely <b>under</b> an entire <b>misapprehension</b> in the charge which he here makes against our Liturgy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was {{not aware}} that my firm had any {{competitors}} in our line of business,' said Merton. 'But perhaps you have come here <b>under</b> some <b>misapprehension.</b> There is a firm of family solicitors on the floor above, and next them are the offices of a company interested in a patent explosive. If your affairs, or your political ideas, demand a legal opinion, or an outlet in an explosive which is widely recommended by the Continental Press--' ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} Test match of 1897/98 Phillips gave Charlie McLeod run out. McLeod was bowled by a no-ball but, {{because of his}} deafness, did not hear the call. He left the wicket, believing he was out, and a fieldsman pulled out a stump and appealed. Under present-day Laws McLeod would be given 'not out' as he had [...] "left his wicket <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension</b> that he was out". (Dean Jones {{suffered}} a similar fate in the West Indies).|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{editors of}} the Semi-Weekly Earthquake evidently labor [...] <b>under</b> a <b>misapprehension</b> {{with regard to the}} Ballyhack railroad. It [...] is not the object of the company to leave Buzzardville off to one [...] side. On the contrary, they {{consider}} {{it one of the most}} important [...] points along the line, and consequently can have no desire to [...] slight it. The gentlemen of the Earthquake will, of course, [...] take pleasure in making the correction.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the first}} Test match of 1897/98 Phillips gave Charlie McLeod run out. [...] McLeod was bowled by a no-ball but, {{because of his}} deafness, did not hear the call.

40|$|The two plays, ‘Frank and Moustique Go Boating’ and ‘Frank and Moustique Get a Life’ {{follow the}} long British {{tradition}} of radio repartee which goes nowhere in particular. The two characters {{that appear in}} both plays are <b>under</b> vivid <b>misapprehensions</b> – in the first they believe they are improvising a performance {{and in the second}} that they are trying to earn a living. The plays have a ludicrous plot with surreal humour, puns, catch phrases and an array of bizarre sound effects...|$|R
6000|$|... "On rereading {{your letter}} {{it seems to}} us that you are laboring <b>under</b> the <b>misapprehension</b> that we pay for {{unsolicited}} manuscripts. This is not our custom, and of course yours was unsolicited. We assumed, naturally, when we received your story, that you understood the situation. We can only deeply regret this unfortunate misunderstanding, and assure you of our unfailing regard. Again, thanking you for your kind contribution, and hoping to receive more from you in the near future, we remain, etc." ...|$|R
500|$|By 1916, the dime, quarter, {{and half}} dollar {{designed}} by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber {{had been struck}} for 25years, and could {{be replaced by the}} Treasury, of which the Mint is a part, without Congressional authorization. [...] Mint officials were <b>under</b> the <b>misapprehension</b> that the designs had to be changed, and held a competition among three sculptors, in which Barber, who had been in his position for 36years, also took part. [...] Weinman's designs for the dime and half dollar were selected.|$|R
