5|$|The years 1976 and 1977 saw <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> {{become a}} major {{political}} issue, with the Ranger Inquiry (Fox) report opening up a public debate about <b>uranium</b> <b>mining.</b> Several groups specifically concerned with nuclear issues were established, including the Movement Against <b>Uranium</b> <b>Mining</b> (founded in 1976) and Campaign Against Nuclear Energy (formed in South Australia in 1976), cooperating with other environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth (which came to Australia in 1975) and the Australian Conservation Foundation (formed in 1975).|$|E
5|$|In 1974 and 1975 concern came {{to focus}} on <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> in Australia and several Friends of the Earth groups were formed. The Australian Conservation Foundation also began voicing concern about <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> and {{supporting}} {{the activities of the}} grass-roots organisations. Concern about the environmental effects of <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> was a significant factor and poor management of waste at an early uranium mine, Rum Jungle, led it to become a significant pollution problem in the 1970s. The Australian anti-nuclear movement also acquired initial impetus from notable individuals who publicly voiced nuclear concerns, such as nuclear scientists Richard Temple and Rob Robotham, and poets Dorothy Green and Judith Wright.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear weapons testing, <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> and export, {{and nuclear}} power have often {{been the subject of}} public debate in Australia, and the anti-nuclear {{movement}} in Australia has a long history. Its origins date back to the 1972–73 debate over French nuclear testing in the Pacific and the 1976–77 debate about <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> in Australia.|$|E

5|$|In March 2012, {{hundreds}} of anti-nuclear demonstrators {{converged on the}} Australian headquarters of global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. The 500-strong march through southern Melbourne {{called for an end}} to <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> in Australia, and included speeches and performances by representatives of the expatriate Japanese community as well as Australia's Indigenous communities, who are concerned about the effects of <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> near tribal lands. There were also events in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Several groups {{specifically}} {{concerned with}} nuclear issues {{were established in}} the mid-1970s, including the Movement Against <b>Uranium</b> <b>Mining</b> and Campaign Against Nuclear Energy (CANE), cooperating with other environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth and the Australian Conservation Foundation. The movement suffered a setback in 1983 when the newly elected Labor Government failed to implement its stated policy of stopping <b>uranium</b> <b>mining.</b> But by the late 1980s, the price of uranium had fallen, the costs of nuclear power had risen, and the anti-nuclear movement seemed to have won its case; CANE was disbanded in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous land {{owners have}} {{consistently}} opposed <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> and have spoken {{out about the}} adverse impact it has on their communities. The British nuclear tests at Maralinga {{were found to have}} left significant radiation hazards in land given back to the Maralinga Tjarutja people, and the issue continues to cause indigenous opposition.|$|E
5000|$|The Australian Labor Party changed {{back its}} {{policy in the}} 1990s to a [...] "no new mines" [...] policy to allow <b>uranium</b> <b>mines</b> already {{approved}} by the Coalition government to go ahead. With {{the opening of a}} fourth <b>uranium</b> <b>mine</b> in Australia in 2001, the Beverley <b>uranium</b> <b>mine,</b> and the approval of a fifth <b>mine,</b> the Honeymoon <b>uranium</b> <b>mine,</b> Labor's stand had essentially become a [...] "five-mine policy", as Nabarlek had since been closed.|$|R

5|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} {{are banned}} in Queensland and Tasmania. <b>Uranium</b> <b>mining</b> was previously prohibited in New South Wales under the Uranium Prohibition Act of 1986, however in 2012 Premier Barry O'Farrell amended the legislation to allow prospecting and mining of uranium in that State.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{production}} of U3O8 (yellowcake) in 2013 amounted to 70,015 tonnes, of which 22,451 t (32%) was mined in Kazakhstan. Other important <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> countries are Canada (9,331 t), Australia (6,350 t), Niger (4,518 t), Namibia (4,323 t) and Russia (3,135 t).|$|E
5|$|The Railroad Commission of Texas, {{contrary}} to its name, regulates the state's {{oil and gas}} industry, gas utilities, pipeline safety, safety in the liquefied petroleum gas industry, and surface coal and <b>uranium</b> <b>mining.</b> Until the 1970s, the commission controlled the price of petroleum because {{of its ability to}} regulate Texas's oil reserves. The founders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) used the Texas agency as one of their models for petroleum price control.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} Malawi is {{predominantly}} agricultural. Over 80% {{of the population}} is engaged in subsistence farming, even though agriculture only contributed to 27% of GDP in 2013. The services sector accounts {{for more than half of}} GDP (54%), compared to 11% for manufacturing and 8% for other industries, including natural <b>uranium</b> <b>mining.</b> Malawi invests more in agriculture (as a share of GDP) than any other African country: 28% of GDP.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with these}} {{proposals}} to examine nuclear {{power as a}} possible response to climate change, anti-nuclear campaigners and scientists in Australia emphasised claims that nuclear power could not significantly substitute for other power sources, and that <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> itself could become {{a significant source of}} greenhouse gas emissions. Anti-nuclear campaigns were given added impetus by public concern about the sites for possible reactors: fears exploited by anti-nuclear power political parties in the lead-up to a national election in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium occurs {{naturally}} in about 65 different minerals and in fossil fuel deposits. It {{is produced in}} China and Russia from steel smelter slag; other countries produce it either from the flue dust of heavy oil, or as a byproduct of <b>uranium</b> <b>mining.</b> It is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high-speed tool steels.

50|$|Arandis, Namibia {{is a town}} in Erongo Region, Namibia. It {{has been}} called the Uranium Capital of the World as it is located just 15 km outside the world's largest open-pit <b>uranium</b> <b>mine,</b> the Rössing <b>Uranium</b> <b>Mine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Rössing <b>uranium</b> <b>mine</b> is the longest-running {{and one of}} {{the largest}} open pit <b>uranium</b> <b>mines</b> in the world, in 2005 it {{produced}} eight percent of global uranium oxide needs(3,711 tons). The most productive mines however are the underground McArthur River <b>uranium</b> <b>mine</b> in Canada which produces 13% of the world's uranium, and the similarly underground poly-metallic Olympic Dam mine in Australia, which despite being largely a copper mine, contains the largest known reserve of uranium ore.|$|R
5|$|Dunstan also faced {{difficulties}} {{on policy}} issues. Factional cracks {{began to appear}} in Labor and the discovery of uranium deposits near the northern outback town of Roxby Downs put the premier in a bind. The uranium was seen as a valuable economic boost in difficult times, but a government ban on its mining on safety grounds was still in force. Dunstan was opposed to <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> but he was seen as lacking in conviction by environmentalists, as well as being criticised by industrialists. By May, his approval rating had fallen to 57%, down from 80% just two years earlier, while unemployment increased. It was also widely anticipated that a book named It's Grossly Improper would soon be released, containing embarrassing allegations about Dunstan's private life.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and isolation of radium in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked {{the development of}} <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, uranium tile glazes accounted {{for the bulk of}} the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, mauve, black, blue, red and other colors.|$|E
5|$|Uranium ore is mined {{in several}} ways: by open pit, underground, in-situ leaching, and {{borehole}} mining (see <b>uranium</b> <b>mining).</b> Low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% uranium oxides. Extensive measures must {{be employed to}} extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% uranium oxides on average. Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali. The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% uranium oxides U3O8. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion.|$|E
50|$|The Ranger <b>Uranium</b> <b>Mine</b> is a <b>uranium</b> <b>mine</b> in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is {{surrounded}} by, but separate from Kakadu National Park, 230 km east of Darwin. The orebody {{was discovered in}} 1969, and the mine commenced operation in 1980, reaching full production of uranium oxide in 1981. It is operated by Energy Resources of Australia, a 68% subsidiary of Rio Tinto Group. <b>Uranium</b> <b>mined</b> at Ranger is sold for use in nuclear power stations in Asia, Europe and North America.|$|R
50|$|The Rössing <b>Uranium</b> <b>Mine</b> in Namibia is the longest-running {{and one of}} {{the largest}} open pit <b>uranium</b> <b>mines</b> in the world and is located in the Namib Desert near the town of Arandis, which is 70 {{kilometres}} from the coastal town of Swakopmund. Discovered in 1928, the Rössing mine started operations in 1976 and, in 2005, produced 3,711 tonnes of uranium oxide, becoming the fifth-largest <b>uranium</b> <b>mine</b> with 8 per cent of global output. Namibia is the world's fourth-largest exporter of uranium.|$|R

5|$|Burnet {{was opposed}} {{to the use of}} nuclear power in Australia owing to the issues of nuclear proliferation. He later {{retracted}} his objections to <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> in Australia, feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; {{he was one of the}} first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco, and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics of tobacco advertising, and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were surprised that the commercial was allowed to run briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the Vietnam War and called for the creation of an international police force.|$|E
5|$|Western Australia has a {{significant}} share of the Australia's uranium reserves, but between 2002 and 2008, a statewide ban on <b>uranium</b> <b>mining</b> was in force. The ban was lifted when the Liberal Party was voted into power in the state and, as of 2010, many companies are exploring for uranium in Western Australia. One of the industry's major players, the mining company BHP Billiton, planned to develop the Yeelirrie uranium project in a 17billion dollar project. Two other projects in Western Australia are further advanced then BHP's Yeelirrie, these being the Lake Way uranium project, which is pursued by Toro Energy, and the Lake Maitland uranium project, pursued by Mega Uranium. But {{it is unlikely that}} any new projects will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low.|$|E
