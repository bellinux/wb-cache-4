5|$|As {{in much of}} the UK, Leeds' {{housing stock}} had fallen into {{disrepair}} {{by the middle of the}} 20th century. The city was overcrowded, and the Victorian terraces were <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> modern inhabitation. Leeds had one of the most Labour orientated councils and in the 1930s pledged to replace 30,000 slums.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{projects}} have several stages of development. Each phase has associated risks. At {{the early stages}} of reconnaissance and geophysical surveys, many projects are cancelled, making that phase <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> traditional lending. Projects moving forward from the identification, exploration and exploratory drilling often trade equity for financing.|$|E
5|$|In Britain and elsewhere, {{commercial}} forestry has created new habitat which has increased numbers, but these gains {{are likely to}} be temporary as the woodland develops and becomes <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> nightjars.

5|$|No {{version of}} the game has been {{released}} outside Japan. This {{has been attributed to}} Nintendo's policy of censoring religious references in games, which rendered the early Megami Tensei titles <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> localization due to their central religious elements. A fan translation of Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei was released on August 28, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a further}} tiny energy gain could be {{extracted}} by synthesizing 62Ni, {{which has a}} marginally higher binding energy than 56Fe, conditions in stars are <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> this process. Element production in supernovas and distribution on Earth greatly favor iron over nickel, and in any case, 56Fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons. Hence, elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation, involving rapid neutron capture by starting 56Fe nuclei.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914 Pilcher was on leave in England, and offered his services to the War Office, but was initially turned down as <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> command by Sir John French; however, in January 1915 he was appointed to command the newly formed 17th (Northern) Division, a New Army division predominantly drawn from northern England.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the opening}} of the Barlow Road, pioneers {{traveling}} by land from the east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission (now The Dalles) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, then a perilous and expensive journey.

5|$|Bridgeport {{was struck}} from the Navy List on 2 October 1941, {{and she was}} {{acquired}} by the Bridgeport Steamship Co. on 2 February 1942 for conversion to merchant service. She proved <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> service as a cargo carrier, and was returned to the government a few months later, when the War Shipping Administration (WSA) took her over on 29 June 1942. The WSA transferred the ship to the War Department in November 1942.|$|E
5|$|During the growth, {{the chamber}} {{materials}} are etched {{off by the}} plasma and can incorporate into the growing diamond. In particular, CVD diamond is often contaminated by silicon originating from the silica windows of the growth chamber or from the silicon substrate. Therefore, silica windows are either avoided or {{moved away from the}} substrate. Boron-containing species in the chamber, even at very low trace levels, also make it <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> the growth of pure diamond.|$|E

5|$|Facilities {{and weather}} {{conditions}} at Kibret {{proved to be}} <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> airborne operations, so the brigade moved to RAF Ramat David in Palestine to continue their training. The brigade came to full strength in May 1943, and in June was sent to Tripoli, where it joined the 1st Airborne Division. Also assigned to the division were the 1st and 2nd Parachute Brigades and the glider infantry of the 1st Airlanding Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Finland had {{a limited}} defence budget after its {{independence}} {{and especially in}} the 1930s. Consequently, the Finnish Defence Forces were lacking military materiel in almost all branches. Much of the military's materiel was outdated, and even proved <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> the field during the Winter War. During the Winter War the material situation improved, but it still lagged behind the more modern and well-equipped Red Army.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} its capture, {{all of the}} mosques and Roman Catholic churches in Jajce were demolished as retribution for the HVO's destruction of the town's only Serbian Orthodox monastery in mid-October. The VRS converted the town's Franciscan monastery into a prison and its archives, museum collections and artworks were looted; the monastery church was completely destroyed. By 1992, all religious buildings in Jajce had been destroyed, save for two mosques whose perilous positioning on a hilltop made them <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> demolition.|$|E
