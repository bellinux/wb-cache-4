According to the consumer information theory, brands signal the quality of experience goods (products whose quality cannot be determined on inspection) to consumers for whom, personal search and testing is relatively costly. We find that the product and customer mix {{in a sample of}} branded and <b>unbranded</b> <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> is generally consistent with the theory. Branded dealers are more likely to carry products for which cheating on quality is an issue and to serve customers for whom personal search and testing is relatively costly...|$|R

40|$|Preterm birth (PTB) is {{a growing}} public health problem {{potentially}} associated with ambient air pollution. Gasoline <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> can emit atmospheric pollutants, including volatile organic compounds potentially implicated in PTB. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the relationship between residential proximity to gasoline <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> and PTB. Singleton live births on the Island of Montreal from 1994 to 2006 were obtained (n[*]=[*] 267, 478). Gasoline <b>service</b> <b>station</b> locations, presence of heavy-traffic roads, and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) were determined using a geographic information system. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the association between PTB and residential proximity to gasoline <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 500 m), accounting for maternal covariates, neighborhood SES, and heavy-traffic roads. For all distance categories beyond 50 m, presence of <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> was associated with a greater odds of PTB. Associations were robust to adjustment for maternal covariates for distance categories of 150 and 200 m but were nullified when adjusting for neighborhood SES. In analyses accounting for the number of <b>service</b> <b>stations,</b> the likelihood of PTB within 250 m was statistically significant in unadjusted models. Associations were, however, nullified in models accounting for maternal covariates or neighborhood SES. Our results suggest that there is no clear association between residential proximity to gasoline <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> in Montreal and PTB. Given the correlation between proximity of gasoline <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> and SES, it is difficult to delineate the role of these factors in PTB. ...|$|R
