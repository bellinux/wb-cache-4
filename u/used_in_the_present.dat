25|$|Horwitz summarises {{findings}} of SLA research, and applies to L2 teaching some principles of L2 acquisition honed from a vast body of relevant literature. Like Asher, Horwitz {{highlights the importance}} of naturalistic experience in L2, promoting listening and reading practice and stressing involvement in lifelike conversations. She explicitly suggests teaching practices based on these principles; ‘uch class time should be devoted to the development of listening and reading abilities’, and ‘eachers should assess student interests and supply appropriate…materials’. The ‘audio-lingual’ teaching practices <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> study are based on principles explicated by Asher and Horwitz; listening featured heavily, closely followed by reading and speaking practice. The vocabulary items taught were deemed relevant for all learners, regardless of age, and, according to Pfeffer, they are among the most commonly used nouns in everyday German language.|$|E
500|$|The form {{started as}} a simple ballad-like song with no fixed form; this fixed quality would only come much later, from the poem [...] "Villanelle (J'ay perdu ma Tourterelle)" [...] (1606) by Jean Passerat. From this point, its {{evolution}} into the [...] "fixed form" [...] <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> day is debated. Despite its French origins, the majority of villanelles have been written in English, a trend {{which began in the}} late nineteenth century. The villanelle has been noted as a form that frequently treats the subject of obsessions, and one which appeals to outsiders; its defining feature of repetition prevents it from having a conventional tone.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "nurture kinship" [...] {{may have}} been first <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> context by Watson (1983), who contrasted it with [...] "nature kinship" [...] (kinship {{concepts}} built upon shared substance of some kind). Since the 1970s, {{an increasing number of}} ethnographies have documented the extent to which social ties in various cultures can be understood to be built upon nurturant acts.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a closed}} system (a system from which no matter can enter or exit), {{one version of}} the first law of {{thermodynamics}} states that the change in internal energy [...] of the system is equal to the amount of heat [...] supplied to the system minus the amount of work [...] done by system on its surroundings. The foregoing sign convention for work is <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> article, but an alternate sign convention, followed by IUPAC, for work, is to consider the work performed on the system by its surroundings as positive. This is the convention adopted by many modern textbooks of physical chemistry, such as those by Peter Atkins and Ira Levine, but many textbooks on physics define work as work done by the system.|$|E
2500|$|The {{auxiliary}} verb is only <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> indicative and perfective screeves {{of indirect}} verbs {{and in the}} perfective screeve of transitive verbs when the direct object is first or second person(s) (these are situations, where the m- set {{is used for the}} subject of the verb, and, therefore, v- set is used to indicate the direct object). The auxiliary verb is the same verb as to be in present screeve. The verb to be for the singular persons are: Me var ("I am"), Shen xar ("You are") and Is aris/ars (as an auxiliary verb shortened version a is used) ("he/she/it is"). For example, miq'vars means [...] "I love him/her" [...] (the s {{at the end of the}} verb indicating that it is the third person whom the speaker loves). In order to say [...] "I love you", the s at the end has to be replaced with xar (as, now, the direct object is the second person): miq'var-xar ("I love you"), mq'varebi-a ("I have loved him/her").|$|E

60|$|I {{was more}} {{confirmed}} in this opinion by the peculiarity of the dialect which Mrs. Baliol used. It was Scottish--decidedly Scottish--often containing phrases and words little <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> day. But then her tone and mode of pronunciation were {{as different from}} the usual accent of the ordinary Scotch PATOIS, as the accent of St. James's is from that of Billingsgate. The vowels were not pronounced much broader than in the Italian language, and there was none of the disagreeable drawl which is so offensive to southern ears. In short, {{it seemed to be}} the Scottish as spoken by the ancient Court of Scotland, to which no idea of vulgarity could be attached; and the lively manners and gestures with which it was accompanied were so completely in accord with the sound of the voice and the style of talking, that I cannot assign them a different origin. In long derivation, perhaps the manner of the Scottish court might have been originally formed on that of France, to which it had certainly some affinity; but I will live and die in the belief that those of Mrs. Baliol, as pleasing as they were peculiar, came to her by direct descent from the high dames who anciently adorned with their presence the royal halls of Holyrood.|$|E

30|$|To {{estimate}} PFR using SSFP cine CMR imaging, the LV contour is demarcated on many slices at many cardiac phases, {{which takes}} a long time.
