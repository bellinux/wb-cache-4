5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} New York City in late December 2009. The {{setting of the}} film required filming in winter during the festive season of Christmas leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Year's Eve. Ravi K. Chandran handled the cinematography, while Sharmishtha Roy handled the film's production design. Filming was done in various locations in New York City, Las Vegas and San Francisco. Anand wanted to capture the distinct flavour of each city.|$|E
5|$|Clippard began 2007 {{with the}} Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class AAA International League. He was 3–2 with a 2.72 ERA {{in his first}} eight starts, {{striking}} out 41 in 39 2/3 innings but allowing 40 hits and 17 walks. Though the Yankees experienced injuries in the starting rotation, they called on Matt DeSalvo and Chase Wright before Clippard. When Darrell Rasner broke his finger in May, Clippard was called <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York. He became the seventh rookie to start a game for the 2007 New York Yankees, following Hughes, DeSalvo, Rasner, Wright, Kei Igawa and Jeff Karstens.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{returned}} to Australia in March 1942, and {{was promoted to}} lieutenant colonel in August. He was appointed Assistant Director of Pathology, I Corps and New Guinea Force. To combat the danger of dysentery, Ford had all available supplies of sulphaguanidine in Australia shipped <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Guinea, where Australian forces were fighting a desperate campaign against the Japanese. This was a new drug that Neil Hamilton Fairley had tested in the Middle East, and found to be effective. An initial dose of 4g followed by 2g doses at four hourly intervals was found to rapidly relieve the symptoms and permit the sufferers to travel.|$|E

5|$|Washington at {{this time}} moved his {{headquarters}} from Middlebrook in New Jersey <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Windsor on the Hudson, with an army of 10,000. The British, led by Clinton, made a move up the Hudson against American posts at Verplanck's Point and Stony Point, and both places succumbed; but a counter-offensive was briefly successful by the patriots led by General Anthony Wayne. Clinton was able to shut off Kings Ferry in the end, {{but it was a}} strategic loss; he could proceed no farther up the river due to American fortifications and Washington's army. The skirmishes at Verplanck's Point and at Stony Point demonstrated that the continental infantry had become quite formidable and were an enormous boost to morale.|$|E
5|$|At Christmas, Kurt elects {{not to go}} back home, and so {{his father}} comes <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York to set up his Christmas tree and {{spend some time with}} him. At this point, he tells Kurt that he has {{prostate}} cancer. He also has brought Blaine with him, who tries to win back Kurt's trust, but the trip is uneasy. When Kurt begins at NYADA, he struggles initially to find his place, and meets a student named Adam Crawford, a senior who wants to recruit him for his own show choir, Adam's Apples, and also seems interested in Kurt himself; Kurt eventually asks him out for coffee. While at Will and Emma's wedding, Kurt and Blaine hook up, leaving their relationship in a question, since Kurt is dating Adam, but not exclusive. When Kurt returns to New York, there is a snowstorm, leaving Kurt, Rachel, Santana, and Adam stuck together in the loft watching movies together. Santana strongly hints about Kurt's hook up with Blaine, and after they are back at school, Adam asks Kurt about his feelings for Blaine. Kurt says that he is desperately trying to get over Blaine, and Adam invites him to find their own romantic movie.|$|E

While Ramesses I was {{the founder of the}} 19th dynasty, in reality his brief reign marked the transition between the reign of Horemheb who had stabilized Egypt in the late 18th dynasty and the rule of the powerful pharaohs of this dynasty, in particular his son Seti I and grandson Ramesses II, who would bring Egypt <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>new</b> heights of imperial power.|$|E
25|$|Clement Greenberg {{included}} {{the work of}} both Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland in a show that he did at the Kootz Gallery in the early 1950s. Clem {{was the first to}} see their potential. He invited them <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York in 1953, I think it was, to Helen's studio to see a painting that she had just done called Mountains and Sea, a very, very beautiful painting, which was in a sense, out of Pollock and out of Gorky. It also {{was one of the first}} stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s Don Javier firmly {{abandoned}} any thought of reconciliation with the Alfonsinos and instructed harsh measures versus those who approached them; however, he remained respectful towards Don Juan and avoided open challenge, still falling short of explicitly claiming the title. He supported Valiente – his position gradually reinforced formally <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>new</b> Jefe Delegado in 1958-1960 - {{in attempts to}} eradicate internal focos of rebellion against collaboration and to combat new openly secessionist anti-collaborative groups. Though 20 years earlier he expelled from the Comunión those who had accepted seats in the Francoist structures, {{at the turn of}} the decades Don Javier viewed the appointment of 5 Carlists to the Cortes as success of the collaborationist policy, especially that the regime permitted new Carlist legal outposts and the movement seemed visibly reinvigorated, now openly present in the public discourse.|$|E

500|$|The Allied command {{structure}} was soon put under strain by Australian reverses in the Kokoda Track campaign. MacArthur was {{highly critical of}} the Australian performance, and confided to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George Marshall, that [...] "the Australians have proven themselves unable to match the enemy in jungle fighting. Aggressive leadership is lacking." [...] MacArthur told Curtin that Blamey should be sent <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Guinea to take personal command of the situation. Curtin later confessed that [...] "in my ignorance (of military matters) I thought that the Commander in Chief should be in New Guinea." [...] Jack Beasley suggested that Blamey would make a convenient scapegoat: [...] "Moresby is going to fall. Send Blamey up there and let him fall with it!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{boundaries}} for {{the highway}} corridor {{were determined by}} the consultants in April 1982, running between 60th and 84th streets, [...] "dipping like a hammock beneath the cities of Kentwood and Wyoming". The {{results of the study}} by BKI were criticized by local planners in May 1982, who called the study [...] "shabby and unprofessional work", and asked the state to fire the consulting firm. Local residents distributed 2,000fliers to their neighbors in opposition to the freeway. The South Belt Local Advisory Board criticized BKI's 110-page study report as [...] "filled with errors"; the consultants' earlier 26-page [...] paper had been rejected by the board and MDOT as [...] "unusable". An editorial in The Grand Rapids Press stated that the study did not help advance the project in the area, instead opening the proposed freeway <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>new</b> controversies. Doubts about the state's budget in 1982 to build the roadway combined with issues over the consultants and their study results.|$|E
500|$|Rowell {{refused to}} give General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) in Brisbane a [...] "ball to ball" [...] {{description}} of the action, sending only factual information at stated times. Failure to keep GHQ up to date could only lead to fears of the worst, which were confirmed when Major General George Kenney reported that in his opinion Port Moresby would soon fall unless something drastic was done, and Rowell was [...] "defeatist". On 17 September, the General MacArthur discussed the situation in New Guinea with Prime Minister John Curtin on the secraphone. He pointed out that while the Japanese faced all the same difficulties as the Australian troops fighting on the Kokoda Track, the Japanese were advancing and the Australians were retreating, and the whole situation seemed to MacArthur {{to be a lot}} like the Malaya. He recommended that General Blamey be sent <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Guinea to take personal command of the situation.|$|E

500|$|Goldfaden seems, in Bercovici's words, to {{have lost}} [...] "his {{theatrical}} elan" [...] in this period. He briefly put together a theater company in 1886 in Warsaw, with no notable success. In 1887 he went to New York (as did Mogulescu, independently). After extensive negotiations and great anticipation in the Yiddish-language press in New York ("Goldfaden in America," [...] read the headline in the 11 January 1888 edition of the New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung), he briefly took on the job of director of Mogulescu's new [...] "Rumanian Opera House"; they parted ways again after the failure of their first play, whose production values were apparently not <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York standards. Goldfaden attempted (unsuccessfully) to found a theater school, then headed in 1889 for Paris, rather low on funds. There he wrote some poetry, worked on a play that he didn't finish at that time, and put together a theater company that never {{got to the point}} of putting on a play (because the cashier made off with all of their funds). In October 1889 he scraped together the money to get to Lvov, where his reputation as a poet again came to his rescue.|$|E
500|$|In Art of the Comic Book: An Aesthetic History, Robert Harvey wrote that, with Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons [...] "had {{demonstrated}} {{as never}} before {{the capacity of the}} [...] medium to tell a sophisticated story that could be engineered only in comics". In his review of the Absolute Edition of the collection, Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times wrote that the dark legacy of Watchmen, [...] "one that Moore almost certainly never intended, whose DNA is encoded in the increasingly black inks and bleak storylines that have become the essential elements of the contemporary superhero comic book," [...] is [...] "a domain he has largely ceded to writers and artists who share his fascination with brutality but not his interest in its consequences, his eagerness to tear down old boundaries but not his drive to find new ones." [...] Alan Moore himself said his intentions with works like Marvelman and Watchmen were to liberate comics and open them <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>new</b> and fresh ideas, thus creating more diversity in the comics world by showing the industry what could be done with already existing concepts. Instead it had the opposite effect, causing the superhero comic to end up stuck in a [...] "depressive ghetto of grimness and psychosis". In 2009, Lydia Millet of The Wall Street Journal contested that Watchmen was worthy of such acclaim, and wrote that while the series' [...] "vividly drawn panels, moody colors and lush imagery make its popularity well-deserved, if disproportionate", that [...] "it's simply bizarre to assert that, as an illustrated literary narrative, it rivals in artistic merit, say, masterpieces like Chris Ware's 'Acme Novelty Library' or almost any part of the witty and brilliant work of Edward Gorey".|$|E
