A downturn in world economy means that the B-class vessels have never operated their intended route. Designed for a service speed of 29 kn, their fuel <b>consumption</b> (300 <b>tonnes</b> per day) makes them uneconomic. Reducing the operating speed to 12 kn, reduced fuel <b>consumption</b> to 50 <b>tonnes</b> per day. However the reduction in cargo being moved favours more economical vessels, such as Edith Mærsk.|$|R

I develop a two-country new Keynesian general equilibrium model with housing and collateral constraints to explore this issue. Results show that in a monetary <b>union,</b> <b>consumption</b> reacts more strongly to monetary policy shocks in countries with high loan-to-value ratios (LTVs), a high pro-portion of borrowers or variable-rate mortgages. As for asymmetric technology shocks, output and house prices increase by more in the country receiving the shock if it can conduct monetary policy independently.

Further-more, I show that when there are asymmetric shocks but identical housing markets, it is bene 8 ̆ 5 cial to form a monetary union with respect to having a exible exchange rate regime.

40|$|Variation in wood density, {{tracheid}} length, resin content, and {{incidence of}} compression wood in radiata pine are documented and discussed {{with respect to}} their potential influence on pulp and paper manufacture. In general terms, each of the properties mentioned tends to decrease southwards within New Zealand. Tree average wood density, for instance, drops 20 % from Auckland to Canterbury Conservancies (455 to 380 kg/m 8). This decrease will result in increased handling costs and wood <b>consumption</b> per <b>tonne</b> of pulp produced, and reduced chemical pulp digester yields. For paper quality, variations in tear index as a consequence of wood property changes are predicted to be substantial. Thus regional wood resource qualities need to be matched with those paper and paperboard products which can be most effectively manufactured from them. Packaging grades of kraft pulps which require high tear strength should, therefore, be produced from the higher density wood found in parts of the Auckland, Rotorua, and Nelson Conservancies...|$|R

40|$|Latvia has set {{a target}} to {{increase}} the gross final consumption of energy from renewable energy sources up to 40 % by 2020. To reach this ambitious objective increasing {{of the amount of}} energy produced from locally available biomass is a priority. In Latvia, as in European <b>Union,</b> <b>consumption</b> of wood and wood waste has increased during the last decade. At the same time, export of pellets and briquettes produced in Latvia is a growing trend, therefore production amounts depend greatly upon export market demand. In the light of a foreseeable increase of the global market of solid biofuels the same trend would be respected in Latvia. Consequently and in the light of an increase in energy consumption this would result in shortages of the substrate biomass for the production of compressed biomass. To cover the growing biomass demand for both domestic consumption and export, potential biomass sources from agricultural and industrial sectors have to be investigated. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} determine the availability of potential herbaceous biomass sources for production of compressed biofuels in Latvia. In order to reach this target the available amounts of herbaceous agricultural and industrial by-products in Latvia have been evaluated and their energy potential has been calculated. In addition, the current use of these materials is described and sustainability aspects of various applications of such materials are discussed. This study intends to provide the necessary background information to select the most suitable and convenient sources (in terms of availability and energy value) for the production of compressed mixed biomass fuels at laboratory conditions and the consecutive determination of quality and physical, mechanical, thermo-chemical and combustion properties of such fuels...|$|R

40|$|The {{smelting}} {{of nickel}} laterite ores to ferronickel alloy {{is unique in}} extractive metallurgy. It treats feed that is very low grade {{with respect to the}} target metal and, as a result, produces much more waste slag than valuable metal product. The energy <b>consumption</b> per <b>tonne</b> of product is therefore high and requires sustained research and design development in an effort to improve the economics of laterite smelting. In this work, the main characteristics of nickel laterite smelting are reviewed, and then a simple and transparent computational thermodynamics model of the electric furnace smelting step is developed. This model predicts the nickel grade, nickel recovery and FeO content of the slag as functions of the iron recovery to ferronickel satisfactorily. It correctly predicts that the carbon and silicon contents in ferronickel increase sharply at high iron recoveries. However, in common with more sophisticated models, it incorrectly predicts the iron recovery at which this increase is observed in practice. It is concluded that the model provides an accessible and a satisfactorily accurate vehicle for understanding the relationships between process variables and process outcomes during nickel laterite smelting...|$|R
40|$|The {{notion that}} global {{agricultural}} output needs to double by 2050 is oft repeated. Using a new International Agricultural Prospects (iAP) Model, to project global agricultural consumption and production, {{we find in}} favour of a future where aggregate agricultural <b>consumption</b> (in <b>tonnes)</b> increases more modestly, by around 69 per cent (1. 3 per cent per year) from 2010 to 2050. The principal driver of this result is a deceleration in population growth in the decades ahead. Per capita income growth and changing demographics (generally ageing population) have significant but secondary roles in spurring growth in agricultural consumption, as does our projected growth {{in the use of}} agricultural feedstocks to meet the growth we envisage in biofuel demand. Worldwide (but not equally everywhere), crop yield growth has generally slowed over the past decade or so. Notwithstanding a projected continuance of this slowdown, the prospective improvements in crop productivity are still sufficient to reduce per capita cropland use, such that land devoted to crops would need to increase by less than 10 per cent. Even in our upper-bound (highconsumption) scenario, we estimate that there remains sufficient productive agricultural land to more than meet the demand without ploughing-in additional forestdominated lands.

30|$|In 2003, {{fuel and}} {{emission}} efficiency were 0.031 – 0.044  kg of oil equivalent per tonne kilometer and 91.1 – 127.5  g of CO 2 equivalent per tonne kilometer respectively. Compare to 1997 data, {{there was a}} small improvement of impact of transport operations on the environment during the studied period (Table 3). The improvement was due to technological development of new vehicles. Fuel and emission efficiency indicators were obtained relating the absolute indicators, fuel <b>consumption</b> in <b>tonnes</b> oil equivalent (toe) and tonnes of CO 2 equivalent (tCO 2 e), to transport work expressed as tonne kilometers [29]. The fuel consumption is estimated from the running kilometers considering: an average consumption value of 0.25 – 0.35  l/km in 2003 and 1997 [26, 29, 30], and using the equivalences of 41.87 petajoules per mtoe and 38.66 megajoules per liter of diesel [31]. The tCO 2 e are directly estimated from the toe using the equivalence of 0.345 toe per tCO 2 e [31]. With the range of values, uncertainties of fuel and emission efficiencies were bounded and sensitivity analysis of the estimates could be calculated. Conversion equivalences are kept constant. Therefore, the fuel and emission efficiency values given in this paper are representative of mean conditions and must be used exclusively as reference values.|$|R
