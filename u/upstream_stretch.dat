50|$|The first {{inhibitory}} {{structure is}} folded by an extended transcript (i.e. -30/99 transcript, coordinates are referenced against the self-cleavage site) spanning from 30 nt upstream of the cleavage site to 15 nt downstream of the 3'-end. The flanking sequence sequesters the ribozyme in a kinetic trap during transcription {{and results in}} the extremely diminished self-cleavage rate. This self-cleavage-preventing structure includes 3 alternative stems: Alt1, Alt2 and Alt3, which disrupt the active conformation. Alt1 is a 10-bp Long-Range-Interaction formed by an inhibitory <b>upstream</b> <b>stretch</b> (-25/-15 nt) and the downstream stretch (76/86 nt). The Alt1 disrupts the stem P2 in the active conformation wherein P2 is proposed to have an activating role for both genomic and antigenomic ribozyme. Alt2 is an interaction between upstream flanking sequence and the ribozyme, and Alt3 is a nonnative ribozyme-ribozyme interaction. The secondary structure of this inhibitory conformation is supported by various experimental approaches. First, direct probing via ribonucleases was performed and the subsequent modeling via mfold 3.0 using constraints from the probing results agrees with the proposed structure. Second, a series of DNA oligomer complementary to different regions of AS1/2 were used to rescue the ribozyme activity; the results confirms the inhibitory roles of AS1/2. Third, mutational analysis introduces single/double mutations outside the ribozyme to ensure the observed ribozyme activity is directly associated with {{the stability of the}} Alt1. The stability of AS1 is found to be inversely related to the self-cleavage activity26.|$|E

Data for the reservoir and a river stretch upstream the reservoir were compared, for evaluating the effects of the management procedures. Methods The fish fauna and physical and chemical factors were studied during five years, before (2005 - 2006) and after the recovery procedures (2007 - 2009), once a year, during the rainy season. Fishes were caught by gill nets, 10 m long and 1. 5, 4, and 6 cm-mesh between adjacent knots. Results After the management procedures, the values of pH and dissolved oxygen increased in the reservoir, whereas conductivity decreased, bringing them closer to those of the <b>upstream</b> <b>stretch.</b> Species richness, diversity, and Catch per Unit Effort in number and biomass, increased in the reservoir after the management.

40|$|Invertebrate macrofaunal {{biodiversity}} within intertidal seagrass meadows {{was investigated}} over a salinity gradient of < 5 – 35 in the Knysna estuarine system (Garden Route National Park, South Africa). Rather than the classic gradual decline in species richness with {{distance from the}} mouth there were zones of considerable faunal stability separated by relatively sharp discontinuities. At the point upstream at which salinity regularly falls below 30, the rich, diverse and highly spatially variable downstream faunal assemblage changed to a less rich, less diverse and more uniform one that dominated the <b>upstream</b> <b>stretch</b> without any further upstream reduction in richness. Nevertheless, without loss of overall richness, assemblage composition changed, again rapidly, in the upper region of the <b>upstream</b> <b>stretch</b> to a zone dominated by the microgastropod Hydrobia, which otherwise occurs in the Knysna system only in highly sheltered regions of the downstream stretch where it is also dominant. The upstream faunal assemblage was a subset {{of that in the}} marine-influenced downstream region not a different replacing one. Position along the estuarine gradient accounted for 29 % of total assemblage variation. Overall faunal abundance declined with distance upstream until the Hydrobia zone where it rose sharply, but {{there was no evidence of}} increase in density of those species remaining on putative release from competition...|$|E

40|$|Arabidopsis COP 1 is a photomorphogenesis {{repressor}} {{capable of}} directly {{interacting with the}} photomorphogenesis-promoting factor HY 5. This interaction between HY 5 and COP 1 results in targeted deg radation of HY 5 by the 26 S proteasome. Here we characterized the WD 40 repeat domain-mediated interactions of COP 1 with HY 5 and two new proteins. Mutational analysis of those interactive partners revealed a conserved motif responsible for the interaction with the WD 40 domain. This novel motif, with the core sequence V-P-E/D-φ-G (φ = hydrophobic residue) in conjunction with an <b>upstream</b> <b>stretch</b> of 4 – 5 negatively charged residues, interacts with a defined surface area of the β-propeller assembly of the COP 1 WD 40 repeat domain through both hydrophobic and ionic interactions. Several residues in the COP 1 WD 40 domain that are critical for the interaction with this motif have been revealed. The fact that point mutations either in the COP 1 WD 40 domain or in the HY 5 motif that abolish the interaction between COP 1 and HY 5 in yeast result in a dramatic reduction of HY 5 degradation in transgenic plants validates the biological significance of this defined interaction...|$|E
40|$|Commission due to poor {{water and}} {{sediment}} quality. Historically, {{the shores of the}} river were a heavily industrialized portion of the city of Buffalo. The river served several purposes: a means of transportation; a source of water; and, a waste receptacle. Direct industrial discharges have been identified as a source ofpollution to the river. Similarly, past industrial practices, in particular, waste handling and disposal, have adversely affected the health ofthe river. This paper sketches a history of industry within three sewer districts that border the Buffalo River beginning in the late 18 oos.

The objectives {{of this study are}} (i) to assess groundwater recharge in an ephemeral river with and without a check dam and (ii) to assess sediment build-up in the check-dam reservoir. Field campaigns were carried out to measure water flow, water depth, and check-dam topography to establish water volume, evaporation, outflow, and recharge relations, as well as sediment build-up. To quantify the groundwater recharge, a water-balance approach was applied at two locations: at the check dam reservoir area and at an 11 km long natural stretch of the river upstream. Prediction intervals were computed to assess the uncertainties of the results. During the four years of operation, the check dam (storage capacity of 25, 000 m 3) recharged the aquifer with an average of 3. 1 million m 3 of the 10. 4 million m 3 year− 1 of streamflow (30 %). The lower and upper uncertainty limits of the check dam recharge were 0. 1 and 9. 6 million m 3 year− 1, respectively. Recharge from the <b>upstream</b> <b>stretch</b> was 1. 5 million m 3 year− 1.

40|$|This study aims to {{optimize}} the water quality monitoring of a polluted watercourse (Leça River, Portugal) through the principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). These statistical methodologies were applied to physicochemical, bacteriological and ecotoxicological data (with the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri and the green alga Chlorella vulgaris) obtained with the analysis of water samples monthly collected at seven monitoring sites and during five campaigns (February, May, June, August, and September 2006). The results of some variables were assigned to water quality classes according to national guidelines. Chemical and bacteriological quality data led to classify Leça River water quality as “bad” or “very bad”. PCA and CA identified monitoring sites with similar pollution pattern, giving to site 1 (located in the <b>upstream</b> <b>stretch</b> of the river) a distinct feature from all other sampling sites downstream. Ecotoxicity results corroborated this classification thus revealing differences in space and time. The present study includes not only physical, chemical and bacteriological but also ecotoxicological parameters, which broadens new perspectives in river water characterization. Moreover, the application of PCA and CA is very useful {{to optimize}} water quality monitoring networks, defining the minimum number of sites and their location.

40|$|Telomerase {{serves a}} dual role at telomeres, {{maintaining}} tracts of telomere repeats and forming telomeres de novo on broken chromosomes {{in a process}} called chromosome healing. In ciliates, both mechanisms are readily observed. Vegetatively growing cells maintain pre-existing telomeres, while cells undergoing macronuclear development fragment their chromosomes and form telomeres de novo. Here we provide the first evidence for developmentally regulated initiation of DNA synthesis by telomerase. In vitro assays were conducted with telomerase from vegetative and developing Euplotes macronuclei using chimeric primers that contained non-telomeric 3 ' ends and an <b>upstream</b> <b>stretch</b> of telomeric DNA. In developing macronuclei, chimeric primers had two fates: nucleotides were either polymerized directly onto the 3 ' terminus or residues {{were removed from the}} 3 ' end by endonucleolytic cleavage before polymerization began. In contrast, telomerase from vegetative macronuclei used only the cleavage pathway. Telomere repeat addition onto non-telomeric 3 ' ends was lost when developing macronuclei were lysed and the contents purified on glycerol gradients. However, when fractions from the glycerol gradient were added back to partially purified telomerase, telomere synthesis was restored. The data indicate that a dissociable chromosome healing factor (CHF) collaborates with telomerase to initiate developmentally programmed de novo telomere formation...|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim: There is {{a limited}} number of methods to measure blood flow {{velocity}} in small veins. A cheap and simple new videomicroscopic method developed in our laboratories is described in the paper. Methods: A stretch of the saphenous vein of the rat was exposed by careful micropreparation on the thigh of anesthetized animals. Bolus amount (approx. 5 μl) of saline was infused into a small side branch through a microcannula to dilute flowing blood. Videomicroscopic picture of the vein was then taken of the exposed <b>upstream</b> <b>stretch</b> of the vein. Serial pictures were digitized and analyzed using macro functions of the Image J software. Sensitive areas of serial pictures were selected and fitted. Consecutive pictures were subtracted from each other to better characterize their alteration in-between frames. Greyscale intensity values measured at different points of the inner diameter were averaged for each point of the vessel axis. Cross-correlations along the axis were then computed for consecutive frames with delays of 40, 80, 120 and 160 msec. Pixel offsets producing cross-correlation maxima were determined and used to compute mean flow velocity. Results: Combination of digital subtraction and cross-correlation computations yielded easily identifiable maximums. Mean flow velocities could be determined with limited uncertainty. Conclusion: The described technique gives a cheap, simple and reproducible mean to determine mean blood flow velocities in small veins in anesthetized animals, where other current techniques (ultrasonography, laser-Doppler, fluorescently labelled red cell movement) are either expensive or can be applied with difficulty only...|$|E
40|$|Decades of {{commercial}} planting and other anthropogenic processes are posing {{a threat to}} the riparian landscapes of the Cauvery river basin, which supports a high floral diversity. Despite this, the habitats in the upstream sections of the River Cauvery are still intact, as they are located in sacred groves. To understand the dynamism of riparian forests exposed to anthropogenic pressures, the <b>upstream</b> <b>stretch</b> of Cauvery extending from Kushalanagara to Talacauvery (~ 102 km) was categorized into two landscapes: agro ecosystem and sacred (i. e. preserved). The tree species were sampled using belt transects at 5 km intervals and the regeneration status of endemic species assessed using quadrats. A total of 128 species belonging to 47 families, and representing 1, 590 individuals, was observed. Amongst them, 65 of unique species were exclusive to sacred landscapes. A rarefaction plot confirmed higher species richness for the sacred compared to the agro ecosystem landscapes, and diversity indices with more evenness in distribution were evident in sacred landscapes. A significant loss of endemic tree species in the agro ecosystem landscapes was found. Overall, this study demonstrates that an intense biotic pressure in terms of plantations and other anthropogenic activities have altered the species composition of the riparian zone in non-sacred areas. A permanent policy implication is required for the conservation of riparian buffers to avoid further ecosystem degradation and loss of biodiversity.

40|$|Zones {{of erosion}} and {{accretion}} were delimited by comparing a DGPS shoreline mapping in 1997 {{and the beach}} line reproduced from the army chart collection of 1975. The results show extensive shore retreat along of Rio Grande do Sul central coast, while accretion was observed in Mostardas and Dunas Altas beach. Mathematical estimative of the regional longshore transport potential along the Rio Grande do Sul coast, a 630 -km long holocenic fine sand barrier, resulted in a large net northward annual sand volume. Additionally, the estimated potential of sediment transport based on the CERC formula predicts a substantial variation of the energy flux into the surf zone, due to little changes in shoreline alignments and in the potential alongshore sediment transport. The reduction in the sediment flux due {{to changes in the}} shoreline alignment produce a jam in the longshore transport, meaning that part of the sediment arriving from the <b>upstream</b> <b>stretch</b> may be deposited or diverted offshore by coastal jet. Based on that, it is possible that changes in the net longshore sand transport are responsible for the increase in the shoreface width from less than 1 km to more than 3 km in Mostardas beach and Dunas Altas beach. Interesting to note that wider dune fields are associated to those beaches where shoreface is also wider. In this way, the volume of longshore sand transport and the sediment jam provide by changes on shoreline alignment in Mostardas and Dunas Altas beaches are important for both coastal dune fields and shoreface width...|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of the coastal region, its resources and stakeholder rights are treated in isolation from the associated river basins {{in most of the}} countries across the world. Incorporating the coastal stretch {{as an integral part of}} the basin becomes necessary due to the reciprocal relationships that exist between the coastal 'tail-end' ecosystems and <b>upstream</b> <b>stretches.</b> The present study addresses the challenges involved in integrating the coastal zones into the Integrated River Basin Management (IRBM) framework, especially in developing countries like India. As a part of this study, the river basins and their coastal watersheds in the west coast of India, a highly bio-diverse and densely populated region, is delineated using multiple high resolution datasets. A case study of one of the western coastal tracts is also attempted to identify the boundaries that have to be considered in the coastal zones for basin delineation. The ambiguities in the coastal drainage and floodplain boundaries due to the numerous cross-linkages that exist with the neighbouring estuaries, the multitude of small independent coastal catchments and asymmetries between surface and groundwater boundaries present difficulties in undertaking a strict hydrological delineation in the study region. Apart from these natural boundaries, various administrative/political units, coastal management frameworks, resource dependencies and livelihoods present additional boundary concerns for sustainable coastal management within IRBM. Taking these multiple boundaries of the coastal zone into account within the river basin regime becomes essential for resource sharing and legitimate interventions in upstream basin decisions that jeopardise the coastal ecosystem and livelihoods.
