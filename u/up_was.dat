5|$|In 1948 Kathleen married Frank Cole, a World War II veteran, {{and moved}} the family to Virginia.

5|$|One of the {{principal}} technologies that enabled an aircraft {{as large as the}} 747 to be drawn <b>up</b> <b>was</b> the high-bypass turbofan engine.

General Electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the C-5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later. Pratt & Whitney was also working on the same principle and, by late 1966, Boeing, Pan Am and Pratt & Whitney agreed to develop a new engine, designated the JT9D to power the 747.|$|E
