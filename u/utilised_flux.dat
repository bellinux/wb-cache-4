40|$|We {{study the}} {{consequences}} of cancellation of cubic Abelian anomalies in F-theory GUT models that <b>utilise</b> hypercharge <b>flux</b> {{in the presence of}} additional U(1) symmetries. We show that a mixed anomaly between the hypercharge and two U(1) gauge fields is not automatically canceled in local models based on the spectral cover and therefore imposes additional constraints on local models in F-theory that have not been accounted for so far. The constraints imply that there are only two possible classes of models in F-theory GUTs which have fields on matter curves in non-complete GUT representations that are not vector-like under all U(1) s: the ones based on a 3 + 2 and 2 + 2 + 1 split. We comment on some phenomenological implications of these results for realising NMSSM-like models from F-theory GUTs.

This necessitates that close {{attention is paid}} to the quality of bearings utilised and the stiffness and accuracy of rotor. Drive for the alternator is normally provided by a standard induction motor for convention and simplicity. Both vertical and horizontal configurations are utilised and in most cases the motor rotor and generator rotor are mounted on a common shaft with no coupling. The whole assembly is then mounted in a frame containing the motor stator and generator stator. The whole construction is mounted in a cubicle which features a heat exchanger and water cooling systems as required.|$|R

We propose a radically new approach that combines the recently introduced techniques of parameter estimation based observers (PEBO) with the dynamic regression extension and mixing (DREM) parameter adaptation. The PEBO framework is used to recast the flux observation task as a parameter estimation problem, for which the DREM technique is <b>utilised.</b> The resulting <b>flux</b> observer is then combined with a standard gradient estimator for the rotor resistance.

40|$|A {{search for}} {{particles}} carrying an electric charge one third {{that of the}} electronic charge (quarks) {{has been carried out}} close to the core of extensive air showers. The search was conducted at sea-level using a large volume flash tube chamber. The technique employed utilised these nativity of flash tubes to particle ionisation. Air showers were selected by requiring the local electron density above the detector to exceed 40 m (^- 40) with this trigger the apparatus has been operated for 2570 hours. No definite quark tracks have been observed, the upper limit on the quark flux being set at 8. 0 x 10 (^- 11) cm (^- 2) sec (^- 1) st (^- 1). In the same experiment, the energy spectra of charged and neutral nuclear-active particles in extensive air showers of mean shower size 2. 0 x ` 0 (^ 5) has been measured. A method has been developed for estimating the energies of the particles from the width of the nuclear-electromagnetic cascade resulting from the interactions, as measured in flash tubes below the absorbers. The results have been related to extensive air shower characteristics; in particular to the nuclear-physical aspects of very high energy collisions. The flash tube chamber has been modified to allow the relationship between the width of the nuclear-electromagnetic cascade and the energy of the interacting particle to be established. The experiment, <b>utilising</b> the <b>flux</b> of unaccompanied hadrons in the near-vertical direction, has also allowed the energy spectrum of these particles to be determined up to energies of ITeV...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{absorption}} {{solar collectors}} offer possible improvement in efficiency over traditional surface absorbing collectors, {{because they have}} fewer heat transfer steps and {{has the ability to}} <b>utilise</b> higher radiation <b>fluxes.</b> Carbon black based nanofluids, in a base fluid of salt water, were synthesised by a two-step method where the carbon black nanoparticles were treated with a surfactant, TWEEN- 20, in a 1 : 2 mass ratio and sonicated for 60 minutes to break up agglomerates. The synthesised nanofluids showed stability for over 31 days. The different carbon black concentration nanofluids' solar irradiation absorption properties were compared {{with each other and with}} the base fluid of salt water in a concentrating, as well as non-concentration scenario. It was found that the carbon black nanofluids showed excellent absorption properties over the entire solar radiation spectrum. A 1 m 2 concentrating unit using a two-axis tracking system, with two mirrors and a 1 m diameter circular Fresnel lens, was used to concentrate solar radiation on a direct absorption solar collector flow cell with a 10 cm 2 collection area. An optimum concentration of 0. 001 volume % carbon black was found to show a 42 % increase in heating rate, compared to that of salt water. The collector was, however, hampered by high energy losses and the maximum collector efficiency achieved was only 46 %, 23 % higher than that of salt water. The overall system efficiency was only 22 %. This low efficiency can be attributed to the high optical concentration losses (50 % - 70 %) present in the concentrating unit.

40|$|Magnetic {{non-destructive}} methods <b>utilising</b> the Magnetic <b>Flux</b> Leakage (MFL) and Magnetic Barkhausen Noise (MBN) phenomena {{are widely}} used {{in the evaluation of}} the structural integrity of steel components. The MFL method is effectively applied for in-service flaw monitoring of oil and gas pipelines, fuel storage tank floors and rails; whereas the MBN method, due to high sensitivity of Barkhausen emission to residual and applied stress, {{has become one of the}} most popular NDE tools for investigating this condition of steels. Despite the affirming research and successful applications, which helped these methods to gain acceptance as a viable non-destructive tools, there is still a requirement for establishing a quantitative links between magnetic and mechanical properties of steel which would enable their further understanding and optimisation. In this thesis the applications of MFL and MBN methods for flaw and stress detection are analysed via analytical and numerical modelling. A new model relating the MBN amplitude and stress for materials having different magnetostrictive behaviour under load is proposed and validated in the quantitative stress evaluation of different grades of steel. Moreover, a new method for determining depth dependence of stress from measured magnetic Barkhausen signals is presented. A complete set of newly derived equations describing the detected Barkhausen signals in terms of the actual emissions that are generated inside the material and how these appear when they propagate to the surface is given. The results from finite element modelling of magnetic flux leakage signals above unflawed and flawed rails energised in various directions are presented. These results enabled to identify the most effective current injection procedure and optimise the probability of transverse flaw detection in the rail inspection. The agreement between modelled and measured electromagnetic signals indicating presence of transverse rail defects has been justified...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} three reluctance {{machines with}} flux assistance. These machines provide alternative novel geometries that provide high efficiencies with {{a reduction in}} the ampere turns in the armature windings for torque production, lowering armature winding switching losses and reducing the power electronic rating. The Dual Stack Variable Reluctance Machine is a switched reluctance variant of the homopolar inductor alternator topology. The Single Stack Variable Reluctance Machine is a simplification of the Dual Stack machine. Both machines use a toroidal field winding to provide additional flux. The methods of connecting armature coils on each stator pole to <b>utilise</b> the armature <b>flux</b> and the choice of power electronic circuitry are important. Testing shows that such machines favour unipolar excitation with single coil per pole for the armature windings. Use of the field winding in series with the armature windings improves torque production. The Dual Stack Variable Reluctance Machine can have the mechanical angular displacement between the two stator stacks varied to provide an improved back emf waveshape for smoother torque production. The Single Stack Variable Reluctance Machine has parasitic and axial air gaps that pose interesting design issues (e. g. end thrust). Magnets can be placed in steel sections where flux is unidirectional. An ideal candidate for magnet insertion is the Flux Switching Motor. A Permanent Magnet Flux Switching Motor has been built that replaces the field windings with ferrite magnets. The Permanent Magnet Flux Switching Motor achieves efficiencies of over 80 %. It adds no additional cost to the fan application as cost savings in lower temperature rated thermoplastics offsets the cost of magnets. A prototyping circuit incorporating a novel micro-processor program to alter the commutation timings as the machine operates has been designed to allow fast optimisation of each machine for minimum input power. ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop and improve the experimental method and data interpretation for strain measurements using diffraction methods {{to gain a better understanding}} of micromechanical deformation and anisotropy of lattice strain response. Substantial part of the research was devoted to the development of the laboratory high energy X-ray diffractometer (HEXameter) for bulk residual strain evaluation. White beam energy dispersive X-ray diffraction was chosen as the principal diffraction mode due to its extreme efficiency in <b>utilising</b> X-ray <b>flux</b> and its ability to capture large segments of diffraction patterns. The specimens that have been examined were real engineering components, mechanically deformed specimens and thermally treated specimens, ranging from dynamic in-situ measurements to ex-situ materials engineering. For the real engineering components, a wedge coupon from the trailing edge of a Ti 64 wide fan blade and a turbine combustion casing were examined. Among the mechanically deformed specimens that have been measured were shot-peened steel plates, elasto-plastically bent bars of Mg alloy and cold expanded Al disks. Amongst the thermally deformed specimens, laser-formed steel plates, thermal spray coatings, a manual inert gas weld of Al plates, a friction stir weld of Al plates and Ni tubes and a quenched Ni superalloy cylinder used for strain tomography were studied. In-situ loading experiments have also been carried out, such as experiments on pointwise mapping of grain orientation and strain using the 3 DXRD microscope at the ESRF and in-situ loading experiments on titanium alloy, rheo-diecast and high pressure diecast Mg alloy, IN 718 Ni-base superalloy and Al 2024 aluminium alloy. Experimental results from X-Ray diffraction and strain tomography were used to achieve a better understanding of the material properties. Some results were compared with polycrystal Finite Element model predictions. Amongst the most prominent research achievements are the development on the HEXameter laboratory instrument, including: (i) the development of special collimation systems for the detectors and the source tube; (ii) the development of a twin-detector setup (that allows for simultaneous determination of strain in two mutually orthogonal directions); (iii) improved alignment procedures for better performance; and (iv) the adaptation of instrumentation for efficient scanning of both large and small components, that included choosing and adapting translation devices, programming of the translation system and designing sample mounting procedures. In {{this research}} several approaches to data treatment were investigated. Quantitative phase analysis, single peak fitting (using custom Matlab routines and GSAS) and full pattern fitting (with individual pattern data refined by GSAS and batch refinement done by invoking GSAS via a Matlab routine) were applied. Different Matlab routines were written for specific experimental setups; and various analysis methods were selected and used for refinement depending on the requirements of the measurement results interpretation. 16 papers were published, ensuring that the results of this thesis are readily available to other researchers in the field.

40|$|AbstractFollowing the {{drilling}} of a shallow natural CO 2 reservoir at the Qinghai research site, west of Haidong, China, {{it was discovered}} that CO 2 was continuously leaking from the wellbore due to well-failure. The site has become a useful research facility in China for studying CO 2 leakage and monitoring technologies for application to geological storage sites of CO 2. During an eight day period in 2014, soil gas and soil flux surveys were conducted to characterise the distribution, magnitude and likely source of the leaking CO 2. Two different sampling patterns were <b>utilised</b> during soil <b>flux</b> surveys. A regular sampling grid was used to spatially map out the two high-flux zones which were located 20 – 50 m away from the wellhead. An irregular sampling grid, with higher sampling density in the high-flux zones, allowed for more accurate mapping of the leak distribution and estimation of total field emission rate using cubic interpolation. The total CO 2 emission rate for the site was estimated at 649 - 1015 kgCO 2 /d and there appeared to be some degree of spatial correlation between observed CO 2 fluxes and elevated surface H 2 O fluxes. Sixteen soil gas wells were installed across the field to test the real-time application of Romanak et al. ’s (2012) process-based approach for soil gas measurements (using ratios of major soil gas components to identify the CO 2 source) using a portable multi-gas analyser. Results clearly identified CO 2 as being derived from one exogenous source, and are consistent with gas samples collected for laboratory analysis. Carbon- 13 isotopes in the centre of each leak zone (− 0. 21 ‰ and − 0. 22 ‰) indicate the underlying CO 2 is likely sourced from the thermal decomposition of marine carbonates. Surface soil mineralisation (predominantly calcite) can be used to infer prior distribution of the CO 2 hotspots and as a consequence highlighted plume migration of 20 m in 11 years. The broadening of the affected area beyond the wellbore at the Qinghai research site markedly increases the area that needs surveying at sufficient density to detect a leak. This challenges the role of soil gas and soil flux in a CCS monitoring and verification program for leak detection, suggesting that these techniques may be better applied for characterising the source and emission rate of a CO 2 leak, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Hypersonic high {{enthalpy}} separated flows {{over two}} configurations, a rearward facing step and a compression corner were numerically investigated using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD). Separated flow over the rearward facing step was studied at two enthalpies, 26 MJ/kg and 50 MJ/kg, corresponding to suborbital and superorbital speeds. The shock wave/boundary layer interaction and separation at the compression corner were studied at low and moderate enthalpies of 3 MJ/kg and 20 MJ/kg respectively. The numerical results have been compared to the available experimental data obtained in the X 2 expansion tube facility which generates suborbital and superorbital speeds. The compression corner experimental data was obtained in the T 3 free piston driven shock tunnel. In both these studies the flow medium was air. Two CFD codes, MB-CNS- 2 and Eilmer- 3, which primarily solve time-accurate Navier-Stokes equations were used to investigate the flow fields <b>utilising</b> AUSMDV <b>flux</b> splitting method. The perfect gas and chemical nonequilibrium calculations used MB-CNS- 2, and the chemical plus thermal nonequilibrium, Eilmer- 3. The chemical nonequilibrium behaviour of the gas was based on Guptas kinetic scheme, whereas the thermo-chemical nonequilibrium was based on Parks two-temperature model. The computational flow establishments over attached and separated flows under suborbital and superorbital conditions suggested that the flow requires a longer time to establish than was available for testing in the X 2 facility. Heat flux comparisons with experiments over the flat plate showed fair agreement and indicated that the boundary layer was essentially chemically and thermally frozen. In the close vicinity of the step, {{the presence of the}} Goldstein Singularity over the lip was observed and separation occurred {{on the face of the}} step. The separation moved further down the face with decrease in Reynolds number. A pressure minimum was shown to develop close to the location of separation as a result of over expansion followed by a recompression to the base pressure through a lip shock. Between separation and reattachment, the effects of chemical reactions were found to be negligible and the species were essentially frozen. A small region of thermal equilibrium prevailed close to the bottom corner of the step. Downstream of the step, the computed heat flux showed reasonable agreement with experiments. Computations with a rounded corner step configuration showed an increase in heat flux, skin friction and pressure between separation and reattachment with the increase in corner radius. In particular, the base pressure increased by nearly 30 % for a fully rounded corner compared with a sharp corner in suborbital flow, while, in superorbital flow, it increased by a factor of 10. The increase in base pressure with increase in corner radius appears to be due, firstly, to the decrease in the strength of the expansion (resulting in a less steeper fall in pressure) and secondly, due to the formation of the recompression shock nearer to the base. The effects of chemistry were again found to be insignificant in the separated region. Computed flow visualisations showed that the shear layer at separation gradually became parallel to the plate as the radius increased. The compression corner results for the higher enthalpy flow showed that the separation, reattachment and recirculation regions were affected by chemical reactions. The heat flux and pressure comparisons with experiments for attached, incipiently separated and fully separated flows, suggested that CFD can reasonably predict the laminar shock boundary/layer interaction in the separated region at the corner. Significant differences were noted downstream over the ramp surface, particularly in regard to both locations and magnitudes of the peak heat flux and pressure and in the subsequent distributions of both heat flux and pressure. Under low enthalpy conditions, a similar situation was noted but chemical reactions were insignificant. The Eilmer- 3 code was also used on the well known double cone configuration and the results were compared with the bench mark experimental data and previous CFD simulations based on steady solutions. The comparison of the present CFD data with these previous CFD and experimental data was fair at best highlighting not only the need for refined grids but also the difference between the time dependent and steady state approaches...|$|R
40|$|The United Nations {{expects the}} world’s urban {{population}} to double by 2050 and as cities expand, {{the replacement of}} natural land-covers (e. g. soil and vegetation) by impervious surfaces (e. g. concrete, asphalt, and metal) will have significant environmental consequences, including reduction in evapotranspiration, more rapid surface runoff, development of an urban heat island (UHI), and reduction in air and water quality. The monitoring of these urban conditions is necessary to guide sustainable urban growth in a socially and environmentally sensible manner and remote sensing technology may provide a time- and cost-effective means to map and monitor several key variables. This study developed and evaluated an approach for mapping urban materials with Quickbird satellite data and lidar using pixel-based and object-based image classification techniques on a subset of Brisbane, in Queensland, Australia. Most urban mapping studies using multi-spectral imagery have mapped cities at broad categories of land use/land-cover but this study selected map classes at a more detailed level. The mapping level focussed on the materials {{that make up the}} surfaces in urban environments for which there are known emissivity values, which could be used to map urban energy exchanges. This created the potential to utilise the results from this work to model surface energy fluxes, and consequently, land surface temperature in a subsequent study. The ability of the local government in Brisbane to utilise a fast and economical approach to obtaining temperature information at a fine spatial scale, i. e. with pixels < 10 m, would help to improve city planning decisions and mitigate the adverse effects of urbanisation on the environment. Quickbird imagery, which has proven useful for urban mapping applications because of its high-spatial resolution, was used in this study. Lidar data, which have also been successfully used in urban mapping, were incorporated in the classification process with the Quickbird imagery. The classification methods of this study began with pixel-based classification, then object-based classification, and finished with an integration of the two. Each classification step {{played a key role in}} identifying the best data, method, and scale parameters (for object-based methods) for use in the final step of the methodology. First, the pixel-based classification determined a suitable level of detail for map classes and identified which additional image bands were best for discriminating the selected classes. This method had high accuracy but a great deal of the salt and pepper effect, with many real-world image objects (e. g. roads and building roofs) misclassified as a mix of various materials. The misclassifications of this method were attributed to spectral overlap between classes and lack of strong normal distributions for the classes within the individual image bands. Two object-based classifications determined the appropriate scale parameters for image segmentation and the best object features for identifying the urban materials classes. The standard nearest neighbour classification had the lowest overall accuracy and poor delineation of real-world objects, particularly within dense residential areas. This resulted from use of only one segmentation level and one set of object features for the classification of all image objects. The second object-based classification utilised a stepwise method that classified image objects in a hierarchical manner. This method showed improvement from the previous classifications and successfully delineated most of the urban materials; improvement was attributed to the use of multiple object levels and unique object features in each class description. Error assessments, conducted using standard error matrices for all classifications, identified strengths and weaknesses of each mapping approach. Across all methods, natural materials (e. g. water and trees) as a whole had the highest classification accuracies, while built materials (e. g. concrete and metal) had the lowest. The pixel-based classification had the highest overall accuracy and the standard nearest neighbour classification had the lowest. The stepwise classification achieved comparable accuracy to the pixel-based classification but with less salt and pepper and improved identification of real-world features. Thus, the final approach developed for mapping urban materials integrated pixel-based and object-based classification methods which allowed spectral values as well as colour/shape/class-related features to be utilised on multiple object levels, with unique class descriptions for each urban material. The integrated classification had high overall accuracy and provided the best delineation of real-world image objects. Though the developed mapping approach was only tested on a small subset of Brisbane, this area contained a good representation of the materials present within urban environments and also utilised band ratios, thereby improving the ability for these rule-sets to be applied to other urban regions. Follow-up studies will determine the actual success of the mapping approach on additional sites and the suitability of the results from this work to be <b>utilised</b> for energy <b>flux</b> modelling...|$|R
