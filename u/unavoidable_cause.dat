40|$|As {{air traffic}} {{congestion}} grows, air traffic flow management (ATFM) is becoming a great concern. ATFM deals with air traffic and the efficient utilization of the airport and airspace. Air traffic efficiency is heavily influenced by unanticipated factors, or uncertainties, which can come from several sources such as mechanical breakdown; however, weather is the main <b>unavoidable</b> <b>cause</b> of uncertainty. Because weather is unpredictable, it poses a critical challenge for ATFM in current airport and airspace operations. Convective weather results in congestion at airports {{as well as in}} airspace sectors. During times of congestion, the decision as how and when to send aircraft toward an airspace sector in the presence of weather is difficult. To approach this problem, we first propose a two-stage stochastic integer program by emphasizing a given single sector. By considering ground delay, cancellation, and cruise speed for each flight {{on the ground in the}} first stage, as well as air holding and diversion recourse actions for each flight in the air in the second stage, our model determines how aircraft are sent toward a sector under the uncertainty of weather. However, due to the large number of weather scenarios, the model is intractable in practice. To overcome the intractability, we suggest a rolling horizon method to solve the problem to near optimal. Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient method are used to justify the rolling horizon method. Since the rolling horizon method can be solved in real time, we can apply it to actual aircraft schedules to reduce the costs incurred on the ground as well as in airspace. We then extend our two-stage model to a multistage stochastic program, which increases the number of possible weather realizations and results a more efficient schedule in terms of costs. The rolling horizon method as well as Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient method are applied to this multistage model. An overall comparison among the previously described methodologies are presented. Ph. D.

This study was aimed to clarify the independent impact of UA on the subsequent risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by a propensity score analysis. A retrospective CKD cohort was used (n = 803). Baseline 23 covariates were subjected to a multivariate binary logistic regression with the targeted time-averaged UA of 6. 0, 6. 5 or 7. 0 mg/dL. The participants trimmed 2. 5 percentile from the extreme ends of the cohort underwent propensity score analyses consisting of matching, stratification on quintile and covariate adjustment. Covariate balances after 1 : 1 matching without replacement were tested for by paired analysis and standardized differences. A stratified Cox regression and a Cox regression adjusted for logit of propensity scores were examined. After propensity score matching, the higher UA showed elevated hazard ratios (HRs) by Kaplan-Meier analysis (≥ 6. 0 mg/dL, HR 4. 53, 95 %CI 1. 79 - 11. 43; ≥ 6. 5 mg/dL, HR 3. 39, 95 %CI 1. 55 - 7. 42; ≥ 7. 0 mg/dL, HR 2. 19, 95 %CI 1. 28 - 3. 75). The number needed to treat was 8 to 9 over 5 years. A stratified Cox regression likewise showed significant crude HRs (≥ 6. 0 mg/dL, HR 3. 63, 95 %CI 1. 25 - 10. 58; ≥ 6. 5 mg/dL, HR 3. 46, 95 %CI 1. 56 - 7. 68; ≥ 7. 0 mg/dL, HR 2. 05, 95 %CI 1. 21 - 3. 48). Adjusted HR lost its significance at 6. 0 mg/dL. The adjustment for the logit of the propensity scores showed the similar results but with worse model fittings than the stratification method. Upon further adjustment for other covariates the significance was attained at 6. 5 mg/dL. Three different methods of the propensity score analysis showed consistent results that the higher UA accelerates the progression to the subsequent ESRD. A stratified Cox regression outperforms other methods in generalizability and adjusting for residual bias. Serum UA should be targeted less than 6. 5 mg/dL...|$|E

40|$|Corrosion {{within the}} oil and gas sector is an ongoing concern for operators. The {{challenging}} nature of extraction and processing fluids is an <b>unavoidable</b> <b>cause</b> of severe metallic corrosion. With modern emphasis on health, safety and the environment, the case for managing corrosion has become an imperative agenda. Whilst new and more effective methods of mitigation are key, an interim solution is improving the value of current methods. A literature survey carried out within this project has revealed CO 2 corrosion as contributing to most corrosion related failures within the industry. The corrosion behaviour in CO 2 containing environments is complex partly due to the wide range of prevailing conditions such as temperature, CO 2 concentration and flow conditions. For oil and gas transportation pipelines, internal corrosion mitigation can be achieved by the use of chemical inhibitors. Inhibitors have been established to be effective but are by no means a complete solution. Issues such as their effectiveness in high velocity and high shear flow are a main consideration for their function. The hydrodynamic nature of the flowing fluids can affect inhibitor efficiency by either slowing the rate of formation of the inhibitive layer or causing degradation of well-formed inhibitive layers. A combined effect may also be active. The corrosion behaviour of carbon steel in simulated oilfield conditions is investigated in this project with emphasis on conditions of varying velocity, impinging flow and consequently shear stress. Since inhibition is the main mitigation technique for fluid related corrosion, the efficiency of a commercially used inhibitor is, in this case assessed in the abovementioned conditions. To simulate both impingement and flow, a jet impingement apparatus is used in conjunction with a segmented-electrode specimen set up to separately study the erosion-corrosion behaviour of different hydrodynamic zones under the jet. Corrosion rates are measured by gravimetric analysis and results are also evaluated with electrochemistry. Additionally, galvanic interactions between the different hydrodynamic zones have been investigated. Visual and light-optical microscopic examinations are also used to assess variable effects within the zones. Under such conditions, the corrosion rates {{have been found to be}} significantly higher in impingement zones. Aerated conditions have shown a significant variation in corrosion behaviour between impingement and non-impingement zones. The results in CO 2 saturated brines are consistent but with evidence of different relations between hydrodynamics and the corrosion rate. The inhibitor has been shown to be effective in CO 2 saturated brines and significantly influenced by both inhibitor concentration and hydrodynamic conditions. Inhibitor efficiency has also shown a complex dependence on concentration and establishes a need to evaluate optimum inhibitor concentrations before field application. Evaluation of the mass loss results against electrochemistry has shown a large discrepancy between the two methods. This rather surprising result suggests solid-free flow is not entirely free of erosion and synergistic effects. This comprehensive study has not only improved current knowledge on the relation between hydrodynamics and inhibitor efficiency but also indicates a critical need to evaluate suitability of current monitoring methods. Electrochemical methods are increasingly used as a method of choice and while they contribute significant monitoring data, they are observed to be unable, alone, to monitor erosion and synergy. An industry review on their suitability to monitor solid-free flow corrosion is recommended. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{analyze the}} {{characteristics}} of neonatal deaths atHospital Geral Grajaú, in 2002, and assess the influence of perinatalfactors in mortality. METHODS: A retrospective and descriptivestudy, including all births that took place at Hospital Geral do Grajaú,in the city of São Paulo, in 2002, totaling 2, 694 newborns. Thecauses of death were classified as “maternal-related”, “fetusrelated”,“delivery-related”, “newborn-related”, and “institutional”causes. They were also classified as avoidable and unavoidableregarding institutional resources. The chi-square test (p < 0. 05) was applied to study anoxia and mortality data. RESULTS: Thepercentage of death among all liveborn neonates was 1. 19 %; inthat, 52 % with extremely low birth weight, 34. 48 % with very lowbirth weight, and 7. 22 % with low birth weight babies. Theextremely-low-birth-weight neonates (weight < 1, 000 g) represented 0. 93 % of the live-borns and 40. 62 % of the deaths. The very-low-birth-weight babies (weight < 1, 500 g) accountedfor 2. 16 % of the population studied and 62. 49 % of the deaths;whereas the low-birth-weight neonates (weight < 2, 500 g) represented 13. 36 % of the live-borns and 81. 23 % of the deaths. Mortality by specific weight decreased in all groups except for the 2, 500 - 4, 000 g group, which presented a rate higher than theprevious groups (in absolute numbers) for comprising moreneonates. Most deaths occurred in the first 7 days of life, and 25 %, after 28 days. Neonatal mortality rate was 8. 91 % 0. Earlyneonatal mortality rate was 6. 31 % 0 and late hospital neonatalmortality rate was 2. 60 % 0. Intrauterine infection, malformation, andsevere anoxia accounted for 56. 27 % {{of the causes of}} death.
