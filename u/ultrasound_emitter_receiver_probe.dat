40|$|In this article, we {{consider}} a generalized Radon transform {{that comes up}} in ultrasound reflection tomography. In our model, the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>emitter</b> and <b>receiver</b> move at a constant distance apart along a circle. We analyze the microlocal properties of the transform $R$ that arises from this model. As a consequence, we show that for distributions with support sufficiently inside the circle, $R^*R$ is an elliptic pseudodifferential operator of order $- 1 $ and hence all the singularities of such distributions can be recovered...|$|R

The B-scan, with time and scan position axes, contains parabolic features characteristic of a point-like scatterer. Human vision effectively detects these shapes, but this is time consuming and requires training. A parabola matched filter has been developed that is simple to implement and transforms parabolic shapes to peaks whilst reducing noise in the scan. The scan can then be displayed as depth versus lateral position...|$|R
40|$|Pulse-inversion (PI) {{sequences}} {{are sensitive}} to the nonlinear echoes from microbubbles allowing an improvement in the blood-to-tissue contrast. However, at larger mechanical indices, this contrast is reduced by harmonics produced during nonlinear propagation. A method for tissue harmonics cancellation exploiting time reversal is experimentally implemented using a 128 -channel 12 -bit <b>emitter</b> <b>receiver.</b> The <b>probe</b> calibration is performed by acquiring the nonlinear echo of a wire in water. These distorted pulses are time-reversed, optimized and used for the PI imaging of a tissue phantom. Compared to normal (straight) pulses, the time-reversed distorted pulses reduced the tissue signal in PI by 11 dB. The second harmonic signals from microbubbles flowing in a wall-less vessel were unaffected by the correction. This technique can thus increase the blood-to-tissue contrast ratio while keeping the pressure and the number of pulses constant.

40|$|One {{challenge}} of wearable computing is {{the design and}} use of interaction devices for wearable applications that are accepted by users. In our previous work, the Winspect [1] project, a wearable system for crane maintenance was constructed that used a multitude of cable connections to attach a data glove interaction device, an external battery pack, <b>ultrasound</b> <b>emitters</b> and <b>receivers,</b> a RFID scanner, and a head-mounted display, to a wearable computer. However, {{the presence of these}} cable connections led to the rejection of the Winspect prototype by the industrial partner due to work safety considerations. In order to close the gap between a multitude of devices that are connected to a wearable computer by cable and a textile electronics system that integrates all sensing capabilities into the textile fabric, sensor-boards are needed. With SCIPIO, we built a sensor interface system as a basis for building various wearable interaction devices. SCIPIO’s features include • small size and lightweight • multitude of analogue and digital inputs and outputs • Bluetooth wireless communication interfac...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} of {{classification}} and localization of reflectors, using the time-of-flight (TOF) {{data obtained from}} ultrasonic transducers, is presented. The method of classification and localization is based on Generalized Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) applied to the TOF values obtained from a sensor that contains four <b>ultrasound</b> <b>emitters</b> and 16 <b>receivers.</b> Since PCA works with vectorized representations of TOF, {{it does not take}} into account the spatial locality of receivers. The GPCA works with two-dimensional representations of TOF, taking into account information on the spatial position of the receivers. This report includes a detailed description of the method of classification and localization and the results of achieved tests with three types of reflectors in 3 -D environments: planes, edges, and corners. The results in terms of processing time, classification and localization were very satisfactory for the reflectors located in the range of 50 – 350 cm...|$|R

40|$|Herbivore-induced {{volatiles}} are {{widespread in}} plants. They {{can serve as}} alert signals that enable neighbouring leaves and plants to pre-emptively increase defences and avoid herbivory damage. However, our understanding about the factors mediating volatile organic compound (VOC) signal interpretation by receiver plants {{and the degree to}} which multiple herbivores affect VOC signals is still limited. Here we investigated whether plant responses to damage-induced VOC signals were population specific. As a secondary goal, we tested for interference in signal production or reception when plants were subjected to multiple types of herbivore damage. We factorially crossed the population sources of paired Phaseolus lunatus plants (same vs. different population sources) with a mechanical damage treatment to one member of the pair (i. e. the VOC emitter, damaged vs. control), and we measured herbivore damage to the other plant (the VOC receiver) in the field. Prior to the experiment, both <b>emitter</b> and <b>receiver</b> plants were naturally colonized by aphids, enabling us to test the hypothesis that damage from sap-feeding herbivores interferes with VOC communication by including <b>emitter</b> and <b>receiver</b> aphid abundances as covariates in our analyses. One week after mechanical leaf damage, we removed all the emitter plants from the field and conducted fortnightly surveys of leaf herbivory. We found evidence that receiver plants responded using population-specific “dialects” where only receivers from the same source population as the damaged emitters suffered less leaf damage upon exposure to the volatile signals. We also found that the abundance of aphids on both <b>emitter</b> and <b>receiver</b> plants did not alter this volatile signalling during both production and reception despite well-documented defence crosstalk within individual plants that are simultaneously attacked by multiple herbivores. Overall, these results show that plant communication is highly sensitive to genetic relatedness between <b>emitter</b> and <b>receiver</b> plants and that communication is resilient to herbivore co-infestation.
