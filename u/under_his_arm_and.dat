500|$|Maulbetsch {{was said}} to run [...] "so low that he could dash under an {{ordinary}} table without losing his feet." [...] At a coaching conference in the 1920s, a coach doubted the table-ducking story and challenged Maulbetsch. [...] The doubter later recalled: [...] "I began ribbing him about this table-ducking stuff and finally offered to bet him he couldn’t do it. [...] Well, we got a table up in a room, Johnny tucked a water pitcher <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> backed against the wall. [...] Darned if he didn’t do it, the only thing, that water pitcher broke in a million pieces." [...] Asked about the incident, Maulbetsch said it was true, except one part. [...] Maulbetsch insisted there wasn’t a nick on the pitcher.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Singh starred as a Bengali {{criminal}} in Ali Abbas Zafar's Gunday, alongside Arjun Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Irrfan Khan. David Chute of Variety praised Singh's screen {{presence and}} {{wrote that he}} [...] "tucks the movie's center of interest <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> takes it with him — {{even though he has}} the could-be-thankless [...] "good brother" [...] role". Also, Singh's chemistry with Kapoor was considered by critic Rohit Khilnani to the prime asset of the film. Gunday proved to be Singh's biggest box office opener, and eventually emerged a box-office success with a revenue of [...] worldwide. After a cameo appearance in Finding Fanny, Singh starred as a gangster in Shaad Ali's unsuccessful crime drama Kill Dil opposite Parineeti Chopra and Ali Zafar and received negative reviews.|$|E
2500|$|Musical {{performances}} {{continued to}} be popular as well with such groups as the [...] "Chicago Marine Band", [...] "the Mexican Troubadours", the [...] "Boston Ladies Symphony Orchestra", and the very famous [...] "Sousa Band" [...] featuring John Philip Sousa, which performed twice in 1897 and in 1900. One musician, whose performance was inconvenienced by the failed shipment of his luggage and noisy child in the audience stormed off the stage. The Weekly Courier noted, [...] "He deliberately put his fiddle <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> left the stage like a crusty old curmudgeon." [...] 1898 even featured an open-air concert from the Tibbits balcony, {{which was part of}} the original Tibbits façade.|$|E

6000|$|For {{a moment}} Benson {{looked at him}} angrily, then his gaze softened. [...] "Not this time, George," [...] he said, quietly.

2500|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Michigan scored its second {{touchdown}} and converted the extra point to take a 12–5 lead. [...] Widman ran 65 yards for the touchdown on a [...] "delayed pass" [...] on the most exciting play of the game. [...] The Chicago Daily Tribune described Widman's run:"Widman scurried {{out of the back}} of the mass of players with the ball <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> down the field with nothing in sight ahead of him except the goal posts. [...] All the fast men of the Chicago team went in fast pursuit. [...] It was a beautiful race down the field. [...] Three Chicago men were close behind. [...] But the blue-legged runner gained almost imperceptibly at times, and then barely held his own. [...] He could run as fast as his pursuers, and with his start was safe. [...] If one or two of those Chicago players had made a dive for him perhaps he might have been stopped. One of them did try up near the goal, but missed him, tripping him slightly, but he rolled over the line. [...] Michigan had another touchdown and the game, and the Western championship in its pocket." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ACLU, {{representing}} {{plaintiffs in}} a voting rights case, asked the presiding federal judge to prevent Kobach from withholding the public documents he was photographed carrying as {{he met with}} Trump, by virtue of marking them [...] "confidential". The plaintiffs demanded the public release of those documents they have received, that had been prepared with state funds. They claimed Kobach [...] "made statements to the public, the Court, and the President, suggesting that noncitizen registration fraud is a serious, widespread problem", {{at the same time}} he tried to hide those same documents that debunked his claim, to prevent having to testify himself in open court about those same materials. In June 2017, the federal magistrate judge, James O'Hara, found that Kobach had made [...] "patently misleading representations" [...] to the court when he claimed he didn't possess the materials sought by the plaintiffs, in the course of the document dispute. Kobach had been photographed with the president with the documents <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> much of the cover page was readable in that photograph. In light of Kobach's [...] "deceptive conduct and lack of candor", he was fined $1,000 by the court and ordered to submit to questioning by the ACLU about the documents.|$|E
2500|$|Nabokov {{continues}} {{to express his}} scorn for the Soviet, indicating how he is a figure easily manipulated by others; the inability of a character to express his free will is a considerable crime for Nabokov. So {{not only does the}} reader observe that the Soviet's every emotion at the whim of Ivanov ("when he pressed the flat surface of the razor to the man's neck, his entire body twitched") but in the final paragraph, Ivanov seems to be able to control his foe physically. Petrified by the possibility of revenge being meted out, the Soviet cannot move until Ivanov commands it of him. Having done that the Russian barber [...] "clapped the bowler on his head, thrust the briefcase <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> swivelled him toward the door." [...] On leaving the barber's, descriptions of the Soviet further emphasise his robotic demeanour. Eyes completely shut, [...] "he stepped like an automaton", [...] "with the same mechanical gait" [...] and [...] "with an outstretched petrified hand". Each of these descriptions demonstrate the Soviet as being a non-individual, without free will, who can be manipulated and controlled by others. The political subtext of Nabokov's characterisation [...] communists simply follow the herd rather than think for themselves [...] becomes clearer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I like {{football}} best, it's so lively.

Oh, oh, it's exciting!" ...|$|R

2500|$|Everyone {{was eager}} to present a legal {{justification}} for the capture. [...] The British consul in Boston remarked that every other citizen was [...] "walking around with a Law Book <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> proving {{the right of the}} S. Jacintho [...] to stop H.M.'s mail boat." [...] Many newspapers likewise argued for the legality of Wilkes' actions, and numerous lawyers stepped forward to add their approval. Harvard law professor Theophilus Parsons wrote, [...] "I am just as certain that Wilkes had a legal right to take Mason and Slidell from the Trent, as I am that our government has a legal right to blockade the port of Charleston." [...] Caleb Cushing, a prominent Democrat, and former Attorney General (under Franklin Pierce) concurred: [...] "In my judgment, the act of Captain Wilkes was one which any and every self-respecting nation must and would have done by its own sovereign right and power, regardless of circumstances." [...] Richard Henry Dana, Jr., considered an expert on maritime law, justified the detention because the envoys were engaged [...] "solely [...] a mission hostile to the United States," [...] making them guilty of [...] "treason within our municipal law." [...] Edward Everett, a former minister to Great Britain and a former Secretary of State, also argued that [...] "the detention was perfectly lawful [...] their confinement in Fort Warren will be perfectly lawful." ...|$|E

He and Randy caught the fellow <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and,</b> standing him upright, dragged him to the window upon which {{the end of the}} plank rested. They shoved him out, and he went rolling and sliding down the plank into the snow. Randy followed him quickly, and then came Jack.|$|R

It had been commissioned by Cleveland from Daniel Chester French, and showed his brother in sports clothing with books <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> academic gown over his shoulder. It became the target of student pranks and these became so bad that the authorities eventually had to remove the sculpture to storage.|$|R

5000|$|He {{also let}} his beard grow, which {{was against the}} {{contemporary}} fashion.
