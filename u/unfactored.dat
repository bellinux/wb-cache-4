5000|$|The {{total number}} of prime factors Ω(n) for a semiprime n is two, by definition. A semiprime is either a square of a prime or square-free. The square of any prime number is a semiprime, so the largest known semiprime {{will always be the}} square of the largest known prime, unless the factors of the semiprime are not known. It is conceivable, but unlikely, that a way could be found to prove a larger number is a semiprime without knowing the two factors. A {{composite}} [...] non-divisible by primes [...] is semiprime. Various methods, such as elliptic pseudo-curves and the Goldwasser-Kilian ECPP theorem have been used to create provable, <b>unfactored</b> semiprimes with hundreds of digits.

Implicit-coupled and -decoupled strategies are compared for their efficiency in {{the solution of the}} Navier–Stokes equations in conjunction with low-Re two-equation turbulence models. Computations have been carried out for the flow over an axisymmetric bump using the k–ϵ and k–ω models. Comparisons have been obtained with experimental data and other numerical solutions.

40|$|PCFGs {{can grow}} {{exponentially}} as additional annotations {{are added to}} an initially simple base grammar. We present an approach where multiple annotations coexist, but in a factored manner that avoids this combinatorial explosion. Our method works with linguisticallymotivated annotations, induced latent structure, lexicalization, or any mix of the three. We use a structured expectation propagation algorithm that makes use of the factored structure in two ways. First, by partitioning the factors, it speeds up parsing exponentially over the <b>unfactored</b> approach. Second, it minimizes the redundancy of the factors during training, improving accuracy over an independent approach. Using purely latent variable annotations, we can efficiently train and parse with up to 8 latent bits per symbol, achieving F 1 scores up to 88. 4 on the Penn Treebank while using two orders of magnitudes fewer parameters compared to the naïve approach. Combining latent, lexicalized, and unlexicalized annotations, our best parser gets 89. 4 F 1 on all sentences from section 23 of the Penn Treebank. ...|$|E

40|$|Rarefaction is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in Eikonal equations, which is known to degrade the rate of convergence of numerical methods. The "factoring" approach alleviates this difficulty by deriving a PDE for a new (locally smooth) variable while capturing the rarefaction-related singularity in a known (non-smooth) "factor". Previously this technique was successfully used to address rarefaction fans arising at point sources. In this paper we show how similar ideas {{can be used to}} factor the 2 D rarefactions arising due to nonsmoothness of domain boundaries or discontinuities in PDE coefficients. Locations and orientations of such rarefaction fans are not known in advance and we construct a "just-in-time factoring" method that identifies them dynamically. The resulting algorithm is a generalization of the Fast Marching Method originally introduced for the regular (<b>unfactored)</b> Eikonal equations.

The flow around an oscillating aerofoil is computed as a test problem and calculations are presented both for laminar and turbulent flows. Initially, laminar flow calculations over an oscillating NACA 0012 aerofoil at various Mach numbers were carried out in order to assess the accuracy of the method in the prediction of the dynamic-stall vortex under laminar flow conditions. Furthermore, calculations were performed for quasi-steady and fully unsteady turbulent flows over the NACA 0015 aerofoil using various turbulence models at different flow conditions corresponding to attached unsteady flow as well as light- and deep-stall cases.

40|$|High-order methods {{gain more}} and more {{attention}} in computational fluid dynamics. However, the potential advantage of these methods depends critically {{on the availability of}} efficient elliptic solvers. With spectral-element methods, static condensation is a common approach {{to reduce the number of}} degree of freedoms and to improve the condition of the algebraic equations. The resulting system is block-structured and the face-based operator well suited for matrix-matrix multiplications. However, a straight-forward implementation scales super-linearly with the number of unknowns and, therefore, prohibits the application to high polynomial degrees. This paper proposes a novel factorization technique, which yields a linear operation count of just 13 N multiplications, where N is the total number of unknowns. In comparison to previous work it saves a factor larger than 3 and clearly outpaces <b>unfactored</b> variants for all polynomial degrees.
