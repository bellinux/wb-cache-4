To do this, we investigated fiber effects, matrix effects, and fiber/matrix interface effects. Using each of nine fiber types, we prepared embedded single-fiber specimens, single-ply specimens, and full laminates. From the single-fiber specimens, {{in addition to the}} standard fragmentation test analysis, we were able to use the low crack density data to provide information about the distribution of fiber flaws. The single-ply specimens provided evidence of a correlation between the size of kink band zones {{and the quality of the}} interface. Results of the laminate compression experiments mostly agreed with the results from single-ply experiments, although the <b>ultimate</b> <b>compression</b> <b>strengths</b> of laminates were higher. Generally, these experiments showed a strong effect of interfacial properties. Matrix effects were examined using laminates subjected to precracking under mixed-mode loading conditions. A large effect of precracking conditions on the mode 1 toughness of the laminates was found. In order to control the properties of the fiber/matrix interface, we prepared composites of carbon fiber and polycarbonate and subjected these to annealing.

The low {{deforming}} {{force of}} Lead (Pb) and {{the proximity of}} its stress-strain response make it readily preferred as test material for laboratory modelling of complex hot steel rolling. Structural steel recrystallises from a temperature of approximately 500 °C. For Pb, this process starts within the range of- 3 °C to 0 °C. The room temperature rolling of Pb delivers reasonable information of hot rolling of steel.

Significant improvement in Mode I and II interlaminar toughness have been observed previously. In this work, several substructural in-plane strength tests relevant to aerostructures were undertaken: bolt/tension-bearing, open hole compression, and L-shape laminate bending. Improvements are observed for the nanostitched samples: critical bearing strength by 30 %, open-hole <b>compression</b> <b>ultimate</b> <b>strength</b> by 10 %, and L-shape laminate energy (via increased deflection) of 40 %. The mechanism of reinforcement is not compliant interlayer creation, but rather is a fiberstitching mechanism, as no increase in interlayer thickness occurs with the nanostitches. Unlike traditional (large-fiber/tow/pin) stitching or z-pinning techniques that damage inplane fibers and reduce laminate in-plane strengths, the nano-scale CNT-based ‘stitches’ improve in-plane strength, demonstrating the potential of such an architecture for aerospace structural applications.

Standardized specimens that consisted of one of the 4 brands of bone cement and one of the 3 brands of vancomycin were fashioned, producing 12 combinations of ALBC. Two dosages of vancomycin in 40 g bone cement were used to represent the high (4 g vancomycin) and low (1 g vancomycin) dose groups. Concentrations of vancomycin elution from ALBC was measured for up to 336 hours.

40|$|The {{bond stress}} between steel and {{concrete}} {{is the essential}} condition to the good behaviour of reinforced concrete structures. To preview the use of concrete with waste incorporation for structural aims, the verification of its quality control is necessary, whether of <b>compression</b> <b>strength</b> and bond. This paper presents the study results about the viability use of APULOT tests, that is a bond tests, to prevent the <b>compression</b> <b>strength</b> of concrete with rubber addition. The purpose of APULOT tests become study in many laboratories in France and Brazil, where is to estimate the <b>compression</b> <b>strength</b> using the bond stress obtained in tests execute inside of building construction. Also the use of concrete with rubber addition to structural use has been made with safe because this kind of addition makes the concrete <b>compression</b> <b>strength</b> decrease. To study its <b>compression</b> <b>strength</b> behavior is also make part of this research. This work aims to contribute with standardization of APULOT tests, and also give conditions to use the concrete with rubber addition in structural elements with more safe...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of direct flexographic printing on the <b>compression</b> <b>strength</b> of the RSC style containers when high quality graphics were printed, using thick and thin plate technology. Three factors were studied including: 1) different plate technology (thick and thin), 2) number of colors being printed (one and three), 3) printing impression (light and heavy). The <b>compression</b> <b>strength</b> comparison of the preprint and the postprint were also examined. The results showed that using the thick plate technology caused a significant reduction in the <b>compression</b> <b>strength</b> of printed containers, compared to either preprint containers or containers printed by using the thin plate technology. With the thick plate technology, printing more colors on corrugated containers resulted in a significant reduction of the containers 2 ̆ 7 <b>compression</b> <b>strength.</b> Because of the compressible backing material used in the thin plate technology, the strength of printed containers was highly maintained. This allowed box manufacturers to print more colors on containers without significantly decreasing their <b>compression</b> <b>strength,</b> even when printed with a large surface area and on all four panels...|$|R
