5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> spatial soliton can exist, {{we have to}} make some {{considerations}} about a simple convex lens. As shown in the picture on the right, an optical field approaches the lens and then it is focused. The effect of the lens is to introduce a non-uniform phase change that causes focusing. This phase change {{is a function of the}} space and can be represented with , whose shape is approximately represented in the picture.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Eric Lenneberg criticised Whorf's {{examples}} from an objectivist view of language holding that languages are principally meant to represent {{events in the}} real world and that even though languages express these ideas in various ways, the meanings of such expressions and therefore the thoughts of the speaker are equivalent. He argued that Whorf's English descriptions of a Hopi speaker's view of time were in fact translations of the Hopi concept into English, therefore disproving linguistic relativity. However Whorf was concerned with how the habitual use of language influences habitual behavior, rather than translatability. Whorf's point was that while English speakers may be able to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> Hopi speaker thinks, they do not think in that way.|$|E

25|$|As the ovules {{develop into}} seeds, the ovary begins to ripen and the ovary wall, the pericarp, may become fleshy (as in berries or drupes), or form a hard outer {{covering}} (as in nuts). In some multiseeded fruits, {{the extent to}} which the flesh develops is proportional to the number of fertilized ovules. The pericarp is often differentiated into two or three distinct layers called the exocarp (outer layer, also called epicarp), mesocarp (middle layer), and endocarp (inner layer). In some fruits, especially simple fruits derived from an inferior ovary, other parts of the flower (such as the floral tube, including the petals, sepals, and stamens), fuse with the ovary and ripen with it. In other cases, the sepals, petals and/or stamens and style of the flower fall off. When such other floral parts are a significant part of the fruit, it is called an accessory fruit. Since other parts of the flower may contribute to the structure of the fruit, it is important to study flower structure to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> particular fruit forms.|$|E

500|$|This {{position}} was further buttressed in Re Findlay (1984), where four prisoners {{contended that the}} Home Secretary's new policy of refusing parole in all but exceptional cases was a fetter upon his discretion. The House of Lords rejected {{the argument that the}} relevant statutory provisions required [...] "individual consideration of individual cases in every instance, free of presumptions or policies", and held that {{it would be difficult to}} <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> Secretary of State could properly manage the complexities of his statutory duty without a policy.|$|E

500|$|By May 1846, {{troubled by}} the {{financial}} difficulties at Brook Farm, Ripley had made an informal split from the community. [...] By its closure a year later, Brook Farm had amassed a total debt of $17,445. Ripley was devastated at the failure of his experiment and told a friend, [...] "I can now <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> man would feel if he could attend his own funeral". His personal life was also taxed. His wife had converted to Catholicism in 1846, encouraged by Orestes Brownson, and had become doubtful of his Associationist politics; the Ripleys' relationship became strained by the 1850s.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{writer and}} critic Granville Hicks gave Player Piano a {{positive}} review, favorably {{comparing it to}} Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Hicks called Vonnegut a [...] "sharp-eyed satirist". None of the reviewers considered the novel particularly important. Several editions were printed—one by Bantam with the title Utopia 14, and another by the Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club—whereby Vonnegut gained the repute of a science fiction writer, a genre held in disdain by writers at that time. He defended the genre, and deplored a perceived sentiment that [...] "no one can simultaneously be a respectable writer and <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> refrigerator works." ...|$|E
500|$|George Ripley, who {{had begun}} the experiment, made an {{unofficial}} break with Brook Farm in May 1846. Many others began to leave as well, though {{the dissolution of the}} farm was slow. As one Brook Farmer said, the slow decline of the community was like apple petals drifting slowly to the ground, making it seem [...] "dreamy and unreal". On November 5, 1846, Ripley's book collection, which had served as Brook Farm's library, was auctioned to help cover the association's debts. By the end, Brook Farm had a total debt of $17,445. Ripley told a friend, [...] "I can now <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> man would feel if he could attend his own funeral". He took a job with the New York Tribune and it took him 13 years to pay off the Brook Farm debt, which he did in 1862.|$|E

A contemporaneous Italian writer wrote: [...] "Nobody after Mayer has <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> composer {{can take advantage of}} a sensible usage of the chorus.

Francesco Regli in its Dizionario biografico stated: [...] "With Clotilde Coccia taught <b>how</b> <b>a</b> chorus has to be written".|$|R
500|$|Another {{important}} practitioner in {{the field}} of psychodrama is Carl Hollander. Hollander was the 37th director certified by Moreno in psychodrama. He is known primarily for his creation of the Hollander Psychodrama Curve, which may be utilized as a way to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> psychodrama session is structured. Hollander uses the image of a curve to explain the three parts of a psychodrama session: the warm-up, the activity, and the integration. [...] The warm-up exists to put patients into a place of spontaneity and creativity in order to be open in the act of psychodrama. The [...] "activity" [...] is the actual enactment of the psychodrama process. Finally, the [...] "curve" [...] moves to integration. It serves as closure and discussion of the session, and considers how the session can be brought into real life – a sort of debriefing.|$|E
500|$|It {{became one}} of the best-selling {{independent}} rock albums within a year, selling 634,000 copies by June. As a result of this success, the group signed to Warner Bros. in the same month. The album was certified gold the following month by the RIAA. Taking Back Sunday was the first Victory Records band with a gold album; although the label did not intend to certify the album, it was certified by the group's label at the time, Warner Bros. According to Victory Records founder Tony Brummel, [...] "From where I sit, this is another attempt by the RIAA and its major-label partners to victimize, abuse and belittle an independent record company." [...] Band manager Jillian Newman responded, [...] "I don't <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> label gets victimized by receiving a sales award." [...] By September, 667,000 copies had been sold; in early 2006 album sales stood at 700,000 copies, and by July its sales were over 720,000.|$|E
500|$|The German V-1 {{flying bomb}} {{demonstrated}} a serious omission in OSRD's portfolio: guided missiles. While the OSRD {{had some success}} developing unguided rockets, it had nothing comparable to the V-1, the V-2 or the Henschel Hs 293 air-to-ship gliding guided bomb. Although the United States trailed the Germans and Japanese in several areas, this represented an entire field {{that had been left}} to the enemy. Bush did not seek the advice of Dr. Robert H. Goddard. Goddard would come to be regarded as America's pioneer of rocketry, but many contemporaries regarded him as a crank. Before the war, Bush had gone on the record as saying, [...] "I don't <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> serious scientist or engineer can play around with rockets", but in May 1944, he was forced to travel to London to warn General Dwight Eisenhower of the danger posed by the V-1 and V-2. Bush could only recommend that the launch sites be bombed, which was done.|$|E

500|$|The {{theoretical}} physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg considered {{whether the}} neutron {{could be a}} fundamental nuclear particle like the proton and electron, rather than a proton–electron pair. [...] Heisenberg showed that the neutron was best described as a new nuclear particle, but its exact nature remained unclear. [...] In his 1933 Bakerian Lecture, Chadwick estimated that a neutron had a mass of about [...] Since a proton and an electron had a combined mass of , this implied the neutron as a proton–electron composite had a binding energy of about , which sounded reasonable, although {{it was hard to}} <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> particle with so little binding energy could be stable. [...] Estimating such a small mass difference required challenging precise measurements, however, and several conflicting results were obtained in 1933–4. [...] By bombarding boron with alpha particles, Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie obtained a large value for the mass of a neutron, but Ernest Lawrence's team at the University of California produced a small one. [...] Then Maurice Goldhaber, a refugee from Nazi Germany and {{a graduate student at the}} Cavendish Laboratory, suggested to Chadwick that deuterons could be photodisintegrated by the 2.6 MeV gamma rays of 208Tl (then known as thorium C"): ...|$|E
