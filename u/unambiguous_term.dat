5000|$|The {{ambiguity}} {{about the}} scope of the name [...] "Bryozoa" [...] led to proposals in the 1960s and 1970s that it should be avoided and the <b>unambiguous</b> <b>term</b> [...] "Ectoprocta" [...] should be used. However, the change would have made it harder to find older works about in which the phylum was called [...] "Bryozoa", and the desire to avoid ambiguity, if applied consistently to all classifications, would have necessitated renaming of several other phyla and many lower-level groups. In practice, zoological naming of split or merged groups of animals is complex and not completely consistent. Works since 2000 have used various names to resolve the ambiguity, including: [...] "Bryozoa", [...] "Ectoprocta", [...] "Bryozoa (Ectoprocta)", and [...] "Ectoprocta (Bryozoa)". Some have used more than one approach in the same work.|$|E
50|$|Popular culture {{uses the}} word jealousy as a synonym for envy. Many {{dictionary}} definitions include a reference to envy or envious feelings. In fact, the overlapping use of jealousy and envy has a long history.The terms are used indiscriminately in such popular 'feelgood' books as Nancy Friday's Jealousy, where the expression 'jealousy' applies to {{a broad range of}} passions, from envy to lust and greed. While this kind of usage blurs the boundaries between categories that are intellectually valuable and psychologically justifiable, such confusion is understandable in that historical explorations of the term indicate that these boundaries have long posed problems. Margot Grzywacz's fascinating etymological survey of the word in Romance and Germanic languages asserts, indeed, that the concept was one of those that proved to be the most difficult to express in language and was therefore among the last to find an <b>unambiguous</b> <b>term.</b> Classical Latin used invidia, without strictly differentiating between envy and jealousy. It was not until the postclassical era that Latin borrowed the late and poetic Greek word zelotypia and the associated adjective zelosus. It is from this adjective that are derived French jaloux, Provençal gelos, Italian geloso, and Spanish celoso. (Lloyd, 1995, page 4)Perhaps the overlapping use of jealousy and envy occurs because people can experience both at the same time. A person may envy the characteristics or possessions of someone who also happens to be a romantic rival. In fact, one may even interpret romantic jealousy as a form of envy. A jealous person may envy the affection that his or her partner gives to a rival — affection the jealous person feels entitled to himself or herself. People often use the word jealousy as a broad label that applies to both experiences of jealousy and experiences of envy.|$|E

It is argued that the lineage population concept avoids the ambiguities associated with related biological and anthropological concepts and polysemes such as population, ethnicity, and race. Other terms and concepts, such as form, cline, cluster, geographic population, breeding population, genetic population, breed, species, subspecies, ancestry, geographic ancestry, biogeographic ancestry, ancestral population, ancestry population, natural division, and population lineage, are discussed in relation to this concept.

40|$|Summary: This report {{examines}} {{the meaning of}} validity and reliability {{and the role of}} psychometrics in plastic surgery. Study titles increasingly include the word “valid” to support the authors’ claims. Studies by other investigators may be labeled “not validated. ” Validity simply refers to the ability of a device to measure what it intends to measure. Validity is not an intrinsic test property. It is a relative term most credibly assigned by the independent user. Similarly, the word “reliable” is subject to interpretation. In psychometrics, its meaning is synonymous with “reproducible. ” The definitions of valid and reliable are analogous to accuracy and precision. Reliability (both the reliability of the data and the consistency of measurements) is a prerequisite for validity. Outcome measures in plastic surgery are intended to be surveys, not tests. The role of psychometric modeling in plastic surgery is unclear, and this discipline introduces difficult jargon that can discourage investigators. Standard statistical tests suffice. The <b>unambiguous</b> <b>term</b> “reproducible” is preferred when discussing data consistency. Study design and methodology are essential considerations when assessing a study’s validity...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the food supply chain, an {{increase}} of the integration's degree in the chain may be an important aspect in the context of increasing the efficiency of agri-food companies. Therefore, exploring the relationships among these variables was found as an important research area and adopted as the goal of the paper. The paper is focused mainly on the theoretical background showing the relationship between integration and performance. A description of the theoretical and methodological aspects of performance measurement and its extension (including the integration aspect) was also made within the framework of the paper. For an empirical illustration of the analyzed relationships two steps were made. Firstly, the integration's degree in the food chain was measured. Secondly, the efficiency of the companies from the cereals processing industry in Europe was assessed. The SFA models (e. g. Translog and Cobb-Douglas functional form) were used for assessment of efficiency. By using stochastic method (e. g. the SFA, Stochastic Frontier Analysis), one may show the influence of external variable (the integration in the supply chain) on the efficiency performance of enterprises. Efficiency of economic entities is not an <b>unambiguous</b> <b>term.</b> There are several different concepts of efficiency, its measurement and expressions. Within the framework of efficiency, many terms of similar meaning may be applied. However, these concepts are not identical. The actual concept of efficiency is derived from the structure of the production function, therefore it is conditioned by changes in the productivity of production factors and their remuneration and refers to the allocation of production factors in the most technically efficient way...|$|E

40|$|The {{terminology}} {{relating to}} 'psychological stress' is so confused and ambiguous that {{research in this}} field - and application of its results - must surely be hampered. Relevant words with conflicting usages and scientific definitions include 'stress' itself, 'stressor', 'strain', 'challenge', 'demand', 'threat', 'resource', 'coping' and 'mental load'. 'Stress' and 'anxiety' are often confounded. Because of this confusion {{it can be hard to}} decide how closely one view of stress matches another and to integrate the variety of published conceptual frameworks. The word 'stress' is therefore useful only as a deliberately vague umbrella term. Nevertheless there is moderate consensus in the literature that the mental state characterizing 'stress' (which, to avoid ambiguity, we call 'psystress') results from awareness that one is not coping with something, a perceived stressor, that relates to a need that is deemed personally important. Other definitions and models of 'stress' are compared. 'Stress' is often applied to situations that actually cause pleasurable excitement. We propose the <b>unambiguous</b> <b>term</b> 'euchallenge' for such enjoyable demands, because 'eustress' and 'challenge' also have other meanings. Supposedly adverse stress responses are sometimes studied using tasks or situations, which are assumed to be stressors, but which for some individuals might be euchallenges or in others produce apathy through perceived irrelevance to personal needs. Much research utilizes self-report stress questionnaires and many of these are composed with poor regard to theory. Some, for example, mix psystress causation with a variety of response factors or pay inadequate attention to 'chronic' and 'acute' time scales. Testees may even be required to interpret words on which psychologists themselves disagree - notably 'stress' itself. It is important, therefore, to evaluate carefully every test in the context of its purpose, but, most importantly for scientific advance, to relate it to a comprehensive testable theoretical model...|$|E
40|$|Spiritual solicitude, or a {{few words}} on Conscience. The concept of {{conscience}} is not an <b>unambiguous</b> <b>term</b> and is not infrequently exposed to the danger of reducing its characteristic depth. This danger appears especially where it is understood above all, or, in extreme cases, merely as man’s ability or his specific power involving pronouncing judgements on particular deeds or attitudes, in terms of moral good or evil, passing over, and sometimes even forgetting about what makes it capable, {{as well as the}} space in which this distinctive process takes place, thus constitutively belonging to the nature of this specific human reality. An opposed view of understanding of conscience as a judgement, the existentially experienced conscience perceived as distinctive spiritual space marked with the sense of humanness appears – with a privileged place for meetings and growth. Meetings with oneself, with another man and with God, as well as growing in freedom and love, towards complete humanness. What best characterises it is the experience and understanding that authentic self-fulfilment as a person – open with the Absolute, {{as well as with the}} whole reality – means our welfare and obligates. The emerging responsibility for oneself calls on to search for forms and ways, not just any, but harmonious with the discovered sense of one’s own existence, in order to accomplish this moral good. Whereas, the gradually emerging horizon of sense, constitutively contributing to man’s moral awareness, not only lightens self-understanding, but also makes us capable of appropriate grasping of the deepest essence of good or evil of our particular decisions. In this way, conscience becomes „the light”, „the guide” and „the judge” of our being, our self-fulfilment in freedom. Many a thing indicate that moral awareness and ability to pronounce specific judgements, though diverse in terms of proprium typical of each of them, indeed constitute one, dynamic and indivisible entity. Breaking it inevitably leads to limiting, and sometimes even distortion of one’s own humanness...|$|E
40|$|The {{transnational}} {{activities of}} migrant groups {{have become a}} major issue in recent decades. This study offers an analysis of overseas Sikhs' involvement in Punjab issues; especially concentrating on post- 1984 period, when a vigorous support and mobilisation by overseas Sikhs for a 'homeland' has led to diplomatic strains between the Government of India and some of the states with large Sikh migrant population. This study concentrates upon the mobilisation among Sikh migrant groups in Canada, the United States and Great Britain -three countries which account for over three quarter of overseas Sikh population. The issue of 'homeland' among displaced minorities and migrant groups has usually been studied as a diasporic phenomenon. In a theoretical formulation preceding this study, the term diaspora and recent contributions to extend its scope to all such migrant groups who were neither forced out of their homelands nor had continuous historic connections is critically examined. Rejecting the wider definition advocated by more recent contributors to extend this term to any migrant group which maintains some connections with their land of origins, a case is made for only those migrant groups which are essentially involved in a demand for a secure and independent 'homeland' to be part of 'diaspora studies' Proceeding with migration history and experiences of Sikhs in Britain, Canada and the United States, the study explores the persistence and continuation of cultural and religious practices derived from their land of origins. Noting that neither the homeland for Sikhs was an <b>unambiguous</b> <b>term</b> till recently nor were they forced out from their homes, Sikh migrant groups provide an interesting but problematic example of transnational ethnic linkages. The next two chapters analyze the social, cultural and political links with the Punjab. The study then provides a description and analysis of Sikh mobilisation as a reaction to dramatic events in the Punjab in June 1984. The last chapter situates overseas Sikh mobilisation as a reaction to a crisis which has fermented some new elements of ethnic consciousness with consequent bearing upon the group identity and political mobilisation within overseas Sikh migrant groups. It also notes the impact of overseas Sikh mobilisation on the transnational relationship of concerned states and their respective policies towards Sikh migrant groups. This study of overseas Sikhs provides an interesting case of transnational politics where a crucial event in a migrant groups' home country could perceptibly shift their political loyalty towards an imaginary homeland, and how in the process, their land of origin becomes a 'threatened homeland'. The study thus illustrates the limitation of the existing analytical concepts dealing with the behaviour of migrant groups whose attachments to their roots are principally triggered into a virulent form of mobilisation due to a traumatic event in their religious centre. The study draws upon a wide range of sources including interviews with leading participants, and a thorough examination of ethnic Purijabi media of the United States, Canada and Great Britain. In addition it takes account of the growing body of secondary materials associated with the study of Sikhs in the Punjab...|$|E
