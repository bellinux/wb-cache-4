50|$|II. Relativism. In addition, Krausz’s work on relativism canvasses {{the range}} and {{significance}} of relativistic doctrines and rehearses their virtues and vices. He considers relativism as the claim that truth, goodness, or beauty (among other values) is relative to some reference frame, and no absolute standards to adjudicate between reference frames exist. He defines and differentiates various strands of absolutism: realism, universalism and foundationalism. Krausz argues that when these strands of absolutism are <b>unwoven,</b> and when relativism is understood as the negation of these strands, classical self-refutation arguments against relativism do not apply. In turn, Krausz considers whether the idea of “undifferentiated ” survives the relativist challenge. He suggests that the assertion of undifferentiated unity, instanced for example in some Asian soteriologies, is compatible with relativism as here he defines it.|$|E

[...] The fact that the statue was filled with oil and the feet were bound with wool may relate back to the myth of [...] "The Castration of Uranus". In this myth Rhea gives Cronus a rock to eat in Zeus' stead thus tricking Cronus. Although mastership of knots is a feature of Greek origin it is also typical of the Varunian {{sovereign}} figure, as apparent e.g. in Odin. Once Zeus was victorious over Cronus, he sets this stone up at Delphi and constantly it is anointed with oil and strands of <b>unwoven</b> wool are placed on it. [...] It wore a red cloak, and was brought out of the temple {{to take part in}} ritual processions and lectisternia, banquets at which images of the gods were arranged as guests on couches.

40|$|International audienceSince {{software}} systems {{need to be}} continuously available, {{their ability}} to evolve at runtime is a key issue. The emergence of models@runtime, combined with Aspect-Oriented Modeling techniques, is a promising approach to tame the complexity of adaptive systems. However, with no support for aspect unweaving, these approaches are not agile enough in an adaptive system context. In case of small modifications, the adapted model has to be generated by again weaving all the aspects, even those unchanged. This paper shows how aspects can be <b>unwoven,</b> based on a precise traceability metamodel dedicated to aspect model weaving. We analyze traceability models, which describe how aspects were woven into a base, {{to determine the extent}} to which an aspect has affected the woven model in order to determine how it can be <b>unwoven.</b> Aspect unweaving is finally performed by applying inverse operations of a sub-sequence of the weaving operations in opposite order...|$|E

40|$|Code {{modularization}} provides benefits {{throughout the}} software life cycle; however, {{the presence of}} crosscutting concerns (CCCs) in software hinders its complete modularization. Traditional modularization techniques work well {{under the assumption that}} code being modularized is functionally orthogonal {{to the rest of the}} code; as a result, software engineers try to separate code segments that are orthogonal in their functionality into distinct modules. However, in practice, software does not decompose neatly into modules with distinct, orthogonal functionality. In this thesis, we investigate the modularization of CCCs in software using two different techniques. Firstly, we discuss IVCon, a GUI-based tool that provides a novel approach to the modularization of CCCs. We have designed IVCon to capture the multi-concern nature of code. IVCon enables users to create, examine, and modify their code in two different views, the woven view and the <b>unwoven</b> view. The woven view displays program code in colors that indicate which CCCs various code segments implement, while the <b>unwoven</b> view displays code in two panels, one showing the core of the program and the other showing all the code implementing each concern in an isolated module. IVCon aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for conveniently creating, examining, and modifying code in, and translating between, the woven and <b>unwoven</b> views. Secondly, we discuss LoPSiL, which is a location-based policy-specification language. LoPSiL is Turing-complete and provides users with language constructs that enable them to manipulate location information; hence, LoPSiL can be used to specify and enforce generic policies that might involve location-based constraints. We have implemented a LoPSiL compiler using AspectJ, and we observe and discuss how the use of traditional units of modularization [...] -aspects in this case [...] -help modularize functionally orthogonal CCCs such as security and auditing...|$|E

Our goal is to offer: (1) tool compatibility letting programmers develop, integrate, modify, and debug C 4 -based extensions that preserve their existing development workflow and leverages their existing tools rather than requiring additional tools; (2) code understandability of the C 4 syntax such that is it straightforward for an uninitiated C programmer to use immediately; and, (3) runtime performance achieving near-zero overhead such that it can be used even in performance critical execution paths. As such C 4 source code can be viewed as the result of weaving in AOSD style introductions and advices inline into C program.

In this study, experimental investigations were carried out in order to provide a better understanding on the effectiveness of TRM versus FRP jackets as a means of increasing: (i) the axial capacity of concrete through confinement; and (ii) the load-carrying capacity of shear-critical reinforced concrete flexural members. From the results obtained it is strongly believed that the proposed TRM strengthening technique is a viable alternative to the already successful FRP strengthening technique...|$|E
