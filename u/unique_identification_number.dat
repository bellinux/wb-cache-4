25|$|All {{officers}} have a <b>unique</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number.</b> These are usually {{referred to as}} shoulder or collar numbers, referring {{to the fact that}} they were once worn on the uniform collar and later on the epaulettes by constables and sergeants. Uniformed officers in many forces still wear them on the epaulettes, but other forces have badges or other ways of displaying their identification numbers. Kent Police, for instance, refers to its numbers as force numbers and officers wear them on a velcro tab on their stab vest or on a badge attached to their shirt or tunic. Officers in all forces of the rank of inspector or above do not usually wear their numbers.|$|E
500|$|Not surprisingly, N. rajah is a {{relatively}} well known plant in Malaysia, especially its native Sabah. The species {{is often used to}} promote Sabah, and specifically Kinabalu National Park, as a tourist destination, and features prominently on postcards from the region. Nepenthes rajah has appeared on the covers of several popular Nepenthes publications, including Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu (Kurata, 1976) and Nepenthes of Borneo (Clarke, 1997), both published in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia. On April 6, 1996, Malaysia issued a series of four postage stamps depicting some of its more famous Nepenthes species. [...] Two 30¢ stamps, featuring N. macfarlanei and N. sanguinea, as well as two 50¢ stamps, [...] depicting N. lowii and N. rajah, were released. The N. rajah stamp has been assigned a <b>unique</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> in two popular stamp numbering systems: Scott #580 and Yvert #600. Curiously, the peltate leaf attachment that is so characteristic of this species is not shown. Nepenthes rajah was featured in the first episode of Kingdom of Plants 3D, a natural history documentary series presented by David Attenborough.|$|E

2500|$|In {{computers}} and telecommunication systems, writing systems {{are generally not}} codified as such, but graphemes and other grapheme-like units that are required for text processing are represented by [...] "characters" [...] that typically manifest in encoded form. There are many , such as ISO/IEC 8859-1 (a character repertoire and encoding scheme oriented toward the Latin script), CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) and bi-directional text. Today, many such standards are re-defined in a collective standard, the ISO/IEC 10646 [...] "Universal Character Set", and a parallel, closely related expanded work, The Unicode Standard. Both are generally encompassed by the term Unicode. In Unicode, each character, in every language's writing system, is (simplifying slightly) given a <b>unique</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number,</b> known as its code point. Computer operating systems use code points to look up characters in the font file, so the characters can be displayed on the page or screen.|$|E
