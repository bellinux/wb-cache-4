5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the New Hampshire hills, {{but it will not}} succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E
500|$|Three {{months into}} his loan spell, in early October, Rehman {{said of his}} move to play for Blackpool: [...] "I'm quite glad {{to get away from}} all the hustle and bustle of London. I really like it <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Blackpool; it's a good club with an ambitious young manager. Hopefully, {{over the next few months}} I can {{convince}} Simon Grayson I'm worthy of a long-term contract." [...] On 31 December he returned to QPR after having made three league appearances, all of which were as a substitute.|$|E

Joe Kernan, whose Armagh team triumphed over Ó Sé's Kerry team in the 2002 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, said: “The reaction to his death <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Ulster has been incredible. Every GAA man, woman and child {{in any part of}} the country felt they knew Páidí. He {{was just one of those}} great characters that people loved. It's hard to believe he's gone.” Colm Cooper, who first played for Kerry when Ó Sé was manager, was said to be devastated.|$|E

He has fought for mandatory safety sprinklers in college dormitories and training of fire departments to deal with terrorism incidents involving chemical and biological weapons.
