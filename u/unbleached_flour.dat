5000|$|<b>Unbleached</b> <b>flour</b> {{is simply}} flour {{that has not}} {{undergone}} bleaching and therefore {{does not have the}} color of [...] "white" [...] flour. An example is Graham flour, whose namesake, Sylvester Graham, was against using bleaching agents, which he considered unhealthy.|$|E
5000|$|Wonder Bread began {{appearing}} on Canadian grocery shelves and home delivery routes {{as early as}} 1927. A product of Northern Bakeries Limited, the bread apparently made its debut in Montreal. [...] In 1928, the [...] "Wonder" [...] trademark was registered with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office by Northern Bakeries Limited. Two years later, Wonder arrived in Toronto, baked by Nasmiths Limited. Newspaper ads proclaimed [...] "Great news {{for the people of}} Toronto - it's here at last - the delicious Wonder Bread." [...] Made from <b>unbleached</b> <b>flour</b> and [...] "Slo-Baked," [...] Wonder was said to produce [...] "more slices and thinner slices" [...] when cut, yet would not crumble. [...] By 1934, [...] "Sliced Wonder," [...] an early version of sliced bread, was being promoted by the Ideal Bread Company Limited of Toronto, with no fewer [...] "than 26 slices in a loaf." ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Unbleached-flour, high-ratio white cakes were {{prepared}} with - 15, - 10, - 5, 0, + 5 percent variations in sugar/water level from American Association of Cereal Chemists Method 10 - 90. Formulas {{with and without}} added cream of tartar were used. Specific gravity, batter and crumb pH, volume, crumb and crust color and compressibility were objectively measured. Seven trained judges participated in sensory evaluation for cell uniformity, cell compactness, layering, grain, tenderness, moistness, softness, crumb color, flavor, half-cake shape and surface characteristics, evenness and degree of browning. Analysis of variance showed a significant difference at the 0. 05 level between bleached flour control and <b>unbleached</b> <b>flour</b> cakes for specific gravity, crumb pH, volume, crust hue characteristics, compressibility, cell compactness, layering, grain, softness, tenderness, moisture, crumb color, flavor, half-cake shape and surface, degree and evenness of crust browning. Cream of tartar in <b>unbleached</b> <b>flour</b> cakes caused {{a significant difference in}} crumb pH. Sugar/water level variation caused significant difference in crumb color and evenness of browning...|$|E
5000|$|Cake {{flour in}} {{particular}} is nearly always chlorinated. There {{is at least one}} flour labeled [...] "unbleached cake flour blend" [...] (marketed by King Arthur) that is not bleached, but the protein content is much higher than typical cake flour at about 9.4% protein (cake flour is usually around 6% to 8%). According to King Arthur, this flour is a blend of a more finely milled <b>unbleached</b> wheat <b>flour</b> and cornstarch, which makes a better end result than <b>unbleached</b> wheat <b>flour</b> alone (cornstarch blended with all-purpose flour commonly substituted for cake flour when the latter is unavailable). The end product, however, is denser than would result from lower-protein, chlorinated cake flour.|$|R
50|$|A {{substitute}} for {{it would be}} a mix of <b>unbleached</b> white <b>flour</b> and wheat middlings and this was commonly done prior to and after the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906, but the FDA gradually established standards and eliminated imitations from the market. It was reported in 1913 that bread made from graham flour had a protein content of 12.1%.|$|R
2500|$|Hard Red Winter– Hard, brownish, mellow high-protein wheat {{used for}} bread, hard baked goods {{and as an}} adjunct in other flours to {{increase}} protein in pastry flour for pie crusts. Some brands of <b>unbleached</b> all-purpose <b>flours</b> are commonly made from hard red winter wheat alone. It is primarily traded on the Kansas City Board of Trade. One variety is known as [...] "turkey red wheat", and was brought to Kansas by Mennonite immigrants from Russia.|$|R
5000|$|Bakers {{have devised}} several ways of {{encouraging}} a stable culture of micro-organisms in the starter. <b>Unbleached,</b> unbromated <b>flour</b> contains more micro-organisms than more processed flours. Bran-containing (wholemeal) flour provides the greatest variety of organisms and additional minerals, though some cultures use an initial mixture of white flour and rye or {{whole wheat flour}} or [...] "seed" [...] the culture using unwashed organic grapes (for the wild yeasts on their skins). Grapes and grape must are also sources of lactic acid bacteria, as are many other edible plants. Basil leaves are soaked in room-temperature water for an hour to seed traditional Greek sourdough. Using water from boiled potatoes is said to increase {{the activity of the}} bacteria by providing additional starch.|$|R
40|$|Whether or not {{wheat flour}} {{contains}} provitamin A in amounts {{which could be}} of any importance for general nutrition {{is a question of}} considerable interest. Since Wesener and Teller (1) as well as Monier-Williams (2) considered carotene, C 40 H 56, to be the chief fat-soluble pigment of flour, this claim has been more or less supported by numerous authors (3). It was, however, correctly pointed out in the short reviews given by Widmark and Neymark (4) and by Jörgensen (5) that the reported carotene content of flour decreased with increased progress in this field. While Ferrari and Bailey (6) considered “carotin” the chief component of the coloring matter, it is rightly stated in an important paper by Markley and Bailey (7) that {{only a fraction of the}} wheat carotenoids can consist of carotene; e. g., one-third to one-seventh of the total pigment. These figures are, however, still much too high. Malmberg and von Euler (8) were unable to detect any carotene at all in 100 gm. of wheat, and they found xanthophyll, C 40 H 56 O 2, to be the chief polyene, in accordance with the data of Bowden and Moore (9) who proved the presence of xanthophyll in wheat germ oil. According to our new chromatographic experiments, only a small part of the carefully saponified pigment shows an epiphasic behavior, and even this fraction can easily be separated from added β-carotene in the Tswett column. Consequently we claim that the analyzed, <b>unbleached</b> <b>flours</b> are practically or absolutely free of carotene, the carotene content being less than 0. 01 mg. per kilo in any case. Other samples are under investigation, but even our whole wheat flour does not contain much more carotene or xanthophyll than fine grade samples...|$|R
50|$|Tortilla: a flatbread made {{predominantly}} {{either of}} <b>unbleached</b> white wheat <b>flour</b> or of cornmeal. Blue corn tortillas are a quintessential New Mexico-style tortilla. New Mexico-style flour tortillas are typically thicker and less chewy than those found in, for instance, Texas or California. This {{results from the}} lower-protein, more cake-like flour commonly available in New Mexico. New Mexican expatriates who travel back to the state for visits will often bring an extra carry-on to fill with New Mexico tortillas and frozen green chile.|$|R
5000|$|Whole-wheat flour (in the US) or wholemeal flour (in the UK) is a powdery substance, a basic food ingredient, {{derived by}} {{grinding}} or mashing the whole grain of wheat, {{also known as}} the wheatberry. Whole-wheat flour is used in baking of breads and other baked goods, and also typically mixed with other lighter [...] "white" [...] <b>unbleached</b> or bleached <b>flours</b> (that have been treated with flour bleaching agent(s)) to restore nutrients to the white flours (especially fiber, protein, and vitamins), texture, and body that are lost in milling and other processing to the finished baked goods or other food(s).|$|R
5000|$|Breadsmith {{is focused}} on made-from-scratch, hand-crafted breads using the healthiest {{ingredients}} including <b>unbleached,</b> unbromated wheat <b>flour.</b> [...] Each store has a 6-ton stone hearth oven that can bake up to 160 loaves at one time, and the oven’s steam injection system gives the breads their distinctive European-style crust. Breadsmith stores {{can be found in}} 35 locations in 14 states including Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, New Jersey, North Dakota, South Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin. Most stores provide loaves to retail shoppers, as well as restaurants and grocers via wholesale partnerships. Breadsmith prides itself on its corporate social responsibility. Each Breadsmith store donates bread, time, and other products to help people in their community. In addition, all of the stores donate day-old bread to shelters and soup kitchens.|$|R
