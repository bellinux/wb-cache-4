40|$|This chapter {{presents}} the different standardization methods of terms {{at the two}} basic approaches, non-linguistic and linguistic techniques, and to justify the application of processes based on Finite-State Transducers (FST). Standardization of terms is the procedure of matching and grouping together variants of the same term that are semantically equivalent. A term variant is a text occurrence that is conceptually related to an original term {{and can be used}} to search for information in text database. The <b>uniterm</b> and multiterm variants can be considered equivalent units for the purposes of automatic indexing. This chapter describes the computational and linguistic base of the finite-state approach, with emphasis on the influence of the formal language theory in the standardization process of uniterms and multiterms.

40|$|Purpose – To {{propose a}} {{categorization}} {{of the different}} conflation procedures at the two basic approaches, non-linguistic and linguistic techniques, and to justify the application of normalization methods {{within the framework of}} linguistic techniques. Design/methodology/approach – Presents a range of term conflation methods, {{that can be used in}} information retrieval. The <b>uniterm</b> and multiterm variants can be considered equivalent units for the purposes of automatic indexing. Stemming algorithms, segmentation rules, association measures and clustering techniques are well evaluated non-linguistic methods, and experiments with these techniques show a wide variety of results. Alternatively, the lemmatisation and the use of syntactic pattern-matching, through equivalence relations represented in finite-state transducers (FST), are emerging methods for the recognition and standardization of terms. Findings – The survey attempts to point out the positive and negative effects of the linguistic approach and its potential as a term conflation method.

[...] Here Taube developed Coordinate Indexing, and important innovation {{in the field of}} Library Science. Taube defines Coordinate Indexing as, “the analysis of any field of information into a set of terms and the combination of these terms in any order to achieve any desired degree of detail in either indexing or selection." [...] Coordinate Indexing used “uniterms” to make storing and retrieving information easier and faster. [...] <b>Uniterms</b> “constitute a special set of rules and requirements which makes both the analysis into terms and the combination of the terms in order to specify items of information a remarkably simple and efficient process.” Taube had split coordinate indexing into two categories, item and term indexing. [...] It used punch cards and a machine reader to search for specific items or documents by terms or keywords. [...] Documentation, Inc. also brought forth the IBM 9900 Special Index Analyzer, also known as COMAC. COMAC stood for “continuous multiple access controller.” This machine handled data punch cards, used for information storage and retrieval.

40|$|Discutir as crises ou os eventos paroxísticos que simulem crises epilépticas, enfatizando as diferenças semiológicas entre elas e as perspectivas terapêuticas. Realizamos uma revisão da {{literatura}}, selecionando artigos nas bases de dados Medline e Bireme, a partir dos unitermos: "non-epileptic seizures", "psychogenic seizures". As crises não-epilépticas (CNE) podem ser classificadas em fisiológicas (síncope, migrânea, ataque isquêmico transitório) e em psicogênicas (voluntárias ou não). O padrão-ouro para a diferenciação entre as crises epilépticas e as CNE é o videoeletroencefalograma, mas vários dados semiológicos podem auxiliar esse processo. O tratamento das CNE baseia-se em psicoterapia e em farmacoterapia direcionadas aos transtornos psiquiátricos comórbidos. Apesar de a alta prevalência das CNE e de sua elevada morbidade, são escassos os estudos na literatura nacional. São muitos os desafios diagnósticos e terapêuticos. Assim, o psiquiatra atentar-se à sua ocorrência, evitando iatrogenia, como o uso desnecessário de drogas antiepilépticas. To discuss paroxysmal {{events that}} mimic epileptic seizures {{with emphasis on}} their semiologic differences and therapeutic perspectives. We did a narrative {{review of the literature}} based on selected papers in Medline and Bireme after searching for the <b>uniterms</b> "non-epileptic seizures" and "psychogenic seizures". Nonepileptic seizures (NES) can be classified in physiological (syncope, migraine, transitory ischemic attack) and psychogenic (voluntary or involuntary). The gold-standard in the differentiation of epileptic and nonepileptic seizures is the video-electroencefalogram, but many semiologic features can contribute to this process. The treatment of NES is based mainly on psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy directed to comorbid psychiatric disorders. Despite the high prevalence and elevated morbidity of the NES, there are just few studies on this subject in the Brazilian literature. There are many diagnostic and therapeutic challenges related to NES. Hence, psychiatrists {{should be aware of the}} occurrence of NES, avoiding iatrogenic interventions such as the unnecessary administration of anti-epileptic drugs...|$|R

It goes on to discuss the problems of automatic classification in general, and to consider various methods that have been proposed.

Some programming techniques are indicated, and the paper concludes with a discussion of the difficulties of adequately evaluating the results of any automatic classification procedure. The C. L. R. U. Information Retrieval Experiment Since the work on classification and grouping now being carried out at the C. L. R. U. arose out of the Unit's original information retrieval experiment, I shall describe this experiment briefly. The Unit's approach represented an attempt to combine descriptors and <b>uniterms.</b> Documents in the Unit's research library of offprints were indexed by their most important terms or keywords, and these were then arranged in a multiple lattice hierarchy. The inclusion relation in this system was interpreted, very informally, as follows: term A includes term B if, when you ask for a document containing A, you do not mind getting one containing B. A particular term could be subsumed under as many others as seemed appropriate, so that the system contained meets as well as joins, that is, was a lattice as opposed to a tree, for example as follows: The system was realized using punched cards. There was a card per term, with the accession numbers of the documents containing the term punched on it; at the right hand side of the card were the numbers of * This document is based on lectures given at the Linguistic Research Center of the University of Texas, and elsewhere in the United States, in the spring of 1963.

Sujeitos e métodos: a revisão foi realizada a partir da busca eletrônica de artigos publicados e indexados nas bases bibliográficas MedLine e SciELO, além da busca manual em periódico brasileiro e na lista de referências bibliográficas dos artigos identificados pelos unitermos "maternal near miss". Os artigos foram qualitativamente avaliados pelo tipo de desenho de estudo, procedência, disponibilidade de dados originais e tipo de critério utilizado para a definição de near miss. Foi ainda realizado um estudo descritivo em um centro terciário de referência à saúde da mulher, entre 01 de julho de 2003 e 30 de junho de 2004. De 2. 929 mulheres que tiveram parto na instituição, foram identificados os casos de morbidade grave segundo critérios propostos por Mantel e Waterstone, através de visita diária às instalações da maternidade. A revisão dos prontuários e a coleta dos dados de interesse foram realizadas no momento da alta hospitalar. As principais medidas de efeito estudadas foram: a ocorrência de near miss e seus fatores determinantes primários, critério de identificação como near miss, tempo total de permanência hospitalar, tempo de permanência em UTI e número e tipos de procedimentos especiais realizados. Resultados: Foram incluídos na revisão 33 estudos da literatura, com uma razão média de near miss de 7, 5 / 1000 partos. No centro de referência foram identificados 124 casos de near miss, correspondente a uma razão de 42 / 1000 partos, e ocorreram dois óbitos maternos. Foram realizados 126 procedimentos especiais, 102 deles realizados em mulheres admitidas na UTI para suporte intensivo (80, 9 %). O número médio de procedimentos especiais por mulher foi de 1, 04 (± 1, 91) e os mais freqüentes foram a instalação de acesso venoso central, a realização de ecocardiografia e a ventilação artificial invasiva. A média de permanência hospitalar foi de 10, 3 dias (± 13, 24). O tempo de permanência hospitalar e o número de procedimentos especiais foram significativamente maiores quando utilizados os critérios de Mantel. Conclusões: A incidência de near miss tende a ser maior nos países em desenvolvimento e quando utilizada a definição de disfunção orgânica. A incidência de near miss foi elevada e os critérios propostos por Mantel permitiram a identificação de um subgrupo de mulheres com manejo clínico mais complexo, considerando-se o tempo de permanência hospitalar e a demanda por procedimentos especiais. Os determinantes primários de morbidade materna grave foram coincidentes com as principais causa básicas conhecidas de morte materna. Objectives: {{to perform a}} wide review of the international and national literature and to combine reported data on the occurrence of severe maternal morbidity (near miss) in several contexts; to evaluate the occurrence of near-miss in a tertiary Brazilian maternity, using different sets of criteria, to identify their primary determinants, their demand for care and the maternal and fetal outcomes. Methods: the review was performed through an electronic search of the published articles indexed in the bibliographic databases of MedLine and SciELO, besides a manual search in Brazilian journal and {{in the list of}} references of the articles identified through the <b>uniterms</b> "maternal near miss". The articles were qualitatively evaluated according to their study design, local, availability of original data and kind of criteria used for the definition of near miss. A descriptive study was also performed at a tertiary referral center for the women?s health, between 1 st. July 2003 to 30 th. June 2004. From the total of 2929 women who delivered at the institution during the period, the cases of maternal near miss morbidity were identified through a daily visit in the wards of the maternity according to the criteria proposed by Mantel and by Waterstone. At the moment of hospital discharge a review of the clinical records and data collection were performed. The main outcome measures studied were the occurrence of near miss and their primary determinant factors, criteria for identification as a near miss case, total time of hospital stay, time of stay in ICU and number and kind of special procedures performed. Results: thirty three studies were identified and evaluated as adequate for inclusion in the review and the mean near miss ratio was 7. 5 / 1000 deliveries. A total of 124 cases of near-miss were identified in the referral center, corresponding to a ratio of 42 / 1000 deliveries, and there were two maternal deaths. For these cases, 126 special procedures were performed, 102 of them among women admitted in ICU for intensive care (80. 9 %). The mean number of special procedures by each woman was 1. 04 (± 1. 91) and the most frequent were central venous access, echocardiography and invasive mechanical ventilation. The mean total time of hospital stay was 10. 3 days (± 13. 24). The total time of hospital stay and the number of special procedures were significantly higher when the criteria of Mantel were used. Conclusions: there is a trend of higher incidence of near miss in developing countries and when using the definition of organ dysfunction. The incidence of near miss was high and the criteria proposed by Mantel allowed the identification of a sub-group of women with a more complex clinical management, considering the total time of hospital stay and the demand for special procedures. The primary determinants of severe maternal morbidity were coincident with the main known basic causes of maternal death...|$|R
