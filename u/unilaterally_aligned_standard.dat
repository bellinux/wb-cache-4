40|$|Aligning {{digital library}} {{resources}} with {{national and state}} educational standards to help K- 12 teachers search for relevant curriculum {{is an important issue}} in the digital library community. <b>Aligning</b> <b>standards</b> from different states promises to help teachers in one state find appropriate materials created and cataloged elsewhere. Although such alignments provide a powerful means for crosswalking standards and curriculum across states, alignment matrices are intrinsically sparse. Hence, we hypothesize that such sparseness may cause significant numbers of false negatives when used for searching curriculum. Our preliminary results confirm the false negative hypothesis, demonstrate the usefulness of term-based techniques in addressing the false negative problem, and explore ways to combine term occurrence data with standards correlations...|$|R

40|$|Educators, reformers, and {{commissions}} have long underscored {{the need to}} align all levels of education and build a seamless, coordinated P- 16 system. Failing to do so, they have argued, has kept too many students from pursuing an advanced education and the nation from benefiting from a more educated populace. Such {{was the case in}} the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when reformers first began to wrestle with the proper alignment of America?s loose educational structure. Now, one hundred years later, the nation?s governors and other reformers continue to argue that we need to <b>align</b> <b>standards</b> and missions between secondary and higher education.

40|$|Compared with {{electrical}} interconnects, optical interconnects offer several advantages, such as higher {{channel bandwidth}} and density, longer reach, and insensitivity to electro-magnetic interference. We developed an optical {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) technology platform and demonstrate a 12 × 10 Gbps optical link between boards. Embedded polymer waveguides guide the optical signals, which are generated and detected by 12 -channel optoelectronic modules. A polymer waveguide flex is used as optical link between boards. All connections between elements are based on passively <b>aligned,</b> <b>standard</b> MT interfaces, keeping costs low and providing compatibility with parallel fiber optics. The technology is also compatible with standard PCB processes. Optical Interconnects The increasing performance of microprocessors leads to higher bandwidth requirements for the data flow {{to and from the}} processor. Today, all signaling on a PCB is performed electrically, using copper lines that are integrated in the board. However, issues such as propagation loss and interchannel crosstalk, limit the scalability of electrical interconnects to ever higher bandwidth densities.

40|$|Unreliability in marking is well {{documented}} yet we lack studies that have investigated assessors’ detailed use of assessment criteria. This project used a form of Kelly’s Repertory Grid method to examine the characteristics that 24 experienced, UK assessors notice in distinguishing between students’ performance in four contrasting subject disciplines: that is their implicit assessment criteria. Variation in the choice, ranking and scoring of criteria was evident. Inspection of the individual construct scores in a sub-sample of academic historians revealed five factors {{in the use of}} criteria that contribute to marking inconsistency. The results imply that whilst more effective and social marking processes that encourage sharing of standards in institutions and disciplinary communities may help <b>align</b> <b>standards,</b> assessment decisions at this level are so complex, intuitive and tacit that variability is inevitable. It concludes that universities should be more honest with themselves and with students and actively help students to understand that application of assessment criteria is a complex judgement and there is rarely an incontestable interpretation of their meaning...|$|R
