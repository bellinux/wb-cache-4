40|$|Introduction: Palliative care is an {{approach}} that improves {{the quality of life}} of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness. Palliative care must be a part of every medical personnel’s practice. But still medical education curriculums have not included palliative care in its syllabus, sufficiently due to which most of the health professional are not aware about this specialty. The purpose of this study is to find out the perception of the medical students in palliative care in a teaching hospital. &# 13; Methods: A descriptive study was done among 270 <b>undergraduate</b> <b>medical</b> students <b>studying</b> in Institute of Medicine using a self structured pretested questionnaire. Data was entered in Microsoft Excel and analyzed by using SPSS 21. &# 13; Results: Of the total 270 <b>undergraduate</b> <b>medical</b> students only 152 has heard the word “palliative care”.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Components {{of professionalism}} in <b>undergraduate</b> <b>medical</b> <b>studies</b> at the University of Pretoria (UP) were {{previously}} defined as nine ‘Golden Threads’. Although specific outcomes were formulated for the threads, {{the need for}} more explicit professional standards became increasingly evident. The restructuring of the health system in South Africa contributed to {{the need for more}} explicit standards. The Charter for Medical Professionalism was developed during 2006 - 2008 as a reference document within the local context to serve as a standard for professionalism in the medical curriculum. Another aim was to guide academics in medical studies to act as good role models of professional behaviour. OBJECTIVE. To document the development of the Charter for Medical Professionalism and to evaluate lecturer and student perceptions on the formulation of the Charter to make appropriate changes and increase acceptance. METHODS. The project took the form of action research, and a working group comprising academics from UP’s Faculty of Health Sciences developed the Charter from relevant source documents, employing thematic and content analysis and recursive abstraction. An online survey was conducted to assess lecturer and student acceptance of the Charter. RESULTS. The outcomes-based approach was perceived as acceptable and appears to broaden the scope of assessment of professionalism. CONCLUSION. Inclusion of outcomes proposed by other work groups relating to research, practice management, teaching, mentoring and leadership roles of the medical doctor may be considered in future.

40|$|Objectives: The rise in {{lifestyle}} diseases {{has resulted}} in primary physicians advising more patients {{on the benefits of}} nutritional modifications. However, nutrition education has remained more or less unchanged in the <b>undergraduate</b> <b>medical</b> curriculum. This <b>study</b> aimed to assess the perceptions of medical graduates regarding nutrition education in their undergraduate curriculum. Methods: A total of 125 medical graduates from the Gulf Medical University in Ajman, United Arab Emirates, were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey from May to October 2012. The validated pilot-tested questionnaire was designed to assess perceptions regarding nutrition education in the <b>undergraduate</b> <b>medical</b> curriculum. Results: A total of 65 medical graduates responded to the survey, of which 55 % were female. Of the respondents, 32 % were general physicians and 68 % were specialists in various disciplines.

40|$|Background: The UK Clinical Aptitude Test (UKCAT) {{has been}} shown to have a modest but {{statistically}} significant ability to predict aspects of academic performance throughout medical school. Previously, this ability {{has been shown}} to be incremental to conventional measures of educational performance for the first year of <b>medical</b> school. This <b>study</b> evaluates whether this predictive ability extends throughout the whole of <b>undergraduate</b> <b>medical</b> <b>study</b> and explores the potential impact of using the test as a selection screening tool. Methods: This was an observational prospective study, linking UKCAT scores, prior educational attainment and sociodemographic variables with subsequent academic outcomes during the 5 years of UK <b>medical</b> <b>undergraduate</b> training. The participants were 6812 entrants to UK medical schools in 2007 – 8 using the UKCAT. The main outcome was academic performance at each year of medical school. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was also conducted, treating the UKCAT as a screening test for a negative academic outcome (failing at least 1 year at first attempt). Results: All four of the UKCAT scale scores significantly predicted performance in theory- and skills-based exams. After adjustment for prior educational achievement, the UKCAT scale scores remained significantly predictive for most years. Findings from the ROC analysis suggested that, if used as a sole screening test, with the mean applicant UKCAT score as the cut-off, the test could be used to reject candidates at high risk of failing at least 1 year at first attempt. However, the ‘number needed to reject’ value would be high (at 1. 18), with roughly one candidate who would have been likely to pass all years at first sitting being rejected for every higher risk candidate potentially declined entry on this basis. Conclusions: The UKCAT scores demonstrate a statistically significant but modest degree of incremental predictive validity throughout undergraduate training. Whilst the UKCAT could be considered a fairly crude screening tool for future academic performance, it may offer added value when used in conjunction with other selection measures. Future work should focus on the optimum role of such tests within the selection process and the prediction of post-graduate performance...|$|R

For females, both mean BMI and WHR were highest for Malay, followed by those for Indian and Chinese. No correlation was found between BMI and WHR among the overall and male participants respectively. However significant correlation was present between BMI and WHR among female participants (r value = 0. 623). In conclusion, in this research, there was correlation between BMI and WHR in female population.

40|$|Ultrasound and cadavers {{are both}} {{recognized}} teaching modalities for {{the delivery of}} cardiac anatomy to <b>undergraduate</b> <b>medical</b> students. This <b>study</b> considers the additive effect of the two teaching modalities.

The results of this study show a small increase in knowledge after experiencing two modalities, but this increase was not significant. Furthermore, the order in which students received their tuition also made no significant difference. These data suggests there is no additive effect of combining cadaveric prosections with ultrasound. This has implications for curriculum design.

The I CAN! questionnaire, based on the tuning-medicine project, is an instrument designed to measure this. The construction and validation of the questionnaire Greek, and graduates' answers to the open question "if you could change one thing in your school, what would this be?" have been described elsewhere. The aim {{of this paper was}} to present how of the instrument works and the responses of medical graduates to its closed questions. METHOD The I CAN! questionnaire consists of 104 randomly arranged closed questions, based on the tuning-medicine level-two learning outcomes for <b>undergraduate</b> <b>medical</b> education in Europe, organized into 16 level-one outcomes, 12 for medical competencies and 4 for professionalism. The questionnaire was distributed to the graduates of Greek medical schools during the summer and autumn 2009 graduation. Their responses were coded (disagree absolutely= 0, disagree= 20, disagree moderately= 40, agree moderately= 60, agree= 80, agree absolutely= 100). The mean question, level-one outcomes and overall scores were calculated, and interpreted as: < 50 very poor, 50 - 60. 9 poor, 61 - 70. 9 fairly poor, 71 - 78. 9 fairly good, 79 - 88. 9 good, 89 - 100 very good. Results Completed questionnaires were provided by 408 graduates of 6 medical schools, representing 55 % of the total graduate population: 45 % male, 55 % female. They were graduates of the Universities of: Athens 148 (48 % of graduates), Thessaloniki 147 (71 %), Thrace 38 (81 %), Ioannina 12 (17 %), Crete 32 (47 %), and Thessaly 31 (100 %). On average they self-assessed their overall ability at 74 % (i. e., in the "moderately good" interpretation zone), their ability to prescribe drugs 65 % and to apply evidence-based medicine 68 %, being a global doctor 80 % and possessing professional atributes 83 %. They considered themselves weaker in specific areas: Carrying out blood transfusion (37 %), requesting autopsy (52 %), administering intravenous therapy and using infusion devices (55 %), completing correctly a death certificate (57 %), matching appropriate drugs and other treatment to the clinical context (58 %), and using diagnostic and therapeutic options available through other health professions (59 %). They reported strength in: messuring blood pressure (96 %), carrying out electrocardiography (92 %), will to succeed (92 %), maintaining confidentiality (91 %), recognizing their own limits and asking for help (88 %). Conclusions The I CAN! self-assessment questionnaire can identify the perceived strengths and weaknesses of medical graduates, offering the basis for implementation of a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) and evidence-based educational policy. Medical schools could use the instrument to monitor progress towards competence of tomorrow's doctors, and to assess effectiveness of policy changes. If all European medical schools were to use it on every graduate cohort, a time series database could be created to serve administrative, research and other purposes. © Athens Medical Society...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recently {{there is}} a growing concern about stress during <b>undergraduate</b> <b>medical</b> training. However, <b>studies</b> about the same are lacking from Pakistani medical schools. The {{objectives}} of our study were to assess perceived stress, sources of stress and their severity and to assess the determinants of stressed cases. Methods A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey was carried out among <b>undergraduate</b> <b>medical</b> students of CMH Lahore Medical College, Pakistan during January to March 2009. Perceived stress was assessed using the perceived stress scale. A 33 -item questionnaire was used to assess sources of stress and their severity. Results The overall response rate was 80. 5 % (161 out of 200 students). The overall mean perceived stress was 30. 84 (SD = 7. 01) and was significantly higher among female students. By logistic regression analysis, stressed cases were associated with occurrence of psychosocial (OR 5. 01, 95 % CI 2. 44 - 10. 29) and academic related stressors (OR 3. 17 95 % CI 1. 52 - 6. 68). The most common sources of stress were related to academic and psychosocial concerns. 'High parental expectations', 'frequency of examinations', 'vastness of academic curriculum', 'sleeping difficulties', 'worrying about the future', 'loneliness', 'becoming a doctor', 'performance in periodic examinations' were the most frequently and severely occurring sources of stress. There was a negative but insignificant correlation between perceived stress and academic performance (r = - 0. 099, p > 0. 05). Conclusion A higher level of perceived stress was reported by the students. The main stressors were related to academic and psychosocial domains. Further studies are required to test the association between stressed cases and gender, academic stressors and psychosocial stressors. </p...|$|R
