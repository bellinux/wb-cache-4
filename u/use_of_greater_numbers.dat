40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate nurses’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding evidence-based practice（ EBP） in Tanzania. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire survey regarding EBP was conducted among nurses working in Muhimbili University Hospital, which is a teaching hospital, and three other non-teaching hospitals from October to December 2016. The questionnaire consisted of 10 measures regarding EBP in addition to demographic characteristics and EBP training experience. Results: A total of 143 nurses participated in the questionnaire survey regarding EBP, and 131 completed questionnaires without missing data {{were included in the}} analysis. Nurses working in Muhimbili University Hospital were more likely to receive EBP training than those working in the other institutions （chi-square test, P = 0. 015 ）. Recognition of the importance of receiving EBP （P = 0. 019 ）, frequency of using print information resources（ P = 0. 009 ）, and frequency of using electronic resources （P = 0. 001 ） were significantly higher among nurses with EBP training. Nurses with EBP training experience reported the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>greater</b> <b>numbers</b> of research articles as well as printed and electronic resources for EBP. EBP training for nurses may improve the capacity for research using appropriate resources and access for EBP. Conclusion: EBP training programs should be targeted toward nurses with a diploma, those not working in Muhimbili University Hospital, and those without EBP training. The concerns of nurse managers and/or supervisors should also be addressed to achieve EBP among staff nurses in clinical settings...|$|E

30|$|We {{believe the}} {{approach}} to the distal femur causes femoral plates to be more associated with functional pain, <b>use</b> <b>of</b> crutches, or impaired range of motion. Dissection of the distal femur for placement of the plates involves the iliotibial band or vastus medialis, which are both {{actively involved in the}} biomechanics of the knee. In addition, accurate insertion of a plate on the lateral aspect of the distal femur commonly requires violation of the joint capsule. Iatrogenic injury to any of these structures, and particularly the joint capsule, would contribute to the symptoms of post-operative delay in return of function. As for the etiology of the delayed function with the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plates and bilateral operations, it is intuitive that both will lead to more soft tissue manipulation, causing increased post-operative pain and range of motion impairment.|$|R

30|$|Although {{analysis}} exhibited with {{statistical significance}} {{a higher rate}} of delayed post-operative return of function for patients 11  years of age and older, we believe the finding is an artifact of other factors not explicitly related to an underlying physiological process unique to older patients.

A framework of previously quality controlled stations is used to define the initial station network to minimize the effects of any pervasive biases in the raw data upon the adjustments. The analysis is subsequently expanded to consider all remaining available long-term records. The final data set consists of 676 radiosonde stations, with a bias toward continental Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Temperature anomaly time series are provided on 9 mandatory reporting pressure levels from 850 to 30 hPa.

Two hundred and eighty-six orange roughy specimens were collected from seven general localities: the Great Australian Bight; South Australia (off southeastern Kangaroo Island); the west coast of Tasmania; the east coast of Tasmania; New South Wales; New Zealand and South Africa. Mitochondrial DNA was extracted from developing ovary tissue and analysed with 10 six-base enzymes and 3 four-base enzymes.

40|$|Abstract (Summary) Sibling {{teaching}} can be theoretically understood within {{current social}} cognitive frameworks via concepts of guided participation and scaffolding (Vygotsky, 1978), {{where the teacher}} creates supportive situations to help the learner extend current skills and knowledge (Rogoff, 1990). Evidence suggests that young school-aged children adjust their problem-solving strategies according to task requirements and characteristics such as speed and accuracy (Garner & Rogoff, 1990). Moreover, young school-aged sibling teachers demonstrate early signs of scaffolding during teaching (Perez-Granados & Callanan, 1997). The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate whether older siblings would adjust their strategies while teaching their younger siblings a series of block tasks increasing in difficulty. Results indicated that older siblings effectively scaffolded for their younger siblings by providing a <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> teaching strategies in the more challenging tasks. Also, across all tasks, siblings were more likely to employ a <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> strategies when learners were younger. Finally, a larger age gap between older and younger siblings was related to <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> teaching strategies across all tasks. Findings are discussed in terms of their contribution to the knowledge of children's abilities to teach their younger siblings and how these interactions may promote cognitive, social and emotional skills for both teachers and learners. Clearly, teachers took account of developmental differences in their scaffolding strategies and results provide strong support for current social cognitive approaches (Rogoff, 1990...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the association of}} clinical and demographic variables in patients requiring blood transfusion during elective surgery to treat scoliosis {{with the aim of}} identifying markers predictive of the need for blood transfusion. METHODS: Based on the review of medical charts at a public university hospital, this retrospective study evaluated whether the following variables were associated with the need for red blood cell transfusion (measured by the number <b>of</b> packs <b>used)</b> during scoliosis surgery: scoliotic angle, extent of arthrodesis (number of fused levels), sex of the patient, surgery duration and type of scoliosis (neuromuscular, congenital or idiopathic). RESULTS: Of the 94 patients evaluated in a 55 -month period, none required a massive blood transfusion (most patients needed less than two red blood cell packs). The number of packs was not significantly associated with sex or type of scoliosis. The extent of arthrodesis (r =  0. 103), surgery duration (r =  0. 144) and scoliotic angle (r =  0. 004) were weakly correlated with the need for blood transfusion. Linear regression analysis showed an association between the number of spine levels submitted to arthrodesis and the volume <b>of</b> blood <b>used</b> in transfusions (p =  0. 001). CONCLUSION: This study did not reveal any evidence of a significant association between the need for red blood cell transfusion and scoliotic angle, sex or surgery duration in scoliosis correction surgery.

40|$|A {{change in}} {{perspective}} can be certified {{in the recent}} years to technology-enhanced learning research and development: More and more learning applications on the web are putting the learner centre stage, not the organisation. They empower learners with capabilities to customize and even construct their own personal learning environments (PLEs). These PLEs typically consist of distributed web-applications and services that support system-spanning collaborative and individual learning activities in formal as well as informal settings. These PLEs typically complement Learning Management Systems (LMS) with additional widgets, services, and data integrated from and with organization-external learning tools. Technologically speaking, this shift manifests in a learning web where information is distributed across sites and activities can easily encompass the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pages and services offered through web-based learning applications. Mash-ups, the 'frankensteining' of software artefacts and data, have emerged to be the software development approach for these long-tail and perpetual-beta niche markets. Core technologies facilitating this paradigm shift are Ajax, javascript-based widget-collections, and microformats that help to glue together public web APIs in individual applications. Interoperability is the enabler to allow these different components to be worked together facilitating the achievement of the underlying learning task. In a wide range of European IST-funded research projects such as Stellar, ROLE, LTfLL, Mature, and OpenScout a rising passion for these technologies can be identified. This workshop therefore serves as a forum to bring together researchers and developers from these projects and an open public that have an interest in understanding and engineering mash-up personal learning environments (MUPPLEs). ...|$|R

This study aimed at characterizing and identifying the impact of clinical and functional conditions on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in obese old women. The HRQoL was assessed by the questionnaires "Outcomes Study Short Form- 36 Health Survey" (SF- 36) and "Impact of Weight on Quality of Life - Lite" (IWQOL - Lite), which were applied to 63 women with body mass index &# 8805; 30 kg/m 2. Regression models were developed for general (SF- 36) and specific (IWQOL-Lite) HRQoL. The associated factors investigated were: age, number of medicines, number of diseases, depressive symptoms, body mass index, grip strength, level of physical activity, and functional performance. The old women had {{a low level of}} strength and physical activity. Their functional performance was good to moderate, but a third of the sample presented deficit of mobility. The level of physical activity and functional performance had a positive impact on the general HRQoL and number of drugs had a negative one (R 2 = 0. 44). Depressive symptoms and body mass index negatively affected the specific HRQoL (R 2 = 0. 57). The study concluded that obese old women with depressive symptoms, low levels of physical activity, and functional performance, making <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> drugs, are more vulnerable to experiencing poor HRQoL.

40|$|AbstractIn a {{traditional}} automotive cooling system, energy optimization {{could be achieved}} by controlling the engine temperature by means of several sensors placed inside the cooling circuit. Nevertheless, {{in some cases the}} increasing <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sensor devices makes the control system too bulky, expensive and not sufficiently robust for the intended application. This paper presents the development of a heavy-duty automotive cooling axial fan with morphing blades activated by Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) strips that work as actuator elements in the polymeric blade structure. The blade was designed to achieve the activation of the strips (thermo-mechanically treated on purpose) by means of an air stream flow. With the aimof studying the morphing capability of the adaptive structure together with the recovery behavior of the NiTi strips, four different polymeric compounds have been compared in a specifically-designed wind tunnel. As the airstream flow increases its temperature, the strips recover the memorized bent shape, leading to a camber variation. To study the possibility of employing SMA strips as actuator elements, a comparison with common viscous clutchbehavior is proposed. The time range actuator response indicates that the SMA strips provide a lower frequency control that fits well with the engine coolant thermal requirement. The experimental results demonstrate the capability of SMA materials to accommodate the lower power actuators in the automotive field. This innovative passive control system results from the selection of (i) the memorized shape of the SMA strips and (ii) the polymeric compound used for the blade structure...|$|R

METHODS: From our Hypertension Centre, 4551 subjects (43. 4 % women; age 51 +/- 12 years) were selected with available data for metabolic and cardiovascular evaluation (no prevalent cardiovascular disease), at the last control visit. A modified Adult Treatment Panel III definition of metabolic syndrome was adopted changing waist girth for body mass index (>or= 30 kg/m 2). Blood pressure was considered controlled when supine office blood pressure was below 140 / 90 mmHg, or uncontrolled if this target was not achieved. Blood pressure control has been evaluated in relation to metabolic risk factors, adjusting for age, sex, {{and the number of}} antihypertensive medications. RESULTS: The metabolic syndrome phenotype was found in 1444 individuals (31. 72 %). The probability of uncontrolled blood pressure was 43 % higher in patients with the metabolic syndrome than in those without, independently of covariates. This probability was also confirmed in 728 untreated patients. The probability of uncontrolled blood pressure significantly and independently increased with the increasing number of metabolic risk factors. Uncontrolled blood pressure was also independently associated with the prescription of more medications. CONCLUSION: Insufficient control of blood pressure is independently associated with the presence of the metabolic syndrome. Blood pressure control worsens with the increasing number of metabolic risk factors associated with hypertension, despite the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> medications...|$|R
40|$|The last {{population}} of red-necked ostriches in West Africa {{was estimated at}} 1, 600 individuals in 1990, in the Air and Té- néré Nature Reserve, Niger. This population, which was already threatened because {{of the loss of}} its habitat, was faced with severe poaching ending in extermination during the conflict that opposed Tuareg rebels and the Nigérien armed forces from 1992 to 1997. The relationship between man and ostrich is ancestral and dates back several centuries in Niger. Cave drawings in the Air region also exhibit the cultural dimension this animal played within Tuareg society. Even today, traditional <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>great</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> this animal's ducts demonstrates the noteworthy economic role of the ostrich at the local level. Moreover, the Nigérien government has been reforming its development policy over the past several years. Environmental preservation and natural resource management are essential aspects of this policy. A project with the aim of reintroducing the ostrich in the Aïr region is therefore justified for both its safeguard and preservation role and for local development. These elements have helped us to define the main lines of a future project to reintroduce the ostrich into the Aïr-Ténéré Reserve. Giazzi Franck, Ciofolo Isabelle, Alvès Karine, Accent Mondial.
