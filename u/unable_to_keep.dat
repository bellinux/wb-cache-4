5|$|A {{successful}} {{demonstration of}} this last idea {{occurred in the}} game Pintér–Brynell at the 1998 Elista Olympiad. White answered Black's 21...b5 with 22.b4!, and Black was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the queenside open with 22...bxa4? because 23.bxc5 Rxb1 24.Rxb1 dxc5 25.Bxc5 would have left White's central pawns unstoppable.

5|$|Italian silk cloth {{was very}} expensive, {{as much a}} result {{of the cost of the}} raw {{material}} as of the production costs. The craftsmen in Italy proved <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with the exigencies of French fashion, which continuously demanded lighter and less expensive materials. These materials were used for clothing, and garment production began to be done locally. Nevertheless, Italian silk long remained among the most prized, mostly for furnishings and the brilliant colours of the dyes.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{to end the}} impasse, Shackleton agreed, in {{a letter}} to Scott dated 17 May 1907, to work to the east of the 170°W {{meridian}} and therefore to avoid all the familiar Discovery ground. In the end it was a promise that he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless. With his only other option being to return home, he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds, close to the old Discovery base. For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time.|$|E

60|$|Down {{the street}} where he had stolen in the dark with the dead body on his back, he almost ran for the cover of her house. The door was opened to him before he knocked, her arms were round his neck, her lips pressed to his. The fire was out, {{as if she had}} been <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> {{remember}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> warm. A stool had been drawn to the window, and there she had evidently been sitting, like a bird in a cage, looking out into the grey street. Though she had been told that he was not to come, instinct had kept her there; or the pathetic, aching hope against hope which lovers never part with.|$|R
5000|$|At {{first the}} {{magazine}} dealt predominantly with topics that concerned mainly women, like equality of rights, education, upbringing, hygiene and ethics. In {{the course of}} the work of the Iranian Women’s Society the topics started to be more political, whereby the national independence and the woman's role were addressed. Shokufeh claimed not to interfere in the men's political sphere, but was <b>unable</b> always <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> it, which brought the magazine under censorship. After Mozayen ol-Saltanehs death in 1919 the publication of Shokufeh was suspended.|$|R

5|$|Thomas {{established}} {{the project in}} the Runnymede Playhouse {{on the grounds of}} his wife's family estate in a wealthy residential section of Oakwood, a suburb of Dayton. He promised the Oakwood City Council that he would return the Runnymede Playhouse building intact after the war, but he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> this promise because the building became so badly contaminated with radioactivity. The facility, also known as Dayton Unit IV, was in use for nuclear work until 1949 when Mound Laboratories opened in Miamisburg, Ohio.

5|$|Veerangan {{now finds}} himself saddled {{with the role}} of king for more days than he had {{initially}} bargained for because of Marthandan's sudden disappearance. He does not let this setback deter him and puts the opportunity to good use by beginning many reforms, and enacting several measures to uplift the poor. These steps are supported by the people while causing a political upheaval among the elite. However, he is troubled {{by the fact that he}} is deceiving Manohari who believes him to be Marthandan. <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it a secret from her, he tells her the truth.

5|$|At 14:00 on 8 February, {{four days}} after leaving the Îles des Saintes, Junon was spotted passing close to the Virgin Islands by the small British brigs HMS Superieure and , who signalled the {{approaching}} ship to halt and prepare for boarding. Ignoring the orders from the smaller ships, Rousseau continued northwards, passing through the Virgin Islands closely followed by Superieure, although Asp was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up and fell far behind during the night. At 08:00 {{on the morning of}} 9 February, with Virgin Gorda northwest, Superieure was close enough to open fire, a few long range shots failing to damage the large frigate, which responded with an ineffective broadside. The gunfire attracted other ships, and during the afternoon Superieure was joined by the British frigate HMS Latona, under Captain Hugh Pigot.|$|E
5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years later}} Turner's team {{eliminated}} Blackburn Rovers, {{who at the}} time lay second in the First Division, in the fifth round of the FA Cup. They thus became the first Fourth Division side to reach the sixth round. In 1964–65, he led them to promotion from the Fourth Division, and three years later to the championship of the Third. By this time the young players who had been the mainstay of Oxford's rise through the divisions were ageing or retired. Turner had no money to strengthen the side for its Second Division campaign, and struggled with what he had. In April 1969, he became General Manager of the club, leaving the running of the team to Ron Saunders, and in February 1972 he was dismissed when the club admitted they were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him in post.|$|R

50|$|In some situations, {{overwriting}} {{circular buffer}} can be used, e.g. in multimedia. If the buffer {{is used as}} the bounded buffer in the producer-consumer problem then it is probably desired for the producer (e.g., an audio generator) to overwrite old data if the consumer (e.g., the sound card) is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> momentarily <b>keep</b> up. Also, the LZ77 family of lossless data compression algorithms operates {{on the assumption that}} strings seen more recently in a data stream are more likely to occur soon in the stream. Implementations store the most recent data in a circular buffer.|$|R
5|$|In his book, The World's Worst Warships, naval {{historian}} Antony Preston characterised the popovkas like this: But {{in other}} respects, {{they were a}} dismal failure.

In practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn {{out of control and}} even contra-rotating some of six propellers was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the ship on the correct heading. Nor could they cope with the rough weather which is frequently encountered in the Black Sea. They were prone to rapid rolling and pitching in anything more than a flat calm, and could not aim or load their guns under such circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Occupying {{the extreme}} eastern {{position}} of the blockade, Indiana fired at the cruisers Infanta María Teresa and Almirante Oquendo {{as they left the}} harbor, but, due to engine problems, was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with the Spanish cruisers as they fled to the west. When the Spanish destroyers Plutón and Furor emerged, Indiana was near the harbor entrance and, together with Iowa, she supported the armed yacht Gloucester in the destruction of the lightly armored enemy ships. She was then ordered to keep up the blockade of the harbor in case more Spanish ships came out and so played no role in the chase and sinking of the two remaining Spanish cruisers, Vizcaya and Cristóbal Colón.|$|E
5|$|On 5 October 1944, Lent flew his Junkers Ju-88 from Stade to Paderborn.

Lent {{was on his way}} to visit the Geschwaderkommodore of the Nachtjagdgeschwader 1, Hans-Joachim Jabs. During the landing approach, the left engine of the plane failed, causing the wing to dip. Lent was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the plane steady and it struck high-voltage cables and crashed. All four members of the crew sustained serious injuries but were rescued alive. Three crew members succumbed to their injuries by the next morning and Lent himself died two days later on 7 October 1944.|$|E
5000|$|Knorr {{was born}} Theresa Jimmie Francine Cross in Sacramento, California. She was the {{youngest}} of two daughters born to Swannie Gay (née Myers) and James [...] "Jim" [...] Cross.
