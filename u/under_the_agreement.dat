5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agreement</b> and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda.

5|$|Subsequent {{negotiations}} led by Jesuit papal legate Antonio Possevino {{resulted in}} the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski between Russia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. This was a humiliation for the Tsar, {{in part because he}} requested the truce. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> Russia would surrender all areas in Livonia it still held and the city of Dorpat to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, while Polotsk would remain under Commonwealth control. Any captured Swedish territory—specifically Narva—could be retained by the Russians and Velike Luki would be returned from Batory's control to Russia. Possevino made a half-hearted attempt to get John III's wishes taken into consideration, but this was vetoed by the Tsar, probably in collusion with Batory. The armistice, which fell short of a full peace arrangement, was to last ten years and was renewed twice, in 1591 and 1601. Batory failed in his attempts to pressure Sweden into relinquishing its gains in Livonia, particularly Narva.|$|E
5|$|The parties {{settled the}} lawsuit on July 25, 2011, and a {{majority}} of players signed union authorization cards.

5|$|Ashmole met the {{botanist}} and collector John Tradescant {{the younger}} around 1650. Tradescant had, with his father, {{built up a}} vast and renowned collection of exotic plants, mineral specimens and other curiosities {{from around the world}} at their house in Lambeth. Ashmole helped Tradescant catalogue his collection in 1652, and, in 1656, he financed the publication of the catalogue, the Musaeum Tradescantianum. In 1659, Tradescant, who had lost his only son seven years earlier, legally deeded his collection to Ashmole. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement,</b> Ashmole would take possession at Tradescant's death. When Tradescant died in 1662, his widow, Hester, contested the deed, claiming her husband had signed it when drunk without knowing its contents, but the matter was settled in Chancery in Ashmole's favour two years later. Hester was to hold the collection in trust for Ashmole until her death. Ashmole's determined aggressiveness in obtaining the Tradescant collection for himself has led some scholars to consider that Ashmole was an ambitious, ingratiating social climber who stole a hero's legacy for his own glorification.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, PETA {{went before}} Burger King's board of {{directors}} during its parent company's annual corporate meeting to request that poultry suppliers switched to a more-humane method of slaughter called controlled atmosphere killing (CAK). Instead of using its previous tactic of stating that the procedure is more humane, {{the group claimed that}} CAK was economically more feasible as it reduces the chances of injury to workers in poultry factories and it produces better products by preventing injury to the animal. Responding to the proposal in March 2007, Burger King announced it would make further changes to its animal-welfare policies. The new policies favor suppliers of chickens that utilize CAK rather than electric shock to knock birds unconscious before slaughter, and require its pork and poultry suppliers to upgrade the living conditions of pigs and chickens. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement,</b> 2% of BK's North American egg suppliers are to use cage-free-produced eggs and 10% of pork suppliers are to use crate-free pigs for its pork products. PETA and the Humane Society of the United States were quoted as saying that Burger King’s initiatives put it ahead of its competitors in terms of animal rights and welfare and that they were hopeful that the new initiatives would trigger reform throughout the fast food industry as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In August 1981 {{the program}} {{received}} a boost when British Aerospace (BAe) and McDonnell Douglas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), marking the UK's re-entry into the program. The British government was enticed by the lower cost of acquiring Harriers promised {{by a large}} production run, {{and the fact that}} the US was shouldering the expense of development. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> BAe was relegated to the position of a subcontractor, instead of the full partner status that would have been the case had the UK not left the program. Consequently, the company received, in man-hours, 40 percent of the airframe work-share. Aircraft production took place at McDonnell Douglas' facilities in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, and manufacturing by BAe at its Kingston and Dunsfold facilities in Surrey, England. Meanwhile, 75 percent work-share for the engine went to Rolls-Royce, which had previously absorbed Bristol Siddeley, with the remaining 25 percent assigned to Pratt & Whitney. The two companies planned to manufacture 400 Harrier IIs, with the USMC expected to procure 336 aircraft and the RAF, 60.|$|E
5|$|The University of King's College is a {{post-secondary}} {{institution in}} Halifax affiliated with Dalhousie. Established in 1789, {{it was the}} first post-secondary institution in English Canada and the oldest English-speaking Commonwealth university outside the United Kingdom. The University of King's College was formerly an independent institution located in Windsor, Nova Scotia, until 1920, when a fire ravaged its campus. To continue operation, the University of King's College accepted a generous grant from the Carnegie Foundation, although the terms of the grant required that it move to Halifax and enter into association with Dalhousie. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement,</b> King's agreed to pay the salaries of a number of Dalhousie professors, who in turn were to help in the management and academic life of the college.

Presently, students of both institutions are allowed to switch between the two throughout their enrolment.
