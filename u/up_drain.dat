50|$|Layard spent {{ten years}} in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), where he studied the local fauna with Robert Templeton. He {{was forced to leave}} Ceylon by his and his wife's poor health. Most of their {{children}} died in infancy. Before leaving Ceylon, Layard's collection resulted in the number of species going from 182 to 318 species. On one occasion, he was able to use his natural history skills while settling a land dispute in Ceylon between two neighbouring farmers. He settled the disputed position of a filled <b>up</b> <b>drain</b> by digging them up and noticing the remains of a species of mollusc, which was later named after him as Tortulosa layardi (Pfeiffer 1851), along the true drain path. His collections were sent off to England and amounted to 9 tons.|$|E

30|$|Harvesting the diatoms {{efficiently}} {{is a major}} problem. The following possibility {{may provide}} a solution. Dig a hole inside the lagoon. Dead diatoms will collect in this pit, also thanks {{to the fact that}} they are relatively heavy due to their silica skeletons. From time to time, this mass of dead diatoms can be sucked <b>up,</b> <b>drained</b> and transported to the biofuel plant.|$|R

50|$|No talk. Talking {{about the}} theory {{before it is}} written <b>up</b> <b>drains</b> the {{researcher}} of motivational energy. Talking can either render praise or criticism, and both diminish the motivational drive to write memos that develop and refine the concepts and the theory (Glaser 1998). Positive feedback makes researchers content with what they have and negative feedback hampers their self-confidence. Talking about the GT should be restricted to persons capable of helping the researcher without influencing her final judgments.|$|R

Gwen and Kevin show up, along with Professor Paradox, who teleports the gang back to the past to stop Vilgax's plan before it happens. Paradox gives the trio a message from Grandpa Max, who directs them to the planet Vulpin, home of Wildmutt, one of Ben's original aliens. Ben calls upon the Galvanic Mechomorph Ship to aid them.|$|R

All buildings and the major roads of Macquarie Street, Vernon Terrace and Skyring Terrace within the boundary of Woolstore Precinct were located high enough from the highest waterlevel recorded and thus were safe from the flood. River debris were washed {{up at the end of}} Commercial Road near the Teneriffe Ferry and also on the walkway outside Eve Restaurant.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{how to use}} a siphon to drain floodwaters. A siphon is a tube that conveys water to a lower level via point above the upper water level by gravity. A siphon can be set <b>up</b> to <b>drain</b> existing floodwaters more quickly than they would naturally and can also prevent flooding. Siphons are particularly useful in situations where no pump is available, and a drainage point exists lower than the level of the floodwaters. Some case studies are presented...|$|R
