50|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the 1990 Convention, money laundering techniques and anti-money laundering strategies had significantly evolved. For example, laundering techniques increasingly targeted the non-financial sector and used professional intermediaries to invest criminal proceeds in the legitimate economy. Many jurisdictions had set up Financial Intelligence Units to process suspicious or <b>unusual</b> <b>transaction</b> reports and thus triggered more laundering investigations. Those changes needed to be followed up by reassessing the Convention's focus, adjusting some of its requirements and supplementing it with additional provisions. In addition, some of these changes had already been included in standards set by other international fora (European Union, United Nations, FATF), which a new convention could not ignore. Rather, the text of the new Convention brought into line with these new developments to ensure mutual consistency with these standards and to make possible harmonised domestic responses in an appropriate legal format.|$|E

The man had been staying at the Borussia team hotel. He planted explosives along the road where the team bus would later leave to the stadium. During check-in, he chose {{a room with a}} window facing the road so {{he would be able to}} remotely trigger the explosion when the bus passed by. It was revealed that on the day of the attack, he had bought put warrants for €78,000 from an investment bank using the internet connection in his hotel room. These would have made him a large profit of up to €3.9 million if Dortmund's share price were to plummet after a successful attack, but it only dropped by 5% after the attack and later recovered. The <b>unusual</b> <b>transaction</b> raised suspicion of money laundering with bank employees, prompting them to alert authorities and pass to them the identity of Sergej W., which led to his arrest. Police also said Sergej W. left letters at the scene of the crime to frame Muslims for the attack.|$|E

The main goals of this project are to improve the Defense Finance and Accounting Service's (DFAS) ability to detect these payments and to reduce the manpower required to research them. By taking advantage of current data mining tools, DFAS hopes to enhance the precision of their predictions. The challenges of using data mining to address this business problem included establishing a data set of known fraudulent payments, a target population of normal payments, and a method by which to leverage the known cases in the training of detection models. As is typical in fraud detection, the set of known cases was very small relative {{to the number of}} non-fraud examples. The authors used a cross-validation approach so that all the known fraud payments could be used in training. Then after generating more than 90 models, eleven models were selected, and their individual decisions were combined via voting to make the final decision. The results improved sensitivity to the known fraud payments significantly while keeping false alarms acceptably low. 1...|$|R
40|$|At {{least since}} the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) first {{published}} its Forty Recommendations, financial institutions in FATF-compliant jurisdictions have been required to implement preventive measures that require FIs to identify customers, establish client profiles, monitor for <b>unusual</b> <b>transactions,</b> review those transactions {{to see if there}} was suspicion that they involved the proceeds of crime and, if so, report the transaction to the authorities in the form of a suspicious transaction report (STR). When these requirements were first established, neither financial institutions nor their supervisors/regulators had much experience as to what in a client 2 ̆ 7 s profile and the client 2 ̆ 7 s patterns of transactions might indicate money laundering. However, based on an expanding knowledge of how criminals tend to launder their money, over time financial institutions have developed increasingly effective detection and reporting systems. By studying known examples of laundering, the FATF, FATF-Style Regional Bodies, and national competent authorities (especially financial intelligence units) have identified patterns or indicators of possible money laundering, and made them available to financial institutions as money laundering typologies. In addition, there has been some feedback from financial intelligence units and other competent authorities to financial institutions with respect to their anti-money laundering programs. Using these sources, financial institutions have been able to develop systems to help them determine which transactions carry a materially greater risk that laundering is involved...|$|R
40|$|Analytic {{procedures}} allow auditors (or forensic accountants) {{to identify}} the presence of unexpected relationships among financial data, including <b>unusual</b> <b>transactions</b> or events, and to develop the scope of audit planning or investigation (Corbett and Clayton 2006, Bhattacharjee and Machuga 2004, Asare and Wright 2001). The effectiveness of analytic techniques e. g., trend analysis, ratio analysis, or a regression analysis depends on the precision of expectations developed (Kenyon and Tilton 2006). However, there is a caveat associated with these expectations. Specifically, Hitzig (2004) notes that “…because the expectation is specified by the auditor, and because the expectation’s parameters are estimated from data that may be misstated [or contain fraudulent transactions], {{there is a risk}} that reasonable expectations are incorrect… ” (p. 34). As such, the risk of failing to detect the presence of suspicious trends, patterns, or anomalies within the financial data likely exists. This problem is referred to herein as the risk of Type II error. On the other hand, analytic procedures infer propriety of individual transactions based on the reasonableness of aggregated account balances or classes of transactions (Stringer and Stewart 1986, p. 16).

40|$|Credit card fraud falls broadly {{into two}} categories: {{behavioural}} fraud and application fraud. Application fraud occurs when individuals obtain new credit cards from issuing companies using false personal information and then {{spend as much}} as possible in a short space of time. However, most credit card fraud is behavioural and occurs when details of legitimate cards have been obtained fraudulently and sales are made on a 'Cardholder Not Present' basis. These sales include telephone sales and e-commerce transactions where only the card details are required. In this paper, we are concerned with detecting behavioural fraud through the analysis of longitudinal data. These data usually consist of credit card transactions over time, but can include other variables, both static and longitudinal. Statistical methods for fraud detection are often classification (supervised) methods that discriminate between known fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions; however, these methods rely on accurate identification of fraudulent transactions in historical databases [...] information that is often in short supply or non-existent. We are particularly interested in unsupervised methods that do not use this information but instead detect changes in behaviour or <b>unusual</b> <b>transactions.</b> We discuss two methods for unsupervised fraud detection in credit data in this paper and apply them to some real data sets. Peer group analysis is a new tool for monitoring behaviour over time in data mining situations.
