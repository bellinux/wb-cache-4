5|$|On {{the evening}} of May 20, 2013, the general public witnessed, through a {{dedicated}} webcam, that the bulb had apparently burned out. The next morning, an electrician {{was called in to}} confirm its status. It was determined that the bulb had not burned out when the <b>uninterruptible</b> power supply was bypassed, using an extension cord. The dedicated power supply was found to have been faulty. Approximately seven hours had transpired before the light was reestablished.|$|E
25|$|Flywheel {{storage is}} also {{currently}} {{used in the}} form of the Diesel rotary <b>uninterruptible</b> power supply to provide <b>uninterruptible</b> power supply systems (such as those in large datacenters) for ride-through power necessary during transfer– that is, the relatively brief amount of time between a loss of power to the mains and the warm-up of an alternate source, such as a diesel generator.|$|E
25|$|<b>Uninterruptible</b> power {{supplies}} (UPS), where supercapacitors have replaced much larger banks of electrolytic capacitors. This combination reduces {{the cost per}} cycle, saves on replacement and maintenance costs, enables the battery to be downsized and extends battery life. A disadvantage {{is the need for}} a special circuit to reconcile the differing behaviors.|$|E
25|$|In Chile, 10A Magic {{connectors}} {{are commonly}} used for computer/laboratory power networks, {{as well as for}} communications or data equipment. This allows delicate electronics equipment to be connected to an independent circuit breaker, usually including a surge protector or an <b>uninterruptible</b> power supply backup. The different style of plug makes it more difficult for office workers to connect computer equipment to a standard unprotected power line, or to overload the UPS by connecting other office appliances.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources {{have signed}} in 2003 a $40 million trust fund {{agreement}} {{for the creation}} of the International Centre for Hydrogen Energy Technologies (UNIDO-ICHET) in Istanbul, which started operation in 2004. A hydrogen forklift, a hydrogen cart and a mobile house powered by renewable energies are being demonstrated in UNIDO-ICHET's premises. An <b>uninterruptible</b> power supply system has been working since April 2009 in the headquarters of Istanbul Sea Buses company.|$|E
25|$|With a {{contract}} signed in 1991, AECL, {{in partnership with}} MDS Nordion, began construction of the MAPLE dedicated isotope-production facility. Constructed on-site at AECL's Chalk River Laboratories this facility will house two reactors and an isotope processing facility. Each reactor {{is designed to be}} able to produce at least 100% of the world's medical isotopes, meaning that the second reactor will be used as a back-up to ensure an <b>uninterruptible</b> supply. The first reactor was started but did not satisfy some safety requirements. AECL halted the project in 2008 because the design was flawed.|$|E

The activities of the group are focused on Custom Power Devices, Power Controllers for tapping energy from non-conventional energy sources like wind and solar, Electric and Hybrid Vehicles, Automotive Electronics, Systems for Industrial Automation, Digital Controllers and Power Control Systems for Industrial application, Networking of Power Electronic systems and the Development {{of industrial}} control products like Variable Speed Drive systems, High Performance <b>Uninterruptible</b> Power Supply systems, High efficiency Switched Mode Power Converters, and Remote Controlled Mobile platforms.|$|E
25|$|Mania is a {{distinct}} period {{of at least one}} week of elevated or irritable mood, which can range from euphoria to delirium, and those experiencing hypo- or mania may exhibit three {{or more of the following}} behaviors: speak in a rapid, <b>uninterruptible</b> manner, short attention span, racing thoughts, increased goal-oriented activities, agitation, or they may exhibit behaviors characterized as impulsive or high-risk, such as hypersexuality or excessive spending. To meet the definition for a manic episode, these behaviors must impair the individual's ability to socialize or work. If untreated, a manic episode usually lasts three to six months.|$|E
25|$|Diodes {{will prevent}} {{currents}} in unintended directions. To supply power to an electrical circuit during a power failure, the circuit can draw current from a battery. An <b>uninterruptible</b> power supply may use diodes {{in this way}} to ensure that current is only drawn from the battery when necessary. Likewise, small boats typically have two circuits each with their own battery/batteries: one used for engine starting; one used for domestics. Normally, both are charged from a single alternator, and a heavy-duty split-charge diode is used to prevent the higher-charge battery (typically the engine battery) from discharging through the lower-charge battery when the alternator is not running.|$|E
25|$|A {{wet cell}} battery has a liquid electrolyte. Other names are flooded cell, since the liquid covers all {{internal}} parts, or vented cell, since gases produced during operation can {{escape to the}} air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as beakers, for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a concentration cell is important in understanding corrosion. Wet cells may be primary cells (non-rechargeable) or secondary cells (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the Daniell cell were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the Leclanche cell, Grove cell, Bunsen cell, Chromic acid cell, Clark cell, and Weston cell. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in automobile batteries and in industry for standby power for switchgear, telecommunication or large <b>uninterruptible</b> power supplies, but in many places batteries with gel cells have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or nickel–cadmium cells.|$|E
500|$|Originally, SvalSat used a {{combination}} of a 2 megabits per second (Mb/s) leased line, several Integrated Services Digital Network lines and a 55 Mbit/s [...] satellite Internet access via Intelsat for data transmission off the island. From 2004, the Svalbard Undersea Cable System gives two redundant fiber lines to the mainland, each providing 10 gigabits per second. The fiber connection is operated by Telenor. Power is supplied from Longyearbyen Power Station, In case of a power outage, the facility is equipped with an <b>uninterruptible</b> power supply and has a standby generator capable of supplying power for two weeks.|$|E

There are two stadiums, one for cross-country skiing and one for biathlon. The former has a spectator capacity for 31,000, while the latter has a capacity for 13,500. In addition, up to 75,000 people watched the events the trackside during the Olympics. Permanent buildings include a [...] finishing house for biathlon, a [...] finishing house for cross-country, a [...] plant room. The cross-country stadium is [...] long, while the biathlon stadium is [...] long. The biathlon stadium has 30 shooting stations. The facility has a 1,250kVA transformer, with an additional transformer used during the Olympics. Critical systems, such as computers and time-keeping equipment, have an <b>uninterruptible</b> power supply.|$|E
500|$|The RTC {{secured a}} new {{retractable}} screen by October 2010, from a New Windsor–based entertainment supplier, {{to replace the}} fixed screen that had obscured access to the Theatre's [...] stage. The new screen opened the stage by , allowing live acts. Under the Cacchios, the screen had been replaced once a decade, with an engineer performing maintenance once every six months. Eight Behringer stereo surround sound speakers and two subwoofers were installed in the building in December 2010. By February 2011, the RTC also added a digital projector, a stage thrust, a server for digital programming, and a new phone system. The group announced plans to add a concession stand, an additional server, and an <b>uninterruptible</b> power supply. The group also intended to move the ticket booth outside during warm months.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the speed}} in which artists fall from the decks, an array of airbags had to be used en lieu of {{traditional}} nets alone. [...] These airbags sit atop two nets, which at times are [...] below the point the artist begins the fall. [...] The airbags contain individual cells which can inflate and deflate independently. [...] In case a power outage occurs, each airbag has its own <b>uninterruptible</b> power supply which can last up to 30 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Virtually all {{devices that}} operate on {{electricity}} are {{adversely affected by}} the sudden removal of their power supply. [...] Solutions such as UPS (<b>uninterruptible</b> power supplies) or backup generators are available, but these are expensive. [...] Efficient methods of power storage would allow for devices to have a built-in backup for power cuts, and also reduce {{the impact of a}} failure in a generating station. [...] Examples of this are currently available using fuel cells and flywheels.|$|E
2500|$|The C-rate is {{a measure}} of the rate at which a battery is being {{discharge}}d. It is defined as the discharge current divided by the theoretical current draw under which the battery would deliver its nominal rated capacity in one hour. A 1C discharge rate would deliver the battery's rated capacity in 1 hour. [...] A 2C discharge rate means it will discharge twice as fast (30 minutes). A 1C discharge rate on a 1.6 Ah battery means a discharge current of 1.6 A. A 2C rate would mean a discharge current of 3.2 A. Standards for rechargeable batteries generally rate the capacity over a 4-hour, 8 hour or longer discharge time. Because of internal resistance loss and the chemical processes inside the cells, a battery rarely delivers nameplate rated capacity in only one hour. Types intended for special purposes, such as in a computer <b>uninterruptible</b> power supply, may be rated by manufacturers for discharge periods much less than one hour.|$|E
2500|$|George H. Scholes Ltd. of Manchester first {{introduced}} plugs with a hollow round earth pin between rectangular current-carrying pins in 1926 under the Wylex brand name, this was {{prior to the}} first British Standard for earthed plugs. [...] The Wylex plugs were initially made in three ratings, 5A, 10A and 15A and were unpolarized (the current carrying pins {{were on the same}} centre line as the earth pin). In 1933 an asymmetric polarized version was introduced, with line pin slightly offset from the centre line. [...] In 1934 the dual plug system was introduced with the socket rated at 15A and three sizes of plug, fused 2A and 5A plugs and a 15A plug. [...] The 15A [...] "dual plug" [...] incorporated a socket with narrower apertures than a standard Wylex 15A socket, that accepted only the narrow rectangular pins of the lower-rated plugs. [...] The introduction of a 13A fused plug, rated as 3kW., enabled Scholes to propose their system as a possible solution for the new standard competing with the Dorman & Smith round pin solution, but it was not selected and the completely new BS1363 design prevailed. [...] Wylex sockets were used in council housing and public sector buildings and, for a short time in private housing. They were particularly popular in the Manchester area although they were installed throughout England, mainly in schools, university accommodation, and government laboratories. In some London schools built in the 1960s they were used as low-voltage AC sockets, typically 12V, 5A from a transformer serving one or more laboratories, for microscope lamps etc. [...] Wylex plugs and sockets continued to be manufactured for several years after BS1363 sockets became standard, and were commonly used by banks and in computer rooms during the 1960s and 1970s for <b>uninterruptible</b> power supplies or [...] "clean" [...] filtered mains supplies.|$|E
5000|$|An {{instruction}} may be <b>uninterruptible</b> {{to ensure}} its atomicity, such as when it swaps two items. A sequential processor permits interrupts between instructions, but a pipelining processor overlaps instructions, so executing an <b>uninterruptible</b> instruction renders portions of ordinary instructions <b>uninterruptible</b> too.

50|$|An <b>uninterruptible</b> power supply, also <b>uninterruptible</b> power source, UPS or battery/flywheel backup, is an {{electrical}} apparatus that provides emergency {{power to a}} load when the input power source or mains power fails. A UPS differs from an auxiliary or emergency power system or standby generator in that it will provide near-instantaneous protection from input power interruptions, by supplying energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The on-battery runtime of most <b>uninterruptible</b> power sources is relatively short (only a few minutes) but sufficient to start a standby power source or properly shut down the protected equipment.|$|E
