5000|$|For aircraft, loading {{is divided}} into two major categories: limit <b>loads</b> and <b>ultimate</b> <b>loads.</b> Limit loads are the maximum loads a {{component}} or structure may carry safely. <b>Ultimate</b> <b>loads</b> are the limit loads times a factor of 1.5 or the point beyond which the component or structure will fail. Gust loads are determined statistically and are provided by an agency such as the Federal Aviation Administration. Crash loads are loosely bounded by the ability of structures to survive the deceleration of a major ground [...] Other loads that may be critical are pressure loads (for pressurized, high-altitude aircraft) and ground loads. Loads on the ground can be from adverse braking or maneuvering during taxiing. Aircraft are constantly subjected to cyclic loading. These cyclic loads can cause metal fatigue.|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: Local {{buckling}} {{of steel}} plates reduces the <b>ultimate</b> <b>loads</b> of concrete-filled thin-walled steel box columns under axial compression. The effects of local buckling {{have not been}} considered in advanced analysis methods {{that lead to the}} overestimates of the <b>ultimate</b> <b>loads</b> of composite columns and frames. This paper presents a nonlinear fiber element analysis method for predicting the ultimate strengths and behavior of short concrete-filled thin-walled steel box columns with local buckling effects. The fiber element method considers nonlinear constitutive models for confined concrete and structural steel. Effective width formulas for steel plates with geometric imperfections and residual stresses are incorporated in the fiber element analysis program to account for local buckling effects. The progressive local and post-local buckling is simulated by gradually redistributing the normal stresses within the steel plates. Two performance indices are proposed for evaluating the section and ductility performance of concrete-filled steel box columns. The computational technique developed is used to investigate the effects of the width-to-thickness ratios and concrete compressive strengths on the ultimate strength and ductility of concrete-filled steel box columns. It is demonstrated that the nonlinear fiber element method developed predicts well the <b>ultimate</b> <b>loads</b> and behavior of concrete-filled thin-walled steel box columns and can be implemented into advanced analysis programs for the nonlinear analysis of composite frames...|$|R

40|$|Fire safety {{design of}} {{building}} structures has received greater attention {{in recent times}} due to continuing losses of properties and lives in fires. However, the structural behaviour of thin-walled cold-formed steel columns under fire conditions is not well understood despite {{the increasing use of}} light gauge steels in building construction. Cold-formed steel columns are often subject to local buckling effects. Therefore a series of laboratory tests of lipped and unlipped channel columns made of varying steel thicknesses and grades was undertaken at uniform elevated temperatures up to 700 °C under steady state conditions. Finite element models of the tested columns were also developed, and their elastic buckling and nonlinear analysis results were compared with test results at elevated temperatures. Effects of the degradation of mechanical properties of steel with temperature were included in the finite element analyses. The use of accurately measured yield stress, elasticity modulus and stress-strain curves at elevated temperatures provided a good comparison of the <b>ultimate</b> <b>loads</b> and load-deflection curves from tests and finite element analyses. The commonly used effective width design rules and the direct strength method at ambient temperature were then used to predict the <b>ultimate</b> <b>loads</b> at elevated temperatures by using the reduced mechanical properties.
