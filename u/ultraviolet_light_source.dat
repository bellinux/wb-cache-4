40|$|Fluorescent imaging {{has been}} {{traditionally}} applied to cell biology, {{and more recently}} to entomology to capture microscopic images of insect anatomy.

This study compares commercially available <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> for fluorescent photography of millipedes for the documentation of anatomical structures. Millipedes that were most strongly fluorescent were those in the order Polydesmida, and produced the brightest fluorescence that was most easily photographed using this technique.

50|$|Used in the {{measurement}} of trace amounts of volatile heavy metals such as mercury, cold vapour AFS makes use of the unique characteristic of mercury that allows vapour measurement at room temperature. Free mercury atoms in a carrier gas are excited by a collimated <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> at a wavelength of 253.7 nanometres. The excited atoms re-radiate their absorbed energy (fluoresce) at this same wavelength. Unlike the directional excitation source, the fluorescence is omnidirectional and may thus be detected using a photomultiplier tube or UV photodiode.|$|E

50|$|Returning to Boston, Coons {{continued}} {{his work on}} immunohistochemistry, in collaboration with Louis Fieser—an organic chemist—and his colleagues. Before the war, they had been successful in coupling anthracene isocyanate—a fluophore—to antipneumococcus antibodies. The resulting product retained its immunological function, and was capable of agglutinating pneumococcal bacteria. In addition, the organisms were brightly fluorescent and could be seen easily with a microscope that was fitted with an excitational <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> <b>source.</b> This basic laboratory paradigm was later applied to many antigens and antibodies, launching the clinical disciplines of diagnostic immunofluorescence microscopy for bacteriology and immunology, immunocytology, and immunohistochemistry in anatomic pathology. These methods are widely used today, globally, in clinical medicine and cell biology.|$|E
40|$|Light traps {{have been}} used widely to sample insect {{abundance}} and diversity, but their performance for sampling scarab beetles in tropical forests based on <b>light</b> <b>source</b> type and sampling hours throughout the night has not been evaluated. The efficiency of mercury-vapour lamps, cool white <b>light</b> and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> in attracting Dynastinae, Melolonthinae and Rutelinae scarab beetles, and the most adequate period {{of the night to}} carry out the sampling was tested in different forest areas of Costa Rica. Our results showed that <b>light</b> <b>source</b> wavelengths and hours of sampling influenced scarab beetle catches. No significant differences were observed in trap performance between the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> and mercury-vapour traps, whereas these two methods caught significantly more species richness and abundance than cool white light traps. Species composition also varied between methods. Large differences appear between catches in the sampling period, with the first five hours of the night being more effective than the last five hours. Because of their high efficiency and logistic advantages, we recommend <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> traps deployed during the first hours of the night as the best sampling method for biodiversity studies of those scarab beetles in tropical forests...|$|R

We report on the design and analysis of AlGaN-based light-emitting diodes with an emission wavelength near 280 nm. Internal device physics is investigated by three-dimensional numerical simulation. The simulation incorporates a drift-diffusion model for the carrier transport, built-in polarization, the wurtzite energy band-structure of strained quantum wells, as well as radiative and nonradiative carrier recombination. Critical material parameters are identified and their impact on the simulation results is investigated. Limitations of the internal quantum efficiency by electron leakage and nonradiative recombination are analyzed. Increasing the stopper layer bandgap is predicted to improve the quantum efficiency and the light output of our LED substantially...|$|R
50|$|Tomato hornworms {{are known}} to eat various plants from the family Solanaceae, {{commonly}} feeding on tomato, eggplant, pepper, tobacco, moonflowers and potato. Accordingly, they are often found on defoliated tomato plants, the caterpillar clinging to the underside of a branch near the trunk. They are difficult to spot due to their green coloration. Tomato hornworms fluoresce differently from tomato leaves. Using an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> of 375 nm and viewed behind a blue-blocking filter (yellow or amber filter), a tomato hornworm fluoresces in bright green while a tomato leaf appears deep red/amber. This sharp color contrast helps gardeners locate tomato hornworms at night. They can be reduced by planting marigold flowers around these plants.|$|E
50|$|An EPROM (rarely EROM), or {{erasable}} programmable read-only memory, {{is a type}} {{of memory}} chip that retains its data when its power supply is switched off. Computer memory that can retrieve stored data after a power supply has been turned off and back on is called non-volatile. It is an array of floating-gate transistors individually programmed by an electronic device that supplies higher voltages than those normally used in digital circuits. Once programmed, an EPROM can be erased by exposing it to strong <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> (such as from a mercury-vapor light). EPROMs are easily recognizable by the transparent fused quartz window {{in the top of the}} package, through which the silicon chip is visible, and which permits exposure to ultraviolet light during erasing.|$|E
5000|$|Green {{fluorescent}} protein (GFP) {{is also a}} photoprotein {{isolated and}} cloned from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria.

All that is required is an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> to activate the fluorescent properties of the photoprotein. This ability to autofluoresce makes GFP highly desirable in biosensing assays since {{it can be used}} on-line and in to monitor intact, living cells. Additionally, the ability to alter GFP to produce light emissions besides blue (i.e., cyan, red, and yellow) allows it {{to be used as a}} multianalyte detector. Consequently, GFP has been used extensively in bioreporter constructs within bacterial, yeast, nematode, plant, and mammalian hosts.|$|E

50|$|Brehm and von Puttkammer {{published}} the first PEPICO study on methane in 1967. In the early works, a fixed energy <b>light</b> <b>source</b> was used, and the electron detection {{was carried out}} using retarding grids or : the mass spectra were recorded {{as a function of}} electron energy. Tunable vacuum <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> have been used in later setups, in which fixed, mostly zero kinetic energy electrons are detected, and the mass spectra are recorded as a function of photon energy. Detecting zero kinetic energy or threshold electrons in threshold photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy, TPEPICO, has two major advantages. Firstly, no kinetic energy electrons are produced in energy ranges with poor Franck-Condon factors in the photoelectron spectrum, but threshold electrons can still be emitted via other ionization mechanisms. Second, threshold electrons are stationary and can be detected with higher collection efficiencies, thereby increasing signal levels.|$|R
