40|$|Using a two-country {{macroeconomic}} {{model of}} labor migration, we investigate {{the effects of}} minimum wages on the inflow of <b>unskilled</b> foreign <b>workers</b> under the firm's preferential hiring of <b>unskilled</b> native <b>workers.</b> We assume that both countries' <b>workers</b> are <b>unskilled,</b> and each country has a single labor market where unskilled labor is traded. We also assume that workers move from a country of lower expected real-consumption wages (nominal wages divided by {{the consumer price index}} and multiplied by the probability of employment) to a country of higher wages. We show that the home country faced with the inflow of <b>unskilled</b> foreign <b>workers</b> can reduce it by raising its minimum wages without making <b>unskilled</b> native <b>worker</b> employment smaller. Increases in minimum wages lead to the lower employment probability of immigrant foreign workers, making their expected real-consumption wages at the home country relatively lower to those in the foreign country. We also show that the sum of <b>unskilled</b> native <b>worker</b> real-consumption wages is likely to increase with increases in minimum wages. This results from the fact that <b>unskilled</b> native <b>workers</b> are fully employed as long as increases in minimum wages are limited. Our results suggest that under the realistic assumption of the firm's preferential hiring of <b>unskilled</b> native <b>workers,</b> minimum wages not only reduce the inflow of <b>unskilled</b> foreign <b>workers,</b> but also improve the welfare of <b>unskilled</b> native <b>workers...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1942, {{after the}} death of Armaments Minister Fritz Todt, Hitler {{appointed}} Albert Speer as his replacement. Speer improved production via streamlined organisation, the use of single-purpose machines operated by <b>unskilled</b> <b>workers,</b> rationalisation of production methods and better co-ordination between the many different firms that made tens of thousands of components. Factories were relocated away from rail yards, which were bombing targets. By 1944, the war was consuming 75 percent of Germany's gross domestic product, compared to 60 percent in the Soviet Union and 55 percent in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The prosperous {{industry}} {{which had}} sprung {{up around the}} new iron industry required vast numbers of largely <b>unskilled</b> <b>workers</b> to mine ironstone {{and work in the}} blast furnace plants. Coatbridge therefore became a popular destination for vast numbers of Irish (especially from County Donegal in Ulster) arriving in Scotland. The iron bars and plates produced in Coatbridge iron works were the raw materials needed throughout the British Empire for railways, construction, bridge building and shipbuilding. One example of uses Coatbridge' iron was put to included armour plating for British ships fighting in the Crimean War.|$|E
5|$|Saudi Arabia {{was one of}} {{the poorest}} and most undeveloped {{countries}} in the world when oil was discovered in the late 1930s. The country therefore needed foreign expertise and labour to exploit its vast oil reserves. As a result, in the years after World War II there was a growth in the numbers of foreign technical, professional and administrative personnel, mainly from other Middle Eastern countries but also supplied by Western oil companies, many of whom worked for ARAMCO (Arabian-American Oil Company). A much greater increase in the numbers of foreign workers came with the oil-price boom following the 1973 oil crisis. Infrastructure and development plans led to an influx of skilled and <b>unskilled</b> <b>workers,</b> principally Palestinians, Egyptians, Yemenis and others from Arab countries, but also Indians and Pakistanis, leading to a doubling of the Saudi population by 1985. Beginning in the early 1980s, South and East Asian countries, such as Thailand, Philippines and South Korea, increasingly provided migrant workers.|$|E

40|$|Using a small open {{economic}} model, I {{investigate the}} effects of changes in unskilled foreign workers' accessibility to the labor market on their inflow into a small open economy and their participation to the labor market. I assume that legal and illegal <b>unskilled</b> foreign <b>workers</b> move between a small open economy {{and the rest of}} the world due to difference in real-consumption wages (nominal wages divided by the consumer price index). However, even if <b>unskilled</b> foreign <b>workers</b> migrate to a small open economy, only a few of them can enter the labor market because of the impediments to <b>unskilled</b> foreign <b>workers</b> participation to the labor market. I show that the inflow of <b>unskilled</b> foreign <b>workers</b> into a small open economy depends on their accessibility to the labor market and it becomes smaller as <b>unskilled</b> foreign <b>workers</b> have more access to the labor market. I also show that the policy authority's utility increases (decreases) as <b>unskilled</b> foreign <b>workers</b> have more access to the labor market, if the ratio of legal <b>unskilled</b> foreign <b>workers</b> is high (low) and unskilled foreign workers' accessibility to the labor market is low (high) ...|$|R
40|$|Assuming a small {{open economy}} where wages are {{determined}} by the efficiency wage hypothesis and the labor market has a dual structure, we investigate how changes in the <b>unskilled</b> foreign <b>worker</b> quota affect skilled and <b>unskilled</b> native <b>workers.</b> For this purpose, we assume that the <b>unskilled</b> foreign <b>worker</b> quota is smaller than the number of workers who are willing to migrate to a small open economy. We also assume that the labor of the skilled native workers is supplied in the primary labor market and that of the unskilled native and foreign workers is supplied in the secondary labor market. We show that increases in the <b>unskilled</b> foreign <b>worker</b> quota augment the skilled native worker employment and wages and decrease those of the <b>unskilled</b> native <b>workers.</b> We also show that the expected lifetime utility of the individual employed and unemployed skilled native workers and the sum of all the skilled native workers' expected lifetime utilities increase with an increase in the quota; however, the effects of increases in the quota on the expected lifetime utility of individual employed and unemployed <b>unskilled</b> native <b>workers</b> and the sum of all the unskilled native workers' expected lifetime utilities are ambiguous. Our results imply that increases in the <b>unskilled</b> foreign <b>worker</b> quota have positive effects on the skilled native workers, whereas their effects on the <b>unskilled</b> native <b>workers</b> are not necessarily positive...|$|R
5|$|Water-power {{was first}} {{introduced}} to England by John Lombe at his silk mill in Derby in 1719, but it was Richard Arkwright who applied water-power {{to the process of}} producing cotton in the 1770s. His patent of a water frame allowed cotton to be spun continuously, meaning it could be produced by <b>unskilled</b> <b>workers.</b> Cromford Mill was the site of Arkwright's first mill, with nearby Cromford village significantly expanded for his then-new workforce; this system of production and workers' housing was copied throughout the valley. To ensure the presence of a labour force, it was necessary to construct housing for the mill workers. Thus, new settlements were established by mill owners around the mills– sometimes developing a pre-existing community– with their own amenities such as schools, chapels, and markets. Most of the housing still exists and is still in use. Along with the transport infrastructure form part of the site. A transport infrastructure was built to open new markets for the mills' produce.|$|E
5|$|At first, the laborers {{walked the}} seven {{kilometers}} from Auschwitz I {{to the plant}} each day, but as this meant they had to rise at 03:00, many arrived exhausted and unable to work. The camp at Monowitz (also called Monowitz-Buna or Auschwitz III) was constructed and began housing inmates on 30 October 1942, the first concentration camp to be financed and built by private industry. In January 1943 the ArbeitsausbildungLager (labor education camp) was moved from the parent camp to Monowitz. These prisoners were also forced {{to work on the}} building site. The SS charged IG Farben three Reichsmarks per hour for <b>unskilled</b> <b>workers,</b> four for skilled workers. Although the camp administrators expected the prisoners to work at 75 percent of the capacity of a free worker, the inmates were only able to perform 20 to 50 percent as well. Site managers constantly threatened inmates with transportation to Birkenau for death in the gas chambers as a way to try to increase productivity. Deaths and transfers to the gas chambers at Birkenau reduced the prisoner population of Monowitz by nearly a fifth each month; numbers were made up with new arrivals. Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. Though the factory had been expected to begin production in 1943, shortages of labor and raw materials meant start-up had to be postponed repeatedly. The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to Marx, economists {{noted that}} the problem with using the [...] "quantity of labour" [...] to {{establish}} the value of commodities was that the time spent by an <b>unskilled</b> <b>worker</b> would be longer than the time spent on the same commodity by a skilled worker.

40|$|To analyse {{the demand}} for unskilled and {{semi-skilled}} labour from 1993 till 1997, this article uses data of the IAB’s new Linked Employer-Employee data set (LIAB), which combines the IAB establishment panel with the historic data file of the employment statistics. The <b>unskilled</b> and semi-skilled <b>workers</b> are identified according to a job-oriented concept. The analyses confirm the postulated relationship between technological progress (as measured by the technical state of the equipment {{as well as by}} investment in IT) and a smaller proportion of <b>unskilled</b> and semi-skilled <b>workers</b> in companies. In contrast, a negative correlation between international interdependence (approximated by the export quota) and {{the demand for}} <b>unskilled</b> and semi-skilled <b>workers</b> could only partly be ascertained. Cross-sectional as well as longitudinal regressions show a negative relationship between the proportion of <b>unskilled</b> and semi-skilled <b>workers</b> in an establishment and the establishment’s average wage for <b>unskilled</b> and semi-skilled <b>workers.</b> For example, the estimated parameter from an OLS estimate implies that companies with a five per cent lower average wage for <b>unskilled</b> and semi-skilled <b>workers</b> have a one per cent higher proportion of <b>unskilled</b> and semi-skilled <b>workers</b> in their overall workforce. This therefore supports the thesis {{that one of the reasons}} for the increase in the unemployment rate of <b>unskilled</b> and semi-skilled <b>workers</b> is a too rigid wage structure which does not balance out the demand problems of <b>unskilled</b> and semi-skilled <b>workers</b> caused by technological progress.
