These developments led to advances in the field of evolutionary developmental biology towards <b>understanding</b> <b>how</b> the various body plans of the animal phyla have evolved and how they are related to one another.|$|E

He believed that metal was the first indispensable article of commerce, and that metal-smiths were therefore full-time professionals who lived off the social surplus. Within a matter of years he had followed this up {{with a string of}} further works: The Forest Cultures of Northern Europe: A Study in Evolution and Diffusion (1931) and The Continental Affinities of British Neolithic Pottery (1932).|$|E

Century magazine offered Grant a book contract with a 10 percent royalty, but Grant's friend Mark Twain, <b>understanding</b> <b>how</b> bad Grant's financial condition was, made him an offer for his memoirs which paid an unheard-of 75 percent royalty. To provide for his family, Grant worked intensely on his memoirs at his home in New York City. His former staff member Adam Badeau assisted him with much of the research, while his son Frederick located documents and did much of the fact-checking. Because of the summer heat and humidity, his doctors recommended that he move upstate to a cottage at the top of Mount McGregor, offered by a family friend.|$|E

5|$|Kristen LaMoreaux, {{another student}} of the University of Pittsburgh, focused on the {{emplacement}} of trachyte lava flows and domes. In 2006, LaMoreaux analyzed jointing patterns at Ornostay Bluff, a viscous series of trachyte lava flows on the western lava plateau of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. LaMoreaux also examined trachytic lava flows from Koosick Bluff and Triangle Dome, a trachytic lava dome which last erupted during the Pleistocene period. Other studies by LaMoreaux determined criteria for <b>understanding</b> <b>how</b> lava flow thickness {{may or may not}} be an indication that the progress of a lava flow was impeded by an ice barrier, resulting in an unusually thick lava flow.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{research}} into the properties of neptunium since then {{has been focused on}} <b>understanding</b> <b>how</b> to confine it as a portion of nuclear waste. Because it has isotopes with very long half-lives, it is of particular concern in the context of designing confinement facilities that can last for thousands of years. It has found some limited uses as a radioactive tracer and a precursor for various nuclear reactions to produce useful plutonium isotopes. However, most of the neptunium that is produced as a reaction byproduct in nuclear power stations {{is considered to be a}} waste product.|$|E
5|$|Under Weinberg's {{tenure as}} director, ORNL's Biology Division grew {{to five times}} the size of the next largest {{division}}. This division was charged with <b>understanding</b> <b>how</b> ionizing radiation interacts with living things and to try to find ways to help them survive radiation damage, such as bone marrow transplants. In the 1960s Weinberg also pursued new missions for ORNL, such as using nuclear energy to desalinate seawater. He recruited Philip Hammond from the Los Alamos National Laboratory to further this mission and in 1970 started the first big ecology project in the United States: the National Science Foundation— Research Applied to National Needs Environmental Program.|$|E

5|$|As the environments of most {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} changing, {{the reactions of}} metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for <b>understanding</b> <b>how</b> metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have {{little effect on the}} flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.|$|E
