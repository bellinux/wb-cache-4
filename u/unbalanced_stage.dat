40|$|Asynchronous {{circuits}} have {{a number}} of performance advantages over their synchronous equivalents, yet these advantages are rarely realised due to an overhead in the asynchronous design method. This paper investigates the nature of this overhead and proposes a new approach to overcome its effect. The method is then demonstrated on a processor design. The process demonstrates the ability of the method to implement: register locking, instruction reordering, super-scaling, hyper-threading, cache-banking and other complex techniques, easily and often without any effort from the designer. 1 Asynchronous Circuit Performance Progress in single threaded performance of modern processors is becoming stagnant due to the design complexity of very large scale systems, the design challenges presented by globally distributed clock nets and increasing variation in component delays. Asynchronous circuits have the potential of achieving substantially higher performance targets than synchronous equivalents. Most advantages have been demonstrated and exploited [1][2][3][4], yet these fail to yield the expected performance boost. 1. 1 Advantages The advantages of asynchronous circuits can be broken down into two groups, those brought in by using local delays rather than a global clock and those achieved by using implicit timing when computing (shown in figure 1). The clock overheads consists of <b>unbalanced</b> <b>stages</b> and clock skew. Although <b>unbalanced</b> <b>stages</b> can cause a degradation in performance in synchronous systems by running at the speed of the slowest stage, the bundled data approach does not automatically solve this problem as the bundled data design will still have the critical cycle time equal to the slowest executed stage. So design effort is still required to lessen this effect and it will never be fully removed by selectively executing/bypassing stages. Matched delay overhead is a much greater component of the clock overheads. These generally cannot be overcome by using bundled data approaches, (although data dependant delays can alleviate some of the worst-average delay effect). The basis of these overheads is the worst-case delay assumptions made by estimating the delay of a computational stage. The worst case delay is calculate...|$|R
25|$|If a {{regulator}} stage has {{an architecture}} that compensates {{for a change}} of upstream pressure on the moving parts of the valve so that a change in supply pressure does not affect the force required to open the valve, the stage is described as balanced. Upstream and downstream valves, first and second stages, and diaphragm and piston operation can be balanced or unbalanced, and a full description of a stage will specify which of all of these options apply. For example a regulator may have a balanced piston first stage with a balanced downstream second stage. Both balanced and <b>unbalanced</b> piston first <b>stages</b> are fairly common, but most diaphragm first stages are balanced. Balancing the first stage has a greater overall affect on thr performance of a regulator, as the variation in supply pressure from the cylinder is much greater than the variation in interstage pressure, even with an <b>unbalanced</b> first <b>stage.</b> However the second stage operates on very a small pressure differential and is more sensitive to variations in supply pressure. Most top range regulators have at least one balanced stage, {{but it is not clear}} that balancing both stages makes a noticeable difference to performance.|$|R
40|$|Multiprocessors on a chip are {{the reality}} of these days. Semiconductor {{industry}} has recognized this approach as the most efficient in order to exploit chip resources, but {{the success of this}} paradigm heavily relies on the efficiency and widespread diffusion of parallel software. Among the many techniques to express the parallelism of applications, this paper focuses on pipelining, a technique well suited to data-intensive multimedia applications. We introduce a prototyping platform (FPGA-based) and a methodology for these applications. Our platform consists of a mix of standard and custom heterogeneous cores. We discuss several case studies, analyzing the interaction of the architecture and applications and we show that multimedia and telecommunication applications with <b>unbalanced</b> pipeline <b>stages</b> can be easily deployed. Our framework eases the development cycle and enables the developers to focus directly on the problems posed by the programming model {{in the direction of the}} implementation of a production system...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} design of a {{low-power}} 4 -bit 1 GS/s folding-flash ADC with a folding factor of two. The design of a new unbalanced double-tail dynamic comparator affords an ultra-low power operation and a high dynamic range. Unlike the conventional approaches, this design uses a fully matched input <b>stage,</b> an <b>unbalanced</b> latch <b>stage,</b> and a two-clock operation scheme. A combination of these features yields significant reduction of the kick-back noise, while allowing the design flexibility for adjusting the trip points of the comparators. As a result, the ADC achieves SNDR of 22. 3 dB at 100 MHz and 21. 8 dB at 500 MHz (i. e. the Nyquist frequency). The maximum INL and DNL are about 0. 2 LSB. The converter consumes about 700 uW from a 1 -V supply yielding a figure of merit of 65 fJ/conversion step. These attributes make the proposed folding-flash ADC attractive for the next-generation wireless applications.

50|$|Eldred's {{company was}} called Breathing Appliances Pty Ltd and located at 70 Abbotsford St., North Melbourne. His {{marketing}} {{was done by}} his friend Bob Wallace-Mitchell. It was difficult for Wallace-Mitchell to market in those early days, as compressed air was not readily available. His first task was to locate a compressor with a sales point {{in each of the}} Australian capital cities. Once this was done, dealers could stock his SCUBA and refill the cylinders. In 1954 Eldred also created the Porpoise Universal, which had a high supply rate of over 300 liters per minute. The Universal used the same demand valve and was modular in design. The reduction valve was a balanced diaphragm type, which was modified to become a piston type. It became his flagship model. Eldred also made a cheaper model, called the Sportsman. The Sportsman was a very compact regulator with innovative features now found on regulators of today. It was made of plastic and had an <b>unbalanced</b> first <b>stage.</b> Market needs made this model necessary, but Eldred did not like it.|$|R
40|$|Segments of EEG {{recorded}} {{during sleep}} and anesthesia are classified by evolutionary optimized populations of neural networks, adapted fuzzy rules and support vector machines. Most {{of the features}} extracted from the frontal EEG contribute to {{the separation of the}} different stages of both sleep and anesthesia. Neurophysiological research supports the idea to regard sleep and anaesthesia classification from a common point of view. According to the <b>unbalanced</b> number of <b>stage</b> specific EEG segments the concordance between expert scoring and automatically generated classification had to be evaluated by a set of criteria. The training of the networks and the adaptation of the fuzzy rules was controlled by multi criteria optimization. The results presented by confusion matrices let us conclude that the optimized populations of neural networks are more robust to the inter-individual differences than the adapted fuzzy rules. But on the other hand the fuzzy rules can be compared with the rules used by the expert in a more direct way and they can serve the improvement of visual scoring too. Approaches of support vector machines showed the highest efficiencies in the non-linear separation of two classes. The results are used to implement the classifiers in embedded systems which perform an efficient sleep diagnosis and support the anesthesiologist in controlling the drug administration...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} multi-message private information retrieval (MPIR) from N non-communicating replicated databases. In MPIR, the user is interested in retrieving P messages out of M stored messages without leaking {{the identity of the}} retrieved messages. The information-theoretic sum capacity of MPIR C_s^P is the maximum number of desired message symbols that can be retrieved privately per downloaded symbol. For the case P ≥M/ 2, we determine the exact sum capacity of MPIR as C_s^P= 1 / 1 +M-P/PN. The achievable scheme in this case is based on downloading MDS-coded mixtures of all messages. For P ≤M/ 2, we develop lower and upper bounds for all M,P,N. These bounds match if the total number of messages M is an integer multiple of the number of desired messages P, i. e., M/P∈N. In this case, C_s^P= 1 - 1 /N/ 1 -(1 /N) ^M/P. The achievable scheme in this case generalizes the single-message capacity achieving scheme to have <b>unbalanced</b> number of <b>stages</b> per round of download. For all the remaining cases, the difference between the lower and upper bound is at most 0. 0082, which occurs for M= 5, P= 2, N= 2. Our results indicate that joint retrieval of desired messages is more efficient than successive use of single-message retrieval schemes.

40|$|Epidermal {{homeostasis}} {{is understood}} as the maintenance of epidermal tissue structure and function by a fine tuned regulatory mechanism balancing proliferation and cell loss by desquamation and apoptosis. The lack of appropriate experimental models has largely prevented {{a better understanding of}} the regulatory mechanisms controlling epidermal tissue homeostasis in human skin. Keratinocyte culture studies had revealed a strict dependency of regular epidermal differentiation on dermal interactions only accomplishable in three-dimensional skin models. As major drawbacks, conventional models, employing collagen hydrogels as dermal equivalents (DEs) exhibit a rather poor stability and limited lifespan. Here, we present an improved stabilized in vitro-model for long-term growth and differentiation of keratinocytes providing the basis for tissue homeostasis. Keratinocytes were grown on DEs reinforced by modified hyaluronic acid fibers (Hyalograft- 3 D) and colonized with skin fibroblasts, producing genuine dermis-type matrix. These skin equivalents (SEs) develop superior epidermal architecture with regular differentiation and ultrastructure. Critical aspects of differentiation, still <b>unbalanced</b> in early <b>stages,</b> are renormalized, most strikingly the coexpression of keratins K 1 /K 10, downregulation of regeneration-associated keratins (K 16), and restriction of K 15 to the basal layer. The strict localization of integrins to basal cells underlining restored tissue polarity, the drop of keratinocyte growth rates towards physiological levels and the rapid formation of a mature basement membrane with abundant anchoring fibrils are altogether features fulfilling the criteria of tissue homeostasis. Therefore, these scaffold-based SEs not only allow for studying homeostasis control but also for the first time provide proper experimental conditions for establishing a stem cell niche in vitro...|$|R
