40|$|PURPOSE: Harms of {{prostate}} cancer treatment on urinary health related quality of life have been thoroughly studied. In this study we evaluated not only the harms but also the potential benefits {{of prostate}} cancer treatment in relieving the pretreatment <b>urinary</b> <b>symptom</b> burden. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In American (1, 021) and Spanish (539) multicenter prospective cohorts of men with localized prostate cancer we evaluated the effects of radical prostatectomy, external radiotherapy or brachytherapy in relieving pretreatment urinary symptoms and in inducing urinary symptoms de novo, measured by changes in urinary medication use and patient reported urinary bother. RESULTS: <b>Urinary</b> <b>symptom</b> burden improved in 23 % and worsened in 28 % of subjects after prostate cancer treatment in the American cohort. Urinary medication use rates before treatment and 2 years after treatment were 15 % and 6 % with radical prostatectomy, 22 % and 26 % with external radiotherapy, and 19 % and 46 % with brachytherapy, respectively. Pretreatment urinary medication use (OR 1. 4, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 2. 0, p = 0. 04) and pretreatment moderate lower urinary tract symptoms (OR 2. 8, 95 % CI 2. 2 - 3. 6) predicted prostate cancer treatment associated relief of baseline <b>urinary</b> <b>symptom</b> burden. Subjects with pretreatment lower urinary tract symptoms who underwent radical prostatectomy experienced the greatest relief of pretreatment symptoms (OR 4. 3, 95 % CI 3. 0 - 6. 1), despite the development of deleterious de novo urinary incontinence in some men. The magnitude of pretreatment <b>urinary</b> <b>symptom</b> burden and beneficial effect of cancer treatment on those symptoms were verified in the Spanish cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Men with pretreatment lower urinary tract symptoms may experience benefit rather than harm in overall urinary outcome from primary prostate cancer treatment. Practitioners should consider the full spectrum of <b>urinary</b> <b>symptom</b> burden evident before prostate cancer treatment in treatment decisions.

Several {{attempts have been}} reported to minimize these symptoms. Objective: To compare Tolterodine, Tamsulosin, and placebo effects on double J stent–related symptoms. Material and method: In all, 125 patients (82 males and 43 females) with double J stent were randomly divided into three groups (group 1, n: 42, group 2, n: 40 and group 3, n: 43). Each patient randomly received one pack of drug in different colors by a nurse unaware of the content to take Tamsulosin 0. 4 [*]mg before sleep (MODALUSINE), Tolterodine 2 [*]mg twice a day or placebo once daily (capsules filled with starch) : group 1 received placebo, group 2 Tamsulosin and group 3 Tolterodine for 1 [*]month in a double-blind manner. Ureteral stent-related morbidity indices which analyzed include <b>urinary</b> <b>symptom,</b> pain, general health, quality of work and sex scores. All of indices measured by Ureteral Symptom Score Questionnaire for first and fourth weeks after drug consumption and the first week after double J stent removal (labeled as w 1, w 4, and w 5, respectively). Result: The mean age was 44. 8 [*]years (range: 15 – 83 [*]years). There was no statistically significant difference in background characteristics between groups (p value[*]>[*] 0. 05).

40|$|What's {{known on}} the subject? and What does the study add? Case series have {{described}} lower <b>urinary</b> tract <b>symptoms</b> associated with ketamine use including severe pain, frequency, haematuria and dysuria. Little is known regarding {{the frequency of}} symptoms, relationship of symptoms with dose and frequency of use and natural history of symptoms once the ketamine user has stopped. This study describes the prevalence of ketamine use in a population of recreational drug users in a dance music setting. It shows a dose-frequency relationship with ketamine use. It shows that <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> associated with recreational ketamine use {{may lead to a}} considerable demand on health resources in the primary-, secondary- and emergency-care settings. It shows that symptoms may improve once ketamine use is decreased. OBJECTIVE To investigate the prevalence and natural history of <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> in a cohort of recreational ketamine users. PATIENTS AND METHODS A purposeful sampling technique was used. Between November 2009 and January 2010 participants were invited to undertake an on-line questionnaire promoted by a national dance music magazine and website. Data regarding demographics and illicit drug-use were collected. Among respondents reporting recent ketamine use, additional information detailing their ketamine use, experience of <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> and use of related healthcare services was obtained. RESULTS In all, 3806 surveys were completed, of which 1285 (33. 8 %) participants reported ketamine use within the last year. Of the ketamine users, 17 % were found to be dependent on the drug; 26. 6 % (340) of recent ketamine users reported experiencing <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms.</b> <b>Urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> were significantly related to both dose of ketamine used and frequency of ketamine use. Of 251 users reporting their experience of symptoms over time in relationship to their use of ketamine, 51 % reported improvement in <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> upon cessation of use with only eight (3. 8 %) reporting deterioration after stopping use. CONCLUSIONS <b>Urinary</b> tract <b>symptoms</b> are reported in over a quarter of regular ketamine users. A dose and frequency response relationship has been shown between ketamine use and <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Both users and primary-care providers need to be educated about <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> that may arise in ketamine users.

However, it can cause adverse effects, such as voiding dysfunction. The risk of voiding dysfunction remains uncertain in patients without subjective voiding problems. Methodology: We prospectively enrolled patients with nasal congestion who required treatment with pseudoephedrine from May to August 2015. All patients denied concomitant subjective voiding problem. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire {{was used to evaluate}} voiding function before and 1 week after the pseudoephedrine treatment.

METHODS: a cross-sectional analysis was conducted on women from an out patient clinic in São Paulo state, Brazil, 60 days after delivery. Pelvic floor muscle function was assessed by surface electromyography (basal tone, maximal voluntary contraction and mean sustained contraction) and by a manual muscle test (grades 0 - 5). In an interview, the <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> were identified and women with difficulty to understand, with motor/neurological impairment, pelvic surgery, diabetes, restriction for vaginal palpation and practicing exercises forpelvic floor muscles were excluded. The χ 2 and Fisher Exact test were used to compare proportions and the Mann-Whitney {{test was used to}} analyze mean differences. RESULTS: 46 primiparous were assessed on average 63. 7 days postpartum. The most prevalent symptoms were nocturia (19. 6 %), urgency (13 %) and increased daytime urinary frequency (8. 7 %). Obese and overweight women had 4. 6 times more of these symptoms (PR= 4. 6 [95 %CI; 1. 2 - 18. 6; p value= 0. 0194]). Stress urinary incontinence was the most prevalent incontinence (6. 5 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND. The Stirling benign prostatic {{hyperplasia}} {{natural history}} group have previously reported a prevalence of this condition of 255 per 1000 in a community study of 1610 men aged 40 - 79 years. AIM. It was decided to examine the consultation patterns of men with {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} in greater detail. METHOD. All participating men were invited to complete a previously validated lifestyle questionnaire including questions on consultations with their general practitioner {{during the previous year}} and previous history of prostatic problems. The men who had a <b>urinary</b> <b>symptom</b> score greater than 11, or who had a urinary flow rate of less than 15 ml per second were examined by transurethral ultrasonography for prostate size. RESULTS. Of 364 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, 89 % had not consulted their doctor about urinary symptoms in the year prior to the study. Men with moderate to severe urinary symptoms were six {{times more likely to have}} consulted their doctor than those with mild symptoms. Moderate to severe symptoms and greater interference with daily living activities were both associated with a greater likelihood of consultation, independent of age. Of all the men in the study referred to the specialist clinic for assessment of prostate size by transurethral ultrasonography, two thirds were referred because of low urinary flow rate and one third because of high <b>urinary</b> <b>symptom</b> scores. The reported consultation data showed a reverse ratio of one third of those consulting having a low urinary flow rate and approximately two thirds having urinary symptoms. CONCLUSION. While mass screening is unjustified, there is a need for patient education about benign prostatic hyperplasia in general and the recognition of declining strength of urinary flow as a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia and not of ageing alone. Furthermore, evaluation of primary care use of urinary flowmeters and the development of local protocols are suggested as elements of a case finding strategy for benign prostatic hyperplasia based on patient led consultation...|$|E

The objectives were to estimate {{the prevalence of}} <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms,</b> faecal incontinence and their impact on the lives of stroke survivors and carers.;Methods: Postal questionnaires and home interviews and administered to assess the prevalence and impact of <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms,</b> and faecal incontinence in a stroke population. Qualitative interviews explored the impact that urinary incontinence can have on carers.;Results: Thirty-three percent of stroke survivors reported urinary incontinence compared with 14 % of the non-stroke population (p< 0. 0001). After age and sex were controlled for, the difference in prevalence remained significant. Twice as many stroke survivors felt that their <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> were a moderate to severe problem (p< 0. 0001). Stroke and urinary incontinence were independently associated with anxiety, depression and had a negative effect on quality of life. It was the severity of <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> that was associated with this impact. Faecal incontinence was reported in 7. 4 % of survivors compared with 2. 9 % of the non-stroke group (p< 0. 0001) and the prevalence of double incontinence (faecal and urinary) was more than four times higher amongst stroke survivors (p< 0. 001).

Ninety-six percent had POP-Q stages I or II. Only obstructive urinary symptoms and feeling a bulge were associated with vaginal descensus. Obstructive <b>urinary</b> <b>symptom</b> scores increased as anterior (P =. 04), posterior (P 3 ̆c. 01), and maximal (P =. 01) vaginal descensus increased. Urinary incontinence or bowel symptoms were not associated with descensus of any vaginal compartment. 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 See or feel a bulge, 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 reported by 11 women (4...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about why men fail to seek medical help for urological symptoms. AIM: This study was {{designed}} to document men's perceptions of <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> and to increase understanding of health-care-seeking behaviour. METHOD: A stratified random sample of men aged 40 - 79 years was drawn from the age-sex register of a health centre in Central Scotland. Two hundred men were interviewed using semi-structured qualitative techniques and asked to complete a symptom questionnaire. The response rate was 65 %. RESULTS: <b>Urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> reported to be most bothersome were dribbling, hesitancy and straining. All but the youngest age group (40 - 49 years) associated developing <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> with ageing. This was considered to be a reason not to consult a doctor. Most symptoms were not thought to be serious. Pain, haematuria and acute retention gave cause for concern, and were perceived as reasons for seeking medical help. Although <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> interfered with selected activities in daily life, this was not a worry to the men and was not seen to be a sufficient reason alone to consult their general practitioner. CONCLUSION: The insidious development of urinary problems over time reinforces the belief that it is part of getting older and accounts for the accommodation of symptoms within men's everyday living experiences. Bothersomeness associated with <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> was not synonymous with worry or problems. Doctors must be prepared to initiate discussion about urinary function in order {{to assess the impact of}} symptoms on an individual's daily life...|$|R
40|$|The aim was {{to compare}} <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> and their {{influence}} on daily life among elderly (75 +) {{women and men in}} a sample that previously had reported difficulties controlling urine (urine incontinence (UI)) and/or other <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> (OU). A further {{aim was to}} find underlying structures of <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> and to identify symptoms that had an impact on seeking medical help and need of help in daily activities (dependency). In total, 771 persons (352 men and 419 women) over 75 years answered a questionnaire, addressed to those (n = 1881) who in a previous population-based study had reported having symptoms of UI and/or OU using the Bristol Female Lower <b>Urinary</b> Tract <b>Symptoms</b> (BF-LUTS) questionnaire and International Continence Society male (ICSmale) questionnaire. The groups with UI, OU, women and men reported similar symptoms of frequency, day and night, as well as influence on social life, and avoidance of places and situations due to the <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> although they differed in storage and voiding symptoms. Feeling incomplete emptying of bladder differed between the UI, OU, and mixed symptoms (MS) groups but not between genders. Of the whole sample, 43. 3 % had sought medical help. Factor analysis of similar questions in BF-LUTS and ICSmale questionnaire resulted in the factors labeled voiding, storage, pain, frequency, and daily life. Predictors of the <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> for needing help in daily activities were frequent micturition day and night (OR 3. 2) when aged was controlled for. Influence on daily life (OR 2. 5), storage symptoms (OR 2. 2), and pain symptoms (OR 2. 1) predicted seeking medical help. The results show that <b>urinary</b> <b>symptoms</b> are equally bothersome among men and women. There is a need to encourage elderly to seek medical help and to obtain treatment or alleviations for symptoms that give most bother and indicate dependency, such as frequent micturition day and night and difficulties to reach the toilet in time without leakage...|$|R
