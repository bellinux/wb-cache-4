I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

500|$|In 1983 and 1984, Crass {{were part}} of the Stop the City actions co-ordinated by London Greenpeace which foreshadowed the {{anti-globalisation}} rallies of the early 21st century. Support for these activities was provided in the lyrics and sleeve notes of the band's last single, [...] "You're Already Dead", expressing doubts about their commitment to non-violence. It was also a reflection of disagreements within the group, as explained by Rimbaud; [...] "Half the band supported the pacifist line and half supported direct and if necessary violent action. It was a confusing time for <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think a lot of our records show that, inadvertently". This led to introspection within the band, with some members becoming embittered and losing sight of their essentially positive stance. Reflecting this debate, the next release under the Crass name was Acts of Love: classical-music settings of 50 poems by Penny Rimbaud, described as [...] "songs to my other self" [...] and intended to celebrate [...] "the profound sense of unity, peace and love that exists within that other self".|$|E

[...] Before the filming, {{the cast and crew}} {{gathered}} on the USS Arizona memorial for a wreath-laying by a representative of Touchstone Pictures, Jerry Bruckheimer and Bay. The producers brought fifteen vintage planes to Ford Island, placing them in one hangar for the filming. In addition, they brought fifteen ships back to Pearl Harbor for live bombardment (without sinking them). [...] The operations room of the control tower was converted into a barracks for the filming. The Pacific Aviation Museum hoped that the film would increase public awareness of the tower and spur support for its restoration. Bay reflected on the historic significance of Ford Island: [...] "I have a vivid memory of showing the crew around Ford Island during pre-production. We came upon a plaque directly across from the sunken Arizona, marking the spot where a torpedo hit nearly six decades ago. My crew stood in silence for three minutes at the sight of this small monument.

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] delves on the [...] "highest of {{highs and}} lowest of lows" [...] {{encountered}} {{in a relationship}} which has turned sour, hence the song's name. Gaga described it during an interview with iHeartMedia as being [...] "about modern ecstasy [...] We found our sweet, simple, ragey way of saying it. I get this sick adrenaline rush every time I hear it". The singer further clarified that the lyrics ultimately was a commentary on social media and the problems one face trying to present a perfect representation of themselves. Media reports speculated that the lyrics alluded to the singer's breakup from her boyfriend, actor Taylor Kinney, around July 2016. Samantha Schnurr from E! decoded the lyrics, saying that the repetition of the phrase [...] "perfect illusion" [...] was about their relationship. Gaga retorted during an interview with SiriusXM that the song was not for Kinney, and was not a [...] "revenge" [...] track. [...] "I love Taylor so, so much and this song is not a hit out against him [...] It's a record about all of <b>us.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> would never use my song or {{want to use the}} public to hurt anyone that I love so much," [...] the singer added.|$|E

Butler and Deu's musical ideas {{began to develop}} and the first {{incarnation}} of the band was born while they were attending McGill University and Concordia University, respectively. The duo began rehearsing their material at McGill where they met Régine Chassagne, a music student whom they asked to join them. Deu recalls, [...] "Win and I played guitar. Everyone played guitar. We had no music to show her, but she ended up saying yes to joining <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don’t know why. Maybe {{there was a little}} spark with Win." [...] The trio recorded a set of demos and began performing live {{in the second half of}} 2001. At that time, the band consisted of Butler, Chassagne, Deu, multi-instrumentalist Tim Kyle (later of Wild Light), bassist Myles Broscoe (later of Les Angles Morts, Crystal Clyffs, and AIDS Wolf), guitarist/drummer Dane Mills (later of Crackpot) and multi-instrumentalist Brendan Reed (later of Les Angles Morts and founding member of Clues), who lived with Butler and Chassagne in Montreal's Mile End neighbourhood at the time and was a collaborator with them on song-writing and arrangement (2001–2003).|$|E

500|$|On {{allowing}} {{directors and}} writers {{to work within}} Marvel's shared universe concept, Joe Russo said that Feige has [...] "big pieces that he knows he wants to build towards, but {{the way that you}} get there is open to interpretation and improv a little bit." [...] For the Russos in The Winter Soldier, they {{had to deal with the}} idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. being infiltrated by Hydra, with Joe saying, [...] "how we get there is all up to <b>us.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film." [...] Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team [...] "come up with conceptually what we want to do" [...] for a film, then we will ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film? That's where you start looking for the interconnectedness, but it's very important early on that the concept be created in a bubble because you have to protect the idea, it has to be driven by storytelling.

500|$|The Texian {{position}} {{was surrounded by}} trees, leaving the Mexican cavalry no room to maneuver. [...] The 200 members of the cavalry remained {{on the west bank}} of the river, behind the Texians, to foil any escape attempts. Lieutenant Colonel José Maria Mendosa brought the Mexican infantry and artillery across the river to a position below that of the Texians. [...] In response, Texians trimmed undergrowth near their camp to provide better visibility and dug steps into the embankment so that they could more easily climb up to fire. [...] The two sides skirmished desultorily for two hours, until the fog began to lift. At that point, 5060 Mexican infantrymen crossed the prairie to surround the Texians. [...] Seeing their approach, Bowie shouted to his Texian forces, [...] "Keep under cover, boys, and reserve your fire; we haven't a man to spare!" [...] At [...] from the Texian position, the Mexican infantry halted and formed a line with the cannon in the middle. [...] They began firing as they advanced toward the Texian positions, to little effect. [...] For the most part, the Mexican volleys passed over the heads of the Texians. [...] According to Texian Noah Smithwick, [...] "grapeshot and canister thrashed through the pecan trees overhead, raining a shower of ripe nuts down on <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw men picking them up and eating them with as little concern as if they were being shaken down by a norther." [...] In his official report to Austin, Bowie remarked that [...] "The discharge from the enemy was one continued blaze of fire, whilst that from our lines, was more slowly delivered, but with good aim and deadly effect." [...] The Mexican infantry were assigned Brown Bess muskets, which had a maximum range of only , compared to the [...] effective range of the Texian long rifles. [...] The Texians were short of ammunition, however, and although Mexican ammunition was plentiful, it was poor quality.

500|$|Oxbow drew post {{position}} {{five for}} the Haskell, carried the highest weight at 122 pounds, {{and was the}} second favorite in the race behind Verrazano. [...] Leading for {{the early part of}} the race, Oxbow was challenged for the lead by Verrazano at the three-quarter-mile marker, then weakened and finished fourth, earning another $60,000. Stevens felt something was wrong with Oxbow at the half-mile pole, later saying the horse [...] "didn’t feel like he did in any of the Triple Crown races", and Lukas stated the jockey [...] "kind of held" [...] Oxbow from that point on. Oxbow was pulled up soon after crossing the finish line, then his rider jumped off and removed the saddle when Oxbow failed to jog sound on the track. [...] The horse walked back to the barn without obvious sign of injury, and radiographs of his right front ankle revealed no fracture, but he did have a soft tissue injury to the area, described as a [...] "sprain". Of Oxbow's overall health, Lukas commented, [...] "he had a pretty set of X-rays. It's amazing. For a horse with that many , they were really clean." [...] Nonetheless, as a result of the soft tissue injury, Oxbow was taken out of races for the duration of the summer, and after three weeks of hand-walking at Saratoga was shipped home to Calumet in mid-August, with an announcement that he was not anticipated to run again in 2013. Lukas said: [...] "He's been a warrior and a hell of a nice horse for <b>us</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't want to do anything to jeopardize his future down the line." [...] On October 25, 2013, Calumet Farm announced the decision to retire Oxbow. Combined with his winnings in his two-year-old season, his lifetime race earnings were $1,243,500. [...] He stood at stud for the 2014 breeding season at [...] Taylor Made Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, for an introductory stud fee of $20,000. He closed out the year ranked 17th in earnings with $1,146,000 won in 2013.

The laurels fought for and obtained in all parts [...] the globe [...] war, have procured us a fame so glorious as not to be equalled by people in any fame not to be sullied by the assaults of prejudice, nor the effects of time: not an action in which we were not victorious, not a siege in which we were not honoured. Will you, my dear countrymen, permit those laurels to fade, or those actions to be forgotten? No, forbid it, heaven! Let us now that we have it in our power convey to later posterity a renewal of our fidelity, and a confirmation of our loyalty. A more critical period never presented itself, nor had we ever a fairer opportunity of shewing our attachment to the illustrious house of Hanover, than the present, as his Majesty's deluded subjects in America are in open rebellion, and like unnatural children, wound their ever indulgent parent, forgetting the torrents of blood spilt, and heap of treasure expended for their preservation.
