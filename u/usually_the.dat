5|$|Ab initio phasing {{or direct}} methods – This is <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> method {{of choice for}} small {{molecules}} (<1000 non-hydrogen atoms), and has been used successfully to solve the phase problems for small proteins. If {{the resolution of the}} data is better than 1.4 Å (140 pm), direct methods can be used to obtain phase information, by exploiting known phase relationships between certain groups of reflections.|$|E
5|$|After the 1920 season, Barrow {{resigned}} from the Red Sox to become the business manager of the Yankees, replacing the deceased Harry Sparrow. He took control of building the roster, which was <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> field manager's responsibility in those days. With the Yankees, Barrow handled the signing of player contracts, although owner Jacob Ruppert personally handled the contracts of Ruth and Lou Gehrig.|$|E

5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the {{southwest}} corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (<b>usually</b> <b>the</b> northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war dead, are targets for vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception. The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> work of young people, noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays. Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with replicas made of fibreglass.|$|E
50|$|The Black-Scholes model {{assumes that}} the market {{consists}} {{of at least one}} risky asset, <b>usually</b> called <b>the</b> stock, and one riskless asset, <b>usually</b> called <b>the</b> money market, cash, or bond.|$|R

5|$|Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> {{main cause}} of PID. Data suggest that PID is often polymicrobial. Isolated anaerobes and facultative {{microorganisms}} have been obtained from the upper genital tract. N. gonorrhoeae has been isolated from fallopian tubes, facultative and anaerobic organisms were recovered from endometrial tissues.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{the top end}} of a clarinet's {{range is}} difficult, since many {{advanced}} players can produce notes well above the highest notes commonly found in method books. G6 is <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> highest note clarinetists encounter in classical repertoire. The C above that (C7 i.e. resting on the fifth ledger line above the treble staff) is attainable by advanced players and is shown on many fingering charts, and fingerings as high as A7 exist.|$|E
5|$|Highly innervated, the glans {{exists at}} the tip of the {{clitoral}} body as a fibro-vascular cap, and is <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> size and shape of a pea, although it is sometimes much larger or smaller. While whether or not the glans is composed of erectile or non-erectile tissue is subject to debate (see above), it, or the entire clitoris, is estimated to have 8,000 or more sensory nerve endings.|$|E
50|$|Friðrik <b>usually</b> played <b>the</b> Sicilian Defence against 1.e4 and the King's Indian Defence and Nimzo-Indian Defence against 1.d4. With White, he <b>usually</b> played <b>the</b> English Opening, but he {{also played}} 1.d4, 1.e4 and 1.Nf3 many times.|$|R

5|$|If a country's {{authorities}} wish to devalue {{or prevent}} appreciation against market forces exerting upwards {{pressure on the}} currency, and retain control of interest rates, as is <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> case, they will need capital controls in place—due to conditions that arise from the impossible trinity trilemma.|$|E
5|$|If {{the leader}} of the {{opposition}} party is not a Member of Parliament, then a sitting MP takes the role of acting Leader of the Opposition until the party leader can obtain a seat. If there is a leadership race occurring within the party, an MP (<b>usually</b> <b>the</b> interim party leader) will serve as Leader of the Opposition until a new party leader is chosen.|$|E
5|$|Interestingly, the funerary {{complex of}} the layer pyramid shows {{no trace of}} an {{enclosure}} wall, which is present in both earlier and later pyramid complexes. This could be because the stones constituting the wall were robbed over time, or simply because the wall was never started, being <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> last element of the pyramid complex to be built.|$|E
5|$|The comitatenses, {{and later}} the palatini were {{strategic}} reserves, <b>usually</b> in <b>the</b> rear.

50|$|Unit testing {{refers to}} tests that verify the {{functionality}} {{of a specific}} section of code, <b>usually</b> at <b>the</b> function level.

5|$|Numerous game {{players have}} also {{reported}} problems with static shocks to the X-Plorer guitars causing various fret buttons (<b>usually</b> <b>the</b> green one) to permanently malfunction. Multiple exchanges of guitars have not solved the problem, as exchanged guitars also exhibit the problem. To date, RedOctane has not solved the problem, and {{has refused to}} extend warranties to replacement guitars, time limiting the warranty {{back to the original}} date of purchase.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species that}} are less {{commonly}} affected include cats and horses, {{as well as other}} large domestic animals. In cats, hypothyroidism is <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> result of other medical treatment such as surgery or radiation. In young horses, congenital hypothyroidism has been reported predominantly in Western Canada and has been linked with the mother's diet.|$|E
5|$|Pilophorus acicularis can be {{separated}} from similar species by its tall pseudopodetia. It may be confused with P.robustus, especially in material from Alaska where both species occur together. <b>Usually,</b> <b>the</b> different branching (umbellate in P.robustus versus dichotomous in P.acicularis) {{and the lack of}} a columella (an internal, column-shaped structure) in longitudinal sections of the pseudopodetia of P.acicularis make it relatively easy to distinguish between the two.|$|E
50|$|Splits {{may also}} issue Packaged Units {{combining}} certain classes of share, <b>usually</b> reflecting <b>the</b> share classes in <b>the</b> trust <b>usually</b> in <b>the</b> same ratio.

5|$|The President {{appoints}} as Prime Minister an MP who, in his judgment, {{is likely}} to command {{the confidence of the}} majority of the MPs. In practice, the Prime Minister is <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> leader of the political party holding the majority of the seats in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice between}} scuba and surface {{supplied}} diving equipment {{is based on}} both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is <b>usually</b> <b>the</b> choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly commercial diving, may be restricted to surface supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{clarinet}} is {{prominent in}} Bulgarian wedding music also; {{it is an}} offshoot of Roma/Romani traditional music. Ivo Papazov is a well-known clarinetist in this genre.
