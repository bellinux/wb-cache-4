5|$|After the war, {{the city}} {{underwent}} {{a process of}} urban renewal and expansion from the 1890s up to the 1920s. As downtown Lima had become overcrowded, the La Victoria residential area was established in 1896 as a working-class neighborhood. During this period the <b>urban</b> <b>layout</b> was modified by the construction of big avenues which crisscrossed the city and connected it with neighboring towns such as Miraflores. In the 1920s and 1930s, several buildings of the historic centre were rebuilt including the Government Palace and the Municipal Palace.|$|E

The city's cultural scene spans its history, dating back to Roman times: the city started to be built in that period, which has left its mark on the <b>urban</b> <b>layout</b> (centered on today's Piața Muzeului) as well as surviving ruins. However, the medieval town saw a shift in its centre towards new civil and religious structures, notably St. Michael's Church.|$|E

He set which territories would belong to Curuzu Cuatiá and Mandisoví, and organised their <b>urban</b> <b>layout</b> around the chapel and school. By November the army arrived at the coast of Paraná near Apipé island, and there Belgrano took measures to benefit the natives that were living in missions. With his authority as speaker of the Junta he gave them full civil and political rights, granted lands, authorised commerce with the United Provinces, and lifted their restriction on taking public or religious office. However, the Junta requested later that he should seek authorization for such changes in the future.|$|E

5|$|Japan's bomb-damaged {{cities were}} rebuilt after the war. War damage {{and the need}} to rehouse {{soldiers}} and civilians returning from overseas resulted in a shortage of 4.2million units of housing which, combined with food shortages, led to many civilians being forced to live in harsh conditions. In September 1945 the Japanese government offered to provide material for 300,000 small temporary houses to evacuees, but the emphasis of its policies in this year and 1946 was to stop people returning to the damaged cities. The reconstruction of 115 cities began in 1946, and this work was conducted in line with guidelines developed by the Japanese government. The Allied occupation authorities were not involved in the urban rebuilding effort, but allowed this work to go ahead despite criticizing it as inappropriate to Japan's status as a defeated country. Requisitions of land and buildings for use by the occupation force and a requirement that the Japanese government prioritize the construction of housing for the Allied troops interfered with reconstruction, however. In many cities rebuilding was accompanied by a process of land readjustment which sought to improve the <b>urban</b> <b>layout,</b> though the success of both such readjustment and rebuilding programs varied between locations. Overall, most of the new buildings constructed were of poor quality, and it was not until well after the war that major urban improvement projects were undertaken.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} preservation, {{reconstruction}} and conversion of historic <b>urban</b> <b>layouts</b> and historic buildings {{have been discussed}} in the article. Although some of the <b>urban</b> <b>layouts</b> and structures are not monuments by formal means, they are often being well protected by local law (Local Development Plans). Both the quantity of the original structures (very few remained original- many objects within the layout have been already converted) {{and the quality of}} the original substance and architectural layout- to little space, many elements which need reconstruction- allow to raise a question: Does preservation or reconstruction still make sense, and does conversion should be allowed. Several case studies have been discussed: Wolf's Throat in Gliwice (Glaubenstatt) - <b>urban</b> village <b>layout</b> set up by Germans in 1941, design for house conversion in Wolfsthroat and also Szobiszowice (Schobischowitz) in Gliwice- one of the <b>urban</b> neighborhoods <b>layout</b> set up by Germans before the II-nd world.

25|$|After independence, Lima {{became the}} capital of the Republic of Peru but {{economic}} stagnation and political turmoil brought urban development to a halt. This hiatus ended in the 1850s, when increased public and private revenues from guano exports led to a rapid development of the city. The export-led expansion also widened the gap between rich and poor, fostering social unrest. During the 1879–1883 War of the Pacific, Chilean troops occupied Lima, looting public museums, libraries and educational institutions. At the same time, angry mobs attacked wealthy citizens and the Asian population; sacking their properties and businesses. The city underwent renewal and expansion from the 1890s to the 1920s. During this period the <b>urban</b> <b>layout</b> was modified by the construction of broad avenues that crisscrossed the city and connected it with neighboring towns.|$|E
25|$|City Palace, Jaipur, which {{includes}} the Chandra Mahal and Mubarak Mahal palaces and other buildings, is a palace complex in Jaipur, {{the capital of the}} Rajasthan state, India. It was the seat of the Maharaja of Jaipur, the head of the Kachwaha Rajput clan. The Chandra Mahal palace now houses a museum, but the greatest part of it is still a royal residence. The palace complex, located northeast of the centre of the grid-patterned Jaipur city, incorporates an impressive and vast array of courtyards, gardens and buildings. The palace was built between 1729 and 1732, initially by Sawai Jai Singh II, the ruler of Amber. He planned and built the outer walls, and later additions were made by successive rulers continuing up to the 20th century. The credit for the <b>urban</b> <b>layout</b> of the city and its structures is attributed to two architects namely, Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, the chief architect in the royal court and Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob, apart from the Sawai himself who was a keen architectural enthusiast. The architects achieved a fusion of the Shilpa Shastra of Indian architecture with Rajput, and Mughal.|$|E

500|$|Zhang's long lyrical poems also {{revealed}} {{a great amount}} of information on <b>urban</b> <b>layout</b> and basic geography. His rhapsody [...] "Sir Based-On-Nothing" [...] provides details on terrain, palaces, hunting parks, markets, and prominent buildings of Chang'an, the Western Han capital. Exemplifying his attention to detail, his rhapsody on Nanyang described gardens filled with spring garlic, summer bamboo shoots, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, perilla, evodia, and purple ginger. Zhang Heng's writing confirms the size of the imperial hunting park in the suburbs of Chang'an, as his estimate for the circumference of the park's encircling wall agrees with the historian Ban Gu's estimate of roughly 400li (one li in Han times was equal to 415.8m, or 1,364ft, making the circumference of the park wall 166,320m, or 545,600ft). Along with Sima Xiangru (179–117BC), Zhang listed a variety of animals and hunting game inhabiting the park, which were divided in the northern and southern portions of the park according to where the animals had originally came from: northern or southern China. Somewhat similar to the description of Sima Xiangru, Zhang described the Western Han emperors and their entourage enjoying boat outings, water plays, fishing, and displays of archery targeting birds and other animals with stringed arrows from the tops of [...] along Chang'an's Kunming Lake. The focus of Zhang's writing on specific places and their terrain, society, people, and their customs could also be seen as early attempts of ethnographic categorization. In his poem [...] "Xijing fu", Zhang shows that he was aware of the new foreign religion of Buddhism, introduced via the Silk Road, as well as the legend of the birth of Buddha with the vision of the white elephant bringing about conception. In his [...] "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" [...] (西京賦), Zhang described court entertainments such as juedi (角抵), a form of theatrical wrestling accompanied by music in which participants butted heads with bull horn masks.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, the Greek philosopher Hippodamus (5th century BC) is {{regarded}} as the first town planner and ‘inventor’ of the orthogonal <b>urban</b> <b>layout.</b> Aristotle called him [...] "the father of city planning", and until well into the 20th century, he was indeed regarded as such.

Archaeological finds from ancient Egypt—among others—demonstrate that Hippodamus cannot truly have been the inventor of this layout. Aristotle's critique and indeed ridicule of Hippodamus, which appears in Politics 2. 8, is perhaps the first known example of a criticism of urban planning.|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} decades, {{as a result}} of {{continuously}} increasing urbanization and climate change, energy saving has become a critical issue. Due to the high dwelling density, most compact urban areas have limited possibilities for natural ventilation combined with reduced solar radiation. As a consequence, a balance has to be found between reduced comfort and increased energy cost for cooling or heating. The aim {{of this study is to}} minimise the energy consumption and optimize thermal comfort of terraced houses in different urban patterns, by using natural ventilation and considering solar radiation. This study analyses different parameters on the level of buildings and <b>urban</b> <b>layouts.</b> The building characteristics include building sizes, window design, materials and internal wind permeability. The <b>urban</b> <b>layouts</b> consist of different building heights, setbacks and road widths. Energy consumption and thermal comfort are calculated by a dynamic simulation using EnergyPlus.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the {{transformation}} of spatial structures of towns in North-Eastern Poland, characterized by different origins and happening due to the construction of railway line. The region in question was in the past subject to different settlement processes taking place against the background of historical events such as, among others, the conquest of land by the Teutonic Knights and the political partition of Poland (the border between Prussia and Russia), thereby forming diverse urban systems, later influenced by the railway, which modified their spatial structures, as well as changed their existing importance in the region. As a result of aforementioned changes different forms of <b>urban</b> <b>layouts</b> were formed - line layouts within the historic towns and more complicated layouts within the new railway settlements. The entire analytical procedure was based mainly on archival cartographic materials and divided into three parts: conditions of settlements development, analyze the evolution of its spatial layouts and the typology of researched <b>urban</b> <b>layouts.</b> The chronological summary of the parts allowed for the comparison of the spatial structure of a given town and for its interpretation.
