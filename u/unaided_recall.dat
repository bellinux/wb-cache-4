40|$|Brand awareness, {{as one of}} the {{fundamental}} dimensions of brand equity, is often considered to be a prerequisite of consumers’ buying decision, as it represents the main factor for including a brand in the consideration set. Brand awareness can also influence consumers’ perceived risk assessment and their confidence in the purchase decision, due to familiarity with the brand and its characteristics. On the other hand, brand awareness can be depicted into at least two facets – <b>unaided</b> (brand <b>recall)</b> and aided (brand recognition) – each of the two facets having its more or less effective influence on buying decision and perceived risk assessment. This paper tries to reveal, on one hand, the importance of unaided brand awareness when it comes to consumers’ buying decision and, on the other hand, the importance of aided brand awareness when assessing the perceived risk associated with the purchase. The analysis is conducted in a comparative manner, considering the case of durable versus non-durable products, and with focus on urban Romanian consumers. brand aided and unaided awareness, brand choice, perceived risk...|$|R
40|$|Millions of rands {{are spent}} on {{sponsorship}} in general every year, and on sports sponsorships in particular. Yet {{little is known}} about the effectiveness of this expenditure. In addition, sponsors are often not sure whether only their brands benefit from a sponsorship or whether competing brands in the same product category also benefit from their efforts. In this study an attempt is made to clarify these consideratio ns by comparing both the brand recall and the brand recognition of companies (and brands) who sponsored the 2007 Cricket World Cup. To determine whether brand recall and brand recognition increased during a sponsorship campaign, a quasi-experimental study was conducted by means of a one-group pre-test-post-test design. The data were collected using a convenience sample of 131 undergraduate students. The results seem to suggest that both the brand recall and the brand recognition levels of the sponsors increased significantly (α = 0, 05), but that neither the brand recall nor the brand recognition levels of non-sponsor brands increased. The results therefore show that sponsorship does in fact increase brand awareness, by significantly increasing <b>unaided</b> brand <b>recall,</b> as well as increasing brand recognition and that non-sponsoring companies and brands do not benefit indirectly from their competitors' sponsorships in terms of brand recall and brand recognition.

50|$|Brand recall is {{also known}} as <b>unaided</b> <b>recall</b> or {{spontaneous}} recall and refers to the ability of the consumers to correctly elicit a brand name from memory when prompted by a product category. Brand recall indicates a relatively strong link between a category and a brand while brand recognition indicates a weaker link. When prompted by a product category, most consumers can only recall a relatively small set of brands, typically around 3-5 brand names. In consumer tests, few consumers can recall more than seven brand names within a given category and for low-interest product categories, most consumers can only recall one or two brand names.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using verbal repetition and first-letter acronyms {{to teach a}} common marketing framework was examined in two experiments. In Experiment 1, 345 undergraduate students {{were exposed to the}} framework using one of four conditions: control, verbal repetition, acronym, and verbal repetition plus acronym in a traditional learning setting. Students were tested for <b>unaided</b> <b>recall</b> of the concepts as well as concept application and analysis. Results indicate that using acronyms increased student scores at 2 weeks and 3 months for both <b>unaided</b> <b>recall</b> and analysis, but verbal repetition had no significant effect, either alone or in conjunction with the acronym. Experiment 2 tested the impact of acronym use in an active learning setting. Here, 129 undergraduate students were exposed to the framework using only an active learning method or the active learning method plus an acronym. Students were tested for <b>unaided</b> <b>recall</b> and concept application and analysis at 2 weeks and 3 months after exposure. Use of the acronym increased scores for both <b>unaided</b> <b>recall</b> and concept application and analysis compared to the active learning method alone.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential of local radio {{as a source of}} agricultural communication in Ghana. The main thrust of the research was to investigate the levels of <b>unaided</b> <b>recall</b> and comprehension of agricultural radio messages among rural farmers. Eight experiments were conducted in eight rural communities. In all, 252 farmers were used as subjects for the experiments. The experiments investigated the effects of specific production and audience factors on <b>unaided</b> <b>recall</b> and message understanding. The survey involved the use of questionnaires to gather data through interviews with 365 farmers. Survey methodology was used to profile rural radio listeners in Ghana; and to glean insights into the sources of general and agricultural news for rural farmers, the farmers' radio listening behaviours, radio programme format preferences, and their levels of adoption of radio agricultural messages. <b>Unaided</b> <b>recall</b> and comprehension of broadcast news were found to be generally low. Two programming variables [...] - recaps of news items and repeat broadcasts [...] - demonstrated significant impact on farmers' recall and comprehension of radio agricultural messages. Item duration was found to be very potent in influencing memory recall. Younger farmers recorded significantly higher <b>unaided</b> <b>recall</b> and comprehension scores than older farmers; and farmers with higher education performed better in free recall and comprehension of broadcast messages than those with lower levels of education. The study found that radio is the most popular source of general and agricultural news to farmers. The farmers relied mostly on radio, extension agents and interpersonal communication for agricultural information. While the farmers reported that the extension agent was the most credible among all the sources of agricultural communication, they rated radio as the most reliable...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of creativity in advertising {{as one of}} the primary factor for advertising effectiveness has been much advocated by advertising professionals and academicians particularly in a cluttered media. Industry experts argue that advertisements have to be more creative to break through the greater media clutter and develop an impression for the brand. This study examines the potential effectiveness of award winning television advertisements in Pakistan in both single and three advertising exposures. To ensure a real life advertising situation, both creative and control advertisements were embedded in a television program which were shown to two separate groups of research subjects with single and three advertising exposures respectively. Based on recall of the experimental advertisements in single and three exposures, subjects’ tapped their responses about brand and advertisement attitude and lastly purchase intent. Contrary to expectations, the finding of this study in single exposure does not verify the superior performance of creative advertising in terms of recall, brand and advertisement attitude and purchase intent. However, in three exposures, creative advertisements developed significantly more favorable brand and advertisement attitude and greater <b>unaided</b> brand <b>recall</b> than control advertisements. Creative advertisements developed greater mean purchase intent for the advertised brands than control group of advertisements; however, it just slipped from attaining significance.

So, which design makes online-advertisement eye-catching? Regarding sectoral trends for a more emotional and minimalist design the focus of this diploma thesis is on making online-advertisement more effective. Therefore, 15 designs of online-ads were prepared and tested by 27 participants within a laboratory environment. The goal of this thesis is to find out if pleasing faces which are closely connected with a corporate logo are more attractive than advertisement with a less personal or compact design.

40|$|Governments and {{communities}} increasingly expect protected areas {{not only to}} act as conservation cornerstones, but to deliver {{a broad range of}} social and economic benefits primarily through tourism. The brand category assigned to a protected area can dramatically influence tourism levels and be a valuable point of differentiation. However, with over 1000 protected area brand categories in use worldwide and more than 55 such categories in Australia alone, standing out from the crowd is problematic. World Heritage, an internationally acclaimed brand category, recognizes properties containing resources of such outstanding 'universal value' to the entire world they must be protected in perpetuity for future generations to appreciate. The World Heritage brand heightens the international profile of properties and creates a unique point of differentiation. Furthermore, some individual World Heritage Areas have attained 'celebrity status' possessing instantly recognisable brand names that are among the best known brands in the world. For example, the Galapagos Islands and Grand Canyon National Park are names that instantly convey a series of iconic images. With over 7, 700 parks in Australia, famous World Heritage properties such as Kakadu National Park or the Great Barrier Reef have a competitive advantage over lesser known protected areas. As protected area brands {{play a critical role in}} determining the level of visitation to any property, there is surprisingly little empirical research focused specifically on visitors and their relationship with the World Heritage brand. This dissertation is designed to expand existing knowledge on the relationship between World Heritage and visitors by undertaking research on the role of the World Heritage brand in attracting visitors to protected areas in Queensland, Australia. Based on identified research gaps, five objectives were developed to collectively address the overall aim. The objectives for this study are: 1. to develop a practical framework on the roles protected site brands play for their primary stakeholders; 2. to create a set of standardized, comparable data sets across World Heritage Areas in Queensland and analyse the data to demonstrate the benefits of such monitoring efforts; 3. to identify the level of visitor awareness of the World Heritage brand when visiting a World Heritage site in Queensland; 4. to gauge the influence of the World Heritage brand in attracting visitors to World Heritage sites in Queensland; and, 5. to determine if some individuals specifically collect World Heritage sites; and if so, identify their sociodemographic characteristics. The research methodology consisted of a four stage approach. Focus groups informed the development of the visitor survey instrument. A self-completion questionnaire was twice piloted and refined before being administered across Queensland's World Heritage Areas on a monthly basis between 1 April and 31 July, 2008. A total of 1827 valid questionnaires were collected. The study sites were the Australian Fossil Mammal Sites (Riversleigh), Fraser Island, the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia, the Great Barrier Reef and the Wet Tropics of Australia. Semi-structured interviews with experts were conducted to gather background information pertinent to the present branding situation within each study site. Last, general on-site signage and visitor observations were made during the study period. Descriptive analyses, Chi-square along with analyses of variance were used to investigate the relationships between different variables. Research findings were revealing. The Australian Fossil Mammal Sites (Riversleigh), the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia and Fraser Island possess distinctive visitor socio-demographic profiles while the Wet Tropics of Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef generally have more similar profiles. Only one-third of Queensland's World Heritage visitors had 'top of mind' awareness of the brand when exiting the site they had just visited. Furthermore, visitors exiting the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia and the Wet Tropics of Queensland could not <b>recall</b> <b>unaided</b> the name of the World Heritage Area they just visited. There was no signage within in the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia study sites containing the name of the World Heritage Area. Only visitors to the Australian Fossil Mammal Sites (Riversleigh) demonstrated significantly increased awareness of the World Heritage brand after time spent on-site, while visitors to the other four World Heritage Areas showed little change in brand awareness. Less than five percent of all visitors could correctly recall what a modified version of the World Heritage emblem represented. However, approximately one in four visitors indicated the World Heritage brand influenced their decision to visit the study location. Approximately the same number of visitors indicated they would go out of their way to visit a World Heritage Area, visit a national park for a longer period of time if they were aware it was also World Heritage branded, and would prefer to visit natural World Heritage sites over other protected area brands in Australia. This research determined the World Heritage brand is a collectable experience. The findings of this dissertation are significant. This is the first study in Queensland to explore in-depth the relationship between the visitor and the World Heritage brand. It establishes the first comparable baseline set of visitor sociodemographic data across all of Queensland’s World Heritage Areas. A published report based on the findings of this research has advised the Australian World Heritage Advisory Committee. A second report was forwarded as an IUCN endorsed briefing document to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee subgroup working on World Heritage branding issues. Thus, the findings of this dissertation have already impacted policy regarding the World Heritage brand at the national and international level. The researcher also advanced the literature by developing a practical framework identifying the roles of protected area brands among major stakeholders, a surprising gap in the literature...|$|R

This study investigated the relationship of remedial readers' concept of reading to reading miscues, <b>unaided</b> <b>recall</b> and aided recall. [...] Twenty remedial readers were randomly selected from the university clinic files. These readers ranged in age from six to sixteen years. Data were collected for each child on four reading related aspects: interview sheet, miscues, aided and unaided recalls. [...] The most important finding in this study is that at the independent reading level remedial readers actively engaged in meaning seeking rather than decoding words as was reflected in their interview and as is reported in many studies on good and poor readers. [...] Most of the remedial readers were word dependent; that is when asked they indicated that reading is saying all the words correctly. At both the independent and instructional levels of reading, the percentage of acceptable miscues made was similar but the total number of unacceptable miscues made at the instructional level was twice that at the independent level. At the independent level, the percentage of recall was greater than the percentage of recall at the instructional level. At both levels, the <b>unaided</b> <b>recall</b> was text based, that is, the remedial readers recalled the information almost exactly as it was written in the text without paraphrasing or embellishing the information. At both the independent and instructional levels, the recall increased substantially when questions were asked indicating a dependence on probing to help these remedial readers recall more information than they readily organize and retrieve.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of graphic post {{organizer}} training upon learning from text ability. The sixth graders, who constituted the sample, were selected from a group of sixth graders demonstrating a weakness in understanding text organization. They were assigned to either the experimental group, which received graphic post organizer training, or the control group, which read the identical materials, but performed different activities. The passages utilized by both groups had been previously randomly selected from sixth grade texts. ^ Posttest measures included an individually devised graphic post organizer which was evaluated by a team of judges using a holistic scoring system. The other two posttest measures, a passage dependent recognition test and an <b>unaided</b> <b>recall</b> test, were administered twice: immediately after the instructional sessions were concluded, and again ten days later. A different group of raters scored the <b>unaided</b> <b>recall</b> protocols by comparing pausal units in the protocols to the original text. ^ The test data were analyzed using a t-test, a repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance and a series of correlations to evaluate group and test differences. The t-test results favored the experimental group, indicating a significant difference between the two groups in the ability to graphically organize. However, the repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance found no other significant differences between the experimental and control groups. In addition, no strong correlations between graphic post organizers and the other posttest measures were reported. ^ Therefore, three conclusions were drawn from the statistical analyses of the data: (1) it was possible to train students to graphically organize text materials; (2) teaching subjects to graphically organize did not appear to transfer and increase general learning from text ability; and (3) graphic post organizer scores did not correlate well with other posttest measures. ...|$|E

Plausible arguments suggest both positive and negative effects of social TV viewing on ad-effectiveness. This study contributes by providing evidence for the direction of social TV&# 039;s effects. The results of a controlled laboratory experiment suggest that the benefits of social TV, principally its association with live TV and therefore less ad-avoidance, come at the cost of negative distraction effects. Like normal coviewing, social TV viewing distracts from ad-processing, reducing <b>unaided</b> <b>recall</b> and brand attitude favorability, compared to individual (solus) viewing. However, social TV messaging about ads improved brand attitude. Perceived creativity increased the likelihood of ad-related messaging. Social TV also has an additional source of distraction, multitasking, but in this study, multitasking did not further reduce ad-effectiveness compared to coviewing.

An evoked set is a set of products of which a consumer is aware and which are considered for purchase. The proliferation of brands occurring in the consumer goods markets, create information processing problems for the consumers. They must often devise means to simplify their purchase decisions. One of the results of this simplification process is the existence of what is referred to as "evoked set", which include the brands the buyer considers when he contemplates purchasing a unit of the product class. Since the evoked set is a subset of the products available in the marketplace, the evoked set formation is seen as an information load reducing mechanism used by consumers to reduce the cognitive complexity of the brand choice process.

40|$|Much {{business}} communication {{is directed to}} consumers-for example, contracts, warranties, directions, instructions, package labels, and package inserts. Consum-ers use these communications in different ways, and the usefulness of such docu-ments cannot be evaluated by readability formulas or rating scales. This paper advocates that consumer communications be evaluated as to their usability, tested by consumers in actual use situations. As an illustration, testing of several versions of a consumer loan contract is demonstrated, in comparison to formula and rating scale evaluations. THE BULK OF ATTENTION to {{business communication}} concerns situations in which one business person writes something to another-for example letters, memos, reports, manuals, or proposals. Another important audience for business communication is consumers. Busi-ness communication to consumers in the contexts of marketing and advertising is amply documented (e. g., Kotler, 1980; Aaker and Myers, 1982; Ray, 1982); and more-or-less standard procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of marketing and advertising communica-tions have been developed. For example, the impact of advertising may be evaluated by aided or <b>unaided</b> <b>recall</b> of brand name or adver-tising message; changes in knowledge or attitudes regarding the brand advertised; changes in intention to purchase; and so forth. In addition to marketing-oriented communications to consumers, there are other types of communications which have received less attention from marketing, consumer behavior, and business commu-nication researchers, including: contracts; warranties; policies; direc-tions, instructions or manuals; labels; and package inserts. While interest in these areas has increased in recent years, evaluation proce-dures are still primitive.

40|$|Background: The UK (UK) {{became the}} third {{country in the}} European Union to require {{pictorial}} warnings {{on the back of}} cigarette packs, in October 2008. Methods: A repeat cross-sectional survey was conducted with 11 - 16 -year-olds in the UK between August and September 2008 (N= 1401) and August and September 2011 (N= 1373). At both waves the same text warnings appeared on the front and back of packs, with the only difference being the inclusion of images on the back of packs to support the text warnings in 2011. Warning related measures assessed were salience (noticing, looking closely at warnings), depth of processing (thinking about warnings, discussing them with others), comprehension and credibility (warning comprehensibility, believability and truthfulness), <b>unaided</b> <b>recall,</b> persuasiveness (warnings as a deterrent to smoking), avoidance techniques (eg, hiding packs) and a behavioural indicator (forgoing cigarettes due to warnings). Results: For never smokers, warning persuasiveness and thinking about what warnings are telling them when the pack is in sight significantly increased from 2008 to 2011, but warning comprehensibility significantly decreased. For experimental smokers, there was a significant increase from 2008 to 2011 for warning persuasiveness, believing warnings and considering them truthful. For regular smokers, there were no significant changes from 2008 to 2011, except for an increase in hiding packs to avoid warnings and a decrease in warning salience. Conclusions: Including pictorial images on the back of cigarette packaging improved warning persuasiveness for never and experimental smokers, but had a negligible impact on regular smokers.

The study was conducted in two public school systems within a fifteen-mile radius of the city of Boston. Five hundred and twenty-three pupils were divided into two groups, with 265 in the experimental group and 258 in the control. Groups were equated on the basis of chronological age, mental age, reading achievement, and ability in oral recall. The following battery of seven tests was administered: (1) Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Tests, Beta Test, Form A; (2) Gates Reading Survey for Grade 3 (2 nd Half) to Grade 10, Forms I and II; (3) a social studies test constructed by the investigator; (4) a modified form of the Bogardus Social Distance Scale; (5) a pupil and a teacher questionnaire developed for the purpose of evaluation; and the following instruments developed at Boston University: (6) Bucknam's selections for measuring oral and written recall; and (7) a subject preference rating scale. Reliability was established on the original social studies test and on each of the four recall selections, as tests of both oral and written recall. Teachers evaluated the procedure in individual conferences with the investigator. Conclusions 1. Both groups made significant gains in oral and in written recall. Slightly greater gains were made in each by the experimental group; however, the difference in gains was not statistically significant. 2. The difference in mean score on the social studies test resulted in a critical ratio of 2. 58 which favored the control group. 3. Gains were made by both groups in reading achievement, expressed as reading age. All gains and all differences between the gains of both groups in total reading age, comprehension, vocabulary, and the speed of reading lack statistical significance. 4. Significant gains were made in social acceptance among pupils in both groups. 5. No significant change was found in the attitudes of children toward the social studies. 6. Pupils in experimental classrooms enjoyed the lessons and liked working with a partner. They preferred: reading questions after reading the textbook; answering questions to one paragraph at a time; and giving answers orally. 7. Teachers observed that pupils generally liked the lessons and greatly enjoyed paired practice. Criticisms and Suggestions for Further Study These materials used with virtually complete self-direction on the part of pupils have had practically the same value as the regular teacher-directed method of teaching social studies. Previous research further indicates the value of team learning; therefore, additional research in this area seems justifiable. In future investigations using graded study guides in paired practice, the following changes appear advantageous: 1. Extend the actual working time of the study and cover the textbook material more slowly. 2. Shorten each study guide and provide more time for daily class discussions. 3. Limit the use of study guides to three or four lessons a week. 4. Provide for systematic review at regular intervals. 5. Employ a greater variety of materials. 6. Vary the approach more and add greater flexibility to the procedure. 7. Include specific provisions for enrichment activities. 8. Provide increased opportunities for pupil-teachers to work with the slower pupils who have reading difficulties...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{increase}} {{of the use of}} mobile phones has created new delivery platforms to both marketers and advertisers. As the popularity of mobile devices increases, Short Messaging Service (SMS) has become more important to access potential customers. Recently, Internet and mobile telephony technologies have become more integrated. The marriage of the Internet and wireless telephony that use such platforms as Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) Short Message Services (SMS), and variants of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) can make serious financial contributions to global wireless advertising revenue as a new advertising arena. This new advertising platform, which is wireless advertising or mobile advertising, refers to any communication about products, services, and ideas uses mobile devices for promotional purposes. There are two forms of mobile advertising. The early and the first form is the SMS ads and the second mobile advertising form is Multimedia Message Service (MMS). MMS ads are more creative and effective than was the early mobile advertising form. SMS advertising offers important advantages to the advertiser who seeks to have effective two- way communication with consumers. The research on attitudes toward advertising has two important branches. One is the attitude toward the ad (Aad), and the other is the attitude toward advertising in general. Aad concept is related to a specific advertisement, especially exposure to the advertising in specific mediums. In contrast to Aad, the attitude toward advertising in general is related to the consumers’ general idea of the advertising system and is a more comprehensive concept. Early studies on Aad focus on the consumers’ cognitive information process in terms of recall of ad content, <b>unaided</b> <b>recall,</b> and recognition. Then, studies started to investigate the nature and effects of consumers’ affective reaction to actual advertising stimuli. Consumer attitudes toward advertising in general are widely researched. Most of these studies focus on the structure of advertising attitudes rather than the generalizability of overall attitudes. In other words, respondents typically are asked not only about their overall attitudes toward advertisement, but also their perception of advertising in terms of trustworthiness, offensiveness, informativeness, entertainment value, the effects on product prices and value as well as the attitudes toward regulatory issues. In recent years, consumers’ attitudes towards new medium advertisement, such as the Internet, are being investigated. Most studies attempting to measure attitudes toward online advertising derive their theoretical frameworks from previous studies of attitude toward advertising in general. The starting point of consumer attitudes toward SMS advertising studies is based on the models of consumer attitudes toward online advertising studies and the constructs of those models. Additionally, the Diffusion of Innovation Theory, Technology Acceptance Theory, and the Theory of Reasoned Action have been used to explain consumer attitudes towards SMS advertising. These theories can explain and develop models for both intention and behavior toward acceptance of SMS advertising. According to other studies on consumer attitudes toward SMS advertising, permission, wireless service provider control, mobile advertising trust, perceived irritation, information, entertainment, credibility, and delivery of message are the mentioned factors that explain consumer attitudes toward SMS advertising. However, irritation, information, entertainment, credibility, and permission are the highlighted factors in these studies. This study examines the factors that affect consumer attitudes towards SMS advertising and the relationship between these factors and attitude. Face-to-face survey was the method chosen to collect the data. The questionnaire has two parts. The first part contains 30 items that measures attitudes toward SMS advertising. In {{the second part of the}} questionnaire, age, sex and mobile phone ownership of respondents were determined. Respondents were chosen by using the Convenience Sampling method. The 30 items on the attitude measurement scale were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation. 13 items was excluded analysis and 17 items produced four components with eigenvalues that exceeded 1. These components were named as Infotainment, Life Partner, Privacy, and Irritation. The results show parallel findings to the literature, namely, that Irritation is the most important factor that affects attitudes toward SMS advertising. The research presents a new attitude indicator called “Life Partner” that can be further analyzed in future studies. To investigate the relationship between factors that affect the attitudes toward SMS advertising and attitudes as a construct confirmatory second-order factor analysis was used. attitude is conceptualized as a second order construct that has four dimensions: Infotainment, Life Partner, Privacy, and Irritation. The validity of this developed theory was tested using confirmatory factor analysis. According to the results of confirmatory second-order factor analysis, attitude relates negatively to Infotainment (-. 59) and Life Partner (-. 17), but related positively to Privacy (. 64) and Irritation (. 83). Attitude shows strong relationships with Irritation, Privacy, and Infotainment respectively. Life Partner shows the weakest relationship. The findings of this study show parallel results to those in the literature, meaning that, the attitudes of Turkish consumers toward SMS advertising can be analyzed using similar factors already presented in the literature. Credibility and Permission did not find support in our findings as indicators of attitude toward SMS advertising, but the Life Partner factor did as a new indicator. In future studies, these indicators should be given extra importance and analyzed for their exact position with repeated studies. In this study we focused on the factors affecting attitudes structure rather than intention and behavior dimensions of models. So, in future studies, the finding of this study must be tested with broader models that can include the intention and behavior dimension that originated with the TRA, TAM and Innovation Diffusion theories...|$|E
