5000|$|Apple strudel {{dough is}} a thin, elastic dough, the {{traditional}} preparation {{of which is}} a difficult process. The dough is kneaded by flogging, often against a table top. Dough that appears thick or lumpy after flogging is generally discarded and a new batch is started. After kneading, the dough is rested, then rolled out on a wide surface, and stretched <b>until</b> the <b>dough</b> reaches a thickness similar to phyllo. Cooks say that a single layer should be so thin that one can read a newspaper through it. [...] The dough is also stretched carefully to make it large enough to cover the kneading table.|$|R

50|$|A sponge ferment {{is usually}} a sticky process that uses part of the flour, part {{or all of the}} water, and part or all of the yeast of a total- or straight-dough formula. Highly liquid sponges of batter consistencies are mixed with a whip, spoon, or fork. Lower hydration, stiffer sponges are lightly mixed or kneaded just <b>until</b> the <b>dough</b> begins to develop. The sponge is allowed to rest and ferment {{for a period of time}} in an {{environment}} of a desired temperature and humidity. When the sponge's fermentation time has elapsed or it has reached a desired volumetric growth characteristic, the final dough's ingredients are added. The gluten is developed in the mixing or kneading process, and it may then be processed through further work and rest cycles before being proofed then baked.|$|R

50|$|A typical frybread recipe {{consists}} of flour, water, salt, {{a small amount}} of oil, and baking powder. The ingredients are mixed and worked into a simple dough, and covered with a cloth for 30 minutes to an hour, <b>until</b> the <b>dough</b> rises. It is then formed into small balls, and are either rolled or pulled into flat discs prior to frying in hot oil. Many variations of this basic recipe exist, including substituting mayonnaise for oil in the dough (which produces a crisp, crunchy texture that resists getting soggy - ideal for Navajo tacos), and leavening the dough with a small container of yogurt or soured milk instead of using baking powder or yeast (produces a rich, sourdough flavor but requires several hours to fully leaven after the dough is prepared). Most frybread recipes do not use yeast at all because it was not typically available to Native peoples when this foodstuff was developed. In many Native American households, frybread dough is mixed {{early in the morning and}} left in a large bowl covered with a cloth to leaven and is used throughout the day to prepare fresh bread when needed.|$|R
40|$|Fusarium graminearum is {{the causal}} agent of Gibberella ear rot and {{produces}} trichothecene mycotoxins. Basic questions remain unanswered regarding the kernel stages associated with trichothecene biosynthesis and the kernel metabolites potentially {{involved in the}} regulation of trichothecene production in planta. In a two-year field study, F. graminearum growth, trichothecene accumulation, and phenolic acid composition were monitored in developing maize kernels of a susceptible and a moderately resistant variety using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array or mass spectrometry detection. Infection started {{as early as the}} blister stage and proceeded slowly <b>until</b> the <b>dough</b> stage. Then, a peak of trichothecene accumulation occurred and infection progressed exponentially until the final harvest time. Both F. graminearum growth and trichothecene production were drastically reduced in the moderately resistant variety. We found that chlorogenic acid is more abundant in the moderately resistant variety, with levels spiking in the earliest kernel stages induced by Fusarium infection. This is the first report that precisely describes the kernel stage associated with the initiation of trichothecene production and provides in planta evidence that chlorogenic acid {{may play a role in}} maize resistance to Gibberella ear rot and trichothecene accumulation...|$|R
25|$|The {{ingredients}} to make dried pasta usually include water and semolina flour; egg for colour and richness (in {{some types of}} pasta), and possibly vegetable juice (such as spinach, beet, tomato, carrot), herbs or spices for colour and flavour. After mixing semolina flour with warm water the dough is kneaded mechanically until it becomes firm and dry. If pasta is to be flavoured, eggs, vegetable juices, and herbs are added at this stage. The dough is then passed into the laminator to be flattened into sheets, then compressed by a vacuum mixer-machine to clear out air bubbles and excess water from the <b>dough</b> <b>until</b> the moisture content is reduced to 12%.

40|$|Research {{conducted}} recently {{suggested that}} application of nitrogen fertilizer from flowering <b>until</b> the <b>dough</b> stage could increase grain protein concentration in durum even if nitrogen applications {{earlier in the}} season were adequate for optimum yield. We tested the ability of late season nitrogen application to increase protein at commercial farms in Buckeye, Casa Grande, and Vicksburg. Late season nitrogen increased protein by nearly two percentage points in two out of the three locations. No response was measured at the third location possibly due to high rates or nitrogen {{earlier in the season}}. The cost of the late season fertilizer at 35 to 50 lbs N /acre was about $ 15 /acre. The fertilizer was paid for at the two location where a response was obtained by 1) the slight yield increase of 310 lbs /acre which was worth about $ 23 /acre and 2) the difference in dockage or premiums paid for protein which was worth about $ 38 /acre. It is possible that lower stem nitrate levels could be used to determine whether or late applications of nitrogen will increase protein, but we currently do not have a method to determine if protein will be over the critical level of 13 % or if HVAC will be over the critical level of 90 %...|$|R

40|$|Empek-empek is the {{traditional}} food of Palembang which is made {{of the mixture of}} minced fish and flour and then it is shaped into certain shape. Snakehead Murrel fish (Ikan Gabus) is a kind of fish which produce tasteful empek-empek (crispiness, aroma, colour and taste) and it was loved by the consumer. The high price of Snakehead Murrel fish made the producer of empek-empek turned to use Dorab wolf-herring (Ikan Parang-parang). Empek-empek from Dorab wolf-herring fish was not really liked by the consumer. Various efforts was conducted to produce this empek-empek with the addition of various materials, even with the material which is banned by the government, such as borax.

Introduction: From {{the time}} the flour, yeast and wetting are mixed into a <b>dough,</b> <b>until</b> the fresh white slices of bread are placed upon the table to eat, a certain pleasure is felt by the cook in the accomplishment of so dainty a task, for a perfect loaf of bread represents to her, what deft hands and a clear brain may do, and proclaims her the possessor of a talent worth acquiring. She is now a lady—a loaf giver. The cook of a household is wise if she is mistress of this art of bread-making, for the perfectness of this “Staff of Life” means much towards {{the welfare of the}} persons who may eat of the food. Let her remember that she is, through her cookery, responsible for the habits and desires of the persons for whom she prepares the meals, and that to bear this responsibility rightly she must be an adept in all branches of cookery as well as in that one of bread-making...|$|R
40|$|The four studies {{summarised}} {{and discussed}} in this thesis evaluate the use of whole-crop cereal silage (WCCS) for cattle in dairy production. The dry matter (DM) yield, chemical composition, digestibility, feed intake and milk production for WCCS were evaluated for different cereal species and maturity stages at harvest. The DM yield increased from milk to dough stages of maturity and was higher in winter triticale and rye than in spring barley and oats. Delayed harvest <b>until</b> early <b>dough</b> stage decreased the crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) concentrations in barley, oats and triticale. The concentration of water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) of the fresh crop was highest at the early milk stage, but these carbohydrates were {{to a large extent}} polymerised to starch by the early dough stage of maturity. Both WSC and starch concentrations were lower in oats than in barley, triticale and rye. When fed to dairy heifers the DM intake (DMI) of six-rowed barley was reduced at early milk and early dough stages most likely due to the development of sharp awns on the crop. The DMI of six-rowed barley silage also decreased with delayed maturity stage when fed to dairy cows. The DMI of oats was reduced at the heading and early milk stages of maturity due to low DM content of the silages. The DM digestibilities and organic matter digestibilities (OMD) of oats and winter rye were lower than for barley and winter triticale, as a combined effect of higher NDF concentrations and lower NDF digestibilities in the two former crops. When six-rowed barley silage harvested at the early dough stage was fed to dairy cows in mid-late lactation the daily energy-corrected milk (ECM) yield was 3 kg lower than when barley silage at heading was fed, due to reductions in milk yield, and both protein and fat concentrations in the milk. This decrease in ECM yield was due to lower DMI and OMD of the ration containing barley silage at early dough stage than of the ration including barley silage at the heading stage of maturity. In conclusion, spring barley and winter triticale appear to have the best feed values when chemical composition and digestibility are considered. When WCCS harvested at early dough stage is fed to dairy cows, milk production may decrease...|$|R
