A plane map is a planar map with a distinguished outside (“infinite”) face.

Previously we obtained formulae {{for the number}} of <b>unrooted</b> planar n-edge maps of various classes, including all maps, non-separable maps, eulerian maps and loopless maps.

40|$|Whereas {{biologists}} {{might think}} of rooted trees as the natural, or even the only, way to display phylogenetic relationships, {{this is not the}} case for a mathematician, to whom rooted and <b>unrooted</b> trees are graph-theoretical constructions that can be transformed easily into one another. An <b>unrooted</b> tree contains the same information as its rooted counterpart with the single exception that it does not tell you where the “evolutionary process ” started. Rooting a tree is often more of an art than a science, and a pressing problem in systematic biology is precisely the exact placement of a root. In addition, many phylogenetic algorithms in fact output <b>unrooted</b> trees that are rooted (artificially) in a subsequent step. From this, it is clear that finding an <b>unrooted</b> supertree or parent tree is of the same interest as it is for the rooted case. But, whereas a single <b>unrooted</b> tree can always be transformed into a rooted tree carrying the same information, this is no longer the case for collections of <b>unrooted</b> trees. Hence, the supertree problem for rooted trees is a special case of that for <b>unrooted</b> trees. As is often the case, this means that many things that can be done with rooted trees (the special case) are no longer valid for <b>unrooted</b> trees (the general case). In fact, the smallest possible example of a collection of <b>unrooted</b> trees that cannot be transformed into a collection of rooted trees is already sufficient to demonstrate that, unfortunately, many convenient features of the rooted supertree problem do not carry over to the <b>unrooted</b> supertree problem. On the positive side, if the set of input trees fulfills some minimality criterion, then there exists a simple set of conditions to check whether there is exactly one parent tree for this collection. In addition, the unique parent tree, should one exist, can be constructed quickly because the set of input trees always shows a certain “patchwork” structure...|$|R

40|$|The subtree prune-and-regraft (SPR) {{distance}} metric is {{a fundamental}} way of comparing evolutionary trees. It has wide-ranging applications, such as to study lateral genetic transfer, viral recombination, and Markov chain Monte Carlo phylogenetic inference. Although the rooted version of SPR distance can be computed relatively efficiently between rooted trees using fixed-parameter-tractable maximum agreement forest (MAF) algorithms, no MAF formulation is known for the <b>unrooted</b> case. Correspondingly, previous algorithms are unable to compute <b>unrooted</b> SPR distances larger than 7. In this paper, we substantially advance understanding of and computational algorithms for the <b>unrooted</b> SPR distance. First we identify four properties of optimal SPR paths, each of which suggests that no MAF formulation exists in the <b>unrooted</b> case. Then we introduce the replug distance, a new lower bound on the <b>unrooted</b> SPR distance that is amenable to MAF methods, and give an efficient fixed-parameter algorithm for calculating it. Finally, we develop a "progressive A*" search algorithm using multiple heuristics, including the TBR and replug distances, to exactly compute the <b>unrooted</b> SPR distance. Our algorithm is nearly two orders of magnitude faster than previous methods on small trees, and allows computation of <b>unrooted</b> SPR distances as large as 14 on trees with 50 leaves.

40|$|Phylogenetic {{networks}} are a generalization of phylogenetic trees {{that are used}} to represent reticulate evolution. <b>Unrooted</b> phylogenetic networks form a special class of such networks, which naturally generalize <b>unrooted</b> phylogenetic trees. In this paper we define two operations on <b>unrooted</b> phylogenetic networks, one of which is a generalization of the well-known nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI) operation on phylogenetic trees. We show that any <b>unrooted</b> phylogenetic network can be transformed into any other such network using only these operations. This generalizes the well-known fact that any phylogenetic tree can be transformed into any other such tree using only NNI operations. It also allows us to define a generalization of tree space and to define some new metrics on <b>unrooted</b> phylogenetic networks. To prove our main results, we employ some fascinating new connections between phylogenetic networks and cubic graphs that we have recently discovered. Our results should be useful in developing new strategies to search for optimal phylogenetic networks, a topic that has recently generated some interest in the literature, as well as for providing new ways to compare networks.
