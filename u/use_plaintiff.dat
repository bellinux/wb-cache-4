50|$|Plaintiff American Well Works Co. manufactured, sold, {{and held}} the patent to a {{particular}} type of pump, which was known to be the best on the market. The plaintiff sued defendant Layne & Bowler Co. on the grounds that defendant had maliciously libeled and slandered plaintiff's title to the pump by stating that the pump, and certain of its component parts, were infringements upon defendant's pump. Layne & Bowler had also filed lawsuits against others who <b>used</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> pump, and were threatening to sue all who used it.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} {{would be different}} if the defendant had mixed his own property {{with that of the}} plaintiff, for example, adding $50,000 of his own money to the $100,000 stolen from the plaintiff and buying a $150,000 house or <b>using</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> $100,000 to add a room to defendant's existing house. The constructive trust would still be available but in proportion to the contributions, not wholly in the claimant's favour. Alternatively, the claimant could elect for an equitable lien instead, which is like a mortgage over the asset to secure repayment.|$|R

50|$|Rei vindicatio is a {{legal action}} by which the {{plaintiff}} demands that the defendant return a thing that belongs to the plaintiff.

40|$|In U. S. law, the {{expression}} “secondary liability” is an umbrella term encompassing {{a number of}} different types of trademark infringement claims, but its essential meaning is that liability does not turn on the defendant itself <b>using</b> the <b>plaintiff’s</b> mark. Rather, in such cases, the defendant is held responsible for the infringements occasioned by a third party’s <b>use</b> of the <b>plaintiff’s</b> mark. Trademark owners might strategically prefer to bring a secondary liability claim instead of suing the third party infringer. A secondary infringement action may increase efficiency by allowing the mark owner to secure, in a single proceeding, relief against a party whose conduct is simultaneously enabling multiple acts of infringement by a number of primary infringers...|$|R
25|$|Probable {{cause is}} a {{relatively}} low standard of proof, which {{is used in the}} United States to determine whether a search, or an arrest, is warranted. It is also used by grand juries to determine whether to issue an indictment. In the civil context, this standard is often <b>used</b> where <b>plaintiffs</b> are seeking a prejudgement remedy.|$|R
40|$|Act Number 15 Year 2001 {{regarding}} Trademark has set {{the provisional}} charges. Provisional charges may be filed by the plaintiff while the investigation process of trademark infringement lawsuit in court of commerce is still ongoing. In a civil proceeding, the provisional charge must not be the primary charge, however the provisional charge that is {{set out in the}} Trademark Act has already concerned the primary charge. Actions that can be requested in the provisional charge according to Article 78 paragraph (1) in the Trademark Act include cessation of production, cessation of circulation of goods and / or services <b>using</b> <b>Plaintiffs</b> trademark illegally. <b>Using</b> literature study that utilizes primary legal materials and secondary legal materials as the research object, the results of the discussion are expected to be based on sufficient arguments to provide benefits for those who are interested to learn the trademark law enforcement...|$|R

50|$|WhenU, an {{advertising}} company developed {{a piece of}} advertising software called Save Now. When installed on a user's computer, Save Now would respond to a user's actions by generating pop-up advertisements. In particular, when a user browsed to a URL that WhenU possessed advertisements for, WhenU would open a window showing advertisements. Cases were filed against WhenU in 2003 by plaintiffs whose sites were found in WhenU's index. District Courts within the Sixth and Fourth Circuits ruled that WhenU's <b>use</b> of the <b>plaintiff's</b> trademarked URLs did not constitute a <b>use</b> of the <b>plaintiff's</b> trademarks because this use was restricted to the operation of WhenU's software.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of this}} eternity clause was {{to ensure that the}} establishment of any dictatorship in Germany would be clearly illegal; in legal practice the clause was <b>used</b> by <b>plaintiffs</b> at the Federal Constitutional Court challenging constitutional amendments that affected Articles 1, 10, 19, 101, and 103 regarding restrictions of legal recourse. Although these basic principles are protected from being repealed, their particular expression may still be amended; such as to clarify, extend or refine an entrenched principle.|$|R
50|$|The {{defendants}} appealed, {{arguing that}} there was no valid cause of action, since the <b>use</b> of the <b>plaintiff’s</b> image was not libellous, and since there was an absence of a common ﬁeld of activity on which to found an action in passing off.|$|R
50|$|The works {{used were}} {{unpublished}} and creative. However, since Netcom's {{use of the}} works was merely to facilitate their posting to the Usenet, which was an entirely different purpose than <b>plaintiff's</b> <b>use,</b> {{the nature of the}} works was not important to the fair use determination.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{to legal}} defense funds, legal {{financing}} companies provide money for lawsuits but {{are more often}} used by those without strong financial resources. Furthermore, legal financing {{is more likely to}} be <b>used</b> by <b>plaintiffs,</b> whereas legal defense funds are more likely to be used by defendants. Money obtained from legal financing companies can be used for any purpose, whether for litigation or for personal matters. On the other hand, money obtained through legal defense funds are solely used to fund litigation and legal costs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{common law}} of tort is an {{important}} tool for the resolution of environmental disputes that fall {{beyond the confines of}} regulated activity. Prior to the modern proliferation of environmental regulation, the doctrines of nuisance (public or private), trespass, negligence, and strict liability apportioned harm and assigned liability for activities that today would be considered pollution and likely governed by regulatory regimes. [...] These doctrines remain relevant, and most recently have been <b>used</b> by <b>plaintiffs</b> seeking to impose liability for the consequences of global climate change.|$|R

Howell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the suit, determining that McMillan lacked standing {{because he was not}} a candidate or registered voter in the District of Columbia, and determining that the matter was moot in any case because the slate had disbanded and [...] "demonstrated no intent to <b>use</b> the <b>plaintiff's</b> party's name in a future election." ...|$|R
5000|$|The court defined <b>Plaintiff’s</b> <b>use</b> of {{the theory}} of ‘initial {{interest}} of confusion’ as “confusion of ‘consumer attention, even though no actual sale is finally completed {{as a result of the}} confusion.” In order for this type confusion to be actionable under the Lanham Act, several factors must be reviewed: ...|$|R

5000|$|First, she {{rejected}} that sampling {{was a personal}} (rather than commercial) use. Sampling on Napster is not a personal use {{in the traditional sense}} that courts have recognized — copying which occurs within the household and does not confer any financial benefit on the user. See, e.g., Sony, 464 U.S. at 423, 449-50, 104 S.Ct. 774. Instead, sampling on Napster amounts to obtaining permanent copies of songs that users would otherwise have to purchase; it also carries the potential for viral distribution to millions of people. Defendant ignores critical differences between sampling songs on Napster and VCR usage in Sony. She also commented that, Even if the type of sampling supposedly done on Napster were a non-commercial <b>use,</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> have demonstrated a substantial likelihood that it would adversely affect the potential market for their copyrighted works if it became widespread. See Sony, 464 U.S. at 451, 104 S.Ct. 774. Plaintiffs claim three general types of harm: a decrease in retail sales, especially among college students; an obstacle to the record company plaintiffs' future entry into the digital downloading market; and a social devaluing of music stemming from its free distribution. ... Any potential enhancement of plaintiffs' sales due to sampling would not tip the fair use analysis conclusively in favor of defendant. Indeed, courts have rejected the suggestion that a positive impact on sales negates the copyright holder's entitlement to licensing fees or access to derivative markets.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, because Roulier {{was aware}} of the {{password}} protection of the profile and did not reconstruct his own MySpace friend list to contact DJs, the court ruled that Beatport (Roulier) had knowingly misappropriated the trade secret, citing the analysis used in Gates Rubber Co. v. Bando Chemical Indus. Ltd., 9 F.3d 823, 847 (10th Cir. 1993) -- that the defendant had a trade secret that was used without consent, and that the trade secret was obtained by improper means. The court also considered the public use of the trade secret, as Beatport had promoted itself <b>using</b> the <b>plaintiff's</b> MySpace profile, as grounds for Roulier's knowing of improper acquisition.|$|R
50|$|The Authors Guild, other author organizations, and {{individual}} authors {{claimed that the}} HathiTrust Digital Library had infringed their copyrights through its use of books scanned by Google. A federal court ruled against the plaintiffs in October 2012, finding that HathiTrust's use was permissible under fair <b>use.</b> The <b>plaintiffs</b> appealed the decision to the Second Circuit, and were rebuffed in 2014. In an opinion by Barrington Daniels Parker, Jr., the Second Circuit largely affirmed the lower court's findings of fair use for accessibility and search, remanding only to consider whether the plaintiffs had standing to sue about library preservation copies. The remaining claims were settled on January 6, 2015.|$|R
5000|$|After the lawsuit, PKWARE {{released}} {{one last}} {{version of its}} PKARC and PKXARC utilities under the new names [...] "PKPAK" [...] and [...] "PKUNPAK", {{and from then on}} concentrated on developing the separate programs PKZIP and PKUNZIP, which were based on new and different file compression techniques. However, following the renaming, SEA filed a lawsuit against PKWARE for contempt, for continually <b>using</b> the <b>plaintiff's</b> protected mark [...] "ARC" [...] by turning ARC from noun into verb in the PKPAK manual. The United States district court of the East District of Wisconsin ruled SEA's motion was denied, and the defendant was entitled to recover the legal cost of $500.|$|R

50|$|Nolle prosequi as a {{declaration}} {{is most often}} used in criminal cases, but in jurisdictions making use of nolle prosequi in civil lawsuits, is <b>used</b> by a <b>plaintiff</b> to voluntarily drop its claims.

5000|$|In old English law, [...] "continuando" [...] was a term <b>used</b> where a <b>plaintiff</b> would recover {{damages for}} several trespasses {{in the same}} action.

If the thing could not be recovered, the plaintiff could claim damages from the defendant {{with the aid of}} the condictio furtiva (a personal action). With the aid of the actio legis Aquiliae (a personal action), the plaintiff could claim damages from the defendant.

5000|$|Free Republic {{responded to}} the suit by raising an affirmative defense of fair <b>use.</b> The <b>plaintiffs</b> moved for partial summary {{adjudication}} on defendants' fair use defense on October 4, 1999, and cross-filed for summary judgment citing a First Amendment defense on October 19 under seal. Judge Margaret M. Morrow issued a preliminary ruling on November 8, 1999, rejecting the [...] "fair use" [...] argument. On April 4, 2000, Morrow issued an order granting partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs and denying the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
