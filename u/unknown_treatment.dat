40|$|PhDIt is well {{established}} that the 12 -lipoxygenase (12 -LOX) pathway of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism is stimulated within the myocardium by episodes of ischaemia, and there is considerable evidence showing that eicosanoids derived via this pathway protect against the damaging effects of myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Recent evidence suggests that transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV 1), expressed on sensory C-fibres, may play an important protective role against myocardial I/R injury; and in neurones, the 12 -LOX metabolite of AA 12 (S) -hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid [12 (S) -HpETE], has been proposed as an endogenous ligand for TRPV 1.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Major {{depression}} {{is among the}} most common clinical disorders in developed countries. While the mechanism of antidepressant action is <b>unknown,</b> <b>treatments</b> for depression appear to enhance neurotransmission by increasing extracellular levels of serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamin, 5 -HT) in the brain. Selective serotonin receptor antagonists are used to regulate the 5 -HT 1 family, 5 -HT 2 C and 5 -HT 7 receptors. The extensive design process and resultant activities of three serotonergic receptor antagonists for use in the treatment of depression will be presented. First, 8 -piperazinyl- 2, 3 -dihydropyrrolo[3, 2 -g]isoquinoline templates inhibit the 5 -HT 1 A, 1 B and 1 D receptors and subsequently limit the synthesis and release of 5 -HT from the nerve terminal 1. Two drug candidates, SB- 242084 and RS- 102221, potentiate the action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on 5 -HT 2 C levels, despite having little effect when added alone 2. Finally, the selective antagonist SB- 269970 exhibits promising antidepressant activity with the 5 -HT 7 receptors; however, SB- 656104 -A has better pharmacokinetic properties and is shown to regulate sleep patterns along with consistent antidepressant-like activity 3 - 5...|$|R
