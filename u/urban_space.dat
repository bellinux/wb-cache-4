5|$|In Johannesburg in the 1950s, {{crime was}} a day-to-day reality, and Sophiatown was {{the nucleus of}} all reef crimes. Gangsters were city-bred and spoke a mixture of Afrikaans and English, known as tsotsitaal. Some of the more {{well-known}} gangs in Sophiatown were the Russians, the Americans, the Gestapo, the Berliners and the Vultures. The names the Gestapo and the Berliners reflect their admiration for Hitler, whom they saw {{as some kind of}} hero, for taking on the whites of Europe. The best known gang from this period, and also best studied, was the Russians. They were a group of Basotho migrant workers who banded together {{in the absence of any}} effective law enforcement by either mine owners or the state. The primary goal of this gang was to protect members from the tsotsis and from other gangs of migrant workers, and to acquire and defend resources they found desirable - most notably women, jobs and the <b>urban</b> <b>space</b> necessary for the parties and staged fights that formed the bulk of their weekend entertainment.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to link {{economic}} value to <b>urban</b> green <b>spaces</b> to enhance the value of green <b>urban</b> <b>spaces,</b> along with the added benefit it can offer to the urban environment. Design/methodology/approach – As part of the VALUE project (Valuing Attractive Landscapes in the Urban Economy, made possible by INTERREG IVB North West Europe, European Regional Development Fund, European Territorial Cooperation, 2007 - 2013), this development approach was designed to enhance the planning of qualitative <b>urban</b> <b>spaces</b> by linking an economic value to green <b>urban</b> <b>spaces,</b> to enhance value and meaning. Findings – Based on case studies conducted in The Netherlands, the approach proves that by linking an economic value to green <b>urban</b> <b>spaces,</b> space is considered differently, authorities tend to prioritize these spaces and additional spinoffs realize. Research limitations/implications – The notion of green-value is subjective and differs between users, experts and between locations. Practical implications – The paper provides local authorities with a new approach to spatial planning, considering the economic value of green <b>urban</b> <b>spaces.</b> Social implications – The paper transforms the way in which green <b>urban</b> <b>spaces</b> are valued and planned; by realizing the intrinsic value of green <b>urban</b> <b>spaces,</b> in terms of social, environmental and economic benefit. Originality/value – The Value Added Planning approach stresses the need for qualitative planning processes that will enhance future economic value and sustainable development initiatives. The green environment is hard to quantify in terms of economic value, but it is this intrinsic value that can provide future benefit and sustainability in terms of place management and development...|$|R

25|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>space</b> is a {{precious}} commodity and public transport utilises it {{more efficiently than}} a car dominant society, allowing cities to be built more compactly than if they were dependent on automobile transport. If public transport planning {{is at the core}} of urban planning, it will also force cities to be built more compactly to create efficient feeds into the stations and stops of transport. This will at the same time allow the creation of centers around the hubs, serving passengers' daily commercial needs and public services. This approach significantly reduces urban sprawl.|$|E

40|$|Pedestrian <b>urban</b> <b>spaces</b> are, {{and have}} {{traditionally}} been analyzed from an historical, cultural, and physical point of view. Information from the various fields dealing with {{this area of the}} physical environment is extensive in depth and scope. However, the problem that confronts the designer is not one of a lack of descriptive information about pedestrian <b>urban</b> <b>spaces,</b> but the lack of a specific type of quantitative and qualitative information {{that can be used to}} evaluate a physical environment. In addition, the need exists to establish a technique in the form of a useful tool to aid the architect in designing successful pedestrian <b>urban</b> <b>spaces.</b> Viewing the above as a primary concern, this thesis has addressed itself to consideration of two major areas: First, the establishment of a framework for describing pedestrian <b>urban</b> <b>spaces.</b> This framework is in the form of a descriptive vocabulary defining pedestrian <b>urban</b> <b>spaces</b> according to their archetypes, physical elements, and physical attributes. Second, the presentation of an interdisciplinary framework. This is the Intersystem Congruence Model, which draws together in a compatible arrangement the diverse analytical and design methodologies employed by the disciplines of Behavioral Science and Architecture. This approach, if applied to the task of evaluating pedestrian <b>urban</b> <b>spaces</b> would give the designer an opportunity to set up and investigate many more alternative solutions than is now possible. In so doing, it requires a deeper understanding of the problem, presents a logical approach for evaluation, and offers a basis from which the architect can objectively argue his conclusion...|$|R
