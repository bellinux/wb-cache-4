5|$|In North America {{and most}} of Europe, voles predominate in the diet and shrews are {{the second most common}} food choice. Mice and rats form the main {{foodstuffs}} in the Mediterranean region, the tropics, sub-tropics and Australia. Barn owls are usually more specialist feeders in productive areas and generalists in drier areas. On the Cape Verde Islands, geckos are the mainstay of the diet, supplemented by birds such as plovers, godwits, turnstones, weavers and pratincoles, and on a rocky islet off the coast of California, a clutch of four young were being reared on a diet of Leach's storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa). In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the bank vole in the 1950s led to a major shift in the barn owl's diet: where their ranges overlap, the vole is now by far the largest prey item. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> up the single largest proportion of prey. In the United States, rodents and other small mammals <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> up ninety-five percent of the diet and worldwide, over ninety percent of the prey caught.|$|E
5|$|Twin helical strands {{form the}} DNA backbone. Another double helix {{may be found}} tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are {{adjacent}} to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22Å wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12Å wide. The width of the major groove means that {{the edges of the}} bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove. This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell (see below), but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.|$|E

It {{is useful to}} include of measure of moral norms to improve the predictive power of intentions to buy Fair Trade over the basic predictors, like attitude and perceived behavioral control.|$|E
25|$|Due to Hong Kong's unique {{historical}} background, Hong Kong Cantonese {{has evolved}} {{differently from the}} Mandarin spoken in China, Taiwan and Singapore over the years. Hong Kong Cantonese has developed a number of phrases and expressions that are unique to the context of Hong Kong. These phrases and expressions <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> references to specific things {{that can only be}} found in Hong Kong or specific incidents that happened in Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{have been documented}} that can help confirm the identify of this species. On the cap flesh, application of formaldehyde turns the tissue pinkish, iron salts result in a colour change to greyish-green, aniline causes a lavender to reddish-brown colour, and phenol a purplish pink to reddish brown. On the cap cuticle, nitric acid causes an orange-salmon colour, sulphuric acid creates orange-red, ammonia <b>usually</b> <b>makes</b> brown, and a potassium hydroxide solution <b>usually</b> <b>makes</b> orange.|$|R

25|$|Promotions are {{recommended}} by the Judging Division to the Board of Directors of the Japan Sumo Association. If it is a first promotion to the rank {{a member of the}} Board of Directors will formally visit the wrestler's stable to inform the new ōzeki of his promotion. The ōzeki will <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> a speech on this occasion, promising to do his best to uphold the dignity of the rank.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{have only}} one class of pigment cell, the {{mammalian}} equivalent of melanophores, to generate skin, hair, and eye colour. For this reason, and because the large number and contrasting colour of the cells <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> them very easy to visualise, melanophores {{are by far the}} most widely studied chromatophore. However, there are differences between the biology of melanophores and that of melanocytes. In addition to eumelanin, melanocytes can generate a yellow/red pigment called phaeomelanin.|$|E
25|$|Unlike pheromones, allomones {{harm the}} {{receiver}} at {{the benefit of}} the producer. This grouping encompasses the chemical arsenal that numerous insects employ. Insects with chemical weaponry <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> their presence known through aposematism. Aposematism is utilized by non-palatable species as a warning to predators that they represent a toxic danger. Additionally, these insects tend to be relatively large, long-lived, active, and frequently aggregate. Indeed, longer-lived insects {{are more likely to be}} chemically defended than short lived ones, as longevity increases apparency.|$|E

25|$|With {{glucocorticoid}} and mineralocorticoid replacement, {{these girls}} {{will reach the}} age of puberty. Because the ovaries are relatively inactive in fetal life and childhood, they sustain little damage from lipid accumulation during childhood. In the case of lipoid CAH due to StAR deficiency, when rising gonadotropin levels initiate puberty, despite the inefficiency of sex steroid synthesis, the ovaries will <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> enough estradiol to produce breast development, {{and in some cases}} even menarche, with menses continuing for some years. Ovarian and adrenal androgen production is minimal and produces little pubic or other body hair.|$|E
25|$|Cheating in {{computer}} games may involve cheat codes and hidden spots {{implemented by the}} game developers, modification of game code by third parties, or players exploiting a software glitch. Modifications are facilitated by either cheat cartridge hardware or a software trainer. Cheats <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> the game easier by providing an unlimited amount of some resource; for example weapons, health, or ammunition; or perhaps the ability to walk through walls. Other cheats might give access to otherwise unplayable levels or provide unusual or amusing features, like altered game colors or other graphical appearances.|$|E
25|$|FC Basel {{is known}} for having a big and loyal local following. When polls are {{conducted}} about the most passionate club football fans, FC Basel's fans <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> the top 200 if not top 100 in the world, resulting in what {{is by far the}} highest average attendance in Switzerland with around 30,000 fans attending every home game and with the new extension being built that number is expected to rise to around 40,000. The fans have also made themselves a name in numerous international matches in recent years.|$|E

25|$|Companies <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> a {{distinction}} between voluntary churn and involuntary churn. Voluntary churn occurs due to {{a decision by the}} customer to switch to another company or service provider, involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications, involuntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary churn, because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.|$|E
25|$|A modest ratings success, KITS {{fought off}} {{competition}} from the legendary AM CHR station, KFRC (which changed format to big bands in 1986), as well as KMEL-FM, which had switched from album-oriented rock to CHR in 1984. 105 KITS was, for a while, {{the darling of the}} Jet Set; daily visits were common from movie celebrities such as Bette Midler, Tom Cruise, Pat Morita, George Takei, Anthony Perkins and others. The celebs didn't <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> it on the air, but they toured the studios in San Francisco's Merchandise Mart just to see what the industry buzz was all about.|$|E
25|$|Ridership {{has been}} rising, and {{user-friendly}} features {{that have grown}} up through custom and practice help this. For instance, passengers open the doors by pressing a green strip on the central pole (in PCC trams) or an illuminated button (on Flexity trams), and drivers <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> a point of waiting for latecomers. However, overcrowding at rush hours and at weekend is common. The rate of detected fare-dodging is 4.15%, despite periodic enforcement campaigns, and this is being addressed by the installation of ticket barriers in all metro stations. From 2013, the obligation to check out of as well as into the system is being progressively introduced.|$|E

25|$|Chemicals {{are also}} used for sterilization. Heating {{provides}} a reliable way to rid objects of all transmissible agents, {{but it is not}} always appropriate if it will damage heat-sensitive materials such as biological materials, fiber optics, electronics, and many plastics. In these situations chemicals, either as gases or in liquid form, can be used as sterilants. While the use of gas and liquid chemical sterilants avoids the problem of heat damage, users must ensure that article to be sterilized is chemically compatible with the sterilant being used. In addition, the use of chemical sterilants poses new challenges for workplace safety, as the properties that make chemicals effective sterilants <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> them harmful to humans.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{men have}} most of the {{decision-making}} power in Ghanaian society. In labor and delivery, husbands and heads of the households also make most of the decisions {{in collaboration with the}} birth attendant, and sometimes a soothsayer. During labor, the husband will <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> the decision about where to deliver because a woman in labor is considered unable to think clearly due to the pain, although the head of the household will have the final say. In some cases, women, especially those who can afford to go to a hospital, will make their own decision about where to give birth without waiting for the approval of their husband or household heads.|$|E
25|$|Gouldian finches will <b>usually</b> <b>make</b> {{their nests}} in tree-holes, {{generally}} within a kilometer {{or so of}} water. They usually breed {{in the early part}} of the dry season, when there is plenty of food around. The male courtship dance is a fascinating spectacle. When a male is courting a female, he bobs about ruffling his feathers to show off his colors. He expands his chest and fluffs out his forehead feathers. After mating, a female lays a clutch of about 4–8 eggs. Both parents help brood the eggs during the daytime, and the female stays on the eggs at night. When the eggs hatch, both parents help care for the young. Gouldian finches leave the nest at between 19 and 23 days and are independent at 40 days old.|$|E
50|$|There is {{extensive}} {{debate as}} to whether gender-specific job titles are appropriate in a professional setting. This debate reflects the debate over gender-neutral language in general. The side for gender-neutral job titles <b>usually</b> <b>makes</b> an ideological argument, that gender-specific job titles at some level promote sexism in the workplace. The side for the more traditional, gender-specific terms <b>usually</b> <b>makes</b> a practical argument, that replacing the historical terms everywhere they appear (in documents, etc.) would be difficult and expensive, or that it is unnecessary. However, there are many (in particular feminists) who would claim that this argument is really a backlash against the argument for gender-neutral language.|$|R
50|$|Strabismus, {{especially}} esophoria or exophoria, {{interferes with}} normal eye contact: a person whose eyes are not aligned <b>usually</b> <b>makes</b> full {{eye contact with}} one eye only, while {{the orientation of the}} other eye deviates slightly or more.|$|R
