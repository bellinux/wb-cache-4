Representative Tom DeLay introduced H.R. 2589, the [...] "Workers' Political Rights Act of 1989," [...] on June 8, 1989. The bill, which died in committee, would have amended the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to: 1) Add <b>union</b> political committees <b>to</b> the list of political action committees regulated by the Federal Election Commission; 2) Require <b>unions</b> <b>to</b> give each worker separate, yearly Beck notices; 3) Require <b>unions</b> <b>to</b> give each worker Beck notices when they join the union and when they resign from the union; 4) Require <b>unions</b> <b>to</b> undergo independent audits each year to verify the calculation of agency fees; and 5) Require <b>unions</b> <b>to</b> provide members detailed information on the calculation of agency fees.|$|R

5|$|A light novel titled Shikamaru Hiden: A Cloud Drifting in Silent Darkness, {{written by}} Takashi Yano and {{illustrated}} by Kishimoto, stars Shikamaru as the main character and narrator. The novel is set {{two years after the}} Fourth Ninja War, focusing on Shikamaru's assignment as organizer of the newly formed Shinobi <b>Union</b> <b>to</b> capture a rogue ninja who rules over the distant Land of Silence and attempts to establish a new world order ruled by the common people. It also explores his growing relationship with Temari, culminating in him struggling to name his child with her, {{years after the end of}} the novel.|$|E
5|$|After Abraham Lincoln's {{election}} as president, several Southern states announced their secession from the <b>Union</b> <b>to</b> {{form a new}} government, the Confederate States of America. Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort, which he regarded as a holy crusade against the Slave Power. In April 1861, the rebels bombarded Fort Sumter, {{one of the last}} federal outposts in the South, beginning the Civil War. Although he had no military training, Garfield knew that his place was in the Union Army.|$|E
5|$|After the Gdańsk Agreement, the Polish {{government}} was under increasing {{pressure from the}} Soviet <b>Union</b> <b>to</b> take action and strengthen its position. Stanisław Kania was viewed by Moscow as too independent, and on October 18, 1981, the Party Central Committee {{put him in the}} minority. Kania lost his post as First Secretary, and was replaced by Prime Minister (and Minister of Defence) Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who adopted a strong-arm policy.|$|E
2500|$|One {{explanation}} for loss {{of public support}} is simply the lack of union power or critical mass.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War and the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia and the Central Asian republics were {{weakened}} {{economically and}} faced declines in GDP. Post-Soviet states underwent economic reforms and privatisation. The process of Eurasian integration began immediately after the break-up of the Soviet <b>Union</b> <b>to</b> salvage economic ties with Post-Soviet states through the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States on 8 December 1991 by the presidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia.|$|E
5|$|As {{the tour}} {{occurred}} before the 1895 schism of rugby football—where many northern English rugby clubs left the Rugby Football <b>Union</b> <b>to</b> form the Northern Union—many of the team's {{opponents in the}} British Isles later elected to play rugby league rather than rugby union. The links in the tables below link to those clubs regardless of what code they subsequently played.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its high}} {{resistance}} to P.cinnamomi dieback, the feasibility of using B.integrifolia as a rootstock for susceptible Banksia species in the cut flower trade is under investigation. Presently, the success rate for grafting is only 30–40%, and even with successful grafts {{there is a tendency}} for the <b>union</b> <b>to</b> fail under stress. More research is needed before the technique will be ready for commercial use.|$|E

5|$|Boot {{was born}} in Moscow. His parents, both Russian Jews, later emigrated from the Soviet <b>Union</b> <b>to</b> Los Angeles, where he was raised. Max Boot was educated at the University of California, Berkeley (BA, History, 1991) and Yale University (MA, Diplomatic History, 1992). He started his journalistic career writing columns for the Berkeley student {{newspaper}} The Daily Californian. He later stated that he believes {{he is the only}} conservative writer in that paper's history. Boot and his family currently live in the New York area.|$|E
5|$|During the pre-series period, two {{observers}} of the opposing team were allowed to scout the teams. Toronto Maple Leafs' coach John McLellan and Bob Davidson, the Leafs' head scout went to the Soviet <b>Union</b> <b>to</b> observe the Soviets in the Sovietsky Sport tournament. McLellan and Davidson observed two games, while Kulagin, along with Arkadi Chernyshev, a former assistant to Tarasov, observed all of the Canadians' practices in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Greece and Turkey {{also joined}} the {{alliance}} in 1952, forcing {{a series of}} controversial negotiations, in which the United States and Britain were the primary disputants, over how to bring the two countries into the military command structure. While this overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European <b>Union</b> <b>to</b> continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including Operation Gladio, were transferred to NATO control. Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery.|$|E

5|$|ICAO {{had only}} one {{experience}} of investigation of an air disaster prior to the KAL007 shootdown. This was the incident of February 21, 1973, when Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114 was shot down by Israeli F-4 jets over the Sinai Peninsula. ICAO convention required the state in whose territory the accident had taken place (the Soviet <b>Union)</b> <b>to</b> conduct an investigation together with the country of registration (South Korea), the country whose air traffic control the aircraft was flying under (Japan), {{as well as the}} aircraft's manufacturer (Boeing).|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} shootdown, South Korea, {{owner of the}} {{aircraft}} and therefore prime considerant for jurisdiction, designated the United States and Japan as search and salvage agents, thereby making it illegal for the Soviet <b>Union</b> <b>to</b> salvage the aircraft, providing it was found outside Soviet territorial waters. If it did so, the United States would now be legally entitled to use force against the Soviets, if necessary, to prevent retrieval of {{any part of the}} plane.|$|E

President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000.
