25|$|The Tiverton line {{joined the}} D at Morebath Junction but its trains {{continued}} to Dulverton, the next station towards Barnstaple. A small, <b>unstaffed</b> <b>station</b> was {{opened at the}} junction on 1 December 1928. Trains on both lines called there, so it had a more frequent service than at Morebath station, and the halt was much nearer the village, but could be reached only by an often muddy footpath across fields.|$|E
2500|$|The depot {{building}} {{burned down}} on March 24, 1933. The O did not rebuild it (although {{it continued to}} use the stop for freight operations) and got permission on June 5, 1939, from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to convert it to an <b>unstaffed</b> <b>station.</b> It was finally abandoned in 1957 after the O went bankrupt, and this event largely {{marked the end of}} Orson's notability outside of its contiguity. Many of the village's business establishments closed soon after the railroad did, with the notable exception of the summer camps that would gradually come to replace the railroad as Orson's main source of supra-regional prominence. The first of these was Camp Nehantic, a Jewish girls’ camp that was founded in 1919 by Harry Davidson and his wife, and that had originally been located on Crescent Beach in Niantic, Connecticut. Between 1925 and 1926, Nehantic moved to the western bank of Independent Lake, in Orson, and soon became {{an important part of the}} community's economy. In 1931, the camp was bought by J.A. Wells, and then, between 1936 and 1937, it closed and was replaced in 1937 by Camps Carmelia and Keeyumah, twin Jewish camps for girls and boys, respectively. These two had both opened around 1928 on the banks of Lake Champlain in Milton, Vermont (at least one source says they were located in Oneonta, New York, and refers to the boys' camp as [...] "Keeyuma"). The two camps shared facilities and operated in concert with each other until 1948, when they were consolidated into one coeducational, Jewish camp that seems to have been administratively distinct from them, but was nevertheless also called Camp Keeyumah. This Keeyumah was open until 1979.|$|E
