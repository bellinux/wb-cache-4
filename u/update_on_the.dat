25|$|Jack Taylor's sister, Donna Taylor, {{recalled}} the Police coming round {{to inform the}} family they had discovered his body. She reported them simply, brashly stating 'Jack's dead', and going on to explain they found a syringe in his pocket, white powder in his wallet and needle marks on his arm. Donna was unhappy with this revelation, claiming that Jack was very anti-drugs. 11 days after Jack's death, Donna and her sister Jen contacted Barking Dagenham Police to get an <b>update</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> investigation, and were astonished {{to find out that}} there was not an investigation taking place, and Police were satisfied with the theory that Jack had sat down by himself and overdosed on drugs.|$|E
25|$|A major {{international}} scientific study released in November 2006 {{in the journal}} Science found that about one-third of all fishing stocks worldwide have collapsed (with a collapse being defined as a decline to less than 10% of their maximum observed abundance), and that if current trends continue all fish stocks worldwide will collapse within fifty years. In July 2009, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University, {{the author of the}} November 2006 study in Science, co-authored an <b>update</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> state of the world's fisheries with one of the original study's critics, Ray Hilborn of the University of Washington at Seattle.

25|$|In two books, <b>Update</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Aryan Invasion Debate (1999) and Asterisk in Bhāropīyasthān (2007), Elst {{has written}} {{in support of}} Out of India, a fringe theory that argues against the academically {{accepted}} view that Indo-Aryan migrations into India in the second millennium BCE brought a proto-Indo-European language with them. Elst argues that the migration went {{the other way and}} that Aryans indigenous to India migrated out of India, taking Indo-European languages to the Middle East and Europe. Elst {{is one of the few}} supporters who uses paleolinguistics in support of the Out of India theory. The Out of India theory is considered to be an extreme view of the origin of the Indo-European family of languages and Elst is thought to be one of its leading proponents.|$|E

25|$|Saturday, {{on the eve}} of the game, NFL {{commissioner}} Pete Rozelle called Jim Kensil and Don Weiss, {{the executive}} directors of the NFL, for an <b>update</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> weather conditions. It is suspected that they informed him that Sunday's game time temperature of about 5° was playable. Rozelle, who in June 1966 had seen to it that the AFL-NFL Championship game would always be in a warm weather city, inquired if the game could be postponed until Monday. Predictions held Monday would be even colder than Sunday and the game was not postponed. Little did they know that the cold front would be far colder and would arrive much sooner than expected. The Packers, who had for years eschewed late-season home games because of the cold winters, would play host to the Cowboys in a game that would mark the coldest New Year's Eve in the history of Green Bay and the coldest title game in the history of the NFL, a record that still stands.|$|E
25|$|An <b>update</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> above study; {{it employs}} the same methodology, has {{a larger sample}} (20,055 {{respondent}}s), and a broader respondent age range (16–69). The study found that 96.5% of the entire sample (or 96.8% {{of the men and}} 96.3% of the women) identified as heterosexual, a drop from the 2003 findings (97.5%). Homosexuals accounted for 1.9% of the male population and 1.2% of the female population, a non-significant difference between the sexes. Bisexuals accounted for 1.3% of the male population and 2.2% of the female population. Women were significantly {{more likely than men to}} identify as bisexual, and less likely to report exclusively other-sex or same-sex attraction and experience. Similarly, more women reported same-sex experience and same-sex attraction. Nine percent of men and 19% of women had some history of same-sex attraction or experience. More women identified as lesbian or bisexual than in 2001–02. Homosexual/gay identity was more common among men with university education and living in cities, and much less common among men with blue-collar jobs. Both male and female bisexuality were more common among respondents under the age of 20. Male bisexuality was also overrepresented among men in their sixties.|$|E

500|$|Tilghman {{realized}} that {{it was only a matter}} of time before Fort Henry fell. Only nine guns remained above the water to mount a defense. While leaving artillery in the fort to hold off the Union gunboats, he ordered the majority of his force to march, under the command of Col. Adolphus Heiman, on the overland route to Fort Donelson, 12 miles (19km) away. Fort Heiman was abandoned on February 4, and all but a handful of artillerymen left Fort Henry on February 5. (Union cavalry pursued the retreating Confederates, but poor road conditions prevented any serious confrontation and they took few captives.) Tilghman, as was his custom, spent the night of February 56 on the steamer Dunbar, [...] upstream from the fort.
