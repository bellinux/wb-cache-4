Prevention and reduction of <b>unwanted</b> <b>sound,</b> from tape hiss to squeaking bass drum pedals, is important in many musical pursuits, but noise is also used creatively in many ways, and in some way in nearly all genres.|$|R

40|$|An {{acoustic}} environment contains sounds from various sound sources, some generally perceived as wanted, others as unwanted. This thesis examines {{the effects of}} wanted and <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> in {{acoustic environment}}s, with regard to masking, stress recovery, and speech intelligibility. In urban settings, masking of <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> by sounds from water structures has been suggested {{as a way to}} improve the acoustic environment. However, Study I showed that the <b>unwanted</b> (road traffic) <b>sound</b> was better at masking the wanted (water) sound than vice versa, thus indicating that masking of <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> with sounds from water structures may prove difficult. Also, predictions by a partial loudness model of the auditory periphery overestimated the effect of masking, indicating that centrally located informational masking processes contribute to the effect. Some environments have also been shown to impair stress recovery; however studies using only auditory stimuli is lacking. Study II showed that a wanted (nature) sound improve stress recovery compared to unwanted (road traffic, ambient) sounds. This suggests that the acoustic environment influences stress recovery and that wanted sounds may facilitate stress recovery compared to <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds.</b> An additional effect of <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> is impeded speech communication, commonly measured with speech intelligibility models. Study III showed that speech intelligibility starts to be negatively affected when the <b>unwanted</b> (aircraft <b>sound)</b> masker have equal or higher sound pressure level as the speech sound. Three models of speech intelligibility (speech intelligibility index, partial loudness and signal–to–noise ratio) predicted this effect well, with a slight disadvantage for the signal–to–noise ratio model. Together, Study I and III suggests that the partial loudness model is useful for determining effects of wanted and <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> in outdoor acoustic environments where variations in sound pressure level are large. But, in environments with large variations in other sound characteristics, models containing predictions of central processes would likely produce better results. The thesis concludes that wanted and <b>unwanted</b> characteristics of <b>sounds</b> in acoustic environments affect masking, stress recovery, and speech intelligibility, and that auditory perception models can predict these effects.

Instead, through the development of an ‘ethico-affective’ approach, this book aims to account for a broader spectrum of noise, ranging from the exceptional to the banal; the overwhelming to the inaudible; and the destructive to the generative. What connects these various and variable manifestations of noise is not negativity but affectivity – the capacity to modulate, transform and perturb.

50|$|Sound masking is the {{addition}} of sound created by special digital generators and distributed by normally unseen speakers through an area to reduce distractions or provide confidentiality where needed. The sound is broad band random that conveys no information about itself to a listener.

Masking operates by covering up or masking <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds,</b> similar to perfume that covers up other odors.

50|$|A noise-cancellation speaker may be {{co-located}} {{with the}} sound source to be attenuated.

This requires a much lower power level for cancellation but is effective only for a single user. Noise cancellation at other locations is more difficult as the three-dimensional wavefronts of the <b>unwanted</b> <b>sound</b> and the cancellation signal could match and create alternating zones of constructive and destructive interference, reducing noise in some spots while doubling noise in others.

To apply this algorithm to the real <b>sound</b> <b>signals,</b> here I propose that non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) applied to the spectrograms of <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> would successfully give a set of sound dictionary elements. When NMF was applied to solo-music signals with an appropriate value for the rank of factorization, it could extract instrument-specific patterns of basis spectrograms, each of which has a peak frequency for different notes. Interestingly, the <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> converted back from the obtained basis spectrograms sounded more or less like the corresponding instrument, which suggests that the obtained basis spectrograms, or basis sound elements, would be a good candidate for the sound dictionary. When NMF was applied to <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> played with several different instruments, the obtained basis sound elements can be categorized into each instrument-specific pattern by hand. In addition, using the categorized elements, <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> can be reconstructed corresponding to each instrument part of the original music.
