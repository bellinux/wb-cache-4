5|$|Media {{reports said}} the attack struck {{at the heart}} of American covert {{operations}} in the region, with some characterizing it as the CIA's Pearl Harbor. It raised doubts about the reliability of the Afghan forces that are being trained by the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies,</b> and on the practicality of Western exit strategies that involve training the Afghan army and policy with the aim of enabling them to fight the Taliban on their own.|$|E
5|$|The Act was {{subsequently}} amended to promote private development {{of nuclear energy}} under the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program in 1954. In restricting the access to nuclear information to other countries, it created a rift between the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies,</b> particularly Britain and Canada, which {{had participated in the}} Manhattan Project. This resulted in cumbersome command and control arrangements, and in Britain developing its own nuclear weapons. The Act was amended in 1958 to allow the United States to share information with its close allies.|$|E

25|$|In June, the Korean War {{broke out}} between {{communist}} North Korea (DPRK) supported by China and the Soviet Union, and South Korea (ROK) {{supported by the}} <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> in the UN. The Cold War was turning 'hot' in East Asia, and the American government feared communist domination of the entire region would have deep implications for American interests. The US became strongly opposed {{to the government of}} Ho Chi Minh, in part, because it was supported and supplied by China.|$|E

A 2004 attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta by Jemaah Islamiyah resulted in the deaths of nine Indonesians. The following year, Indonesian diplomatic and consular premises in Australia received a number of hoax and threat messages. Since then, both the United States and Australian governments have issued warnings against travel to Indonesia, advising their citizens of a continued risk of attacks.|$|E

Puerto Ricans have continued to fight in every conflict in which the United States has been involved, among which are the Vietnam War in which four Puerto Ricans were awarded the Medal of Honor, Operation El Dorado Canyon, Operation Desert Shield, Operation Restore Hope, Operation Desert Storm and in the military campaigns of Afghanistan and Iraq, in what the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> refer to as the War on Terror.|$|E
25|$|Cambodia's {{relations}} with China {{were based on}} mutual interests. Sihanouk hoped that China would restrain the Vietnamese and the Thai from acting to Cambodia's detriment. The Chinese, in turn, viewed Cambodia's nonalignment as vital {{in order to prevent}} the encirclement of their country by the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies.</b> When Premier Zhou Enlai visited Phnom Penh in 1956, he asked the country's Chinese minority, numbering about 300,000, to cooperate in Cambodia's development, to stay out of politics, and to consider adopting Cambodian citizenship. This gesture helped to resolve a sensitive issue—the loyalty of Cambodian Chinese—that had troubled the relationship between Phnom Penh and Beijing. In 1960 the two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship and Nonaggression. After the Sino-Soviet rift Sihanouk's ardent friendship with China contributed to generally cooler ties with Moscow.|$|E
25|$|Hayashi {{helped found}} the JSC and the JSDF after Japan regained {{its status as a}} {{sovereign}} state under the Treaty of San Francisco in 1954. As Chairman of JSC, he assisted the Director-General of Japanese Defense Agency (JDA) in formulating defense plans, reviewing proposals as submitted by the JSDF, carrying out defense-related intelligence and investigation work, as well as fostering closer military ties with the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies.</b> Having served in the JSC for ten years, he was not only the longest-serving Chairman, but was also the only Chairman with civilian civil service background. In retirement, he took an active part in public affairs, serving as, among others, President of the Japan Housing Corporation from 1965 to 1971, of the Japanese Red Cross from 1978 to 1987, and of the Japan Good Deeds Association from 1983 to 1990.|$|E

25|$|In March 2012, Epic Games {{partnered with}} Virtual Heroes of Applied Research Associates to launch Unreal Government Network, {{a program that}} handles Unreal Engine 3 {{licenses}} for government agencies. With this support agreement, Virtual Heroes was able to license the technology to the departments, agencies and units of the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> across multiple platforms. Epic also revealed that several UGN projects were already underway, including an Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) contract for Virtual Heroes to design serious games with the aim to help intelligence analysts tackle instinctual biases that might colour their findings, an anaesthesiology training application for U.S Army physicians, and a multiplayer crime scene training simulation developed by the FBI Academy. Additionally, Epic's tech was also being used by a top five defense contractor and a national laboratory for custom-made model integrations and visualization. Later in December, defense IT and software firm IPKeys Technologies licensed the third version of the engine for development of I-GAME, a tool intended to train tactics and techniques in regards to Counter-IEDs.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the victorious}} Allies of the Second World War (locally {{known as the}} Second Sino-Japanese War), the Republic of China (ROC) joined the UN at its {{founding}} in 1945. The subsequent resumption of the Chinese Civil War led {{to the establishment of}} the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. Nearly all of mainland China was soon under its control and the ROC fled to the island of Taiwan. The One-China policy advocated by both governments precluded dual representation but, amid the Cold and Korean wars, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>allies</b> opposed the replacement of the ROC at the United Nations, although they were persuaded to pressure the government of the ROC to accept international recognition of Mongolia's independence in 1961. The United Kingdom, France, and other American allies individually shifted their recognitions of China to the PRC and Albania brought annual votes to replace the ROC with the PRC, but these were defeated since—after General Assembly Resolution 1668—a change in recognition required a two-thirds vote.|$|E

[...] Seizing the strategic initiative, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>Allies</b> landed on Guadalcanal in the southern Solomon Islands in August 1942, beginning the Solomon Islands Campaign. [...] The battle for Guadalcanal ended in victory for the Allies with the withdrawal of Japanese forces from the island in early February 1943. [...] At the same time, Australian [...] and American forces in New Guinea repulsed the Japanese land offensive along the Kokoda Track. Going on the offensive, the Allied forces captured Buna–Gona, destroying Japanese forces in that area.|$|E
