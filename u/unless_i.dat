5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unless</b> <b>I</b> am {{convinced}} by {{the testimony of}} the Scriptures or by clear reason (for I do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone, since {{it is well known that}} they have often erred and contradicted themselves), I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and will not recant anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. May God help me. Amen.|$|E
500|$|In July, Allenby was {{hopeful that}} T. E. Lawrence and the Sherifial Arab force could support a September {{attack by the}} EEF, {{recognising}} that harvests were being collected before that time, and that {{after the end of}} September they normally moved to camel-grazing lands in the Syrian desert. He wrote, [...] "They, naturally, won't and can't do much <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> move; and it is not much use their destroying the Turks' communications <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> take immediate advantage of such destruction...If I bring them into the fight and do not make progress myself, this will also expose them to retaliationwhich to some tribes, such as the Druzes, S. of Damascus, may mean annihilation." [...] The EEF encouraged the Bedouin to defect: ...|$|E

500|$|Roche {{is perhaps}} best known for once excusing an absence in Parliament thus: [...] "Mr. Speaker, it is {{impossible}} I could have been in two places at once, <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> were a bird." [...] This quotation was referenced by Ambrose Bierce in The Devil's Dictionary in his definition of ubiquity: ...|$|E
500|$|Conservative MP {{and animal}} lover Alan Clark was {{suspicious}} {{about the way}} Humphrey's retirement was announced and demanded proof that the cat was still alive: [...] "Humphrey is now a missing person. <b>Unless</b> <b>I</b> hear from him or he makes a public appearance, I suspect he has been shot." [...] This led to rumours that Humphrey had been put down on the orders of Mrs Blair.|$|E
500|$|Harvey has one older brother, Saul, {{and four}} nephews through him. She said in 1995 {{that she would}} love to have children, stating: [...] "I wouldn't {{consider}} it <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> was married. I would have to meet someone that I wanted {{to spend the rest of}} my life with. That's the only person who I would want to be the father of my children. Maybe that will never happen. I obviously see it in a very rational way but I'd love to have children." ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{recorded}} at Sear Sound in New York using two vintage Telefunken ELA M 251 E mics into a Forsell Technologies FetCode preamp. Most of it {{was recorded}} onto the same Studer 1" [...] two-track {{that was used to}} mix Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band! Everything was tracked live, and I’ve decided never to record wearing headphones again <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> absolutely have to. Wearing headphones is bullshit, because you’re in your own little world playing to a mix that no one will ever hear but you. What’s the point? ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout his {{sporting}} career, Bain {{also earned}} medals in lacrosse and snowshoeing. He was the Canadian trapshooting champion in 1903. An avid figure skater {{throughout much of}} his life, Bain won over a dozen titles, the last of which came {{at the age of}} 56, and he continued to skate until the age of 70; he remained a competitive athlete until 1930. On his skill in a variety of sports, Bain once said that [...] "I couldn't see any sense in participating in a game <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> was good. I kept at a sport just long enough to nab a championship, then I'd try something else." ...|$|E
500|$|In contrast, {{the offices}} of Capitol Pictures and Lipnick's house are pristine, lavishly decorated, and {{extremely}} comfortable. The company's rooms are bathed in sunlight, and Ben Geisler's office faces a lush array of flora. Barton meets Lipnick in one scene beside an enormous, spotless swimming pool. This echoes his position as studio head, as he explains: [...] "...you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town... if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be {{within a mile of}} this pool– [...] <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> was cleaning it." [...] In his office, Lipnick showcases another trophy of his power: statues of Atlas, the Titan of Greek mythology who declared war on the gods of Mount Olympus and was severely punished.|$|E

6000|$|Varney looked {{round the}} presence-chamber, his eye {{travelling}} from one lady to another, until at length it rested upon the Queen herself, {{but with an}} aspect of the deepest veneration. [...] "I see no tresses," [...] he said, [...] "in this presence, worthy of such similies, <b>unless</b> where <b>I</b> dare not look on them." ...|$|R
500|$|It {{was during}} this Australian season, during a match in Brisbane, that Jackson was {{introduced}} to Phyllis Thomas, a trained ballet dancer, who later became his fiancée. In March 1931, Jackson felt his health had recovered sufficiently to join an exhibition tour of Far North Queensland, led by Alan Kippax. He found the tour exhausting, with arduous travel and damp weather, but played well enough to top the aggregate with over 1,100 runs {{at an average of}} 93.00. In a letter to his childhood friend and New South Wales team-mate, Bill Hunt, he wrote, [...] "Our tour of North Queensland has now concluded and thank goodness! ... I would never make this trip again <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> was guaranteed ₤100, and that's not enough!" ...|$|E
500|$|After a {{thorough}} pre-flight check I would take off and, once at circuit height, I would trim the aircraft {{and try to}} get her to fly straight and level with hands off the stick... Once the trim was satisfactory I would take the Spitfire up in a full-throttle climb at 2,850rpm to the rated altitude of one or both supercharger blowers. Then I would make a careful check of the power output from the engine, calibrated for height and temperature... If all appeared satisfactory I would then put her into a dive at full power and 3,000rpm, and trim her to fly hands and feet off at [...] IAS (Indicated Air Speed). Personally, I never cleared a Spitfire <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> had carried out a few aerobatic tests to determine how good or bad she was.|$|E
500|$|The word θέλημα (thelema) {{is rare in}} {{classical}} Greek, where it [...] "signifies the appetitive will: desire, sometimes even sexual", but it is frequent in the Septuagint. Early Christian writings occasionally use the word {{to refer to the}} human will, and even the will of God's opponent, the Devil, but it usually refers to the will of God. [...] One well-known example is in the [...] "Lord's Prayer" [...] (...) , “Thy kingdom come. Thy will (Θελημα) be done, On earth as it is in heaven.” It is used later in the same gospel (...) , [...] "He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, [...] "My Father, if this cannot pass away <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> drink it, Thy will be done." [...] In his 5th-century Sermon on , Augustine of Hippo gave a similar instruction: [...] "Love, and what thou wilt, do." [...] (Dilige et quod vis fac).|$|E

500|$|During one scene, Ron says, [...] "I won't {{publicly}} {{endorse a}} product <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> use it exclusively and I {{really believe in}} it. My only official recommendations are US Army issued mustache trimmers, Morton's Salt, and the C.R. Lawrence fine two inch style oscillating knife blade." [...] That line was written by Schur, and the scene used in the episode was Nick Offerman's first take, with no mistakes made with the complicated dialogue. Immediately after [...] "The Fight" [...] first aired, a [...] "Producer's Cut" [...] version was made available on the official NBC.com website. It included an additional four minutes of material, that include a previously-unaired cold open in which Ron sternly demands to know which employee has broken the parks department's coffee machine; this prompts a fight as the staff make accusations against each other. Ron secretly reveals to the camera that he broke the machine himself, but questioned the other employees anyway to deliberately start the arguments.|$|E
500|$|However, Behan {{found he}} could not {{concentrate}} on his art in Germany as he was working too hard in the evenings in nightclubs and bars to earn money. Also, as he was doing [...] "too much drinking as well, so <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to start a}} new art style where it would've been very 'shakey' [...] to look at, basically I decided I had to do something else". He resolved to go to London to study acting. After applying to three drama schools he was accepted by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). For about three years from 1990 or 1991, he lived with his friends from RADA, David Harewood and Danny Cerqueira, at 39 Ravenshaw Street in West Hampstead. Harewood recalls that his housemates were [...] "fantastic characters" [...] – [...] "It was a wonderful, experimental time. We'd spend long nights discussing art, life and politics; smoking weed, drinking lots of whisky, listening to music and throwing furniture on the fire." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers from The San Francisco Chronicle and The Boston Globe {{commented on}} Azaria's [...] "overacting" [...] {{in the role}} of Gargamel. More {{positive}} reaction came from Scott Bowles of USA Today called Azaria the [...] "human standout"; Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt he suffered the [...] "greatest disservice" [...] of the film's cast due to a poor script. Azaria noted in an interview with The A.V. Club that The Smurfs and Night at the Museum were films he agreed to do primarily for the money, but that [...] "I won't even do that <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> think it will at least be fun to do...I really try to throw myself into it, figure out the funniest, cleverest way to get the material over, and make it fun to do and fun to watch." [...] Azaria reprised his role in the 2013 sequel The Smurfs 2. Azaria is set to star in [...] with Richard Gere.|$|E
6000|$|Father Brown blinked {{even more}} painfully than before; then he stammered: [...] "Really, my lord, <b>I</b> don't know <b>unless</b> it's because <b>I</b> don't {{look at it}} so often." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{day after}} the election, Romney {{returned}} to Bain Capital, but the loss had a lasting effect; he told his brother, [...] "I never want to run for something again <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> can win." [...] When his father died in 1995, Mitt donated his inheritance to BYU's George W. Romney Institute of Public Management. He also became vice-chair of the Board of the Points of Light Foundation, which had embraced his father's National Volunteer Center. Romney felt restless as the decade neared a close; the goal of simply making more money held little attraction for him. Although no longer in a local leadership position in his church, he still taught Sunday School. During the long and controversial approval and construction process for the $30million Mormon temple in Belmont, he feared that, as a political figure who had opposed Kennedy, he would become {{a focal point for}} opposition to the structure. He thus kept to a limited, behind-the-scenes role in attempts to ease tensions between the church and local residents.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton {{returned}} to Britain from the Endurance expedition in late May 1917, while World War I was under way. Many {{of his men}} enlisted promptly upon their return. [...] Too old to enlist, Shackleton nevertheless sought {{an active role in}} the war effort, and eventually departed for Murmansk with the temporary army rank of major, as part of a military mission to North Russia. Shackleton expressed his dissatisfaction with this role in letters home: [...] "I feel I am no use to anyone <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> am outfacing the storm in wild lands." [...] He {{returned to}} England in February 1919 and began plans to set up a company that would, with the cooperation of the North Russian Government, develop the natural resources of the region. This scheme came to nothing, as the Red Army took control of that part of Russia during the Russian Civil War; to provide himself with an income, Shackleton had to rely on the lecture circuit. During the winter of 1919–20 he lectured twice a day, six days a week, for five months.|$|E
500|$|Eddie Van Halen, lead guitarist of {{hard rock}} band Van Halen, {{was asked to}} add a guitar solo. When {{initially}} contacted by Jones, Van Halen thought he was receiving a prank call. Having established that the call was genuine, Van Halen borrowed an amplifier from guitarist Allan Holdsworth and recorded his guitar solo free of any charge. [...] "I did it as a favor", the musician later said. [...] "I was a complete fool, according {{to the rest of}} the band, our manager and everyone else. I was not used. I knew what I was doing – I don't do something <b>unless</b> <b>I</b> want to do it." [...] Van Halen recorded his contribution following Jones and Jackson arriving at the guitarist's house with a [...] "skeleton version" [...] of the song. Fellow guitarist Steve Lukather recalled, [...] "Initially, we rocked it out as Eddie had played a good solo—but Quincy thought it was too tough. So I had to reduce the distorted guitar sound and that is what was released." [...] The song was among the last four completed for Thriller; the others were [...] "Human Nature", [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)" [...] and [...] "The Lady in My Life".|$|E
6000|$|The dogs now brushed {{into the}} cover, with the {{appropriate}} encouragement from the hunters--all was business, bustle, and activity.
