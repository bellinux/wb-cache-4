5|$|Since 1990 {{the total}} number of hours flown {{annually}} by the GA sector has remained in the range 1.25–1.35million, the dominant sector being traditional GA flying, which accounts for 0.6million per year. An overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth in hours flown has brought the annual average <b>utilisation</b> per aircraft down from 157 hours in 1984 to 103 hours in 2002. The decline in asset <b>utilisation</b> has led to speculation that the economic health of the GA industry is weakening, though the lack of data on profitability makes this difficult to confirm.|$|E

30|$|Simulation {{modelling}} {{has already}} been used effectively to model different scenarios such as rail yards [3], freight implementations to a passenger rail [4] and also complete rail networks. Specifically simulation modelling {{has been used to}} explore aspects of the metro system [20], <b>utilisations</b> have been meassured for stations and railway tracks and transit times recorded for trains to move between stations and their time stationary at each station. The work discussed in this paper builds on this work where <b>utilisations</b> of railway sections are analysed similarly using simulation modelling software [4].|$|R

30|$|The {{first step}} in {{modelling}} the new designs {{was to create a}} simulation model for the regular metro system between Haymarket and the airport. This would then be validated and have its <b>utilisations</b> of tracks recorded. There are no freight trains on this model.|$|R
30|$|This study {{presents}} a new design for an innovative {{baggage handling system}} which transfers baggage between a collection point, Haymarket, situated in the city centre of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne and Newcastle Airport. There are also two additional solutions which saturate the system with freight trains, resulting in greater <b>utilisations</b> of the metro tracks.|$|R
5|$|The {{route from}} Victoria to Orpington via Herne Hill is {{projected}} to be amongst the most congested and overcrowded in South East London by 2026. Network Rail is considering grade-separating the two lines passing through Herne Hill so that trains would not cross each other's paths at the station's junctions; this restricts the number of services that can pass through the station. A 2008 route <b>utilisation</b> strategy for South London concluded that this improvement will not be required before 2020 but recommended safeguarding the required land. Grade-separation is supported by Southeastern and First Capital Connect believed it should be given more consideration, but Network Rail has stated {{that it would be}} difficult to carry out the work because the station is on a viaduct and surrounded by buildings. The 2011 route <b>utilisation</b> strategy, which examined options for congestion relief at Herne Hill before 2031, did not suggest grade-separation as an option in the 2011–2031 period.|$|E

5|$|The amyloid {{hypothesis}} traditionally {{points to}} the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides as the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated amyloid fibrils, which {{are believed to be}} the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis, induces programmed cell death (apoptosis). It is also known that Aβ selectively builds up in the mitochondria in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected brains, and it also inhibits certain enzyme functions and the <b>utilisation</b> of glucose by neurons.|$|E

40|$|Static {{priority}} schemes {{have the}} disadvantage that processor <b>utilisations</b> less than 100 % must be tolerated if {{a system is}} to be guaranteed off-line. By comparison earliest deadline scheduling can theoretically utilise all of a processors capacity, although in practice run-time overheads are increased that undermine this advantage. In this paper a dual priority scheme is proposed: a task may execute in two phases; each phase has a static priority assigned, the transition from one phase to another is made at a fixed offset in time from {{the release of the}} task. <b>Utilisations</b> equal to 100 % can now be obtained whilst retaining an essentially static priority model. Examples of the scheme are given and some of its properties investigated. Implementation issues are also considered. 1.

5|$|Although the {{government}} of Bhutan goes {{to great lengths to}} prevent outside influences from intruding on Bhutanese culture, Drukair is not immune to problems which affect the airline industry and the world community at large. In June 2008, citing hikes in the price of oil and the need to contain operational costs, the airline reduced frequencies across its network and announced an increase in airfares to offset the increased costs, whilst taking advantage of the lower cost of jet fuel at Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok airports. Due to its small network which is reliant on fifth-freedom rights, Drukair regularly leases its aircraft to other airlines, such as Myanmar Airways International, Indian Airlines and Bangkok Airways in order to keep <b>utilisation</b> rates on its aircraft higher than they would under normal circumstances, whilst at the same time earning extra revenue.|$|E
5|$|Attalea {{species have}} a long history of human <b>utilisation.</b> Carbonised Attalea maripa seeds have been found in archaeological sites in Colombia dating back to 9000 BP. A variety of species remain {{important}} sources of edible oil, thatch, edible seeds and fibre. The leaves of Attalea butyracea and A.maripa are used extensively for thatching. Several species are oil palms, with A.speciosa among the most important economically. Products extracted from A.speciosa were reported to support over 300,000 households in the Brazilian state of Maranhão in 2005, and in 1985 it was estimated to support over 450,000 households throughout the Brazil. Piassava fibres, extracted from the leaf bases of A.funifera, are commercially important, and generated about US$20 million in annual income to Brazilian farmers in 1996.|$|E

30|$|During {{analysis}} of a modal system it may happen that runnables executed in neighbouring modes (i.e. the modes connected in the FSM) have similar WCETs and resource <b>utilisations.</b> In such case, there is little benefit in determining two separate mappings for these modes and migrating the runnables’ contexts during transitions between these modes. It would be more reasonable to cluster these states and treat them as a single mode in the further steps of the proposed approach.|$|R
30|$|After {{looking at}} the work of others using {{simulation}} modelling, {{it was a clear}} choice to model the system using such a software; SIMUL 8 in this case. Schedules of passenger and freight trains were implemented to the system and adjusted with ease. SIMUL 8 also allowed evaluation of the line between Haymarket and the airport to not only ensure that each design was validated but also allow their track <b>utilisations</b> to be compared to one another.|$|R
5|$|Network Rail, in its July 2011 London & South East route <b>utilisation</b> strategy, {{recommended}} that all services from Herne Hill towards Blackfriars should terminate {{in the bay}} platforms at Blackfriars after London Bridge's redevelopment is completed in 2018 and the diverted Thameslink trains return there. Passengers from Herne Hill would then have had to change at Blackfriars to travel further north. Network Rail made this recommendation because more services will be using the route between St Pancras and London Bridge from 2018; sending trains from Herne Hill to the terminating platforms {{on the western side}} of Blackfriars (instead of the through tracks on {{the eastern side of the}} station) would have removed the need for them to cross in front of trains to/from Denmark Hill and trains to/from London Bridge at junctions south of Blackfriars.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} in Kuala Lumpur and {{the rest}} of the Klang Valley covers a variety of transport modes such as bus, rail and taxi. Despite efforts to promote usage of public transport, <b>utilisation</b> rates are low as only 16 percent of the population used public transport in 2006. However, public transport <b>utilisation</b> is set to rise with the opening of 2 light metro (LRT) extension lines on 30 June 2016. Rail transport in Kuala Lumpur encompasses the light metro (LRT), monorail, commuter rail and Airport rail link. The LRT system has 2 lines namely, Kelana Jaya Line and Ampang Line, connecting many locations in the city with major suburbs in Greater Kuala Lumpur. The Monorail serves various key locations in the city centre whereas the KTM Komuter runs between the city and the suburbs. The main rapid transit hub is KL Sentral, which is an interchange station for the rail systems. KL Sentral is also a hub for intercity railway service namely KTM Intercity and KTM ETS. It provides rail services to as far as Singapore in the south, and Hat Yai, Thailand, in the north. The rail system in Kuala Lumpur is expanding fast with more train lines due for completion or in the pipeline. In December 2016, the 1st phase of Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Project, Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line was completed, the remaining phases of the line has been open in July 2017, providing a more efficient ride around Greater Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
