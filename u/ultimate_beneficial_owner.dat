40|$|After a brief {{introduction}} and {{examination of the}} economic rationale for accounting for foreign direct investment (FDI), we survey information on outward investors from Hong Kong and Singapore {{with the aim of}} illuminating the implications of accounting for such FDI by geographical source or by country of <b>ultimate</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner.</b> By any measure it is clear that a large part of FDI from these economies comes from foreign-controlled firms and hence that ownership-based estimates of FDI from these two economies would be much smaller than the standard, geography-based estimates. However, because outward investment by foreign firms in Hong Kong and Singapore often involves sub- stantial contributions from local staff and partners, an attempt is made to examine the extent of control over investment decisions exercised by these local staff and partners. Case studies from Hong Kong indicate a tendency for for local control over investment decisions to be relatively strong in 4 types of foreign-controlled Hong Kong firms, recently acquired firms, firms with strong local entrepreneurial involvement, customer-oriented firms, and relocated holding companies. On the other hand, evidence froma sample of Thai affiliates of foreign-controlled Hong Kong or Singapore investors suggested that many of the investors were acting as part of an integrated network of foreign investors. Thus, although it is clear local staff and partners have a large influence over the investment decisions of foreign-controlled outward investors in Hong Kong and Singapore, it does not appear that such firms are a majority among foreign-controlled investors in these economies. ...|$|E

Using a unique data set that links occupational data from separate establishments to the establishments' <b>ultimate</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>owners,</b> we are the first to study labor markets across establishments and across industries within large and diverse firms. We use these data to determine how wages and employment in firms' different establishments and different industries are related. We first identify patterns in the wage and occupational profiles of the industries that multi-industry firms choose to enter. We then show there to be a substantial component of wage rates common to all establishments and all industries within individual firms, even after netting out industry and occupation effects. This demonstrates the extent that internal labor markets of large, multi-establishment, multi-industry firms are linked throughout their entire organizations. Finally, we show that employment changes tend to be localized within establishments, suggesting that demand or productivity shocks to an establishment do not permeate throughout the firm. 1...|$|R
40|$|According to EU Directive 2015 / 849, all Member States must {{establish}} a central register {{of data on}} <b>ultimate</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>owners</b> of corporate legal entities and also of trusts and legal arrangements similar to trusts. First of all, this requires identification of the latter arrangements in the individual Member States, which {{is not an easy}} task: the definition related to being ‘similar to trusts’ is quite vague. The main aim with the article was to determine the arrangements in Estonian private law that should be considered in implementation of the UBO-register rules. Therefore, a brief overview is provided of trusts and two types of arrangements used in civil-law systems for the same purposes – the Treuhand and fiducie. The piece then highlights the similarities between these and the trust, with the conclusion being drawn that being ‘trust-like’ {{in the context of the}} directive boils down to situations wherein from the outside the property has one person as an owner but there also exists an internal relationship that obliges the title-holder to observe certain duties and that may grant another person the economic benefit from the property. Next, the article turns to the Estonian legal scene. Under consideration are family- and succession-law devices (e. g., executorship of a will), various forms of shared ownership and communities (in particular, silent partnership and contractual investment funds), mandate and commission contracts, intermediated holding of securities, and fiduciary ownership for security purposes. The conclusion is that there indeed are arrangements in the Estonian legal system that fall into the category of trust-like arrangements under the directive but that the registration of UBO data for all of them would not be without difficulties. Finally, some criteria for registration of the relevant arrangements are proposed...|$|R
5000|$|Paul Crosfield sold Witanhurst to the {{property}} developer Lionel Green in 1970, but it was possessed by banks shortly after, and owned by various other property developers for the next fifteen years. Various schemes for redeveloping Witanhurst were proposed and rejected by Camden council during this period including turning the house into a hotel or apartments, and various pieces of land from Witanhurst's large estate were sold. In 1976 Witanhurst was bought by a Kuwati, a Mr. Al-Hasouwy, for £1.3 million, who subsequently spent £500,000 developing {{the property}}. It was put up for sale in 1977 for £7 million with planning permission for 53 houses.

The <b>ultimate</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>owners</b> of Mounir Developments was eventually revealed in a court case to be a relation of the Assad family, the ruling family of Syria, that were then in exile in England. Somar al-Assad, a cousin of the then Syrian president Bashar al-Assad stated in a court case that he had not slept at Witanhurst in the previous eight years of ownership by a trust connected to the family.Witanhust was used as the location of BBC's Fame Academy talent show from 2002 to 2004. During its use on the show Witanhust was on English Heritage's list of buildings [...] "at risk". In 2002, during the first series of Fame Academy, nine portable buildings, a television studio and generators were erected in front of Witanhurst without the requisite consent required for a listed building. The production company Endemol withdrew their application to use Witanhurst for a planned third series of the show in 2004 following a critical report by planners from Camden London Borough Council.|$|R

In the European law, the term <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner</b> can be found in two European directives - "Interest and royalty payments directive" and "Income savings directive".
