Even though the harmful influence of the economic agent's activity on the environment has been noticed {{for over a century}} now, only in the last decades new span concepts and actions appeared, such as: sustainable development and national and international policies regarding the environment. Sustainable development pursues and tries to find a stable theoretical framework for making decisions in any situation in which a man/environment type relationship is found (whether it is about the environment or the economic or social medium) and it constitutes the main objective of sustainable development. At present, the concept comprises both the solving of the ecological crisis ensuring the quality of the environment and that of life quality in its complexity, including social and economic aspects. One of these solutions is the introduction of the "green certificates" concept. Its emergence led to the appearance of a competition in the field of energy production from renewable resources.

These studies, all of which are of observational design, found a lower incidence of hip fracture in estrogen users versus nonusers, although the differences in incidence did not always reach statistical significance.

Study population: Pregnant women with a first or second trimester ultrasound scan performed at all public hospitals in Denmark are registered in the database.

40|$|Summary The {{causation}} {{of breast}} cancer in certain strains of mice by a virus that can be transmitted vertically, through the milk produced during lactation, {{has led to the}} hypothesis that a similar phenomenon could exist in humans. There have been laboratory-based studies in humans suggesting that a virus may be involved in the etiology of female breast cancer although other investigations did not support this hypothesis. Descriptive data and epidemiologic evidence of ecologic nature do not indicate a role of lactation in the causation of human breast cancer, but the hypothesis has not been adequately assessed in analytic epidemiologic studies. A nested case-control study undertaken in Sweden to examine the role of prenatal factors on breast cancer risk in the offspring, allowed the evaluation of the importance of breast-feeding in the causation of this disease. Standardised records concerning women born at the Uppsala University Hospital from 1874 to 1954 were linked with invasive breast cancer incident cases, identified through their <b>unique</b> national <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> in the Swedish Cancer Registry during 1958 - 1990.

Little is, for example, known about potential differences in stroke care between high- and low- volume providers. 19 – 21 Therefore, we examined whether the annual case volume in stroke units is associated with the quality of early stroke care, 30 -day and 1 -year mortality, length of the initial hospital stay (LOS), and hospital bed- day use in the first year after stroke.
