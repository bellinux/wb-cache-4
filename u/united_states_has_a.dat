5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species {{with some degree of}} violet colour, C.violaceus and its close {{relatives}} are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species in the section Cortinarius are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E

25|$|Peace First, a {{non-profit}} organisation {{based in the}} <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> programme in which youth volunteers work with children to design and implement community projects in a participatory way. The rationale is that children are natural creative thinkers and problem solvers. The programme focuses on developing social and emotional skills of self- awareness, empathy, inclusivity and relationships. It has also been implemented in rural areas of Colombia through a partnership between local governments and Colombian NGOs. Peace First has additionally developed a curriculum {{that can be used}} in schools. It addresses themes such as friendship, fairness, cooperation, con ict resolution and consequences of actions through experiential activities and cooperative games. For example, 1st graders learn about communicating their feelings, 3rd graders develop skills and awareness around communication and cooperation, 4th graders practice courage and taking a stand and 5th graders explore how to resolve and de-escalate conflicts.|$|E

500|$|Tylopilus rubrobrunneus, {{found in}} {{hardwood}} forests of eastern North America, {{is similar in}} appearance to T.felleus, but has a purplish to purple-brown cap. It is also inedible due to its bitter taste. Another North American species, T.variobrunneus, has a cap that is reddish-brown to chestnut-brown, with olive tones in youth. It has shorter spores than T.felleus, typically measuring 9–13 by 3–4.5μm. In the field, it can be distinguished from the latter species by its mild to slightly bitter taste. T.rhoadsiae, found in the southeastern <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> lighter-coloured cap that is smaller, up to [...] in diameter. The edible T.indecisus and T.ferrugineus can be confused with T.felleus, but have less reticulated stalks. The dimensions of the spores of the Australian species T.brevisporus range from 9.2 to 10.5 by 3.5 to 3.9μm. T.neofelleus, limited in distribution to deciduous forests of China, New Guinea, Japan, and Taiwan, can be distinguished from T.felleus macroscopically by its vinaceous-brown cap and pinkish-brown to vinaceous stalk, and microscopically by its smaller spores (measuring 11–14 by 4–5μm) and longer pleurocystidia (49–107 by 14–24μm).|$|E
