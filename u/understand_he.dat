5|$|Dragon Ball was loosely {{modeled on}} the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. Torishima said he chose it largely {{because it was a}} free {{intellectual}} property, but also because its Chinese setting was not common in manga at the time and would make it both unique and differentiate it from Dr. Slumps West Coast of the United States feel. While the characters in Journey to the West travel to collect sacred scrolls, Toriyama added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give the characters a game-like activity of gathering something in order to appeal to its shōnen magazine audience. With Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Xuanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie, and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, he originally thought the story would last about a year, or end once the Dragon Balls were collected. Toriyama said that although the stories are purposefully easy to <b>understand,</b> <b>he</b> specifically aimed Dragon Ball at an older audience.|$|E
25|$|When questioned, Tristan says he cannot {{answer to}} the King the reason of his {{betrayal}} since he would not <b>understand.</b> <b>He</b> turns to Isolde, who agrees to follow him again {{into the realm of}} night. Tristan announces that Melot has fallen in love with Isolde too. Melot and Tristan fight, but, at the crucial moment, Tristan throws his sword aside and allows Melot to severely wound him.|$|E
25|$|Sindhu (Suhasini), {{working as}} a music teacher in a school, attends one of the concerts of JKB, where he is {{performing}} a Tyagaraja keerthanam which is in Telugu Language and she finds some the audience speaking to each other instead of listening to the music. Hence, she asks JKB to translate the song he is singing into Tamil, which everybody in the audience can <b>understand.</b> <b>He</b> then gets angry and challenges her to demonstrate. She successfully demonstrates it and is applauded by the audience. In a few days, Sindhu apologizes to JKB and he finds out that she is an intellectual equal and admires her knowledge of music. However this intellectual attraction is misunderstood based on the cultural limitations. Gajapathi, who has promised not to lie, informs Bhairavi that her husband is going out with Sindhu.|$|E

25|$|Setsuna being a Kurd was an {{international}} decision by Sunrise. This was done as critique to Japan's apathy towards religion. Director Seiji Mizushima {{wanted to give}} viewers a close approach to the wars in the Middle East, believing the problem would not be solved in a long time. Mizushima aimed to make the viewers understand Setsuna's feelings {{as a result of}} living under war conditions. In regards to his personality, Mizushima wanted the series' protagonist that could not be related with the audience. This was done to contrast previous Gundam protagonists and appeal to young viewers. While he saw his past as difficult to <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> might look appealing as a result. The staff also wanted to create a character the audience could relate to. Late in the series, Setsuna's Quanta system was introduced in order to convey his message that he wants war to end through communication rather than violence. This idea was explored once again in the movie where the plot was written so that nobody except Setsuna could end the conflict.|$|E
25|$|Since the Army {{was officially}} {{responsible}} {{for the security of}} the Pearl Harbor facilities and Hawaiian defense generally, and so of the Navy's ships while in port, Army actions are of particular interest. Short reported to Washington he had increased his alert level (but his earlier change in meaning for those levels was not understood in Washington and led to misunderstanding there about what he was really doing). In addition, Short's main concern was sabotage from fifth columnists (expected to precede the outbreak of war for decades preceding the attack), which accounts for his orders that Army Air Corps planes be parked close together {{near the center of the}} airfields. There seems to have been no increased Army urgency about getting its existing radar equipment properly integrated with the local command and control in the year it had been available and operational in Hawaii before the attack. Leisurely radar training continued and the recently organized early warning center was left minimally staffed. Anti-aircraft guns remained in a state of low readiness, with ammunition in secured lockers. Neither Army long-range bombers nor Navy PBYs were used effectively, remaining on a peacetime maintenance and use schedule. Short evidently failed to <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> had the responsibility to defend the fleet. In Short's defense, it should be noted he had training responsibilities to meet, and the best patrol aircraft, B-17s and B-24s, were in demand in the Philippines and Britain, both of which had higher priority.|$|E

500|$|According to Pitchfork Media, record {{producer}} Larry Crane {{reported on}} his Tape Op message board {{that he had}} planned to help Smith mix his album in mid-November. Crane wrote, [...] "I hadn't talked to Elliott in over a year. His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me [...] and asked if I'd like to come to L.A. and help mix and finish [...] I said 'yes, of course', and chatted with Elliott {{for the first time in}} ages. It seems surreal that he would call me to finish an album and then a week later kill himself. I talked to Jennifer this morning, who was obviously shattered and in tears, and she said, 'I don't <b>understand,</b> <b>he</b> was so healthy.|$|E
500|$|When the Beatles {{recorded}} [...] "Twist and Shout", {{the final}} track during the mammoth one-day session {{that produced the}} band's 1963 debut album, Please Please Me, Lennon's voice, already compromised by a cold, came close to giving out. Lennon said, [...] "I couldn't sing the damn thing, I was just screaming." [...] In the words of biographer Barry Miles, [...] "Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords {{in the interests of}} rock 'n' roll." [...] The Beatles' producer, George Martin, tells how Lennon [...] "had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never <b>understand.</b> <b>He</b> was always saying to me: 'DO something with my voice!... put something on it... Make it different.'" [...] Martin obliged, often using double-tracking and other techniques.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with SoulCulture, Usher told that the inspiration for writing [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] is about dealing with things that people can't <b>understand.</b> <b>He</b> further stated that the past can bring people [...] "down a road" [...] {{because they are not}} aware of it. According to him, [...] "The time spent with a father will teach you a certain understanding of live and how to cope and deal with things. The lack of a father being there can also teach you how to deal with life – and that’s what 'Sins Of The Father' is about... That statement was made because that’s something that I felt." [...] Usher added that the song itself is a [...] "kind of testament" [...] for the father he is.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the series was positive, with review aggregator website ComicBookRoundUp giving the series a score of 8.2 out of 10, based on 20 critics' reviews of individual issues. Reviewing the first issue for We The Nerdy, Taneisha Jane gave a score of 90 out of 100, describing it as having [...] "excellent storytelling that will keep you engaged", and complimenting Lorimer's artwork. Comic Vine's Tony Guerrero praised Lorimer's [...] "creepy" [...] artwork, but felt that the storytelling required too much foreknowledge of the television series to fully <b>understand.</b> <b>He</b> summed the issue up as being [...] "the crossover we've been waiting for". Reviewing the third issue for SciFiPulse, Patrick Hayes praised the series' use of photographic alternate covers for subscribers, and complimented the artwork and colouring throughout. Hayes rated the issue an [...] "A" [...] overall.|$|E
500|$|On April 16, 1953 {{against the}} St. Louis Browns (the second {{game of the}} season, and Chicago's home opener) Pierce pitched his second one-hitter, a 1–0 victory in which he allowed only a seventh-inning double by Bobby Young; the White Sox gained only two singles in the contest, and scored on a walk, {{sacrifice}} hit, error and sacrifice fly. Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: [...] "It was a hot day at Crosley Field and I remember being so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody for a guy his size, he had a real big delivery, nice to look at, and he had overcome a lot. I <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> had had epilepsy, and I was really pulling for him. He was a nervous little guy, {{and here he was}} starting his first All-Star game in a bandbox park that's tough to pitch in, and against Robin Roberts to boot. Pierce held them {{in the palm of his}} hand that day. He threw the ball right by everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|Akira Toriyama loosely modeled Dragon Ball on {{the classic}} Chinese novel Journey to the West; but also redeveloped it from his 1983 {{one-shot}} manga Dragon Boy. He {{has said that the}} fighting was influenced from movies by famous martial arts actor Jackie Chan, as he wanted to create a story with the basic theme of Journey to the West, but with [...] "a little kung fu." [...] Since it was serialized in a shōnen magazine, he added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give it a game-like activity of gathering something, without thinking of what the characters would wish for. With Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Xuanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, he originally thought it would last about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected. Toriyama stated that although the stories are purposefully easy to <b>understand,</b> <b>he</b> specifically aimed Dragon Ball at readers older than those of his previous serial Dr. Slump. He also wanted to break from the Western influences common in Dr. Slump, deliberately going for Chinese scenery, referencing Chinese buildings and photographs of China his wife had bought. The island where the Tenkaichi Budōkai is held is modeled after Bali, which he, his wife and assistant visited in mid-1985, and for the area around Bobbidi's spaceship he consulted photos of Africa.|$|E

500|$|The late 1980s were a {{busy period}} for Bubbles. Jackson took him on outings and would often talk to him. According to reports, he later showed {{him how to}} moonwalk. Bubbles had an agent and was rumoured to have his own bodyguard. He sat in for the {{recording}} of the Bad album— Jackson insisted that Bubbles and Jackson's pet snake attend as spectators—and accompanied Jackson for the filming of the [...] "Bad" [...] music video. In the short film for [...] "Liberian Girl", Bubbles made a cameo appearance. When the Bad world tour began in September, 1987, he and Jackson shared a two-bedroom hotel suite in Tokyo. During the tour, Bubbles and Jackson made a social visit to the Mayor of Osaka, Yasushi Oshima; there, Bubbles drank Japanese green tea while seated quietly next to Jackson. Oshima commented {{that he and his}} fellow officials were [...] "surprised to see the chimpanzee, but we <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> is [...] good friend ... This is the first time an animal ever entered City Hall." [...] Though allowed to travel to Japan, Bubbles was unable to enter Britain and Sweden due to strict quarantine laws. Jackson also brought Bubbles for tea at Elizabeth Taylor's house. Taylor did not mind the fact that Jackson had brought a chimpanzee. Later, at a party to celebrate and promote Bad, Bubbles reportedly [...] "worked the room" [...] and was [...] "the life of the party".|$|E
500|$|... is {{the main}} protagonist in Final Fantasy XII. He is a 17-year-old {{orphaned}} Hume street urchin who lost his parents in a plague when he was 12 years old. His only brother, Reks, died {{two years before the}} start of the game, during the Archadian invasion of Dalmasca. He makes a living as Migelo's assistant, running various errands for him, while at the same time pickpocketing from Archadian soldiers while claiming to take back what is Dalmasca's. He is a cheerful and energetic boy. Vaan dreams of someday becoming a sky pirate in command of his own airship. He trains to meet this goal by killing large dire rats in the sewers of Rabanastre on a daily basis, for which Dalan gave him the nickname [...] "Vaan Ratsbane." [...] Despite nominally being the main protagonist (as the player starts the game controlling him), the majority of the game focuses on the events and conflicts of the world as a whole and of Ashe, rather than Vaan's individual problems, with his character instead used as a narrative device to allow the player to follow the events as an outside observer. During the course of the game, Vaan comes to <b>understand</b> <b>he</b> has spent his time running from his problems and blaming the Archadian empire for them, rather than moving on with his life after his brother and parents' deaths. Vaan ends the game as a sky pirate, traveling the world along with Penelo.|$|E
500|$|Along with a {{focus on}} the {{characterizations}} and comedic possibilities of the dwarfs, Creedon's eighteen-page outline of the story written from the October meetings, featured a continuous flow of gags as well as the Queen's attempt to kill Snow White with a poisoned comb, an element taken from the Grimms' original story. After persuading Snow White to use the comb, the disguised Queen would have escaped alive, but the dwarfs would have arrived in time to remove it. After the failure of the comb, the Queen was to have the Prince captured and taken to her dungeon, where she would have come to him (story sketches show this event both with the Queen and the Witch) and used magic to bring the dungeon's skeletons to life, making them dance for him and identifying one skeleton as [...] "Prince Oswald", an example of the more humorous atmosphere of this original story treatment. It is written in story notes that the Queen has such magical power only in her own domain, the castle. With the Prince refusing to marry her, the Queen leaves him to his death (one sketch shows the Prince trapped in a subterranean chamber filling with water) as she makes her way to the dwarfs' cottage with the poisoned apple. The forest animals were to help the Prince escape the Queen's minions and find his horse. The Prince was to ride to the cottage to save Snow White but took the wrong road (despite warnings from the forest animals and his horse, whom he, unlike Snow White, could not <b>understand).</b> <b>He,</b> therefore, would not have arrived in time to save her from the Queen but {{would have been able to}} save her with love's first kiss. This plot was not used in the final film, though many sketches of the scene in the dungeon were made by Ferdinand Hovarth.|$|E

Aaron stated that the series finds Odinson in a dark place explaining, [...] "He failed for a reason we still don't quite <b>understand.</b> <b>He</b> dropped the hammer and hasn't been able to pick it up since.

His frank attitude is also in line with his admitted aggression, taking criticisms as challenges to overcome instead of something to mope over. This relates to his desire for challenges, producing games like Ninja Gaiden which are acknowledged as 'hard' by the gaming industry, and to push himself to produce games which can contend as the best games of the genre. He openly claims to be the sole creative force behind his projects, as well as being able to convey his plan clearly for the team to <b>understand.</b> <b>He</b> bemoans that the Japanese are starting to forget the basic concepts, closing off their minds to outside criticisms.|$|E
