In this study, a pump with an impeller diameter of 248 [*]mm was modeled and its performance was tested. Numerical simulations were conducted under steady and <b>unsteady</b> <b>states,</b> in which the sizes of the impeller diameters were designated as 248 [*]mm (original), 235. 6 [*]mm (5 % trimmed), 223. 2 [*]mm (10 % trimmed), and 210. 8 [*]mm (15 % trimmed). ANSYS software {{was used to test}} the shear stress transport (SST k-ω) of the four models, and results agreed well with experimental data. Diameter size affected impeller characteristics in both steady and <b>unsteady</b> <b>states.</b> Subsequently, the differences in performance, hydraulic loss, pressure pulsation, and radial force of the impellers were evaluated. In the performance test, the head and efficiency of the pump decreased as impeller diameter was reduced. The result trends are in accordance with the trim law within the acceptable error range. In terms of hydraulic loss, the impeller and diffuser vane components presented opposite trends with flow rate increase. Finally, in terms of pressure pulsation and radial force, the amplitude diminished while periodicity improved as impeller diameter decreased...|$|R

Without magnetic field, we find steady flow patterns, previously observed {{with a simple}} fluid, such as those containing normal one- or two vortex cells, as well as anomalous one-cell and twin-cell flow states. However, when a symmetry-breaking transverse magnetic field is present, all flow states exhibit stimulated, finite two-fold mode. Various bifurcations between steady and <b>unsteady</b> <b>states</b> can occur, corresponding to the transitions between the two-cell and one-cell <b>states.</b> While <b>unsteady,</b> axially oscillating flow states can arise, we also detect {{the emergence of new}} <b>unsteady</b> flow <b>states.</b> In particular, we uncover two new states: one contains only the azimuthally oscillating solution in the configuration of the twin-cell flow state, and another a rotating flow state. Topologically, these flow states are a limit cycle and a quasiperiodic solution on a two-torus, respectively. Emergence of new flow states in addition to observed ones with classical fluid, indicates that richer but potentially more controllable dynamics in ferrofluidic flows, as such flow states depend on the external magnetic field.

The soccer ball may achieve a maximum velocity of 131 km/h when ejected, allowing a shooting speed of 100 km/h when the unit is operating at 70 % power.

The main ob-jective {{of the work is}} to study the thermohydrodynamic characteristics of a two-phase capillary flow with phase change at the meniscus.
