5|$|Every line stays {{unchanged}} by the curve-shortening flow. Lines are {{the only}} curves that are <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> the curve-shortening flow, although there exist more complex stable networks of curves, such as the hexagonal tiling of the plane.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} were affected by inability to reach their premises even where the premises themselves were largely <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> the blast. Criticism was expressed by local citizens and the local MP that originally the depot had been constructed away from other buildings, but that developmental pressures had led to both houses and commercial premises being built near the depot.|$|E

Added instruments should be insignificant under correct specification, with parameter estimates nearly <b>unaffected,</b> confirmed <b>by</b> Monte Carlo. Selecting instruments does not affect these results. Instrumental variables Model selection Monte Carlo simulation...|$|R
50|$|Today the atoll {{is still}} of {{particular}} interest to geneticists; due to the small gene pool and rapid population growth, the disorder is now prevalent in almost 10% of the population, with a further 30% being <b>unaffected</b> carriers (<b>by</b> comparison, in the United States, only 1 in 33,000, or 0.003%, are affected). Leading neurologist Oliver Sacks's 1997 book The Island of the Colorblind references the island.|$|R
5|$|Several dry valleys {{originate}} on Llullaillaco, including Quebrada de las Zorritas on the north-northeastern slope, Quebrada El Salado and Quebrada Llullaillaco on {{the northwestern}} slope, and Quebrada La Barda on the southwestern slope. The Quebrada Llullaillaco drains into the Salar de Punta Negra {{northwest of the}} volcano. The volcano is relatively <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> water erosion.|$|E
5|$|The first chiral Lewis acid {{promoted}} asymmetric Nazarov cyclization {{was reported}} by Varinder Aggarwal and utilized copper (II) bisoxazoline ligand complexes with up to 98% ee. The enantiomeric excess was <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> use of 50mol% of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased.|$|E
5|$|The present {{shape of}} the walls was defined in the 14th century after the city gained its full {{independence}} from Venetian suzerainty, but the peak of its construction lasted {{from the beginning of}} the 15th century until the latter half of the 16th century. Being constructed very solidly, the walls were generally <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> a strong earthquake occurring in 1667.|$|E
25|$|It {{starts to}} {{decompose}} at about 170°C and melts at 204°C. At room temperature, {{it is very}} stable. It burns rather than explodes. It detonates only with a detonator, being <b>unaffected</b> even <b>by</b> small arms fire. This property makes it a useful military explosive. It is less sensitive than pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). Under normal conditions, RDX has a Figure of Insensitivity of exactly 80 (RDX defines the reference point.).|$|R
40|$|Horse anti-dog {{lymphocyte}} serum {{was found}} to suppress the immune response of dogs normally resulting from the injection of Salmonella typhi vaccine. Normal antibody levels of the dogs against Shigella dysenteriae were <b>unaffected,</b> however, <b>by</b> the anti-lymphocyte serum. The results suggest, therefore, that the natural antibodies may arise by a population of cells or by mechanisms different from those which produce antibodies {{as a result of}} deliberate antigenic stimulation...|$|R

The feasibility of {{the application of a}} recursive linear Kalman filtering technique to image processing is demonstrated. The procedure is applicable to images which are characterized statistically by mean and correlation functions. A time invariant dynamic model is proposed to provide stationary statistics for the scanner output...|$|R
5|$|The {{pressure}} from B. rufimanus seems <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> management practices and cultivar although little data is available. Because B. rufimanus biology is highly linked to crop development and climatic conditions, pest damage and pressure {{the next year}} can vary according to sowing and harvesting date. In addition, sanitation can help decreasing the source of B. rufimanus in production areas.|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{was largely}} <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> war, though some animals were euthanised for safety reasons during the Second World War. After the war the park housed a brown bear named Voytek {{who had served}} with the Polish military. In 1972 one of the zoo's king {{penguins}} {{was adopted by the}} Norwegian military.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{ingredients}} of this equation, the arc length, curvature, and time, are all <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> translations and rotations of the Euclidean plane, {{it follows that the}} flow defined by this equation is invariant under translations and rotations (or more precisely, equivariant). If the plane is scaled by a constant dilation factor, the flow remains essentially unchanged, but is slowed down or sped up by the same factor.|$|E
5|$|By the 9th century, the Slavs {{had settled}} the Baltic coast in Pomerania, which {{subsequently}} {{developed into a}} commercial and military power. Along the coastline, remnants of Scandinavian settlements and emporia were to be found. The most important of them was probably the trade settlement and seaport of Truso, located in Prussia. Prussia itself was relatively <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> Slavic migration and remained inhabited by Baltic Old Prussians. During the same time, the tribe of the Vistulans (Wiślanie), based in Kraków and the surrounding region, controlled a large area in the south, which they developed and fortified with many strongholds.|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{moved to}} a farm in modern the Buenos Aires {{neighborhood}} of Núñez. The farm had some agriculture fields and a small brick factory. He lived next to other influential people like Cornelio Saavedra, Juan Larrea, Miguel de Azcuénaga, and attorney José Darragueira. The meetings of the secret society continued, <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> the departure of Burke. On June 2, 1806, Castelli's mother died, {{and he was still}} in mourning when the city learned of a British landing in Quilmes.|$|E
40|$|The {{significant}} changes in Purchasing and Supply management {{over the last decade}} did not leave the Purchasing function <b>unaffected.</b> Triggered <b>by</b> rapid changes in the dynamic business environment, new tasks and the use of web-enabled systems, the role of purchasing professionals has evolved from a rather clerical towards a more tactical and strategic function (Giunipero & Pearcy, 2000; Giunipero, Handfield & Eltantawy, 2006). Consequently, purchasing decision-making has become more knowledge and competence driven (Bouwmans, 2003). Purchasing professionals are assigned with more responsibilities an...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between Trp-tRNA and Pro-tRNA, which have complementary anticodon sequences, {{has been used}} as a probe of anticodon conformation. It is <b>unaffected,</b> however, <b>by</b> the base change in the D-stem present in UGA-suppressor Trp-tRNA. This does not support the hypothesis that UGA suppression depends upon a conformational change induced in the anticodon. The stable denatured form of wild-type Trp-tRNA no longer interacts with Pro-tRNA; the structure of the anticodon region must therefore be quite different in the denatured form...|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} letter to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger {{suggested}} that his uncle's death {{was due to the}} reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> the volcanic gases, and so {{it is more likely that}} the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack. His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.|$|E
5|$|In time, the {{ineffectiveness}} of the CIP {{began to}} concern the Eisenhower administration, who {{were worried about}} the lack of industrialization. The corruption that permeated the initiative remained a problem. The rural peasants of Vietnam, who comprised more than 80% of the population, were <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> the aid package except for the resentment that it instilled in them when they observed the relative affluence of their city counterparts compared to their own impoverished state. However, the program was credited with transforming the textile industry, as 25,000 sewing machines were imported {{in the first year of}} its operation.|$|E
5|$|Membership is conferred for life. Formerly, {{the death}} of a monarch ("demise of the Crown") brought an {{immediate}} dissolution of the Council, as all Crown appointments automatically lapsed. By the 18th century, it was enacted that the Council would not be dissolved until up to six months after the demise of the Crown. By convention, however, the sovereign would reappoint all members of the Council after its dissolution. In practice, therefore, membership continued without a break. In 1901 the law was changed to ensure that Crown Appointments became wholly <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> any succession of monarch.|$|E

50|$|The poor working {{conditions}} pushed the miners to organize, {{and when the}} Walker Brothers at the Alice Mine and A.J. Davis at the Lexington mine cut wages for unskilled underground workers from $3.50 a day to $3.00 a day, union mobilization was sped up. The skilled laborers, even though <b>unaffected,</b> stood <b>by</b> to support their coworkers. In peaceful protest led by Aaron Witter, an Indiana miner, the men won back their $3.50 a day wages and soon after on June 13, 1878 the Butte Workingmen’s Union (BWU) was formed with Aaron Witter as President.|$|R
5|$|On September 4, 2007, {{charges against}} Carwin Jones and Theo Shaw {{were reduced to}} aggravated second-degree battery and {{conspiracy}}, as were those of Robert Bailey, Jr. on September 10. Bryant Purvis was arraigned on reduced charges of aggravated battery and conspiracy to commit aggravated battery on November 7, 2007, and pleaded not guilty. Because Louisiana law considers seventeen-year-olds to be adults for purposes of criminal culpability, the charges for these four were <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> the appellate ruling overturning Bell's conviction.|$|E
5|$|Seven years later, in 542, {{a devastating}} {{outbreak}} of Bubonic Plague, {{known as the}} Plague of Justinian and second only {{to that of the}} 14th century, laid siege to the world, killing tens of millions.

However, the Imperial Court did prove susceptible to plague, with Justinian himself contracting, but surviving, the pestilence.|$|E
5|$|The 2004 Indian Ocean {{earthquake}} was an undersea, megathrust {{earthquake that}} occurred on 26 December 2004, with an epicentre off {{the west coast}} of Sumatra, Indonesia, triggering a series of devastating tsunamis along coastal fringes of the Indian Ocean. Nagapattinam district was the most affected part of Tamil Nadu, accounting for 6,064 off the 8,009 casualties in the state. Sirkazhi remained mostly <b>unaffected</b> <b>by</b> the tsunami, but the groundwater quality deteriorated where aquifers were close to the water bodies. There was heavy salt water intrusion inland.|$|E

50|$|The first {{assumption}} {{tends to}} be true since monazite is very unlikely to incorporate Pb during its growth. The non-radiogenic Pb content in many laboratory tests {{were found to be}} very low, nearly always lower than 1 ppm. The most common error arose from this assumption is the contamination with lead during sample preparation. The second assumption is usually justified by the concordant behavior of the mineral observed in tests. That means the system is either reset totally or <b>unaffected</b> totally <b>by</b> geological processes, there is not partial resetting of the system. Minor errors are arose due to negligible disturbance during mass transfer.|$|R
