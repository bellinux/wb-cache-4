40|$|The {{origin and}} nature of extreme energy cosmic rays (EECRs), which have {{energies}} above the 50 EeV, the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) energy limit, {{is one of the}} most interesting and complicated problems in modern cosmic-ray physics. Existing ground-based detectors have helped to obtain remarkable results in studying cosmic rays before and after the GZK limit, but have also produced some contradictions in our understanding of cosmic ray mass composition. Moreover, each of these detectors covers only a part of the celestial sphere, which poses problems for studying the arrival directions of EECRs and identifying their sources. As a new generation of EECR space detectors, TUS (Tracking Ultraviolet Set-up), KLYPVE and JEM-EUSO, are intended to study the most energetic cosmic-ray particles, providing larger, <b>uniform</b> <b>exposures</b> of the entire celestial sphere. The TUS detector, launched on board the Lomonosov satellite on April 28, 2016, from Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia, is the first of these. It employs a single-mirror optical system and a photomultiplier tube matrix as a photo-detector and will test the fluorescent method of measuring EECRs from space. Utilizing the Earth's atmosphere as a huge calorimeter, it is expected to detect EECRs with energies above 100 EeV. It will also be able to register slower atmospheric transient events: atmospheric fluorescence in electrical discharges of various types including precipitating electrons escaping the magnetosphere and from the radiation of meteors passing through the atmosphere.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the effects on the shape and {{position}} of the characteristic curve due to a low level <b>uniform</b> <b>exposure</b> to white light. This was accomplished using a special camera which produced {{an image of a}} neutral density -wedge on a film strip. One half of this image was covered while the other half was uniformly exposed to a low level light exposure. In some cases the low level exposure was first applied to half of the film strip with the image exposure occurring second. The density differences between the two halves of the film strip were measured and compared to density differences expected from additive exposure. The density differences were also analysed with respect to the time delay between the imaging and additional <b>uniform</b> <b>exposure.</b> This is repeated for each level of additional exposure. A graphical analysis based on a hypothetical film type was performed and then the same done for the test data. Graphical analysis was then done to determine if effects other than those attributable to additive exposure occurred. Conclusions were drawn concerning the effects of the level of additional exposure, and of the time delay between exposures, on the density differences produced by the additional exposure. For the film type and processing conditions used, a level of additional exposure producing a density of 0. 016 above base plus fog density, introduced significantly greater density increase when the additional <b>uniform</b> <b>exposure</b> occurred after the image exposure. No significant difference, with respect to time, occurred for an additional exposure of 0. 006 above base fog. The greatest effects were noticed in the toe region of the density versus Log exposure curve, where the slope of the density versus exposure curve is the greatest. For the type 5302 film, non-uniform exposure in the camera system caused errors in determining the log exposure values for the projected step wedge image. Sensitometer control strips were used to determine those values for the type 5302 film, however, no control strips existed for the Tri-X, due to my error, and exposure values could not be determined.

Results from our fluorescence quenching assays provide insight on flippase kinetics as well as flippase mediated phospholipid distribution across the membrane bilayer. With fluorescent annexin V binding assays, we also demonstrate that RBL- 2 H 3 cells can be stimulated or perturbed in various ways that promote flippase mediated phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on the cell surface. In particular, activated RBL- 2 H 3 cells display distinctly punctate PS exposure, while cholesterol depleted cells exhibit sparse PS exposure on the membrane extracellular leaflet.

40|$|If {{the binding}} {{strength}} of adhesive cues to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the mechanisms involved in cell adhesion are synergistically correlated via a “mechanical” feedback, engineering of cue {{presentation at the}} ECM by designer macromolecules can enable control over cell–matrix interaction. Here, polymer brushes supporting fibronectin (FN) and presenting different grafted-chain length to modulate cell interaction at ECM cell-binding sites are exploited. Application of friction force microscopy allows us to estimate the lateral deformability and friction of oligoethylene glycol-containing brushes. These parameters are demonstrated to regulate the adhesion of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), which adopt their morphology and form focal adhesions (FAs) responding to FN brush-tether characteristics. Across a brush-thickness gradient presenting <b>uniform</b> FN <b>exposure,</b> thin brushes stimulate cell spreading {{and the development of}} FAs. Conversely, thick and more laterally deformable polymer grafts induce a decrease in cell spreading and FA formation. A correlation between frictional forces experienced at the (macro) molecular scale and the behavior of stem cells has been found.

We compared pollen counts in hair washes to counts provided by stationary volumetric and gravimetric pollen traps in 2 different settings: urban with volunteers living in short distance from one another and from the static trap and suburban in which volunteers live in a scattered environment, quite far from the static trap.

Pollen counts in hair washes are in full agreement with trap counts for <b>uniform</b> pollen <b>exposure.</b> In contrast, for diverse pollen exposure,. individual pollen counts in hair washes vary strongly in quantity and taxa composition between individuals and dates.
