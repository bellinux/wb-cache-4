5|$|Doug made a {{start in}} Game 4 of the 2013 ALDS against the Oakland Athletics, with the Tigers facing elimination. He gave up three runs and seven hits in six innings of work.

5|$|Maibaum kept {{on making}} rewrites as filming progressed.

Education levels are also low, with just under half of the population illiterate.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} a July 4 {{game against the}} Braves (which he won), Richard was sent into the bullpen to add Tom Griffin into the Astros' starting rotation.
