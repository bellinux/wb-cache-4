5|$|Other common changes {{include the}} {{replacement}} of the factory stock tires with rain tires or mud and snow tires and the shortening of the vehicle's wheelbase to improve maneuverability. For smaller applications smaller trucks are used. In Canada pickup trucks are used with snow removal operations with a blade mounted in front and optional de-icing equipment installed in the rear. <b>Underbody</b> scrapers are also used by some agencies and are mounted between axles, distributing plowing stresses on the chassis more evenly.|$|E

25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{shape of}} the car was designed by Oscar Jankovits, probably inspired by contemporary aerodynamic theories such as Paul Jaray's,and built at the Jankovits garage between 1935 and 1937. It was a barchetta with central driving position, with fully integrated wings (ponton styling). The body shell was streamlined to minimise turbulence in the air flow, fully enveloping the <b>underbody</b> and integrating door handles and lights.|$|E
50|$|Rufous {{whistlers}} are large-headed and stocky. They have short beaks {{and long}} tails (almost {{as long as}} the rest of the bird) which are very narrow and have sharp, forked tips.The species is sexually dimorphic. While females are typically dull brown or grey with streaked <b>underbodies,</b> males are predominantly dark-grey with white throats and (in most cases) a black mask that covers most of their head and some of their neck.These birds are between 16 and 18 centimetres in size, on average, and their average weight is approximately 25 grams.|$|R
50|$|The Golden Cascade was {{so named}} because of its golden hue, and for the {{prominent}} Cascade Range of the Northwest. They weigh 6-8 pounds (2.7-3.6 kilos). Females have Fawn or buff plumage and Orange beaks with brown markings. Drakes have yellow beaks, Satin green or Bronze heads, white ring on their necks, reddish breasts and white <b>underbodies.</b> The throat can turn light fawn. Older drakes can molt to a fawn or buff that covers the head and body but First year birds should have a chestnut chest with the classic golden buff to white shoulders, sides and belly. The ducklings may be sexed by down color: darker for males, lighter for females.|$|R

My purpose was a run to Quebec in [...] "Postal Packet 162 or such other as may be appointed"; and the Postmaster-General himself {{countersigned}} the order. This talisman opened all doors, even those in the despatching-caisson {{at the foot of the}} tower, where they were delivering the sorted Continental mail. The bags lay packed close as herrings in the long grey <b>underbodies</b> which our G.P.O. still calls [...] "coaches." [...] Five such coaches were filled as I watched, and were shot up the guides to be locked on to their waiting packets three hundred feet nearer the stars.|$|R
25|$|Another {{problem has}} become common since more Fieros are being {{serviced}} by auto repair shops {{not familiar with}} their design.

25|$|The Hawk T1A is a {{modified}} Hawk T1, intended {{to replace the}} Hawker Hunter in the RAF's Tactical Weapons Units. A total of 89 aircraft were converted to carry two underwing AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and a centreline Aden gun pod. This is also the variant used by the RAF's Red Arrows display team; the <b>underbody</b> gun pod {{is replaced by a}} fairing used to carry diesel fuel and dye for the display smoke system.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a version}} of 370Z Coupé commemorating Nissan's global success in GT racing and 40 years of Z in the UK, for the UK market.

5000|$|Antelope have a {{wide variety}} of coverings, though most have a dense coat of short fur. In most species, the coat (pelage) is some {{variation}} of a brown colour (or several shades of brown), often with white or pale <b>underbodies.</b> Exceptions include the zebra-marked zebra duiker, the grey, black, and white Jentink's duiker, and the black lechwe. Most of the [...] "spiral-horned" [...] antelopes have pale, vertical stripes on their backs. Many desert and semidesert species are particularly pale, some almost silvery or whitish (e.g. Arabian oryx); the beisa and southern oryxes have gray and black pelages with vivid black-and-white faces. Common features of various gazelles are white rumps, which flash a warning to others when they run from danger, and dark stripes midbody (the latter feature is also shared by the springbok and beira). The springbok also has a pouch of white, brushlike hairs running along its back, which opens up when the animal senses danger, causing the dorsal hairs to stand on end.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{models are}} {{constructed}} of some light, seasoned wood, such as pine, preferably white pine, white cedar or mahogany free from knots. The hull may either be hollowed {{out of a}} solid block of wood, or cut from layers of planks in the so-called bread-and-butter style, or planked over a frame of keel and cross-sections. The first two methods are used in constructing dugout models. Hollowing out from the solid block entails {{a great deal of}} labor and has therefore fallen into disfavor. In the bread-and-butter style a number of planks, which have been shaped to the horizontal sections of the model and from which the middle has been sawn out, are glued together and then cut down to the exact lines of the design, templates being used to test the precision of the curves. In the planked, or built-up model, which is generally chosen by more expert builders, the planks are tacked to the frame, as in the construction of large vessels. Hulls may also be formed from modern plastics, which may be purchased from a manufacturer as termomoldings or fiberglass layups or fabricated by the modeler, by first making a positive model from clay or plaster (or using an existing model's hull) and then creating a negative mold from fiberglass or plaster. Models may be exaggerated cutters, so far as their <b>underbodies</b> are concerned, or, more often, are fitted with fin-keels weighted, after the manner of full-sized yachts. They may have any -rig, but schooner and sloop rigs are most common, the latter being the favorite for racing on account of its simplicity.|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this project is to {{investigate}} the energy consumption of the manufacturing lines in the car industry {{and look for the}} potential methods regarding energy saving. Special emphasis is put on the lighting technologies {{that can be used in}} the manufacturing processes. Two lighting technologies are tested in order to see which one has better performance and lower energy consumption. Fluorescent tube and LED tube are compared concerning illuminance, UV irradiance and power consumption. Economic evaluation is also conducted to exam the feasibilities replacing fluorescent tubes with LED tubes. Results of the study show that the LED tubes have much lower energy consumption than fluorescent tubes, produce more direct and „colder“ light, and have much lower UV irradiance. However, the payback period of LED is relatively long at current price situation. Since it is expected that the price of LED tubes will decrease in future, it is reasonable to predict that the LED technology will change the fluorescent one in many applications. The energy consumption has been estimated for two manufacturing lines which use different technologies to produce car <b>underbodies.</b> In order to identify the differences from the energy consumption point of view, some measurements are conducted, such as the consumption of electricity, compressed air, air for ventilation and cooling water. The measured results show a disproportion in the power consumption when the lines are in stand-by mode. This affects the energy consumption per produced unit significantly. The line that has a higher capacity and a lower power consumption in the stand-by mode has a lower energy consumption per produced unit when it is operating with lower production loading. So, in order to improve the energy efficiency, it is necessary that it works at as high volume as possible and to have the stand-by power consumption as low as possible...|$|R
25|$|Green {{vehicles}} {{are intended to}} have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles, although when {{the environmental impact of}} a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its life cycle {{this may not be the}} case. Electric vehicle technology has the potential to reduce transport CO2 emissions, depending on the embodied energy of the vehicle and the source of the electricity. The primary sources of electricity currently used in most countries (coal, gas, oil) mean that until world electricity production changes substantially, private electric cars will result in the same or higher production of CO2 than petrol equivalent vehicles. The Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving, thus removing the need to stop at a charging station. The City of Gumi in South Korea runs a 24km roundtrip along which the bus will receive 100kW (136 horsepower) electricity at an 85% maximum power transmission efficiency rate while maintaining a 17cm air gap between the <b>underbody</b> of the vehicle and the road surface.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the supply}} of spare parts had been assured by mid-season, the B186s were {{modified}} to incorporate a whole array of new aerodynamic features (including front and rear wings and a revised <b>underbody),</b> new suspension packages and revised setup concepts. The chassis was also strengthened further {{to cope with the}} stress caused by the power of the BMW engine. The development package was completed by the arrival of a new rear wing design for the Austrian Grand Prix, where the improved performance of the B186 and the high-speed Österreichring circuit made it the fastest car in the field with Fabi (pole) and Berger occupying the front row of the grid. The car's competitiveness improved throughout the season, particularly during the second half, {{as a result of this}} development. In addition, it also became more reliable, although this aspect remained suspect throughout the year with a total of nineteen retirements from 32 starts. The competitiveness of the Pirelli tyres also improved, and their relative durability compared to the Goodyears often played to the B186's advantage, exemplified by the fact that Berger won the 1986 Mexican Grand Prix due to not having to make a pit stop for a fresh set of tyres while most of the main contenders (with the exception of Prost's McLaren which finished 2nd) made at least two stops for tyres due to the abrasive surface of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.|$|E

40|$|A general {{method for}} calculating the {{performance}} {{of all types of}} wind driven vessels has been developed. The method is of such a nature that it may be used, without specific experimental assistance, as a qualitative guide in preliminary design. To this same procedure, data from a few simple tests of the model in question may be applied to obtain good quantitative performance information. As a result, existing yacht model testing procedure Reference (4) can be considerably simplified {{while at the same time}} obtaining information of much broader applicability. The use of the principles of this method, if not the letter, should tend to rationalize the arbitrary and extremely restrictive handicapping rules for ocean racing now in existence. Further, the owner, in possession of a performance analysis of his vessel, can be guided in his choice of course and sail setting as these are fundamental parameters of the general performance equation. The optimum sail setting for any wind speed and boat direction is of a necessity obtained in the process of the solution of this equation. The method provides several rather surprising general conclusions. It is indicated that angle of heel, contrary to Reference (4) is not a fundamental variable, and therefore stability only enters the picture in so far as the designer has a "gentlemen's agreement" not to provide more sail than will heel the vessel to a certain angle in a given wind. It is found that only draft is a monotonic parameter in performance; all other form and sail variables exhibit optimums, some perhaps outside of the practical range. Also, it is found from the experimental data of Reference (5) that yacht <b>underbodies,</b> despite their extremely low aspect ratio, exhibit a polar of lateral force and induced resistance with a character in agreement with the simple Prandtl theory. The interference effect of the surface, however, is found to be at variance with the result obtained from a lifting line vortex arranged to satisfy the water boundary condition. It is found that the usual triangular yacht sail does not have as bad a downwash distribution as one might first suspect on considering the plan form and twist. The presence of the water surface has the effect of providing a corrective upwash distribution. It is found that simple static stability calculations with the water surface assumed undisturbed, at the boat, lead to surprisingly good agreement with the righting moments obtained experimentally under dynamic conditions. ...|$|R
50|$|After {{a year in}} Rio, {{the race}} {{returned}} to Interlagos, now with new and upgraded facilities {{for the next two}} seasons; this race was won by Jacques Laffite to complete his and Ligier's conquest of the opening South American rounds in Argentina and Brazil. But the Interlagos surface was still very bumpy. The original arrangement from 1978 onwards was to alternate the Brazilian Grand Prix between the São Paulo and Rio circuits; the 1980 race was originally supposed to be held at Jacarepagua but parts of that circuit (which was originally built on a swamp) were beginning to sink into the soft ground and the circuit disintegrated badly, so the 1980 Grand Prix was to be relocated to Interlagos. But by this time, the population of São Paulo had risen from 5 to 8 million over the space of 10 years; the area surrounding the track was becoming increasingly run-down and the growing slums surrounding the circuit did not look good for Formula One, which thanks to worldwide television exposure was becoming something of a glamorous spectacle. Formula One was originally supposed to come back to Interlagos for the 1981 season after the track surface there would be repaved; it turned out that F1 came back a year too early. The drivers were dissatisfied with the safety conditions of the very bumpy 5-mile Interlagos circuit which had not been changed after the previous year's improvements. The ground-effect wing cars of that year had a tendency to bounce up and down thanks to the suction created by the cars' wing-shaped <b>underbodies,</b> and they were more stiffly suspended than before; so these fragile cars were barely tolerant of such a rough track and were very unpleasant to drive. The bad surface was so rough that the bumps caused mechanical problems for some cars. Also, the barriers and catch-fence arrangements were not adequate enough for Formula One. Jody Scheckter attempted to stop the race from going ahead but this did not work and the race ended up being won by Frenchman Rene Arnoux. With Formula One's more glamorous image being better suited to the more wealthy and better-looking city of Rio de Janeiro, the F1 circus went back to Rio again and the circuit went on to host the 1980s turbo era.|$|R
40|$|The {{automotive}} industry is under expanding legislative pressure to decrease vehicle weight {{in order to}} enhance fuel efficiency; and to improve crash performance as well. For this purpose, hot rolled FB 590 is a high strength steel (HSS) which can be used in automotive chassis and suspension applications. A major problem affecting mainly car <b>underbodies</b> is the effect of corrosion, often nucleating at sites where stone chipping has damaged protective coatings. Therefore, car components are frequently exposed to aggressive environments as a consequence of aqueous salts from the street coming into contact with affected and unprotected steel. This circumstance significantly decreases both the life and the appearance of the influenced parts, and may result in compromised structural strength leading to catastrophic failure. The main aim of this research is to further the understanding of the effects of simulated operational environments. Fatigue tests were initially carried out on mild steel under tensile loading and two severity-levels of corrosion as preliminary tests. Then a comprehensive programme of fatigue tests was performed on FB 590 and its welds under bending and tensile loading and covering the range of environmental conditions experienced in automotive applications. There is no available data for FB 590 in terms of fatigue performance in various environments and under bending and tensile loading as well. Additional techniques such as surface profilometry, scanning electron microscopy and so on were added to support the findings. The other aim was to monitor fatigue tests using a combination of Acoustic Emission (AE) and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) to identify the damage mechanisms that occur during failure although there had been limited research in this area. The combination of AE and DIC can provide much useful information to help to distinguish the different AE signals originating from various possible failure mechanisms such as plastic deformation, delamination of corrosion products or DIC paint and crack initiation and propagation. This might be utilized for an effective and powerful approach to monitoring multiple failure mechanisms; this has significant applications in automotive chassis testing. This information can provide a very valuable tool for the purpose of assessing material for automotive designers, which can then be used to decide on appropriate safety factors to avoid over-designing products and in order to ensure reliability and robustness of new products. In addition, the steel industry can also benefit from this research, as these findings can assist in enhancing the products and diminishing the effects of these environments on structural integrity...|$|R

The air temperature was , and the track temperature was [...] About 142,000 people attended the race. The standing water caused heavy spray and impaired visibility, and all cars used full wet tyres. The race began behind the safety car, with no formation lap; despite the slow speed, drivers struggled for grip on the wet surface. Ericsson lost control of his car after accelerating out of the final turn, and spun into the gravel trap at the corner. Marshals pushed his car out of the gravel, enabling him to keep driving. Following complaints from Hamilton about poor visibility, the race was suspended after two laps. The cars drove back into the pit lane, lined up in grid formation and their engines were shut off. Several cars had their ride heights raised to make them less prone to aquaplaning on their <b>underbody</b> planks. The race was restarted 20 minutes later behind the safety car, after the rain let up. Alonso stopped his car with an electrical issue (possibly a short circuit from the wet conditions), and was the race's first retirement on lap three.
