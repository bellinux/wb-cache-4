30|$|Primary pores mainly form at this stage. After {{volcanic}} lava is ejected {{onto the}} surface, pores are {{formed by the}} escape of {{a large amount of}} volatile gases. Crystallization of volcanic lava resulted in the forming of small intercrystalline pores between phenocrysts, between microcrystallites, and between phenocrysts and microcrystallites. Pores among <b>volcanic</b> <b>breccias</b> were formed under volcanic eruption and explosion. Solidification of volcanic lava produced contraction fractures and other primary reservoir pores. These primary pores lay a solid foundation for the development of reservoirs at later stages. In vertical profile, lithological combinations with large amounts of lava and tuff or <b>volcanic</b> <b>breccia,</b> lava and pyroclastics can be observed, which reflect volcanic activities.|$|R

40|$|Field outcrop observation, {{drilling}} core description, thin-section analysis, SEM analysis, and geochemistry, indicate that Dixi area of Carboniferous volcanic rock gas reservoir {{belongs to the}} volcanic rock oil reservoir of the authigenic gas reservoir. The source rocks make contact with volcanic rock reservoir directly or by fault, and having the characteristics of near source accumulation. The volcanic rock reservoir rocks mainly consist of acidic rhyolite and dacite, intermediate andesite, basic basalt and volcanic breccia: (1) Acidic rhyolite and dacite reservoirs are developed in the middle-lower part of the structure, have suffered strong denudation effect, and the secondary pores have formed in the weathering and tectonic burial stages, but primary pores are not developed within the early diagenesis stage. Average porosity is only at 8 %, and the maximum porosity is at 13. 5 %, with oil and gas accumulation showing poor performance. (2) Intermediate andesite and basic basalt reservoirs are mainly distributed near the crater, which resembles the size of and suggests a volcanic eruption. Primary pores are formed in the early diagenetic stage, secondary pores developed in weathering and erosion transformation stage, and secondary fractures formed in the tectonic burial stage. The average porosity is at 9. 2 %, and the maximum porosity is at 21. 9 %: it is of the high-quality reservoir types in Dixi area. (3) The <b>volcanic</b> <b>breccia</b> reservoir has the same diagenetic features with sedimentary rocks, but also has the same mineral composition with volcanic rock; rigid components can keep the primary porosity without being affected by compaction during the burial process. At the same time, the brittleness of <b>volcanic</b> <b>breccia</b> reservoir makes it easily fracture under the stress; internal fracture was developmental. <b>Volcanic</b> <b>breccia</b> developed in the structural high part and suffered a long-term leaching effect. The original pore-fracture combination also made <b>volcanic</b> <b>breccia</b> reservoir more easily leached by fresh water or groundwater, leading to secondary erosion pores. Volcanic rock weathering obviously has control on reservoir properties, and while {{the thickness of the}} weathering crust is 200 – 300  m, the properties of volcanic rock reservoir are the best. This is attributed mainly to the period during and after the volcano eruption, in which tectonism made the brittle volcanic rock develop a large number of fractures and micro cracks. This has led to the increased permeability of volcanic rock reservoir, the weathering and leaching effect of volcanic rock diagenetic late phase (which also formed lots of secondary pores), and greatly improved reservoir conditions. The overlying Permian Wutonggou formation mudstone provided high-quality cap rock for oil and gas accumulation...|$|R
