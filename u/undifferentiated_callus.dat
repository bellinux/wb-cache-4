When cultured with auxin but no cytokinin, they grow large but do not divide. When cytokinin is added, the cells expand and differentiate. When cytokinin and auxin are present in equal levels, the parenchyma cells form an <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>callus.</b> More cytokinin induces growth of shoot buds, while more auxin induces root formation.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} aseptic culture methods for higher plants is presented, {{which focuses on}} the {{existing}} problems that limit or prevent the full realization of cloning plants from free cells. It is shown that substantial progress in clonal multiplication has been made with explanted stem tips or lateral buds which can be stimulated to produce numerous precocious axillary branches. These branches can then be separated or subdivided and induced to root in order to yield populations of genetically and phenotypically uniorm plantlets. Similarly, <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>calluses</b> can sometimes be induced to form shoots and/or roots adventitiously. Although the cell culture techniques required to produce somatic embryos are presently rudimentary, steady advances are being made in learning how to stimulate formation of somatic or adventive embryos from totipotent cells grown in suspension cultures.

Similar effects were obtained on total hemes and on catalase which is a hemoprotein used as marker. The effect of ERT, which is an inhibitor of plastid differentiation and of chlorophyll synthesis, was reversed in the N callus by a supply of glycine and succinate.

A further synergistic effect was achieved when gibberellic acid (10 − 5 mol dm 3) was added to a highly inductive medium containing 0. 5 × 10 − 4 mol dm 3 IBA + 10 − 6 mol dm 3 benzyladenine. Of the carbohydrates tested, sucrose at levels of 2 and 3 % gave the best results. While autoclaving resulted in the pyrolysis of sucrose, this apparently did not affect xylogenesis adversely.

50|$|In {{plant tissue}} culture IBA and other auxins are used to {{initiate}} root formation in vitro in a procedure called micropropagation. Micropropagation of plants {{is the process of}} using small samples of plants called explants and causing them to undergo growth of differentiated or undifferentiated cells.

Lowering the BAP level to 4. 44 micromoles (1 mg/l) but maintaining the NAA level, gave rise to organized but highly compressed shoot growing points from an otherwise <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>callus</b> mass.

The stem tip multiplication rates obtainable by these means permit reliable strategies for shoot multiplication or production of rooted plantlets.

40|$|Mutations at five loci named PEANUT 1 - 5 (PNT) were {{identified}} in a genetic screen for radially swollen embryo mutants. pnt 1 cell walls showed decreased crystalline cellulose, increased pectins, and irregular and ectopic deposition of pectins, xyloglucans, and callose. Furthermore, pnt 1 pollen is less viable than the wild type, and pnt 1 embryos were delayed in morphogenesis and showed defects in shoot and root meristems. The PNT 1 gene encodes the Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of mammalian PIG-M, an endoplasmic reticulum–localized mannosyltransferase that is required for synthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. All five pnt mutants showed strongly reduced accumulation of GPI-anchored proteins, suggesting that they all have defects in GPI anchor synthesis.

Crosses of the mutant to marker strains showed that the mutation is closely linked to the tt 3 locus on chromosome 5. In addition to Cd, the mutants are also significantly more sensitive to mercuric ions and only slightly more sensitive to Cu and Zn, while being no more sensitive than the wild type to Mn, thus indicating a degree of specificity in the mechanism affected by the mutation. <b>Undifferentiated</b> <b>callus</b> tissue is also Cd sensitive, suggesting that the mutant phenotype is expressed at the cellular level. Both wild-type and mutant plants showed increased sensitivity to Cd in the presence of buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of the biosynthesis of the cadmium-binding (γ-glutamylcysteine) n-glycine peptides, suggesting that the mutant is still able to synthesize these peptides.

It has been suggested that co-ordinate control of multiple steps of the pathway with the help of regulatory genes would lead to a more predictable control of metabolic flux. Regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis has been studied in a common ornamental plant, Gerbera hybrida (Asteraceae). An R 2 R 3 -type MYB factor, GMYB 10, shares high sequence similarity and is phylogenetically grouped together with previously characterized regulators of anthocyanin pigmentation. Ectopic expression of GMYB 10 leads to strongly enhanced accumulation of anthocyanin pigments as well as to an altered pigmentation pattern in transgenic gerbera plants. Anthocyanin analysis indicates that GMYB 10 specifically induces cyanidin biosynthesis in <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>callus</b> and in vegetative tissues.

40|$|For {{the last}} 50 years, {{scientists}} {{have recognized that}} varying ratios of the plant hormones cytokinin and auxin induce plant cells to form particular tissues: undifferentiated calli, shoot structures, root structures, or a whole plant. Proliferation of <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>callus</b> tissue, greening, {{and the formation of}} shoot structures are all cytokinin-dependent processes. Habituation refers to a naturally occurring phenomenon whereby callus cultures, upon continued passage, lose their requirement for cytokinin. Earlier studies of calli with a higher-than-normal cytokinin content indicate that overproduction of cytokinin by the culture tissues is a possible explanation for this acquired cytokinin independence. A transcriptome-based analysis of a well established habituated Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cell culture line was undertaken, to explore genome-wide expression changes underlying the phenomenon of habituation. Increased levels of expression of the cytokinin receptor CRE 1, as well as altered levels of expression of several other genes involved in cytokinin signaling, indicated that naturally acquired deregulation of cytokinin-signaling components could play a previously unrecognized role in habituation. Up-regulation of several cytokinin oxidases, down-regulation of several known cytokinin-inducible genes, and a lack of regulation of the cytokinin synthases indicated that increases in hormone concentration may not be required for habituation. In addition, up-regulation of the homeodomain transcription factor FWA, transposon-related elements, and several DNA- and chromatin-modifying enzymes indicated that epigenetic changes contribute to the acquisition of cytokinin habituation...|$|E

Germination of Gl. etunicatum chlamydospores was inhibited by gentamicin, and hyphal growth was sensitive to higher concentrations of chloramphenicol and gentamicin. Higher levels of chloramphenicol also reduced germination and hyphal growth of Gi. rosea. Effects of other antibiotics were dependent upon their concentration and VAMF species. No significant correlation was found between spore diameter and hyphal growth for either VAMF species. Hyphal growth by Gi. rosea was, however, highly correlated with the number of extra-matrical vesicle clusters that were produced upon each hypha. When extra-matrical vesicle clusters became separated by a septum from the parental hypha, they occasionally generated a new radial mass of thin hyphae. Chlamydospores of Gl. etunicatum occasionally germinated directly through the spore wall, and hyphae from separate spores in close proximity frequently anastomosed;Light and scanning electron microscopy were utilized to observe various anatomical aspects in the development of Gi. rosea and Gl. etunicatum.

40|$|In sexually {{reproducing}} individuals, intraorganismal {{genetic heterogeneity}} (IGH) or mosaicism {{is thought to}} occur infrequently while genetic homogeneity is presumed the norm. In organisms that undergo modular development, such as long-lived plants, IGH has been substantially documented. In Arabidopsis thaliana we have shown that non-parental DNA that is inherited at low but detectable rates can also manifest on single plants as genotypically distinct somatic sectors suggesting that even short-lived annual plants show IGH. The underlying mechanism responsible for generating this type of IGH remains unknown. In order to better understand this phenomenon I have tested the hypothesis that among genome changes that occur in response to stress, these putative triggers also up-regulate IGH. Metabolic stress, cold stress, mechanical damage and ROS exposure were examined. To test for IGH, transgene markers and polymorphic molecular markers were used. Also, presented in this thesis is work investigating the effect of in vitro propagation through tissue culture on IGH frequencies. Regenerated plants as well as <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>callus</b> tissue were genotyped and assayed for sequence reversions. Molecular genotyping revealed an outcome contrary to that predicted by the initial hypothesis showing instead that a high frequency of restoration occurred in the progeny of un-treated control plants.

The availability of some information related to this species’ CWs allows researching its responses to imposed conditions that affect the plant’s development. Mineral deficiency, in particular nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur, strongly affects plant metabolism, reducing both growth and crop yield. Despite the importance of mineral nutrition in development, its influence on CW synthesis and modifications is still insufficiently documented. Addressing this knowledge gap, V. vinifera experimental models were used to study CW responses to imposed mineral depletion in unorganized (callus) and organized (shoots) tissues. The discussion of the obtained results is the main focus of this review. Callus and shoots submitted to mineral restriction are impaired in specific CW components, predominantly cellulose. Reorganization on structure and deposition of several other polymers, in particular the degree and pattern of pectin methyl-esterification and the amount of xyloglucan (XyG), arabinan and extensin, is also observed. In view of recently proposed CW models that consider biomechanical hotspots and direct linkages between pectins and XyG/cellulose, the outcome of these modifications in explaining maintenance of CW integrity through compensatory stiffening can be debated. Nutrient stresses do not affect evenly all tissues with <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>callus</b> tissues showing more pronounced responses, followed by shoot mature internodes, and then newly formed internodes. The impact of nitrogen depletion leads to more noticeable responses, supporting this nutrient’s primary role in plant development and metabolism. The consequential compensatory mechanisms highlight the pivotal role of CW in rearranging under environmental stresses...|$|E
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{functions of}} Ku 70 in repair of DNA double-stranded breaks and telomere regulation {{have been described}} {{in a wide range}} of organisms. In this study, we identified the rice (Oryza sativa) Ku 70 homolog (OsKu 70) from the rice genome database. OsKu 70 transcript was detected constitutively in every tissue and developmental stage examined and also in <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>callus</b> cells in rice. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down experiments revealed that OsKu 70 physically interacts with OsKu 80. We obtained loss-of-function osku 70 T-DNA knockout mutant lines and constructed transgenic rice plants that overexpress the OsKu 70 gene in the sense (35 S:OsKu 70) or antisense (35 S:anti-OsKu 70) orientation. The homozygous G 2 osku 70 mutant lines were more sensitive than wild-type plants to a DNA-damaging agent (0. 01 %– 0. 05 % methyl-methane sulfonate), consistent with the notion that OsKu 70 participates in the DNA repair mechanism. Terminal restriction fragment analysis revealed that telomeres in homozygous G 2 osku 70 mutants were markedly longer (10 – 20 kb) than those in wild-type plants (5 – 10 kb), whereas telomere length in heterozygous G 2 osku 70 mutant and T 2 OsKu 70 -overexpressing transgenic (35 S:OsKu 70) rice resembled that of the wild-type plant. In contrast to what was observed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) atku 70 mutants, homozygous G 2 osku 70 rice plants displayed severe developmental defects in both vegetative and reproductive organs under normal growth conditions, resulting in sterile flowers. Analysis of meiotic progression in pollen mother cells demonstrated that up to 11. 1 % (seven of 63) of G 2 mutant anaphase cells displayed one or more chromosomal fusions. These results suggest that OsKu 70 is required for the maintenance of chromosome stability and normal developmental growth in rice plants...|$|E
40|$|Micropropagation {{has been}} widely used to produce better crops at a rapid rate. Plant growth {{regulators}} are used to increase shoot proliferation, with benzylaminopurine (BAP) being {{the most commonly used}} cytokinin. However, various studies have shown that BAP concentration affects the frequency of abnormality in banana micropropagation. For this study, the effects of BAP concentrations on in vitro cultures of Musa acuminata cv. “Berangan” were investigated and it was found that on Murashige and Skoog (MS) media supplemented with concentrations of 9 mgL- 1 and 12 mgL- 1 BAP, cultures took a longer time to regenerate as compared to concentrations of 3 mgL- 1 and 6 mgL- 1. Abnormalities such as having abnormal shoot clusters and remaining in an <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>callus</b> state were also observed on cultures of the higher BAP concentrations. Dwarf SCAR markers developed by Damasco et al. (1996) were used to analyze the genomic changes of the in vitro cultures via polymerase chain reaction. A single band of about 1. 6 kb present only on normal plants and absent in dwarfs would have been expected. However, instead of the predicted 1. 6 kb single band, two bands of 662 bp and 438 bp in length were observed regardless of the morphology of the regenerants produced (normal or stunted). A BLAST analysis of the 662 bp sequence did not reveal any homologous fragment but the 438 bp sequence was found to be homologous to fragments of the Musa acuminata clone BAC MA 4 - 3 F 3. Initially found to be hypothetical proteins, a further BLAST analysis using the banana genome revealed that these proteins would presumably be present in chromosome 6 and identified as the ubiquitin-fold modifier 1...|$|E

Transcriptional activation of the VERNALIZATION 1 gene mediates the acceleration of flowering by prolonged cold (vernalization) in temperate cereals. This study examined the earliest stages of the transcriptional response of VRN 1 to low temperatures. Time-course analyses, using a sensitive quantitative PCR assay, showed that in sprouting barley seedlings VRN 1 transcripts begin to accumulate within 24 hours of the onset of cold. The kinetics of the initial transcriptional response of VRN 1 to cold was similar to the cold-induced genes DEHYDRIN 5 (DHN 5) and COLD REGULATED 14 B (COR 14 B), but occurred at lower levels compared to cold acclimation genes or the response to longer cold treatments. Temperatures between 15 and – 2 °C induced expression of VRN 1 within 24 hours, with a maximal response observed between 2 and – 2 °C. Transcriptional induction was also observed in <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>callus</b> cells. There were significant increases in histone acetylation levels at the VRN 1 locus in response to 24 -hour cold treatment. Sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylation inhibitor, triggered an increase in histone acetylation at VRN 1 chromatin and elevated VRN 1 transcript levels. The transcriptional response of VRN 1 to short-term cold treatment was examined in near-isogenic lines that have different VRN 1 genotypes, showing that an allele of the barley VRN 1 gene with an insertion in the first intron and high basal expression levels has a reduced transcriptional response to short term cold treatment. This study suggests that low-temperature induction of VRN 1 is a cellular response to cold triggered by the same mechanisms that mediate low-temperature induction of cold acclimation genes. This work was supported by an Office of the Chief Executive (OCE) Postdoctoral fellowship (S. N Oliver). Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{tissue culture}} {{regeneration}} is chiefly regulated by exogenous phytohormones. To stop regeneration and induce <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>callus</b> growth auxins are used. Unfortunately auxins influence many plant responses, most unrelated to development. Using the thymidine analogue 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) a phytohormone independent means for differentiation inhibition has been developed. Studies {{were focused on}} the target site and mechanism of BrdU action. The BrdU inhibited step in development is indicative of a plant response necessary for normal differentiation. BrdU (5 - 30 uM) interrupts callus growth in all tested plants. Exogenous cytokinin does not restore growth while thymidine and deoxycytidine rescue plant growth and differentiation {{in the presence of}} BrdU. Endogenous cytokinin levels are not greatly affected by subtoxic BrdU levels and indicate that cytokinin and BrdU act upon independent sites. Domestic carrot cells were used in further studies. Normally carrot cells are undifferentiated in medium with the auxin 2, 4 D. When 2, 4 D is removed, somatic embryogenesis takes place. By including 5 uM BrdU in the hormoneless medium, the cells fail to differentiate. The growth of carrots in 2, 4 D is not affected by 5 uM BrdU. Thus, BrdU influences growth during differentiation {{to a greater extent than}} the growth of callus cells. BrdU is effective in halting development when applied 0 - 24 hours after differentiation induction. An event required for differentiation (the first and second replications) must take place at this time. BrdU action begins with DNA incorporation. The consequent cellular replication becomes slowed and DNA repair results. At the same time RNA and protein levels are similar in BrdU treated and untreated cultures. BrdU thymidine substitution into DNA increases from 28 % (2 days) to 68 % (3 days) after embryogenic induction. A second BrdU effect follows DNA incorporation. Factors (MIFs) in the medium of BrdU treated cells arrest differentiation. After BrdU is repaired from the DNA, the cells are only able to differentiate after a medium change. Understanding MIF production could explain why some plants differentiate more readily than others. BrdU provides the means for further study of MIF's in the auxin-free inhibition of development...|$|E

P. somniferum의 미분화 세포 현탁배양은 {{in vitro}}에서 알칼로이드를 생산하는 생물반응기(bioreactor) 로서 연구되어 왔으나, sanguinarine, chelirubin 등 benzophenanthridine alkaloids (BPAs) 가 주로 생산될 뿐, 몰핀계 알칼로이드는 생산되지 않는 것으로 보고되고 있다. 이는 조직 분화가 일어나지 않는 미분화 세포 시스템의 한계로 여겨지므로 본 연구에서는 P. somniferum의 현탁배양에서 이차대사 과정을 이해하고, 대사공학을 통해 미분화 세포에서의 몰핀 생산을 도모하고자 하였다. 식물 조직 및 세포 배양에서 유도물질(elicitor) 처리는 다양한 신호 전달 체계와 결합하여 식물 내 이차대사를 촉진한다. 유도물질 처리(elicitation) 기술은 식물 유래의 유용 화학 물질의 in vitro 생산성을 증대시킴으로써 식물세포 배양을 산업적으로 활용할 수 있는 가능성을 높인다. Sanguinarine 등의 BPAs를 주로 생산하는 또 다른 양귀비과 식물인 Eschscholtzia californica을 이스트 추출물 (yeast extract) 로 처리한 선행연구 결과, elicitation은 BPA 생합성의 모든 유전자를 동시에 과발현 시킴으로써 이차 대사 산물의 생산성을 극대화시키는 것으로 나타났다. 이에 동일한 기술을 P. somniferum에 적용하여 현탁배양되는 식물 세포 내의 BIAs 생합성 관련 모든 유전자가 과발현되고 따라서 몰핀계 알칼로이드가 생산될 것을 기대하였다. 그러나, 실험결과, P. somniferum에서 BIAs 합성 경로에 공통적인 유전자와 BPAs 합성경로 상의 유전자들은 모두 과발현이 유도된 것과 달리 몰핀계 알칼로이드 생합성 경로에 특이한 유전자들은 각기 다른 발현 양상을 나타내었다. Salutaridinol 7 -O-acetyltransferase (SAT) 과 codeinone reductase (COR) 은 elicitation에 의해 발현이 증가하였으나, salutaridine synthase (SS) 의 축적은 유도되지 않았으며, 특히 salutaridine reductase (SS) 는 elicitor 처리여부와 무관하게 미분화 세포에서는 발현하지 않았다. 이로부터, SR이 미분화세포의 몰핀계 알칼로이드 생합성 경로 대사공학에서 표적 유전자가 될 수 있음을 유추할 수 있었다. 이를 확증하기 위해, metabolomics, trasncriptomics, 및 proteomics 데이터를 아우르는 ‘integrated -omics study’를 실시하였는데, (1) 몰핀을 생산하지 않는 배양 세포와 morphine이 검출되는 식물 조직(잎, 뿌리, 줄기, 삭, 및 소식물체), (2) 미분화 세포와 이로부터 체세포배발생(somatic embryogenesis) 에 의해 유도된 체세포배 간의 대사산물, 유전자, 단백질의 발현을 비교하였다. 그 결과, 몰핀계 알칼로이드 축적에 관여하는 laticifer 조직에서 발현되는 major latex protein (MLP) 의 발현과 더불어 체세포배(somatic embryos) 에서 SR의 발현이 분화 여부에 따라 차별 유도(differential induction) 되는 것을 확인하였고, 이를 현탁배양 세포에서의 몰핀 생산을 위한 대사공학의 우선적인 표적 유전자로 선정하였다. 또한, 현재 양귀비과 식물에서 유전 정보가 알려져 있지 않은 thebaine과 codeine의 demethylation에 관여하는 O-demethylase (ODM) 반응에 대한 대사공학 여부를 알아보기 위하여 유사한 기질 특이성을 갖는 vanillate O-demethylase를 Pseudomonas sp. 로부터 분리하여 thebaine 및 codeine을 기질로 사용하는 것을 확인하였으며, 이를 바탕으로 P. somniferum의 thebaine/codeine O-demethylase의 partial sequence를 동정하였다. 미분화 세포의 경우, thebaine 및 codeine에 대한 demethylation 효소 활성을 가지고 있으므로, 본 연구에서는 앞서 선정된 SR에 대한 대사공학을 실시하여, 몰핀계 알칼로이드 생합성 경로를 조절하고자 하였다. Agrobacterium tumafaciens를 매개로 하여, SR을 P. somniferum 미분화 세포에서 과발현시키는 형질전환을 실시하였다. SR이 과발현된 식물세포에서는 SR 활성이 증가하였으며, 특히 몰핀계 알칼로이드의 생산성이 약 153. 6 µg/g DW으로 체세포배에 비하여 약 4. 5 배 증가한 것으로 나타났다. 또한 체세포배에서 morphine만이 생합성되던 것에 비해, SR-과발현 형질전환 세포에서는 morphine 35. 3 µg/g DW, thebaine 108. 6 µg/g DW 및 codeine 15. 3 µg/g DW이 모두 검출되어, SR-과발현에 의하여 몰핀계 알칼로이드 생합성 경로가 전체적으로 영향을 받음을 알 수 있었다. 본 연구를 통해, 양귀비과 식물인 Papaver somniferum에서 대사물질의 생산성이 다른 식물 조직을 대상으로 대사물질에 관여하는 유전자와 단백질의 발현 양상을 비교하여 적절한 대사공학 표적 유전자를 선정하고, 대사공학을 통해 미분화 세포의 몰핀계 알칼로이드 생산 경로를 조절할 수 있음을 밝혔다. Suspension cultures of Papaver somniferum {{have been studied}} as bioreactor systems for in vitro production of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) the plants produced. To stimulate BIA biosynthetic pathway in the suspension cultures, YE was applied as an elicitor. YE affected accumulation of benzophenanthridine alkaloids (chelirubine, sanguinarine, etc.) (BPAs) accompanying with accumulation of gene transcripts and proteins involved in BPAs biosynthesishowever, although salutaridinol 7 -O-acetyltransferase (SAT) and codeinone reductase (COR) were induced by elicitation, morphinan alkaloids such as thebaine, codeine and morphine were not detected in elicitor-treated suspension cultures. Elicitation using yeast extract may not enhance the morphine biosynthesis and targeted metabolic engineering might be needed to regulate secondary metabolism related to morphinan alkaloid biosynthesis in suspension cultures of P. somniferum. To determine the proper target gene for metabolic engineering, integrated -omics study was performed through comparative profiling of metabolite, gene transcripts and proteins between morphine-free undifferentiated cells and morphine-containing plant tissues of P. somniferum. Of BIAs biosynthetic enzymes, salutaridine reductase (SR) was differentially expressed in morphine-producing plant tissues, which implied that SR would be under developmental regulation and could be a possible target for metabolic engineering for in vitro morphine production in suspension cultures. For investigating developmental regulation of gene transcript and protein expression, somatic embryogenesis was induced from <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>callus</b> and the BIAs biosynthesis in both somatic embryos and callus was monitored in terms of metabolites, gene transcripts and proteins. Results showed that all genes and proteins related to morphine-specific biosynthesis were up-regulated by somatic embryogenesis. Differential induction of SR following somatic embryos might be resulted from the development of laticifer tissues in <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>callus,</b> which was confirmed by differential expression of major latex protein (MLP), the most abundant protein in opium poppy laticifer where morphine accumulates in intact plants. O-demethylation of thebain and codeine is essential to synthesize morphine, but the molecular information on O-demethylase of P. somniferum has never been reported up to now. Pseudomonas sp. vanillate O-demethylase showing the substrate specificity to chemicals of similar structure to morphine, was selected as a template enzyme to characterize demethylating activity in opium poppy. Based on the result from experiments on O-demethylating activity of P. somniferum, undifferentiated cells also had O-demethylase activity, thus this step was not attempt to modulate via metabolic engineering. SR-activated opium poppy transgenic callus were generated via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The transformants showed up-regulation of SR produced thebaine, codeine and morphine 4. 5 times higher than somatic embryos, which might be attributed to expression of SR even in undifferentiated cells. In this study, we suggest (1) integrated -omics through comparative profiling of metabolite, gene transcript and protein expression can provide information on selecting proper target gene for metabolic engineering(2) inability of undifferentiated opium poppy cells to biosynthesize morphinan alkaloids may be resulted from developmental regulation of the related pathwayand (3) in vitro morphinan alkaloid production {{can be achieved by}} targeted metabolic engineering to activate genes which are developmentally regulated. We expect that our results and the methods for analysis of morphine-specific biosynthetic pathway will contribute the in vitro production of morphinan alkaloids in plant cell culture and understanding of the secondary metabolism at the molecular level...|$|E
40|$|GMO dwarf plum (Prunus domestica) {{is being}} {{evaluated}} {{as a candidate}} food crop for long duration space flight missions. A project was undertaken to develop a protocol for transferring selected genetic lines of GMO plum (previously maintained in pots and propagated by cuttings at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida) into in vitro tissue culture. In vitro culture may reduce the space, materials, and labor required to maintain the current lines of GMO plum and better preserve them for future study. Fresh plant material from three selected GMO plum lines (NASA- 5, NASA- 10, and NASA- 11) and a non-modified control line (Control- 5) were processed aseptically into in vitro culture on four separate occasions. The impact of multiple treatments on the successful growth of GMO plum tissue in vitro were tested: Parent explant tissue type (leaf petioles, stem nodes containing buds and internodes without buds), tissue sterilization method [soaking in 10 bleach only (5 min for petioles or 10 min for nodesinternodes), or soaking in 70 EtOH (30 sec) followed by 10 bleach (5 min for petioles and 10 min for nodesinternodes) ], and media type [three Murashige and Skoog-based medias (SGM, SRM, and SRM+ 2, 4 -D) and one recipe containing woody plant media (WPM) ]. 22. 2 of the plates containing tissue sterilized with bleach alone developed microbial contamination after two weeks, while only 11. 8 of plates containing tissue sterilized sequentially with EtOH and bleach developed contamination. Node bud tissue from all four genetic lines of plum produced leafy plantlets on SGM and SRM media after 4 - 6 weeks. The most numerous and well-developed plantlets were present on SGM. Upon reaching suitable size, plantlets were transferred to larger media containers for further growth. Some node bud growth occurred on SRM+ 2, 4 -D and WPM 2. 5 weeks after plating, however as of yet no pieces on SRM+ 2, 4 -D have adequate development for transferring. Tissue pieces from NASA- 5 plated on WPM are developing leaves and {{will be ready for}} transferring soon. Petioles and internode tissue lacking bud meristem failed to produce any plantlets on any plates, however petioles developed large masses of <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>callus</b> tissue on SRM+ 2, 4 -D media. These callused pieces were then transferred to SRM+TDZ media, which resulted in even larger callus growth but no differentiation. All four selected plum lines were successfully transitioned into in vitro culture. Nodes from NASA- 5 and NASA- 10 lines produced the most numerous and well-developed leafy plantlets in vitro, while those from NASA- 11 and Control- 5 were generally smaller, slower growing and less numerous. The best method overall was to use young stem node tissue with buds, surface sterilize the pieces sequentially with 70 EtOH and 10 bleach, and then plate them onto SGM media. Future areas of study will include introducing additional genetic lines of GMO plum into in vitro culture, attempting to induce shoot growth in petiole callus tissue, testing methods (such as cold storage) that extend the time interval between transferring explants into new media, and testing viability of plantlets transferred from in vitro culture back to traditional pot culture...|$|E
