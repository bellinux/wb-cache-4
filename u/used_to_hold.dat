5|$|The Bastille was {{occasionally}} <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> prisoners, {{including its}} creator, Hugues Aubriot, {{who was the}} first person to be imprisoned there. In 1417, in addition to being a royal fortress, it formally became a state prison.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th {{century the}} grounds were {{turned into a}} garden. The castle's defences were {{enhanced}} in the 1640s to prepare the castle for action in the English Civil War. Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke, was a Parliamentarian, and Royalist forces laid siege to the castle. Warwick Castle withstood the siege and was later <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> prisoners taken by the Parliamentarians.|$|E
5|$|The new castle was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> French prisoners {{taken in}} at Poitiers in 1357, {{including}} John II, who {{was held for}} a considerable ransom. Later in the century, the castle also found favour with Richard II. Richard conducted restoration work on St George's Chapel, the work being carried out by Geoffrey Chaucer, {{who served as a}} diplomat and Clerk of The King's Works.|$|E

5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out of sync with normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it had its}} own {{branch line}} into Brookwood Cemetery, most of {{the route of the}} London Necropolis Railway ran on the {{existing}} London and South Western Railway (LSWR). Consequently, a site was selected in Waterloo, near the LSWR's recently opened London terminus at Waterloo Bridge station (now London Waterloo). The building was specifically designed for the use of mourners. It had many private waiting rooms, which could also be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> funeral services, and a hydraulic lift to raise coffins to platform level. Existing railway arches were used for the storage of bodies.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} castle was {{becoming}} less fashionable as a residence. Goodrich was too distant from London to {{be a useful}} power base, and was gradually abandoned in favour of more stylish residences, Goodrich continued {{to be used as}} a judicial centre however; the antiquarian John Leland noted that some of the castle was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> prisoners for the local court during the 1530s, and the castle ditch was sometimes used to store confiscated cattle taken from local farmers.|$|E
50|$|Many {{consider}} proactive {{disclosure and}} the ability to have access to information as a way to watch over those in power within society. This is especially true for governments who collect a wide range of information, which citizens often <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the government accountable.|$|R

Most have two dorsal fins, the first made up from spiny fin rays, while the other has some spines in the front followed by numerous soft rays.|$|R
5|$|During {{the later}} {{stages of the}} Second World War, the bailey was {{levelled}} and <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a set of temporary Nissen huts that formed a hospital for United States Army personnel. In 1945, the site was leased by the Air Ministry for use as offices. The Ministry of Works took over the guardianship of the castle in 1951. The ministry {{put pressure on the}} Air Ministry to leave the site, which occurred in 1956; the bailey was then grassed over again. Archaeological excavations were carried out in the bailey between 1961 and 1982, uncovering many of the medieval buildings.|$|E
5|$|Land {{immediately}} {{south of}} the priory {{was used by the}} Chaloners for formal gardens attached to Old Gisborough Hall. In the early 18th century they planted an oval-shaped double avenue of trees, the Monks' Walk, where stonework recovered from mid-19th century excavations was deposited. In between the trees was a manicured lawn <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> musical and theatrical productions. The Monks' Walk fell into disuse and became overgrown but is under restoration by the Gisborough Priory Project.|$|E
5|$|The Nice were {{primarily}} a live band. Their stage performances were bold and violent, with Emerson incorporating feedback and distortion. He manhandled his Hammond L-100 organ, wrestling it and attacking it with daggers (which he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> down keys and sustain notes during these escapades). Emerson's playing {{was inspired by}} Jimi Hendrix, Billy Ritchie of Clouds, and Don Shinn as well as earlier figures such as pianist Jerry Lee Lewis.|$|E

Police notebooks themselves also have to stand up to harsh environments such as wind and rain, therefore the paper used is usually waterproof and untearable.|$|R
5|$|The castle {{continued}} to fulfil several other local functions. During {{the outbreak of}} plague in 1666, the castle {{was used as an}} isolation ward for infected patients, and during the Napoleonic Wars the castle was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the equipment and stores of the local Framlingham Volunteer regiment. Following the closure of the poorhouse, the castle was then used as a drill hall and as a county court, as well as containing the local parish jail and stocks.|$|E
5|$|While castles were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a {{site and}} control {{movement}} of armies, in the Holy Land some key strategic positions were left unfortified. Castle architecture in the East became more complex around the late 12th and early 13thcenturies after the stalemate of the Third Crusade (1189–1192). Both Christians and Muslims created fortifications, {{and the character}} of each was different. Saphadin, the 13th-century ruler of the Saracens, created structures with large rectangular towers that influenced Muslim architecture and were copied again and again, however they had little influence on Crusader castles.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} development, {{the family}} created a large, new deer park around the castle, {{replacing}} the older, unenclosed hunting grounds. Deer parks were an important status symbol in this period, and many nobles who acquired power and wealth {{for the first time}} chose to undertake similar projects. Creating the park, which spread out from the south of the castle to cover , required clearing away the older settlements around the castle and abandoning various fields and pastures. These settlements, comprising long houses built in warmer climate of the 12th and early 13th century, may already have become less sustainable due to the onset of the cooler climate that began to emerge {{at the end of the}} 13th. Land near the castle, later called Kennel Field, was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> required the packs of dogs for hunting.|$|E

50|$|Another type of mandrel is {{the chuck}} that a lathe <b>uses</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> pieces of wood, metal or plastic to be {{machined}} as they are turned. In this way, rods can be threaded, furniture legs are turned to have æsthetic patterns, and irregularly-shaped objects can be given a round shape. There are several types of mandrels used with lathes. Original expanding mandrels have a slightly tapered wedge that will expand <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the item.|$|R

5|$|At 22:30 the fog {{lifted and}} Kouma {{saw that a}} North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river {{directly}} in front of his position. Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E
5|$|Chard was a {{key point}} on the Taunton Stop Line, a World War II {{defensive}} line consisting of pillboxes and anti-tank obstacles, which runs from Axminster north to the Somerset coast near Highbridge. In 1938 a bomb proof bunker was built behind the branch of the Westminster Bank. During the war it was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> duplicate copies of the bank records in case its headquarters in London was destroyed. It was also used to store the emergency bank note supply of the Bank of England. There has also been speculation that the Crown Jewels were also stored there, however this has never been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In May 1648, a Royalist {{rebellion}} {{broke out}} in Kent. There were fresh Parliamentary concerns about Henry Hastings and fears grew that he might reoccupy Ashby de la Zouch Castle. Lord Grey - a rival of the Hastings family in Leicestershire - {{was put in charge}} of the castle in August, which was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> Royalist prisoners, including James Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton. Parliamentary worries about the security of the castle persisted and, possibly because of Henry's involvement in the recent rebellion, William Bainbrigg was ordered in November to slight the castle to put it beyond military use. He carried out his orders immediately, demolishing one side of the Great Tower and the Kitchen Tower, undermining the foundations and deploying gunpowder charges.|$|E

5|$|In Saw, Jigsaw {{has just}} {{concluded}} the bathroom trap of Lawrence Gordon and Adam Stanheight, {{an incident that}} occurred {{at the end of}} the first film. David Tapp, a police officer who had his throat damaged by Jigsaw's knife and was later shot in the chest by a suspect named Zep Hindle, has been healed and is brought to Whitehurst insane asylum, an abandoned sanitarium with a reputation for medieval tactics and frequent patient abuse. The asylum has many areas, most of which contain a key trap scene for Tapp to solve. A large part of the asylum consists of cells that were at one time <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the criminally insane. Jigsaw placed traps all around the asylum to continue his tests of will for Detective Tapp and his apprentice, Amanda Young, who monitors Tapp as the story progresses.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{east from}} the Water Gate, the {{south-eastern}} curtain defences and the south-east bastion were rebuilt {{at the start}} of the 20th century to hold emplacements for four quick-firing guns and two 6-inch (15 cm) guns, with underground tunnels linking to an underground magazine. Four artillery pieces, dating from 1898 to 1942, are on display. Facing the parade ground are the officers' quarters, a terrace of houses probably dating in its current form to the late 18th century, with a stables at the northern end, originally <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the commandant's horses. It now holds the Bernard Truss collection of military memorabilia. The north-east bastion was redesigned after 1868 and contains an earth-covered magazine, as well as emplacements for 9-inch (22 cm) rifled muzzle loading guns.|$|E
5|$|Of the 20 bits {{allocated}} for each program instruction, 10 were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the instruction code, which allowed for 1,024 (210) different instructions. The machine had 26 initially, increasing to 30 when the function codes to programmatically control the data transfer between the magnetic drum and the {{cathode ray tube}} (CRT) main store were added. On the Intermediary Version programs were input by key switches, and the output was displayed {{as a series of}} dots and dashes on a cathode ray tube known as the output device, just as on the SSEM from which the Mark 1 had been developed. However, the Final Specification machine, completed in October 1949, benefitted from the addition of a teleprinter with a 5-hole paper-tape reader and punch.|$|E
