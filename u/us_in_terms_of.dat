500|$|Another step to {{move the}} game from the {{apparent}} hip-hop nature was through its song selection.

Jackson noted {{that they were able to}} work better with artists and publishers for DJ Hero 2, after the successful launch of the first game; with artists and publishers now knowing what to expect, [...] "there is more understanding, so it has opened the doors to <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> getting more popular music", according to Jackson. [...] However, licensing for such music remained a difficult barrier. Mixes for DJ Hero 2 are made first through computer-aided mixing of the two song tracks combined with effects noises, with simultaneous authoring of the gameplay markers. Noise for the scratching sections are filled in by recording the sounds of the tracks actually scratched on a DJ deck.|$|E

2500|$|... This {{theory is}} based on the United Kennel Club's (the leading 'working dog' {{registry}} in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> numbers of dogs registered) classification system which, within the scenthounds, includes a sub-group known as [...] "cur dogs". Contrary to the traditional/historical meaning of the term [...] "cur", these dogs are neither mongrels, nor dogs of dubious breeding or value. Quite the contrary, the UKC cur-dogs are pure-bred, versatile hunting and livestock dogs. These pure breeds were typically developed by pioneering people who needed a dog that was highly protective of the family and farm, as well as a capable stock driver. Most importantly the dog was required to pursue various species of game both small and large game alike, in a manner inconsistent {{with the rest of the}} hounds (sight or scent). The cur-dog does so using all of its senses - hearing, sight, and scent as the situation demands. This classification theory is consistent with old breed descriptions, which are somewhat contrary to the more classical sighthound/scenthound types, like the one offered in an advertisement run by the Rhodesian Parent Club in a show catalogue in 1926, [...] "...Rhodesian ridgeback (lion dogs) are unsurpassed for hunting and veld work.
