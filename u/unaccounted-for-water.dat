40|$|Water is an {{important}} natural resource, indispensable for life and also the backbone of growth and prosperity for mankind. Kenya is a water scarce country with renewable fresh water per capita at 647 m 3 against the United Nations recommended minimum of 1, 000 m 3. Despite the efforts made by the Government of Kenya, <b>Unaccounted-for-Water</b> (UFW) is still high, currently standing at 49 %. The overall objective {{for this study was}} to assess the strategies for reducing UFW in water supply systems. The scope focused in identifying areas for improving the water supply systems at NAWASSCO. The target population was 296, out of which 42 were employees of RVWSB and 254 were employees of NAWASSCO. Data was collected through interviews and questionnaires and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Descriptive statistics such as, bar graphs, percentages and means were used to present the results. The research findings indicate that majority of employees working in water supply systems are in operations level, considering that majority are diploma holders, their capacity should be enhanced. The research confirmed that on average, the level of <b>Unaccounted-for-Water</b> at NAWASSCO was at 45 %, this is in concurrence with the 2010 Impact Report by WASREB. It was further established that implementation of appropriate strategies t...|$|E
40|$|Improving and {{safeguarding}} {{wastewater management}} {{and water quality}} are vital for all three dimensions of sustainable development. Demand for water is growing at {{twice the rate of}} population growth. Without effective strategies to manage wastewater production, its treatment and reuse, development will be constrained and the resulting negative impacts, particularly on water-scarce economies, will arrive sooner than predicted by current approaches. Reducing <b>unaccounted-for-water,</b> or making beneficial use of water which is reused or recycled, are the most readily available ways to preserve water resources and to reduce the demand on finite freshwater resources. Preventing and removing pollution is essential to maintain the renew-ability of a renewable resource. For most uses of water, quality is as important as quantity. Many water resources are rapidly degraded by poor disposal of wastewater and in some case the economic cost of treatment makes them unsuitable as a source downstrea...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempted}} to address possible solutions to water demand management {{for the improvement}} of efficient use of a given volume of water while increasing water access to new users; application of water demand management tools both at the utility and end-user sides; and managing water losses in the distribution network which is a critical aspect of water demand management. The research was conducted in Garankuwa and Mabopane supplied by ODI Water Services in South Africa. This paper describes water resources in South Africa, water demand management tools in place and water supply to the ODI Water Services. It further presents data for the total purchases of water from Rand water and the final billed water at the utility, and water consumption patterns during the period of July to December 2009. This included attempts made to identify and quantify water losses in Garankuwa and Mabopane during the same period. Suggestions were made on how water losses can be reduced. In Garankuwa and Mabopane it was discovered that human perceptions on water demand management and water wastage through <b>unaccounted-for-water</b> together with the indigenous knowledge systems for th...|$|E
40|$|Lagos, {{the fastest}} growing city in Africa is {{currently}} facing a water management crisis. Due to poor planning, lack of adequate infrastructure, insufficient funds, and a poor governance and regulatory framework, there is a vast demand gap of 330 MGD. As such, only 10 % {{of the population in}} Lagos is being served by the public water utility, Lagos Water Corporation. The rest of the population gain access to water either from private boreholes or from informal private sector participants such as water vendors. This situation is further worsened by certain factors such as rapid population growth, corruption, climate change, unreliable electricity, inadequate enforcement, and water leakages and theft that cause 60 % <b>unaccounted-for-water</b> losses. As a result, citizens experience water shortages, water pollution, inadequate sanitation and wastewater treatment, and water injustice and inequality. There have been several governmental and external efforts to resolve the crisis, however they have all been fruitless due to poor implementation, inefficient enforcement, inadequate financing and lacking water governance. The Lagos Water Supply Master Plan aims to cover the demand gap by 2020 and improve water supply through extensive infrastructure development, however this plan is non-comprehensive and one-dimensional. Lagos needs a water supply plan that includes plans and strategies to address all the gaps and challenges that the Lagos water supply system faces. It is my goal to create a plan that would incorporate demand-side management, reduce waste and unaccounted water losses, ensure improved service delivery, restructure regulatory and governance frameworks, enhance reinvestment, and increase access to potable water. This professional report will delve into the water supply crisis facing Lagos State. I will explore the geographical and political conditions in the city; explain the causes and illustrate the factors that exacerbate the water supply issues; define the barriers to resolution; and explore the efforts made by the state to resolve the water supply crisis. I will assess the effectiveness of these efforts and by highlighting the gaps and challenges faced, I aim to illustrate the importance of effective planning and management to ensure a sustainable water supply system. I hope to provide planning and management strategies that could rectify the severe water supply issues that Lagos is facing and if implemented would ensure a sustainable water supply system in Lagos...|$|E
40|$|Until {{recently}} {{climate change}} adaptation {{was not on the}} agenda of international climate negotiations. Only at the 7 th Conference of the Parties in 2001 in Marrakech, the particular vulnerability of developing countries to climate change and the need for adaptation was recognised. At the COP 15 in 2009 in Copenhagen the importance of the private sector in funding adaptation projects was emphasised amid the global economic crisis and the public sector’s inability to finance adaptation projects alone. In the Middle East water scarcity presents one of the largest challenges of the future, worsened by climate change. This thesis highlights the importance of adaptation to climate change, with particular focus on the water sector in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, a country which has been identified as a prime example of an emerging economy and Middle Income Country with one of the lowest freshwater availabilities per capita in the world. Despite water scarcity, water usage and management is inefficient, levels of <b>unaccounted-for-water</b> are high and agriculture consumes around two thirds of water resources on extremely low tariffs. At the same time, Jordan’s economy has suffered considerably under the economic crisis, and as an emerging economy is not able to independently finance projects to improve water management and access to safe drinking water over the long term. Jordan will therefore be heavily dependent on foreign development aid as well as private sector investments. Consequently, Jordan was chosen by the author as it makes a good case study for analysis. The thesis aims to identify the drivers and barriers to private sector responses to water scarcity in Jordan and will produce a set of policy recommendations for attracting private sector capital to invest in, what has been identified as, adaptation technologies in a resource poor country. These guidelines will be useful to policymakers and private companies alike. The recommendations given herein provide a basis for enhancing private sector investments in the water sector in Jordan. Though they are specific to Jordan, these recommendations are valid and can be translated to other scenarios under which a Middle Income Country government aims to attract private sector finance for {{climate change adaptation}} projects provided that similar political, economic, cultural and environmental conditions prevail: 1. Eliminate corruption 2. Create long-term prospects for investors (especially under uncertainty about climate change and its effects) 3. Build confidence for investors 4. Develop a solid legislative framework and risk-sharing scheme 5. Adaptation makes business sense: open adaptation to climate change as a new market for innovation and investments 6. Achieve high levels of transparency in the award of projects and contracts 7. Develop a regulatory framework that defines the water consumption for agriculture (proportionate to GDP and available water resources) 8. Ensure consistency and coherence in policy-making. Avoid an implementation deficit 9. Frame a trend in climate that requires an adaptation strategy in the context of climate changeOpen Acces...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2004. A company cannot {{survive without}} giving {{attention}} to quality. Ensuring quality in products {{is so important}} that many companies give major attention to actively managing processes {{to make sure that}} quality permeates everything the company does. Quality management is a company's unique approach for addressing all aspects of quality. It requires vision, a quality policy, a quality standard, a quality system and the control of the system. The water industry is a natural monopoly in which no competition exists to provide customers the opportunity to choose between different suppliers. Due to the monopolistic nature of a water utility, the tendency was previously to neglect the customer and his needs. For water utilities, the quality of the product water has always been the important factor mainly because of their responsibility towards the protection of public health. The quality emphasis was mainly towards meeting the demands of the primary and secondary sector of the water industry that is to provide water of an acceptable standard to the customers. It was only during the 1980 's that water utilities became concerned about service quality in pursuance of the example set by the broader industry. Since then the emphasis on quality shifted gradually towards the tertiary sector of the water industry, the provision of quality services to the customer. The Namibia Water Corporations Act, 1997 requires that a performance contract should be concluded between the owners of the company (the State) and the Corporation. It further requires that the Namibia Water Corporation (NamWater) should formulate and maintain service standards in respect of the provision of water, services or facilities. As both these requirements are primarily based on efficiency, performance,achievements, cost-effectiveness and the optimum use of resources, {{there is a need to}} develop a system that will address all these aspects. This document describes the outcome of a study to develop a quality management system for NamWater that will address all these aspects, to identify shortcomings within NamWater and to monitor progress regarding meeting the quality standards on a continuous basis. Together with the development of a proposed quality policy document, this study also resulted in the compilation of a proposed set of service standards as prescribed by the Namibia Water Corporation Act of 1997. Performance gaps where existing practices in NamWater do not meet industry's best practice were identified by making use of performance indicators developed by the International Water Association (IWA) and the benchmarking exercise of the Water Utility Partnership (WUP). A set of performance indicators was developed to monitor the progress of NamWater in meeting standards on a continuous basis. The study concludes with a proposal for a quality management system for NamWater to ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with the quality policy and the quality standards. To identify possible performance gaps in NamWater, the information from the Water Utility Partnership programme on performance indicators and benchmarking was used to evaluate the performance of the NamWater against other water utilities in Africa. In general terms, the performance of NamWater is better than in many other African countries. However, by evaluating the results of the benchmarking exercise performance gaps were identified within NamWater that needs urgent attention. This study identifies the Sales Process as being the area to concentrate on as a first priority, with the focus on the improvement of revenue collection, the improvement of customer relations and the decrease in total cost. The Support Process should be the second priority with the improvement of the asset management organisation high on the list. There are two fields in the Production Process that needs special attention. They are <b>unaccounted-for-water,</b> and supply interruptions. The identification of industry's best performers in the various fields where performance gaps exist is beyond the scope of this study. It will form part of the implementation phase of a quality management system for NamWater. To monitor NamWater's performance on a continuous basis over time in meeting the requirements of the quality policy, various performance indicators have been identified. These indicators will also identify future performance gaps, determine various performance trends in the company, and measure and monitor the benefits of the implementation of best practice. Performance indicators were identified (from the IWA and WUP programmes) due to the fact that it will serve the abovementioned purpose and it is compatible with the present situation within NamWater. As can be seen from the performance gap analysis all three processes in the NamWater organisation have shortcomings that will have to be addressed through a quality management system. The situation is ideal for the implementation of TQM for NamWater. Such a project should be high on the priority list of the management of the company...|$|E
