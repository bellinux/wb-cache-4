In New Zealand, it is also one of the most common inshore sharks. While it is mainly a nocturnal forager, it may opportunistically feed on prey casually found during the day, however, research in 2010, found even amounts of activity during day and night. During this research, this shark was consistently detected at all depths from bottom to near surface whereas it was the substrate during the day. It also found that as Norfolk Bay does not have adequate shelter cover, this species may <b>use</b> <b>group</b> formation to avoid predation.|$|E

40|$|Key words: teaching, vocabulary, English Young Learner, {{grouping}} {{and organizing}} strategy Vocabulary {{is considered one}} of the foundations for the students as young learners of English as a foreign language. To be able to learn English well, a learner should master English skills and components. Vocabulary is also taken into account as underlying basic for learning English skills and other English component, namely pronunciation and grammar. Therefore, teaching vocabulary effectively needed to be considered, and one of the ways in teaching vocabulary is using strategy such as grouping and organizing vocabulary. Accordingly, the researcher <b>uses</b> <b>grouping</b> and organizing vocabulary as strategy to teach vocabulary which is intended to improve the student’s vocabulary achievement. The formulation of the research problems are: 1) How is the student’s vocabulary achievement taught before <b>using</b> <b>grouping</b> and organizing vocabulary? 2) How is the student’s vocabulary achievement taught after <b>using</b> <b>grouping</b> and organizing vocabulary? 3) Are there any significant different scores taught before and after <b>using</b> <b>grouping</b> and organizing vocabulary? The objectives of this study are: 1) To know the student’s vocabulary achievement taught before <b>using</b> <b>grouping</b> and organizing vocabulary, 2) To know the student’s vocabulary achievement taught after <b>using</b> <b>grouping</b> and organizing vocabulary, 3) To know whether there are any significant different scores taught before and after <b>using</b> <b>grouping</b> and organizing vocabulary. The research design of this study is experimental design with quantitative approach. The population of this study was the fifth grade students of SDN I Wonorejo Sumbergempol Tulungagung. The sample is used population sampling, the fifth grade students of SDN I Wonorejo Sumbergempol that consist 44 as population sampling. The data analysis is done by using T-test. 	The result shows that the mean of student’s score in teaching vocabulary before taught <b>using</b> <b>grouping</b> and organizing vocabulary is 75, 89. While the mean of student’s score in teaching vocabulary after <b>using</b> <b>grouping</b> and organizing vocabulary is 86, 39. The Tcount was 4, 16, whereas Ttable with significant level 5...|$|R

Group III-V semiconductors can also <b>use</b> <b>group</b> IV atoms as either donors or acceptors. When a group IV atom replaces the group III {{element in the}} semiconductor lattice, the group IV atom acts as a donor. Conversely, when a group IV atom replaces the group V element, the group IV atom acts as an acceptor. Group IV atoms can act as both donors and acceptors; therefore, they are known as amphoteric impurities.|$|E
