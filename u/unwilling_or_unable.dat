Headley, throughout Brown's term. Over time, the rift deepened and spread to the entire Democratic party. Brown also frequently clashed with the legislature and vetoed several of the bills it passed; none of his vetoes were ever overridden.|$|E

However the council rejected planning permission for the club to construct a supermarket, and the Bhattis were <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> to provide further funding for the club. Wolves won promotion out of the Second Division in 1982–83, but were relegated out of the First Division in last place in 1983–84, and Dougan sacked Hawkins and replaced him with Tommy Docherty.

5|$|Continuing {{upstream}} from Casper, the North Platte bends to the south.

The river was easier to ford here for those who were <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> to pay to cross at one of the ferries downstream. This was the last good camp spot before leaving the river and entering the waterless stretch between the North Platte and the Sweetwater River. From here the settlers entered a difficult portion called Rock Avenue which moved from spring to spring across mostly alkaline soil and steep hills until it reached the Sweetwater River. Later settlers who had crossed to the northern side of the river at Casper would come to favor a route through a small valley called Emigrant Gap which headed directly to Rock Avenue, bypassing Red Buttes.|$|E
5|$|Dewhurst {{occasionally}} captained Trinidad in the Inter-Colonial Tournament and was {{a candidate}} to captain the West Indies cricket team in England in 1928, when the two most likely men were <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> to lead the team.

Dewhurst was also overlooked as vice-captain in favour of Vibart Wight although the latter had no captaincy experience. Dewhurst was named in the team to tour England, but he withdrew. Some newspaper reports blamed illness for his decision, others suggested business reasons. Critics believed that Dewhurst's absence adversely affected the team; the replacement wicket-keepers were not regarded as equal to Dewhurst's ability, and the vice-captain had little success. It was suggested that Dewhurst only missed the tour because {{he had not been}} chosen as vice-captain.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E

30|$|Both the {{financial}} gains to pastoralists after privatisation and {{the pattern of}} generous payments to pastoralists during the land tenure reform process point to an underlying power dynamic that {{is very different from}} that suggested by the encroachment narrative. Encroachment implies that the state is more powerful and is readily willing to exercise that power over the subservient pastoralists. However, it is not so in New Zealand where pastoralists use skillful bargaining to their financial advantage. Further, the Crown’s consistent under-valuing of the development options it is selling suggests that it is pathologically <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> politically <b>unable</b> to exercise its power on its side of the land reform negotiation table. Thus, New Zealand pastoral land reform indeed appears to debunk the encroachment narrative.|$|R

In 1938, the Anschluss brought the Third Reich to the borders of Yugoslavia, and early elections were held in December.

Believing that Wilson and his advisers would not voluntarily transfer power to the vice president, a group of Congressional leaders initiated Marshall's requested joint resolution. The senators opposed to the League of Nations treaty, however, believed that as president Marshall would make several key concessions that would allow the treaty to win ratification. Wilson, in his present condition, was either <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> to make the concessions, and debate on the bill had resulted in a deadlock.

The cases all involve a situation where a third country national mother is the primary and actual carer of a minor Union citizen. Moreover, each mother has (sole) parental authority and custody over the child. The fathers in these cases, from whom the minor Union citizens derive their Dutch nationality, are either not involved at all, or only to a very minor extent and have either no or only shared parental authority. Moreover, the fathers are <b>unwilling</b> and/ <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> to take over the care for the child. Nonetheless, the mother is faced with denial of any residence rights by the Dutch authorities and will therefore be under a legal obligation to leave the Netherlands and the European Union as a whole...|$|R

Funding for this work was received from the British Overseas Development Administration, and is acknowledged with gratitude. Abstract: A fundamental macroeconomic problem in Zimbabwe is that the sum of public-sector projects is greater than the resources available to finance them. The government’s difficulty in discerning the macroeconomic limitations on new initiatives was greatly increased by the unusual circumstances of the first two years: a commodity boom; promises of more aid than eventually arrived; expectations of a peace dividend which did not come; initial high rates of economic growth; and initial low foreign debt. All of these circumstances created unrealistic expectations, concealing the probability that the government’s plans would be impossible to finance. The government was slow to react to expectations being disappointed. This created a debt problem. Drought and terms of trade shocks make things worse. No allowance is made for the likelihood of these shocks. The government is <b>unwilling</b> (<b>or</b> politically <b>unable)</b> to engage in fiscal adjustment, so the burden of adjustment is pushed on to the monetary authorities.

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMKenya’s December 2007 Presidential {{elections}} {{sparked a}} wave of violent clashes over allegations of election rigging. The protests broke out along ethnic lines, causing greater civil unrest. There have been allegations that during these outbreaks of violence crimes against humanity were committed. This violence attracted world-wide concern and was universally condemned. Kenya is loathe to prosecute the perpetrators or those who bear the highest responsibility for the alleged commission of crimes against humanity. It has instead established a national investigatory mechanism, the Kenyan Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (hereafter TJRC). This approach adopted by Kenya {{has been criticized for}} the fact that it fosters a culture of impunity. However, the Prosecutor of International Criminal Court (hereafter ICC) has used his proprio motu powers to initiate an investigation of alleged commission of crimes that fall within the jurisdiction of the Court. This research paper has analysed the reasons for the proprio motu intervention of the ICC in Kenyan situation. It also examined whether Kenya was <b>unwilling</b> <b>or</b> genuinely <b>unable</b> to prosecute the perpetrators of the post-election violence of 2007. Furthermore, the paper evaluated the provisions of the Kenyan TJRC, the major shortcomings of the Commission and the challenges it is facing in fulfilling its mandate. In conclusion the paper analysed the relationship between TJRC and ICC and re-evaluate any role that the two bodies could play in dispensing justice in Kenya. But before that, the paper laid down the factual background that led to the proprio motu interevention of the ICC in Kenya where a truth commission had alreday been established. South Afric...|$|R

60|$|The mode of {{composing}} a Senate {{which has}} been here advocated not only seems the best in itself, but is that for which historical precedent and actual brilliant success can to the greatest extent be pleaded. It is not however the only feasible plan that might be proposed. Another possible mode of forming a Second Chamber {{would be to have}} it elected by the First; subject to the restriction that they should not nominate any of their own members. Such an assembly, emanating, like the American Senate, from popular choice only once removed, would not be considered to clash with democratic institutions, and would probably acquire considerable popular influence. From the mode of its nomination, it would be peculiarly unlikely to excite the jealousy of, or to come into hostile collision with the popular House. It would, moreover (due provision being made for the representation of the minority), be almost sure to be well composed, and to comprise many of that class of highly capable men who, either from accident or for want of showy qualities, had been <b>unwilling</b> to seek, <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> to obtain, the suffrages of a popular constituency.|$|R

All of these circumstances created unrealistic expectations, concealing the probability that the government’s plans would be impossible to finance.

No allowance is made for the likelihood of these shocks. The government is <b>unwilling</b> (<b>or</b> politically <b>unable)</b> to engage in fiscal adjustment, so the burden of adjustment is pushed on to the monetary authorities. Forced saving by the private sector enables greater domestic borrowing by the government, but this reduces private consumption. Uncertainty caused by the growing public-sector debt reduces private investment. The result is a further reduction in the growth rate. A macroeconomic model shows that the variable with greatest influence on overall growth is agricultural output. However, the budget deficit has an unambiguously negative impact on exports. It also reduces private welfare and worsens the distribution of income between high- and low-income earners by reducing private consumption and investment and therefore employment. In other words, some of the policies implemented after independence and aimed at redistributing resources or alleviating poverty have been unsuccessful, or have perverse effects, creating distortions which push the economy towards macroeconomic instability. In Zimbabwe the growth of government has become a drain on the economy, rather than a facilitator of economic growth and development. ...|$|R
40|$|Research had two aims: firstly, {{to explore}} the {{clinical}} observation that dependent drug users are often apparently <b>unwilling,</b> <b>or</b> are <b>unable</b> to reflect in any depth on experience, including thinking about mental states in self and other. Secondly, to consider the intrapsychic elements that exist alongside, and which may motivate drug addiction (including heavy and dependent alcohol use). 34 drug users were interviewed using the Adult Attachment Interview, and interviews coded for Reflective Function (RF), an objective measure of the capacity to mentalize. Low RF was identified across the sample. Data from Adult Attachment Interviews also revealed that a climate of violence and/or cruelty, deprivation {{and a lack of}} basic care nearly always precede chronic drug or alcohol addiction. I suggest {{that as a result of}} this the individuals interviewed had minimised thinking about their own & others’ states of mind. Ten of the sample were then interviewed twice more using a research interview based on the clinical psychotherapeutic interview, which explored internal dynamics and object relational aspects of participants’ narratives. The data obtained revealed the presence of two kinds of internal object relating in a very specific way. A cruel, bullying, depriving object was found to dominate, and to severely restrict access to, a much weaker, though potentially helpful internal object. There was an over-reliance on the dominant bad object which was felt at one time to have saved the addict from unbearable psychic pain, but had then demanded he turn forever away from human help, denying the need for this or indeed any vulnerability or ‘weakness’. Whilst intoxication was initially found both to help the addict sustain this position, and to obliterate psychic pain, ongoing addiction actually cemented the dynamic described, and further inhibited access to helpful, human objects.
