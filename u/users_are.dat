Sixty-three percent of Twitter <b>users</b> <b>are</b> under thirty-five years old; sixty percent of Twitter <b>users</b> <b>are</b> Caucasian, but a higher than average (compared to other Internet properties) are African American/black (sixteen percent) and Hispanic (eleven percent); fifty-eight percent of Twitter users have a total {{household}} income of at least US$60,000.

5|$|Product {{activation}} {{was introduced}} in this release. After installation, <b>users</b> <b>are</b> allowed a 15-day grace period to activate their copy of Norton Internet Security 2004. The program will not work after the deadline without the 24-character product key. The product key used to activate a copy of Norton Internet Security ties in with an alphanumeric code based on a computer's hardware configuration. Users may activate their product five times with the same product key, however licensing terms dictate <b>users</b> <b>are</b> allowed only to install Norton Internet Security 2004 on one computer.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} North American auto market, by 2007 Canada had {{available}} 51 {{models of}} E85 flex-vehicles, most from Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, including automobiles, pickup trucks, and SUVs. The country had around 1.6million capable flex fuel E85s on the roads by 2014. However, most <b>users</b> <b>are</b> not aware they own an E85, as vehicles are not clearly labeled as such, {{and even though the}} newer models have a yellow cap in the fuel tank informing that the vehicle can handle E85, most <b>users</b> <b>are</b> still not aware because there are hardly any gas stations offering E85. Another major restriction for greater E85 fuel use is the fact that by June 2008 Canada had only three public E85 pumps, all located in Ontario, in the cities of Guelph, Chatham, and Woodstock. E85 fueling is available primarily for fleet vehicles, including 20 government refueling stations not available for the public. The main feedstocks for E85 production in Canada are corn and wheat, and there were several proposals being discussed to increase the actual use of E85 fuel in FFVs, such as creating an ethanol-friendly highway or ethanol corridor.|$|E

The average accuracy rate of the detectors built for 11 adult (18 to 55 years old) <b>users</b> <b>is</b> 99.07 % and for 22 senior (56 years old and up) <b>users</b> <b>is</b> 97.81 %, while {{in the case}} of detecting altered synthetic ECG signal, the average detection accuracy rate for the detectors built for 21 male <b>users</b> <b>is</b> 99.05 % and for 12 female <b>users</b> <b>is</b> 98.07 %. Lastly, the average accuracy rate of the detectors built for 11 adult (18 to 55 years old) <b>users</b> <b>is</b> 100.00 % and for 22 senior (56 years old and up) <b>users</b> <b>is</b> 98.04 %. These results indicate that our classifiers perform well for a variety of user characteristics when a <b>user’s</b> ECG <b>is</b> replaced with the synthetic ECG generated from the parameters of the users themselves.|$|R

5|$|BackupHDDVD {{represented}} {{the first known}} successful attack against AACS. The utility circumvents content protection by decrypting video files directly with AES, the underling cryptographic cipher used by AACS. Using this technique, BackupHDDVD is able to completely bypass the AACS chain of trust, rendering it immune to revocation. The cost of this immunity is that <b>users</b> <b>are</b> forced to rely on keys leaking from commercial player software to use BackupHDDVD with new discs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Users</b> <b>are</b> {{no longer}} able to {{synchronize}} Start menu layouts across all devices associated with a Microsoft account. A Microsoft developer justified the change by explaining that a user may have different applications they want to emphasize on each device that they use, rather than use the same configuration across each device. The ability to automatically install a Windows Store app across all devices associated with an account was also removed.|$|E

5|$|As {{the park}} is a {{national}} nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, all dog owners are required to keep their dogs under control while in the park. This includes not allowing their dog to disturb other park users or disrupt wildlife. In 2009, after some incidents leading {{to the death of}} wildfowl, the park's dogs-on-leads policy was extended. Park <b>users</b> <b>are</b> said to believe that the deer are feeling increasingly threatened by the growing number of dogs using the park and Royal Parks advises against walking dogs in the park during the deer's birthing season.|$|E
5|$|Norton Internet Security version 1.0 for Mac was {{released}} November 1, 2000. It can identify and remove both Windows and Mac viruses. Other features include a firewall, advertisement blocking in the browser, parental controls, {{and the ability}} to prevent confidential information from being transmitted outside the computer. <b>Users</b> <b>are</b> prompted before such information is able to be transmitted. The incorporation of Aladdin Systems' iClean allows users to purge the browser cache, cookies, and browsing history within Norton's interface. Operating system requirements call for Mac OS 8.1. Hardware requirements call for 24 MB of RAM, 12 MB of disk space, and a PowerPC processor.|$|E
5|$|Significant change {{occurred}} when the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894. The tidal section of the river below Frodsham now flowed into the ship canal, rather than the River Mersey, and the exit lock from Weston Docks also joined the canal rather than the estuary. A new ship lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which provided a more convenient route to the ship canal than the alternative route through Weston Point docks. The Weston Canal has been little used since. Although {{it is possible for}} pleasure craft to reach the Weaver from the Ship Canal, it is a commercial waterway, and most leisure <b>users</b> <b>are</b> dissuaded from doing so by the amount of paperwork and the requirements of the operating company.|$|E

5|$|Summertime {{and holiday}} queues at the Ivanja Reka {{mainline}} toll plaza can be considerable, a problem exacerbated during the usual weekend-to-weekend tourist stays at Croatia's coastal resorts. In such conditions, motorway <b>users</b> <b>are</b> advised {{to use the}} Rugvica and Ivanić Grad exits ahead of the Ivanja Reka interchange to avoid the queues. As of October 2010, the westbound transit traffic approaching the Ivanja Reka interchange must exit the tolled motorway network, since the existing Zagreb bypass is not tolled, and then re-enter another tolled motorway. There are plans for the outer Zagreb bypass to {{be integrated into the}} tolled motorway network as the ultimate solution for congestion at the Ivanja Reka toll plaza. That will require reconstruction of the Ivanić Grad interchange east of the Ivanja Reka toll plaza.|$|E

5|$|The Central Valley Project (CVP) is {{a federal}} water {{management}} project in the U.S. state of California {{under the supervision of}} the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). It was devised in 1933 in order to provide irrigation and municipal water to much of California's Central Valley—by regulating and storing water in reservoirs in the water-rich northern half of the state, and transporting it to the water-poor San Joaquin Valley and its surroundings by means of a series of canals, aqueducts and pump plants, some shared with the California State Water Project (SWP). Many CVP water <b>users</b> <b>are</b> represented by the Central Valley Project Water Association.|$|E

To address the fact that iPhone <b>users</b> <b>are</b> reluctant to switch to Android because the OS is not compatible with iTunes, from June 2012 Samsung offered customers of its Galaxy series the Easy Phone Sync app to enable the transfer of music, photos, videos, podcasts, and text messages from an iPhone to a Galaxy device.
