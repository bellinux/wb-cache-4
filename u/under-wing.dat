5|$|Su-25SM weapon suite {{has been}} {{expanded}} {{with the addition}} of the Vympel R-73 highly agile air-to-air missile (albeit without helmet mounted cuing and only the traditional longitudinal seeker mode) and the S-13T 130mm rockets (carried in five-round B-13 pods) with blast-fragmentation and armour-piercing warheads. Further, the Kh-25ML and Kh-29L Weapon Employment Profiles have been significantly improved, permitting some complex missile launch scenarios to be executed, such as: firing two consecutive missiles on two different targets in a single attack pass. The GSh-30-2 cannon (250-round magazine) has received three new reduced rate-of-fire modes: 750, 375 and 188 Rounds per Minute. The Su-25SM was also given new BD3-25 <b>under-wing</b> pylons.|$|E
5|$|The Jaguar International had {{the unusual}} {{optional}} provision for overwing pylons, used for short-range air-to-air missiles, {{such as the}} Matra R550 Magic or the AIM-9 Sidewinder. This option frees up the <b>under-wing</b> pylons for other weapons and stores. RAF Jaguars gained overwing pylons in the buildup to Operation Granby in 1990, but French Jaguars were not modified. The RAF's Jaguar 97s were intended to be wired for the carriage of ASRAAMs on the overwing launchers, but clearance of this weapon was never completed because of funding cuts.|$|E
5|$|The two 37mm (1.46in) Bordkanone BK 3,7 cannons were {{mounted in}} <b>under-wing</b> gun pods, each loaded with two six-round {{magazines}} of armour-piercing tungsten carbide-cored ammunition. With these weapons, the Kanonenvogel ("cannon-bird"), {{as it was}} nicknamed, proved very successful {{in the hands of}} Stuka aces such as Rudel. The G-1 was converted from older D-series airframes, retaining the smaller wing, but without the dive brakes. The G-2 was similar to the G-1 except for use of the extended wing of the D-5. 208 G-2s were built and at least a further 22 more were converted from D-3 airframes.|$|E
5000|$|Juveniles have pale tips {{to all of}} the greater-coverts (secondary and primary) on {{both the}} upper- and <b>under-wings,</b> forming a long narrow pale line; adults have pale fringes to upperwing secondary-coverts only.|$|R

50|$|The Bermuda petrel (Pterodroma cahow) is a gadfly petrel. Commonly {{known in}} Bermuda as the cahow, a name derived from its eerie cries, this nocturnal ground-nesting seabird is the {{national}} bird of Bermuda {{and can be found}} on Bermudian money. It is the second rarest seabird on the planet and a symbol of hope for nature conservation. They are known for their medium-sized body and long wings. The Bermuda petrel has a greyish-black crown and collar, dark grey upper-wings and tail, white upper-tail coverts and white <b>under-wings</b> edged with black, and the underparts are completely white.|$|R
5|$|Young birds {{leaving the}} nest have {{juvenile}} plumage {{in their first}} year of life. Juveniles have a dark green head and neck, upperparts and underparts. The feathers all have dark brown bases. The wings are predominantly dark brown and black with a blue sheen. The wings and tail are shorter than those of adult birds. The bill may have a buff sheen. They have an <b>under-wing</b> stripe, which is not present in the adults. Moulting generally takes place between January and April for birds of all ages. Juvenile birds then adopt immature plumage, which is similar but with patches of yellow feathers on the underparts of adult plumage as well as some adult-coloured wing feathers. Some green juvenile feathers remain until the bird is in its second year of age, though are very worn by this time.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{days later}} Braham {{returned}} to Denmark. On this occasion a No. 305 Squadron RAF Mosquito was {{borrowed from the}} Polish. On the mission he encountered a He 111 near Esjberg. It was circling a lighthouse at 300 feet. Braham fired a three-second fusillade of fire. The He 111 caught fire and nose-dived into the sea, exploding on impact. A Focke-Wulf Fw 58 trainer followed as his second victory on this mission. Meanwhile, the Germans had tracked the Mosquito by radar. Two Messerschmitt Bf 109s {{appeared on the scene}} soon afterwards. The cloud base was only at 1,000 feet and he effected his escape by hiding in its folds. One of the Bf 109s fired some ineffectual bursts of fire at Braham and he also encountered some light ground fire. He few directly to Group HQ at Benson. He returned the Mosquito the following day. Some days later, Braham returned to 305 to pick up a Mosquito and joined No. 107 Squadron RAF in a raid against Paris even though he had no formal bomber pilot training. Nine days later near Poitiers, Braham was engaged in a ground attack mission. He spotted a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 carrying a drop tank and <b>under-wing</b> rockets at low-level. He fired at 600 yards as the enemy accelerated to escape. His fire slowed the Fw 190; catching up with it, the Fw 190 was hit again and crashed: its wreckage strewn over three fields. The Focke-Wulf was his 27th victory.|$|E

5000|$|Aerodramus swiftlets are in {{many respects}} typical swifts, having narrow wings for fast flight, and a wide gape and small reduced beak {{surrounded}} by bristles for catching insects in flight. They have dull plumage which is mainly in shades of black, brown, and grey. Members of this genus typically have dark brown upper wings and upper body, sometimes with a paler rump, light brown underparts, a paler throat, and brownish-white <b>under-wings</b> with dark brown [...] "armpits". Males and female plumages are similar in appearance, as {{is that of the}} juvenile, for those species for which it has been described; in some species the juvenile shows pale fringes to the flight feathers.|$|R
50|$|The adult African river {{martin is}} a large swallow, 14 cm long. It is mainly black, with a silky blue-green gloss to the head, {{becoming}} distinctly green {{on the back and}} wing coverts. The underparts, other than the brownish <b>under-wings,</b> are purple-black, and the flight feathers are black. The black square tail is 4.8 cm long, and the soft feather shafts project beyond the barbed section. This feature is most pronounced in the two central feathers, which in the related white-eyed river martin are greatly elongated. The African river martin has brown legs with a 1.5 cm long tarsus, red eyes, pink eye-rings, and a broad orange-red bill. The wing length averages 14 cm.|$|R
50|$|The African river martin (Pseudochelidon eurystomina) is a {{passerine}} bird, one of {{two members}} of the river martin subfamily of the swallow family, Hirundinidae. When discovered, it was not initially recognised as a swallow, and its structural differences from most of its relatives, including its stout bill and robust legs and feet, have led to its current placement in a separate subfamily shared only with the Asian white-eyed river martin. The African river martin is a large swallow, mainly black with a blue-green gloss to the head and a greener tint to the back and wings. The <b>under-wings</b> are brownish, the underparts are purple-black, and the flight feathers are black. This martin has red eyes, a broad orange-red bill and a black, square tail. Young birds are similar in appearance to the adults, but have browner plumage. This species has a variety of unmusical calls, and displays both in flight and on the ground, although the purpose of the terrestrial display is unknown.|$|R
25|$|Various munitions {{could be}} {{mounted on the}} one {{centerline}} and four <b>under-wing</b> hardpoints, including bombs, missiles and rockets; payloads of up to 2,000 lb may be carried upon the centerline and the two innermost <b>under-wing</b> pylons, while the outer pylons can carry up to 1,000 lb. All four of the <b>under-wing</b> hardpoints are plumbed for drop tanks to extend the aircraft's range, Italian aircraft are also fitted with a fixed aerial refueling probe. Optical reconnaissance pods can be carried externally on the centerline hardpoint. Wingtip rails are provided for infrared guided air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder and MAA-1 Piranha. Italian aircraft are fitted with a M61 Vulcan 20mm rotary cannon {{on the port side}} of the lower fuselage. The United States denied the sale of the M61 to Brazil, thus its AMXs are instead fitted with two 30mm DEFA 554 revolver cannons.|$|E

6000|$|One night a moth fluttered in and alighted {{on my hand}} as I sat by the fire, causing me to hold {{my breath}} as I gazed on it. Its fore-wings were pale grey, with shadings dark and light written all over in finest {{characters}} with some twilight mystery or legend; but the round <b>under-wings</b> were clear amber-yellow, veined like a leaf with red and purple veins; a thing of such exquisite chaste beauty that {{the sight of it}} gave me a sudden shock of pleasure. Very soon it flew up, circling about, and finally lighted on the palm-leaf thatch directly over the fire. The heat, I thought, would soon drive it from the spot; and, rising, I opened the door, so that it might find its way out again into its own cool, dark, flowery world. And standing by the open door I turned and addressed it: [...] "O night-wanderer of the pale, beautiful wings, go forth, and should you by chance meet her somewhere in the shadowy depths, revisiting her old haunts, be my messenger--" [...] Thus much had I spoken when the frail thing loosened its hold to fall without a flutter, straight and swift, into the white blaze beneath. I sprang forward with a shriek and stood staring into the fire, my whole frame trembling with a sudden terrible emotion. Even thus had Rima fallen--fallen from the great height--into the flames that instantly consumed her beautiful flesh and bright spirit! O cruel Nature! ...|$|R
6000|$|Turning now to Moths: most {{of these}} rest {{motionless}} with their wings depressed during the whole or greater part of the day; and the upper surfaces of their wings are often shaded and coloured in an admirable manner, as Mr. Wallace has remarked, for escaping detection. With most of the Bombycidæ and Noctuidæ,[508] when at rest, the front-wings overlap and conceal the hind-wings; so that the latter might be brightly coloured without much risk; and they are thus coloured in many species of both families. During the act of flight, moths would often be able to escape from their enemies; nevertheless, as the hind-wings are then fully exposed to view, their bright colours must generally have been acquired {{at the cost of}} some little risk. But the following fact shews us how cautious we ought to be in drawing conclusions on this head. The common yellow <b>under-wings</b> (Triphaena) often fly about during the day or early evening, and are then conspicuous from the colour of their hind-wings. It would naturally be thought {{that this would be a}} source of danger; but Mr. J. Jenner Weir believes that it actually serves them as a means of escape, for birds strike at these brightly coloured and fragile surfaces, instead of at the body. For instance, Mr. Weir turned into his aviary a vigorous specimen of Triphaena pronuba, which was instantly pursued by a robin; but the bird’s attention being caught by the coloured wings, the moth was not captured until after about fifty attempts, and small portions of the wings were repeatedly broken off. He tried the same experiment, in the open air, with a T. fimbria and swallow; but the large size of this moth probably interfered with its capture.[509] We are thus reminded of a statement made by Mr. Wallace,[510] namely, that in the Brazilian forests and Malayan islands, many common and highly-decorated butterflies are weak flyers, though furnished with a broad expanse of wings; and they “are often captured with pierced and broken wings, as if they had been seized by birds, from which they had escaped: if the wings had been much smaller in proportion to the body, it seems probable that the insect would more frequently have been struck or pierced in a vital part, and thus the increased expanse of the wings may have been indirectly beneficial.” ...|$|R

25|$|Some {{versions}} of the G-6 and later Gs had a taller, wood-structure tail unit and redesigned rudder which improved stability at high speeds. The introduction of the WGr. 21cm (8in) <b>under-wing</b> mortar/rockets and the 30mm (1.18in) MK 108 cannon increased firepower. Certain production batches of the Bf 109G were fitted with aileron Flettner tabs to decrease stick forces at high speeds. A radio-navigational method, the Y-Verführung (Y-Guidance) was introduced with the FuG 16ZY.|$|E

25|$|The Hawk is {{designed}} to carry a centreline gun pod, such as the 30mm ADEN cannon, two <b>under-wing</b> pylons, and up to four hardpoints for fitting armaments and equipment. In RAF service, Hawks have been equipped to operate the Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In the early 1990s, British Aerospace investigated the possibility of arming the Hawk with the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile for export customers. In 2016, BAE Systems was developing so-called 'Advanced Hawk' with a new wing using leading-edge slats, and potentially additional sensors and weapons, a head-mounted display, and a single large-screen display in the forward cockpit.|$|E

It was later found that an engine seal had failed, causing catastrophic engine failure and slight damage to the engine cowling and <b>under-wing</b> surface. The subsequent investigation uncovered design and manufacturing defects with the seals and led to the incorporation of new design seals in all future engines.|$|E
25|$|In {{place of}} {{internal}} wing armament, additional firepower was provided through {{a pair of}} 20mm MG 151/20 cannons installed in conformal gun pods under the wings. The conformal gun pods, exclusive of ammunition, weighed 135kg (298lb); and 135 to 145 rounds were provided per gun. The total weight, including ammunition, was 215kg. Installation of the <b>under-wing</b> gun pods was a simple task that could be quickly performed by the unit's armourers, and the gun pods imposed a reduction of speed of only 8km/h (5mph). By comparison, the installed weight of a similar armament of two 20mm MG 151/20 cannon inside {{the wings of the}} FW 190A-4/U8 was 130kg (287lb), without ammunition.|$|E
25|$|As a {{means of}} combating the massed {{firepower}} of bomber streams, JG 11 personnel trialed the viability of bombing the formations from above with 250kg bombs, a practice pioneered by Luftwaffe Oberleutnant Heinz Knoke in March 1943.

However the loss in performance of the bomb-laden Bf 109's, along with their vulnerability to escorting fighters, soon curtailed the practice. 5./JG 11 were {{at the forefront of}} tactical developments for effectively intercepting the day bomber formations. The most effective tactic were mass frontal assaults, while other methods trialed were the use of Werfer-Granate (Wfr. Gr. or WGr) 21 <b>under-wing</b> rockets.

These gun pods were fitted to a Ju 87 D-1, W.Nr 2552. The first flight of the machine took place on 31 January 1943, piloted by Hauptmann Hans-Karl Stepp. The continuing problems with about two dozens of the Ju 88P-1, and slow development of the Henschel Hs 129B-3, each of them equipped with a large, PaK 40-based, autoloading Bordkanone 7,5 7.5cm (2.95in) cannon in a conformal gun pod beneath the fuselage, meant the Ju 87G was put into production. In April 1943, the first production Ju 87 G-1s were delivered to front line units.|$|E
500|$|By 1978, {{development}} studies {{focused on}} two variants: a [...] with seating for 160, and a [...] with room for over 180 seats. New features included a redesigned wing, <b>under-wing</b> engines, and lighter materials, while the forward fuselage, cockpit layout, and T-tail configuration were retained from the 727. Boeing {{planned for the}} aircraft to offer the lowest fuel burn per passenger-kilometer of any narrow-body airliner. On August 31, 1978, Eastern Air Lines and British Airways became the first carriers to publicly commit to the 7N7 when they announced launch orders totaling 40 aircraft for the [...] version.
