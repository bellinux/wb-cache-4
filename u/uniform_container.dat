40|$|The {{paper is}} {{historical}} in two respects, both concerned with visual representations of past time. Its first {{purpose is to}} enquire how visual representations of historical time {{can be used to}} bring out patterns in a museum collection. A case study is presented of the visualisation of data with sufficient subtlety to be useful to historians and curators. Such a visual analytics approach raises questions about the proper representation of time and of objects and events within it. It is argued that such chronographics can support both an externalised, objectivising point of view from ‘outside ’ time and one which is immersive and gives a sense of the historic moment. These modes are set in their own historical context through original historical research, highlighting the shift to an Enlightenment view of time as a <b>uniform</b> <b>container</b> for events. This in turn prompts new ways of thinking about chronological visualisation, in particular the separation of the ‘ideal ’ image of time from contingent, temporary rendered views...|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of Spencer Street {{bridge over the}} Yarra River in 1929 reduced {{the capacity of the}} river wharves, and led to expansion downstream of port facilities initially with Appleton Dock. Swanson Dock was constructed in 1968 on the former Coode Island as Melbourne's first all-container shipping terminal, reflecting the rapid world-wide change {{at the beginning of the}} 1960s, from unit cargo where each product was loaded in different forms of packaging, to shipping cargo in <b>uniform</b> sized <b>containers.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} demurrage policies and charges of selected shipping companies and terminal operators in the Lagos ports {{and the implications}} {{in the economy and}} shipping industry in Nigeria. It adopted the survey approach to gather data from the dominant container operators (carriers) and the terminal operators. Demurrage duration and categorization of the demurrage periods and charges for each period by the selected operators were collected and compared using the statistical tool of analysis of variance to determine if there are differences among the charges and charging systems. It was found that, significant differences do not exist in the average rate of demurrage charges per container per day among the shipping companies and terminal operators in Lagos seaports. The study also found that there is {{no significant difference in the}} average amount charged as demurrage among the shipping companies and terminal operators in the three differing periods of demurrage duration in Lagos ports, Nigeria. It was recommended among other things that, the Nigerian shippers’ council as the governmental body responsible for freight regulation and protection of shippers 2 ̆ 7 interest should by policy fix a <b>uniform</b> <b>container</b> demurrage rate for all terminal operators and carriers operating in Nigeria...|$|E
50|$|Lego used mainly {{injection}} molding machines from the brands Arburg(Germany) and Engel (Austria), but also machines from Battenfeld (Austria) and Klöckner-Werke (Germany). Only up to 6 two-component machines {{were used in}} the Lättich plant. Most of the accessories used for extraction, heating control and post-processing were developed and built by Lego itself. In the case of the cooling water appliances, Lego used only HB-Therm temperature control units. For the storage of the Legosbriks, cardboard boxes were used initially, later <b>uniform</b> plastic <b>containers</b> of different sizes were used. Although all these plastic containers were intended exclusively for internal use in the Lego Group, they were not produced by Lego, but from an external manufacturer only for lego.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} container ships {{after the}} Second World War {{were converted to}} tankers, built up from surplus T2 tankers after World War II. In 1951, the first purpose-built container vessels began operating in Denmark, and between Seattle and Alaska. The first commercially successful container ship was , a T2 tanker, owned by Malcom McLean, which carried 58 metal containers between Newark, New Jersey and Houston, Texas on its first voyage. In 1955, McLean built his company, McLean Trucking into one of United States' biggest freighter fleets. In 1955, he purchased the small Pan Atlantic Steamship Company from Waterman Steamship and adapted its ships to carry cargo in large <b>uniform</b> metal <b>containers.</b> [...] On April 26, 1956, {{the first of these}} rebuilt container vessels, Ideal X, left the Port Newark in New Jersey and a new revolution in modern shipping resulted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Panama Canal {{extension}} project is, arguably, {{the most}} important current transportation project in the world today. It will allow most Post-Panamax vessels to use the canal {{and is likely to}} change transportation flow patterns throughout North and South America, as well as port loads and transportation flows inland in the Americas. This paper gives a short update on the status of the project and its likely impacts. The Panama Canal Expansion Program is perhaps the most impactful transportation project today. The $ 5. 5 Billion project will enable the Canal to handle up to 12, 600 TEU, Post-Panamax vessels, instead of the current maximum of 4, 400 TEU, Panamax Vessels. The Panama Canal Expansion Program was launched in September 2007 and is scheduled for completion in 2014, 100 years after the original inauguration of the canal. Many pundits claim that the project will lead to “the biggest shift in the freight business since the 1950 s, when oceangoing ships began carrying goods in <b>uniform</b> metal <b>containers.</b> ” (Severson 2011) Halfway through the program, it is appropriate to examine the progress t...|$|R
40|$|Orchestia” scutigerula Dana (Amphipoda: Talitridae) {{was found}} beneath supralittoral stones at Kanin Point, S. Georgia. Microhabitat {{temperatures}} recorded over 6 summer weeks varied widely (hourly, diurnally, weekly), especially under stones highest upshore. In air, “O. ” scutigerula tolerated temperatures between − 2 and 19 °C. Temperatures between 19 and 28 °C were survivable only in fully saturated air. In water, {{a temperature of}} 19 °C was tolerated for 6 h. The locomotory behaviour (walking) of amphipods for 3 h underwater was the same in distilled water as seawater. After 6 h in distilled water, amphipods exhibited distress, and after 7 h most were incapable of walking. “O. ” scutigerula is a strong hyper/hypo-osmoregulator during short-term exposure {{to a wide range}} of salinities. All individuals tested survived any combination of salinity and temperature between 5 and 34 ‰ and 2 and 12 °C. Amphipods chose, (a) shaded conditions both in air or in water, (b) moist to dry gravel, and (c) moist gravel to moist sand. They did not burrow into moist sand, even though markedly thigmokinetic. In <b>uniform,</b> featureless <b>containers</b> amphipods were quiescent during the day, clumping together. At night such clumps dispersed and exploratory activity increased. Swimming was never observed, and when out of water these talitrids hopped rarely. Tussock grass and macroalgal debris dominated their gut contents in situ, with terrestrial plant debris increasing in prominence in amphipods from higher upshore. Feeding trials revealed high consumption of rotting tussock grass debris and green algae (Ulothrix, Ulva). Soft materials were consumed preferentially. Rate of passage of food through the gut was very variable, both within and between individuals. Underwater, “O. ” scutigerula fed at half the rate in air. Food preferences of individuals sometimes switched between equally available foods over time. Fecundity is linearly related to female body length. Eggs more than double in volume during development...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} paper {{describes the}} measurement of boundary conditions while cooling a metal hydride (MH) container with the La 0. 85 Ce 0. 15 Ni 5 alloy. Results are subsequently used for 3 D simulation of thermal field in the container {{during the process of}} hydrogen absorption. To solve the complicated flow of cooling medium among individual pressure receptacles, ANSYS CFX simulation tool is used and the finite volume method is applied. The same simulation tool is used to describe heat conduction in the metal alloy and the container. For the given construction of the <b>container,</b> <b>uniform</b> distribution of stored hydrogen can be expected among individual receptacles. For cooling the system, cooling radiator is used which is based on Peltier elements. The radiator also enables, in case of desorption, to warm the container. By measuring flows of working substances and the relevant temperatures, it is possible to obtain, by subsequent analysis of temperature flows, the resulting value of the internal heat source. This internal heat source creates a temperature gradient in the container, which impedes exact determination of Pressure Concentration Isotherm curves that should be ideally measured at constant temperature. In addition, measuring in combination with numerical calculations offers {{a closer look at the}} absorption process directly in the hydrogen manufacturing plant where, using the alternative energy source, hydrogen is produced and subsequently stored. The results enable to optimize the cooling process in MH hydrogen storage equipment of similar construction and indicate problems with meeting the requirements of the American Department of Energy (DOE).
