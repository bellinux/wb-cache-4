40|$|To {{analyze the}} effect of polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) 118 on fish bone metabolism, we examined osteoclastic and osteoblastic activities, as well as plasma calcium levels, in the scales of PCB (118) -injected goldfish. In addition, effect of PCB (118) on osteoclasts and osteoblasts was investigated in vitro. Immature goldfish, in which the endogenous effects of sex steroids are negligible, were <b>used.</b> <b>PCB</b> (118) was solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 10 ppm. At 1 and 2 days after PCB (118) injection (100 ng/g body weight), both osteoclastic and osteoblastic activities, and plasma calcium levels were measured. In an in vitro study, then, both osteoclastic and osteoblastic activities as well as each marker mRNA expression were examined. At 2 days, scale osteoclastic activity in PCB (118) -injected goldfish increased significantly, while osteoblastic activity did not change significantly. Corresponding to osteoclastic activity, plasma calcium levels increased significantly at 2 days after PCB (118) administration. Osteoclastic activation also occurred in the marker enzyme activities and mRNA expressions in vitro. Thus, we conclude that PCB (118) disrupts bone metabolism in goldfish both in vivo and in vitro experiments. © 2012 The Author(s) ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to provide the {{embodiment}} of sample PCB design for manufacturing and assembly rules for fine-pitch devices in a commercially PCB design application. Most commercially <b>used</b> <b>PCB</b> design applications provide for PCB design rule-checking to an extent, particularly in setting geometric constraints for laying out components on the substrate. For example, in automatic placement of connectors and components within a PCB design file. The role of the design rule checker within PCB design software is a fundamentally important in ensuring process yield in PCB fabrication as well as ensuring functional acceptance in test whilst maintaining accurate placement of components. The design rules implemented in this paper emanate from a wider programme of research that focusses on design for manufacturing and assembly issues in Surface Mount Technology (SMT), Fine-Pitch Technology (FPT) and Flat Pack Ball-Grid Array (FPBGA). This work explores the methodology of decision support {{in the design of}} electronic products with specific regard to design for manufacturing and assembly. The design for manufacturing rules used in this implementation scenario is for the precise location and placement of Fine-pitch components...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is {{generally}} {{well known that}} PCB (Printed Circuit Board) is a complex mixture of various metals mixed with various types of plastics and ceramics. Accordingly, {{it is very important}} to extract metallic components from used PCB’s from the point of view of recycling the used resources as well as the environmental protection. In this study, a high temperature pyro-metallurgical process was investigated to extract valuable metallic components from the used PCB’s. For this purpose, used PCB’s were shredded and oxidized to remove plastic materials, and then, a high frequency induction furnace was used to melt and separate metallic components in molten state from the remaining oxides. After the oxidation of the <b>used</b> <b>PCB,</b> 30. 6 wt % SiO 2, 19. 3 wt % Al 2 O 3 and 14 wt % CaO were analyzed as major oxides, and thereafter, a typical composition of 32 wt%SiO 2 - 20 wt%Al 2 O 3 - 38 wt%CaO- 10 wt%MgO was chosen as a basic slag system for the separation of metallic components Moreover, in order to understand the size effect on the extraction of metallic components, oxidized PCB’s were further milled, and then, melted. As a result, it was found that the size of oxidized PCB’s was needed to be less 0. 9 mm to make a homogeneous liquid slag and to recycle metallic components over 95 %...|$|E

This was ultimate safety that one looks for in a home security system. We can also add features such as lpg gas leakage, fire breakdowns or even water tank overflow. Chapter 2 deals with the history of home automation along a brief description of Hardware & Software. Chapter 3 deals with the basics of GSM System.

40|$|Concentrations of {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) and {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured in 13 surficial sediment samples collected at three lacustrine locations in the surroundings of Mexico City and four coastal areas of the States of Sinaloa, Sonora, Oaxaca and Veracruz. Total PCB concentrations span the interval 3. 18 – 621 ng g − 1. The highest values (63. 7 – 621 ng g − 1) were found in Mexico City, which is a highly anthropogenically impacted area, whereas low concentrations (3. 18 – 12. 9 ng g − 1) were characteristic of seven places, some of them subject to intense hydrodynamics. In these latter cases, values increase by 18 – 73 times if normalised against the fine fraction (silt plus clay) content in sediment. Two samples from Mexico City exceed the ERM (Effect Range Median) guidelines {{and are likely to}} cause adverse effects. Samples contain only lower chlorinated PCBs (mainly 2 -, 3 - and 4 -CB), thus suggesting that the most <b>used</b> <b>PCB</b> commercial mixture was Aroclor 1242. The homologue composition of the sample taken close to the nuclear power plant of Laguna Verde is identical to this commercial mixture. PAHs in the same samples have relatively low concentrations (14. 9 – 287 ng g − 1), well below ERL (Effect Range Low) guidelines.
