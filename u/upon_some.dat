5|$|Alligators {{have created}} a niche in wet prairies. With their claws and snouts they dig at low spots and create ponds free of {{vegetation}} that remain submerged throughout the dry season. Alligator holes are integral {{to the survival of}} aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, and birds during extended drought periods. The alligators then feed <b>upon</b> <b>some</b> of the animals that come to the hole.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} Dreamworld {{car park}} was redesigned to accommodate more {{cars and the}} addition of a water park in the southern portion. Construction of the water park began in January 2006. In June, two of the three slide towers were complete, with several slides in the early phases of construction. One month later, several attractions were announced by the park with others being speculated <b>upon.</b> <b>Some</b> attractions were nearing completion in September and all the planned attractions had been revealed by October.|$|E

5|$|In the finale, {{the main}} {{characters}} spend the longest {{amount of time in}} the parallel universe to date. The writers sought to emphasize {{the differences between the two}} worlds: Anna Torv created a unique personality and physical demeanor for her character's doppelgänger, Fauxlivia; DC Comics designed special covers based <b>upon</b> <b>some</b> of their classic editions to display in the Other Side. These and other popular culture differences were noted and appreciated by critics, persuading the writers to add more in the third season. The episodes mark the first appearance of recurring character Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), as well as the return of actors Leonard Nimoy and Kirk Acevedo as William Bell and Agent Charlie Francis, respectively.|$|E
5|$|While Sauropelta was an {{important}} part of the Cloverly herbivore guild, the most abundant herbivorous dinosaur of the time was the large ornithopod Tenontosaurus. The smaller ornithopod Zephyrosaurus, rare titanosaur sauropods, and an unknown type of ornithomimosaur also lived alongside Sauropelta. The dromaeosaurid theropod Deinonychus fed <b>upon</b> <b>some</b> of these herbivores, and the sheer number of Deinonychus teeth scattered throughout the formation are a testament to its abundance. Microvenator, a small basal oviraptorosaur, hunted smaller prey, while the apex predators of the Cloverly was the large allosauroid theropod Acrocanthosaurus. Lungfish, triconodont mammals, and several species of turtles lived in the Cloverly, while crocodilians prowled the rivers, lakes, and swamps, providing evidence of a year-round warm climate. The Late Jurassic fauna dominated by allosauroids, stegosaurs, and many varieties of huge sauropods gave way by Cloverly times to an Early Cretaceous fauna in which dromaeosaurs, ornithopods, and nodosaurs like Sauropelta were predominant. After the Cloverly ended, a large wave of Asian animals, including tyrannosaurids, ceratopsians, and ankylosaurids would disperse into western North America, forming the mixed fauna seen throughout the Late Cretaceous.|$|E

25|$|Attempts {{to found}} a state based <b>upon</b> <b>some</b> 3,000 {{settlers}} proved difficult.

25|$|Devon {{archaeologist}} Ralegh Radford excavated at {{the site}} from 1933 through to 1938, and he pioneered the hypothesis that Tintagel Castle had been a monastery during Period II.

25|$|There is also {{discussion}} among philosophers about mental supervenience and {{our experience of}} duration. If all mental properties supervene only <b>upon</b> <b>some</b> physical properties at durationless moments, then {{it may be difficult}} to explain our experience of duration. The philosophical belief that mental and physical events exist as a series of durationless moments that lie between the physical past and the physical future is known as presentism, and is a form of belief in Galilean relativity.|$|E
25|$|Dicraeosaurids {{are a part}} of Diplodocoidea and are {{the sister}} group to Diploidocidae. In the past two decades, the known {{diversity}} of the group has doubled. However, the classification of Suuwassea as a dicraeosaurid is not universally agreed <b>upon.</b> <b>Some</b> phylogenetic analyses have found Suuwassea to be a basal diplodocoid instead of a dicraeosaurid. One 2015 analysis has even found Dyslocosaurus and Dystrophaeus as members of Dicraeosauridae. A 2016 reappraisal of Amargatitanis has placed it into the Dicraeosauridae, as well.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{attempts}} were made to provide the DH.9 with an adequate engine; a number of aircraft were powered by the Siddeley Puma, a lightened and supposedly more powerful version of the BHP. In August 1917, an order for 2,000 Fiat A12 engines was placed, intending to be delivered between January and June 1918 and used <b>upon</b> <b>some</b> production batches of the D.H9; however, deliveries of the Fiat engine were unsatisfactory. Another alternative powerplant was adopted {{in the form of the}} 430hp (321kW) Napier Lion engine; one such Lion-engined aircraft achieved a World Altitude Record of 30,500ft (13,900m) on 2 January 1919.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} single avionics system fitted upon the Tiger is the mast-mounted Osiris sight/sensor; this incorporates optical TV and thermal cameras, a laser range finder/tracker/designator, and multiple gyroscopes for stabilisation. Osiris performs as the main sensor for target observation and acquisition, providing firing and targeting data via the weapons computer; Osiris also enables entirely passive target acquisition to be undertaken and was developed to maximise {{the capabilities of the}} Trigat anti-tank missile developed in parallel to the Tiger itself. An alternative optical system to Osiris is mounted on the aircraft's roof <b>upon</b> <b>some</b> variants.|$|E
25|$|The {{database}} draws <b>upon</b> <b>some</b> 4,300 Hebrew sources, {{from the}} classic Rabbinic literature period (2nd century BCE) through the Geonic period (11th century CE) to 1947. Literary strata and genres represented include the Dead Sea Scrolls, inscriptions, Talmud and Midrash, Geonic literature, prayer and piyyut, Karaite literature, science, deeds, colophons, amulets, and the like. Essentially a concordance, the online resource accesses {{all the words}} in the database and enables retrieval of citations according to roots, lemmata, and declined forms or combinations, as well as of specific texts by title, author, date, or literary genre. It is updated as new research becomes available and as more old texts are discovered.|$|E
25|$|If the {{flashing}} body {{is set on}} fire and rushes violently to the Earth it is called a thunderbolt; if it is only half of fire, but violent also and massive, it is called a meteor; if it is entirely free from fire, it is called a smoking bolt.

Lightning is sometimes smoky, and is then called 'smoldering lightning"; sometimes it darts quickly along, and is then said to be vivid. At other times, it travels in crooked lines, and is called forked lightning. When it swoops down <b>upon</b> <b>some</b> object it is called 'swooping lightning'.|$|E
