50|$|At {{the end of}} 1970, Prof. Alwin Diemer, Univ.of Düsseldorf {{proposed}} to Ingetraut Dahlberg to undertake a philosophical dissertation on The <b>universal</b> <b>classification</b> system of knowledge, its ontological, epistemological, and information theoretical foundations. Diemer had in mind an innovating ontological approach for such a system based on the whole spectrum of kinds of being and complying with epistemological requirements. The third requirement had already been taken up somehow in the Indian Colon Classification, yet it still called for explanations and additions. In 1974, the dissertation was published in German entitled Grundlagen universaler Wissensordnung. It started with conceptual clarifications, and why and how the term „universal“ was linked to knowledge, including knowledge fields, such as commodity science, artefacts, statistics, patents, standardization, communication, utility services et al. In chapter 3, six <b>universal</b> <b>classification</b> systems (DDC, UDC, LCC, BC, CC and BBK) were presented, analyzed and compared.|$|E

40|$|OBJETIVOS: O objetivo deste trabalho foi determinar o grau de reprodutibilidade intra e interobservador em relação às classificações de Frykman, AO e Universal para as fraturas distais do rádio. MÉTODOS: Neste estudo foram selecionadas 40 radiografias de fraturas distais do rádio que foram classificadas por ortopedistas de centros e nível de experiência diferentes, determinando-se o grau de reprodutibilidade intra e interobservador através do método estatístico Kappa. RESULTADOS: A concordância intra-observador média observada foi moderada para as classificações de Frykman e Universal e leve para o sistema AO. A reprodutibilidade média interobservador foi leve nas duas leituras para as classificações de Frykman e Universal e desprezível na segunda leitura da classificação AO. CONCLUSÃO: Todas as classificações utilizadas apresentaram reprodutibilidade interobservador questionável, comprometendo o uso dos três sistemas avaliados.

40|$|Introduction: This study {{evaluated}} the interobserver reliability of plain radiograpy versus computed tomography (CT) for the Universal and AO classification systems for distal radius fractures. Patients and methods: Five observers classified 21 sets of distal radius fractures using plain radiographs and CT independently. Kappa statistics {{were used to}} establish a relative level of agreement between observers for both readings. Results: Interobserver agreement was rated as moderate for the <b>Universal</b> <b>classification</b> and poor for the AO classification. Reducing the AO system to 9 categories and to its three main types reliability was raised to a ""moderate"" level. No difference was found for interobserver reliability between the <b>Universal</b> <b>classification</b> using plain radiographs and the <b>Universal</b> <b>classification</b> using computed tomography. Interobserver reliability of the AO classification system using plain radiographs {{was significantly higher than}} the interobserver reliability of the AO classification system using only computed tomography. Conclusion: From these data, we conclude that classification of distal radius fractures using CT scanning without plain radiographs is not beneficial...|$|E

40|$|Since channel {{characteristics}} of a practical {{code division multiple access}} (CDMA) system are usually unknown and difficult to model accurately, we focus on the design of non-parametric adaptive receivers with two general assumptions: First, we assume that one training sequence from each source is available; Second, the received continuous-valued sequences are quantized into a finite alphabet, and we assume that the quantized sequences can be modeled by discrete (interleaved) stationary Markov sources of certain finite order. We study and generalize the <b>universal</b> <b>classification</b> theory to develop both single-user and multi-user receivers for wireless CDMA communications based on these empirical observations. For the forward link (from base station to mobile station), we employ the type-based single-user receiver developed from <b>universal</b> <b>classification</b> for discrete stationary Markov sources. We describe an optimal quantizer design method for <b>universal</b> <b>classification</b> of continuous sources, and develop the type-based single-user receiver that achieves multiple access interference rejection through optimal quantization of empirical training data. Compared with detectors with the same knowledge, i. e., code and timing of the intended user only, our receiver yields smaller error probabilities in multi-user environments with non-Gaussian noise or weak Gaussian noise. We then develop the <b>universal</b> <b>classification</b> theory with multiple independent receptions from each source, and demonstrate that equal-gain combining of type-based statistics from each reception asymptotically achieves error probabilities that decay exponentially at larger rates than single-reception type-based detection. We apply this result to both diversity reception to combat multipath fading and soft-decision decoding of convolutional codes. We generalize the <b>universal</b> <b>classification</b> theory to discrete interleaved stationary Markov sources and show that error probabilities decay exponentially in the length of the test sequence asymptotically. Based on this theory, we develop the type-based multi-user receiver for the reverse link (from mobile station to base station). Given the knowledge of the codes of all users, but not the amplitudes or the channel noise model, we show that the type-based multi-user receiver yields asymptotically decaying error probability for each user. It yields reasonable performance degradation than the decorrelating detector in Gaussian noise, but achieves significant performance gain in non-Gaussian noise...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-A new {{notion of}} {{empirical}} informational divergence (relative entropy) between two individual sequences is introduced. If the two sequences are independent realizations of two finiteorder, finite alphabet, stationary Markov processes, the empirical relative entropy converges {{to the relative}} entropy almost surely. This new empirical divergence {{is based on a}} version of the Lempel-Ziv data compression algorithm. A simple <b>universal</b> <b>classification</b> algorithm for individual sequences into a finite number of classes which is based on the empirical divergence, is introduced. It discriminates between the classes whenever they are distinguishable by some finite-memory classifier, for almost every given training sets and almost any test sequence from these classes. It is universal in the sense of being independent of the unknown sources.

Using the adiabatic hyperspherical representation, we discuss a <b>universal</b> <b>classification</b> of three-body systems in terms of the attractive or repulsive character of the effective interactions.

This paper presents the results on high-end structure and classification, being the base for an improved long-term documentation and providing advanced computational views. Content and application context cover factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge. The core elements are multi-disciplinary knowledge objects, which carry attributes allowing for the creation of various dimensions inside the knowledge resources. The attributes are accompanied by references to flexible multi-lingual <b>universal</b> <b>classifications.</b> The discussion presents the fundamental results having contributed to the knowledge resources. The organisational structure of the knowledge resources supports Big Data integration by a sustainable knowledge definition. The outcome are multi-disciplinary knowledge bases linked with any context, which have led to generate knowledge matrices and which can be used to create computational views. The case studies implemented content and structure as well as workflows for creating knowledge matrices. The implementation deploys dynamical, interactive, and batch computing and storage resources in an Integrated Information and Computing System environment exploiting High End Computing (HEC) and High Performance Computing (HPC) resources and references to the <b>Universal</b> Decimal <b>Classification</b> (UDC).
