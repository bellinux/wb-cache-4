Prominently, the floating-point <b>unit</b> <b>multiplier</b> was modified to take up less area by halving the tree of carry-save adders that summed the partial products of the mantissa. This simplification left the latency of single precision multiplies unchanged (two cycles), but increased the latency of double precision multiplies to three cycles. The performance loss was deemed acceptable as the PA-7100LC was designed for mid-range multimedia workstations where single-precision multiplies are more prevalent.
