25|$|In an {{interview}} with the German magazine Bunte, in 1985, Brunner described how he escaped capture by the Allies immediately after World War II. The identity of Brunner was apparently mixed <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of another SS member with the same surname, Anton Brunner, who was executed for war crimes. Alois, like Josef Mengele, did not have the SS blood type tattoo, which prevented his identity from detection in an Allied prison camp. Anton Brunner, who had worked in Vienna deporting Jews, was confused after the war with Alois due to the shared surname, including by historians such as Gerald Reitlinger.|$|E

25|$|Both the Bourne Eau and the Glen were {{affected}} by flooding, causing failure of the banks, which was addressed in the Black Sluice act of 1765. The history of navigation is intimately tied <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of the Bourne Eau, since Bourne was the main centre of population above Spalding. The Bourne Eau act of 1781 appointed trustees, who were to scour and cleanse the river, and could charge tolls to fund the operation. Corn and wool passed down the river, bound for Boston, while coal and groceries were the principal cargo in the opposite direction. In 1792, Thomas Hawkes wrote about trade in timber, which was carried from Bourne to Spalding, {{and there was a}} boat which carried passengers to the market at Spalding on Tuesdays, but he comments that the service was erratic, as there was often too little or too much water for the vessels to operate. The Black Sluice Commissioners installed flood doors between the Glen and the Bourne Eau at Tongue End, to prevent high water levels in the Glen passing up the river to Bourne.|$|E

[...] Houllier hit back at critics that had labelled Liverpool as boring before the match: [...] "Maybe we are a boring side — as I seem to keep reading — but I will put <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> We must have scored 122 of our 123 goals on the counter attack, but all I know is that our total this season is the third highest in Liverpool's history." ...|$|E

Although disappointed {{not to be able to}} collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that [...] "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers.

[...] However, Caine later claimed: [...] "I have never seen it , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!"

500|$|Paul McCartney said {{he came up}} {{with the}} title [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] during one of his first visits to his {{property}} High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road [...] "stretching up into the hills" [...] in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction his personal life was taking in the autumn of 1968, after he had separated from his fiancée Jane Asher, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: [...] "I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> song, imagining {{it was going to be}} done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally titled as [...] "What Doesn't Kill You", [...] "Stronger" [...] {{was written}} by Jörgen Elofsson, Ali Tamposi, David Gamson, and Greg Kurstin in September 2010. In an {{interview}} with American Songwriter, Tamposi revealed that the song {{was inspired by the}} Friedrich Nietzsche adage ("That which does not kill us makes us stronger") that her mother told her as advice. Although Tamposi found the phrase as saccharine, she submitted it as an idea to Elofsson and Gamson during their writing sessions. Elofsson originally intended [...] "Stronger" [...] for Leona Lewis, who turned it down in the process. Tamposi's manager, Tom Maffei, then had one of his producers, Matty Trump, to produce a demo track later to be pitched to RCA A executive Jeff Aldrich, who later gave the song to Clarkson. Tamposi revealed that Clarkson had also altered a lyric from the track. Aldrich had then commissioned Greg Kurstin, whom Clarkson wanted to collaborate with, to produce and add additional writing to the final version. Kurstin recalled, [...] "I rethought the music part of it, I guess. It had a different tempo, beat, chords, and I kinda just came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> guitar riff that goes into the verse, {{and that was the first}} thing that I kinda contributed just changed the feel of the song." [...] The song's uplifting theme of empowerment led Clarkson to name her fifth studio album Stronger. saying that it is one of her favorite songs in the album, she said, [...] "Everybody loves the message 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' It's a perfect representation of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Gosling {{played an}} {{introvert}} who {{falls in love}} with a sex doll in the 2007 film Lars and the Real Girl. He drew inspiration from James Stewart's performance in Harvey. Roger Ebert felt [...] "a film about a life-sized love doll" [...] had been turned into [...] "a life-affirming statement of hope" [...] because of [...] "a performance by Ryan Gosling that says things that cannot be said". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post described his performance as [...] "a small miracle ... because he changes and grows so imperceptibly before our eyes." [...] However, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt [...] "the performance is a rare miscalculation in a mostly brilliant career." [...] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The film was a box office failure, failing to recoup its $12 million production budget. Gosling starred opposite Anthony Hopkins in the 2007 courtroom thriller Fracture. He originally turned down the role, but changed his mind when Hopkins signed on. Gosling noted that he was drawn to his character, Willie, because he had flaws and seemed like a real person. He spent time shadowing lawyers and observing courtroom proceedings in preparation for the role. Claudia Puig of USA Today declared that [...] "watching a veteran like Hopkins verbally joust with one of the best young actors in Hollywood is worth the price of admission". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt it was a treat to watch [...] "the spectacle of that crafty scene stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> equally cunning screen nibbler Ryan Gosling ... Each actor is playing a pulp type rather than a fully formed individual, but both fill in the blanks with an alchemical mix of professional and personal charisma." [...] The film grossed over $91 million worldwide.|$|E
