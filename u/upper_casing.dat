50|$|Flow-through tests {{typically}} come in {{the form}} of cassettes divided into four parts: an <b>upper</b> <b>casing,</b> a reactive membrane panel, an absorbent panel, and a lower casing. To perform a test, a diluted sample is applied to the reactive membrane panel and flows through to the absorbent pad, with the target analyte being captured in the membrane. The membrane is then washed to remove unbound, non-target molecules, washed again with a solution containing a signal reagent, and washed again to remove unbound signal reagent. If the analyte was present in the original sample, then by the end of this process it should be bound to the membrane, with the signal reagent bound to it, revealing (usually visually) the presence of the analyte on the membrane.|$|E
50|$|Explorer and Excalibur were {{popularly known}} as the blonde {{submarines}} because of their hydrogen peroxide fuel and they served a useful purpose as high-speed targets for the Royal Navys anti-submarine forces. Their main use, however, was to finally prove that HTP was impractical as an air-independent propulsion for submarine use. The volatile HTP was carried in special bags outside the inner pressure hull, and were prone to exploding unexpectedly. Additionally, the engine room (which was not manned while under way) would often be the scene of flames appearing {{on the top of}} the combustion chamber, and on at least one occasion the crew were forced to evacuate the pressure hull and stand on the <b>upper</b> <b>casing</b> to avoid fumes which had suddenly filled the boat.

The differential equation of axial equilibrium, including the foundation stiffnesses, is solved {{by use of}} cubic axial finite elements. The analysis is applied to 101 m of a vertical 914 -mm (36 -in.) casing supporting a 559 -mm (22 -in.) casing running from 3 m above the mudline to {{near the bottom of}} the 1201 -m hole. The <b>upper</b> <b>casing</b> is supported by a region of layered clay sediments. The lower casing has a long openhole region, followed by a bottom region encased in cement. A series of loading increments is applied, with the connection of the tree/blowout preventer (BOP) as the last. The settlement at the mudline was calculated to be less than 0. 1 m. This study shows that for weak upper foundations, a good cement job is needed to support the tree/BOP without large mudline settlements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{preferred}} {{case when}} designing a ground-source heat pump (GSHP) {{system for a}} single-family house in Sweden is to drill a single borehole to the depth required for the desired energy extraction. There are however situations when the local geological, hydrological or other conditions prohibit drilling to the required depth, and therefore two shorter boreholes are drilled. This paper analyses the thermal and economic consequences of drilling two shorter boreholes instead of one deeper borehole for a typical Swedish single family house. A series of simulation-based analyses are presented; the first accounts only for the first order effects- the shorter borehole length and thermal interaction between the two boreholes. Then, second order effects – the geothermal gradient, extra horizontal piping {{in the case of}} two vertical boreholes, and different hydraulic resistances – are analyzed. The analyses look at the thermal performance of the ground heat exchangers, the resulting heat pump and circulating pump energy consumption, electrical energy costs, and different first costs due to differences in material usage, <b>upper</b> <b>casing</b> requirements and costs required for drilling and installation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{environment}} of HTHP and high H 2 S, the sour gas enters into the annulus {{as a result of}} various factors, leading to annulus pressure and inducing the risk of the stress corrosion cracking in the oil string or the <b>upper</b> <b>casing.</b> To solve the problem, {{the environment}}al fracture toughness of C 110 high strength casing steel was tested in the NACE A solution and the wellbore protection fluid in simulated conditions in the CORTEST pressure testing system and homemade HTHP autoclave using NACE DCB method in this paper. Wellbore protection fluid is a corrosion inhibitor for steel in oil pipe and annulus. The results indicate that the environmental fracture toughness KISSC of C 110 casing steel is 22. 78 MPa•m 1 / 2, showing strong environmental cracking sensitivity in the standard NACE A solution. In the wellbore protection fluid under the simulated down hole conditions, where the partial pressure of H 2 S is 1 MPa, the partial pressure of CO 2 is 0. 6 MPa, the total pressure is 48 Mpa and the temperature is 110 °C, it has good resistance to stress corrosion cracking. It can be concluded that excellent wellbore protection fluid greatly increases the resistance of the material properties to environmental cracking. Research results in the paper provide a reference to the safe operation and management to the annulus pressure well in high sour gas fields...|$|E
40|$|The key well design issues {{considered}} {{in this paper}} are {{the length of the}} intake section; the hydraulic efficiency of the well; the length of grouted <b>upper</b> <b>casing</b> for wells in fractured rock aquifers and the potential trade-off between well yield and security against pollution; and the economics of well design. For wells in thick, relatively uniform unconsolidated aquifers, the well depth and screen length can be estimated using a simple discharge-drawdown relationship. This approach can help avoid constructing unnecessarily deep wells if alternative guidance to screen the bottom third of the aquifer was followed in such situations. Hydraulic efficiency is an important consideration in well design: the paper highlights that whereas screen entrance velocity has been a topic of much discussion in the literature, well upflow velocity has received less attention, but can be an important contributor to well losses in small diameter screens. In fractured hard rock aquifers, there may be a compromise required in well design between maximising well yield by exploiting shallow fracture zones whilst also providing adequate sanitary protection to the well by installing an upper grouted casing. Recent data from Ireland on the distribution of hydraulic conductivity with depth in poorly productive fractured rock aquifers are used to calculate the reduction in well yield that would result from increasing the length of the grouted upper well casing. Economic aspects of well design are especially important where there are a large number of wells to be drilled and/or where wells are required in poor rural communities in developing countries. The principles of cost-effective boreholes for developing countries are summarised, noting the opportunities for small-diameter shallow wells constructed with inexpensive manual or lightweight mechanical drilling rigs...|$|E

40|$|Fatigue of {{wellhead}} at subsea-completed wells is {{a growing}} problem in the offshore industry. It has been a large technology development in the offshore industry. This has resulted in an extension in the expected life for subsea wells. This partly due to new technology which allow for drilling of more and more complex side-tracks in already existing wells and the considerably well maintenance performed to extend the production phase of the subsea wells. Despite the technology development the subsea wellhead has remained the same for decades. The industry also has been moving to deeper and deeper water depth. This has led to larger drilling rigs and equipment suited for deep water and now challenges {{regarding the use of}} deep water rigs and equipment in shallow waters have appeared in the industry. It is therefore of interest to investigate the effects of using equipment designed for deeper water in operations on shallow water. Recently the industry has become more and more aware that the transition area between the <b>upper</b> <b>casing</b> and the wellhead is subjected to large bending forces of such an extent that it provides a limited fatigue life for the wellhead. Cracks in this area could lead to a leakage and the well will be lost. A leakage could both have large environmental as economic consequences. In this thesis computer software as Riflex, Gensod and Abaqus is used to perform a riser system analysis in order to carry out a fatigue life assessment of the subsea wellhead. A global analysis model is created in Riflex. The Gensod software is used to create the soil interaction between the conductor and the different soil layers. A Matlab code is generated to apply the P-y curves as nonlinear springs in Riflex. The drilling rig Deepsea Atlantic and its riser system is the system modeled in this thesis. The rig has experienced fatigue problems in a drilling operation at the Gullfaks field in the North Sea. The modeled environment therefore is modeled as the Gullfaks field with corresponding sea depth, current, waves and soil condition. The results from the global analysis carried out in Riflex makes up the load basis for a local analysis carried out in the FEM analysis software Abaqus Cae. The results are post processed in order to evaluate the safety margin in relation to the fatigue capacity of the wellhead. The investigation of forces in the global analysis shows that the transition area in the wellhead is subjected to large bending moments and corresponding bending stress. The fatigue life assessment results in a fatigue life for the wellhead that is not sufficient to be classified as safe regarding fatigue for all the drilling programs carried out in the industry today. It has been carried out parameter studies regarding use of a light weight BOP and so-called high fatigue wellhead. Also the effect the different effective level of cement between the 22 ” casing and the conductor have on the fatigue life has been investigated. The fatigue assessment gives a resulting fatigue life that is not sufficient to carry out all the drilling programs in the industry today in the wellheads safe life regarding fatigue. The implementation of a light weight BOP has small impact on the fatigue life for the wellhead. A high fatigue wellhead gives an increase in the fatigue life and the combined light weight BOP and high fatigue wellhead gives almost twice the fatigue life as the heavy BOP system today. For all the parameter studies, it appears that the effect of the effective level of cement has large impact on the fatigue life. The cement life providing the largest fatigue life is cement level in-between a high or low cement level. However dependency on the level of cement is not recommended. </p...|$|E
