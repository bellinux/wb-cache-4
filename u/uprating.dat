5|$|To {{mark the}} 40th anniversary of Naim Audio and the 30th {{birthday}} {{of the original}} NAIT, Naim unveiled a new 3-product range under the NAIT brand: the NAIT 5si, NAIT XS 2 and SUPERNAIT 2. The range has seen a general <b>uprating</b> of the transformer compared with the versions they replaced, allowing for better power delivery. The manufacturer claims use of better components in critical areas and new circuitry. All three models have built-in headphone amplifiers. The digital–analogue converter has been removed as being available either as a separate unit, {{or as part of}} the Uniti.|$|E
25|$|Many {{existing}} hydroelectric dams {{are fairly}} old (for example, the Hoover Dam {{was built in}} the 1930s), and their original design predated the newer intermittent power sources such as wind and solar by decades. A hydroelectric dam originally built to provide baseload power will have its generators sized according to the average flow of water into the reservoir. <b>Uprating</b> such a dam with additional generators increases its peak power output capacity, thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid energy storage unit. The United States Bureau of Reclamation reports an investment cost of $69 per kilowatt capacity to uprate an existing dam, compared to more than $400 per kilowatt for oil-fired peaking generators. While an uprated hydroelectric dam does not directly store excess energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by accumulating its own fuel – incoming river water – during periods of high output from other generating units. Functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way, the uprated dam {{is one of the most}} efficient forms of energy storage, because it has no pumping losses to fill its reservoir, only increased losses to evaporation and leakage.|$|E
500|$|Early B.1s were engined {{with the}} Olympus 101. Later {{aircraft}} were delivered with Olympus 102s. All Olympus 102s became the Olympus 104 of [...] thrust on overhaul and ultimately [...] thrust on <b>uprating.</b> The first B.2 flew with the second-generation Olympus 200 of [...] thrust, design of {{which began in}} 1952. Subsequent B.2s were engined with either the uprated Olympus 201 of [...] thrust or the Olympus 301 of [...] thrust. The Olympus 201 was designated 202 on being fitted with a rapid air starter. The engine would later be developed into a reheated (afterburning) powerplant for the cancelled supersonic BAC TSR-2 strike bomber and the supersonic passenger transport Concorde.|$|E
40|$|This Standard Review Plan (SRP) section {{provides}} general {{guidelines for}} reviewing proposed extended power <b>uprate</b> (EPU) power ascension testing programs. This review provides {{assurance that the}} proposed testing programs adequately demonstrate that plant structures, systems, and components (SSCs) important to safety that {{are affected by the}} proposed power <b>uprate</b> will perform satisfactorily in service at the proposed <b>uprated</b> power level. There are three types of power <b>uprates.</b> Measurement uncertainty recapture power <b>uprates</b> involve power increases of less than 2 percent, and are achieved by implementing enhanced techniques for calculating reactor power. Stretch power <b>uprates</b> typically involve power increases of up to 7 percent and do not generally involve major plant modifications. EPUs involve power increases greater than stretch power <b>uprates</b> and have been approved for increases as high as 20 percent. EPUs usually involve significant modifications to major balance of plant (BOP) equipment. A power <b>uprate</b> is classified as an EPU based on a combination of the magnitude of the proposed power increase and the plant modifications necessary to support the requested <b>uprate.</b> This SRP applies only to EPU license amendment requests (LARs) ...|$|R

500|$|The Saturn IB was an {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} Saturn I. The S-IB first stage increased the thrust to [...] by <b>uprating</b> the H-1 engine. The second stage replaced the S-IV with the S-IVB-200, powered by a single J-2 engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with LOX, to produce [...] of thrust. A restartable version of the S-IVB {{was used as the}} third stage of the Saturn V. The Saturn IB could send over [...] into low Earth orbit, sufficient for a partially fueled CSM or the LM. Saturn IB launch vehicles and flights were designated with an AS-200 series number, [...] "AS" [...] indicating [...] "Apollo Saturn" [...] and the [...] "2" [...] indicating the second member of the Saturn rocket family.|$|E
500|$|Before {{water from}} Lake Mead reaches the turbines, {{it enters the}} intake towers and then four {{gradually}} narrowing penstocks which funnel the water down towards the powerhouse. The intakes provide a maximum hydraulic head (water pressure) of [...] as the water reaches a speed of about [...] The entire flow of the Colorado River passes through the turbines. The spillways and outlet works (jet-flow gates) are rarely used. The jet-flow gates, located in concrete structures [...] above the river, and also at the outlets of the inner diversion tunnels at river level, {{may be used to}} divert water around the dam in emergency or flood conditions, but have never done so, and in practice are only used to drain water from the penstocks for maintenance. Following an <b>uprating</b> project from 1986 to 1993, the total gross power rating for the plant, including two 2.4 megawatt Pelton turbine-generators that power Hoover Dam's own operations is a maximum capacity of 2080 megawatts. The annual generation of Hoover Dam varies. The maximum net generation was 10.348 TWh in 1984, and the minimum since 1940 was 2.648 TWh in 1956. The average power generated was 4.2 TWh/year for 1947–2008. In 2015, the dam generated 3.6 TWh.|$|E

5000|$|General Electric built ten <b>uprated</b> U25Cs in 1965. Facing the {{competitive}} {{pressure of the}} second generation horsepower race GE built these units with increased horsepower. The Alco C628 had more horsepower and the Alco C630 was already announced that Summer. General Motors had the EMD SD40 demonstrators working on several railroads. The increase in unit horsepower was happening that year. The <b>uprated</b> units were built for three railroads that were already operating the U25C. The first <b>uprated</b> units were built for the Northern Pacific between May and July 1965. These were NP #2518-2520 and were rated at 2750 horsepower. Three more <b>uprated</b> U25Cs were built as Atlantic Coast Line #3011-3013 in December 1965. The ACL units were rated at 2800 horsepower. The last four <b>uprated</b> U25Cs were rated at 2800 horsepower and were built for the Pennsylvania Railroad in December 1965. These were PRR #6516-6519. Six additional PRR U25Cs were <b>uprated</b> to 2800 horsepower: 6500-6503, 6510-6511. In early 1966 General Electric began offering the 2800 horsepower U28C.
