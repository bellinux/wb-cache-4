50|$|Each {{guitar pick}} {{made of wood}} has its own unique {{properties}} and signature sound {{as a result of}} differences in density, hardness and cellular structure. Most wood picks produce a warmer tone than plastics or metals. To withstand the rigors of picking and strumming only the hardest woods are used for picks—including hardwoods like African Blackwood, Bocote, Cocobolo, Lignum vitae, Rosewood, and Zebrawood. While the thick and sometimes rough edge of <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>pick</b> may create <b>a</b> fair amount of drag at first, <b>wooden</b> <b>picks</b> are generally easy to break in and may even do so quicker than plastic picks. After a couple of hundred strokes, the metal guitar strings wear down the edge and create a smoother pass over the strings.|$|R
5000|$|Ziryab {{is said to}} have {{improved}} the Oud (or Laúd) by adding a fifth pair of strings, and using an eagle's beak or quill instead of <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>pick.</b> Ziryab also dyed the four strings a color to symbolize the Aristotelian humors, and the fifth string to represent the soul. [...] He {{is said to have}} created a unique and influential style of musical performance, and written songs that were performed in Iberia for generations. He was a great influence on Spanish music, and is considered the founder of the Andalusian music traditions of North Africa.|$|R
50|$|Bronze disease {{ranges from}} vivid green to pastel green. It is {{commonly}} {{present in all}} colours in this range due to the series of reactions that cause it and {{there may also be}} tiny, possibly microscopic, blue crystals. Bronze disease typically affects isolated patches of the object in severe cases being a visibly and tactilely raised bloom of microscopic crystals as well as being associated with pitting. The patches of bronze disease can be scraped off the surface using a fingernail or <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>pick.</b> These properties are all in comparison with verdigris, which is normally a duller shade, uniform across the whole of the affected object, and cannot be scratched off with wood or fingernails. Unlike bronze disease, verdigris serves to protect the metal.|$|R
5|$|The {{church was}} founded in 1848, but a local hall was used for {{services}} <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> church was built in 1849. The wooden structure eventually proved inadequate and a larger church designed by Peabody and Stearns was built of local fieldstone at the current location between 1897 and 1898.|$|R

50|$|The first Catholic missionaries {{arrived in}} the area in around 1815, at which point Sault was an outpost of the Northwest Company. The Catholic parish in the {{adjoining}} city of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan served Catholics for several years <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> church was constructed for the Parish of the Sacred Heart in 1846. In 1875, the present church building opened, as the region's Catholic population, mainly of French Canadian and Irish immigrant origin, began to grow rapidly.

50|$|The high-backed, Gothic-style {{armchair}} {{was carved}} from oak {{at some point}} between the summer of 1297 and March 1300 by the carpenter Walter of Durham. At first, the king ordered for the chair {{to be made of}} bronze, but he changed his mind and decided it should be made of timber. The chair is the oldest dated piece of English furniture made by a known artist. Since the 14th century, all crowned English and British monarchs have been seated in this chair at the moment of coronation, with the exception of Queen Mary II, who was crowned on a copy of the chair.

50|$|Some of {{the fabric}} of the current {{building}} is from the 16th century. Further work was undertaken in the 17th century when the church was known as All Saints. In 1810 a south extension was built, although the Elizabethan windows were relocated and reused in the south wall. The church fell into a state if disrepair and in 1856 suffered a Victorian restoration under the architect C.E. Giles. The priest responsible for the rebuilding and restoration of 1856 to 1859, Samuel Heathcote (at the Church 1854 to 1906), was appointed Perpetual curate but was signing the registers as Vicar from 21 November 1889 showing that Williton had become a parish separate from Watchet. The church had <b>a</b> small spire <b>until</b> it was damaged during a storm after which the bells were housed <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> bellcote <b>until</b> <b>a</b> new stone one was built in 1896.|$|R

5000|$|The sarod {{is widely}} {{believed}} to have descended from the Afghan rubab, a similar instrument originating in Central Asia and Afghanistan. Many scholars of Indian classical music believe that sarod {{is a combination of}} the ancient Chitra veena, the medieval Rabab and modern Sursingar. Some scholars even contend that a similar instrument may have existed about two thousand years ago in ancient India during the ages of the Gupta kings. In fact, a Gupta period coin depicts the great king Samudragupta playing a Veena, which many believe to be the precursor of the Sarod.The origin of most of the present Indian classical instruments along with the Sitar, Sarod and others lie in the ancient Indian instruments. They had the practice of adding the word Veena to every instrument like the Rudra Veena, Gayatri Veena, Saraswati Veena, Chitra Veena, Sarda Veena etc.The shape and appearance of the present Indian musical Instruments like the Sitar and Sarode with the decorated domes are exactly like the ancient musical instruments the Veenas. The Sarod originated from Sarda Veena, modified with time.There is a small Indian musical instrument also like a small sarod named Dotara which is quite ancient.As in the case of everything the present is only related to the ancient period, the origin of the present Indian musical instruments are related to the musical instruments of the past, the several Veenas..(Pg 6, Indian musical Instruments written by Sarodia Abanindra Maitra) [...]The present Indian Traces of similar Rabab style instruments can also be found in southern India, especially in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, where it is known as the Swarbat. The folk Rabab, an instrument popular in north India, had <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> fingerboard, its strings were made of silk, cotton or gut, and it was played with <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>pick.</b> In history, reference is also made to a Sharadiya Veena from which the name Sarod may have been derived.|$|R

50|$|James Swisher {{settled on}} a bluff in present-day South Austin {{with his family in}} 1846, and {{initially}} operated a tavern and a hotel. It was Swisher who granted Travis County the right-of-way to begin construction of a highway to San Antonio in 1852. Sensing the commercial opportunities that the new highway would bring, Swisher also began operating a ferry service across the Colorado River that same year. The establishment of Swisher's ferry and the Post Road in the early 1850s encouraged modest settlement in South Austin, particularly along the road, such as the Texas School for the Deaf in 1856. Further growth was halted by the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction. <b>Until</b> the <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> bridge was finally built in 1876, South Austinites were dependent on ferry service and pontoon bridges to get to and from Downtown Austin. The bridge made South Austin more accessible than ever before, and in 1877 John Milton Swisher (James' son) subdivided 23 acres of the family farm along the San Antonio Road. It was to become Austin's first urban addition south of the Colorado River.|$|R
5000|$|The Tooele Valley Railway {{was founded}} in 1908, by the Utah Consolidated Mining Company [...] to connect the International Smelter to the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad (later bought out by the Union Pacific Railroad). In 1917 the Western Pacific Railroad built a branch line {{to connect with the}} Tooele Valley Railway [...] The line ran from a {{connection}} with the mainline on the west end of Tooele, Utah, to the smelter located on the bench of the Oquirrh Mountains. A large portion of the Tooele Valley Railway was a street running railroad, traveling through Vine Street until reaching Tooele Station. The grade traveled out of the city <b>until</b> crossing <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> trestle at the mouth of Middle Canyon. In later years the trestle was filled in with rock overburden to stabilize it. The grade continued along the mountain bench until reaching the smelter. In 1937 a branch line was built connecting the line to the Elton Tunnel. The smelter closed in 1972, and the railroad lost its main revenue source. The railroad briefly served the Carr Fork Mine project during the late 1970s. The last revenue train ran on July 7, 1980.
