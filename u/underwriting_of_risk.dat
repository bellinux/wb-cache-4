40|$|The {{principle}} of zero utility in premium rating, which has gained some currency, is considered. If the associated utility function {{is assumed to}} be of the exponential type, premiums constructed according to the {{principle of}} zero utility have especially attractive additive and iterative properties. These properties are lost if the assumption of exponential utility is dropped, as apparently is required by a realistic assessment of the industry. This necessitates an examination of premium rating under nonexponential utility. Such an examination is made under 2 cases: 1. risk aversion and the relation between wealth and premiums, and 2. risk aversion and the order <b>of</b> the <b>underwriting</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks.</b> If 2 utility functions are compared in the first instance, it is found that the relative risk aversion between them is strongly related to the concavity properties of their identity function.

40|$|Using {{the records}} of several leading 19 th century issuing houses, this paper {{analyses}} the transformation <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> practices in London's primary sovereign bond market from 1870 to 1914. It shows how underwriting risk developed from being a liability, which market intermediaries sought to avoid, to becoming a valuable financial commodity. The impetus for this development was increased competition in the loan business from the 1880 s onwards, which weakened the negotiating position of issuing houses and forced them to shoulder an increasing share <b>of</b> the <b>underwriting</b> <b>risk.</b> Issuing houses had to find methods {{to deal with this}} risk, but they were initially hamstrung by public perception <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> as detrimental to the interests of ordinary investors. Firms began to adopt informal underwriting arrangements, with limited scope, but these only allowed for a relatively limited distribution <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> <b>risk</b> to third parties, the danger of which was exposed during the Baring crisis. Consequently formal underwriting syndicates were developed, allowing for a greater dissemination <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> <b>risk.</b> This meant that the risk associated with issuing loans could be broken down into sufficiently small tranches so that no underwriter had to shoulder a risk greater than what he desired. As a result underwriting risk came {{to be seen as a}} profitable investment opportunity, a financial commodity in its own right, and a means of patronage for issuing houses...|$|R

40|$|Adult {{polycystic kidney}} disease (APKD) is a single-gene {{autosomal}} dominant genetic disorder leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD, meaning kidney failure). It is associated with mutations {{in at least two}} genes, APKD 1 and APKD 2, but diagnosis is mostly by ultrasonography. We propose a model for critical illness (CI) insurance and estimate rates of onset of ESRD from APKD using two studies. Other events leading to claims under CI policies are included in the model, which we use to study (a) extra premiums under CI policies if the presence of an APKD mutation is known, and (b) the possible costs arising from adverse selection if this information is unavailable to insurers. The extra premiums are typically very high, but because APKD is rare, the possible cost of adverse selection is low. However, APKD is just one of a significant number of single-gene disorders, and this benign conclusion cannot be assumed to apply to all genetic disorders taken together. Moreover, ignoring known genetic risks in underwriting sets a precedent that could have unintended consequences for the <b>underwriting</b> <b>of</b> nongenetic <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> similar magnitude...|$|R

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2009 Dr. John WilliamsPrevious research that attempted to evaluate Australian farmers’ decision-making in a high risk environment has often been inconclusive and contradictory. The risks associated with wheat production, marketing, and hedging/pricing are high in Australia due to irregular rainfall, distance from major markets, and difficulties with suitable hedging benchmarks. Much of the overseas research has limited value to Australia because <b>of</b> higher farming <b>risks,</b> deregulated markets, no price/ income protection policies, and no public <b>underwriting</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks.</b> There have been few in-depth studies that have examined relevant marketing methods and hedging strategies from a behavioural decision-making perspective in a deregulated market. In this research, the Fisher Exact Test (a variation of the Chi-square test) analysed five marketing strategies and six hedging/pricing methods used by wheat growers, across eighteen key management factors and seventeen risk attitude/adoption characteristics in NSW for the 2005 production year, with the results compared with South Australia and Victoria. The findings were then used to examine eight research questions relating to decision-making. Different management approaches by Australian wheat growers were found to affect marketing decision-making more than hedging decision-making which was more influenced by risk perception. Cash flow might be a greater contributing factor leading to emotional anxiety than either the marketing method or hedging strategy. Growers {{were more likely to}} perceive that knowledge of variable costs of production led to price risk management, and {{were also more likely to}} perceive that they target more realistic price levels when variable costs are known. Alternatively, price risk management was an incentive to lower variable costs of production. A wheat grower's farm size, debt, and farming experience influenced the choice of marketing method or hedging strategy, whilst age did not, while the impact of training was inconclusive. Regret and avoidance in decision-making was high for wheat growers. Rogers’ adoption criteria have some influence on decision-making. There was much evidence to support the application of the Kahneman and Tversky’s ‘certainty effect’ proposition to Australian wheat growers. Open Acces...|$|R

It begins by explaining how information problems affect the efficiency of the allocation <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> between insurer and reinsurer, and how long-term implicit contracts between insurers and reinsurers allow the inclusion of new information in the pricing of both future and past reinsurance coverage. Because of these features, the ceding company purchases a more efficient quantity of reinsurance. Specifically, such arrangements lead to more reinsurance coverage, higher insurer profits, and lower expected distress in the industry. It is, in short, Pareto improving. ...|$|R

Although such risk classification can substantially increase a company's profitability, {{these products are}} uncommon except for the well established U. K. market. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze this issue and make several contributions to the literature. First, we de-scribe enhanced, impaired life, and care annuities, and then discuss the underwriting process and un-derwriting risk related thereto. Second, we propose a theoretical model to determine the optimal profit-maximizing risk classification system for substandard annuities. Based on the model framework and for given price-demand dependencies, we formally show the effect of classification costs and costs <b>of</b> <b>underwriting</b> <b>risk</b> on profitability for insurers. Risk classes are distinguished by the average mortality of contained insureds, whereby mortality heterogeneity is included {{by means of a}} frailty model. Third, we discuss key aspects regarding a practical implementation of our model as well as possible market entry barriers for substandard annuity providers...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{classification}} is {{an important}} part of the actuarial process in Insurance companies. It allows for the <b>underwriting</b> <b>of</b> the best <b>risks,</b> through an appropriate choice of classification variables, and helps set fair premiums in rate-making. Logistic regression is one of the sophisticated statistical methods used by the banking industry to select credit rating variables. Extending the method to insurance risk classification seems natural. But Insurance risks are usually classified in a larger number of classes than good and bad, as is usually the case in credit rating. Here we consider a model generalization to extend the use of logistic regression to insurance risk classification. Since insurance data presents catastrophic losses and heavy tail claim distributions, robust estimation will be important. A new robust regression estimator for the logistic model, both in the binary and multinomial response cases, is proposed. Its asymptotic properties are also studied. ...|$|R

40|$|Risk {{classification}} is {{an important}} actuarial process for insurance companies. It allows for the <b>underwriting</b> <b>of</b> the best <b>risks,</b> through an appropriate choice of classification variables, and helps set fair premiums in rate-making. Currently, insurance companies mainly use ad-hoc methods for risk classification, more often based {{on the type of}} expenses covered than on the distribution of the corresponding losses. The selection of classification variables is also, in general, based on rate-making variables rather than on an optimal choice criteria based on statistical methods. It is known that logistic regression is among the many sophisticated statistical methods used by the banking industry in order to select credit rating variables. Extending the method to insurance risks seems only natural. Insurance risks are not usually classified in only two categories, good and bad, as can be the case in credit rating, but in a larger number of classes. Here we consider the generalization of the model to extend the use of logistic regression to insurance risk classification. Since insurance data presents catastrophic losses and heavy tailed claim distributions, a robust estimation analysis is very important. It is carefully studied here...|$|R
40|$|The {{quest for}} optimal {{reinsurance}} design has remained an interesting problem among insurers, reinsurers, and academicians. An {{appropriate use of}} reinsurance could reduce the <b>underwriting</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> an insurer and thereby enhance its value. This paper complements the existing research on optimal reinsurance by proposing another model for {{the determination of the}} optimal reinsurance design. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the value-at-risk <b>of</b> the net <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the insurer while subjecting to a profitability constraint. The proposed optimal reinsurance model, therefore, has the advantage of exploiting the classical tradeoff between risk and reward. Under the additional assumptions that the reinsurance premium is determined by the expectation premium principle and the ceded loss function is confined to a class of increasing and convex functions, explicit solutions are derived. Depending on the <b>risk</b> measure's level <b>of</b> confidence, the safety loading for the reinsurance premium, and the expected profit guaranteed for the insurer, we establish conditions for the existence of reinsurance. When it is optimal to cede the insurer's risk, the optimal reinsurance design could be in the form of pure stop-loss reinsurance, quota-share reinsurance, or a combination of stop-loss and quota-share reinsurance. ...|$|R

The estimated economic capital (EC) for the entire insurance industry considerably varies across different risk measures and vine copula models. In addition, less than the risk-based capital (RBC) charge assessed based on the standard model of RN 69 and amounted to 96, 943, 391 million of Iran Rials. Therefore, {{it was concluded that}} using the Vine copula method and allowing symmetry and tail dependence for pairs <b>of</b> business lines’ <b>risks</b> in the risk aggregation process leads to overestimation <b>of</b> the RBC <b>risk</b> charge, as compared to the estimated results of simple and linear aggregation methods of such standard model.

40|$|<b>Underwriting</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> rare {{disorders}} in long-term insurance often relies on rates of onset estimated from quite small epidemiological studies. These estimates can have considerable sampling uncertainty and any function based upon them, {{such as a}} premium rate, is also an estimate subject to uncertainty. This is particularly relevant {{in the case of}} genetic disorders, because the acceptable use of genetic information may depend on establishing its reliability as a measure <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> The sampling distribution of a premium rate is hard to estimate without access to the original data, which is rarely possible. From two studies of adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) we obtain, not the original data, but the cases and exposures used for Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival probability. We use three resampling methods with these data, namely: (a) the standard bootstrap; (b) the weird bootstrap; and (c) simulation of censored random lifetimes. Rates of onset were obtained from each simulated sample using kernel-smoothed Nelson-Aalen estimates, hence critical illness insurance premium rates for a mutation carrier or a member of an affected family. From 10, 000 such samples we estimate the sampling distributions of the premium rates, finding considerable uncertainty. Very careful consideration should be given before using small-sample epidemiological data to deal with insurance problems. ...|$|R
