40|$|Environmental {{processes}} and biological community structures change along fluvial gradients within coastal river basins; the accumulation and associated risk of metal contamination {{would also be}} expected to change from <b>upstream</b> to downstream <b>reaches.</b> Speciation and degrees of contamination of metals in sediments from the upstream and downstream of river catchments of the southern Bohai Sea were investigated. The mean concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb from <b>upstream</b> <b>reaches</b> were 82. 6, 157, 63. 6, 26. 6, 0. 18 and 24. 9 mg/kg, respectively.

Most of the Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni and Pb in sediments from both the <b>upstream</b> and downstream <b>reaches</b> was mainly associated with the residual fraction. However, Cd was preferentially bound to the exchangeable phase. A cluster {{analysis was used to}} study the degree of association between sites, and three distinct clusters were identified in both upstream and downstream sediments.

30|$|Nitrogen and {{phosphorous}} availability {{may limit}} primary productivity, with co-limitation occurring commonly (Corkum 1996; Tank and Dodds 2003; Harpole et al. 2011). Periphyton chlorophyll-a biomass levels on the NDS growth filters {{were significantly higher}} with the upstream N + P treatment, but only compared to the downstream control and N-addition treatment. The lack of within-reach significance between the control and any nutrient-addition treatment implies a lack of nutrient limitation for both reaches. The negative N/C and P/C ratio values in the <b>upstream</b> <b>reach,</b> plus the very small N + P/C value, also indicates that periphyton responses were stimulated to a minor degree only by the dual nutrient treatment. Although the <b>upstream</b> <b>reach</b> had the lowest ambient N and P levels and was also the only not classified as a eutrophic system according to the criteria established by Dodds et al.

40|$|I sampled macroinvertebrates in May, July, and October 2008 in Uvas Creek, a reservoir-regulated {{stream in}} south Santa Clara County, California, {{to assess what}} factors (including canopy closure, turbidity, and stream flow) {{downstream}} of the reservoir were related to food availability for rearing juvenile Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss). I found benthic and drifting macroinvertebrate biomass was considerably greater during most months in the more open-canopied two sites in the downstream reach {{as compared to the}} densely shaded, more turbid and silty two sites in the <b>upstream</b> <b>reach.</b> Abundance of important drifting aquatic invertebrates in May (chironomids, simuliids, and baetids) was proportional to benthic abundance, but large hydropsychids were relatively scarce in the drift. Terrestrial drift abundance correlated with canopy density, but differences were small compared to the substantial increase in aquatic drift in sunnier sites. Thinning of the canopy at select locations and reduction of sediment input to Uvas Creek and its tributaries due to vineyard and other operations could increase benthic macroinvertebrate productivity in the <b>upstream</b> <b>reach,</b> which would increase food availability for rearing juvenile Steelhead...|$|E
40|$|The {{change of}} nonpoint source and {{freshwater}} discharge {{as a result}} of land use change might affect the water quality in a river. In the current study, a coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model was created and applied to the Danshuei River estuarine system and its adjacent coastal ocean. The hydrodynamic and water quality models were validated using observations of water surface elevation, salinity distribution and water quality state variables. The predictions of hydrodynamics, salinity, dissolved oxygen and nutrients from the model simulation quantitatively agreed with the observational data. The validated model was then used to investigate the possible effects of the nonpoint source and freshwater discharge changes at the <b>upstream</b> <b>reaches</b> on water quality conditions in the Danshuei River estuarine system. Three scenarios were investigated to predict the dissolved oxygen using model simulations. The simulated results indicated that increasing nonpoint sources at the <b>upstream</b> <b>reaches</b> degraded the dissolved oxygen under low flow conditions. However, increasing freshwater discharges at the <b>upstream</b> <b>reaches</b> would overcome the loadings of the nonpoint source, which would result in increasing the dissolved oxygen in the tidal river estuary.

40|$|We {{examined}} how community measures (density, biomass, and richness) and community composition {{were related to}} microhabitat variables (including hydraulic parameters, substrate, and food resources) in La Tordera stream in Catalonia (NE Spain). We collected macroinvertebrate samples on six dates between November 2001 and September 2002 upstream and downstream of a point source input. Macroinvertebrate density and biomass were positively correlated with food resources and complexity of habitat architecture (benthic organic matter, chlorophyll-a, vascular plants, and mosses) while taxa richness was negatively correlated with conventional (water velocity and depth) and complex hydraulic parameters (Froude number, Reynolds number, roughness shear velocity). Inorganic substrate exerted a minor influence on macroinvertebrate distribution. Ordination analysis revealed that the microhabitat variables of major significance at the two reaches were CPOM, chlorophyll-a, filamentous algae, and maximum velocity. Sand coverage was only relevant for macroinvertebrates at the <b>upstream</b> <b>reach,</b> and moss at the downstream reach. The number of significant correlations between macroinvertebrates and microhabitat variables was higher at the <b>upstream</b> <b>reach</b> than at the downstream reach mainly because of higher taxa richness.

30|$|The flood {{simulation}} {{shows that}} rainstorm or a flood {{due to the}} release of an upstream impoundment (the headwaters have several active landslides that will block the main channel when they move) will produce an increase of flow height in the <b>upstream</b> <b>reach,</b> due to the narrow and deep channel, which then spill over the fan.

Females had a stronger upstream flight than males and species varied in both flight direction and strength of the preference. Flight direction was not affected by wind or trap type. Upstream flight varied during the season and with different larval behaviours. Upstream flight increased {{with the size of}} the imago and with the abun­dance in flight.

30|$|The {{hydrological}} data analyzed {{here were}} acquired {{during the period}} 14 – 24 October, 2010, using a SBE (Sea-Bird Electronics) CTD model 37 SMPb. The CTD was deployed in the Oued Loukkos estuary using a shallow-draft, 6.8 meter-long, outboard-motor powered fishing boat, Zouhair 3, based in the port of Larache. The boat was outfitted with a temporary enclosure to house the survey and navigational equipment. The speed {{of the boat and}} the large distances covered by the survey precluded obtaining a truly synoptic measurement of the temperature and salinity. A round-trip in Zouhair 3, {{from the mouth of the}} river to the most <b>upstream</b> <b>reach</b> of the survey, 15  km, and return, required a significant portion of one cycle of the semi-diurnal tide in the Oued Loukkos. The set of temperature and salinity measurements acquired between the mouth of the river and the most <b>upstream</b> <b>reach</b> of the survey consists of 103 discrete CTD casts and four continuous near-surface (0.2 - 0.5  m) tows of the CTD along the main axis of the estuary. Fifty-seven of the CTD casts were co-located with sites throughout the estuary where a uniform distribution of sediment samples was collected from the river bed. Taken as a whole, the CTD data adequately provide evidence to support classification of the Oued Loukkos estuary.|$|E

To study {{the effect of the}} cascade reservoirs on flood routing, 363 flood peaks data of two hydrologic stations on the Hongshui River during 1971 – 2007 are collected to analyze the flood characteristics changing before or after construction of the large dam Yantan. The flood peak travel time is the main factor which is taken into consideration in this study. Statistics results show: (1) The flood peak travel time which varies with flood magnitude shows different trends before and after construction of the Yantan dam; (2) the average flood peak travel time with a smaller flood magnitude (QP= 50 %) has no obvious differences before and after the construction of Yantan dam...|$|E

30|$|Kentucky's upper Green River is a nutrient-enriched {{system that}} we {{attribute}} mainly {{to a combination of}} agricultural land-use and limestone bedrock characteristics that lead to enriched groundwater inputs in the downstream, well-developed karst reaches.

Degradation occurred in all three reaches, but degradation estimates were highest for the Restoration Reach; the longevity of the logs used to create step-pools was a concern; and larger sediment size and increased transport capacity related to the restoration are likely aiding degradation downstream.

In this research a new optimal vector interpolation method, suitable for interpolation of asynoptically measured spatial vector fields, was developed and tested. The new method was compared to scalar interpolation by kriging. The test data were spatial Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) surveys of depth average fluvial water velocity in reaches upstream and downstream of a bridge. The interpolation procedures were evaluated by interpolating the fields with various amounts of data removal, and comparing to the actual measured field using a vector correlation coefficient previously developed by Crosby et al.
