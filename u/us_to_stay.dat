We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, coming out of her head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E
500|$|After {{years of}} {{both public and}} {{political}} pressure, the provincial government announced in February2006 that it would begin twinning the entire two-lane portion of the highway from Atmore to {{the south end of}} Fort McMurray, the stretch they deemed to be the most dangerous. [...] Work began in 2006 and was estimated to take at least five years to complete. [...] The first section was completed in 2008 at a cost of $53million, stretching south from Airport Road (then Highway69) to a point south of the Highway881 intersection. [...] The Mariana Lakes Country Store near Mariana Lake was closed in September2008 {{to make way for the}} twinning. [...] It was the only service station between Wandering River and Fort McMurray, but Alberta Transportation had no other options due to the proximity of the lake and utilities. [...] The store's owner was reluctant to relinquish the property but acknowledged that upgrades to the dangerous highway were more important than the continued operation of the store. [...] "The twinning of the highway is far more important, and there really is no other way for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here," [...] she stated. [...] of tree clearing had been completed by February2010, but further work was delayed until July to protect threatened caribou populations. An additional [...] of grading near Wandering River was completed by fall2011.|$|E
500|$|In late 2010, TV Tonight {{reported}} that Neighbours would reduce crew operations in 2011 so production could be upgraded. The changes {{meant that the}} location manager and catering team were no longer required, studio shoots would be reduced from three cameras to two, and location shots will be mainly confined to the Ramsay Street and Lassiter's complex sets, with occasional filming in one-off places. Of the changes, FremantleMedia said [...] "Neighbours is undergoing a work flow upgrade to accommodate advances in technology and production techniques to ensure {{we are at the}} forefront of professionalism and efficiency." [...] They added that the show's production model had been in place since 1985 and {{that it was time to}} evolve it. On 14 March 2011, The Australian {{reported that}} Neighbours has become the first television show available to watch on a free iPhone application. Viewers are able to watch whole episodes within three hours of them airing on Eleven. Nick Spooner, the head of Ten digital media said [...] "This is part of what we call our 'three-screen approach' – broadcast, online and mobile – and it is intended to build viewer engagement with a show and our brand. This is a way for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in touch with our audience and to keep them coming back." [...] To celebrate the wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton, Neighbours filmed a specially commissioned scene for the UK episode airing on the same day as the wedding. The episode, which had already aired in Australia, marked the first time an Australian show recorded extra scenes for a UK broadcaster.|$|E

2500|$|Smart {{phones and}} social {{networking}} services enable <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> connected continuously with people around us or {{far away from}} us, which however is sometimes the root of our anxiety in social life.

There is a study that examined possible connections between FOMO and social media engagement indicating that FoMO was associated with lower need satisfaction, mood and life satisfaction.|$|E

On September 27, 2006, the 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores announced its 20-year contract with Citgo {{was coming to an}} end and would not be renewed. 7-Eleven spokeswoman Margaret Chabris said [...] "Regardless of politics, we sympathize with many Americans' concern over derogatory comments about our country and its leadership recently made by Venezuela's president.
