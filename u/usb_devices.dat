5|$|USB On-The-Go {{makes it}} {{possible}} for two <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> {{to communicate with each other}} without requiring a separate USB host. In practice, one of the <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> acts as a host for the other device.|$|E
5|$|Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) is a vendor- and device-independent {{mechanism}} for upgrading the firmware of <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> with improved versions provided by their manufacturers, offering (for example) {{a way for}} firmware bugfixes to be deployed. During the firmware upgrade operation, <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> change their operating mode effectively becoming a PROM programmer. Any class of USB device can implement this capability by following the official DFU specifications.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to limiting the total average power {{used by the}} device, the USB specification limits the inrush current (i.e., the current used to charge decoupling and filter capacitors) when the device is first connected. Otherwise, connecting a device could cause problems with the host's internal power. <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> are also required to automatically enter ultra low-power suspend mode when the USB host is suspended. Nevertheless, many USB host interfaces do not cut off the power supply to <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> when they are suspended.|$|E
50|$|A USB {{image is}} a way to boot a {{computer}} from a USB flash drive, or another <b>USB</b> <b>device.</b> The operating system loads from the <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> to make it usable. Much like a Live CD, a USB image runs off of the <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> the whole time.|$|R
5|$|When a <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> {{is first}} {{connected}} to a USB host, the <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the <b>USB</b> <b>device.</b> The data rate of the <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the <b>USB</b> <b>device's</b> information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the device {{is supported by the}} host, the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.|$|R
50|$|The <b>USB</b> {{mass storage}} <b>device</b> class (also known as USB MSC or UMS) {{is a set}} of {{computing}} communications protocols defined by the USB Implementers Forum that makes a <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> accessible to a host computing device and enables file transfers between the host and the <b>USB</b> <b>device.</b> To a host, the <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> acts as an external hard drive; the protocol set interfaces with a number of storage devices.|$|R
5|$|By default, all <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> must {{at least}} support {{endpoint}} buffer 0 (EP0). This is since EP0 {{is used for}} device control and status information during enumeration and normal operation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its intended legitimate purposes, DFU can also be exploited by uploading maliciously crafted firmware that causes <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> to spoof various other device types; one such exploiting approach is known as BadUSB.|$|E
5|$|Only {{moderate}} {{force is}} needed to insert or remove a USB cable. USB cables and small <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> are {{held in place by}} the gripping force from the receptacle (without need of the screws, clips, or thumb-turns other connectors have required).|$|E
40|$|The project aims {{to develop}} a device that allows file {{transfers}} between two <b>USB</b> memory <b>devices</b> {{without the need for}} a personal Computer. It is designed as a standalone application which allows for the backup of files from a digital camera or any <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> to another <b>USB</b> <b>Device.</b> This device can eliminate the use of a PC or laptop for transferring the data of pen drive to another pen drive or any other <b>USB</b> <b>device.</b> This Projects shows the methodology {{that can be used to}} do data communication i. e., (data transfer) between two <b>USB</b> mass Storage <b>devices</b> by using friendly ARM microcontroller and touch screen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>USB</b> movable storage <b>devices</b> {{have been}} {{bringing}} significant convenience for data interchange among computers while chances of invalid copy and sensitive data leakage are exposed. In order {{to decrease the}} leakage possibility of confidential information, unilateral control takes effect in <b>USB</b> <b>device.</b> This paper introduces how to realize the unilateral control of <b>USB</b> <b>device</b> and elaborates the key technique thereof...|$|R
5|$|Some <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a single port. This is common for external hard and optical disc drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E
5|$|Developed {{at roughly}} {{the same time as the}} USB3.1 specification, but {{distinct}} from it, the USBType-C Specification 1.0 was finalized in August 2014 and defines a new small reversible-plug connector for <b>USB</b> <b>devices.</b> The Type-C plug connects to both hosts and devices, replacing various Type-A and Type-B connectors and cables with a standard meant to be future-proof.|$|E
5|$|Some {{non-standard}} <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> use the 5V {{power supply}} without {{participating in a}} proper USB network, which negotiates power draw with the host interface. These are usually called USB decorations. Examples include USB-powered keyboard lights, fans, mug coolers and heaters, battery chargers, miniature vacuum cleaners, and even miniature lava lamps. In most cases, these items contain no digital circuitry, and thus are not standard-compliant <b>USB</b> <b>devices.</b> This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging circuitry. Prior to the USB Battery Charging Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a low-power mode (100mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into high-power mode.|$|E

5|$|The actual {{process of}} {{analysis}} can vary between investigations, but common methodologies include conducting keyword searches across the digital media (within files {{as well as}} unallocated and slack space), recovering deleted files and extraction of registry information (for example to list user accounts, or attached <b>USB</b> <b>devices).</b>|$|E
5|$|The type-A plug has an {{elongated}} rectangular cross-section, inserts into a type-A receptacle on a downstream port on a USB host or hub, and carries both power and data. Captive cables on <b>USB</b> <b>devices,</b> such as keyboards or mice, will be terminated with a type-A plug.|$|E
5|$|This {{allows the}} host to perform bus {{management}} action like enumerating new <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> via retrieving the new device device descriptors. Retrieval {{of the device}} descriptors would especially allow for determining the USB Class, VID, and PID, which are often used for determining the correct USB driver for the device.|$|E

5|$|The design {{architecture}} of USB is asymmetrical in its topology, {{consisting of a}} host, a multitude of downstream USB ports, and multiple peripheral devices connected in a tiered-star topology. Additional USB hubs may {{be included in the}} tiers, allowing branching into a tree structure with up to five tier levels. A USB host may implement multiple host controllers and each host controller may provide one or more USB ports. Up to 127 devices, including hub devices if present, may be connected to a single host controller. <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> are linked in series through hubs. One hub—built into the host controller—is the root hub.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} connectors were deliberately {{intended to}} enforce the directed topology of a USB network: type-A receptacles on host devices that supply power and type-B receptacles on target devices that draw power. This prevents users from accidentally connecting two USB power supplies to each other, {{which could lead to}} short circuits and dangerously high currents, circuit failures, or even fire. USB does not support cyclic networks and the standard connectors from incompatible <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> are themselves incompatible.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{there are}} three basic formats of USB connectors: the default or {{standard}} format intended for desktop or portable equipment (for example, on USB flash drives), the mini intended for mobile equipment (now deprecated except the Mini-B, which is used on many cameras), and the thinner micro size, for low-profile mobile equipment (most modern mobile phones). Also, there are 5 modes of USB data transfer, in order of increasing bandwidth: Low Speed (from 1.0), Full Speed (from 1.0), High Speed (from 2.0), SuperSpeed (from 3.0), and SuperSpeed+ (from 3.1); modes have differing hardware and cabling requirements. <b>USB</b> <b>devices</b> have some choice of implemented modes, and USB version is not a reliable statement of implemented modes. Modes are identified by their names and icons, and the specifications suggests that plugs and receptacles be colour-coded (SuperSpeed is identified by blue).|$|E
