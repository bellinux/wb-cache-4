40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{establishment}} of explicit bounds on the rational function solutions of a general class of equations in several variables. The first general result on Diophantine equations over function fields was discovered in 1930 [1], as an analogy on the work of Thue on number fields: it was shown that the degrees of polynomial solutions X, Y in k[z] of f(X, Y) = c are bound for each c: here f denotes an irreducible binary form over k[z] of degree at least three, and k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. The Manin-Grauert theorem [7] extended this conclusion to the rational function solutions X, Y in k(z) of any equation in two variables over k(z), provided that the curve corresponding to the equation has genus two or more: this is the analogue for function fields of the Mordell conjecture for number fields, proved by Faltings in 1983. Parsin [6] made the Manin-Grauert theorem effective by furnishing explicit bounds on the degrees of X and Y: this approach followed Grauert and Shafarevitch in relying heavily on algebraic geometry. In 1976 a different attack was made by Schmidt [8] using the theory of algebraic differential equations, first developed by Kolchin and Osgood. This method produced very good bounds for equations such as the Thue equation discussed above: for example, Schmidt provides the bound for any rational function solution X, Y in k(z) of f(X, Y) = 1, where f denotes a binary form over k(z) of degree in X and Y at least five, and which factorises into distinct linear factors. Here deg zf is the degree of f in z. In 1983 [2] the power of Diophantine approximation provided another approach to attack Dlophantine equations. over function fields. By first establishing an inequality on solutions of the <b>unit</b> <b>equation</b> in two variables, it was shown in [3, p. 122] that the bound (1) could be improved to 36 degz f, and the condition on the degree in X and Y could be relaxed to include quartic forms. In fact the principal purpose of this new approach using Diophantine approximation had been to provide algorithms for the effective construction of all the polynomial solutions of various equations: it was a surprise to find that not only were these algorithms extremely efficient, but also that the technique extended to include rational function solutions. A full account of this approach and its consequences is given in a recent tome [3...|$|E

40|$|The R-factor in the Universal Soil Loss Equation /Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE/RUSLE) {{characterizes the}} climatic {{influence}} on the average rate of soil loss. The {{way in which the}} R-factor was calculated for RUSLE differs from that for the USLE. Rainfall intensity data at 6 -min intervals from 41 long-term sites in the tropical region of Australia were analyzed to determine the discrepancy in the calculated R-factor as a result of using different <b>unit</b> energy <b>equations</b> and different rainfall thresholds. The mean annual rainfall varies from 261 to 4030 mm for the 41 sites. The calculated R-factor using the <b>unit</b> energy <b>equation</b> for the USLE is greater than that using the <b>unit</b> energy <b>equation</b> recommended for RUSLE. The typical difference is about 10 % for the tropical region of Australia. The difference tends to increase as peak rainfall intensity decreases. The percentage difference in the R-factor due to different <b>unit</b> energy <b>equations</b> was found to be significantly correlated with the ratio of the R-factor to mean annual rainfall. The discrepancy in the calculated R-factor due to different rainfall thresholds increases as mean annual rainfall decreases because the relative contribution to the R-factor from small storm events increases in low rainfall areas. Lowering the rainfall threshold from 12. 7 mm to 0. 0 mm would on average increase the calculated R-factor by 5 % for the same region. Relationships based on mean annual rainfall and the R-factor were developed so that the magnitude of the discrepancy in the calculated R-factor due to different <b>unit</b> energy <b>equations</b> and different rainfall thresholds can be readily assessed.
