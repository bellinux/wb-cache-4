25|$|Once {{the lander}} was 355 m above the ground, airbags were {{inflated}} {{in less than}} a second using three catalytically cooled solid rocket motors that served as gas generators. The airbags were made of 4 inter-connected multi-layer vectran bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander. They were designed and tested to accommodate grazing angle impacts as high as 28m/s. However, as the airbags were designed for no more than about 15m/s vertical impacts, three solid retrorockets were mounted above the lander in the backshell. These were fired at 98m above the ground. The lander's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0m/s between 15 and 25m above the ground. After 2.3 seconds, while the rockets were still firing, the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5m above the ground and fell to the ground. The rockets flew <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> with the backshell and parachute (they have since been sighted by orbital images). The lander impacted at 14m/s and limited the impact to only 18G of deceleration. The first bounce was 15.7m high and continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces (accelerometer data recording did not continue through all of the bounces).|$|E
500|$|As Universal anticipated, {{director}} Paul Leni turned Willard's {{play into}} an expressionist film suited to an American audience. Historian Bernard F. Dick observes that [...] "Leni reduced German expressionism, with its weird chiaroscuro, asymmetric sets, and excessive stylization, to a format compatible with American film practice." [...] Jenn Dlugos argues that [...] "many stage play movie adaptations [...] {{fall into the}} trap of looking like 'a stage play taped for the big screen' with minimal emphasis on the environment and plenty of stage play overacting." [...] This, however, was not the case for Leni's film. Richard Scheib notes that [...] "Leni's style is something that lifts The Cat and the Canary <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> from being merely a filmed stage play and gives it an amazing visual dynamism." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} Hollies, several artists covered [...] "If I Needed Someone" [...] {{soon after the}} Beatles {{recorded}} it. Stained Glass released the song as their first single – a version that Billboard magazine described as an [...] "impressive debut" [...] and [...] "an exciting off-beat ballad". Having struggled to maintain their relevance against British Invasion bands, the Kingsmen recorded the song with an arrangement that authors Stuart Shea and Robert Rodriguez recognise as [...] "a prototypically American response to British folk". This version failed to chart in the US when issued as a single and later appeared on the group's 1966 album <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Away.</b> Other artists who recorded it in 1966 include the Cryan' Shames, for their debut album, Sugar and Spice, and Hugh Masekela, whose version appeared on a single and on Hugh Masekela's Next Album.|$|E

500|$|In {{the bottom}} of the ninth, rookie pitcher Adam Wainwright – filling in as {{emergency}} closer – found himself in a two-out, bases-loaded situation against center fielder Carlos Beltrán, who had already homered three times in the NLCS. [...] Molina called for a mound conference. [...] Initially, he wanted a sinker from Wainwright but changed his mind because he suspected Wainwright would overthrow it and give Beltrán an easy pitch to hit. [...] Molina made an unconventional choice by calling for a changeup to start the sequence against Beltrán. [...] It was called for a strike. [...] Had Beltrán successfully got a base hit, the scheme may have caused tension for the third-year catcher with La Russa and pitching coach Dave Duncan because throwing a first-pitch changeup ran contrary to Duncan's teaching. [...] Molina then called for two curveballs. [...] Beltrán fouled off the first, but Wainwright struck him out looking at a [...] "bender that started <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> and bit hard to the low inside corner" [...] for the final out of the game. [...] The Cardinals' conquest of the NLCS gave them a return trip to the World Series after two years. [...] They proceeded to defeat the Detroit Tigers in five games, giving Molina his first championship ring. [...] His mask was turned in for display at the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1979 season, the Expos {{had earned}} a {{reputation}} for having one of the strongest player development systems in baseball; the team had stockpiled young talent throughout its roster including four starting pitchers below the age of 23, and was hailed as [...] "the team of the '80s". When Montreal hosted the 1982 Major League Baseball All-Star Game on July 13, 1982, Expos fans voted four of their own into the starting lineup: Carter, Dawson, Raines and Rogers, while Al Oliver was named as a reserve. [...] It was only the second time since 1969 that the host team had four starters. The National League claimed a 4–1 victory in front of 59,057 fans in the first All-Star Game held outside of the United States; Rogers was the winning pitcher. Baseball historian and author Jonah Keri argued in his book Up, <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Away</b> that [...] "no one at the stadium could know it then, but baseball in Montreal peaked that night at the Big O." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{perimeter}} rule {{first went}} into effect in January 1966 as a voluntary agreement by air carriers in order to get permission to use short-haul jets at National. The purpose was to assure that Dulles continued to serve the long haul domestic and international markets, and to limit traffic and noise at National. The FAA assumed that ground level noise would be reduced because planes would take off light on fuel and therefore be <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> quickly. The agreement limited flights to those that were no longer than [...] with 7 grandfathered exceptions. The spirit of the voluntary agreement was regularly violated as flights left National to an airport within the perimeter and then immediately took off again for a destination beyond it. Within a year there was a proposal to reduce the perimeter to 500 miles, but it was widely opposed and never implemented. Overcrowding at National was later managed by the 1969 High Density Rule, thereby removing one of the justifications for the perimeter agreement.|$|E

2500|$|Apart {{from the}} acts, {{the stars of}} the club were the patrons. Tender Trap patrons were {{generally}} regarded by the press of the day to be a cut above – articles often refer to their eccentric, period fashion sense and funky moves. The most loyal patrons were a group known as [...] "the Kids" [...] – the Captain, Tito, 'Tache, Glen, Peta, Ineke, Jodie, & Megan. Other colourful patrons included [...] "Lantern", the [...] "Dancing Partner", Mr. Tambourine Man, Quiet Dave, Disco Phil, and Bongo John. A teenage Hana Shimada, now a co-director of her own successful GoodGod Small Club in downtown Sydney, was a regular sight on the dance-floor. All club regulars were issued the prized [...] "Swingers" [...] membership cards. However, the door policy was deliberately inclusive – all types were welcome, young and old, straight and gay, the sophisticated, the sexy, and the downright spooky. Celebrities had to pay to get in – they included Leonardo DiCaprio, Princess Stephanie of Monaco, Russell Crow, Geoffrey Rush, numerous touring rockers such as Urge Overkill and Donovan Leitch. Only one celebrity was ever admitted free as a special guest – Lamonte McLemore, one of the founding members of the American popular music vocal group the 5th Dimension. Lamonte received star treatment, and was feted by young ladies at his own table. Lamonte smiled enigmatically as a room full of people danced wildly to the 5th Dimension hits, Up, <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Away,</b> and Puppet Man, 30 years after those records had first hit the charts. At its peak, and on long weekend holidays, the Tender Trap could be packed with 1200 patrons, the queue stretching down Darlinghurst Road, all in a building licensed to entertain 300. The crush added to the sense of wild occasion, but for those wanting a more laid-back experience, mid-winter Tender Trap was the place to be.|$|E
