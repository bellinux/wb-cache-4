40|$|After the {{implementation}} of the tax division system, the central appropriation of <b>special</b> <b>funds</b> remains, but there will be no further increase in the total amount of such funds. At the same time, the establishment of a transfer payment system {{at the core of the}} tax division system will add new contents to the central appropriation of <b>special</b> <b>funds.</b> In this respect, the amount of centrally appropriated <b>special</b> <b>funds</b> will increase at a more rapid pace, which requires more efficient management. However, if we only pay attention to the absolute amount of the funds, while neglecting the rational distribution and management of the funds, the central appropriation of <b>special</b> <b>funds</b> will lose its original meaning.

40|$|Abstract: The central <b>special</b> <b>fund</b> of {{environmental}} protection is the main channel for the central government to make financial input into the environmental protection in China, which {{plays an important role}} in leading the environmental investment of local finance, enterprises and society. Based on the current situation, the article analyzes the scope and emphases supported by various environment <b>special</b> <b>funds.</b> Results show that the <b>special</b> <b>fund</b> lacks the effective integration, tends to be emergency-oriented and needs effective supervision. In light of those problems, the paper probes how to optimize the environmental protection <b>special</b> <b>fund</b> in China and makes some recommendations, such as coordination among various government departments with regard to the use of <b>special</b> <b>funds,</b> establishing a performance-based payment mechanism, founding the state environmental protection investment company as well as strengthening the control of the capital flow, etc. Key words: environmental protection; special fund; optimum design; performance The Chinese government has paid high attention to environmental protection and made great efforts in improving investment policies for environmental protection.
