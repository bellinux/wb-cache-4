40|$|Aims Genetically {{influenced}} {{aspects of}} adolescent behaviour {{can play a}} role in alcohol <b>use</b> and peer affiliation. We explored the correlations between friends' alcohol <b>use</b> and adolescent own <b>use</b> with a genetically sensitive design. Design Genetic and environmental factors were estimated on adolescent reports of their friends' alcohol <b>use</b> and their own <b>use</b> and problem <b>use</b> of alcohol. The correlations between the genetic and environmental factors that influence friends' alcohol <b>use</b> and adolescent own alcohol <b>use</b> and problem <b>use</b> were also estimated. Participants A total of 862 twin pairs aged 11 – 17 years sampled from the UK population-based Cardiff Study of All Wales and North-west of England Twins (CaStANET). Measurements Data on adolescent own alcohol <b>use</b> and problem <b>use</b> and the alcohol <b>use</b> of their three best friends were obtained <b>using</b> self-report questionnaires. Findings A significant genetic influence was found on adolescent friends' alcohol <b>use</b> (about 30 %). Significant correlations of 0. 60 and 0. 70 were found between the genetic influences on friends' alcohol <b>use</b> and adolescents' own <b>use</b> and problem <b>use</b> of alcohol.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on the associations between licit drug <b>use</b> and marijuana <b>use</b> in adolescence and young adulthood. Very few studies, however, have examined cigarettes and alcohol as separate variables to assess whether {{there is a difference between}} these licit drugs and their relationships with marijuana <b>use,</b> and none have focused exclusively on these relationships <b>using</b> a nationally representative sample. The present study investigated the relationships between alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana <b>use</b> in adolescence and young adulthood <b>using</b> data from the 2002 and 2003 National Surveys on Drug <b>Use</b> and Health. This current study investigated: (1) whether the correlations between alcohol <b>use</b> and marijuana <b>use</b> differ from those between cigarette <b>use</b> and marijuana <b>use,</b> (2) whether each licit drug is a significant, independent predictor of marijuana <b>use</b> after controlling for a comparable measure of the other licit drug, and (3) whether these relationships differ depending on how 2 ̆ 2 <b>use</b> 2 ̆ 2 is operationally defined. This is the first known study that has assessed multiple levels and definitions of <b>use</b> of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana to determine if the licit drugs differ in their associations and predictive values of marijuana <b>use</b> <b>using</b> a nationally representative sample. Overall, cigarette <b>use</b> was a stronger predictor of marijuana <b>use</b> than was alcohol <b>use,</b> particularly when assessing more frequent and higher rates of use; however, it was found that the differences in predictive values of alcohol and cigarette <b>use</b> on marijuana <b>use</b> differed as a function of how <b>use</b> was defined. In addition, cigarette <b>use</b> was a stronger predictor of marijuana <b>use</b> than was smokeless tobacco <b>use,</b> providing evidence that the relationship between cigarettes and marijuana <b>use</b> may be due, in part, to similar modes of ingestion. The methodological and clinical implications of the findings are discussed. ...|$|R
