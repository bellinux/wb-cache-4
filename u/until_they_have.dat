5|$|General basic {{training}} (initial officer training) for Royal Navy officers {{takes place at}} the Britannia Royal Naval College. Training takes up to a year depending on specialisation; all midshipmen participate in at least the first two terms, which are 14weeks each. <b>Until</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> completed initial fleet training, both midshipmen and sub-lieutenants at Britannia Royal Naval College do not use their substantive ranks, but instead use the rank of officer cadet.|$|E

5|$|In July 2007, Tecmo {{released}} a demo {{and a new}} game mode, Survival Mode, for Sigma over the PlayStation Network. The demo limits players to {{the first chapter of}} the game, but lets them play as Rachel in a separate mission. Survival Mode comprises missions in which players keep fighting <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> either killed all their opponents, or their character has been defeated.|$|E
5|$|The {{minimum age}} is 16 (after {{the end of}} GCSEs), {{although}} soldiers under 18 may not serve in operations. The maximum recruitment age was raised in January 2007 from 26 to 33years, and the maximum age for Army Reserve soldiers is higher. A soldier would traditionally enlist for a term of 22 years, although recently {{there has been a}} shift towards 12-year terms with a 22-year option. A soldier is not normally permitted to leave <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> served for at least four years, and must give 12 months' notice.|$|E
5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, the sacraments {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ {{is present in the}} Eucharist, those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating {{for at least an hour}} before receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{song of the}} American {{goldfinch}} is {{a series}} of musical warbles and twitters, often with a long note. A tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit call is often given in flight; it may also be described as per-chic-o-ree. While the female incubates the eggs, she calls to her returning mate with a soft continuous teeteeteeteete sound. The young begin to use a call of chick-kee or chick-wee shortly before fledging, which they use <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> left the nest entirely. There are two defense calls made by adults during nesting; a sweeet call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract predators, and a bearbee used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them and get them to crouch down in the nest to become less conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|The two men later reach {{a nature}} reserve {{as the third}} killer shows up. The trio meet their wives, their kids and Kwai's {{syndicate}} during a barbecue. After a tense standoff, they explain that they killed Costello's grandchildren because the children had seen their faces. Not wanting to start a shootout {{in front of the}} three attackers' wives and children, everyone waits <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> left. A moonlit gun battle ensues, with both sides suffering injuries. The three attackers flee, while Costello and Kwai's syndicate take refuge at a run-down apartment in Hong Kong to treat their wounds. Costello reveals that he is a former assassin and has had a bullet in his head for twenty years, which is affecting his memory.|$|E
5|$|When Maximus {{eventually}} {{catches up}} with Rapunzel, Flynn and Pascal, the horse attempts to apprehend Flynn only to be charmed by Rapunzel, who convinces him to leave Flynn alone <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> arrived at their destination while Pascal ensures that the two maintain a healthy relationship. In the kingdom, Flynn, Rapunzel and Pascal embark on a canoe ride to see the floating lights, revealed to be lanterns, up-close, while Maximus is forced to wait ashore as {{there is not enough}} room for him. In a friendly gesture, Flynn gives him a bag of apples. Realizing that he is falling in love with Rapunzel, Flynn attempts to hand off the crown he was promised to the Stabbington Brothers, two colleagues of his, only to be kidnapped and handed over to the police. Mistaking this for abandonment, Rapunzel is taken back to the tower by Gothel, who has caught up with them.|$|E

5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey seals. The harbour seals have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> lost their first white coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour seals off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a ducted propeller.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations with malicious intent could send {{information that could}} enable human civilization to destroy itself, such as powerful computer viruses or {{information on how to}} make extremely potent weapons that humans would not yet be able to use responsibly. While the motives for such an action are unknown, it would require minimal energy use {{on the part of the}} extraterrestrials. According to Musso, however, computer viruses in particular will be nearly impossible unless extraterrestrials possess detailed knowledge of human computer architectures, which would only happen if a human message sent to the stars were protected with little thought to security. Even a virtual machine on which extraterrestrials could run computer programs could be designed specifically for the purpose, bearing little relation to computer systems commonly used on Earth. In addition, humans could send messages to extraterrestrials detailing that they do not want access to the Encyclopædia Galactica <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> reached a suitable level of technological advancement, thus mitigating harmful impacts of extraterrestrial technology.|$|E
5|$|When players {{encounter}} {{enemies in}} either scripted events or random encounters, they enter a battle mode. During battles, players control a small heart which represents their soul, and must avoid attacks unleashed by the opposing monster {{in a similar}} fashion to a bullet hell shooter. As the game progresses, new elements are introduced, such as colored obstacles, and boss battles which change the way players control the heart. Players may choose to attack the enemy, which involves timed button presses. Killing enemies will cause the player to earn EXP (in turn increasing their LOVE) and gold. They can use the ACT option to perform various actions, which vary depending on the enemy. If the player uses the right actions to respond to the enemy, or attacks them <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> low HP (but still alive) they can choose to spare them and end the fight without killing them. In order for some boss encounters to be completed peacefully, the player is required to survive until the character they are facing has finished their dialogue. The game features multiple story branches and endings depending on whether players choose to kill or spare their enemies; and as such, it is possible to clear the game without killing a single enemy.|$|E
