5|$|RNA {{interference}} is {{an important}} innate defence against viruses. Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces. A biochemical pathway – the RISC complex, is activated, which ensures cell survival by degrading the viral mRNA. Rotaviruses have evolved to avoid this defence mechanism by not <b>uncoating</b> fully inside the cell, and releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner capsid. Their genomic dsRNA remains protected inside {{the core of the}} virion.|$|E

25|$|Once {{inside the}} host cell, the virus {{must find a}} way to uncoat. The virus {{particles}} enter the cell in a structure known as an endosome (also called an endolysosome).

This removal allows membrane-penetration mediator μ1 to be exposed and attachment protein σ1 goes through a conformational change. After <b>uncoating</b> is completed, the active virus is released in the cytoplasm where replication of the genome and virion takes place.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the resistance to rolling contact fatigue of a-C:H:W and MoS 2 /Ti coated gears. The investigation of rolling contact fatigue was realised by means of a gear test rig using FZG PT C/ 10 / 90 pitting test. Four material combinations of gears were tested: wheel and pinion <b>uncoated,</b> wheel and pinion coated, wheel coated and pinion <b>uncoated</b> as well as wheel <b>uncoated</b> and pinion coated. The tests were performed using for lubrication mineral gear oil of API GL- 5 performance level and 80 W/ 90 viscosity grade. The results indicate that for the coated/coated pair (wheel and pinion coated) and uncoated/coated pair (<b>uncoated</b> wheel and coated pinion) a significant decrease in the fatigue life compared to the <b>uncoated</b> gears was obtained. The best results were obtained in the case of the coated/uncoated pair (a-C:H:W coated wheel and <b>uncoated</b> pinion) – even fourfold increase in the fatigue life was observed.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the revision rate for aseptic loosening of the <b>uncoated</b> and cemented Interax tibial components. 3 studies were included, involving 349 Interax total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) for the comparison of <b>uncoated</b> and cemented fixation.

25|$|The primary {{objective}} of HCV therapy is permanent eradication of the virus. The secondary potential benefit of eradication is {{a reduction in}} the risk of liver failure and liver cancer. Currently, peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin is the only FDA approved treatment for HIV–HCV co-infected patients. Interferons bind to specific cell surface receptors of virus-infected cells, which induces a complex cascade of protein-protein interactions and a rapid activation of gene transcription. The antiviral effects of interferons are mediated through inhibition of viral penetration or <b>uncoating,</b> inhibiting viral replication or translation of viral proteins, and/or viral assembly and release. The difference between peginterferon and interferon is the addition of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer. The addition of PEG decreases plasma clearance considerably, protects the molecule from proteolytic degradation and reduces its immunogenicity. Peak concentrations are approximately 1.5-2 fold higher than trough concentrations and the half-life is 80 hours (compared to 5.1 hours for interferon alpha-2a). Ribavirin is a synthetic nucleoside analogue, but its mechanism of action is not clearly established. Ribavirin inhibits the replication {{of a wide range of}} RNA and DNA viruses. Pharmacokinetics are similar in patients with HIV co-infection compared with HCV mono-infection.|$|E

2500|$|The two outer capsid proteins, VP2 and VP5, mediate {{attachment}} and penetration of BTV into the target cell. [...] The virus makes initial {{contact with the}} cell with VP2, triggering receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virus. [...] The low pH within the endosome then triggers BTV's membrane penetration protein VP5 to undergo a conformational change that disrupts the endosomal membrane. [...] <b>Uncoating</b> yields a transcriptionally active 470S core particle which is composed of two major proteins VP7 and VP3, and the three minor proteins VP1, VP4 and VP6 {{in addition to the}} dsRNA genome. There is no evidence that any trace of the outer capsid remains associated with these cores, as has been described for reovirus. The cores may be further uncoated to form 390S subcore particles that lack VP7, also in contrast to reovirus. Subviral particles are probably akin to cores derived in vitro from virions by physical or proteolytic treatments that remove the outer capsid and causes activation of the BTV transcriptase. In addition to the seven structural proteins, three non-structural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2, NS3 (and a related NS3A) are synthesised in BTV-infected cells. Of these, NS3/NS3A is involved in the egress of the progeny virus. The two remaining non-structural proteins, NS1 and NS2, are produced at high levels in the cytoplasm and are believed to be involved in virus replication, assembly and morphogenesis.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to a stable fixator construct, stable pin fixation is needed to prevent the vicious cycle of pin loosening, pin site infection and further loosening [15]. Moroni et al. [16] found that deterioration of bone–pin interface strength was an inevitable phenomenon with standard, <b>uncoated</b> pins. This was due to fibrous tissue formation at the bone–pin interface of <b>uncoated</b> pins, which led to loosening [17, 18]; this was recorded as a lower extraction torque force needed during pin extraction than was the insertion torque [9]. In contrast, hydroxyapatite-coated pins show improved fixation strength, with extraction torque forces being higher than the initial insertion torque forces and 90 times higher than standard <b>uncoated</b> pins [9]. This improved fixation translated into significantly lower rates of osteolysis; an 18 times lower incidence of pin loosening [9] {{and a decrease in}} pin site infection when compared to <b>uncoated</b> pins [11, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25].

40|$|After clathrin-mediated endocytosis, clathrin removal yields an <b>uncoated</b> vesicle {{population}} {{primed for}} fusion {{with the early}} endosome. Here we present the first characterization of <b>uncoated</b> vesicles and show that myo 6, an unconventional myosin, functions to move these vesicles out of actin-rich regions found in epithelial cells. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that myo 6 -associated <b>uncoated</b> vesicles were motile and exhibited fusion and stretching events before endosome delivery, processes that were dependent on myo 6 motor activity. In the absence of myo 6 motor activity, <b>uncoated</b> vesicles remained trapped in the actin mesh, where they exhibited Brownian-like motion. Exit from the actin mesh occurred by a slow diffusion-based mechanism, delaying transferrin trafficking to the early endosome. Expression of a myo 6 mutant that bound tightly to F-actin produced immobilized vesicles and blocked trafficking. Depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton rescued this block and specifically accelerated transferrin delivery to the early endosome without affecting earlier steps in endocytosis. Therefore actin is a physical barrier impeding <b>uncoated</b> vesicle trafficking, and myo 6 is recruited to move the vesicles through this barrier for fusion with the early endosome...|$|R
