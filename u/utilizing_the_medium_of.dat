Music {{is said to be a}} multidimensional art form <b>utilizing</b> <b>the</b> <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> sound, and because of this multidimensional nature studies of music are easily confounded. In this thesis, an experiment has been constructed to investigate the effect from speed of music on prototyping. Our hypothesis is that music with a higher BPM will result in a higher activity and/or better results during a prototyping session. The experiment was constructed by analysing available literature and other information to find suitable ways to measure the effect from music, as well as how to develop the music and test setup in order to avoid unnecessary confounding. The chosen means of measurement was quantitative measurements and movement of the test subjects. During two weeks in June/ July 2015 the experiment performed with summer school children at the science museum Heureka in Finland. With the data gathered, it was not possible to confirm our hypothesis, but because of some elements, such as the age of the children and location of the experiment it cannot be discarded it either. The experiment should therefore be retried at a later and more suitable time, with people in an older age group and at a more controlled locatio...|$|E

40|$|Mingei” is a {{word that}} was first coined by Yanagi Muneyoshi (1889 - 1961) and his {{associates}} in the 1920 's. Since then the Mingei movement developed two objectives: one is to promote the idea that hand craft objects are seen as beautiful artworks in and of themselves and deemphasizing the concept of authorship; the other is to realize Yanagi’s theory in practice. This report focuses on the reception and practice of Yanagi’s theory by Tonomura Kichinosuke (1898 - 1993), who participated in the movement from the early period up to the 1960 s, when Mingei began to gain popularity. Tonomura played a seminal role in refining the theories behind Mingei and promoting Mingei as a folk crafts movement, as Yanagi conceived it. Tonomura’s involvement to the Mingei movement as follows: First, his struggle with individualism led him to accept the principles of the Mingei movement. Then, he <b>utilized</b> <b>the</b> <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> weaving in order to practice Yanagi’s theory. Finally, he helped develop and refine the movement as an educator known for his criticisms against the “Mingei Boom” of the 1960 s. Tonomura was fundamental in the promotion and realization of the Mingei movement; his main achievement is his work in defining and defending Yanagi’s Mingei theory. That said, his attitude restricts the flexibility of Mingei theory and the development of new interpretations...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 71 - 73) Several {{concerns were}} identified regarding {{the need to}} raise the visibility of health education services within the Southeast Health Services Region of Los Angeles County. Many of these problems {{could be attributed to}} the absence of an effective methodology for communicating information regarding the scope of health education activities and services conducted. Therefore, {{the primary purpose of the}} project was to <b>utilize</b> <b>the</b> <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> video for reporting health education activities. In order to implement this project, the development of a well-planned report depicting the activities of the health education unit was required. An audio script was prepared which utilized health education unit performance data at the Compton Health Center. The video report was then viewed by a diverse mix of public health professionals. A questionnaire was developed and pre-tested to evaluate the overall effectiveness of video as a mechanism for reporting. Thirty health professionals who earlier viewed the report evaluated several dimensions of the production. Respondents represented eight disciplines from two public health centers in the Southeast Health Services Region. The aggregate of Respondents provided validation for the methology. Thus, the project demonstrated: 1. Video can be used as an effective tool for portraying health education activities and services. 2. There is further need to investigate and experiment with video as a supplementary reporting mechanism. 3. Video can be a beneficial adjunct in: (a) Orienting new staff to the district. (b) Summarizing and presenting district health education services and activities. (c) Demonstrating year to year assessment of changes in health district and health region activities as well as identifying gaps in services and new needs. (d) Summarization and presentation to administration and staff of the annual scope of the health district and health region, services provided, etc. 4.

40|$|Digital {{information}} sharing {{is vital to}} improve efficiency in rescue and emergency operations. In the absence of infrastructure, the devices brought into the area by rescue personnel, {{might be used to}} set up a mobile ad-hoc network. This application domain is dominated by frequent merges and departures of nodes, resulting in an unstable and ever changing topology. Information sharing can be handled by using metadata describing instances of tables in the network. We disseminate metadata to all nodes, so that each has its own local structure containting all metadata available. The structure enables nodes to search for table replicas, and query these over delay tolerant paths. Since metadata is small in size the structure will remain small even with many tables existing, and storing it on every device is feasible. The characteristics of mobile ad-hoc networks makes the task of disseminating metadata across all nodes difficult, in particular in the presence of scarce resources. We have looked into research coming from the domain of ad-hoc networks to reuse techniques applicable to {{information sharing}}. The techniques come mainly from routing in delay-tolerant networks, and routing protocols of dense networks. We have implemented three protocols which use different approaches to information sharing. The simple protocol uses a basic epidemic routing approach, propagating information from neighbor to neighbor. By using the broadcast protocol, we <b>utilize</b> <b>the</b> shared <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> wireless communication and its ability to send messages from one to many nodes, in addition to letting each node stop the synchronization if no metadata is needed, thus removing some of the redundant propagation paths. <b>The</b> semantic protocol <b>utilizes</b> <b>the</b> concept of groups amongst the nodes, by giving these first priority. If nodes of the same group are spread out through the network they will serve as multiple starting points for the following normal dissemination. By taking part in the implementation of the MIDAS middleware, real life scenarios have been acquired, and tested using the protocols developed in this thesis. MIDAS is a large reasearch project aiming to produce a middleware that speeds up MANET application development. By testing the implemented protocols in NEMAN, an emulator environment, we have measured both bandwidth usage and performance. The implemented broadcast protocol is measured to use 50 times less bandwidth than the simple implementation. Further the concept of groups of nodes is utilized to give certain nodes higher priority in the dissemination process, which results in multiple starting points for the normal dissemination techniques. This protocol has only shown that the group priority is working, however {{more research is needed to}} verify that the multiple starting points give an advantage to the global dissemination. As we can see from the results and the techniques used, routing principles in mobile ad-hoc networks can easily be applied to information sharing showing good performance optimization, resulting in fast dissemination and high availability of metadata information amoung the rescue personnel's devices...|$|R
