5|$|In 1955, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin {{detected}} {{bursts of}} radio signals coming from Jupiter at 22.2MHz. The period of these bursts matched {{the rotation of}} the planet, and they were also able to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>information</b> to refine the rotation rate. Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-bursts) that had a duration of less than a hundredth of a second.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the work carried out by {{accountants}} and auditors requires a high level of ethics. Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>information</b> to make an informed decision about investment. They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as the auditors that verified it, to present a true and fair view of the company. Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas, allowing for the right choice that, although it may not benefit the company, will benefit the public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{occurs during}} the winter months. Once a female quoll has been impregnated, the folds on her abdomen convert into a pouch that opens at the back. The {{gestation}} period is 21 days. A baby quoll, or pup, {{is the size of}} a grain of rice. Up to 18 quolls are born in each litter, but only six survive the first two weeks. The survivors stay in their mother's pouch for eight weeks, suckling on one of the mother's six teats for milk. During the ninth week, the pups venture out of the pouch and onto the mother's back, where they remain for six weeks. Quolls reaches maturity when they are one year old, and have a natural lifespan of between two and five years. A 2008 study of the pouches of tiger quolls reported the pouches' appearance' were reliable indicators of the quolls' reproductive status: during the follicular phase, pouches were found to be red and have many secretions. After ovulation, pouches became deep and wet. Researchers can <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>information</b> to determine where a female quoll is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.|$|E

5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>information</b> to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E

25|$|Males of P. clarus {{can detect}} females' size and age based on pheromones and other {{chemicals}} left in females' silk, and males <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>information</b> to choose mates.

25|$|Speech {{perception}} {{is the process}} by which the sounds of language are heard, interpreted and understood. The study of speech {{perception is}} closely linked to the fields of phonology and phonetics in linguistics and cognitive psychology and perception in psychology. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how human listeners recognize speech sounds and <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>information</b> to understand spoken language. Speech perception research has applications in building computer systems that can recognize speech, in improving speech recognition for hearing- and language-impaired listeners, and in foreign-language teaching.|$|E

25|$|The Finapres {{methodology}} {{was developed}} to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>information</b> to calculate arterial pressure from finger cuff pressure data. A generalised algorithm to correct for the pressure level difference between the finger and brachial sites in patients was developed. This correction worked under all of the circumstances it was tested in—even when it was not designed for it—because it applied general physiological principles. This innovative brachial pressure waveform reconstruction method was first implemented in the Finometer, the successor of Finapres that BMI-TNO introduced to the market in 2000.|$|E

Students and school level data are also provided to the appropriate school system on the understanding that they can be used to target specific supports and resources to schools that need them most.

Video recorders can <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>information</b> (instead of a simple timer) in order to automatically record a scheduled programme, even if the broadcast time changes after the user programmes the VCR.
