5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the <b>US</b> <b>during</b> 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{attended}} the summer workshop at the San Francisco Ballet School in 1998. She and Bradley selected the workshop over offers from the Joffrey Ballet, ABT and Dance Theater of Harlem, among others.

San Francisco Ballet, ABT and New York City Ballet are regarded as the three preeminent classical ballet companies in the <b>US.</b> <b>During</b> the six-week workshop at San Francisco, Copeland {{was placed in the}} most advanced classes and was under a full tuition plus expenses scholarship. At the end of the workshop, she received one of the few offers to continue as a full-time student at the school. She declined the offer because of the encouragement from her mother to return home, the prospect of continuing personal training from the Bradley family and dreams of a subsequent summer with ABT.|$|E

5|$|Job Maarse, artistic {{director}} of Pentatone, said of the album's origins: From day one the co-operation between Pentatone and the Oregon Symphony and its Music Director Carlos Kalmar has been something magical. The quality of the orchestra and the program ideas of Carlos Kalmar {{attracted the attention of}} a large group of music lovers in and outside the <b>U.S.</b> <b>During</b> a pleasant meeting at the Chicago airport almost two years ago the idea for this new album was discussed. I believe all at the table liked it and now everybody can hear how these three pieces, although by composers with different styles, fit perfectly in one program.

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{squall line}} that {{developed}} from near Dallas to Kansas City moved eastward throughout the late evening and overnight hours causing numerous reports of damaging wind {{along with many}} spin-up tornadoes from Louisiana to Ohio and Indiana. It then moved through the southeast <b>U.S.</b> <b>during</b> the early morning hours. Additional strong thunderstorms developed ahead of the front across the southeast during the overnight and early morning hours. A record (at the time) of five tornado emergency declarations were issued on February 5; four for Tennessee, and one in Alabama.|$|E

Its success also served as a career breakthrough for LL Cool J and Rick Rubin.

5|$|Taller, heavier {{buildings}} such as skyscrapers {{also required}} stronger foundations than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble, {{which was in}} turn laid down on the soft top layer of the ground called the overburden. As buildings became taller and heavier, the overburden could not support their weight, and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below. In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through soft soil and often below the water table, risking the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete. The deeper the foundations needed to be, the greater the challenge. Special water-tight boxes called caissons were invented {{to deal with this}} problem in England in 1830 and adopted in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>during</b> the 1850s and 1860s.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to the {{decision}} of Potawatomi leaders to aid the <b>U.S.</b> <b>during</b> the war, American officials did not seize tribal land as war reparations. Instead, only three individuals accused of leading the Indian Creek massacre were tried in court; they were acquitted. Nevertheless, the drive to purchase Potawatomi land west of the Mississippi began in October 1832, when commissioners in Indiana bought {{a large amount of}} Potawatomi land, even though not all Potawatomi bands were represented at the treaty. The tribe was compelled to sell their remaining land west of the Mississippi in a treaty held in Chicago in September 1833.|$|E
