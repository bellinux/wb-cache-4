Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) {{represent}} {{very likely}} “the ” most extensive computational, theoretical and observational effort ever carried out successfully in physics and astrophysics. The extensive campaign of observation from space based X-ray and γ-ray observatory, {{such as the}} Vela, CGRO, BeppoSAX, HETE-II, INTEGRAL, Swift, R-XTE, Chandra, XMM satellites, have been matched by complementary observations in the radio wavelength (e. g. by the VLA) and in the optical band (e. g. by VLT, Keck, ROSAT). The net result is unprecedented accuracy in the received data allowing {{the determination of the}} energetics, the time variability and the spectral properties of these GRB sources. The very fortunate situation occurs that these data can be confronted with a mature theoretical development.

The quantum automaton is the minimal-assumption extension to the Planck and ultrarelativistic scales of quantum field theory.

The automaton theory is a very promising framework for quantum gravity, since it is quantum ab-initio, with relativistic covariance as emergent and not assumed a priori, it is free from all the problems arising from the continuum, it doesn't suffer violations of causality, and has no divergences. It is the natural scenario to accommodate the quantum holographic principle.

Whereas most previous studies focused on relativistic reconnection in pair plasmas, less {{attention has been}} paid to electron-ion plasma reconnection, expected in black hole accretion flows and relativistic jets. We report a comprehensive particle-in-cell numerical investigation of reconnection in an electron-ion plasma, spanning a wide range of ambient ion magnetizations σ_i, from the semirelativistic <b>regime</b> (<b>ultrarelativistic</b> electrons but nonrelativistic ions, 0. 001 > 1). We investigate how the reconnection rate, electron and ion plasma flows, electric and magnetic field structures, electron/ion energy partitioning, and nonthermal particle acceleration depend on σ_i. Our key findings are: (1) the reconnection rate is about 0. 1 of the Alfvenic rate across all regimes; (2) electrons can form concentrated moderately relativistic outflows even in the semirelativistic, small-σ_i regime; (3) while the released magnetic energy is partitioned equally between electrons and ions in the ultrarelativistic limit, the electron energy fraction declines gradually with decreased σ_i and asymptotes to about 0. 25 in the semirelativistic regime; (4) reconnection leads to efficient nonthermal electron acceleration with a σ_i-dependent power-law index, p(σ_i) ≃ const+ 0. 7 σ_i^- 1 / 2. These findings are important for understanding black hole systems and lend support to semirelativistic reconnection models for powering nonthermal emission in blazar jets, offering a natural explanation for the spectral indices observed in these systems.

Therefore, we examine the nonminimal interaction through the gravimagnetic moment κ and show that the theory with κ= 1 is free of the problems detected in MPTD equations. Hence, the nonminimally interacting theory seems a more promising candidate for description of a relativistic rotating body in general relativity. Vector model in an arbitrary electromagnetic field leads to generalized Frenkel and BMT equations.

40|$|The {{production}} rate of right-handed neutrinos from a Standard Model plasma at a temperature above a hundred GeV is evaluated up to NLO in Standard Model couplings. The results apply {{in the so-called}} relativistic regime, referring parametrically to a mass M ~ pi T, generalizing thereby previous NLO results which only apply in the non-relativistic regime M >> pi T. The non-relativistic expansion is observed to converge for M > 15 T, but the smallness of any loop corrections allows it {{to be used in}} practice already for M > 4 T. In the latter regime any non-covariant dependence of the differential rate on the spatial momentum is shown to be mild. The loop expansion breaks down in the <b>ultrarelativistic</b> <b>regime</b> M << pi T, but after a simple mass resummation it nevertheless extrapolates reasonably well towards a result obtained previously through complete LPM resummation, apparently confirming a strong enhancement of the rate at high temperatures (which facilitates chemical equilibration).
