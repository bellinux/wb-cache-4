40|$|This paper {{reflects}} {{the results of}} a study, the main objective of which was to investigate the practical treatment of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees in Ghana and South Africa, and to explore whether such treatment is in accordance with existing international norms and standards for the protection of refugee children. The study focused on the realisation of children's socio-economic rights in order to measure treatment. The paper seeks to address the obstacles which prevent the proper treatment of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees, and to make recommendations as to how the international community can better regulate the treatment of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees. In essence, this paper aims to investigate whether there is a discrepancy between the rights of child refugees acknowledged in international law, and the situation of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees in practice and, if so, how this can be remedied. The paper seeks to show, through the case studies of Ghana and South Africa, that <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> refugees are, to a certain extent, lost in the system...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis outlines {{some background}} context regarding {{the phenomenon of}} <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> in Czech Republic. Czech Republic belongs {{to the group of}} transit countries, through which <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> travel to reach their destination country. The consequence is very few asylum applications from minors which Czech Republic receives. Therefore the thesis offers a broader view of migration issue of minors taking into account the European context. The Facility for children of foreign nationals provides care to <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> in Czech Republic. This Facility {{plays a key role in}} process of integration of minors into the majority society. Thus the thesis as a form of qualitative approach to the issue focuses on the understanding of the function of this Facility and on the role of social and cultural capital of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> in the process of their integration in Czech Republic.

40|$|Irregular {{migration}} by <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> {{has become}} an increasingly prevalent global issue. <b>Unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> who have fled their countries of origin, often due to persecution, violence, or poverty, present an opportunity for migrant smugglers and human traffickers who exploit their unique vulnerabilities and dependence. Smuggling and trafficking are often fluid, interrelated phenomena, making practical distinctions difficult. This article explores the protection of smuggled and trafficked <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> under the United Nations Protocols against the Smuggling of Migrants and Trafficking in Persons. While each Protocol includes mandatory provisions pertaining to criminalization, it explains that neither Protocol adequately protects <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors,</b> addresses their unique vulnerabilities, or accounts for the often-blurred distinction between minors who are smuggled migrants and minors who are victims of trafficking. In light of these issues, this article argues that a coherent, protection-based approach, founded on international human rights and refugee law, is necessary. This article outlines rights and principles integral to such an approach, and analyses their particular application to smuggled and trafficked <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors.</b> It posits that the emphasis on criminal, preventative, and border control aspects of smuggling and trafficking comes {{at the expense of}} more nuanced understandings of the experiences and vulnerabilities of smuggled and trafficked <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors,</b> despite the pressing and evident need for a more substantive framework for their protection...|$|R

40|$|The {{legal rights}} of {{children}} who enter a country without their parents or other guardians, {{including the right to}} legal representation in immigration proceedings, differ vastly across the globe. This Article is the first to show that <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> lie at the nexus of international and regional human rights standards governing the treatment of immigrants, children, and civil counsel and to show how the development of human rights standards in these three areas underscores the importance of and the need for counsel for <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors.</b> Part I illustrates why <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> in the United States need legal representation by focusing on the complexity of immigration proceedings, the likelihood that children will be deprived of their liberty {{at some point in the}} process, and the law and practice relating to representation. Part II analyzes how developing regional and international legal standards for children’s rights, refugee rights, and the right to free civil counsel support the right to free legal counsel for unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings. Part III identifies the differing approaches to legal representation for <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> around the world, and Part IV endorses a model for representation for <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> based on developing human rights law as well as best practices and ethical standards in the United States. The Article concludes that the recommended model should be at the forefront of U.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} research examines how service provisions affect lives of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> in Canada. In this study I utilized a semi-structured individual interview method.

The unaccompanied children that I interviewed had mixed experiences. Social and legal supports were made available {{to some of them}} while one was deported. This paper employs Bhabha’s postcolonial perspective and Foucault’s governmentality to illustrate unaccompanied minors’ post-arrival situation in Canada. This paper also attempts to look at children’s rights from Hanson and Nieuwenhuys’s (2013) perspective of living rights, social justice and translations. This paper explores how the change in recent immigration law affects the lives of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors.</b> Findings {{of this study suggest that}} it is important to have a consensus on the definition of an unaccompanied minor; improved data collection and record-keeping on the number of unaccompanied minors; and, having a government-approved follow up mechanism. The study recommends policy makers, service providers and scholars pay increased attention to the experiences of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> to ensure that adequate social and legal services are offered to an <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> in Canada...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} a qualitative study that explored the sexual health needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> in the London Boroughs of Enfield and Haringey. It begins {{by providing the}} policy context and outlining {{the rationale for the}} research undertaken. Although there is a growing body of literature and research available on refugees and asylum-seekers, less is known about the health needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors.</b> This is especially true of sexual health. The introductory section to the report shows how this case study of an exploration of the nature and level of sexual and reproductive health needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> in Enfield and Haringey can provide important new information that can help policy development and implementation in this area at both a local and national level. The background section also explains the qualitative research methods used by the research team. The research findings are then presented in five sections that address research objectives one and two: firstly, exploring the nature and level of sexual and reproductive health needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> in Enfield and Haringey; secondly, assessing the accessibility and appropriateness of current sexual health, family planning and young peoples’ service provision in meeting the identified needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors.</b> Section one covers the background characteristics of the <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> involved in the study, such as age, gender, country of origin, length of time in the UK and the countries of origin. This section shows the diversity of the sample. Following this, in section two, it is shown that although those young people interviewed all have their own individual stories, there are common themes to these experiences. These common themes relate to their accounts of leaving their home country, travelling to the UK and establishing themselves in Enfield and Haringey. Sections three, four and five explore the findings generated from the two sets of interviews: with the <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors,</b> and with the professionals. Sexual health needs cannot be seen in isolation, so section three looks at the social care needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> and their likely sources of support. These issues are important because they give some indication of where, and how, sexual health needs might be addressed. Section four then moves on to consider general health needs, before section five focuses upon sexual health. The report ends with a conclusion and recommendations, thus addressing the final research objective: identifying how local health promoting programmes and local sexual health services can develop and deliver appropriate interventions to meet the sexual and reproductive health needs of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors...</b>|$|R

40|$|THESIS 8274 This PhD study {{explores the}} {{experiences}} of asylum-seeking teenagers who have arrived in Ireland unaccompanied by parents or guardians (<b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors).</b> The arrival {{of these young people}} is a very recent phenomenon in the Irish context, beginning only in the mid- 1990 s, and reflects a change from an overall pattern of emigration from Ireland to a new pattern of immigration into the country. To date, relatively little research has been conducted in relation to the lives of these immigrants, including asylum seekers generally and <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> specifically. The literature that has emerged - both nationally and internationally - has often neglected the ?ordinary? lives of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> prior to their departure from home. In addition, in discussions of the losses and changes that these young people encounter, their own individual perspectives have often been disregarded. This has resulted in a lack of knowledge of how <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> cope with their circumstances and a tendency to portray these young people as victims who are struggling with their traumatic circumstances...|$|R

40|$|<b>Unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> are {{children}} under the age of 18 who do not have their parents or legal guardian present at the time they make a refugee protection claim in Canada. like adult refugee claimants, <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> seeking asylum in Canada have to prove both subjective and objective fear for the well-founded fear to be accorded Convention refugee status under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). However, a child refugee claimant may not be able to express subjective fear of persecution in the same manner as an adult refugee claimant. Inference of lack of subjective fear that can be drawn from the pre-application conduct of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> could lead to negative refugee determination. <b>Unaccompanied</b> <b>minors,</b> being not able to establish their subjective fear, though there may be objective evidence of a risk of persecution, may face denial of refugee protection. They require special consideration in their asylum claim, not only for procedural questions but also for substantive issues. My objective is to demonstrate that the requirement of subjective fear for the well-founded fear in section 96 of the IRPA has to be eliminated in the case of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors.</b> This will be met by showing that unaccompanied minors' right to equality under section 15 of the Canadian Charter is violated by requiring them to prove both their subjective fear and objective fear, and that this violation is not reasonable and not demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society under section 1 of the Charter. Moreover, the need for <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> to prove objective fear alone for their well-founded fear will be justified philosophically with the principle of the best interests of the child and the legal theory of Ronald Dworkin...|$|R
