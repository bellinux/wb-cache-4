40|$|Emedded {{nondestructive}} evaluation (NDE) is an emerging {{technology that will}} allow for the transitioning from conventional ultrasonic methods to embedded systems for structural health monitoring (SHM), such as those envisaged for the Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM). Structural health monitoring for IVHM requires the development of small, lightweight, inexpensive systems to be embedded in the airframe with minimum weight penalty and at affordable costs. For non-destructive evaluation, PWASs {{can be used as}} both active and passive probes. The main advantage of PWASs over conventional <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>probes</b> lies in their small size, light weight, low profile, and low cost.

50|$|An {{ultrasonic}} horn (also {{known as}} acoustic horn, sonotrode, acoustic waveguide, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>probe)</b> is a tapering metal bar commonly used for augmenting the oscillation displacement amplitude provided by an ultrasonic transducer operating {{at the low}} end of the ultrasonic frequency spectrum (commonly between 15 and 100 kHz). The device is necessary because the amplitudes provided by the transducers themselves are insufficient for most practical applications of power ultrasound. Another function of the ultrasonic horn is to efficiently transfer the acoustic energy from the ultrasonic transducer into the treated media, which may be solid (for example, in ultrasonic welding, ultrasonic cutting or ultrasonic soldering) or liquid (for example, in ultrasonic homogenization, sonochemistry, milling, emulsification, spraying or cell disruption). Ultrasonic processing of liquids relies of intense shear forces and extreme local conditions (temperatures up to 5000 K and pressures up to 1000 atm) generated by acoustic cavitation.|$|E
