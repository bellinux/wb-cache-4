40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. Despite the {{strong support for}} exergy in thermodynamics, the {{industry}} still relies on energy based power plant efficiencies. The paper exposes errors with energy based efficiencies and improves the graphical representation of plants efficiencies. Among others, energy efficiencies cannot recognised that Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant may be less efficient than condensing plants or that fossil fuel based plants should always be more efficient than any biomass plants because irreversibilities from biomass spontaneous thermo-chemical reactions are much higher than with coal or natural gas. Profitability equations fail to distinguish the true technical efficiency so exergy must be used, if only to enhance power plants understanding. Two novel graphs are introduced. Graph # 1 combines all in a single graph; total, electrical and thermal exergy efficiencies. Graph # 2 splits thermal exergy efficiency into two components related to; plant thermal losses and <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> quality. Data from 24 existing and design plants is used to support the graphs. Graph # 1 shows different rankings of efficiencies than what is typically understood by the industry. Graph # 2 shows that achieving further higher thermal energy efficiency barely increases the total exergy efficiency. If possible, {{it is better to}} increase the <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> quality...|$|E

40|$|Combined {{heat and}} power (CHP) is a {{promising}} technological configuration for reducing energy consumption and increasing energy {{security in the}} domestic built environment. Fuel cells, on account of their: high electrical efficiency, low emissions and <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> {{have been identified as}} a key technological option for improving both building energy efficiency and reducing emissions in domestic CHP applications. The work presented in this paper builds upon results currently reported in the literature of fuel cells operating in domestic building applications, with an emission and economic performance assessment of a real, commercially available SOFC mCHP system operating in a real building; under a UK context. This paper aims to assess the emission and economic performance of a commercially available solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mCHP system, operating at The University of Nottingham's Creative Energy Homes. The performance assessment evaluates, over a one year period, the associated carbon (emission assessment) and operational costs (economic assessment) of the SOFC mCHP case compared to a ‘base case’ of grid electricity and a highly efficient gas boiler. Results from the annual assessment show that the SOFC mCHP system can generate annual emission reductions of up to 56...|$|E

30|$|We {{provide an}} {{estimation}} of the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> necessary to generate the neutrally buoyant plume above the TAG hydrothermal mound, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, located at 26 °N, using a model of plume rise in a density-stratified environment with crossflow. The estimated <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> is 460 ± 40 MW. Previous studies have estimated that the <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> from high-temperature hydrothermal discharge and low-temperature diffuse flow at the TAG hydrothermal mound are 90 ± 20 MW and at least 780 MW, respectively. Consequently, the contribution of diffuse flow to make the neutrally buoyant plume is 370 ± 60 MW, which accounts for approximately 80 % of the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> to the neutrally buoyant plume. As this contribution is less than 50 % of the total <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> from the diffuse flow, {{it is likely that}} more than 50 % of the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> from the diffuse flow dissipates in the ambient current.|$|R
40|$|Klebsiella aerogenes {{has been}} grown in carbon-limited chemostats and the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of {{different}} steady states measured by pumping the culture through an LKB flow microcalorimeter. Initially the flow time between fermentor and microcalorimeter cell was 5 minutes {{during which time}} the steady-state conditions of the chemostat were disturbed and the measured <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> was less than that in the fermentor. To minimise this problem a specially designed fermentor was fitted into the airbath of the microcalorimeter, thus providing temperature control and reducing the flow time between fermentor and microcalorimeter to 1 minute. This design was adequate providing only one dilution rate was used in each experiment. If different dilution rates {{were used in the}} same experiment the fermentor contents could not be maintained at 37 C and inaccurate <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> were recorded. It is believed that with modifications this design may be used to accurately determine the energy changes occuring in chemostat cultures. K. aerogenes has been grown in batch culture in media limited by carbon or nitrogen. Characteristic heat output-time records were obtained for each medium. As growth proceeded the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> increased steadily until oxygen became limiting whereupon the rate of <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> decreased. During the stationary phase endogenous metabolism occurred in the carbon-limited media and slow degradation of excess carbon in the nitrogen-limited media both of which gave rise to relatively large <b>heat</b> <b>outputs.</b> The total <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of nitrogen-limited cultures was greater than that of carbon-limited cultures. When glycine replaced ammonium sulphate as nitrogen source the total <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> was increased. Very inefficient growth occurred when glycine provided both the carbon and nitrogen source. The <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of all cultures changed with changes in oxygen tension, pH, biomass and flow rate between fermentor and microcalorimeter. <p...|$|R
40|$|The new {{research}} projects in Australia into direct utilisation of solar energy and into measurements of global radiation are reviewed {{against the background}} of the awakened world-wide research interest. The design of a small thermosyphon operated domestic solar water heater without auxiliary heating is described and curves are presented showing the effect of the relevant variables on flow rate through the solar collector system. Performance of the solar water heater during winter, autumn and summer is analysed from records made on the domestic unit. Comparisons are made between the <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> under various operating conditions and the available solar energy on the collector surface, computed from simultaneous observations of global radiation using multiplying factors for angular position of the surface developed later in the thesis. The installation of the global radiation measuring instrument is also described. The importance of satisfactory estimates of available solar energy to permit economic design of solar water heaters is noted, and some existing methods of estimation studied. A new method of estimation is proposed and checked against observations at seven Australian stations, and the accuracy of the estimates for monthly averages is compared to the observed variations in monthly mean values of global radiation at Mount Stromlo over 12 years. The effect of angles of bearing and inclination of the collector surface on solar energy gain is studied, taking into account distribution of solar energy during the day and the effect of energy losses through the glass collector covers. Curves are presented to allow determination of gross and nett solar energy on inclined surfaces for average days in each month of the year at Sydney. A list is given of the detailed studies considered for future research as a result of experience gained in the operation of the domestic solar water heater...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study two {{pozzolanic}} materials are used, Metakaolin (MK) and Fly Ash (PFA), as binary and ternary partial replacement binders with Portland cement (PC) to investigate their effect on {{the rate of heat}} evolution (dQ/dt in J/gh) during hydration, and the heat of hydration, (Q(t) in J/g). For binary PC–PFA blends PC hydration is enhanced in the very early stages of hydration, but at extended periods (up to 120 h) an increase in PFA replacement level causes a systematic reduction in <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b> For binary PC–MK blends the results suggest that the MK initially diminishes PC hydration but the subsequent pozzolanic reaction of MK increasingly contributes to the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> causing some blends to exceed the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of the PC control. For both systems a principal controlling factor in the PC hydration rate (and the heat evolution rate) is the water requirement of the pozzolan, but for PC–MK blends the pozzolanic reaction of the MK makes a significant contribution to the <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b> However this reaction is controlled both by the availability of water and the supply of Ca 2 + ions from the hydrating PC which introduces an increasing level of complexity to the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> versus time profiles.

40|$|Geothermal waters {{from the}} Waimangu, Waiotapu-Waikite and Reporoa {{geothermal}} systems {{find their way}} into three separate watersheds. The heat flow data from each of these drainage areas have been assessed making it possible to compare the <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> from two independent methods: direct heat measurements and the chloride flux method. For both the Waiotapu/Reporoa Valley drainage and the Waikite drainage a discrepancy exists between the two assessments, with the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> observed at the surface (Waiotapu- 540 {+-} 110 MW; Waikite- 80 MW) nearly double of that calculated from the chloride flux (300 MW; 36 MW respectively). It appears that much of the throughput of chloride does not reach the surface within the area which was monitored and the basic assumption on which the method is based has been violated. For Waimangu the direct <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> is assessed as 510 {+-} 60 MW. However the ratio of enthalpy to chloride concentration of the source fluid is not well determined.

This control method is called qualitative-quantitative control method of <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> with utilization of prediction of daily diagram of heat supply in hot-water piping systems of district heating. The control method consists in simultaneous and continuous acting of two variables influencing the transferred <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> and in using the prediction of required <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> in a specific locality. The control method should enable elimination {{of the influence of}} transport delay between the heat source and heat consumption of individual relatively concentrated consumers. Transport delay can be in the range up to several hours and depends on the length of feeder piping, which can be up to several kilometers, and on the flow speed of heat transfer medium. © 2015, North Atlantic University Union.

40|$|Rational {{composting}} {{process control}} involves the interrelated factors of <b>heat</b> <b>output,</b> temperature, ventilation, and water removal. The heat is released microbially {{at the expense}} of organic material; temperature is an effect and, because it is a determinant of microbial activity, it is also a cause of heat output; ventilation supplies oxygen and removes heat, mainly through the vaporization of water; water removal results from heat removal. These relationships were implemented in a field-scale process of static-pile configuration, using a mixture of sewage sludge and wood chips. Heat removal was matched to <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> through a temperature feedback control system, thereby maintaining biologically favorable temperatures. The observations indicate that fundamentally {{there are two kinds of}} composting systems: those that are and those that are not temperature self-limiting. The self-limiting system reaches inhibitive temperatures (> 60 °C) which debilitate the microbial community, suppressing decomposition, <b>heat</b> <b>output,</b> and water removal. In contrast, non-self-limiting temperatures (< 60 °C) support a robust community, promoting decomposition, <b>heat</b> <b>output,</b> and water removal...|$|R

40|$|Simple {{correlations}} {{and corresponding}} nomographs are presented, which express the maximum <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> received from salt-gradient solar ponds {{throughout the year}} or during a specified season of the year, and the corresponding optimum depth of the nonconvective zone {{in terms of the}} thickness of the upper convective zone and the temperature under which the maximum <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> is received. The correlations are valid for the Athens (Greece) area or for regions with a similar climate, because solar radiation and ambient temperature values for Athens have been employed, obtained by a statistical process of hourly measurements over a period of about 20 years. For other climates, it is easy to develop similar correlations using the same methodology. Development of the proposed correlations is based on a method, which simulates the transient operation of the salt-gradient pond using finite-differences, and calculates the <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> received hourly along the typical year. Thus, the <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> received during a period or throughout the year is calculated as a sum of hourly values. Calculations of the <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> are performed for a great number of values of the parameters of the problem, and the combinations of values that maximize <b>useful</b> <b>heat</b> are selected and used for developing correlations and corresponding nomographs.

ATP-content, arginine ammonification, hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate, Fe(III) -reduction) were compared over a period of 7 to 8 weeks with respect to their sensitivity to indicate modifications of the soil microflora. An agricultural soil was amended with two pesticides and HgCl 2 (Ioxynil 2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg; Thiram 5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg; HgCl 2 2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg). The results show that all methods at least slightly differ from each other, indicating that each one reflects only a part of the microbial life in the soil. Due to limited nutrient supply {{the main part of the}} soil microflora is dormant, but can be activated by addition of an anergy source. While <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> after addition of glucose (potential <b>heat</b> <b>output)</b> determines the whole microflora in the active state, <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> without glucose (actual <b>heat</b> <b>output)</b> seems to indicate mainly the active micro organisms. The ATP-determinatiom seems to indicate as well as at least a part of the dormant microorganisms. The arginine ammonification proved to be very sentitive. As the mineralization of arginine is widespread, the arginine degrading enzymes seem to be more sensitive to the addition of pesticides than the microorganism itself.
