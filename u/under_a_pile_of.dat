5|$|There {{were three}} {{telephones}} {{at the farm}} on the night, {{all on the same}} landline. There was usually a cordless phone with a memory-recall feature in the kitchen; a beige digital phone, also kept in the kitchen; and a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom. (There was normally a fourth phone too, a blue digital phone in the first-floor office, but it had been sent for repairs on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the bedroom and into the kitchen, where the police found it after the murders with its receiver off the hook. They found the beige digital phone <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> magazines in the kitchen.|$|E

The official was found stoned to death <b>under</b> <b>a</b> large <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> rocks in the town's main square. A Mexican Army unit occupied the town for some days after the incident, but investigators failed to find anyone in town who knew anything about what happened.|$|R

It was found <b>under</b> <b>a</b> small <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> stones and was {{brought back to}} Gilgit and buried in an orchard that later became the town's Christian cemetery. His tombstone, ironically {{paid for by the}} Maharaja of Kashmir, reads: [...] "To the memory of G. W. Hayward, Gold Medallist of the Royal Geographical Society of London, who was cruelly murdered at Darkot, 18 July 1870, on his journey to explore the Pamir steppe.

25|$|On 1 September Sutcliffe murdered 20-year-old Barbara Leach, a Bradford University student. Her {{body was}} dumped {{at the rear}} of 13, Ashgrove <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> bricks, close to the {{university}} and her lodgings. It was his sixteenth attack. The murder of a woman who was not a prostitute again alarmed the public and prompted an expensive publicity campaign emphasising the Wearside connection. Despite the false lead, Sutcliffe was interviewed on at least two other occasions in 1979. Despite matching several forensic clues and being on the list of 300 names in connection with the £5 note, he was not strongly suspected. Sutcliffe was interviewed by police nine times.|$|E

[...] It is also said that Geary's red sash was unravelled and the thread was used for various ornamental purposes, his sword was melted to make teaspoons and his stiff leather hat was used by a farmer to dip oats from his feed bin for his horses.|$|E
2500|$|The follow-up, 1979's Electric Nights, {{was more}} successful. [...] "Shoe Shine", which {{combined}} disco rhythms and melodies with an angry lead vocal and lyrics about poverty and destitution, reached number 11 in France and also entered Billboard's Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart. However, despite including both hard rockers such as [...] "Elixir of Life" [...] and [...] "Hotel Blues" [...] and laments such as [...] "Short Ends" [...] and [...] "Wild Geese" [...] alongside the disco-flavoured numbers, Capaldi retained no fondness for his two albums with RSO, later saying [...] "frankly, they got buried <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> disco." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{anonymous}} {{warning was}} taken seriously by the US government, and the State Department cabled the bulletin {{to dozens of}} embassies. The FAA sent it to all US carriers, including Pan Am, which had charged each of the passengers a $5 security surcharge, promising a [...] "program that will screen passengers, employees, airport facilities, baggage and aircraft with unrelenting thoroughness"; the security team in Frankfurt found the warning <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> papers on a desk {{the day after the}} bombing. One of the Frankfurt security screeners, whose job was to spot explosive devices under X-ray, told ABC News that she had first learned what Semtex (a plastic explosive) was during her ABC interview 11 months after the bombing.|$|E

Gordon regains consciousness <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> rubble and is found by Alyx and Dog. Their proximity to the Citadel, coupled with its imminent explosion, which would level much of City 17, requires them to go back inside and stabilize the core, stalling the structure's destruction long enough for both themselves {{and much of the}} human population to escape. Gordon and Alyx succeed in doing so, but learn that the local Combine forces are attempting to send a distress message for off-world assistance, using the Citadel's destruction to power the transmission.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} after Erroll's body was discovered, de Janzé went to the morgue with a friend to see his body. According to eyewitnesses, Alice stunned those in {{attendance}} by leaving a tree branch on Erroll's corpse, and whispering the words: [...] "Now you are mine forever". Eyewitness and close friend Julian Lezzard suspected that Alice was the murderer, since it fitted with her morbid preoccupations; it was even rumoured that Alice herself had admitted to the killing. [...] In his investigative book, White Mischief, journalist James Fox mentions a suspicious incident regarding Alice and her possible connection to the crime. A {{few months after the}} murder, Alice went away for a few days and asked a neighbour to look after her house. In her absence, one of Alice's houseboys came to the neighbour, and produced a revolver, which he claimed he had found by a bridge, <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> stones on Alice's land.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} toad is nocturnal {{and lives}} in a burrow by day, or sometimes hides <b>under</b> <b>a</b> log or <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> debris.

In winter it may become inactive and remain in its burrow for extended periods.|$|R
60|$|Farmer Brown's boy {{sat with}} his chin in his hands staring at the new pond in the Green Forest and at the dam which had made it. That dam puzzled him. Who could have built it? What did they build it for? Why hadn't he heard them chopping? He looked {{carelessly}} at the stump {{of one of the}} trees, and then a still more puzzled look made deep furrows between his eyes. It looked-- yes, it looked very much as if teeth, and not an axe, had cut down that tree. Farmer Brown's boy stared and stared, his mouth gaping wide open. He looked so funny that Peter Rabbit, who was hiding <b>under</b> <b>an</b> old <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> brush close by, nearly laughed right out.|$|R
5000|$|Soldaten Humbert (Private Humbert) is a caveman-like soldier {{covered in}} a thick fur and having very poor {{personal}} hygiene and revolting habits, taken to grotesque extremes such as eating his own lice, forcing anyone near him to wear a gas mask, and eating {{with his bare hands}} claiming that [...] "this way, flies stick to the fingers and don't enter the mouth". He is implied to never have bathed in his life (but this is also implied of the Sergenten), and an attempt to shave off his fur results in him disappearing <b>under</b> <b>a</b> large <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> hair, raising doubts as to his actually being human. He often is shown as only capable of grunting and screaming, but in some strips he can talk normally and drive a motorcycle.|$|R
2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{a phone call}} from Yutaka, whom Masamichi initially disapproves of, Yuki, who has not changed clothing from the events of the previous chapter, leaves her house, grabs him, and takes him to a rooftop, where they try to explain things after Yutaka was being questioned by Asako and Mami. She goes over everything, even why she referred to herself as a [...] "monster", which Yuki's friends previously overheard and misunderstood. Realizing that Miho is the cause of this mess, Yutaka indirectly vows revenge, but Yuki stops him. Yutaka goes anyway and meets his brother in front of Megagamers, who has tracked Miho to the store since the previous night. Yutaka's brother is a member of a group of Nanasawa fans who plan to intervene and remind Piro who his true love is to get rid of Miho. However, Dom's van is blocking the store's entrance. Though Yuki protests against intervention to the group, Dom, who is unknown to them, performs his own method of intervention anyway and forces Piro to choose between Nanasawa and Miho. [...] It is currently unknown if Dom knows who Miho is, but Miho, in a disguise, overhears the conversation and forces Piro to briefly wear a hat. At the same time, Yuki, deciding that she can wait no longer, steals Dom's van and guns, and rushes into the store with Yutaka in tow. Seeing this, Miho grabs Piro and rushes upstairs, discarding the hat in the process. Yuki subsequently collides with the hat and a presumed explosion occurs, stalling Yuki and Yutaka. Miho and Piro don cosplay outfits as a disguise, escape, and {{make their way to the}} local bath house. Just before Yuki grabs Yutaka again, Dom, now trapped <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> rubble, expresses his condolences to Yutaka, to which he does not understand. The pair quickly follow Miho and Piro and await for them to leave the bath house.|$|E

60|$|There was a {{dangerous}} edge of personality to his voice. She was offended and agitated. She turned her shoulder on him, stared through the back window, studying this typical center of a typical Main Street block, a vista hidden from casual strollers. The backs of the chief establishments in town surrounded a quadrangle neglected, dirty, and incomparably dismal. From the front, Howland & Gould's grocery was smug enough, but attached to the rear was a lean-to of storm streaked pine lumber with a sanded tar roof--a staggering doubtful shed behind which was a heap of ashes, splintered packing-boxes, shreds of excelsior, crumpled straw-board, broken olive-bottles, rotten fruit, and utterly disintegrated vegetables: orange carrots turning black, and potatoes with ulcers. The rear of the Bon Ton Store was grim with blistered black-painted iron shutters, <b>under</b> them <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> once glossy red shirt-boxes, now a pulp from recent rain.|$|R

Plates serve to keep magma in the mantle. Incipient plate boundaries and LIPs form where the lithosphere is extending, probably assisted by magma fracture. New rifts often experience a burst of magmatism, suggesting a fertile shallow mantle. Locations of rifts are controlled by lithospheric conditions, and the volumes of magmas by mantle fertility, ponding, and focusing. Recycled materials melt because of low melting temperatures and the large heat bath provided by the mantle itself. (keywords; LIPs, plumes, hotspots, lithosphere, eclogite...|$|R
50|$|Cathy joins them, also {{recognizing}} the fragments. She {{goes with the}} two men to the Simpson farm; they find the farmhouse in ruins <b>under</b> <b>a</b> large <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> black rocks and Ginny's parents dead. The girl is still alive but in a catatonic state. At Dr. Reynolds' request, they rush her to Dr. Steve Hendricks (Harry Jackson) at the California Medical Research Institute in Los Angeles. He later reports that Ginny is slowly turning to stone; her only hope lies with identifying the black rock within eight hours. Dave brings a fragment to his old college professor, Arthur Flanders (Trevor Bardette), who determines that {{it came from a}} meteorite. Back at the Simpson farm, both men notice a discoloration in the ground: The black rock is draining something from everything it touches, including people. Later, tests show that silicon is that substance; in humans it is normally just a trace element. Dr. Reynolds explains that research indicates that one possible function of silicon in the human body is to maintain human tissue flexibility. They suddenly realize that the meteorite's absorption of silicon was the cause of Ben's death, Ginny's condition, and the death of her parents; Steve then prepares and administers a silicon solution injection to the girl.|$|R

There were also parcels of new music--though the piano (it had come years ago by the Sofala in the damp atmosphere of the forests was generally out of tune.) It was vexing to be cut off from everything for sixty days at a stretch sometimes, without any means of knowing what was the matter. And when the Sofala reappeared Mr. Van Wyk would descend the steps of the veranda and stroll over the grass plot in front of his house, down to the waterside, with a frown on his white brow.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show the {{seismicity}} and velocity {{structure of a}} segment of the Alpine retro-belt front along the continental collision margin of the Venetian Alps (NE Italy). Our goal is to gain insight on the buried structures and deep fault geometry in a “silent” area, i. e., an area with poor instrumental seismicity but high potential for future earthquakes, as indicated by historical earthquakes (1695 Me = 6. 7 Asolo and 1936 Ms = 5. 8 Bosco del Cansiglio). Local earthquakes recorded by a dense temporary seismic network are used to compute 3 -D Vp and Vp/Vs tomographic images, yielding well resolved images of the upper crust underneath the south-Alpine front. We show the presence of two main distinct high Vp S-verging thrust units, the innermost coincides with the piedmont hill and the outermost is buried <b>under</b> <b>a</b> thick <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> sediments in the Po plain. Background seismicity and Vp/Vs anomalies, interpreted as cracked fluid-filled volumes, suggest that the NE portion of the outermost blind thrust and its oblique/lateral ramps may be a zone of high fluid pressure prone to future earthquakes. Three-dimensional focal mechanisms show compressive and transpressive solutions, in agreement with the tectonic setting, stress field maps and geodetic observations. The bulk of the microseismicity is clustered in two different areas, both in correspondence of inherited lateral ramps of the thrust system. Tomographic images highlight the influence of the paleogeographic setting in the tectonic style and seismic activity of the region...|$|R

40|$|We report {{simultaneous}} laboratory {{measurements of}} seismic velocities and fluid permeability on lava flow basalt from Etna (Italy). Results {{were obtained for}} dry and saturated samples deformed under triaxial compression. During each test, the effective pressure was first increased up to 190 MPa to investigate the effect of pre-existing crack closure on seismic properties. Then, the effective pressure was unloaded down to 20 MPa, a pressure which mirrors the stress field acting <b>under</b> <b>a</b> lava <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> approximately 1. 5 – 2 km thick, and deviatoric stress was increased until failure of the specimens. Using an effective medium model, the measured elastic wave velocities were inverted in terms of two crack densities: ρi the crack density of the pre-existing thermal cracks and ρv the crack density of the stress-induced cracks. In addition a link was established between elastic properties (elastic wave velocities Vp and Vs) and permeability using a statistical permeability model. Our {{results show that the}} velocities increase with increasing hydrostatic pressure up to 190 MPa, due to the closure of the pre-existing thermal cracks. This is interpreted by a decrease of the crack density ρi from ~ 1 to 0. 2. The effect of pre-existing cracks closure is also highlighted by the permeability evolution which decreases of more than two orders of magnitude. Under deviatoric loading, the velocities signature is interpreted, in the first stage of the loading, by the closure of the pre-existing thermal cracks. However, with increasing deviatoric loading newly-formed vertical cracks nucleate and propagate. This is clearly seen from the velocity signature and its interpretation in term of crack density, from the location of the acoustic emission sources, and from microstructural observations. This competition between pre-existing cracks closure and propagation of vertical cracks is also seen from the permeability evolution, and our study shows that mechanically-induced cracks has lesser influence on permeability change than pre-existing thermal cracks...|$|R
