50|$|This {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{aboveground}} Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line stations with two tracks (the other being 242nd Street). A center express track, which is currently <b>unused</b> in <b>revenue</b> service, forms just north of this station and runs nonstop to just south of 242nd Street.|$|R
50|$|Track 1 is <b>unused</b> by <b>revenue</b> trains (though it is {{sometimes}} used to park track maintenance equipment), and has neither a departure signal nor overhead catenary. Much of the track-space has been cannibalized {{for the use of}} stairs and elevator to the concourse above the platform.|$|R
50|$|This {{station has}} three tracks and two side platforms. The {{northbound}} local track merges {{with the center}} track north of the station and the line continues north as two tracks. The middle track from here south to 103rd Street is <b>unused</b> for <b>revenue</b> service. The platforms here are offset with the northbound one being slightly more to the south.|$|R
5000|$|This {{station has}} two side {{platforms}} and three tracks {{with the middle}} track <b>unused</b> in <b>revenue</b> service. The two platforms have beige windscreens and green canopies that run for nearly the entire length. The north end has black waist-level fences only. The platform signs consist of black boards with [...] "Avenue U" [...] in white lettering.|$|R
50|$|This {{station has}} three tracks and two side platforms. In the past, it was {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} terminal station. There are switches north of the station that allow northbound trains to enter the underground 137th Street Yard, {{then return to the}} other side of the station for the next trip south. The center express track that passes through the station is currently <b>unused</b> in <b>revenue</b> service.|$|R
5000|$|... 116th Street-Columbia University is a {{local station}} on the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line of the New York City Subway, served by the 1 train at all times. It {{is located at the}} {{intersection}} of Broadway and 116th Street, just outside the west gate to the main campus of Columbia University and the southeast corner of the Barnard College campus. The express track that passes through the station is currently <b>unused</b> in <b>revenue</b> service.|$|R
50|$|North of the station, {{the outer}} and bypass tracks head towards the Manhattan Bridge to Manhattan with a flying junction, where express trains can use either {{the north side}} of the bridge via the Chrystie Street Connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line or the south side of the bridge to the BMT Broadway Line. Local trains {{continue}} on the middle tracks north along the BMT Fourth Avenue Line into the Montague Street Tunnel towards the BMT Broadway Line or the BMT Nassau Street Line, the latter of which is <b>unused</b> in <b>revenue</b> service.|$|R
5000|$|The {{southbound}} {{platform is}} slightly higher {{at the southern}} end of the station because the next stop south, Fulton Street, is bi-level with the southbound platform being above the northern one. The two [...] "express" [...] tracks, currently <b>unused</b> in regular <b>revenue</b> service, merge into a single tail track south of the station. The tail track is 620 ft long from the switch points to the bumper block, where an emergency exit is available.|$|R
5000|$|Unable {{to develop}} the lands rapidly enough for agriculture, Brant {{proposed}} leasing them to settlers; he was also worried that European-Canadian settlers would otherwise squat on the Iroquois lands and gain control. The British colonial governor John Graves Simcoe wanted all sales or leases handled by the British. [...] "By stereotyping Indians as naive primitives, colonial officials frustrated native attempts to exploit the commercial potential of their land." [...] He opposed {{the idea of having}} whites lease from the Mohawk and used William Claus, deputy superintendent of the Six Nations at Grand River, to carry out his policy. With the approval of the Mohawk but not the British, in 1798 Brant sold major blocks of <b>unused</b> land, with <b>revenues</b> to be invested in a British-Canadian bank to yield an annuity for the Mohawk people. Brant died in 1807.|$|R
