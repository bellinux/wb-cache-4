5|$|It is {{possible}} to achieve an extremely high Q with mechanical resonators. Mechanical resonators typically have a Q of 10,000 or so, and 25,000 can be achieved in torsional resonators using a particular nickel-iron alloy. This is an <b>unreasonably</b> high figure to achieve with LC circuits, whose Q {{is limited by the}} resistance of the inductor coils.|$|E
5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to <b>unreasonably</b> harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly unfair. Paul {{does not believe in}} legalizing the recreational use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E
5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land <b>unreasonably</b> and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be <b>unreasonably</b> expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E
5|$|Wilton {{returned}} for the series' 2005 Christmas special as Davies wanted {{to include a}} familiar character whose presence would ease the transition following {{a change in the}} series' lead actor. Despite her character having been introduced as fair minded and hard working, Harriet is depicted as an uncompromising Prime Minister, which led to comparisons to real life politicians. Response to the character's political decisions prompted mixed commentary from the media; some reviewers felt that the character had acted <b>unreasonably</b> whilst others sympathised with her actions and felt her scripted political demise was unjust.|$|E
25|$|No {{unreasonable}} discrimination. Fixed broadband providers may not <b>unreasonably</b> discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic.|$|E
25|$|PBGC's {{long-term}} cost can {{be expected}} to be <b>unreasonably</b> higher if it does not terminate the plan.|$|E
25|$|Costs of {{continuing}} the plan have become <b>unreasonably</b> burdensome {{solely because of}} {{a decline in the}} employer's workforce.|$|E
25|$|Such conduct has {{the purpose}} or effect of <b>unreasonably</b> interfering with an individual's work {{performance}} or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{hearing the}} {{application}}, the court may either dismiss the petition, or make the order for winding-up. The court may dismiss the application if the petitioner <b>unreasonably</b> refrains from an alternative course of action.|$|E
25|$|Illinois v. Caballes, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that the Fourth Amendment is not {{violated}} when the use of a drug-sniffing dog during a routine traffic stop does not <b>unreasonably</b> prolong the length of the stop.|$|E
25|$|This {{order was}} {{applied only to}} fixed {{operators}}. This order forbids fixed network operators from <b>unreasonably</b> discriminating against lawful network traffic. The FCC did not order for mobile operators because, according to the FCC, competition in the mobile networking space rendered it unnecessary. This order was vacated by the court.|$|E
25|$|This {{political}} hijacking of Florida's {{medical examiner}} {{system should be}} of concern to everyone. Without confidence in the independence of medical examiners, every decision can reasonably be questioned and <b>unreasonably</b> be scrutinized. Medical examiners {{from every corner of}} our country have added their names, alarmed about these events and their consequences.|$|E
25|$|Medan-Kuala Namu International Airport-Tebing Tinggi, 80 {{percent of}} the land needed for the toll road {{construction}} is owned by state plantation which it is easy to take over, whether the remaining 20 percent is owned by local residents which it is difficult to take over due to <b>unreasonably</b> high prices.|$|E
25|$|Reasonable Use Rule (American Rule): This rule {{does not}} {{guarantee}} the landowner a set amount of water, but allows unlimited extraction {{as long as the}} result does not <b>unreasonably</b> damage other wells or the aquifer system. Usually this rule gives great weight to historical uses and prevents new uses that interfere with the prior use.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of zero {{tolerance}} {{believe that such}} a policy neglects investigation {{on a case-by-case basis}} and may lead to <b>unreasonably</b> harsh penalties for crimes that may not warrant such penalties in reality. Another criticism of zero-tolerance policies is that it gives officers and the legal system little discretion in dealing with offenders. Zero-tolerance policies may prohibit their enforcers from making the punishment fit the crime.|$|E
25|$|In response, West Virginia filed {{a lawsuit}} to declare invalid the withdrawal-notice {{requirement}} stipulated in the Big East's bylaws. The lawsuit alleged that the Big East breached its fiduciary duty by allowing several football-playing members to depart, causing the conference to {{no longer be a}} major football conference and jeopardizing its continued existence. Because of this, West Virginia alleged, its continued performance under the contract had become <b>unreasonably</b> burdensome and its original purpose in entering into the contract had been eliminated.|$|E
25|$|The crater is the {{smallest}} identified in Finland, 1.4km diameter and 150 m deep. Due to sediments the lake has a maximum depth of 26m which is unusually deep for a lake in the region. Karikkoselkä {{is estimated to be}} between 230 Ma and 450 Ma (million years old), most likely near 240 Ma (Triassic or earlier). Some sources give an <b>unreasonably</b> young age of 1.88 Ma, which is likely a misquotation– the discovery paper mentions that the bedrock in the region (known as the Central Finland Granite Complex) formed about 1.88 Ga (thousand million years ago), in the late Paleoproterozoic era.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, the NBR {{failed to}} carry out any {{significant}} improvement at Methil. Wemyss and his tenants found that {{the limitations of the}} harbour were <b>unreasonably</b> constraining their businesses: ships suffering 14 days waiting in the roads for a berth and five days to load were recorded as typical. The NBR harbour at Burntisland was unattractive to the East Fife coalmasters, but for some time Wemyss was unable to persuade the NBR to attend to the issue, although he pressed Conacher to agree to build the new works at Methil, in a series of meetings and increasingly urgent letters in 1893.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 George Smiley, the {{new chief}} of the secret {{intelligence}} service referred to as The Circus, continues to investigate his spy service {{in the aftermath of}} his exposure of Bill Haydon as Gerald the mole. Attempting to follow the trail of Karla, the Moscow Centre spymaster and to protect his politically-weakened spy service, Smiley launches an offensive against the Soviets. He and analysts Connie Sachs and Doc di Salis look into investigations <b>unreasonably</b> suppressed by the outed mole. They discover that Sam Collins's investigation of a money laundering operation in Laos could point to involvement by Karla.|$|E
25|$|In 485 Zeno sent {{against the}} rebels a fresh army, said {{to consist of}} Macedonians and Scythians (Tillemont conjectures, not <b>unreasonably,</b> that these were Ostrogoths) under John the Hunchback, or, more probably, John the Scythian, and Theoderic the Amal, who was at this time consul. John {{defeated}} the rebels near Seleucia and drove them into the fort of Papurius where he blockaded them. After few months Trocundus died; the fort was taken only {{after four years of}} siege, by the treachery of Trocondus's brother-in-law, who had been sent for the purpose from Constantinople by Zeno, and Illus and Leontius were beheaded (488) and their heads sent to the Emperor.|$|E
25|$|As Lyon Court is a {{government}} department, fees paid for granting coats of arms are paid to the Treasury. The misuse of arms is a criminal offence in Scotland, and treated as tax evasion. Prosecutions are brought before Lyon Court, Lord Lyon being the sole judge. Appeals from the Lyon Court {{can be made to}} the Court of Session in Edinburgh. There is no appeal if the Lord Lyon refuses to grant a coat of arms, as this is not a judicial function, but an exercise of his ministerial function, although an appeal by way of judicial review may succeed if it can be shown that the Lord Lyon acted <b>unreasonably.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{limitations}} {{exist on}} the power to enact ordinances. The Supreme Court of the United States has held that the United States Constitution requires that laws, including municipal ordinances, may not be arbitrary or discriminatory, {{and may not be}} <b>unreasonably</b> vague, so that a resident may be reasonably certain that their conduct conforms to the law. Furthermore, local governments can not delegate the power to enact ordinances to other bodies. However, they may establish fixed and certain standards for carrying out certain activities (such as home building or operating restaurants), and then delegate to subordinate bodies the power to make rules governing how residents can demonstrate compliance with these standards.|$|E
25|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act sets certain {{standards}} for building access and other design considerations in all new construction and major renovations in the U.S. An architectural barrier is any feature that makes access {{or use of}} a building difficult, <b>unreasonably</b> dangerous or impossible. This can include aisles that are too narrow for easy access by a wheelchair. Often, {{the only way to}} get from a row of chairs, shelves, workstations, etc., to an exit is by an aisle. Historically, many deaths and serious injuries have occurred due to fire, inhalation of smoke or noxious fumes, etc., because blocked or partially blocked aisles prevented persons from promptly leaving a dangerous area.|$|E
25|$|Police {{power is}} {{exercised}} by the legislative and executive {{branches of the}} various states through the enactment and enforcement of laws. States {{have the power to}} compel obedience to these laws through whatever measures they see fit, provided these measures do not infringe upon any of the rights protected by the United States Constitution or in the various state constitutions, and are not <b>unreasonably</b> arbitrary or oppressive. Methods of enforcement can include legal sanctions, physical means, and other forms of coercion and inducement. Controversies over the exercise of state police power can arise when exercise by state authorities conflicts with individual rights and freedoms.|$|E
25|$|It has {{repeatedly}} been suggested, e.g. {{in the movie}} Jurassic Park, that Brachiosaurus could rear into a bipedal or tripodal (with tail support) pose to feed. However, a detailed physical modelling-based analysis of sauropod rearing capabilities by Heinrich Mallison showed that while many sauropods could rear, the unusual brachiosaurid body shape and limb length ratio made them exceptionally ill suited for rearing. The forward position {{of the center of}} mass would have led to problems with stability, and required <b>unreasonably</b> large forces in the hips to obtain an upright posture. Brachiosaurus would also have gained relatively little from rearing (only 33% more feeding height), compared to other sauropods, for which a bipedal pose may have tripled the feeding height.|$|E
25|$|Inslaw's initial filing {{claimed that}} the {{contract}} disputes arose because the DOJ officials who administered the contract were biased against Inslaw. The filing specifically mentioned Promis project manager, C. Madison Brewer, and Associate Attorney General, D. Lowell Jensen. Brewer had previously been Inslaw's general counsel, but according to Inslaw had been terminated for cause. Inslaw claimed that Brewer's dismissal caused him to be <b>unreasonably</b> biased against Inslaw and owner William Hamilton. Jensen {{was a member of}} the project oversight committee at the time of the contract. He had helped to develop another competing case management software system several years earlier, and Inslaw claimed that this led him to be prejudiced against Promis, so that he ignored the unreasonable bias of Brewer.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of fast fashion trend {{also contributes to}} the arisen of sweatshops. Fast fashion trend refers to “rapid reorders and new orders that retailers now exert as they discern sales trends in real time” (Ross, 2015) To {{catch up with the}} fast-changing fashion trends to satisfy increasing customers’ demand, these fast-fashion brands have to react and arrange production accordingly. To lower production and the storage cost, they are always searching for cheaper labour which can produce orders {{in a short period of}} time. This results in workers suffering from <b>unreasonably</b> long working hours without reasonable payment. A documentary, “The True Cost” (2015), points out that sweatshop is a story of passing pressure from the retailers to factory owners and ends on the workers (including sew-machine operators, cutters and pressers). Workers are exploited in the name of cheap clothes.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a seizure}} that is {{justified}} at its inception may become unreasonable {{if it is}} <b>unreasonably</b> prolonged in duration. Thus, if the sole reason for the stop is to issue a warning to the motorist, the stop becomes unreasonable if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably necessary to issue the warning. And if a drug-sniffing dog is used during this unreasonable extension, {{the use of the}} dog violates the Fourth Amendment. The Illinois Supreme Court reasoned that using the dog changed the character of the encounter from a routine traffic stop to a drug investigation, and that transformation had to be supported by reasonable suspicion. The Supreme Court instead reasoned that the dog sniff does not change the character of an encounter unless the dog sniff invaded any of the citizen's other reasonable expectations of privacy. The Court concluded it did not.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{initially}} {{had nearly}} 5,000 colonials at his command, but General William Shirley, {{the governor of}} Massachusetts who had been commissioned to lead a simultaneous expedition to Fort Niagara, shifted some of Johnson's men and resources to his own campaign. Tensions escalated as the two generals worked {{against each other in}} recruiting Native allies. The dispute was complicated by the unusual command structure: as Braddock's second-in-command, General Shirley was Johnson's superior officer, {{but when it came to}} Indian affairs, Johnson was theoretically in charge. In time, Shirley would blame the failure of his expedition on Johnson's refusal to provide him with adequate Indian support. According to the Johnson biographer Milton Hamilton, historians usually portrayed Johnson as acting <b>unreasonably</b> in the controversy with Shirley, but Hamilton argued that Johnson was reacting to Shirley's clumsy Indian diplomacy, which harmed the British relationship with the Six Nations.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 2014, {{there were}} around 17.4 million flex-fuel {{vehicles}} in use in the country. However, according to the U.S. Department of Energy in 2011 only 862,837 flex-fuel fleet-operated vehicles were regularly fueled with E85. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, {{signed into law by}} President Bush on 8 August 2005, in its Section 701 requires the federal government's fleet of vehicles capable of operating on alternative fuels to be operated on these fuels exclusively, unless a waiver is granted if the alternative fuel is not reasonably available; or if the cost of the fuel required is <b>unreasonably</b> more expensive compared to gasoline. By 2008 the Federal vehicle fleet consisted of 594,900 vehicles, of which 128,491 run on E85, representing the majority of the alternative fuel vehicles in the Federal fleet that year. According to the Government Accountability Office, in 2010 Federal employees received waivers to use gasoline in 55 percent of fleet flex-fuel vehicles because E85 was not available.|$|E
25|$|A {{resident}} {{who wishes to}} challenge the validity of an ordinance need not wait until it has been enforced against them (although it may be challenged at that time). Instead, a resident may bring an action for a declaratory judgment alleging that the ordinance is void {{because it was not}} properly noticed, goes beyond the county charter, is arbitrary, discriminatory, or <b>unreasonably</b> vague, or that it is preempted by state or federal law. An ordinance will be deemed preempted if it addresses an activity for which the state has prohibited local regulation altogether, or where it is inconsistent with state law. An ordinance may not permit an activity that is expressly prohibited by state law, or prohibits an activity that is expressly permitted by state law. However, if some state regulation exists as to an activity, political subdivisions may impose further regulations on that activity so long as it is possible for a resident to comply with both sets of regulations.|$|E
25|$|The perception, {{more than}} the reality, of science fiction series being {{cancelled}} <b>unreasonably</b> is greatly increased by the attachment of fans to their favorite series, which is much stronger in science fiction fandom {{than it is in}} the general population. While mainstream shows are often more strictly episodic, where ending shows can allow viewers to imagine that characters live happily, or at least normally, ever after, science fiction series generate questions and loose ends that, when unresolved, cause dissatisfaction among devoted viewers. Creative settings also often call for broader story arcs than is often found in mainstream television, requiring science fiction series many episodes to resolve an ongoing major conflict. Science fiction television producers will sometimes end a season with a dramatic cliffhanger episode to attract viewer interest, but the short-term effect rarely influences financial partners. Dark Angel is one of many shows ending with a cliffhanger scene that left critical questions open when the series was cancelled.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{a lawsuit}} exposed a {{possible}} family feud over the chain's corporate leadership. Richard Boyd, one of In-N-Out's vice presidents and co-trustee of {{two-thirds of the}} company stock, accused Lynsi Martinez and allied corporate executives of trying to force out Esther Snyder and attempting to fire Boyd <b>unreasonably.</b> Pre-empting the suit, Martinez, Snyder and Taylor appeared in a December video message to employees, telling them not to believe everything they hear. The company then responded with a lawsuit of its own, alleging Boyd had construction work done on his personal property and charged it to the company, as well as favoring contractors with uncompetitive bids. Boyd was then suspended from his role as co-trustee and Northern Trust Bank of California took his place (as co-trustee) until a hearing set for May 10, 2006. However, in April, the judge dismissed two of In-N-Out's claims against Boyd. A trial date of October 17, 2006, was set but never occurred, and a settlement was reached out of court. Ultimately, Boyd was permanently removed from his role as an employee and co-trustee.|$|E
25|$|Each vdev {{that the}} user defines, is {{completely}} independent from every other vdev, so {{different types of}} vdev can be mixed arbitrarily in a single ZFS system. If data redundancy is required (so that data is protected against physical device failure), then this is ensured by the user when they organize devices into vdevs, either by using a mirrored vdev or a RaidZ vdev. Data on a single device vdev may be lost if the device develops a fault. Data on a mirrored or RaidZ vdev will only be lost if enough disks fail {{at the same time}} (or before the system has resilvered any replacements due to recent disk failures). A ZFS vdev will continue to function in service if it is capable of providing at least one copy of the data stored on it, although it may become slower due to error fixing and resilvering, as part of its self-repair and data integrity processes. However ZFS is designed to not become <b>unreasonably</b> slow due to self-repair (unless directed to do so by an administrator) since one of its goals is to be capable of uninterrupted continual use even during self checking and self repair.|$|E
25|$|In 485 Zeno sent a fresh army {{against the}} rebels, which {{was said to}} have {{consisted}} of Macedonians and Scythians (Tillemont speculates, not <b>unreasonably,</b> that these were Ostrogoths) under John the Hunchback, or, more probably, John the Scythian, and Theodoric the Amal, who was at this time consul. John defeated the rebels near Seleucia (which town of that name is not clear, perhaps the Isaurian Seleucia) and drove them into the fort of Papurius where he blockaded them. In this difficulty Trocondus attempted to escape and gather forces for their relief, but was taken by the besiegers and put to death. Illus and Leontius were ignorant of his fate, and, encouraged by Pamprepius who gave them assurances of Troconcus's return and of ultimate victory, held out with great tenacity for over three years. In the fourth year the death of Trocondus was discovered, and Illus, enraged at the deceit practised on him by Pamprepius, put him to death. The fort was soon after taken by the treachery of Trocondus's brother-in-law, who had been sent for the purpose from Constantinople by Zeno, and Illus and Leontius were beheaded (488) and their heads sent to the emperor.|$|E
