C-, L-, and P-band data acquired by the JPL AIRSAR in the Beaufort sea was <b>used.</b> <b>Classification</b> <b>using</b> the unsupervised Wishart classifier is a twostage process. An initial classification is required to seed the algorithm and can be derived <b>using</b> other <b>classification</b> methods. The Wishart classifier then used in iterations where the class means are updated after every step. The convergence {{of this approach is}} investigated. The Wishart classifier was found to be extremely dominant so that the classification result after a few iterations depends not necessarily on the initial <b>classification</b> <b>used</b> to derive the first class means. Even an initial classification derived with a random number generator leads to a good result after a few iterations. I...|$|R

The estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) and subsequently plant water requirements in urban vegetation needs {{to consider the}} heterogeneity of plants, soils, water, and climate characteristics.

The other is a remote sensing approach based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on the Terra satellite. Both methods require knowledge of reference ET calculated from meteorological data. More information is available in: ...|$|E
