5|$|Several {{short-lived}} {{buildings were}} later constructed {{on top of}} the motte. The first of these {{around the turn of the}} 19th century was a banqueting house constructed by Lord Stafford. In 1808 Marquess of Landsdowne built a mansion in a Gothic style {{on top of the}} motte <b>using</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stone remains of the old keep; it became known as Landsdowne Castle, providing famous views across the town. Landsdowne Castle was pulled down in either 1815 or 1818, and most of the motte was subsequently flattened.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{marriage}} and children, Walter Jones reportedly had a wandering eye. On April 18, he met Sharon Kinne when {{she bought a}} Ford Thunderbird from his dealership <b>using</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insurance payout from her husband's death, and the two began an affair shortly thereafter. Kinne viewed him as a prospect for a second husband, but Jones was uninterested in leaving his wife despite the rockiness of their relationship. When he declined {{to go on a}} trip to Washington with her in May, Kinne reluctantly went with her brother instead. Although the couple reunited on May 25, shortly after Kinne returned to Missouri, the relationship was quickly set on the rocks when Kinne told Jones that she was pregnant and he was the father of the baby. Jones, instead of responding with what Kinne expected to be an agreement to divorce his wife, ended the affair.|$|E
5|$|Stafford {{moved from}} New York to California in November 1946, {{continuing}} to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances {{on the show}} to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested <b>using</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student. The annual Jo Stafford Prize for American Folklore was handled by the American Folklore Society, with the first prize of $250 awarded in 1949.|$|E

5|$|The SABRE engine design aims {{to avoid}} the {{historic}} weight-performance issue by <b>using</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid hydrogen fuel to cool helium within a closed-cycle precooler, which quickly reduces {{the temperature of the}} air at the inlet. The air is then used for combustion in a similar manner to a conventional jet engine; once the helium has left the pre-cooler, it is further heated by the products of the pre-burner, giving it enough energy to drive the turbine and the liquid hydrogen pump. As a consequence of the air being cooled at all speeds, the jet can be built of light alloys and the weight is roughly halved. Additionally, more fuel can be burnt at high speeds. Beyond Mach5.5, the air would normally become unusably hot despite the cooling; accordingly, the air inlet is closed upon attaining this speed and the engine instead is solely fed via on-board liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel, as in a traditional rocket.|$|E

25|$|In June 2010, the Australian Competition Tribunal {{ruled that}} FMG would be granted access to Rio Tinto's Robe River line and BHP Billiton's Goldsworthy line {{but not to}} the busier Hamersley and Mount Newman lines. Treasurer Wayne Swan {{suggested}} that several advantages would accrue from access to the rail lines by third parties. It would increase competition, reduce duplication of infrastructure, and reduce environmental damage. Atlas Iron, another junior iron ore miner, is hopeful {{to come to terms with}} BHP Billiton in regards to <b>using</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's rail infrastructure, the Goldsworthy railway, in the future.

25|$|The three set up {{a company}} called the Tongariro Timber Company Limited with the {{intention}} to construct the railway and to have branch lines heading into the bush at various points along the route to harvest the native timber along the way.

It was agreed that the land would remain in Maori ownership and that the Tongariro Timber Company Limited would operate the railway. Once the railway was built the company would carry freight other than timber, such as dressed flax and grain, and passengers at Government rates. The railway would connect with a ferry service on Lake Taupo.|$|E
25|$|The {{battlefield}} was a {{scene of}} widespread destruction, covered with dead men and animals. The Chancellor family, whose house was destroyed during the battle, placed the entire 854-acre property for sale {{four months after the}} battle. A smaller version of the house was rebuilt <b>using</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original materials, which served as a landmark for many of the veteran reunions of the late 19th century. In 1927, the rebuilt house was destroyed by fire. That same year, the United States Congress authorized the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park, which preserves some of the land that saw fighting in the 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg, the Chancellorsville Campaign, the Battle of the Wilderness, and the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House (the latter two being key battles in the 1864 Overland Campaign).|$|E
