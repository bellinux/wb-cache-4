40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging {{findings}} of cerebellar cortical dysplasia {{have been described}} as a new cerebellar malformation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the association of cerebellar cortical dysplasia with other cerebral malformations. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 46 MR examinations of patients presenting with developmental delay, hypotonia, and facial deformities to identify abnormal folia or fissures or both within cerebellar hemispheres or vermis suggesting cortical dysplasia. RESULTS: Cerebellar cortical dysplasia was diagnosed in 17 patients. In two patients, it was isolated. In the remaining 15 patients, the malformation was associated with vermian malfor-mation (n 511), cerebral cortical dysplasias (n 58), dysplasia of corpus callosum (n 56), and heterotopia (n 55). A widespread malformation of the posterior fossa was observed in eight patients (Dandy-Walker, Chiari II and III, and hypoplasia of brain stem). One patient with hypertrophied cerebellar hemisphere had minor enlargement of the right cerebral hemisphere and lateral ventricle. He also had nodular heterotopia, suggesting <b>unilateral</b> <b>megalencephaly.</b> CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that cerebellar cortical dysplasias are common in cases with more widespread cerebral malformations.
