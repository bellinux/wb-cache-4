It {{is a product of}} the breakdown of ibotenic acid by <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation.</b> Muscazone is of minor pharmacological activity compared with the other agents. Amanita muscaria and related species are known as effective bioaccumulators of vanadium; some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to 400 times those typically found in plants. Vanadium is present in fruit-bodies as an organometallic compound called amavadine. The biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Humans, horses, and orangutans {{are among}} the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are {{believed}} to have lost their fur 2.5–3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, to protect against <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair). The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).|$|E

25|$|In 1852, in {{his famous}} paper on the change of {{wavelength}} of light, he described the phenomenon of fluorescence, as exhibited by fluorspar and uranium glass, materials which he viewed as having the power to convert invisible <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiation</b> into radiation of longer wavelengths that are visible. The Stokes shift, which describes this conversion, is named in Stokes' honour. A mechanical model, illustrating the dynamical principle of Stokes's explanation was shown. The offshoot of this, Stokes line, {{is the basis of}} Raman scattering. In 1883, during a lecture at the Royal Institution, Lord Kelvin said he had heard an account of it from Stokes many years before, and had repeatedly but vainly begged him to publish it.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{acceleration}} of a climate model known as the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The use of Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) to accelerate scientific applications that are computationally intensive is well known. This work attempts to extract the performance of GPUs to enable faster execution of CESM and obtain better model throughput. We focus on two major routines that consume the largest amount of time namely, radabs and radcswmx, which compute parameters related to the long wave (infra-red) and short wave (visible and <b>ultra-violet)</b> <b>radiations</b> respectively. We propose a novel asynchronous execution strategy in which the results computed by the GPU for the current time step are used by the CPU in the subsequent time step. Such a technique effectively hides computational effort on the GPU. By exploiting the parallelism offered by the GPU and using asynchronous executions on the CPU and GPU, we obtain a speed-up of about 26 × for the routine radabs and about 5. 6 × for routine radcswmx.

40|$|Say'S grain bug (Chlorochroa sayi Stal) {{has been}} a {{recurrent}} pest in the southwestern states for some years, {{but it was not}} until 1932 that this insect was found in Montana in appreciable numbers, and from there the infestation probably spread into Alberta in 1934 and 1933. Since that time the insect has been spreading steadily northward, and in some localities has apparently become established in abundance. The results of field observations on the hibernation of adults, oviposition, seasonal habits of nymphs and adults, host plants, proportion of sexes, and number of generations are given in this paper. These observations are supplemented by experiments with all stages of the insect at controlled temperatures. Experiments on the effect of <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiations</b> on the change of color and resumption of activity are fully described. Notes are given on the parasites and predators affecting C. sayi Stal. both in the older areas of occurrence and in Alberta.

The comet and its induced magnetic field form an obstacle to outward flowing solar wind particles.

50|$|The {{wavelength}} {{at which}} the radiation is strongest is given by Wien's displacement law, and the overall power emitted per unit area is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. So, as temperature increases, the glow color changes from red to yellow to white to blue.

40|$|Quantum dots {{transparent}} display (QDs-TPD) was realized using {{a liquid}} QDs layer and N 2 barrier discharge panel. In the N 2 discharge, the 2 nd+ lines of N 2 {{in the range}} of 300 - 400 nm (C 3 Πu – B 3 Πg), and the 1 st- lines of N 2 + at 391. 4 and 427. 8 nm (B 2 Σu+ - X 2 Σg+) were mainly observed, while the visible emission lines were rarely observed. This implies the N 2 discharge is suitable for the excitation source of the QDs, due to the strong <b>ultra-violet</b> <b>radiations</b> and the weak visible emissions. The emission centers for red, green, and blue color in QDs-TPD were positioned at 452, 540, and 638 nm, respectively, and the N 2 emission peaks were seldom observed in the visible region. The transmittance of QDs-TPD was approximately 40 % in the visible region and the luminescence was about 70 cd/m 2. The CIE (x, y) coordinates of red, green, and blue colors were (0. 670, 0. 309), (0. 378, 0. 640), and (0. 183, 0. 118), respectively, and the color gamut was 71 % of a NTSC standard. Thus, the QDs-TPD is expected as a way for realizing the TPD, due to its good transparency, excellent visibility, wide viewing-angle, aesthetical design, low cost production, and good scalability to large sizes...|$|R
