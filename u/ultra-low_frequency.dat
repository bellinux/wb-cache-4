50|$|Sergei Kopeikin (born April 10, 1956) is a USSR-born {{theoretical}} physicist presently {{living and}} working in the United States, where he holds the position of Professor of Physics at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. He specializes in the theoretical and experimental study of gravity and general relativity. He is also an expert in the field of the astronomical reference frames and time metrology. His general relativistic theory of the Post-Newtonian reference frames which he had worked out along with Victor A. Brumberg, was adopted in 2000 by the resolutions of the International Astronomical Union as a standard for reduction of ground-based astronomical observation. A computer program Tempo2 used to analyze radio observations of pulsars, includes several effects predicted by S. Kopeikin that are important for measuring parameters of the binary pulsars, for testing general relativity, and for detection of gravitational waves of <b>ultra-low</b> <b>frequency.</b> In September 2002, S. Kopeikin led a team which conducted a high-precision VLBI experiment to measure the fundamental speed of gravity, thus, confirming the invariance of the gravitational field under the Lorentz transformation. He is also involved in studies concerning the capabilities of the Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) technique to measure dynamical features of the General Theory of Relativity in the lunar motion. He has critically analyzed the claims of other scientists concerning the possibility of LLR to measure the gravitomagnetic interaction. Prof. Kopeikin organized and chaired three international workshops on the advanced theory and model of the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment.

40|$|International audiencePrevious {{observations}} {{with the}} Goose Bay HF coherent-scatter radar have revealed structured spectral peaks at <b>ultra-low</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The frequencies of these spectral peaks {{have been demonstrated}} to be extremely consistent from day to day. The stability of these spectral peaks {{can be seen as}} evidence for the existence of global magnetospheric cavity modes whose resonant frequencies are independent of latitude. Field-line resonances occur when successive harmonics of the eigenfrequency of the magnetospheric cavity or waveguide match either the first harmonic eigenfrequency of the geomagnetic field lines or higher harmonics of this frequency. Power spectra observed at the SABRE VHF coherent-scatter radar at Wick, Scotland, during night and early morning are revealed to show similarly clearly structured spectral peaks. These spectral peaks are the result of local field-line resonances due to Alfvén waves standing on magnetospheric field lines. A comparison of the spectra observed by the Goose Bay and Wick radars demonstrate that the frequencies of the field-line resonances are, on average, almost identical, despite the different latitudinal ranges covered by the two radars. Possible explanations for the similarity of the signatures on the two radar systems are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{sheet metal}} forming there is an {{increasing}} demand for deep drawing of light weight components with complex shapes. However, thinner and more ductile materials {{are more susceptible to}} tearing during the process. It is known that greater draw depths can be achieved without tearing if the blankholder is subjected to a pulsating force. The present paper describes experimental investigations in which cylindrical-shaped cups are drawn with a pulsed blankholder force (PBHF) at ultra-low (< 1 Hz) and low (1 - 10 Hz) frequencies. The tests were performed with blanks of steel (DC 04) and of aluminium (5754 -H 111) over a range of draw ratios. The tests showed that tearing occurred within a well-defined part of the punch stroke. Of the two parameters, amplitude and frequency of the pulsed force, the latter had a more pronounced effect. For draw ratios resulting in a narrow working range of the static blankholder force, the process can be made more robust if the PBHF is applied at <b>ultra-low</b> <b>frequencies.</b> In addition to this, the PBHF must be synchronised in such a way that, during the identified critical tearing part of the stroke, the instantaneous PBHF is kept below the static tearing limit by synchronising the punch force and PBHF.

40|$|Resting state-fMRI {{studies have}} found that the inter-areal {{correlations}} in cortical networks concentrate within <b>ultra-low</b> <b>frequencies</b> (0. 01 – 0. 04 Hz) while long-distance connections within subcortical networks distribute over a wider frequency range (0. 01 – 0. 14 Hz). However, the frequency characteristics of regional homogeneity (ReHo) in different areas are still unclear. To examine the ReHo properties in different frequency bands, a data-driven method, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), was adopted to decompose the time series of each voxel into several components with distinct frequency bands. ReHo values in each of the components were then calculated. Our results showed that ReHo in cortical areas were higher and more frequency-dependent than those in the subcortical regions. BOLD oscillations of 0. 02 – 0. 04 Hz mainly contributed to the cortical ReHo, whereas the ReHo in limbic areas involved a wider frequency range and were dominated by higher-frequency BOLD oscillations (. 0. 08 Hz). The frequency characteristics of ReHo are distinct between different parts of the striatum, with the frequency band of 0. 04 – 0. 1 Hz contributing the most to ReHo in caudate nucleus, and oscillations lower than 0. 02 Hz contributing more to ReHo in putamen. The distinct frequency-specific ReHo properties of different brain areas may arise from the assorted cytoarchitecture or synaptic types in these areas. Our work may advance the understanding of the neural-physiological basis of local BOLD activities and the functional specificity of different brain regions...|$|R

40|$|A new {{detection}} method for <b>ultra-low</b> <b>frequency</b> gravitational waves (GWs) with a frequency {{much lower than}} the observational range of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) was suggested in Yonemaru et al. (2016). In the PTA analysis, <b>ultra-low</b> <b>frequency</b> GWs (≲ 10 ^- 10 Hz) which evolve just linearly during the observation time span are absorbed by the pulsar spin-down rates since both have the same effect on the pulse arrival time. Therefore, such GWs cannot be detected by the conventional method of PTAs. However, the bias on the observed spin-down rates depends on relative direction of a pulsar and GW source and shows a quadrupole pattern in the sky. Thus, if we divide the pulsars according to the position in the sky and see the difference in the statistics of the spin-down rates, <b>ultra-low</b> <b>frequency</b> GWs from a single source can be detected. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of this method by Monte-Carlo simulations and estimate the sensitivity. We find that with 3, 000 milli-second pulsars, which are expected to be discovered by a future survey with the Square Kilometre Array, GWs with the derivative of amplitude of about 3 × 10 ^- 19 s^- 1 can be detected.

BackgroundAlthough altered nonlinear heart rate dynamics predicts death {{in patients with}} coronary artery disease (CAD), its prognostic value in chronic hemodialysis patients with CAD is unknown. MethodsWe analyzed 24 -hour electrocardiogram for nonlinear heart rate dynamics and heart rate variability in a retrospective cohort of 81 chronic hemodialysis patients with CAD. ResultsDuring a follow-up period of 31 ± 20 months, 19 cardiac and 8 noncardiac deaths were observed. Cox hazards model, including diabetes, left ventricular ejection fraction, {{and the number of}} diseased coronary arteries, revealed that abnormal α 2 (defined as both increase and decrease in α 2 because of its J curve relationship with cardiac mortality), decreased approximate entropy and decreased heart rate variability (triangular index and <b>ultra-low</b> <b>frequency</b> power) were significant and independent predictors of cardiac death. No significant and independent predictive power for noncardiac death was observed in either the heart rate dynamics or the heart rate variability measures. The predictive power of α 2 and approximate entropy was independent of that of triangular index and <b>ultra-low</b> <b>frequency</b> power.

Silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) ring resonators open up capabilities for optical routing, frequency comb generation, optical clocks and high precision sensing on an integrated platform. However, simultaneously achieving high quality factor and high confinement in Si 3 N 4 (critical for nonlinear processes for example) remains a challenge.

We show a clear systematic path for achieving these high quality factors.
