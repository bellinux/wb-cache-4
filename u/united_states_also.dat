5|$|A legal {{claim of}} {{discrimination}} rests upon a group agreeing {{that a particular}} term or practice is offensive, thus opponents of mascot change often point to individuals claiming Native American heritage {{who say they are}} not offended.

5|$|Abolitionists, notably William Wilberforce, {{continued}} {{their effort to}} end the slave trade. Britain passed the Slave Trade Act 1807, which prohibited the Atlantic slave trade, and the Royal Navy enforced the Blockade of Africa. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>also</b> prohibited the Atlantic slave trade in 1808 and helped intercept illegal slave ships at sea, predominately after 1842.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, the United States was {{completing}} a retreat from Vietnam. A staunchly anti-communist Indonesia was {{considered by the}} United States to be an essential counterweight, and friendly relations with the Indonesian government were considered {{more important than a}} decolonisation process in East Timor.

During this time, Pratap and Hentig met with Enver Pasha and enjoyed an audience with the Sultan. On Enver Pasha's orders, a Turkish officer, Lieutenant Kasim Bey, was deputed to the expedition as the Turkish representative, bearing official letters addressed to the Afghan Emir and the Indian princely states. Two Afghans from the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>also</b> joined the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>also</b> observes tribal {{sovereignty}} of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they {{have a great deal of}} autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.|$|E
5|$|The United States was {{represented}} by Louis F. Claiborne, assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>also</b> argued that the Menominee Termination Act did not extinguish hunting and fishing rights under the 1854 treaty and therefore the tribe was not due compensation from the United States. Claiborne also argued that whatever regulatory rights which were held {{by the federal government}} were transferred to the state of Wisconsin by the termination act.|$|E

5|$|Strongly {{affected}} by the deindustrialization {{that took place in}} other Rust Belt cities, Utica suffered a major reduction in manufacturing activity {{during the second half of}} the 20thcentury. The 1954 opening of the New York State Thruway (which bypassed the city) and declines in activity on the Erie Canal and railroads throughout the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>also</b> contributed to a poor local economy. During the 1980s and 1990s, major employers such as General Electric and Lockheed Martin began to close plants in Utica and Syracuse.|$|E
5|$|The NBC radio crew {{aboard the}} lead bomber made its live {{broadcast}} coast-to-coast as the bombers flew by the Rex. The Army's low-altitude photographs were featured {{the next day}} {{on the front pages}} of hundreds of newspapers. Eaker exploited a trust of Americans in radio broadcasts and in photography, particular to that era, to bolster the credibility of Air Corps claims that air power was essential in defending the western hemisphere. In addition to the Rex episode, the May 1938 maneuvers conducted a well-publicized mock attack on New York City, and arranged the first voluntary blackout in the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>also</b> planned by Eaker, during a mock raid on Farmingdale, New York, on 16 May.|$|E
5|$|The {{corn earworm}} {{is found in}} {{temperate}} and tropical regions of North America, {{with the exception of}} northern Canada and Alaska as it cannot overwinter in these areas. Helicoverpa zea found in the eastern <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>also</b> does not overwinter successfully. They live in Kansas, Ohio, Virginia, and southern New Jersey, but survival rate is mainly affected by the severity of the winter. Corn earworm moths regularly migrate from southern regions to northern regions depending on winter conditions. They are also found in Hawaii, the Caribbean islands, and most of South America, including Peru, Argentina, and Brazil.|$|E

5|$|The {{third phase}} of the {{campaign}} was heavily favored by U.S. commanders, because it allowed them to destroy rather than just threaten Hanoi’s nascent industrial infrastructures. Furthermore, the new targets approved by the Johnson administration enabled U.S. airpower to be used against the primary war-making capabilities of North Vietnam, by striking at military targets that were previously denied to the fighter-bombers of the U.S. Navy and Air Force. Thus, in 1967 the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>also</b> introduced more aircraft into the operation equipped with new technology, which gave American air units the assets to make a significant difference. However, as American bombers moved closer to Hanoi and Hai Phong, they were aggressively challenged by North Vietnamese MiG fighters.|$|E
5|$|Both Germany and the United States have {{developed}} several other rounds. These include the German DM12 multi-purpose anti-tank projectile (MPAT), {{based on the}} technology in a high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead. However, {{it has been found}} that the DM12's armor-killing abilities are limited by the lack of blast and fragmentation effects, and that the round is less valuable against lightly armored targets. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>also</b> has a MPAT type projectile, known as the M830. This was later developed into the M830A1, which allows the M1 Abrams to use the round against helicopters. The M1 Abrams can use the M1028 canister round, which is an anti-personnel/anti-helicopter munition, packed with over 1,000 tungsten balls. The United States Armed Forces accepted a new demolition round, called the M908 Obstacle Defeating Round, based on the M830A1 MPAT, but with the proximity fuse replaced by a hardened nose cap. The cap allows the round to impact and embed itself in concrete, then exploding inside the target and causing more damage.|$|E
5|$|In the European Union, animal {{sources are}} governed by Council Directive 86/609/EEC, which {{requires}} lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported {{and is not a}} wild animal or a stray. The latter requirement may also be exempted by special arrangement. In 2010 the Directive was revised with EU Directive 2010/63/EU. In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>also</b> allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Over half the primates imported between 1995 and 2000 were handled by Charles River Laboratories, or by Covance, which is the single largest importer of primates into the U.S.|$|E
