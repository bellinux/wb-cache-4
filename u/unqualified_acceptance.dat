6000|$|Something {{turned up}} the very next day: our young man, taken at his word, found himself indebted to the postman for a note of concise intimation that the high {{position}} of minister to the smallest of Central American republics would be apportioned him. The republic, though small, {{was big enough to}} be [...] "shaky," [...] and the position, though high, not so exalted that there were not much greater altitudes above it to which it was a stepping-stone. Peter, quite ready to take one thing with another, rejoiced at his easy triumph, reflected that he must have been even more noticed at headquarters than he had hoped, and, on the spot, consulting nobody and waiting for nothing, signified his <b>unqualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the place. Nobody with a grain of sense would have advised him to do anything else. It made him happier than he had supposed he should ever be again; it made him feel professionally in the train, as they said in Paris; it was serious, it was interesting, it was exciting, and his imagination, letting itself loose into the future, began once more to scale the crowning eminence. It was very simple to hold one's course if one really tried, and he blessed the variety of peoples. Further communications passed, the last enjoining on him to return to Paris for a short interval a week later, after which he would be advised of the date for his proceeding to his remoter duties.|$|E
6000|$|In the {{concluding}} {{pages of his}} great systematic work, M. Comte had announced four other treatises as in contemplation: on Politics; on the Philosophy of Mathematics; on Education, a project subsequently enlarged to include the systematization of Morals; and on Industry, or the action of man upon external nature. Our list comprises the only two of these which he lived to execute. It further contains a brief exposition of his final doctrines, {{in the form of}} a Dialogue, or, as he terms it, a Catechism, of which a translation has been published by his principal English adherent, Mr Congreve. There has also appeared very recently, under the title of [...] "A General View of Positivism," [...] a translation by Dr Bridges, of the Preliminary Discourse in six chapters, prefixed to the Système de Politique Positive. The remaining three books on our list are the productions of disciples in different degrees. M. Littré, the only thinker of established reputation who accepts that character, is a disciple only of the Cours de Philosophie Positive, and can see the weak points even in that. Some of them he has discriminated and discussed with great judgment: and the merits of his volume, both as a sketch of M. Comte's life and an appreciation of his doctrines, would well deserve a fuller notice than we are able to give it here. M. de Blignières is a far more thorough adherent; so much so, that the reader of his singularly well and attractively written condensation and popularization of his master's doctrines, does not easily discover in what it falls short of that <b>unqualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> which alone, it would seem, could find favour with M. Comte. For he ended by casting off M. de Blignières, as he had previously cast off M. Littré, and every other person who, having gone with him a certain length, refused to follow him to the end. The author of the last work in our enumeration, Dr Robinet, is a disciple after M. Comte's own heart; one whom no difficulty stops, and no absurdity startles. But it is far from our disposition to speak otherwise than respectfully of Dr Robinet and the other earnest men, who maintain round the tomb of their master an organized co-operation for the diffusion of doctrines which they believe destined to regenerate the human race. Their enthusiastic veneration for him, and devotion to the ends he pursued, do honour alike to them and to their teacher, and are an evidence of the personal ascendancy he exercised over those who approached him; an ascendancy which for a time carried away even M. Littré, as he confesses, to a length which his calmer judgment does not now approve.|$|E

5000|$|Justice Souter {{delivered}} the unanimous {{opinion of the}} court on June 19, 1995. He reasoned that, even though the Council {{did not have a}} narrow, set message that it was intending to convey, the parade nevertheless constituted a message that the Council had a right to protect. Noting that the Council had been fairly unrestrictive in its guidelines for determining which groups to allow to participate in the parade, he said this did not necessarily mean that the Council waived its right to present its message in a way it saw fit. He wrote: [...] "One important manifestation of the principle of free speech is that one who chooses to speak may also decide what not to say". GLIB's attorney, John Ward of Gay & Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, had argued that a banner identifying GLIB by its full name carried no [...] "extrinsic message" [...] and therefore was not speech that could interfere with the parade sponsors' speech rights. Souter interpreted the banner as an attempt to [...] "bear witness to the fact that some Irish are gay, lesbian, or bisexual" [...] who [...] "have as much claim to <b>unqualified</b> social <b>acceptance</b> as heterosexuals and indeed as members of parade units organized around other identifying characteristics". Of primary concern to the Court was the fact that anyone observing the parade could rationally believe that those involved in the parade were all part of an overriding message the Council was seeking to provide. Souter wrote that the Council could not statutorily be prohibited from excluding the messages of groups it did not agree with, nor could it be forced to endorse a message against its will.|$|R
6000|$|Isabel awoke, fully {{conscious}} of the day just dawning. From her bed in the half-open sleeping porch she peered into a roseate east. With her whole heart {{she went out to}} meet the sun, slowly lifting from a rampart of dark mountains. This was Isabel's wedding day. At high noon she was to be married to Philip Barry. She rested on her elbow, waiting for the transcendent moment. She was a [...] "sun worshiper" [...] for the time, and not a cloud subdued the oncoming spectacle. As Isabel watched, the sable range took on softest blue, while snow-crowned peaks rose dazzling in the distance. Over the world the sun poured light. And this was her wedding day. It was still too early for a bath, too soon to begin her simple bridal toilet, and she fell back on the pillow. The white broadcloth gown and coat with feather-trimmed hat were ready, and the night before Philip had brought a bouquet of dewy-eyed forget-me-nots. She had chosen the flowers in preference to all others. There was very little to do, no more than for an afternoon call. She smiled over enjoined simplicity, glad that neither bridesmaids nor guests should claim thoughts which might all belong to Philip. During the past two months in which she had spent a part of each day with her lover, she had grown confident; they were both happy. Isabel no longer feared for the man beginning his fresh career. For his book--at last finished--had been sent to an Eastern publisher. Philip had not heard definitely, but there was {{reason to believe that the}} house in question would be glad to bring out a finely illustrated work on cathedrals which might readily appeal to a cultured class of readers. Already Isabel felt elated over her lover's beginning. The field of letters seemed more choice, more set apart, since Philip had decided to compete for honors. In imagination she saw her future husband's prolific volumes. How proudly she would dust the dark green row marked [...] "Barry." [...] She remembered that the name was preëmpted by a master Scotch novelist, and decided that [...] "Philip Barry" [...] should appear in full on the backs of the new author's uniform edition. She had read only parts of her lover's work, but it had been exciting to handle a real manuscript, one which must go forth to win! Philip alone understood the uncertain odds against disappointment. In a fight for fresh life he felt no desire for anything but honest work. The book had started upon a journey East a month before, and now each day Isabel watched her lover's face for news of its <b>unqualified</b> <b>acceptance.</b> The collection of exquisite cathedral views--actual paintings--done in Paris and submitted by a noted artist, would doubtless enhance the value of the work, yet it was, after all, Philip's part which timed the woman's heart to feverish interest. And to-day was her wedding day. From now on the book and its author were both hers. She stirred lightly in bed, again looking through the open flaps of her canvas room. A wonderful world was at last awake. Every bird evoked gladness, and Isabel too was glad. Then suddenly the boy slipped from his cot to snuggle within her arms. Enchantment of sleep lurked around his dewy eyes, and night had brushed his rounded cheeks with cool, fresh bloom. He kissed his mother again and again. [...] "You've got most a bushel!" [...] he cried. [...] "Now I is going to love you." [...] He was speaking more plainly each day, gradually ceasing to be a baby. [...] "I like to stay with mother dear--in this nice bed," [...] he said, contentedly. His arms held tighter. The mother's heart felt chill; she seemed to be turning the boy away. The child's words hurt her as she had never dreamed they could. She began to speak of a pony about to arrive, which she had purposely withheld against a trying time to come. [...] "To-day is the day for the pony!" [...] she announced bravely. [...] "Mother's boy is to go out in his new cart with madame, is to drive like a man all afternoon." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{majority}} of U.S. Catholics hold views {{that differ from}} the official Church doctrine on abortion.

According to a 2016 survey by Pew Research Center, 51% of U.S. Catholics say that [...] "having an abortion is morally wrong." [...] Surveys conducted {{by a number of}} polling organizations indicate that between 16% and 22% of American Catholic voters agree with Church policy that abortion should be illegal in all cases; the rest of the respondents held positions ranging from support for legal abortions in certain restricted circumstances to an <b>unqualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> of abortion in all cases. According to a 2009 survey by Pew Research Center, 47% of American Catholics believe that abortion should be legal in [...] "all or most cases", while 42% of American Catholics believe that abortion should be illegal in [...] "all or most cases". When posed the binary question of whether abortion was acceptable or unacceptable, rather than a question of whether it should be allowed or not allowed in all or most cases, according to polls conducted in 2006-2008 by Gallup, 40% of American Catholics said it was acceptable, approximately the same percentage as non-Catholics. According to the National Catholic Reporter, some 58% of American Catholic women feel {{that they do not have}} to follow the abortion teaching of their bishop.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} was to explore and gain insight into the sentiments surrounding tooth loss {{in a group of}} edentulous Saudis. Materials and Methods: Using a qualitative methodology, 44 edentulous patients who were receiving complete denture treatment were interviewed in private, in the Arabic language. Interviews were tape recorded and semistructured, following a list of predetermined and piloted topics, but dialogue also took place, with the freedom for both interviewer and interviewee to explore areas of interest. All recordings were transcribed, translated into English, and interpreted independently by two members of the team to identify the core themes associated with tooth loss. Results: The mean age of participants was 58. 9 years (range 35 to 72 years), and they had been edentulous for a mean of 7. 1 years (range 3 months to 22 years). The main themes related to tooth loss were <b>unqualified</b> <b>acceptance,</b> inevitability with old age, behavior changes with respect to eating comfort, aged appearance, self-responsibility, positively perceived benefits, high prosthetic expectations and reduced level of denture satisfaction, and some need for privacy. Conclusion: The lack of any outward indication that participants experienced bereavement suggests that outlook on life can influence the impact of tooth loss. Participants’ <b>unqualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> of their edentulous fate, yet their clear need to “normalize” oral function, reflects a degree of pragmatism toward life events. The strong influence of religion in Saudi society is a possible factor in the sentiments expressed. King Saud Universit...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a comparative laboratory study between well- and gap-graded aggregates used in asphalt concrete paving mixtures. A total of 424 batches of asphalt concrete mixtures and 3, 960 Marshall and Hveem specimens were examined. There is strong evidence from this investigation that, with proper combinations of aggregates and asphalts, both continuous- and gap-graded aggregates can produce mixtures of high density and of qualities meeting current design criteria. There is also {{reason to believe that the}} <b>unqualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> of some supposedly desirable, constant, mathematical relationship between adjacent particle sizes of the form such as Fuller's curve p = 100 (d/D) n is not justified. It is recommended that. the aggregate grading limits be relaxed or eliminated and that the acceptance or rejection of an aggregate for use in asphalt pavement be based on individual mixture evaluation. Furthermore, because of the potential attractiveness of gap-graded asphalt concrete in cost, quality, and skid and wear resistance, selected gap-graded mixtures are recommended for further tests both in the laboratory and in the field, especially in regard to ease of compaction and skid and wear resistance...|$|E
40|$|The {{observation}} that continued {{exposure of the}} heart muscle of aplysia to muscarine results {{in the development of}} tolerance for this drug formed the basis of the well known potential theory of drug action (1).

40|$|Closing Guantánamo {{presents}} a daunting challenge, both politically and practically. The detainees cannot be transferred readily to other locations abroad, and yet many commentators {{insist that they}} are too dangerous to be held within the United States.

Familiar rules and institutions, properly managed, possess ample resources to cope with the challenges of modern terrorism...|$|E
40|$|The study {{presented}} in this article looks at the reporting of eight issues of the Medical Journal of Australia in four Australian broadsheet newspapers: The Courier-Mail, the Canberra Times, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian. The purpose of the article is to explore and explain the translation of medical research into news reportage in major Australian newspapers. In her discussion of ideology and health reporting, Lupton (1992) notes that organisational structures in newsmaking can allow the voice of powerful elites (such as doctors) to be heard more strongly than that of others. In this study, published news stories are compared with the source articles in the Journal and the relationship between the medical professional and the journalists who report the stories is discussed in terms of the power given to the Journal and the authors of the articles. The transmission of the information from journal article to newspaper story is considered in terms of the gatekeeping chain and processes involved and the final message {{presented in}} the stories is analysed in terms of dominant topics and news themes. The study finds there are serious shortcomings in the reportage of medical research in the mainstream press. These stem from an over-reliance on news agency copy, a tendency to confuse medical research with individual doctors 2 ̆ 7 opinions, a deference to doctors as the primary authorities on health-related matters, an <b>unqualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> of their findings and a reluctance to provide readers with background material so that they may gauge the veracity of the research findings...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{traces the}} narcissistic {{dynamics}} behind mounting idealizations of a Native American Indian, Chief Seattle, and his renowned speech of 1854. In my work I draw from psychoanalytic, poststructuralist, 2 ̆ 7 post-colonial 2 ̆ 7, and translation theories, {{as well as}} from contemporary Indian scholarship. I develop my own provisional model of what I term 2 ̆ 2 Narcissistic Drift 2 ̆ 2, providing a means of charting the intertextual dynamics driving colonial representations of otherness to converge progressively with stereotypical norms. Where previous Seattle studies have tended to concern themselves with issues of textual 2 ̆ 7 authenticity 2 ̆ 7, I build on such work to consider how an indigenous speech 2 ̆ 7 uprooted 2 ̆ 7 from its Native American contexts by the written word, has become vulnerable to fetishistic uses by colonial producers, as well as to growing universalist idealization in written and visual media. I resist such trends by re-positioning H. A. Smith 2 ̆ 7 s Seattle speech version of 1887, relative to traces of the 1854 oration 2 ̆ 7 s political and cultural contexts and codes of interpretation. I find that in Smith 2 ̆ 7 s speech version- despite its aestheticizing frame - {{there is a sense of}} agency and sophistication in the Salishan elder 2 ̆ 7 s rhetorical manouevrings. I argue that Seattle 2 ̆ 7 s dynamic position in judgement of the colonizers, located in-between absolute denial and <b>unqualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> of 2 ̆ 7 Red 2 ̆ 7 / 2 ̆ 7 White 2 ̆ 7 brotherhood, becomes erased by subsequent, increasingly assimilationist portrayals. I locate these idealizations of Seattle and his speech at a disempowering site placed across the West 2 ̆ 7 s most profound 2 ̆ 7 excluded middle 2 ̆ 7 - between 2 ̆ 7 Nature 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Culture 2 ̆ 7...|$|E
40|$|This is the (revised) {{introductory}} {{chapter of}} a book that I am currently writing. The book is titled Everyday Law for Gays and Lesbians, and is part of Paradigm Publishers 2 ̆ 7 Everyday Law series. The introductory chapter - indeed, the entire book - is built upon and around the power of narrative. I begin the chapter with a personal narrative that illustrates what I {{refer to as the}} current predicament of the lesbian and gay movement. In {{the first part of the}} chapter, I survey the social and legal landscape that surrounds the movement, explain why I view the current situation as a predicament, and consider the source of that predicament. Then, in the second part of the chapter, I set the stage - and the tone - for the remainder of the book by suggesting that the narratives of individual lesbians and gay men, told in their own words, are a radical and powerful tool for advancing us (meaning all lesbians and gay men) toward the <b>unqualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> that we seek. As I explain in the chapter, my goal in writing this book is to empower and inspire each of us to deploy these narratives in the most effective way possible. In keeping with this view of the power of the individual narrative, I counsel against relying on others - whether straight allies or lesbian and gay rights organizations - to effect change on our behalf. I argue that it is up to each of us to draw attention to and challenge the ubiquitous privileging of heterosexuality in our society. And, the title of the book and the series notwithstanding, I further eschew overreliance on legal strategies for effecting change; instead, in the course of the book, I discuss both potential legal and non-legal avenues for effecting change. I would greatly appreciate any comments that you might have on the chapter or any suggestions that you might have regarding coverage for the book...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether corporate social disclosure levels are determined by society. A social accounting methodology is applied, consisting of a hypothetico-deductive approach. Social accounting research is a critical or interpretative branch of financial accounting research. The main difference from financial accounting is the <b>unqualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> of a social reality by social accounting researchers. Empirical evidence is assessed with the application of a system-oriented theoretical framework. The theoretical framework consists of a combination of theories: Stakeholder Theory, Legitimacy Theory and institutions from Institutional Theory. Research questions are developed out of the theoretical framework, which are input for the development of hypotheses. Stakeholder Theory and Legitimacy Theory are both suggested to explain corporate social disclosure levels and its relation with economic institutions, social institutions and political institutions. Prior research supports the suggested relationships, especially studies that take a similar outside-in approach; these studies suggest outside effects on the internal corporate social disclosure decision. Corporate social disclosure data are provided by Sustainalytics, which are similar to the often-studied KLD social performance data. Economic institutional variables applied are of legal origin, as a determinant of corporate governance systems and freedom of markets. Social institutional variables applied are national culture dimensions and combined measures. Political variables applied are political and civil freedom, national environmental and labour law indices. The sample tested consists of 600 large corporations from 22 countries. The corporations are part of what is known as Morgan Stanley Capital International index. They are all large corporations. Statistical testing with the use of bivariate correlations, t-tests and multivariate regression models largely support the hypotheses suggested. The main conclusion is that corporate social disclosure levels are related to the way society is organised. The outcomes of the study show several confirmations of theoretically suggested relationships. Economic institutions are weakly related to corporate social disclosure levels on the basis of a stakeholder orientation of societies, or communitarianism. The relationships that were suggested by theory and some of the prior literature were weakly and partially confirmed. The found relationship between corporate social disclosure levels and governmentally supported freedom of markets can be explained by stakeholder theory, especially communitarianism. Another variable related to communitarianism, the distinction between legal origins, which describes corporate governance systems, is not found to be relevant to explain corporate social disclosure levels. Legitimacy issues certainly play a role as a determinant of corporate social disclosure levels, but not with regard to economic institutions. The relationship described between corporate social disclosure levels and national cultures is consistent with the associations suggested by stakeholder theory. Legitimacy has been related in the past mainly with corporate characteristics, company size, and sensitive industry membership. As this study only applies data on large corporations measured by market capitalisation, sensitive industry membership remains as the main relevant corporate legitimacy variable. The sensitive industry membership variable causes the models with social institutional variables to improve. Political institutions are related to corporate social disclosure levels, though differentiated. The relationship between freedom and corporate social disclosure levels is described by applying stakeholder theory. Stakeholder theory states that the influence that stakeholders can have on the corporation depends on the salience of their needs. The relationship is confirmed, as expected. Political institutions are related to the way corporations deal with legitimacy issues. Clear relations are found between corporate environmental disclosure levels and national environmental performance indices. A relationship between corporate employment disclosure levels and national employment law indices is difficult to confirm. A generally valid relationship between corporate social disclosure levels and political institutions is not clearly found. A general conclusion is that meso-level institutions have shown to be relevant determinants of corporate social disclosure levels. The systems-oriented framework is found to be applicable in explaining relationships between levels of corporate social disclosure and the institutional environment. The conclusion that societal, institutional determinants are relevant for corporate social disclosures implicitly supports the acceptance of a social reality of social accounting, as institutions are social by definition.
