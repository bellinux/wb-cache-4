30|$|Laboratory {{measurements}} of electrical conductivity of earth-forming materials {{provide the basis}} for interpreting magnetotelluric data. Silicates, including both nominally anhydrous and hydrous phases such as serpentines, are poor conductors, with a small polaron-type conduction mechanism that results in high temperature dependence, and typical conductivities lower than 10 − 3 – 10 − 4 S.m− 1 at temperatures of the forearc (Guo, et al. 2011; Reynard, et al. 2011). Brucite, a minor component of hydrated <b>ultrabasic</b> <b>rocks,</b> has a slightly higher conductivity, because conductivity occurs mainly by proton exchange (Fujita, et al. 2007), but is not abundant enough to explain high conductivity in hydrated <b>ultrabasic</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: The Ankara Melange {{consists}} {{from west}} to east of three major parallel belts: (i) metamorphic melange, (ii) limestone melange and (iii) ophiolitic melange. A Triassic age for the metamorphic and limestone belts and a Cretaceous age for the ophiolitic belt have been suggested by several authors (Norman 1973, ~apan 1981, Yilmazer 1981). The ophiolitic belt includes lenses of serpentinite, occasionally unserpentinized perido-tite, gabbro, pillow lava, agglomerate and basic dykes. The <b>ultrabasic</b> <b>rocks</b> show tectonic fabrics and the gabbros cumulate textures. The metamorphic and limestone melange belts contain basic volcanic rocks only as blocks, clasts and dykes, and are devoid of <b>ultrabasic</b> <b>rocks.</b> Petrochemical studies reveal that the volcanic rocks of the ophiolitic and metamorphic belts are very similar in mineralogical and chemical composition, including representatives of both the tholeiitic and calc-alkaline s ries.

Heavy metals are released to the soil during weathering and pedogenic processes. <b>Ultrabasic</b> <b>rocks</b> are known as the potential natural source of heavy metals, especially Ni, Cr and Mn in the soil. Average concentrations of Ni and Cr in the soils are 84 and 34 mg kg- 1, respectively; while, in soil derived from ultrabasic parent material, the concentration of these elements may reach up to 100000 mg kg- 1.

40|$|After the Connemara schists, of Dalradian age, {{had been}} folded (F 1) and metamorphosed to {{sillimanite}} grade, they were strongly hornfelsed by {{the intrusion of}} basic magma. From this magma crystallized peridotites, norites, pyroxenites and gabbros, all with An 80 – 87 plagioclase. Movements then caused the magma to break up these <b>ultrabasic</b> <b>rocks</b> and crystallization of basic rocks occurred. They are labradorite (An 55 – 65) -hornblende-relic clinopyroxene rocks that grade into quartz-hornblende-labradorite (An 55) -gneiss, quartz-hornblende-labradorite (An 55) - and andesine (An 40) -gneiss and quartz-andesine (An 40) -hornblende-biotite-gneiss. These gneisses formed during strong F 2 and F 3 movements, and probably during amphibolite-facies metamorphism, and they broke up, injected, metasomatized and amphibolized the earlier basic and <b>ultrabasic</b> <b>rocks,</b> giving a heterogeneous migmatite that commonly contains two plagioclases, An 40 and An 55. Quartzo-feldspath-ization of metasediment occurred, possibly up to {{a mile from the}} migmatites.

This migmatite complex contains evidence of both magmatic and metamorphic crystallization of hornblende and the relative importance of each process remains to be determined.
