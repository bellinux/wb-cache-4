40|$|The {{interaction}} {{of environmental and}} structural factors is explored in this case study of innovation in a junior high school. It is argued here that when diffuse or ambiguous environmental pressure for substantial change are combined with a differentiated structure, the frequent result is that organization participants develop vague, symbolic agreements.

Attempting to implement symbolic agreements then results in <b>unforeseen</b> <b>technical</b> difficulties and conflict, frequently leading to rejection of the innovation.

40|$|Political skill {{has been}} {{described}} as using human resources and manipulating social exchanges to influence group outcomes (Mintzberg, 1983). Researchers have found that political skill has significant relationships with constructs such as contextual performance, career satisfaction and leadership. Based on these empirical findings it may be beneficial to include a measure of political skill as part of a selection process. In this study, different methods were explored for measuring political skill that may be appropriate for administrative purposes such as the self-rated questionnaire called the Political Skill Inventory (PSI), a situational judgment test (SJT) and the structured interview. A sample of 100 graduate business students, most of whom had extensive managerial experience, completed the previously mentioned measures in exchange for feedback on their assessments. The participants were subsequently rated on political skill by their coworkers. The only significant association with the coworker scores was the PSI; neither the SJT nor the structured interview showed a significant relationship with the peer ratings of political skill. However, there were <b>unforeseen</b> <b>technical</b> limits to the measures that might explain the negative findings.

40|$|Toxicity Testing and Assessment of Environmental Agents) {{for future}} {{toxicity}} testing involves {{the testing of}} human cells in in vitro assays for “toxicity pathways”—normal signaling pathways that when perturbed can lead to adverse effects. Risk assessments would eventually be conducted using mathematical models of toxicity pathways (TP models) to estimate exposures that will not cause biologically significant perturbations in these pathways. Objectives: In this commentary we present our vision of how risk assessment to support exposure standards will be developed once a suitable suite of in vitro assays becomes available. Discussion: Issues to be faced basing risk assessments on in vitro data are more complex than, but conceptually similar to, those faced currently when applying in vivo data. Absent some <b>unforeseen</b> <b>technical</b> breakthrough, in vitro data {{will be used in}} ways similar to current practices that involve applying uncertainty or safety factors to no observed adverse effect levels or benchmark doses. TP models are unlikely to contribute quantitatively to risk assessments for several reasons, including that the statistical variability inherent in such complex models severely limits their usefulness in estimating small changes in response, and that such models will likely continue to involve empirical modeling of dose responses...|$|R

Program-level management is often told by engineers that the “sky is falling ” due to an <b>unforeseen</b> <b>technical</b> issue but is not moved to action without the occurrence of an unfortunate incident or a quantitative business case. Unfortunately, engineers often {{do not have the}} tools to articulate the risks and impacts that they foresee in terms that management understands such as cost and availability. In order to communicate the impact of the tin-lead to lead-free electronics conversion in terms of cost and availability, a simulation of fielded electronic systems to and through a repair facility was created. Systems manufactured with tin-lead parts (or a mixture of tin-lead and lead-free parts) that potentially have to be repaired with a mixture of tin-lead and lead-free parts are modeled. The model includes the effects of repair prioritization, multiple possible failure mechanisms, no-fault-founds, and un-repairable units. These effects are used to quantify and demonstrate the system- and enterprise-level risks posed by the tin-lead to lead-free conversion issue...|$|R
