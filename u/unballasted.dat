5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, <b>unballasted</b> wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|E

The preionizer placed upstream realizes the 100 kHz discharge through dielectric electrodes. On {{the basis of the}} principle of minimum of energy dissipation high efficiency of current distribution over crossings (20 × 5) with a small number of sections (20 + 5) is shown. It provides a stable DC discharge at average power input to 4 W/cm 3 due to influence of upstream discharges upon the downstream ones. The active medium of the laser was studied by method of IR luminescence at the wavelength 2 - 8 µm in "switched on " and "switched off " resonator. The luminescence intensity in the band 4. 3 µm gives the particular information about the active medium. The 2 D model of a discharge segmented along the gas flow was constructed to describe the distribution of electrical, gas-dynamic and kinetic characteristics. It was shown that in the most volume of chamber the discharge burns in the recombining plasma at reduced E/n, thus favoring high excitation efficiency...|$|R

60|$|There was thin, crisp {{snow on the}} ground, the sky was blue, {{the wind}} very cold, the air clear.

I noticed the ash-twigs up in the sky were pale and luminous, passing into the blue. And then I saw the peacocks.

They stepped archly over the filigree snow, and their bodies moved with slow motion, like small, light, flat-bottomed boats. I admired them, they were curious. Then a gust of wind caught them, heeled them over as if they were three frail boats opening their feathers like ragged sails. They hopped and skipped with discomfort, to get out of the draught of the wind. And then, in the lee of the walls, they resumed their arch, wintry motion, light and <b>unballasted</b> now their tails were gone, indifferent. They were indifferent to my presence. I might have touched them. They turned off to the shelter of an open shed.|$|E
60|$|The life of {{the strange}} and lonely town was characterised by a machine-like regularity, born perhaps of the iron road from which it derived its nourishment. Daily at {{three o'clock in the}} morning the 'camp-engine' started with the 'bank parties.' With the dawn the 'material' train arrived, the platelaying gangs swarmed over it like {{clusters}} of flies, and were carried to the extreme limit of the track. Every man knew his task, and knew, too, that he would return to camp when it was finished, and not before. Forthwith they set busily to work without the necessity of an order. A hundred yards of material was unloaded. The sleepers were arranged in a long succession. The rails were spiked to every alternate sleeper, and then the great 80-ton engine moved cautiously forward along the <b>unballasted</b> track, like an elephant trying a doubtful bridge. The operation was repeated continually through the hours of the burning day. Behind the train there followed other gangs of platelayers, who completed the spiking and ballasting process; and when the sun sank beneath the sands of the western horizon, and the engine pushed the empty trucks and the weary men home to the Railhead camp, it came back over a finished and permanent line. There was a brief interval while the camp-fires twinkled in the waste, like the lights of a liner in mid-ocean, while the officers and men chatted over their evening meal, and then the darkness and silence of the desert was unbroken till morning brought the glare and toil of another long day.|$|E
6000|$|Consider the Corn Production Bill. I will quote Mr. Prothero: [...] "National {{security}} {{is not an}} impracticable dream.

[...] "For all practical purposes, if we could grow at home here 82 per cent, of all the food that we require for five years, we should be safe, and that amount of independence of sea-borne supplies we can secure, and secure within a few years.... We could obtain that result if we could add 8,000,000 acres of arable land to our existing area--that is to say, if we increased it from 19,000,000 acres to 27,000,000 acres. If you once got that extension of your arable area, the nation would be safe from the nightmare of a submarine menace, and the number of additional men who would be required on the land would be something {{about a quarter of a}} million."

On a question so vast and vital you are bound to startle by any little measure. Nothing but an heroic measure would arouse debate on a scale adequate to reach and stir the depths of our national condition, and wake us all, politicians and public, to appreciate the fact that our whole future is in this matter, and that it must be tackled.|$|E

50|$|Having a short {{wheelbase}} and no leading bogie, the locomotives {{had a tendency}} to derail and they were ultimately restricted to a maximum speed of 40 km/h and relegated to shunting and branch line traffic. Driven slowly, they could negotiate the most appalling curves and badly maintained or <b>unballasted</b> tracks. They were therefore ideal in goods yards, such as Darling Harbour and Port Waratah with the last two withdrawn from the latter in August 1972. Branch lines such as those to Dorrigo, Batlow and Oberon where grades of up to 1 in 25 (4%) and curves as sharp as 100 m radius could be encountered were ideal for this class and these were the only locomotives permitted on these lines until dieselisation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flat-bottomed}} hull {{made these}} craft extremely versatile and economical. They could float {{in as little}} as 3 feet (1 m) of water and could dry out in the tidal waters without heeling over. This allowed them to visit the narrow tributaries and creeks of the Thames to load farm cargoes, or to dry out on the sand banks and mudflats to load materials for building and brickmaking (it was no coincidence that their use peaked while London was expanding rapidly). The main mast could be lowered to clear bridges. Furthermore, unlike most sailing craft, these barges could sail completely <b>unballasted</b> [...] - [...] a major saving in labour and time. The predominant rig was spritsail, though there were some that were sloop rigged with a gaff and an overhanging boom, and some that were ketch rigged.

50|$|Multihulls use {{flotation}} and/or weight positioned {{away from}} the centre line of the sailboat to counter {{the force of the}} wind. This is in contrast to heavy ballast that can account for up to 90% (in extreme cases like AC boats) of the weight of a monohull sailboat. In the case of a standard catamaran, there are two similarly-sized and -shaped slender hulls connected by beams, which are sometimes overlaid by a deck superstructure. Another catamaran variation is the proa. In the case of trimarans, which have an <b>unballasted</b> centre hull similar to a monohull, two smaller amas are situated parallel to the centre hull to resist the sideways force of the wind. The advantage of multihulled sailboats is that they do not suffer the performance penalty of having to carry heavy ballast, and their relatively lesser draft reduces the amount of drag, caused by friction and inertia when moving through the water.|$|E
50|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, <b>unballasted</b> wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|E
5000|$|Technically {{this line}} {{was not a}} very {{difficult}} one to construct, being <b>unballasted,</b> with the sharpest curve of 480 ft radius and a ruling gradient of 1 in 800, except the Jorhat-Cinnamara stretch where it was 1 in 400. At the initial stage Kokilamukh Railway found it cheaper to buy second-hand engines running on a similar gauge, the DHR being a storehouse of the worn out ones. [...] "Tiny" [...] was the first locomotive brought by the contractors to Siliguri to assist in the construction of DHR. The engine was originally named [...] "Sutaram", but by the time it reached Siliguri it had become [...] "Tiny". The exact date of [...] "Tiny's" [...] arrival at Siliguri is unknown, but it assisted the contractors in constructing the DHR from early 1880. This is certain because this was the engine pressed into service to haul the Viceroy and his party up the tramway. [...] "Tiny" [...] was never assigned a DHR number and was relegated to shunting duties around Siliguri. In 1886 it was packed off to serve the tea gardens of the Jorhat State Railways where it ran as their engine No. 4. It replaced the previous three locomotives which were prone to derailments with their wheels falling off. The [...] gauge wallahs of India were a closely knit fraternity, not averse to swapping rolling stocks with each other. For instance, Jimmy Shaw, the works Manager of DHR at Tindharia, visited the then redundant JPR in 1942, scrounging for a locomotive or two. He suggested that four of the latter's locomotives be purchased for the Kishanganj section, but management turned it down. The DHR sold four of its engines to the ARTC to be worked in the colliery tram track at Tipongpani, near Margherita. Similarly two of JPR’s locomotives were at work on the DHR {{until the end of the}} 20th century.|$|E

The soil was sandy clay loam with an average moisture content of 18 % b. d. from zero to 30 cm depth. Test treatments were combinations of three tractor types or conditions (U 650, MF 285 liquid ballasted and MF 285 with no liquid or weight ballast) and three levels of plowing depth (10 - 15 cm, 15 - 20 cm and 20 - 25 cm). Plowing speed was kept constant at about 4 km/h throughout the experiment. The measured or calculated parameters included: tractor drawbar pull and rolling resistance, drive wheel slip and tractor tractive efficiency. Statistical analysis of the test {{results showed that the}} primary difference between the tractor types or conditions was in their wheel slip, such that the average wheel slip of U 650 was lowest (12. 6 %) while that of <b>unballasted</b> MF 285 was highest (27 %) and was reduced to 17. 7 % with liquid ballasting. Also, while growth of <b>unballasted</b> MF 285 wheel slip with increasing plowing depth was drastically high (11 % to 48 %), that of U 650 was quite moderate (9. 7 % to 16. 5 %). Analysis of the calculated values of TE showed that there was no significant changes in the TE of U 650 with increasing plowing depth and that with an average of 73. 8 %, it had a desirable performance. The TE of <b>unballasted</b> MF 285 that was over 75 % at shallow plowing, dropped to 46 % with increasing plowing depth, while water ballasting improved the decreasing trend of TE with plowing depth and raised its minimum value to about 63 %.

40|$|The {{results from}} a study aimed at {{improving}} the dynamic and aerodynamic characteristics of composite rotor blades {{through the use of}} extension-twist coupling are presented. A set of low twist model-scale helicopter rotor blades was manufactured with a view towards demonstrating the passive blade twist control concept.

The blades were spun through the 0 - 800 rpm range, with a corresponding sweep of collective pitch to determine the effect on the blade elastic twist. Hover data were obtained for both a ballasted and <b>unballasted</b> blade configuration in atmospheric conditions, where maximum twist changes of 2. 54 and 5. 24 degrees were respectively observed. These results compared well with those from a finite element analysis of the blade, which yielded maximum twists of 3. 01 and 5. 61 degrees for the <b>unballasted</b> and ballasted blade configurations, respectively.

This study {{assessed}} the effectiveness of treating <b>unballasted</b> transoceanic vessels using three different biocides: glutaraldehyde plus a surfactant adjuvant (Disinfekt 1000 ®), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), and SeaKleen ™ (menadione and menadione metabisulfite 2 : 8). Efficacy against several classes of aquatic organisms was evaluated using 24 h acute toxicity experiments and 11 day ballast tank simulation experiments. The results indicate substantial, compound-specific variations in organism sensitivity. For water-only exposures, NaOCl and SeaKleen™ were most effective: NaOCl had the lowest LC 90 (90 % lethal concentration value) for the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus (1. 0 mg L– 1), while SeaKleen ™ had the lowest LC 90 for the amphipod Hyalella azteca (2. 5 mg L– 1). Sediments profoundly affected efficacy, particularly for NaOCl: At a 1 : 4 sediment-water ratio, the estimated LC 90 for L. variegatus was> 2, 000 mg L– 1. Sediment quality also impacted efficacy: Sediments with higher organic carbon content typically required greater biocide concentrations to achieve comparable toxicity. Efficacy was further evaluated with 11 day bioassays using sediments from <b>unballasted</b> vessels. Results indicated that NaOCl and Disinfekt 1000 ® were more effective than predicted based on small scale sediment-water exposures. Overall, the data suggest that although NaOC...|$|E
