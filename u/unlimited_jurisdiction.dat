25|$|In the Kingdom of Cochin, Desavazhis and Naduvazhis were {{empowered}} {{to settle the}} disputes following the prevailing customary law. More serious matters used to be attended by the monarch himself. In 1812, {{for the first time}} in its history, graded law courts were established under the Diwanship of Colonel Munro, in the Kingdom of Cochin. The first Subordinate Courts (Sub Courts) were established by Colonel Munro at Trichur (Thrissur) and Tripunithura. Until 1835, Huzur Court was the final appellate Court. Huzur Court had a bench strength of three judges. Later the Huzur Court was reconstituted as Rajah's Court of Appeal and Subordinate Courts were reconstituted as Zilla Courts.

500|$|While {{some critics}} feared that {{granting}} the courts <b>unlimited</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> would create [...] "a most undignified {{game of chess}} between the Chancery Division and the legislature", and that it allowed tax planners another way to hide funds, the Act received general approval at the time. It was later criticised as expensive and slow in regards to allowing trustees the right to alter their investment powers, and {{this part of the}} Act was later superseded by the Trustee Investments Act 1961. [...] The second class of beneficiaries covered in Section 1(1) caused problems for the courts; since it only allows the court to alter a trust document where a person [...] "may be entitled", nothing can be done once this entitlement is confirmed.|$|E

60|$|The {{priests of}} the Sun do not marry, but are {{recruited}} as young men specially {{devoted to the}} work by their parents {{and supported by the}} State. The nomination to the higher offices of the priesthood lies with the Crown, but once appointed the nominees cannot be dispossessed, and it is scarcely too much to say that they really rule the land. To begin with, they are a united body sworn to obedience and secrecy, so that an order issued by the High Priest at Milosis will be instantly and unhesitatingly acted upon by the resident priest of a little country town three or four hundred miles off. They are the judges of the land, criminal and civil, an appeal lying only to the lord paramount of the district, and from him to the king; and they have, of course, practically <b>unlimited</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over religious and moral offences, together with a right of excommunication, which, as in the faiths of more highly civilized lands, is a very effective weapon. Indeed, their rights and powers are almost unlimited, but I may as well state here that the priests of the Sun are wise in their generation, and do not push things too far. It is but very seldom that they go to extremes against anybody, being more inclined to exercise the prerogative of mercy than run the risk of exasperating the powerful and vigorous-minded people on whose neck they have set their yoke, lest it should rise and break it off altogether.|$|E
