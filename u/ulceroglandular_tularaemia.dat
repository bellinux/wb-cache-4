40|$|The study {{describes}} {{four cases}} of tularaemia – one developed after contact with rabbits and three developed after an arthropod bite. Due to non-specific clinical symptoms, accurate diagnosis of tularaemia may be difficult. The increasing {{contribution of the}} arthropod vectors in the transmission of the disease indicates that special effort {{should be made to}} apply sensitive and specific diagnostic methods for tularaemia, and to remind health-care workers about this route of [i]Francisella tularensis[/i] infections. The advantages and disadvantages of various diagnostic methods – molecular, serological and microbiological culture – are discussed. The PCR as a rapid and proper diagnostic method for <b>ulceroglandular</b> <b>tularaemia</b> is presented...|$|E
40|$|In various human {{intracellular}} bacterial diseases, {{an increase}} of the proportion of circulating Vγ 9 Vδ 2 T cells has been observed. The prevalence of the finding among infected subjects and {{the time course of}} the elevation remain to be investigated. In the present study, comprising blood samples from a large number of cases of <b>ulceroglandular</b> <b>tularaemia,</b> the percentage of Vγ 9 Vδ 2 T cells within the first week of onset of disease (5 · 3 ± 0 · 7 % (mean±s. e. m.)) did not differ from that of control subjects (5 · 3 ± 0 · 8 %). Thereafter, percentages increased rapidly and within the interval of 8 – 40 days mean levels were > 20 % (P 10 %. Significantly increased levels were still recorded at 18 months (13 · 8 ± 2 · 4 %; P 0 · 10). Thus, a consistent increase of circulating Vγ 9 Vδ 2 T cells was demonstrated in tularaemia. The initial delay and the prolonged course of elevation may suggest a role in immunoregulation and/or immunological memory. Furthermore, the percentage of γδ T cells expressing tumour necrosis factor-alpha in response to phorbol myristate acetate was decreased during the first week and up to 40 days after onset, possibly reflecting the modulation of an inflammatory response...|$|E
