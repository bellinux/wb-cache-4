50|$|By {{the light}} of torches, the British {{soldiers}} set to work. They removed the grille, then the stones that formed a border to the tomb. The topsoil had already been removed and the French shared among themselves the flowers that had been growing in it. The soldiers then pulled up the three slabs that were closing the pit over. Long efforts were needed {{to break through the}} masonry enclosing the coffin. At 9.30 the last slab was raised and the coffin could be seen. Coquereau took some water from the nearby spring, blessed it and sprinkled it over the coffin, before reciting the psalm De profundis. The coffin was raised and transported into a large blue and white striped tent that had been put up the previous day. Then they proceeded to open the bier, in complete silence. The first coffin, of mahogany, had to be sawn off at both ends to get out the second coffin, made of lead, which was then placed within the neo-classical, ebony coffin that had been brought for it from France. General Middlemore and Lieutenant Touchard then arrived and presented themselves, before the party proceeded to <b>unsolder</b> the lead coffin. The coffin inside this, again of mahogany, was remarkably well-preserved. Its screws were removed with difficulty. It was then possible to open, with infinite care, the final coffin, made of tin.|$|E

40|$|A device denoted a board saver {{has been}} {{developed}} {{as a means of}} reducing wear and tear of a printed-circuit board onto which an antifuse field programmable gate array (FPGA) is to be eventually soldered permanently after a number of design iterations. The need for the board saver or a similar device arises because (1) antifuse-FPGA design iterations are common and (2) repeated soldering and <b>unsoldering</b> of FPGAs on the printed-circuit board to accommodate design iterations can wear out the printed-circuit board. The board saver is basically a solderable/unsolderable FPGA receptacle that is installed temporarily on the printed-circuit board. The board saver is, more specifically, a smaller, square-ring-shaped, printed-circuit board (see figure) that contains half via holes one for each contact pad along its periphery. As initially fabricated, the board saver is a wider ring containing full via holes, but then it is milled along its outer edges, cutting the via holes in half and laterally exposing their interiors. The board saver is positioned in registration with the designated FPGA footprint and each via hole is soldered to the outer portion of the corresponding FPGA contact pad on the first-mentioned printed-circuit board. The via-hole/contact joints can be inspected visually and can be easily <b>unsoldered</b> later. The square hole {{in the middle of the}} board saver is sized to accommodate the FPGA, and the thickness of the board saver is the same as that of the FPGA. Hence, when a non-final FPGA is placed in the square hole, the combination of the non-final FPGA and the board saver occupy no more area and thickness than would a final FPGA soldered directly into its designated position on the first-mentioned circuit board. The contact leads of a non-final FPGA are not bent and are soldered, at the top of the board saver, to the corresponding via holes. A non-final FPGA can readily be <b>unsoldered</b> from the board saver and replaced by another one. Once the final FPGA design has been determined, the board saver can be <b>unsoldered</b> from the contact pads on the first-mentioned printed-circuit board and replaced by the final FPGA...|$|R

Specialised companies carry out data recovery, at significant cost, by opening the drives in a clean room and using appropriate equipment to read data from the platters directly. If the electronics have failed, it is sometimes possible to replace the electronics board, though often drives of nominally exactly the same model manufactured at different times have different circuit boards that are incompatible. Moreover, electronics boards of modern drives usually contain drive-specific adaptation data required for accessing their system areas, so the related componentry needs to be either reprogrammed (if possible) or <b>unsoldered</b> and transferred between two electronics boards.|$|R

On the other hand, based on the manufacturer's claim, this alloy is similar to Verabond 2.

Twelve standard dambble shape samples, with the length of 18 mm and the diameter of 3 mm, were prepared from each alloy. Six samples of each alloy were divided into two pieces with carboradom disk. Soldering gap distance was 0. 3 mm, measured by a special jig and they were soldered by Verasolder alloy. Six other samples, of both Iranian and foreign <b>unsoldered</b> alloys were considered as control group. Then samples were examined under tensile force and their tensile strength was recorded. Two- way variance analysis showed that the tensile strength of Minalux alloy and Verabond 2 were not statistically significant (Verasoler 686, Minalux 723), but after soldering, such difference became significant (Minalux 308, Verabond 2 432).

40|$|Data {{presented}} are {{the culmination}} of experiments studying the combined effects of polarity, contact and current risetime on wire array z-pinches operated on the 1 MA, 100 - 200 ns Cornell University COBRA pulsed power generator. Data were collected on 16 -wire, 12. 5 mu-m phi aluminum z-pinch arrays in both negative and positive polarity, with soldered and non-soldered contacts, and with slow and fast risetimes (100 ns and 200 ns). A minimum of five shots were collected {{for each of the}} eight cases to obtain statistical significance. The initiation, ablation, implosion and stagnation phases were compared for the various cases. Polarity was modified via a 12 nH bolt-on convolute, rotatable to provide positive or negative polarity with similar inductance in each case, allowing sideby-side comparisons. Contact was modified by applying Pb 60 Sn 40 solder to the cathode wire-electrode contact point or leaving the array <b>unsoldered.</b> The current risetime was varied between a 100 ns "short" pulse and 200 ns "long" pulse by utilizing current-pulse shaping capabilities of the COBRA pulsed power generator. These experiments aimed to build upon previous research by Duselis et al. (2004), which showed that polarity, contact and current risetime have significant impact on energy deposited and uniformity of expansion of single wires under low-current (less than 10 kA) conditions. These low current experiments were designed to mimic the conditions on a single wire of a wire-array z-pinch during initiation, also known as the resistive voltage phase. Experiments presented here aim to build upon this research by establishing {{a better understanding of the}} effects of polarity, contact and current risetime on the initiation, ablation, implosion and stagnation phases of wire array z-pinches, and also to understand the utility of low current, single wire results as they pertain to higher current, wire array z-pinches. The data were collected in two separate experimental runs: a preliminary dataset with only contact and current risetime as the variables (four distinct cases), and a second, full dataset examining polarity, contact and current risetime (eight distinct cases). The first dataset showed a significant improvement to long pulse shots when the wires were soldered to the cathode, but no improvements to short pulse shots. Long pulse, soldered shots from this dataset were also observed to exhibit the "Christmas tree" effect, or time-accelerated pinch dynamics at the cathode and axial flow towards the anode. The second dataset showed that, with short pulses only, operating arrays in positive polarity resulted in a 25 % improvement in deposited energy, 30 % smaller achieved current radius, 20 % improvement in peak x-ray power and a 50 % improvement in x-ray yield when compared to negative polarity arrays. Soldering contacts showed a 10 % improvement in initiation energy deposited in positive polarity only, but no subsequent correlated improvement in x-ray yield. Short pulse shots showed a ten-fold increase in peak x-ray powers and yield over long pulse shots. The two datasets were compared, and recommendations for future work were developed...|$|R

He, stepping down [...] By zig-zag paths, and juts of pointed rock, [...] Came on the shining levels of the lake. [...] There drew he forth the brand Excalibur, [...] And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon, [...] Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth [...] And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt: [...] For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks, [3] [...] Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work [...] Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long [...] That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood, [...] This way and that dividing the swift mind, [4] [...] In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd [...] Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd [...] There in the many-knotted waterflags, [...] That whistled stiff and dry about the marge. [...] So strode he back slow to the wounded king. [...] Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: [...] "Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave? [...] What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?" [...] And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: [...] "I heard the ripple washing in the reeds, [5] [...] And the wild water lapping on the crag." [...] To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale: [...] "Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name, [...] Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd [...] Thy fëalty, nor like a noble knight: [...] For surer sign had follow'd, either hand, [...] Or voice, or else a motion of the mere. [...] This is a shameful thing for men to lie. [...] Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again [6] [...] As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing [...] I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word." [...] Then went Sir Bedivere the second time [...] Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere, [7] [...] Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in thought; [...] But when he saw the wonder of the hilt, [...] How curiously and strangely chased, he smote [...] His palms together, and he cried aloud, [...] "And if indeed I cast the brand away, [...] Surely a precious thing, one worthy note, [...] Should thus be lost for ever from the earth, [...] Which might have pleased the eyes of many men. [...] What good should follow this, if this were done? [...] What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey, [...] Seeing obedience is the bond of rule, [...] Were it well to obey then, if a king demand [...] An act unprofitable against himself? [...] The king is sick, and knows not what he does. [...] What record, or what relic of my lord [...] Should be to aftertime, but empty breath [...] And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept, [...] Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings, [...] Some one might show it at a joust of arms, [...] Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur, [...] Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake. [...] Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps [...] Upon the hidden bases of the hills." [...] So might some old man speak in the aftertime [...] To all the people, winning reverence. [...] But now much honour and much fame were lost." [...] So spake he, clouded with his own conceit, [...] And hid Excalibur the second time, [...] And so strode back slow to the wounded King. [...] Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily: [...] "What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?" [...] And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: [...] "I heard the water lapping on the crag, [...] And the long ripple washing in the reeds." [...] To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath: [...] "Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue, [8] [...] Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me! [...] Authority forgets a dying king, [9] [...] Laid widow'd of the power in his eye [...] That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art, [...] For thou, the latest-left of all my knights, [...] In whom should meet the offices of all, [...] Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt; [...] Either from lust of gold, or like a girl [...] Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes. [...] Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice, [...] And the third time may prosper, get thee hence: [...] But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur, [...] I will arise and slay thee with my hands." [...] Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran, [10] [...] And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged [...] Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword, [...] And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand [...] Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon, [...] And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch, [...] Shot like a streamer of the northern morn, [...] Seen where the moving isles of winter shock [...] By night, with noises of the northern sea. [...] So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur: [...] But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm [...] Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, [...] And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him [...] Three times, and drew him under in the mere. [...] And lightly went the other to the King. [...] Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath: [...] "Now see I by thine eyes that this is done. [...] Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?" [...] And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: [...] "Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems [...] Should blind my purpose, for I never saw, [...] Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die, [...] Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men, [...] So great a miracle as yonder hilt. [...] Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him; [...] But when I look'd again, behold an arm, [...] Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, [...] That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him [...] Three times, and drew him under in the mere." [...] And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard: [...] "My end draws nigh;'tis time that I were gone. [...] Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight, [...] And bear me to the margin; yet I fear [11] [...] My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die." [...] So saying, from the pavement he hath rose, [...] Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm, [...] And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes [...] As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere [...] Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears, [...] And would have spoken, but he found not words, [...] Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee, [...] O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands, [...] And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs. [...] But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard, [...] Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed [...] When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King, [...] Muttering and murmuring at his ear" [...] Quick, quick! I fear it is too late, and I shall die [...] ". [...] But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge, [...] Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd, [...] Larger than human on the frozen hills. [...] He heard the deep behind him, and a cry [...] Before. His own thought drove him like a goad. [...] Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves [...] And barren chasms, and all to left and right [...] The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based [...] His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang [...] Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels-- [...] And on a sudden, lo! the level lake, [...] And the long glories of the winter moon. [...] Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge, [12] [...] Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern, [...] Beneath them; and descending they were ware [...] That all the decks were dense with stately forms [...] Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream--by these [...] Three Queens with crowns of gold--and from them rose [...] A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars, [...] And, as it were one voice, an agony [...] Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills [...] All night in a waste land, where no one comes, [...] Or hath come, since the making of the world. [...] Then murmur'd Arthur, [...] "Place me in the barge," [...] And to the barge they came. There those three Queens [...] Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept. [...] But she, that rose the tallest of them all [...] And fairest, laid his head upon her lap, [...] And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands, [...] And call'd him by his name, complaining loud, [...] And dropping bitter tears against his brow [...] Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white [...] And colourless, and like the wither'd moon [...] Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east; [...] And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops [...] Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls-- [...] That made his forehead like a rising sun [...] High from the däis-throne--were parch'd with dust; [...] Or, clotted into points and hanging loose, [...] Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips. [...] So like a shatter'd column lay the King; [...] Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest, [...] From spur to plume a star of tournament, [...] Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged [...] Before the eyes of ladies and of kings. [...] Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere, [13] [...] "Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go? [...] Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes? [...] For now I see the true old times are dead, [...] When every morning brought a noble chance, [...] And every chance brought out a noble knight. [...] Such times have been not since the light that led [...] The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh. [...] But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved [...] Which was an image of the mighty world; [...] And I, the last, go forth companionless. [...] And the days darken round me, and the years, [...] Among new men, strange faces, other minds." [...] And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge: [...] "The old order changeth, yielding place to new, [...] And God fulfils Himself in many ways, [14] [...] Lest one good custom should corrupt the world. [...] Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me? [...] I have lived my life, and that which I have done [...] May He within Himself make pure! but thou, [...] If thou shouldst never see my face again, [...] Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer [...] Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice [...] Rise like a fountain for me night and day. [...] For what are men better than sheep or goats [...] That nourish a blind life within the brain, [...] If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer [...] Both for themselves and those who call them friend? [...] For so the whole round earth is every way [...] Bound by gold chains [15] about the feet of God. [...] But now farewell. I am going a long way [...] With these thou seëst--if indeed I go-- [...] (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt) [...] To the island-valley of Avilion; [...] Where falls not hail, or rain, [16] or any snow, [...] Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies [...] Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard-lawns [...] And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea, [17] [...] Where I will heal me of my grievous wound." [...] So said he, and the barge with oar and sail [...] Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan [...] That, fluting a wild carol ere her death, [...] Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood [...] With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere [...] Revolving many memories, till the hull [...] Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn. [...] And on the mere the wailing died away.|$|R
