5|$|Carlton House Terrace {{underwent}} {{a series of}} renovations between 1999 and November 2003 to improve and standardise the property.

An effort was also made to make {{the layout of the}} buildings easier, consolidating all the offices on one floor, Fellows' Rooms on another and all the accommodation on a third.|$|E

5|$|DAB+ is a {{major upgrade}} to DAB, widely <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> {{countries}} in Europe. It was first tested in the United Kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016. DAB+ is not backwards compatible with DAB so older radios cannot receive DAB+ stations. There are no plans {{in the foreseeable future}} {{for the vast majority of}} BBC and commercial stations to transition from DAB to DAB+. Estimates given by multiplex operator Switch Digital suggests that a third of radio sets in 2016 were DAB+ compatible.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} few decades, these paper targets have been {{gradually}} replaced by electronic target systems, immediately displaying the results on monitors. When using these systems, actual scoring lines are not printed, but {{the location of the}} impact hole (which can be determined acoustically) is automatically converted into corresponding scores by a computer. ISSF rules now require the use of these systems in top-level competitions. They are generally <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> international competitions as well, and in some countries they are even common in national competitions.|$|E
5|$|For {{artifacts}} {{such as the}} Sky Disc of Nebra, {{alleged to}} be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos, the analysis {{would be similar to}} typical post-excavation analysis as <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> sub-disciplines in archaeology. An artefact is examined and attempts are made to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.|$|E

Before the film's {{production}} started, fans campaigned on the Internet to retain Baker as R2-D2; Lucas replied that the actor would remain.

5|$|Metal {{artefacts}} {{share the}} same geometric designs that are <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> forms of Islamic art. However, {{in the view of}} Hamilton Gibb, the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area they are most often used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. Geometric designs in Islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs, or they can form the background pattern.|$|E

The Eastern Lady Chapel has two bays, the sacristy one-bay and the Berkeley Chapel two bays.

5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} {{has also}} been <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> styles of architecture. For instance, Leonardo da Vinci sketched this shape as the plan for a fortification. A modern high-rise building, the Kölntriangle in Cologne, Germany, was built with a Reuleaux triangle cross-section.

5|$|The Royal Stoa was {{destroyed}} by the Roman army during the sack of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Its site on the Temple Mount esplanade is currently inaccessible to archaeologists. However, artifacts from the Stoa have been recovered both from excavations {{at the foot of}} the platform and in secondary use in later constructions. This evidence has confirmed details given in the accounts of the historian Josephus, and has also allowed comparison of the Royal Stoa's decoration with that <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>other,</b> contemporaneous monumental buildings.|$|E

5|$|Two other fragmentary {{copies of}} the same decree were {{discovered}} later, and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, including two slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees (the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC, and the Memphis decree of PtolemyIV, c. 218 BC). The Rosetta Stone is, therefore, no longer unique, {{but it was the}} essential key to modern understanding of Ancient Egyptian literature and civilisation.

5|$|As {{an iconic}} skill, bicycle kicks are an {{important}} part of association football culture. Executing a bicycle kick in a competitive football match, particularly in scoring a goal, usually garners wide attention in the sports media. The bicycle kick has been featured in works of art, such as sculptures, films, advertisements, and literature. The manoeuvre is also <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> similar ball sports, particularly in the variants of association football like futsal and beach soccer. The controversy over the move's invention and name in Brazil, Chile, and Peru (and its status as an element of the notable Chile–Peru football rivalry) has added to the kick's acclaim in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|As with X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter was {{initially}} {{developed for the}} CP System II arcade system board. The game debuted in Japanese and North American arcades in 1997. The game received a port to the Sega Saturn, exclusive to Japan, on October 22, 1998. The Sega Saturn port supported the 4MB RAM expansion peripheral, allowing the developers to create a conversion which retained the original frame rates and tag team system. The game was then ported to the PlayStation in February 1999. Due to the console's limited RAM capacity, the tag team format was switched to the more traditional round format <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>other</b> fighting game series, such as Street Fighter. To compensate {{for the removal of}} tag team gameplay, several new game modes, such as Hero Battle and Cross Over, were implemented.|$|E
