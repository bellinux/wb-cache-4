40|$|AbstractUncoating is an {{essential}} step in viral replication cycle. Little {{is known about the}} mechanism and requirement of HIV <b>uncoating.</b> Using an in vitro <b>uncoating</b> model, we demonstrate here that the <b>uncoating</b> of HIV- 1 was efficiently induced by lysate from activated CD 4 + lymphocytes, while quiescent CD 4 + lymphocyte lysate was unable to <b>uncoat</b> HIV- 1 core. The <b>uncoating</b> activity was associated with an induction of in vitro reverse transcription of the viral genome. Using CD 4 + lymphocytes that were arrested in cell cycle, we showed that the <b>uncoating</b> activity required transition of cells from G 0 /G 1 a into G 1 b stage. These results strongly suggested a requirement of cell cycle-dependent specific factors for HIV- 1 <b>uncoating.</b> The putative HIV- 1 <b>uncoating</b> factors could be fractionated from cell lysate by gel filtration chromatography...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEfficient <b>uncoating</b> {{requires}} {{not only}} an optimal cellular environment, but also some intrinsic properties of the viral capsid protein itself. Using an in vitro <b>uncoating</b> model, we demonstrated that substitution of each serine residue with alanine at the three major phosphorylation sites of HIV- 1 capsid protein, i. e. Ser- 109, Ser- 149 and Ser- 178, could significantly reduce <b>uncoating</b> activity of purified core particles. We also showed that the core stability of mutant viruses was {{lower than that of}} the wild-type virus so that the lack of efficient <b>uncoating</b> of each mutant could not be due to an increase in capsid physical stability. However, serine-to-aspartic acid mutation to mimic the negative charge of phosphor-serine could not restore either <b>uncoating</b> activity or infectivity, and treatment of purified core particles with a phosphatase did not alter the <b>uncoating</b> activity.

40|$|During {{the early}} stages of HIV- 1 {{replication}} the conical capsid composed of p 24 CA protein dissociates {{from the rest of the}} cytoplasmic viral complex by a process called <b>uncoating.</b> Although proper <b>uncoating</b> is known to be required for HIV- 1 infection, many questions remain about the timing and factors involved in the process. Here we have used two complementary assays to study the process of <b>uncoating</b> in HIV- 1 –infected cells, specifically looking at the timing of <b>uncoating</b> and its relationship to reverse transcription. We developed a fluorescent microscopy-based <b>uncoating</b> assay that detects the association of p 24 CA with HIV- 1 viral complexes in cells. We also used an owl monkey kidney (OMK) cell assay that is based on timed TRIM-CypA–mediated restriction of HIV- 1 replication. Results from both assays indicate that <b>uncoating</b> is initiated within 1 h of viral fusion. In addition, treatment with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine delayed <b>uncoating</b> in both assays. Analysis of reverse transcription products in OMK cells revealed that the generation of early reverse transcription products coincides with the timing of <b>uncoating</b> in these assays. Collectively, these results suggest that some aspect of reverse transcription has the ability to influence the kinetics of <b>uncoating...</b>|$|R
40|$|Viruses are quasi-inert {{macromolecular}} assemblies.

40|$|Viral receptors serve both {{to target}} viruses to {{specific}} cell types and to actively promote {{the entry of}} bound virus into cells. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) can form complexes in vitro with a truncated soluble form of the HRV cell surface receptor, ICAM- 1. These complexes appear to be stoichiometric, with approximately 60 ICAM molecules bound per virion or 1 ICAM- 1 molecule per icosahedral face of the capsid. The complex can have two fates, either dissociating to yield free virus and free ICAM- 1 or <b>uncoating</b> to break down to an 80 S empty capsid which has released VP 4, viral RNA, and ICAM- 1. This <b>uncoating</b> in vitro mimics the <b>uncoating</b> of virus during infection of cells. The stability of the virus-receptor complex is dependent on temperature and the rhinovirus serotype. HRV serotype 14 (HRV 14) -ICAM- 1 complexes rapidly <b>uncoat,</b> HRV 16 forms a stable virus-ICAM complex which does not <b>uncoat</b> detectably at 34 degrees C, and HRV 3 has an intermediate phenotype. Rhinovirus can also <b>uncoat</b> after exposure to mildly acidic pH. The sensitivities of individual rhinovirus serotypes to ICAM- 1 -mediated virus <b>uncoating</b> do not correlate with <b>uncoating</b> promoted by incubation at low pH, suggesting that these two means of virus destabilization occur by different mechanisms.

25|$|Copper {{toxicity}} {{can occur}} from excessive supplement use, eating acid foods cooked in <b>uncoated</b> copper cookware, exposure to excess copper in drinking water, {{or as the}} result of an inherited metabolic disorder in the case of Wilson's disease. A significant portion of the toxicity of copper comes from its ability to accept and donate single electrons as it changes oxidation state. This catalyzes the production of very reactive radical ions, such as hydroxyl radical {{in a manner similar to}} Fenton chemistry. This catalytic activity of copper is used by the enzymes with which it is associated, thus is only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. This increase in unmediated reactive radicals is generally termed oxidative stress, and is an active area of research in a variety of diseases where copper may play an important but more subtle role than in acute toxicity.|$|E
40|$|<b>Uncoating</b> of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV- 1) {{and type}} 2 (HIV- 2) conical cores is an {{important}} early step for establishment of infection. In Old World Monkey (OWM) cells, the TRIM 5 α cellular factor potently suppresses an early step of infection by HIV- 1. Previously, biochemical studies using whole cell lysates of infected cells revealed that OWM TRIM 5 α accelerates the <b>uncoating</b> of HIV- 1, leading to premature reverse transcription. In the present study, we re-evaluated <b>uncoating</b> kinetics of HIV- 1 {{in the presence of}} OWM TRIM 5 α by using an in situ <b>uncoating</b> assay, which allowed us to differentiate productive HIV- 1 entry from simple (non-productive) endocytosis. Results showed that the <b>uncoating</b> kinetics of HIV- 1 was indeed accelerated in the presence of OWM TRIM 5 α. Furthermore, we adapted an in situ <b>uncoating</b> assay to HIV- 2, which showed wide variations in TRIM 5 α sensitivity among different isolates. HIV- 2 isolate GH 123, whose infectivity was suppressed by cynomolgus monkey (CM) TRIM 5 α, showed accelerated <b>uncoating</b> in the presence of CM TRIM 5 α. In contrast, mutant HIV- 2 ASA, whose infectivity was unaltered by CM TRIM 5 α, showed no change in <b>uncoating</b> kinetics in the presence of CM TRIM 5 α.

40|$|Abstract HIV <b>uncoating</b> {{is defined}} as the loss of viral capsid that occurs within the {{cytoplasm}} of infected cells before entry of the viral genome into the nucleus. It is an obligatory step of HIV- 1 early infection and accompanies the transition between reverse transcription complexes (RTCs), in which reverse transcription occurs, and pre-integration complexes (PICs), which are competent to integrate into the host genome. The study of the nature and timing of HIV- 1 <b>uncoating</b> has been paved with difficulties, particularly {{as a result of the}} vulnerability of the capsid assembly to experimental manipulation. Nevertheless, recent studies of capsid structure, retroviral restriction and mechanisms of nuclear import, as well as the recent expansion of technical advances in genome-wide studies and cell imagery approaches, have substantially changed our understanding of HIV <b>uncoating.</b> Although early work suggested that <b>uncoating</b> occurs immediately following viral entry in the cell, thus attributing a trivial role for the capsid in infected cells, recent data suggest that <b>uncoating</b> occurs several hours later and that capsid has an all-important role in the cell that it infects: for transport towards the nucleus, reverse transcription and nuclear import. Knowing that <b>uncoating</b> occurs at a later stage suggests that the viral capsid interacts extensively with the cytoskeleton and other cytoplasmic components during its transport to the nucleus, which leads to a considerable reassessment of our efforts to identify potential therapeutic targets for HIV therapy. This review discusses our current understanding of HIV <b>uncoating,</b> the functional interplay between infectivity and timely <b>uncoating,</b> as well as exposing the appropriate methods to study <b>uncoating</b> and addressing the many questions that remain unanswered. </p...|$|R

VSV was adsorbed to BHK cells and allowed to become internalized {{in the presence of}} 100 mM NH 4 Cl; the NH 4 Cl was then removed to initiate synchronized <b>uncoating.</b> The three major structural proteins of VSV, the matrix protein (M), the nucleocapsid protein (N), and the glycoprotein (G), were each distributed uniquely after <b>uncoating.</b> Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that both G and N proteins retained a punctate distribution, whereas M protein was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm, suggesting that it had become soluble. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that N protein was found in clusters (presumably in intact nucleocapsids) associated with the cell cytoskeleton and in unfused virions in endosomes and lysosomes. M protein was found diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm and also in endosomes and lysosomes.

In the electron microscope the involvement of coated vesicles was shown for the initial uptake of virions, possibly followed by the engagement of acidic vesicles as judged from the effects of lysosomotropic agents on gene expression.
