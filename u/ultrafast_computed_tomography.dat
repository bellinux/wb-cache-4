BackgroundCardiovascular calcification (CVC) is common and severe in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. However, the prevalence and severity of CVC is less well documented in patients with {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) not yet on dialysis. MethodsFifty-eight nondialyzed HA with type 2 diabetes and CKD were enrolled. They comprise 29 patients with stages 1 and 2 CKD (early CKD group) and 26 patients with stages 4 and 5 CKD (advanced CKD group). Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was measured by <b>ultrafast</b> spiral <b>computed</b> <b>tomography,</b> while peripheral artery calcification (PAC) was evaluated by plain x-ray of the chest, pelvis, thighs, and lower extremities. ResultsThe prevalence of CAC and PAC were significantly higher in the advanced CKD group compared to the early CKD group (73 % vs. 38 %; P < 0. 01 and 85 % vs. 35 %; P < 0. 0001, respectively). The median CAC scores were 18 -fold greater in the advanced CKD group (138. 9 vs. 7. 8, respectively).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the relation between coronary artery calcification detected by <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> tomographic scanning and histopathologic coronary artery disease. Background. Recent studies suggest that discrete coronary artery calcification as visualized by <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> tomographic scanning may facilitate the noninvasive detection of estimation, or both, of the in situ extent of coronary disease. Such quantitative relations have not been established. Methods. Thirteen consecutive perfusion-fixed outopsy hearts (from eight male and five female patients aged 17 to 83 years) were scanned by <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> tomographic scanning in contiguous 3 -mm tomographic sections. The major epicardial arteries were dissected free, positioned longitudinally and scanned again in cross section. Coronary artery calcification in a coronary segment was defined as the presence of one or more voxels with a computed tomographic density 130 Hounsfleld units. Each epicardial artery was sectioned longitudinally, stained and measured with a planimeter for quantification of cross-sectional and atherosclerotic plaque areas at 3 -mm intervals, corresponding to the computed tomographic scans. A total of 522 paired coronary computed tomographic and histologic sections were studied. Results. Direct relations were found between <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> tomographic scanning coronary artery calcium burden and atherosclerotic plaque area and percent lumen area stenosis. However, the range for plaque area or percent lumen stenosis, or both, associated with a given calcium burden was broad. Three hundred thirty-one coronary segments showed no calcification by <b>computed</b> <b>tomography.</b> Although atherosclerotic disease was found in several corresponding pathologic specimens, 97 % of these noncalcified segments were associated with nonobstructive disease (< 75 % area stenosis); if no calcification was determined in an entire coronary vessel, all corresponding coronary disease was found to be nonobstructive. To determine the relation between arterial calcification and any atheromatous disease, computed tomographic calcium burden for each segment was paired with the histologic absence or presence of disease. <b>Ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> tomographic scanning had a sensitivity and specificity of 59 % and 90 % and a negative and positive predictive value of 65 % and 87 %, respectively. A direct correlation was found (r = 0. 99) between total calcium burden calculated from tomographic scans of the heart as a whole and scans of the arteries obtained in cross section. Conclusions. The detection of coronary calcification by <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> tomographic scanning is highly predictive of the presence of histopathologic coronary disease, but the use of this technique to define the extent of coronary disease may be limited. However, the absence of coronary calcification at any site is highly specific for the absence of obstructive disease...|$|R

This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the relation between coronary calcification detected with <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> and lumen narrowing defined with angiography and evaluated whether this relation is influenced by age and gender. Background. <b>Ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> {{has been shown to}} be a sensitive method for detection of coronary calcification associated with atherosclerotic disease, but the relation between the extent of coronary calcification and degree of lumen narrowing and the possible influence of gender or age, or both, on this relation have not been clarified. Methods. Seventy men and 70 women were studied with <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> for analysis of coronary calcification and coronary angiography. Coronary atherosclerosis was considered present if any lumen irregularity was noted on angiography, and obstructive coronary artery disease was defined as a lumen diameter narrowing ≥ 70 %. Results. Coronary calcification had a sensitivity of 88 % for identification of patients with atherosclerotic disease and 97 % for those with obstructive disease, with corresponding specificities of 55 % and 41 %, respectively. The sensitivity of coronary calcium for detection of atherosclerotic disease in women 60 years old and the 87 % sensitivity in men < 60 years old (p < 0. 05 for each comparison). Logistic regression analysis revealed a 1. 81 -fold increase in the likelihood of detecting coronary calcification in the atherosclerotic lesions of men compared with those in women (95 % confidence interval 1. 12 to 2. 93, p = 0. 016) when controlled for age and severity of coronary disease by angiography. Conclusions. Atherosclerotic lesions in women are less likely to have coronary calcium than lesions with a similar degree of lumen narrowing in men. Differences in the pattern of coronary calcification between men and women may provide insight into the gender differences observed in the clinical development of symptomatic coronary artery disease...|$|E

Fifty patients who underwent fluoroscopy and <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> were also evaluated. Twenty contiguous 3 mm slices were obtained of the proximal coronary arteries. Total calcium scores were calculated based on the number, areas and peak Hounsfield computed tomographic numbers of the calcific lesions detected. In 88 subjects scored by two readers independently, interobserver agreement was excellent with identical total scores obtained in 70. <b>Ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> was more sensitive than fluoroscopy, detecting coronary calcium in 90 % versus 52 % of patients. There were significant differences (p < 0. 0001) in mean total calcium scores for those with versus those without clinical coronary artery disease by decade: 5 versus 132, age 30 to 39 years; 27 versus 291, age 40 to 49 years; 83 versus 462, age 50 to 59 years; and 187 versus 786, age 60 to 69 years. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for clinical coronary artery disease were calculated for several total calcium scores in each decade. For age groups 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 years, a total score of 50 resulted in a sensitivity of 71 % and 74 % and a of 91 % and 70 %, respectively.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography,</b> a {{new high}} spatial and {{temporal}} resolution imaging system, was employed to define the range of sectional (tomographic) and segmental left ventricular function in 11 normal anesthetized dogs and 11 normal human volunteers. After intravenous infusion of contrast agent, multilevel tomographic images of the left ventricle (apex to base) were acquired {{at a rate of}} 17 frames/s. Analysis of these studies demonstrated substantial but predictable heterogeneity in left ventricular contraction from apex to base. In dogs and humans, for example, the average tomographic ejection fraction of the most basal level of the left ventricle was 40 % less than that of the most apical level (p < 0. 05). In humans, circumferential segmental cavity contraction at the mid-papillary muscle level was relatively homogeneous (range 50 to 92 % for 12 wedge-shaped segments around the tomographic circumference) if the reference system employed an endocardial centroid, but was less uniform if it used an epicardial centroid (range 22 to 98 %). It is concluded that contraction of the normal left ventricle in dogs and humans is heterogeneous both between levels (apex to base) and within a single level (circumferential cavity contraction). However, the patterns of cavity contraction from apex to base and circumferential segmentai cavity contraction within a given level as defined by <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> are sufficiently narrow and predictable in normal individuals that these variables may be useful to define regional contraction abnormalities in pathologic conditions...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of the recently developed echocardiographic on-line endocardial border detection system using <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography,</b> an independent and proved tomographic imaging modality. Background. The automated system for on-line endocardial border detection identifies the blood-tissue interface by acoustic quantification of the ultrasonic backscatter signal. Methods. Eighteen subjects were screened by conventional echocardiography and acoustic quantification. Ten of these, with high quality echocardiographic images, were also examined by <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography.</b> Comparable image planes at the midpapillary level were analyzed. Measurements of left ventricular cavity area were compared at end-diastole and end-systole and time course analyses of cavity area during the cardiac cycle were performed. Results. There was good correlation between values for left ventricular end-diastolic area (r = 0. 99), end-systolic area (r = 0. 93) and fractional area change (r = 0. 91) using the two methods. The on-line backscatter system underestimated end-diastolic area (p < 0. 001), but the negative bias was small (− 1. 6 cm 2) and the 95 % confidence intervals were narrow (− 3. 6 cm 2 to + 0. 4 cm 2). In contrast, the backscatter system overestimated end-systolic area (p < 0. 02); the positive bias for this variable was also small (+ 2. 6 cm 2) but the confidence intervals were relatively wide (+ 7. 9 to − 2. 8 cm 2). The negative bias of backscatter values for cavity area was fairly constant during diastole and early systole (range − 5 % to − 10 %), but during the second half of systole, backscatter values increased progressively relative to computed tomographic values. Real time values for fractional area change measured by the backscatter system were 13 % smaller than those determined by <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (p < 0. 001), with wide confidence intervals (+ 3 % to − 30 %). Absolute peak rates of area change during systole and diastole were lower by 39 % (p < 0. 001) and 41 % (p < 0. 01), respectively, using the on-line ultrasonic backscatter system. Time course analyses revealed the errors to be consistent with cardiac cycle-dependent alterations in gain sensitivity of the ultrasonic backscatter system. Conclusions. The ultrasonic backscatter system is associated with cyclic cavity area measurement errors that need to be addressed if its early promise for on-line assessment of ventricular function is to be fulfilled. Incorporation of an electrocardiographically triggered time-varying gain control may improve accuracy for on-line analysis of ventricular performance...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} measurement accuracy of cardiac output in humans by comparing the indicatordilution technique with geometric analysis by <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography.</b> Background. <b>Ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> can be used to measure cardiac output by two methods. First, by scanning to obtain end-systolic and end-diastolic short-axis images of the ventricular cavities at sequential tomographic levels, the stroke volume and therefore the cardiac output can be calculated. Second, indicator-dilution theory (the Stewart-Hamilton equation) can be applied to measurements of the concentration of radiographic contrast in the blood pool after a bolus injection. The latter method has not been validated in humans. Methods. The accuracy of the geometric method itself was first established by comparing left and right ventricular stroke volumes in 29 patients without valvular regurgitation or an intracardiac shunt, whose left and right ventricular stroke volumes should have been identical (group A). In a subset of 17 patents, the geometric method was compared with the indicator-dilution method (group B). Results. Geometric analysis showed that the mean difference between left and right ventricular stroke volume was 1. 8 ± 7. 3 ml, with a percentage SD of the differences of 9. 3 % (r = 0. 9). Comparison with indicator dilution-calculated cardiac output showed a mean difference of 0. 079 ± 1. 22 liters/min, with a percent SD of the differences of 23. 7 % (r = 0. 6). There was no improvement in this comparison with individual calibration of the scanner for each patient. Conclusions. The disparity found between data obtained with the geometric and indicator-dilution methods may be a result of the hemodynamic effects of contrast medium or it may suggest the possibility that some assumptions of indicator-dilution theory are not valid...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBecause a {{significant}} number of all patients seen by cardiologists have had coronary bypass surgery, a relatively noninvasive method of assessing coronary bypass graft patency would be very helpful. <b>Ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography,</b> by virtue of its rapid data acquisition time and reasonable spatial resolution, may be useful in this regard. To determine the sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of this imaging modality as compared with cardiac catheterization, a multicenter study was undertaken. There were two parts to the study. Part I involved the evaluation of 179 grafts in 74 patients studied in the five participating centers between March 1985 and August 1986. Twenty-nine percent of these graft studies were found to be technically inadequate and were excluded before patency determinations began. The remaining group of 127 bypass grafts in 62 patients had studies adequate for interpretation. Fifty-one grafts werl to the left anterior descending coronary artery or a diagonal branch, 37 to branches of the left circumflex artery and 28 to the right coronary artery or a posterior descending vessel; in addition, there were 11 internal mammary artery bypass grafts primarily into the left anterior descending or diagonal artery distribution. The sensitivity of detecting angiographically open grafts was 93. 4 %, the specificity of detecting angiographically closed grafts 88. 9 % and the predictive accuracy was 92. 1 %. A subsequent study (Part 2) was performed 9 months later to assess the ability to carry out technically adequate examinations.

40|$|Recent advancements in imaging {{technology}} enable the noninvasive assessment of atherosclerotic plaques in arteries throughout the body. High-resolution multisclice computed tomography (MSCT) - {{sometimes referred to}} as multidetector spriral or just MDCT - and cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) provide information about the arterial wall that is unavailable with the most other methods, including angiography. Moreover, MSCT and MR are making great strides in the characterizatuion of plaque composition and microanatomy, thus leading to the identification of lesions that are vulnerable to rupture or erosion.

40|$|ABSTRACT Current imaging {{modalities}} {{can provide}} only a qualitative or semiquantitative {{measure of the}} severity of aortic regurgitation. <b>Ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) has the capability of rapid imaging (17 frames/sec) coupled with high spatial resolution (1. 5 mm 2). Eight millimeter thick images can be acquired to interrogate simultaneously the right and left ventricles. End-diastolic and end-systolic tomograms can be reconstructed serially from apex to base by Simpson's rule to provide end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes from which the right and left ventricular stroke volumes can be derived. To determine whether the difference between left and right ventricular stroke volume measured with ultrafast CT could be used to estimate the volume of experimentally induced aortic regurgitation, we studied six dogs in which proximal aortic electromagnetic flow probes had been implanted. Varying degrees of aortic regurgitation were induced by manipulation of a basket catheter through the aortic valve. During suspended respiration in the control state in the absence of aortic regurgitation, right and left ventricular stroke volumes measured with ultrafast CT were nearly identical (mean difference 1. 0 + 1. 2 ml [mean ± SE]). In the presence of varying degrees of aortic regurgitation, regurgitant volume derived by ultrafast CT as {{the difference between right and}} left ventricular stroke volumes correlated closely to the regurgitant volume measured by the electromagnetic flow probe (r =. 99, slope =. 92...|$|E
40|$|In {{differentiating}} coronary calcium from artifact by <b>ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (UFCT), {{many different}} thresholds have been proposed. UFCT has demonstrated a high sensitivity and only modest specificity to detect coronary calcifications {{when compared to}} angiography. The Agatston method is most widely used today, utilizing a minimum CT number of 130 Hounsfield units (HU). In an attempt to improve specificity without markedly reducing sensitivity, we evaluated 272 coronary vessels from 68 patients with angiography and UFCT coronary scanning. All patients underwent coronary angiography for clinical indications, and had UFCT scanning done within {{three months of the}} angiogram. A blinded reader evaluated all the UFCT scans. We then varied the minimum CT number to assess whether 130 HU was truly the best threshold. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for different thresholds are listed. Threshold 130 HU 150 HU 170 HU 200 HUSensitivity 95 % 92 % 89 % 87 %Specificity 65 % 72 % 75 % 78 %Accuracy 72 % 77 % 78 % 79 %The results above indicate that 130 HU is too low a threshold to maximize accuracy of this test when compared with angiography. Sensitivity is reduced as the threshold is improved, however this result is not significant (p= 0. 61). The improved specificity from 130 to 150 represents a significant improvement (p< 0. 0001), although a larger study must be performed before widespread use of this new threshold is employed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ultrafast</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) {{was used}} to {{evaluate}} the relation of coronary artery calcium, a marker of atherosclerosis, with a reported history of coronary artery disease (CAD) in 928 men and 290 women (mean age 53 +/- 10 years; 11 % with previous CAD). Total calcium score was calculated as the sum of each lesion-specific score, calculated as the product of pixel area and density > 130 Hounsfeld units. Total score was 3 to 6 times greater (p < 0. 01) and the probability of coronary artery calcium 30 to 40 % greater (p < 0. 01) in patients with a reported history of myocardial infarction, positive angiography, bypass surgery or angioplasty. From score cutoffs ranging from 1 to 500 for defining calcium, a negative test was accurate 93 to 98 % of the time in ruling out CAD, whereas specificity increased from 43 to 93 %; however, sensitivity decreased from 92 to 42 %. A score cutoff of 50 showed modest sensitivity (78 %) and specificity (71 %); however, the predictive value for CAD from a positive test remained low (< or = 40 %), regardless of score cutoff. From multiple logistic regression, total score was also an independent indicator of CAD after considering any effects due to age, sex and other CAD risk factors. Further study is needed to document the long-term prognostic use of coronary calcium screening, including criteria that best project future risk of CAD...|$|E

We aimed to compare the accuracy of non-contrast spiral <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> with ultrasonography in the evaluation of patients with renal colic. Fourty-one patients with flank pain were examined with both <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> and ultrasonography over a period of 11 months.

40|$|Accurate {{diagnosis}} and preoperative planning in modern otorhinolaryngology is strongly supported by imaging with enhanced visualization. <b>Computed</b> <b>tomography</b> {{is often used}} to examine structures within bone frameworks. Given the hazards of ionizing radiation, repetitive imaging studies exponentially increase the risk of damages to radiosensitive tissues. The authors compare multislice and cone-beam <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> and determine the role, advantages and disadvantages of cone-beam <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> in otorhinolaryngological imaging. They summarize the knowledge from the international literature and their individual imaging studies. They conclude that cone-beam <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> enables high-resolution imaging and reconstruction in any optional plane and in space with considerably lower effective radiation dose. Cone-beam <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> with appropriate indications proved to be an excellent diagnostic tool in otorhinolaryngological imaging.
