40|$|An {{analysis}} 1 {{was conducted}} to estimate the likelihood of underclassifying ocular corrosives or severe irritants when using the current sequential three animal in vivo rabbit eye test method based on existing protocol guidelines (e. g., OECD 2002) and the United Nations (UN) Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (UN 2003). The analysis {{was based on a}} database of 128 substances classified as GHS Category 1 irritants (i. e., corrosives and severe irritants) based on 142 studies using a total of 661 rabbits. To conduct this analysis, individual rabbit responses were first classified according to the GHS classification system (UN 2003). The estimated <b>underclassification</b> rate was then calculated three ways, each using a different assumption. Calculation 1 assumed homogeneity of response for GHS Category 1 irritants; Calculation 2 assumed heterogeneity of response for GHS Category 1 irritants; and Calculation 3 assumed homogeneity of response for three subgroups of GHS Category 1 irritants. The three subgroups were: (1) strong responders, where all treated rabbits expressed a severe response; (2) moderate responders, where the majority but not all treated rabbits expressed a severe response; and (3) weak responders, where the majority of treated rabbits expressed a nonsevere irritant or nonirritant response. Using the three calculation methods, the estimated <b>underclassification</b> rates for the total databas...|$|E
40|$|Whether {{officials}} {{can be trusted}} to protect national security information has {{become a matter of}} great public controversy, reigniting a long-standing debate about the scope and nature of official secrecy. The declassification of millions of electronic records has made it possible to analyze these issues with greater rigor and precision. Using machine-learning methods, we examined nearly a million State Department cables from the 1970 s to identify features of records that {{are more likely to be}} classified, such as international negotiations, military operations, and high-level communications. Even with incomplete data, algorithms can use such features to identify 90 % of classified cables with < 11 % false positives. But our results also show that there are longstanding problems in the identification of sensitive information. Error analysis reveals many examples of both overclassification and <b>underclassification.</b> This indicates both the need for research on inter-coder reliability among officials as to what constitutes classified material and the opportunity to develop recommender systems to better manage both classification and declassification...|$|E
40|$|Acute poisonings from {{chemicals}} and products {{continue to be}} a significant public health problem. Development of the Up-and-Down Procedure for acute oral systemic toxicity testing has reduced the number of animals used by 70 % while continuing to provide accurate classification and labeling for human health hazards. U. S. regulatory agencies also require acute dermal systemic toxicity testing for {{chemicals and}} products to estimate their potential to cause life-threatening or fatal toxicity from skin exposures. The resulting estimated lethal dose (LD 50) values are used for acute dermal exposure hazard classification and labeling in order to protect {{human health and the environment}} during the handling, transport, and use of chemicals. With the objective of reducing the number of animals used for acute dermal systemic toxicity testing while maintaining the protection of human health for acute dermal exposures, NICEATM analyzed acute oral systemic toxicity data to determine its usefulness for assigning acute dermal systemic toxicity hazard categories for a wide range of chemicals. LD 50 values were collected for 427 substances that had both acute oral and dermal data. Using oral data to classify dermal toxicity hazard categories underclassified 30 % (126 / 427) and overclassified 34 % (146 / 427) of the substances using the hazard classification categories in the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. <b>Underclassification</b> of substances is less protective of public health and would fail to appropriately notify material handlers of chemical hazards while overclassification could desensitize them to such hazards. Therefore, acute oral toxicity data should not be used for classifying dermal toxicity hazards because it would underclassify or overclassify a substantial proportion of substances...|$|E
