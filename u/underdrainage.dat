50|$|This {{treatment}} {{does not}} place a foreign {{body into the}} patient {{so there is a}} much lower risk of infection as compared to a shunt procedure. Along with not implanting a device, this procedure avoids mechanical issues like disconnection, over or <b>underdrainage,</b> and valve dysfunction. The surgery begins by entering the right or left lateral ventricle endoscopically through a burr hole. The third ventricle is identified and entered as well, and an incision is made in the floor of the ventricle and enlarged as necessary with tools such as forceps or Fogarty catheters. If a membrane prevents CSF flow between the ventricle and the subarachnoid space, then an incision is made in the membrane as well. Ideally this procedure can be performed near the midline of the brain with minimal side-to-side motions of the endoscope so as to not tear tissues and cause further complications.|$|E

50|$|At the Oregon Station on {{clay soil}} {{it was found}} that the day {{droppings}} from 200 laying hens on an acre m² per hen in four years made the soil too rich for the successful growth of cereal crops where cropping the ground was done every other year.

40|$|Background: Modern valves for the shunt-therapy of {{hydrocephalus}} {{reduce the}} risk of overdrainage but increase the risk of <b>underdrainage.</b> The valve system proGAV combines a gravitational unit with an adjustable differential pressure valve for a non-invasive regulation of the opening pressure. We evaluated if over- or <b>underdrainage</b> can effectively be regulated by means of a proGAV adjustment. Material and methods: We analysed the data of 114 consecutive patients (63. 2 % male, 36. 8 % female) aged between 15 and 93 years (55. 9  ±  17. 5 years) who underwent the implantation of a shunt with proGAV because of different etiologies: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH, 35. 1 %), posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (postHHC, 28. 1 %), hypertensive/pediatric hydrocephalus (HHC, 21. 1 %), secondary normal pressure hydrocephalus (SNPH, 10. 5 %), and pseudotumour cerebri (PTC, 5. 3 %). 22 patients (27. 1 %) had been revised after complications following the implantatation of a conventional valve system. The follow-up was 30. 8  ±  11. 5 months. Results: For the majority of patients we initially chose an opening pressure of 5  cmH 2 O at the programmable unit except for the patients suffering from pseudotumour cerebri with an initial opening pressure up to 14  cmH 2 O. The initial opening pressure could be maintained in 53. 5 % of all patients during the entire observational period. In the remaining 46. 5 % the opening pressure was adjusted once to three times due to a primary overdrainage (11. 4 %) or <b>underdrainage</b> (35. 1 %). Despite of cautious adjustment settings some secondary underdrainages (n = 5) or overdrainages (n = 6) occured. All of them could be intercepted by repeated adjustments. The need for a consecutive adjustment of opening pressure was independent from patient parameters like height and weight and largely also from the hydrocephalus etiology. Radiologically 42. 6 % of patients showed no regression of their extended ventricles. However, the clinical results were excellent or good in 73. 6 % of patients, and only in 4. 4 % they were bad. There was no correlation between the clinical and the radiological results neither for the entire group nor for the subgroups of different hydrocephalus types. Conclusions: Similar to other valve systems the use of a proGAV valve may result in an overdrainage or functional <b>underdrainage.</b> These shunt complications are easy to treat by simple epicutaneous adjustments without the previously required revision surgery, particularly in overdrainages which are more dangerous as compared to <b>underdrainage.</b> The valve adjustment may result in a secondary under-/overdrainage, therefore in the majority of cases the opening pressure should be regulated in small steps. Because of the frequent gap between clinical and radiological results and because of the small sample sizes of subgroups we cannot conclude which patients will benefit most of this adjustable hydrostatic valve. Prospective randomized multicenter studies with large numbers of cases are meaningful and necessary...|$|E

40|$|The {{pediatric}} gravity assisted valve paediGAV {{has become}} a standard device in some European hydrocephalus centers. As comparative studies on valve design so far did not include this valve, the treatment failure rates of paediGAV were studied in a prospective non randomized uncontrolled multicenter study. 160 hydrocephalic children up to 16 years of age undergoing their first cerebrospinal fluid shunt insertion (59 %), or receiving a paediGAV {{as a substitute for}} any standard differential pressure valve (41 %) were monitored for a minimum of 20 months. Endpoints were defined as valve failure from infection, <b>underdrainage</b> or overdrainage. 38 patients (24 %) reached an endpoint, 13 (7 %) for infection, 18 (11 %) for <b>underdrainage</b> and 7 (4 %) for overdrainage. Another 21 (%) patients were submitted to a valve preserving catheter revision without further detrimental suites for the valve during follow up. 101 patients (63 %) had an uncomplicated clinical course without any subsequent surgery. There was a significant lower rate of valve survival in children younger than 1 year in comparison to children older than 1 year (69 % vs. 80 %). Valve preserving catheter revisions did not influence valve survival. These results compare favourably with recently published series. The use of a gravity assisted valve in children does not significantly affect the rate of early complications compared to other studies. Valve preserving shunt revisions do not increase the risk of subsequent valve failure. As current data do not support a meaningful impact of any well established valve design on the early complication rate in shunt surgery, this frequently used correlation seems to hold a very low validity and therefore should be abandoned. Regarding the known long lasting periods of clinical compensation of non physiological CSF diversion, the investigation of valve properties needs expanded long-term protocols focussing on aspects of quality of life and their largely unknown correlation to morphologic or surgical criteria...|$|E

Even when literally hundreds of different models have been proposed, developed, and tested, overdrainage has plagued all shunts for the last 60 years. Several investigations have demonstrated that changes in the posture of the subject induce unavoidable and drastic differences of intraventricular hydrokinetic pressure and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage through the shunt. Of all the parameters that participate in the pathophysiology of hydrocephalus, the only invariable one is cerebrospinal fluid production at a constant rate of approximately 0. 35 ml/min. However, this feature has not been considered in the design of currently available shunts.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{treating}} idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) with a shunt {{there is}} always a risk of <b>underdrainage</b> or overdrainage. The hypothesis is tested whether patients treated using an adjustable valve preset at the highest opening pressure leads to comparable good clinical results with less subdural effusions than in a control group with an opening pressure preset at a low pressure level. METHODS: A multicentre prospective randomised trial was performed on a total of 58 patients suspected of INPH. Thirty patients were assigned to (control) group 1 and received a Strata shunt (Medtronic, Goleta, USA) with the valve preset at a performance level (PL) of 1. 0, while 28 patients were assigned to group 2 and received a Strata shunt with the valve preset at PL 2. 5. In this group the PL was allowed to be lowered until improvement or radiological signs of overdrainage were met. RESULTS: Significantly more subdural effusions were observed in the improved patients of group 1. There was no statistically significant difference in improvement between both groups overall.

The direct drainage can be separated by different methods (modificated semi-graphical method, GROUND method, method of hydrogram separation, method of digitals filtres) or CN- curves can be used for calculation. This thesis used the method of CN curves to process the results of a given drainage area.

40|$|Introduction: Shunting {{systems are}} {{implanted}} for draining cerebrospinal fluid to treat hydrocephalus, intracranial cysts, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Most shunt systems include a valve which regulates drainage. A differential pressure valve opens when intracranial pressure exceeds the valve’s opening pressure. The difficulty with these valves is selecting and predicting {{the most suitable}} valve opening pressure for the individual patient after insertion. Using a valve with a non-adjustable opening pressure requires surgery to change the opening pressure. Potentially, an adjustable valve, such as the Codman Hakim programmable valve, allows non-invasive valve pressure-adjustment for managing over- and <b>underdrainage</b> {{by being able to}} fine-tune the valve's opening pressure to the patient’s changing intracranial hydrodynamics. Objective: To evaluate the use of an adjustable valve in a consecutive, non-selected group of patients. To evaluate its reliance, spectrum of complications, use and effects of opening pressure adjustments and economical impact. Results and conclusions: An adjustable valve has the advantage of enabling trans-cutaneous alterations of the valve's opening pressure as the patients’ clinical course changes during the postoperative period. Pressure-adjustment optimized treatment, and clinical outcome improved following the majority of adjustments. Subdural fluid collections could be managed with pressure-adjustment. The rate of shunt complications was similar to other studies. Valve malfunction was uncommon. Accidental pressure-resetting, other than that caused by magnetic resonance imaging, was rare. Avoided shunt revisions reduce cost. Because we cannot predict which patient will need pressure-adjustment, our preference is to use an adjustable valve for all conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{solution and}} numerical {{results of the}} effect of size and disposition of perforations in a well casing have been obtained. The solution is for steady state flow in a confined horizontal aquifer from an external boundary of constant potential head to a series of equally spaced rectangular perforations (three-dimensional space) at equal constant potential on a well surface. The solution includes flow into continuous vertical slots (two-dimensional) and into ring openings (three-dimensional space, two coordinates). For simplicity, it was assumed that Darcy 2 ̆ 7 s law is valid and the flow medium is homogeneous and isotropic. The exact analytical solution of the potential flow problem that satisfies Laplace 2 ̆ 7 s equation in polar coordinates and the mixed boundary conditions was developed by converting the Kirkham and Powers (1972) modified Gram-Schmidt process for two-dimensional space to three-dimensional space. This method of solution is very lengthy because of the three-dimensional nature of the problem. A simpler and sufficiently accurate solution was developed for homogeneous boundary conditions by use of Fourier series. The numerical result using the approximate method was found to give good results in comparison with the exact mixed boundary solution for certain parameters. The results of the approximate solution also showed that the flow into rectangular perforations (three-dimensional problem) can be approximated, using the flow analysis into continuous vertical slots, for a number of perforation geometries used in practice, provided that the percentage of open to unopen space of comparison is the same;The solution of the perforation problem includes an exact analytical solution, with numerical results, of the problem of continuous vertical well casing slots. The numerical results of this solution are tabulated {{for a wide range of}} parameters. These results showed that the flow into perforations can be found with a great degree of accuracy at locations less than 1 cm distance from the well surface and thus in the region where the largest hydraulic gradients occur;The basic theory and the numerical results also apply to flow into perforations in drain tubes used in land <b>underdrainage.</b> The numerical results in this study are presented as dimensionless parameters so that the flow for any particular system or units can readily be found...|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the interrelationship between aggregate stability and microbial biomass in restored soils, and to investigate if {{the development of the}} two parameters in soils disturbed by opencast mining could be influenced by the application of slow release organic amendments. These objectives were tested using two microbiological methods; determination of adenosine triphosphate and dehydrogenase activity, and three structural measurements; determination of aggregate stability by wet-sieving, shear vane and bulk density. Soil carbon and nitrogen were also determined. The first part of the study involved a survey of 16 field areas located in Britain, 12 disturbed and four not disturbed by opencast coal mining. The areas were all grasslands which varied in the time since restoration, which was between 0 - 16 years. A log linear relationship between the soil biomass and stable aggregates > 2 mm was found for all field areas (y = 38 In x - 69, r = 0. 51). The variation in both properties was also affected by the restoration practices at the individual sites. A cluster analysis of the measured soil properties separated the restored areas into "good" restorations, involving progressive restoration, topsoil replacement and early <b>underdrainage,</b> and "poor" restorations, restored without topsoil or with soil forming material. The second part of the study reported on the first 16 months of a field trial set up on a recently restored opencast coal site situated near Denby in Derbyshire in 1991. A 3 x 4 factorial design involved two organic amendments (straw and wood), and four vegetation covers. The treatment effects were obscured by natural fluctuations in the soil properties over the period studied. However, the presence of the organic amendments alleviated some of the physical problems of the soil, such as waterlogging and frost damage, which drastically affected the results in 1992. The soil properties generally improved in the order straw>wood>no amendment for the majority of soil parameters (structure, C and N), the notable exception being the soil microbiological parameters which varied substantially throughout the experiment.

40|$|In this {{clinical}} trial first clinical {{experiences with the}} new valve proGAV will be introduced. proGAV is a programmable hydrostatic gravity assisted valve, that has been implanted in 40 adult patients with communicating hydrocephalus of different etiology. The etiology is split on 15 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, 9 patients with hydrocephalus malresorptivus, 9 patients with hypertensive hydrocephalus, 6 patients with secondary normal pressure hydrocephalus and one patient with pseudotumor cerebri. The primary opening pressure varied between 5 and 8 cm H 2 O, the gravitational unit was chosen depending on the body height of the patient. The clinical outcome according to the NPH-Recovery-Rate proves, that a total of 89, 3 % of the patients benefitted from a shunt therapy. According to the scale of Stein & Langfitt only 10, 8 % of the patients were able to manage their household on their own before the operation, after the operation the percentage increased to 67, 6 %. According to the scale of Black a total of 97, 3 % showed an improvement, 75, 7 % demonstrated an even very good or good postoperative developing. All in all the neuro-imaging showed a tendency to only a minimal reduction of the ventricle width. We found a correlation between the radiologically noticed reduction of the ventricle width and the clinical outcome according to Stein & Langfitt, {{but there was no}} correlation found between the reduction of the ventricle width and the clinical outcome based on the Kiefer-Score. We observed one malposition of the ventricle catheter and two shunt infections (5, 3 %) in terms of valve-unrelated complications. There were no obstructions of the valve. During the survey three patients died from their underlying disease independent from the shunt therapy. In terms of valve-related complications we observed overdrainage in 5 cases (13, 16 %, four hygromas and one subdural hematoma), of which two were regressing spontaneously. The other three patients were helped by adjusting the opening pressure. In 14 cases (36, 8 %) we observed a functional <b>underdrainage.</b> Of these 14 patients a considerable improvement of the pathology could be achieved in seven cases by adjusting the opening pressure. There were a total of 0, 73 adjustments of the opening pressure per patient and - considered differently - 1, 5 adjustments per patient, whose opening pressure was adjusted at least once. Concerning the clinical outcome - including the adjustments of the opening pressure - 43, 2 % of our patients had a good or very good result immediately after the operation. After the adjustments the percentage increased to 75, 7 % (good or very good according to Black). Therefore 66, 7 % of the patients, whose opening pressure was adjusted, benefitted considerably from this possibility. The break release, the measurements and the adjustments of the opening pressure were uncomplicated and secure. We didn´t observe any spontaneous or MRI-related adjustments of the opening pressure. Altogether the clinical and radiological results indicate an advantage of proGAV over other valves and they justify its application in hydrocephalus diseases of all analyzed etiologies. However an accurate comparison is not possible until now - on the one hand because of the still to small sample size, on the other hand because of the internationally non-standardized study-design and the different definitions.

40|$|In the {{classical}} design method for gravity dams, the designs are {{conducted in the}} linear elastic isotropic material domain. For many decades the so-called ‘classical method’ (or conventional method) was used to design gravity dams. This method {{is based on the}} Bernoulli shallow beam theory. Despite much criticism expressed by academics regarding the basis of the theory, dam design engineers are still using {{the classical}} method to design gravity dams. Currently, in most dam building countries the various codes of practice are standardised and based on this method, and engineers have confidence in these codes. This state of affairs will probably continue until structural engineers come up with a viable alternative for designing gravity dams more precisely. The perception of increased risk is always a critical aspect to overcome when introducing an alternative design method, especially when the established, well-known methodology has proved to be safe. However, when so-called ‘back analyses’ are performed on existing dams, it is not so straightforward to assess the safety margin of these structures. Material properties and their yielding or failure characteristics are now becoming important in evaluating these structures accurately in the non-linear domain. With the growing popularity of roller compacted concrete as a dam building material, the attractiveness of gravity dams has also increased and the author is of the opinion that the finite element method could be utilised more efficiently to optimise gravity dams. But, as with any new or alternative design method, the parameters and means of evaluation should be developed to establish a workable and reliable technique. The objective of this dissertation is to develop a practical methodology for the non-linear analysis of gravity dams by means of the non-linear finite element method. A further aspect of this dissertation is the inclusion of a broad guideline on the application of the latest dam design standards used in South Africa for both the classical and finite element methods. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the basic design criteria, a literature survey was conducted on the evolution of dams and the various theories developed in the past to design and optimise gravity dams. The literature survey included the examination of gravity dam safety criteria and some available statistics on dam failures. The International Committee on Large Dams (ICOLD) has interesting statistics on dam failures and their causes. A few typical dam failures are presented to illustrate what can go wrong. During this literature research, a thorough study was done on the non-linear material theory, with special reference to the Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker Prager material models. The findings of the study are used to illustrate how the non-linear material models are incorporated into the finite element method and in what manner the different material parameters have an influence on the accuracy of the results. As already mentioned, currently the classical method is still a recognised design standard and for this reason a summary is presented of the South African Department of Water Affairs and Forestry’s practice for designing gravity dams. This includes the latest concepts on load combinations and factors of safety for these load conditions. This summary of current practice is used as a stepping stone for the proposed load combinations that could be used for the finite element method as these are not always compatible. However, this dissertation does not deal with the full spectrum of load combinations and the scope is limited to hydrostatic loads. Although the finite element method is a very powerful structural engineering tool, it has some serious potential deficiencies when used for dam design. The most serious problem concerns the singularities and mesh density, which develop high stress peaks at the heel of the dam wall. This problem is illustrated and some practical finite element examples are given. Some solutions for addressing this problem are also presented. It is concluded that an effective method for overcoming the singularity problem is to use the non-linear material yielding model. In order to calibrate the non-linear Drucker Prager model, several finite element benchmarks were conducted, based on work done by other researchers in the fracture mechanics field. Although the theory of the Drucker Prager model is not based on fracture mechanics principles, this model simulates the failure of the concrete material very well. To demonstrate this, various benchmarks were conducted, such as a pure tension specimen, a beam in pure bending, a beam combined with bending and shear, the flow models of Chen (1982), a model of a gravity dam and, finally, a full-size gravity dam. The next step in the study was to calibrate the Drucker Prager model with the concrete material properties used in existing dams of different construction methods and ages. The material strength of the concrete was statistically analysed and the average strength was calculated. The important ratio of tensile strength to compression strength (ƒt/ƒc) was also examined and the findings are presented. This ratio is important to get accurate results from the Drucker Prager model. The normal input parameters for the Drucker Prager model are the internal friction angle of the material (φ) and the cohesion (c). Scrutiny of the work done by Chen (1982) helped to find a useful solution to obtaining the parameters for the non-linear finite element method without determining the ö and c values, but by using the material tensile and compression strengths instead. The formulation is demonstrated in the chapter on theory. To illustrate the usefulness of the non-linear yielding model a few case studies were conducted. A hypothetical triangular gravity dam structure was analysed because it was widely used in other literature studies and a useful comparison could be made. Then, a case study of an 80 -year-old concrete gravity dam was performed. The uniqueness of this dam lies in the fact that it was designed before the theory of <b>underdrainage</b> was used in South Africa and the dam has a characteristic shape due to its relatively steep downstream slopes compared with today’s standards. A study of material strength sensitivity was also done on this dam to evaluate its stability under severe load conditions. The last case study presented is on a recently designed 75 -m-high roller compacted concrete gravity dam, optimised primarily by the classical method. The non-linear Drucker Prager yield model was used to evaluate this structure, with the actual material strengths taken from the laboratory design mix results. Although the finite element method was used during the design stage of this dam, it was used mainly to check the results of the classical method. The finite element method was also used to do studies on this dam where the classical method could not be used, such as studies of temperature and earthquake load conditions (not included in this research). The factor of safety against sliding was also determined using the results obtained from the finite element method and compared with the results obtained from the classical method. This case study gives an approximate comparison between the classical method and the finite element method. Finally, a methodology is proposed for analysing a gravity dam. Procedural steps are given to describe the methodology. With regard to the future, the advantage of the non-linear finite element method is that it can easily be extended to contemporary 3 -D analysis, still using the same concept. Many dams can only be accurately evaluated by a full 3 -D analysis. There is a modern tendency to design gravity dams in 3 -D as well so as to evaluate their stability against sliding in the longitudinal direction. The non-linear 3 -D finite element method is also used for arch dams, for which very few alternative numerical analysis methods are available. Moreover, the non-linear finite element method can be extended to earth and rock-fill embankments. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009. Civil Engineeringunrestricte...|$|E
