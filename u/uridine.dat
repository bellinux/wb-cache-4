25|$|Despite these advances, it was {{not until}} Ardhendu Mukherjee and W. Beermann {{performed}} more advanced autoradiography experiments in 1965 that scientists could confirm that transcription of genes in the single male X chromosome was double that observed in the two female X chromosomes. Mukherjee and Beermann confirmed this by designing a cellular autoradiography experiment that allowed them to visualize incorporation of <b>uridine</b> into ribonucleic acid of the X chromosomes. Their studies showed equal levels of <b>uridine</b> incorporation in the single male X chromosome and the two female X chromosomes. Thus, the investigators concluded that the two-fold increase in the rate of RNA synthesis in the X chromosome of the male relative to those of the female could account for Muller’s hypothesized dosage compensation.|$|E
25|$|If {{the code}} was DNA-based, it {{operated}} as follows. The genetic code was expressed via RNA intermediates, which were single-stranded.

25|$|Nucleotides are {{compounds}} found {{naturally in}} human breast milk. They {{are involved in}} critical metabolic processes, such as energy metabolism and enzymatic reactions. Also, as {{the building blocks of}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), they are essential for normal body functions. Compared to human breast milk, cow's milk has lower levels of the nucleotides <b>uridine,</b> inosine, and cytidine. Therefore, several companies that produce infant formula have added nucleotides to their infant formulas.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{biological}} processes {{that help to}} prevent frameshift mutations. Reverse mutations occur which change the mutated sequence {{back to the original}} wild type sequence. Another possibility for mutation correction is the use of a suppressor mutation. This offsets the effect of the original mutation by creating a secondary mutation, shifting the sequence to allow for the correct amino acids to be read. Guide RNA {{can also be used to}} insert or delete <b>Uridine</b> into the mRNA after transcription, this allows for the correct reading frame.|$|E
25|$|Splicing of mRNA is {{performed}} by an RNA and protein complex {{known as the}} spliceosome, containing snRNPs designated U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 (U3 {{is not involved in}} mRNA splicing). U1 binds to the 5' GU and U2, {{with the assistance of the}} U2AF protein factors, binds to the branchpoint A within the branch site. The complex at this stage is known as the spliceosome A complex. Formation of the A complex is usually the key step in determining the ends of the intron to be spliced out, and defining the ends of the exon to be retained. (The U nomenclature derives from their high <b>uridine</b> content).|$|E

50|$|Pan-editing {{starts with}} the base-pairing of the {{unedited}} primary transcript with a guide RNA (gRNA), which contains complementary sequences to the regions around the insertion/deletion points. The newly formed double-stranded region is then enveloped by an editosome, a large multi-protein complex that catalyzes the editing. The editosome opens the transcript at the first mismatched nucleotide and starts inserting <b>uridines.</b> The inserted <b>uridines</b> will base-pair with the guide RNA, and insertion will continue as long as A or G {{is present in the}} guide RNA and will stop when a C or U is encountered. The inserted nucleotides cause a frameshift, and result in a translated protein that differs from its gene.|$|R
50|$|U98 {{belongs to}} the H/ACA box class of snoRNAs which are thought to guide the sites of {{modification}} of <b>uridines</b> to pseudouridines, the target for this family is unknown.The mouse homologue was cloned and is called MBII-367.|$|R
25|$|This m6A {{modification}} has {{a notable}} effect on translational dynamics. As expected, {{because it is}} just a modified adenosine base, m6A base-pairs with <b>uridine</b> during decoding. However, the adenosine’s methylation hinders tRNA accommodation and translation elongation. When an m6A-modified codon interacts with its cognate tRNA, it acts more like a near-cognate codon interaction instead of the cognate codon interaction. This can be seen in that the delay in the tRNA accommodation, which is dependent upon both the position of the m6A in the mRNA codons and on how accurate the translation is. To summarize, translation-elongation dynamics are slower for codons with m6A and different locations of these modified nucleotides in the mRNA codons affect decoding dynamics in different ways.|$|E
25|$|Regulation of RNR is {{designed}} to maintain balanced quantities of dNTPs. Binding of effector molecules either increases or decreases RNR activity. When ATP binds to the allosteric activity site, it activates RNR. In contrast, when dATP binds to this site, it deactivates RNR. In addition to controlling activity, the allosteric mechanism also regulates the substrate specificity and ensures the enzyme produces {{an equal amount of}} each dNTP for DNA synthesis. In all classes, binding of ATP or dATP to the allosteric site induces reduction of cytidine 5’-diphosphate (CDP) and <b>uridine</b> 5’-diphosphate (UDP); 2’-deoxyguanosine 5’-triphosphate (dGTP) induces reduction of adenosine 5’-diphosphate (ADP); and 2’-deoxythymidine 5’-triphosphate (dTTP) induces reduction of guanosine 5’-diphosphate (GDP) (Figure 1).|$|E
25|$|Glycogen {{synthesis}} is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic—it {{requires the}} input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from <b>uridine</b> triphosphate (UTP), which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in a reaction catalysed by UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose initially by the protein glycogenin, which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules {{have been added to}} a tyrosine residue, the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose. The glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.|$|E

25|$|TK1 is {{synthesized}} by {{the cell}} during the S phase of cell division. After cell division is completed, TK1 is degraded intracellularly {{and does not}} pass to body fluids after normal cell division. There is a feed-back regulation of the action of thymidine kinase in the cell: thymidine triphosphate (TTP), {{the product of the}} further phosphorylation of thymidine, acts as an inhibitor to thymidine kinase. This serves to maintain a balanced amount of TTP available for nucleic acid synthesis, not oversaturating the system. 5'-Aminothymidine, a non-toxic analogue of thymidine, interferes with this regulatory mechanism and thereby increases the cytotoxicity of thymidine analogues used as antineoplastic drugs. The reaction kinetics of thymidine and thymidine analogues phosphorylation is complicated and only partly known. The overall phosphorylation of thymidine to thymidine triphosphate does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the various phosphates of thymidine and <b>uridine</b> interfere with the phosphorylation of each other. The kinetics of TK from different species differ from each other's and also the different forms from a given species (monomer, dimer, tetramer and serum form) have different kinetic characteristics.|$|E
25|$|The {{synthesis}} of bacterial cellulose is a multistep process that involve two main mechanisms: the {{synthesis of}} <b>uridine</b> diphosphoglucose (UDPGIc), followed by the polymerization of glucose into long and unbranched chains (the β-1→4 glucan chain). Specifics on the cellulose synthesis has been extensively documented. The former mechanism is well known while the latter still needs exploring. The production of UDPGIc starts with carbon compounds (such as hexoses, glycerol, dihydroxyacetone, pyruvate, and dicarboxylic acids) entering the Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, or the pentose phosphate cycle depending on what carbon source is available. It then goes through phosphorylation along with catalysis, followed by isomerization of the intermediate, and {{a process known as}} UDPGIc pyrophosphorylase to convert the compounds into UDPGIc, a precursor to the production of cellulose. The polymerization of glucose into the β-1→4 glucan chain has been hypothesized to either involve a lipid intermediate or not to involve a lipid intermediate, though structural enzymology studies and in vitro experiments indicate that polymerization can occur by direct enzymatic transfer of a glucosyl moiety from a nucleotide sugar to the growing polysaccharide. A. xylinum usually converts carbon compounds into cellulose with around 50% efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Pyrimidine ribonucleosides {{and their}} {{respective}} nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesized by a sequence of reactions which by-pass the free sugars, and are assembled in a stepwise fashion by using nitrogenous or oxygenous chemistries. Sutherland has demonstrated high yielding routes to cytidine and <b>uridine</b> ribonucleotides built from small 2 and 3 carbon fragments such as glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, cyanamide and cyanoacetylene. One of the steps in this sequence allows the isolation of enantiopure ribose aminooxazoline if the enantiomeric excess of glyceraldehyde is 60% or greater. This {{can be viewed as}} a prebiotic purification step, where the said compound spontaneously crystallized out from a mixture of the other pentose aminooxazolines. Ribose aminooxazoline can then react with cyanoacetylene in a mild and highly efficient manner to give the alpha cytidine ribonucleotide. Photoanomerization with UV light allows for inversion about the 1' anomeric centre to give the correct beta stereochemistry. In 2009 they showed that the same simple building blocks allow access, via phosphate controlled nucleobase elaboration, to 2',3'-cyclic pyrimidine nucleotides directly, which are known to be able to polymerize into RNA. This paper also highlights the possibility for the photo-sanitization of the pyrimidine-2',3'-cyclic phosphates.|$|E
