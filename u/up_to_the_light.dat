5|$|Even the maps, {{of which}} Tolkien {{originally}} proposed five, were considered and debated. He wished Thror's map to be tipped in (that is, glued {{in after the}} book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the moon-letters (almost identical to Anglo-Saxon runes) on the reverse {{so they could be}} seen when held <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>light.</b> In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thror's map, and the Map of Wilderland, both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.|$|E

Frank Warren promoted Khan's fight against the veteran Barrera, perhaps Khan's highest-profile opponent to date. Barrera was ranked No. 1 and Khan No. 5 in the WBO world lightweight rankings. Previous IBF and WBO lightweight title holder Nate Campbell was stripped of the belts after moving <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> welterweight division and Khan's promoter Frank Warren and Barrera's promoter Don King lobbied the WBO to elevate the Khan-Barrera fight to a world lightweight title eliminator. However, the world-title status was instead given to the fight between Juan Manuel Márquez and Juan Diaz, ranked No. 2 and No. 3 respectively by the WBO.|$|E
25|$|The House of Bourbon, in its {{surviving}} branches, {{is believed}} to be the oldest royal dynasty of Europe (and the oldest documented European family altogether) that is still existing in the direct male line today: The House of Capet's male ancestors, the Robertians, go back to Robert of Hesbaye (d. 807) as their first secured ancestor and he {{is believed to}} be a direct male descendant of Charibert de Haspengau (c. 555–636). Should this be true, only the Imperial House of Japan would outmatch the Bourbon's age, being reliably documented - as a ruling house already - from about 540. The House of Hesse traces its line back to 841, the House of Welf-Este and the House of Wettin are both emerging in the 10th century (and so do some Italian non-ruling houses like the Caetani or the Massimo family), whereas most of the other ruling families of Europe only turn <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of history after the year 1000.|$|E
40|$|An {{array of}} eight CsI(Tl) {{detectors}} {{has been set}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> measure <b>the</b> <b>light</b> charged particles in nuclear reactions using heavy ions from the Pelletron Linac Facility, Mumbai. The energy response of CsI(Tl) detector to α-particles from 5 to 40 MeV is measured using radioactive sources and the ^ 12 C(^ 12 C, α) reaction populating discrete states in ^ 20 Ne. The energy non-linearity and the count rate effect on the pulse shape discrimination property have also been measured and observed the deterioration of pulse shape discrimination with higher count rate.

50|$|Luminous flux (in lumens) is {{a measure}} of the total amount of light a lamp puts out. The {{luminous}} intensity (in candelas) {{is a measure}} of how bright the beam in a particular direction is. If a lamp has a 1 lumen bulb and the optics of the lamp are set <b>up</b> <b>to</b> focus <b>the</b> <b>light</b> evenly into a 1 steradian beam, then the beam would have a luminous intensity of 1 candela. If the optics were changed <b>to</b> concentrate <b>the</b> beam into 1/2 steradian then the source would have a luminous intensity of 2 candela. The resulting beam is narrower and brighter, however the luminous flux remains the same.|$|R
