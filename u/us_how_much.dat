5|$|Vieuxpont {{was one of}} only a few {{supporters}} of the king in northern England, and he most likely began construction of Brougham Castle as soon as he acquired the land. At this stage, the castle would have been enclosed by an earthen bank surmounted by a timber palisade. The first three storeys of the stone keep date from this period. It was entered through the first floor via a forebuilding. To the east of this was a stone structure which was probably a hall. Building in stone was an expensive and time-consuming process. No records tell <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> Brougham cost to construct, but there are records for other stone construction. For example, the late-12th-century stone keep at Peveril Castle in Derbyshire would have cost around £200, although something on a much larger scale, such as the vast Château Gaillard, cost an estimated £15,000 to £20,000 and took several years to complete.|$|E

25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.|$|E

[...] Porter also praised the final scene of the episode, when Jan and Michael drive home after the day. [...] Porter stated [...] "I don't know whether to laugh or turn away in shame from that final scene, though, as they bicker about what to eat while they're driving home. It was like {{watching}} two friends fight – fascinating and incredibly uncomfortable at the same time." [...] Christine Fenno, of Entertainment Weekly, stated The Deposition' was a simmering slow cooker of corporate intrigue, flavored by Michael Scott's ridiculousness, with spicy smack talk on the side." [...] Fenno, like Porter, also praised the acting of Jenna Fischer, saying that she [...] "stole the low-key opening scenes". [...] Travis Fickett, of IGN, stated that [...] "this happens to be the best episode of the season {{and one of the best}} episodes of the series.

[...] Fickett went on to praise the acting between Steve Carell (Michael) and Paul Lieberstein (Toby). [...] BuddyTV Senior Writer Oscar Dahl stated that the episode was an oddity among the series, saying [...] "The Deposition" [...] was an atypical episode of The Office, one that basically put the character of Michael Scott on trial and humiliated him over and over again." ...|$|E

60|$|Two {{men in a}} skiff, whom {{we passed}} hereabouts, {{floating}} buoyantly amid the reflections of the trees, like a feather in mid-air, or a leaf which is wafted gently from its twig to the water without turning over, seemed still in their element, and to have very delicately availed themselves of the natural laws. Their floating there was a beautiful and successful experiment in natural philosophy, and it served to ennoble in our eyes the art of navigation; for as birds fly and fishes swim, so these men sailed.

60|$|We {{have also}} visited Enghien, and Montmorency. The latter, {{as you know}} already, stands {{on the side of}} a low mountain, in plain view of Paris. It is a town of some size, with very uneven streets, some of them being {{actually}} sharp acclivities, and a Gothic church that is seen from afar and that is well worth viewing near by. These quaint edifices afford us deep delight, by their antiquity, architecture, size, and pious histories. What matters it to <b>us</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> or how little superstition may blend with the rites, when we know and feel that we are standing in a nave that has echoed with orisons to God, for a thousand years! This of Montmorency is not quite so old, however, having been rebuilt only three centuries since.|$|E

Men had names of their own long before the Lord Jesus came, long before His Baptism was heard of on earth;--the heathens of old had their names--the heathens have names still;--why, then, did church people feel it right to mix a new thing like baptism with a world-old thing like giving a name? ...|$|E
