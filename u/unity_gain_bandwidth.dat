40|$|The NE 5230 is a {{very low}} voltage {{operational}} amplifier that can perform with a voltage supply as low as 1. 8 V or as high as 15 V. In addition, split or single supplies can be used, and the output will swing to ground when applying the latter. There is a bias adjusting pin which controls the supply current required by the device and thereby controls its power consumption. If the part is operated at ± 0. 9 V supply voltages, the current required is only 110 �A when the current control pin is left open. Even with this low power consumption, the device obtains a typical <b>unity</b> <b>gain</b> <b>bandwidth</b> of 250 kHz. When the bias adjusting pin {{is connected to the}} negative supply, the <b>unity</b> <b>gain</b> <b>bandwidth</b> is typically 600 kHz while the supply current is increased to 600 �A. In this mode, the part will supply full power output beyond the audio range. The NE 5230 also has a unique input stage that allows the common−mode input range to go above the positive and below the negative supply voltages by 250 mV. This provides for the largest possible input voltages for low voltage applications. The part is also internally−compensated to reduce external component count. The NE 5230 has a low input bias current of typically ± 40 nA, and a large open−loop gain of 125 dB. These two specifications are beneficial when using the device in transducer applications. The large open−loop gain gives very accurate signal processing because of the large “excess ” loop gain in a closed−loop system. The output stage is a class AB type that can swing to within 100 mV of the supply voltages for the largest dynamic range that is needed in many applications.

The amplifier needs a high <b>unity</b> <b>gain</b> <b>bandwidth,</b> for a good filter response. The <b>unity</b> <b>gain</b> <b>bandwidth</b> is 830 MHz, but is still not enough for the 255 MHz low-pass filter. The gain of the amplifier at low frequencies is 37 dB and the first pole is at 15 MHz. To find a correct frequency response, the filter equations have to contain the first order pole of the amplifier. This is done by recalculating the response by using Kirchhoff current laws, and not regarding the amplifier gain as ideal. In stead, a first order model of an amplifier with pole will be substituted in the equation. With this equation, {{it is possible to}} find the correct frequency response. The filter is not more sensitive to amplifier gain and pole than it is to the other filter components. For the final filter, the response at 800 MHz is - 40 dB.
