5000|$|The {{majority}} {{held that}} “research” and “private study” {{are consistent with}} instructional purposes {{as long as the}} teachers (the copiers) did not disguise their distinct purposes or conflate it with the research or study purposes of the <b>ultimate</b> <b>user.</b> The teachers had no ulterior motive in providing photocopies to their students. Moreover, instruction cannot be completely segregated from [...] "research" [...] and [...] "private study" [...] because most students require the guidance of teachers to find the materials necessary for their research and private study. [...] "The teacher/copier therefore shares a symbiotic purpose with the student/user who is engaging in research or private study. Instruction and research/private study are, in the school context, tautological". Moreover, the word “private” in “private study” does not mean that users have to study copyrighted works in isolation. [...] "Studying and learning are essentially personal endeavours, whether they are engaged in with others or in solitude".|$|E

50|$|U.S. banks {{offering}} PTA services {{should develop}} and maintain adequate policies, procedures, and processes {{to guard against}} possible illicit use of these accounts.

50|$|Examples {{of legal}} straw {{purchases}} would be purchasing groceries for {{a senior citizen}} who is unable {{to go to a}} supermarket oneself because of poor health, or a financed automobile for someone who cannot obtain it himself because of poor credit. In some cases, the agent in the straw purchase may receive money or recompense from the ultimate possessor. Obtaining loans through a straw buyer is legal except when the agent and <b>ultimate</b> <b>user</b> of the funds defraud the lender or foreseeable ultimate lender (such as by signing false mortgage documents designed to be mingled with other mortgages and securitized) or when the loan terms expressly prohibit use of an agent to obtain funds. In cases where straw purchases are legal despite the good or service purchased not being legal for the end user to receive, the end user may become liable for illegally possessing or receiving the good or service, while the straw buyer who was legally able to make the purchase is generally not held liable for his actions.|$|E
5000|$|Except when {{dispensed}} {{directly by}} a practitioner, {{other than a}} pharmacist, to an <b>ultimate</b> <b>user,</b> no controlled substance in schedule III or IV, which is a prescription drug as determined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 USC 301 et seq.), may be dispensed without a written or oral prescription in conformity with section 503(b) of that Act (21 USC 353 (b)). Such prescriptions may not be filled or refilled {{more than six months}} after the date thereof or be refilled more than five times after the date of the prescription unless renewed by the practitioner. A prescription for controlled substances in Schedules III, IV, and V issued by a practitioner, may be communicated either orally, in writing, or by facsimile to the pharmacist, and may be refilled if so authorized on the prescription or by call-in. Control of wholesale distribution is somewhat less stringent than Schedule II drugs. Provisions for emergency situations are less restrictive within the [...] "closed system" [...] of the Controlled Substances Act than for Schedule II though no schedule has provisions to address circumstances where the closed system is unavailable, nonfunctioning or otherwise inadequate.|$|E
