25|$|Although histone {{modifications}} occur {{throughout the}} entire sequence, the unstructured N-termini of histones (called histone tails) are particularly highly modified. These modifications include acetylation, methylation, <b>ubiquitylation,</b> phosphorylation, sumoylation, ribosylation and citrullination. Acetylation is the most highly studied of these modifications. For example, acetylation of the K14 and K9 lysines of the tail of histone H3 by histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) is generally related to transcriptional competence.|$|E
25|$|Insect cells {{express a}} full size zinc-finger {{transcription}} factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci), which forms a complex with the kinesin-like protein Costal-2 (Cos2) and is localized in the cytoplasm bound to cellular microtubules (Figure 2). The SCF complex targets the 155 kDa full length Ci protein for proteosome-dependent cleavage, which generates a 75 kDa fragment (CiR). CiR builds {{up in the}} cell and diffuses into the nucleus, where it acts as a co-repressor for Hedgehog (Hh) target genes. The steps leading to Ci protein proteolysis include phosphorylation of Ci protein by several protein kinases; PKA, GSK3β and CK1 (Figure 2). The Drosophila protein Slimb {{is part of an}} SCF complex that targets proteins for <b>ubiquitylation.</b> Slimb binds to phosphorylated Ci protein.|$|E
2500|$|The Wnt/β-catenin pathway {{starts with}} the binding of Wnt to a {{receptor}} complex encompassing a Fz receptor and LRP co-receptor. [...] After Wnt binds, an intracellular protein named Dishevelled (Dvl) is activated via phosphorylation. β-catenin degradation complexes in the cytoplasm are composed of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and Axin. [...] APC promotes the degradation of β-catenin by increasing the affinity of the degradation complex to β-catenin. [...] Axin is a scaffolding protein which holds the degradation complex together. [...] The activated Dvl associates with Axin and prevents GSK3β and casein kinase 1α (CK1α) from phosphorylating critical substrates, such as β-catenin. [...] Phosphorylation of β-catenin marks the protein for <b>ubiquitylation</b> and rapid degradation by proteasomes. [...] Thus, the binding of Wnt to the receptor results in a non-phosphorylated form of β-catenin which localizes to the nucleus and, after displacing the Groucho corepressor protein, forms a complex with Tcf/Lef transcription factors and co-activators (such as CREB binding protein) and induces the expression of downstream target genes.|$|E

5000|$|Prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) is a {{functional}} analog of ubiquitin {{found in the}} prokaryote Mycobacterium tuberculosis. [...] It serves the same function as ubiquitin, although the enzymology of <b>ubiquitylation</b> and pupylation is different. In contrast to the three-step reaction of <b>ubiquitylation,</b> pupylation requires two steps, therefore only two enzymes are involved in pupylation. Similar to ubiquitin, Pup attaches to specific lysine residues of substrate proteins by forming isopeptide bonds. It is then recognized by Mycobacterium proteasomal ATPase (Mpa) by a binding-induced folding mechanism that forms a unique alpha-helix. Mpa then delivers the Pup-substrate to the 20S proteasome by coupling of ATP hydrolysis for proteasomal degradation.|$|E

5000|$|USP7 or HAUSP is a {{ubiquitin}} specific protease or a deubiquitylating {{enzyme that}} cleaves ubiquitin from its substrates.

50|$|IKK/NF-κB Transcription Factor Pathway: CD79 {{and other}} proteins, microsignalosomes, go to {{activate}} PLC-γ after antigen recognition by the BCR and {{before it goes}} to associate into the c-SMAC. It then cleaves PIP2 into IP3 and DAG (diacylglycerol). IP3 acts as a second messenger to dramatically increase ionic calcium inside the cytosol (via release from the endoplasmic reticulum or influx from the extracellular environment via ion channels). This leads to eventual activation of PKCβ from the calcium and DAG. PKCβ phosphorylates (either directly or indirectly) the NF-κB signaling complex protein CARMA1 (the complex itself comprising CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1). These result in recruitment and summoning of the IKK (IkB kinase), TAK1, by several <b>ubiquitylation</b> enzymes also associated with the CARMA1/BCL10/MALT1 complex. MALT1 itself is a caspase-like protein that cleaves A20, an inhibitory protein of NF-κB signaling (which acts by deubiquitylating NF-κB’s <b>ubiquitylation</b> substrates, having an inhibitory effect). TAK1 phosphorylates the IKK trimer after it too has been recruited to the signaling complex by its associated <b>ubiquitylation</b> enzymes. IKK then phosphorylates IkB (an inhibitor of and bound to NF-κB), which induces its destruction by marking it for proteolytic degradation, freeing cytosolic NF-κB. NF-κB then migrates to the nucleus to bind to DNA at specific response elements, causing recruitment of transcription molecules and beginning the transcription process.|$|E

50|$|The <b>ubiquitylation</b> {{reaction}} proceeds {{in three}} or four steps depending on the mechanism of action of the E3 ubiquitin ligase. In the conserved first step, an E1 cysteine residue attacks the ATP-activated C-terminal glycine on ubiquitin, resulting in a thioester Ub-S-E1 complex. The energy from ATP and diphosphate hydrolysis drives the formation of this reactive thioester, and subsequent steps are thermoneutral. Next, a transthiolation reaction occurs, in which an E2 cysteine residue attacks and replaces the E1. HECT domain type E3 ligases will have one more transthiolation reaction to transfer the ubiquitin molecule onto the E3, whereas the much more common RING finger domain type ligases transfer ubiquitin directly from E2 to the substrate. The final step in the first <b>ubiquitylation</b> event is an attack from the target protein lysine amine group, which will remove the cysteine, and form a stable isopeptide bond. One notable exception to this is p21 protein, which appears to be ubiquitylated using its N-terminal amine, thus forming a peptide bond with ubiquitin.|$|E

The scientific community has long assumed that Hsp70 and Hsc70 have similar cellular roles, but this assumption proved incomplete. While Hsc70 also performed chaperone functions under normal conditions, unlike canonical heat shock proteins, Hsc70 is constitutively expressed and performs functions related to normal cellular processes, such as protein <b>ubiquitylation</b> and degradation.|$|E
50|$|In {{unstressed}} cells, p53 {{levels are}} kept low through a continuous degradation of p53. A protein called Mdm2 (also called HDM2 in humans), binds to p53, preventing its action and transports {{it from the}} nucleus to the cytosol. Also Mdm2 acts as ubiquitin ligase and covalently attaches ubiquitin to p53 and thus marks p53 for degradation by the proteasome. However, <b>ubiquitylation</b> of p53 is reversible.|$|E

5000|$|As {{reviewed}} by Brown et al., the best-characterized activated-NEDD8 substrates are the cullins (CUL1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 5, and 7 and PARC in human cells), {{that serve as}} molecular scaffolds for cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). Neddylation results in covalent conjugation of a NEDD8 moiety onto a conserved cullin lysine residue. [...] Cullin neddylation increases CRL <b>ubiquitylation</b> activity via conformational changes that optimize ubiquitin transfer to target proteins ...|$|E
50|$|ARF is {{a highly}} basic (pI>12) and {{hydrophobic}} protein. Its basic nature is attributed to its arginine content; more than 20% of its amino acids are arginine, and it contains little or no lysine. Due to these characteristics, ARF {{is likely to be}} unstructured unless it is bound to other targets. It reportedly complexes with more than 25 proteins, although the significance of each of these interactions is not known. One of these interactions results in sumoylating activity, suggesting that ARF may modify proteins to which it binds. The SUMO protein is a small ubiquitin-like modifier, which is added to lysly ε-amino groups. This process involves a three-enzyme cascade similar to the way <b>ubiquitylation</b> occurs. E1 is an activating enzyme, E2 is a conjugation enzyme, and E3 is a ligase. ARF associates with UBC9, the only SUMO E2 known, suggesting ARF facilitates SUMO conjugation. The importance of this role is unknown, as sumoylation is involved in different functions, such as protein trafficking, <b>ubiquitylation</b> interference, and gene expression changes.|$|E
50|$|The CHIP protein encoded by {{this gene}} binds to and {{inhibits}} the ATPase {{activity of the}} chaperone proteins HSC70 and HSP70 and blocks the forward reaction of the HSC70-HSP70 substrate-binding cycle. In addition, CHIP possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and promotes <b>ubiquitylation.</b> CHIP enhances HSP70 induction during acute stress and also mediates its turnover during the stress recovery process. Hence CHIP appears to maintain protein homeostasis by controlling chaperone levels during stress and recovery.|$|E
5000|$|HAUSP is most {{popularly known}} as a direct {{antagonist}} of Mdm2, the E3 ubiquitin ligase for the tumor suppressor protein, p53. [...] Normally, p53 levels are kept low {{in part due to}} Mdm2-mediated <b>ubiquitylation</b> and degradation of p53. In response to oncogenic insults, HAUSP can deubiquitinate p53 and protect p53 from Mdm2-mediated degradation, indicating that it may possess a tumor suppressor function for the immediate stabilization of p53 in response to stress.|$|E

He became Professor of Signal Transduction at the University of Dundee in 2003 and Director of the MRC Protein Phosphorylation and <b>Ubiquitylation</b> Unit (MRC PPU) in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Many APC {{substrates}} contain both D and KEN boxes, {{with their}} <b>ubiquitylation</b> by either APC/CCdc20 or APC/CCdh1 dependent on both sequences, yet some substrates contain only either a D box or a KEN box, {{in one or}} multiple copies. Having two distinct degradation sequences creates {{a high level of}} substrate specificity on the APC/C, with APC/CCdc20 being more dependent on the D box and APC/CCdh1 more dependent on the KEN box. For example, APC/CCdh1 is capable of ubiquitylating KEN box-only-containing substrates like Tome-1 and Sororin.|$|E
50|$|The {{diversity}} of polyubiquitin-C means that <b>ubiquitylation</b> {{contributes to the}} regulation of many cellular events. Polyubiquitin-C doesn’t activate the heat-shock response, but it {{plays a key role}} in sustaining the response. UBC gene transcription is induced during stress and provides extra ubiquitin necessary to remove damaged/unfolded proteins. Polyubiquitin-C has important role in diverse biological processes, such as innate immunity, DNA repair and kinase activity. Unanchored polyubiquitin-C are also key signaling molecules that connect and coordinate the proteasome and autophagy to eliminate toxic protein aggregates.|$|E
50|$|Levels and {{stability}} of Mdm2 are also modulated by <b>ubiquitylation.</b> Mdm2 auto ubiquitylates itself, which allows for its degradation by the proteasome. Mdm2 also interacts with a ubiquitin specific protease, USP7, which can reverse Mdm2-ubiquitylation and prevent it from being degraded by the proteasome. It {{is interesting to note}} that USP7 also protects from degradation the p53 protein, which is a major target of Mdm2. Thus Mdm2 and USP7 form an intricate circuit to finely regulate the stability and activity of p53, whose levels are critical for its function.|$|E

Besides, PYR-41 inhibits degradation of p53, a tumour suppressor and also activates the transcription activity of it. PYR-41 and related pyrazones selectively kill transformed p53 expressing cells, suggesting that E1 inhibitors may be potential therapeutics in cancer.|$|E
50|$|Because of the PINK1 {{mediated}} recruitment to the mitochondrial surface, Parkin can ubiquitylate {{proteins in}} the outer mitochondrial membrane. Some of these proteins include Mfn1/Mfn2 and mitoNEET. The <b>ubiquitylation</b> of mitochondrial surface proteins brings in mitophagy initiating factors. Parkin promotes ubiquitin chain linkages on both K63 and K48. K48 ubiquitination initiates degradation of the proteins, and could allow for passive mitochondrial degradation. K63 ubiquitination is thought to recruit autophagy adaptors LC3/GABARAP which will then lead to mitophagy. It is still unclear which proteins are necessary and sufficient for mitophagy, and how these proteins, once ubiquitylated, initiate mitophagy.|$|E

50|$|In {{the absence}} of GA, many DELLAs are present to repress GA responses, but the {{formation}} of the GA-GID1-DELLA complex increases the degradation of DELLAs. The SCF complex is composed of SKP1, CULLIN, and F-BOX proteins. F-box proteins catalyze the formation of polyubiquitin on target proteins to be degraded by the 26S proteasome. The formation of the GA-GID1-DELLA complex is believed to cause a conformational change in DELLA, which enhances recognition of DELLAs by F-box proteins. Next, the SCF complex promotes <b>ubiquitylation</b> of DELLAs, which are then degraded by the 26S proteasome. Degradation of DELLAs allows GA regulated growth to resume. Thus, GA stimulates growth by activating the degradation of DELLAs.|$|E
5000|$|TKIs operate by four {{different}} mechanisms: they {{can compete with}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the phosphorylating entity, the substrate or both or can act in an allosteric fashion, namely bind to a site outside the active site, affecting its activity by a conformational change. Recently TKIs {{have been shown to}} deprive tyrosine kinases of access to the Cdc37-Hsp90 molecular chaperone system on which they depend for their cellular stability, leading to their <b>ubiquitylation</b> and degradation. [...] Signal transduction therapy can in principle also apply for non-cancer proliferative diseases and for inflammatory conditions. Until now TKIs have not been developed for the treatment of such conditions.|$|E
50|$|Exitrons are {{considered}} introns, but have characteristics of both introns and exons. They originated from ancestral coding exons, but have weaker splice site signals than other introns. Exitrons {{have been found}} to be longer and have a higher GC content than intron regions and constitutive introns. However, they are of similar size to constitutive exons and their GC content is lower compared to other exons. Exitrons lack stop codons within their sequences, have synonymous substitutions, and are most commonly found in multiples of three nucleotides. Exitron sequences contain sites for numerous post-translational modifications, including sumoylation, <b>ubiquitylation,</b> S-nitrosylation, and lysine acetylation. The ability of exitron splicing (EIS) to alter protein states demonstrates the effect it can have on proteome assortment.|$|E
