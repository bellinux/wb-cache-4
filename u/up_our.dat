5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make <b>up</b> <b>our</b> minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E

25|$|Bohm {{discussed}} {{the experience of}} listening to music. He believed the feeling of movement and change that make <b>up</b> <b>our</b> experience of music derive from holding the immediate {{past and the present}} in the brain together. The musical notes from the past are transformations rather than memories. The notes that were implicate in the immediate past become explicate in the present. Bohm viewed this as consciousness emerging from the implicate order.|$|E
25|$|My beloved children, I do {{not know}} what you await to shake off the heavy yoke and {{laborious}} servitude in which the subjugation of the Spanish has placed you. I have traveled through all of the province and have inspected all of the villages and, considering carefully the usefulness the Spanish subjugation has brought to us, I have not found a single thing but painful and inexorable servitude.... The demand for tribute is not appeased by the poverty that locks <b>up</b> <b>our</b> comrades as in a jail, nor is the thirst for our blood satisfied by the continuous whippings that bite and tear our bodies to pieces.|$|E
25|$|In the evening, {{and in the}} morning, and at noonday we praise Thee, we bless Thee, we {{give thanks}} unto Thee, and we pray unto Thee, O Lord of all: Direct Thou our prayer before Thee as incense, and incline not our hearts unto words or {{thoughts}} of wickedness: but deliver us from all who seek after our souls. For unto Thee, Lord, O Lord, lift we <b>up</b> <b>our</b> eyes, and in Thee have we trusted. Put us not to shame, O our God. For unto Thee are due all glory, honour and worship, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.|$|E

25|$|They declare openly {{that their}} God hath given them {{this country of}} land, and {{that sooner or later}} they must and will have {{possession}} of our lands for inheritance; and, in fine, they have conducted themselves on many other occasions, and such a manner, that we believe it a duty we owe to ourselves, our wives, and children, to the cause of public morals, to remove them from among us, as we are not prepared to give <b>up</b> <b>our</b> pleasant places and goodly possessions to them or to receive into the bosom of our families, as fit companions for wives and daughters, the degraded and corrupted free Negroes and mulattos that are now invited to settle among us.|$|E
25|$|These studies {{point to}} the fact that even though we only attend to and process limited information, we have a vast amount of {{knowledge}} at our disposal through our highly unrestricted sensory registers. It is the selective attention, perception, and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and it is precisely these processes that make <b>up</b> <b>our</b> conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, our conscious awareness limits our experience; nevertheless, it seems as though some stimuli that are sensed by our sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into our memories for further processing. All of our fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize our experiences.|$|E
25|$|Self-assembly {{may play}} an {{important}} role here, both from the perspective of encapsulating cells and proteins, as well as creating scaffolds on the right physical scale for engineered tissue constructs and cellular ingrowth. The micromasonry is a prime technology to get cells grown in a lab to assemble into three-dimensional shapes. To break down tissue into single-cell building blocks, researchers have to dissolve the extracellular mortar that normally binds them together. But once that glue is removed, it's quite difficult to get cells to reassemble into the complex structures that make <b>up</b> <b>our</b> natural tissues. While cells aren't easily stackable, building blocks are. So the micromasonry starts with the encapsulation of living cells in polymer cubes. From there, the blocks self-assemble in any shape using templates.|$|E

25|$|Together, {{semantic}} and {{episodic memory}} make <b>up</b> <b>our</b> declarative memory. They each represent {{different parts of}} context to form a complete picture. As such, something that affects episodic memory can also affect semantic memory. For example, anterograde amnesia, from damage of the medial temporal lobe, is an impairment of declarative memory that affects both episodic and semantic memory operations. Originally, Tulving proposed that episodic and semantic memory were separate systems that competed {{with each other in}} retrieval. However, this theory was rejected when Howard and Kahana completed experiments on latent semantic analysis (LSA) that supported the opposite. Instead of an increase in semantic similarity when there was a decrease in the strength of temporal associations, the two worked together so semantic cues on retrieval were strongest when episodic cues were strong as well.|$|E
25|$|Ngugi {{makes the}} {{dichotomy}} between the villagers (the honest working class) and the elite (corruption) most {{visible in the}} speech that Nyakinyua gives before the villagers, which motivates them {{to make the trip}} to Nairobi. She says, “I think we should go. It is our turn to make things happen. There was a time when things happened the way we in Ilmorog wanted them to happen. We had power over the movement of our limbs. We made <b>up</b> <b>our</b> own words and sang them and we danced to them. But there came a time when this power was taken from us.... We must surround the city and demand back our share” (pp.115–116). However, along their way, they are unjustly detained by Kimeria the businessman, who reveals that he is colluding with the MP, and who afterwards rapes Wanja.|$|E
25|$|So, Kant argues, we are {{committed}} to two incompatible positions. From the perspective of practical reason, which is involved when we consider how to act, we have to take ourselves as free. But from the perspective of speculative reason, which is concerned with investigating the nature of the world of appearance, freedom is impossible. So we {{are committed}} to freedom on the one hand, and yet on the other hand we are also committed to a world of appearances that is run by laws of nature and has no room for freedom. We cannot give up on either. We cannot avoid taking ourselves as free when we act, and we cannot give <b>up</b> <b>our</b> picture of the world as determined by laws of nature. As Kant puts it, there is a contradiction between freedom and natural necessity. He calls this a dialectic of reason.|$|E

The remaining members of Boyzone, Keith Duffy, Michael Graham, Ronan Keating and Shane Lynch, issued a joint statement: We are completely devastated {{by the loss of}} our friend and brother, Stephen. We have shared such wonderful times together over the years and were all looking forward to sharing many more. Stephen was a beautiful person in both body and spirit. He lit <b>up</b> <b>our</b> lives and those of the many friends he had all over the world. Our love and sympathy go out to Andrew and Stephen's family. We love you and will miss you forever, 'Steo'.A post-mortem and toxicology tests took place on 13 October and this examination showed that Gately died of natural causes. He {{died as a result of}} a congenital heart defect. Toxicology also confirmed the statement by Gately's partner Cowles that he had been smoking cannabis that evening.|$|E
25|$|Ion channel {{simulations}} {{require the}} presence of large bath regions for accurate treatment of screening. There being of such bath regions make the mesh domain of Poisson equation large and leads to either {{a large number of}} grid points with fine mesh resolution or a small number of grid points with very coarse discretization. From bulk simulations a coarse mesh is sufficient for describing the baths using the P3M scheme. However, a fine resolution is required in the channel domain because of the highly charged nature of these regions and {{the presence of}} spatially varying dielectric regions. Besides the ultimate interest is to study the channel behavior in terms of ion permeability, selectivity, gating, density, etc.… In other words, it is better off to put more computational resources in the channel region, and bare minimum in the baths to reduce the overall computational cost and speed <b>up</b> <b>our</b> simulations from weeks to perhaps days instead.|$|E
