Fruit bodies change their geotropic response three times during their development, which helps ensure that the teeth ultimately point downward for optimum spore release.

When grown in culture, the fungus can be induced to produce fruit bodies under suitable conditions.|$|E
5|$|Scales, more specifically, mostly {{consist of}} hard beta keratins which are {{basically}} transparent. The colours {{of the scale}} are due to pigments in the inner layers of the skin and not due to the scale material itself. Scales are hued for all colours in this manner except for blue and green. Blue {{is caused by the}} <b>ultrastructure</b> of the scales. By itself, such a scale surface diffracts light and gives a blue hue, while, in combination with yellow from the inner skin it gives a beautiful iridescent green.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the <b>ultrastructure</b> of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E

25|$|Current {{research}} involving Lucilia cuprina {{and other}} Lucilia species range from identifying genetic variation {{between the different}} species to the <b>ultrastructure</b> of flies’ eggs.

It is used to distinguish L. cuprina eggs from other Lucilia species, such as Lucilia illustris and Lucilia sericata. This defining feature becomes relevant when determining the post-mortem interval because it will vary with each species. Other ongoing research includes bacteria and fungi associated with the insect. Numerous studies have been conducted to determine if the fly is a mechanical vector of bacteria. So far, many have been found only to be carriers and cannot transmit disease. There have also been studies on the taxonomic grouping of Lucilia based on geography. The use of RAPD (Random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis) and mitochondrial DNA sequencing has been used to investigate genetic variation within the species.|$|E

In contrast, yeast cells ingested by activated macrophages exhibited abnormal mitochondrial <b>ultrastructures</b> within 4 h of interaction. Subsequent events that occurred were the formation of several clear vacuoles per cell, disintegration of the cytoplasm, and development of empty cells with intact walls.

40|$|Our current {{studies of}} the exoskeletal {{structures}} and <b>ultrastructures</b> in Lower Devonian dalmanitid trilobites of the Prague Basin are briefly described and discussed.

Larger structures, especially the eyes, the megapores penetrating the exoskeleton, and the surface sculptures (prosopon sensu Gill 1949), are relatively well preserved and show very fine details.

Early diagenetic dolomite and associated minerals (i. e., Mn oxides) occasionally precipitated within the diatomaceous sediments characterising this formation (Gariboldi et al., 2015; Gioncada et al., 2016).

Furthermore, the existing theory that because juvenile needlefish pass through a developmental stage where the lower jaw is longer than the upper jaw (the so-called [...] "halfbeak stage") the theory that halfbeaks are paedomorphic needlefish is untenable. In fact the unequal lengths of the upper and lower jaws of halfbeaks appears to be the basal condition, with needlefish being relatively derived in comparison.|$|E
500|$|The {{placement}} of the genus Rhodotus in the order Agaricales is uncertain, and various authors have offered solutions to the taxonomic conundrum. In 1951, Agaricales specialist Rolf Singer placed Rhodotus in the Amanitaceae because of similarities between the tribes Amaniteae and Rhodoteae, such as spore color and ornamentation (modifications of the spore wall that result in surface irregularities), structure of the hyphae and trama, and chlamydospore production during culture growth.In 1953, French mycologists [...] Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi placed Rhodotus in the family Tricholomataceae—a traditional [...] "wastebasket taxon"—on the basis of spore color. In 1969, Besson argued for the {{placement of}} Rhodotus with the Entolomataceae after studying the <b>ultrastructure</b> of the spores. By 1986, Singer had revised the placement of Rhodotus in his latest edition of The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, noting that [...] "It has formerly been inserted in the family Amanitaceae but is obviously closer to tribus Pseudohiatuleae of the Tricholomataceae." [...] Tribe Pseudohiatuleae included such genera as Flammulina, Pseudohiatula, Cyptotrama, and Callistodermatium. In 1988, a proposal was made to split the Tricholomataceae into several new families, including a family, Rhodotaceae, to contain the problematic genus.|$|E

In studies conducted to characterize receptors on LAK cell membrane <b>ultrastructures,</b> we observed that LAK cells kill autologous human mono-cyte-derived macrophages (M 4). In these experiments, {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} of a healthy adult donor were cultured to generate LAK cells and autologous non-adherent M 4. Thereafter, conjugates were prepared by incubating for 3 h autologous populations of LAK cells and M 4. Examination of the conjugates by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) identified LAK cell-mediated killing of M 4.
