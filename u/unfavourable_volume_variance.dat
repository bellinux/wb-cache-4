40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{the choice of a}} numeraire for the {{calculation}} of the sales <b>volume</b> <b>variance.</b> The sales <b>volume</b> <b>variance</b> seeks to report the effect of the actual sales volume being different from the budgeted sales volume. If different numeraires are possible, then different values for the sales <b>volume</b> <b>variance</b> will exist for a given deviation between planned and actual sales levels. We observe from the explicit or implicit materials in various common cost accounting textbooks that at least three numeraires are in evidence of use. These are: sales revenue; contribution margin and full-cost margin. The objective {{of this paper is to}} compare the effects of using the different numeraires. We also discuss the interrelationship between sales <b>volume</b> <b>variances</b> and production <b>volume</b> <b>variances</b> as two of the numeraires lead to the reporting of the production <b>volume</b> <b>variance</b> while the use of the contribution margin as a numeraire leads to a situation where the production <b>volume</b> <b>variance</b> cannot exist. In order to illustrate these concepts in an accessible form we present a case study. The case study demonstrates the results that are obtained when three different managers, each using a different numeraire, report on the results of a company where sales volume has missed the budget by a substantial amount. Given the strategic importance of making realistic sales forecasts and achieving sales targets, then this issue of reporting the effect of deviations from targets is of major importance...|$|R

This architecture significantly improved performance for hard-to-distinguish classes, like approval ("You're a clever robot") versus attention ("Hey Kismet, over here").|$|R

The experimental setting allows us to estimate the direct effects but also the interaction effects of the OCR dimensions, which have been largely neglected in previous research. The impact of the OCR dimensions is evaluated against the results from a control group that did not face OCRs when making their choices. Therefore, our experiment enables us to investigate {{the extent to which the}} presence of OCRs affects customers' consideration of brand, price, and technical product attributes.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{expiration}} day of the Index futures and Options on the trading <b>volume,</b> <b>variance</b> and price of the underlying shares. The impact of derivatives trading on the underlying stock market has been widely documented in the Finance literature. In particular, {{significant differences in the}} statistical properties of asset returns (for instance, mean and variance) during expiration and non-expiration days have been advanced as an evidence for the destabilization effect (or lack there of) of derivative instruments. The earlier studies have, however, drawn their conclusions without rigorously modelling the underlying stochastic data generation process. Given that the statistical properties mentioned before are merely traits of the asset returns, this approach can lead to spurious results if analyzed in isolation of the underlying process. We propose to address this crucial shortcoming by examining the expiration day effect from a GARCH (Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroskedastic) framework. We use both daily and high frequency (5 Â min and 10 Â min) data on S&P CNX Nifty Index.

40|$|A {{recently}} proposed model {{showed how}} a clay shrinkage curve is transformed {{to the soil}} shrinkage curve at the soil clay content higher than a critical one. The objective of the present work was to generalize this model to the soil clay content lower a critical one. I investigated (i) the reference shrinkage curve, that is, one without cracks; (ii) the superficial layer of aggregates, with changed pore structure compared with the intraaggregate matrix; and (iii) soils with sufficiently low clay content where there are large pores inside the intraaggregate clay (so-called lacunar pores). The methodology is based on detail accounting for different contributions to the soil volume and water content during shrinkage. The key point is the calculation of the lacunar pore <b>volume</b> <b>variance</b> at shrinkage. The reference shrinkage curve is determined by eight physical soil parameters: (1) oven-dried specific volume; (2) maximum swelling water content; (3) mean solid density; (4) soil clay content; (5) oven-dried structural porosity; (6) the ratio of aggregate solid mass to solid mass of intraaggregate matrix; (7) the lacunar factor that characterizes {{the rate of the}} lacunar pore volume change with water content; and (8) oven-dried lacunar pore volume. The model was validated using available data. The model predicted value of the slope of the reference shrinkage curve in the basic shrinkage area is equal to unity minus the lacunar factor value, and is between unity and zero in the agreement with observations.

The variogram {{of the number of}} stones per sample usually has a high nugget due to the extreme grade variability and the global histogram of grades is discrete and extremely skew. Yet the geological information available testifies of a highly structured deposit. Offshore deposit of the Namibian coast reveal the existence of potholes of diamonds, only a few meters in diameter, yet containing possibly a high number of stones. The potholes are clustered in areas of typically a few hundred meters across. Based on data of a typical Namibian offshore deposit, a large unconditional simulation is constructed that honors the histogram and variogram of the number of stones per sample and that depicts the conceptual geological model for the deposit. This unconditional model is constructed using a doubly stochastic Neyman-Scott point process (diamonds are but points distributed in space) reflecting the most important geological features. This unconditional simulation is used as a so-called training image from which important mining information can be extracted such as a volume-variance relationship or other change-ofsupport variables.

40|$|INTRODUCTION. Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) {{is a new}} {{ventilatory}} mode {{in which}} ventilator settings are adjusted based on the electrical activity detected in the diaphragm (Eadi). This mode offers significant advantages in mechanical ventilation over standard pressure support (PS) modes, since ventilator input is determined directly from patient ventilatory demand. Therefore, {{it is expected that}} tidal volume (Vt) under NAVA would show better correlation with Eadi compared with PS, and exhibit greater variability due to the variability in the Eadi input to the ventilator. OBJECTIVES. To compare tidal volume variability in PS and NAVA ventilation modes, and its correlation with patient ventilatory demand (as characterized by maximum Eadi). METHODS. Acomparative study of patient-ventilator interaction was performed for 22 patients during standard PS with clinician determined ventilator settings; and NAVA, with NAVA gain set to ensure the same peak airway pressure as the total pressure obtained in PS. A 20 min continuous recording was performed in each ventilator mode. Respiratory rate, Vt, and Eadi were recorded. Tidal <b>volume</b> <b>variance</b> and Pearson correlation coefficient between Vt and Eadi were calculated for each patient. A periodogram was plotted for each ventilator mode and each patient, showing spectral power as a function of frequency to assess variability. RESULTS. Median, lower quartile and upper quartile values for Vt variance and Vt/Eadi correlation are shown in Table 1. The NAVA cohort exhibits substantially greater correlation and variance than the PS cohort. Power spectrums for Vt and Eadi are shown in Fig. 1 (PS and NAVA) for a typical patient. The enlarged section highlights how changes in Eadi are highly synchronized with NAVA ventilation, but less so for PS. CONCLUSIONS. There is greater variability in tidal volume and correlation between tidal volume and diaphragmatic electrical activity with NAVA compared to PS. These results are consistent with the improved patient-ventilator synchrony reported in the literature...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study is to study the concurrent validity of the HarP toward local protocols, and its major sources of variance. Methods: Fourteen tracers segmented 10 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cases scanned at 1. 5 T and 3 T following local protocols, qualified for segmentation based on the HarP through a standard web-platform and resegmented following the HarP. The five most accurate tracers followed the HarP to segment 15 ADNI cases acquired at three time points on both 1. 5 T and 3 T. Results: The agreement among tracers was relatively low with the local protocols (absolute left/right ICC 0. 44 / 0. 43) and much higher with the HarP (absolute left/right ICC 0. 88 / 0. 89). On the larger set of 15 cases, the HarP agreement within (left/right ICC range: 0. 94 / 0. 95 to 0. 99 / 0. 99) and among tracers (left/right ICC range: 0. 89 / 0. 90) was very high.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the Arctic region for global climate change has recently been highlighted in the results from general circulation model simulations under increasing atmospheric CO 2 scenarios. The warming that is predicted by these studies is most pronounced in the polar regions, indicating {{that it may be}} the first place in which the effects of global climate change will be detected. However, the natural variability that is present in the Arctic climate system is largely unknown and is likely to obscure the detection of anthropogenically forced changes. Additionally, there is little information on the internal processes of the Arctic ice pack, which are important for determining the variability of the ice cover. In an effort to address these issues, the variability of the Arctic ice volume is examined using a single column sea ice–ocean mixed layer model. The model contains an ice thickness distribution and the parameterization of export and ridging due to ice divergence and shear. Variability in the ice cover is forced by applying stochastic perturbations to the air temperature and ice divergence forcing fields. Several sensitivity tests are performed in order to assess the role of different physical processes in determining the variability of the perennial Arctic ice pack. It is found that the surface albedo and ice–ocean feedback mechanisms act to enhance the variability of the ice volume and are particularly important for the simulated response of the sea ice to fluctuations in air temperature, accounting for approximately 62 % and 25 % of the ice <b>volume</b> <b>variance,</b> respectively. The details of the ice thickness distribution also significantly affect the simulated variability. In particular, the ridging process acts to decrease the simulated variability of the ice pack.

Most previous work assumed that a worm always propagates itself at the highest possible speed. Some newly developed worms (e. g., “Atak ” worm) contradict this assumption by deliberately reducing the propagation speed in order to avoid detection. As such, we study a new class of worms, referred to as self-disciplinary worms. These worms adapt their propa-gation patterns {{in order to reduce the}} probability of detection, and to eventually infect more computers.

To develop proper countermeasures, we introduce a game-theoretic formulation to model the interaction between the worm propagator and the defender.

Endothermic species, e. g. dinosaurs that covered their eggs with soil, restricted the free circulation of air and would have been first to become extinct. Smaller ectothermic species, e. g. crocodiles, chelonians and saurians with lower embryonic respiratory requirements and endothermic species like the birds that did not cover their eggs, survived.
