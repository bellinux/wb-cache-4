5|$|Characteristics often vary by habitat, between shade-dwelling genera (such as Prosartes, Tricyrtis, Cardiocrinum, Clintonia, Medeola, Prosartes, and Scoliopus) and sun loving genera. Shade-dwelling genera <b>usually</b> <b>have</b> broader {{leaves with}} smooth edges and net venation, and fleshy fruits (berries) with animal-dispersed seeds, rhizomes, and small, {{inconspicuous}} flowers while genera native to sunny habitats <b>usually</b> <b>have</b> narrow, parallel-veined leaves, capsular fruits with wind-dispersed seeds, bulbs, and large, visually conspicuous flowers.

25|$|Chainrings {{designed}} for use with multi-chainring crank arms may have ramps or pins to aid in shifting.

The smallest chainring <b>usually</b> <b>has</b> the least, if any shaping.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were many}} visible {{differences}} between the inmates of the Hospital General and the paupers who received bread. The most obvious is that most recipients of bread were in their prime years of age, unlike the majority percentage of elderly in the Hospital. The inmates in the hospital <b>usually</b> <b>had</b> illnesses consisting of birth defects or [...] "mysterious humors". Meanwhile, the recipients of bread <b>usually</b> <b>had</b> illnesses or injuries related to their places of labor. Men <b>usually</b> <b>had</b> ambulations or broken limbs, while women commonly had bad eyesight and lung disease.|$|R

5|$|Sebrights {{are neither}} {{prolific}} egg layers, nor outstanding meat birds. They can {{prove to be}} particularly difficult to raise, especially for beginners.

5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would <b>usually</b> <b>have</b> to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
5|$|Although women {{faced with}} double burden <b>usually</b> <b>have</b> more stress than most women in today's society, it was proven {{that in most}} cases they are psychologically {{healthier}} than women who are not faced with these circumstances, for either being a stay at home mother or for being a working woman without children to take care of.|$|E
5|$|Archaea <b>usually</b> <b>have</b> {{a single}} {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many}} as 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaeal genome. The tiny 490,885base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation.|$|E
