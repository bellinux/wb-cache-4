40|$|Women with {{nocturia}} {{are more}} sensitive to desmopressin, a synthetic arginine vasopressin (AVP) analogue, with significant antidiuretic responses to desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) 25 μg, compared with men who require 58 μg to achieve si milar responses. In children the current desmopres sin dose recommendation to treat primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) {{is the same for}} boys and girls. This post hoc analysis of data from a randomised, doubleblind single-dose study of 84 children with PNE aged 6 - 12 years explored gender differences in sensitivity to desmopressin in children. Following water loading to suppress endogenous AVP, placebo or desmopres-sin 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 or 480 μg was administered when urinary production reached > 0. 13 mL/min/kg. The endpoints of <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> and duration of urinary-concentrating action (DOA) (above three thresholds: 125, 200 and 400 mOsm/kg) were analysed to compare efficacy in boys and girls, in each treatment group. The DOA and <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> were similar in both genders in the desmopressin 120 - 480 μg groups. Boys receiving desmopressin ODT 30 - 60 μg tended to increased <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> and experienced 1 - 2 hours longer DOA than girls. The same pattern of higher values in boys compared with girls was seen for all measures of <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality.</b> Conclusion : In a limited sample of pre-pubertal children the antidiuretic response to desmopressin was largely similar between genders, in contrast to findings in adults. </p...|$|E

40|$|Uppsala—The {{diuretic}} {{effects of}} benzisothiazolinone (BIT), vapours from a water-based paint, and the reference compound furosemide, were investigated in an experimental model employing anaesthetised rats.

The paint vapours and furosemide were administered during anaesthesia. <b>Urinary</b> flow, <b>osmolality,</b> <b>urinary</b> concentrations of sodium and potassium, {{and blood pressure}} were measured as indicators of renal function. Whereas all these parameters were significantly affected after an injection with furosemide, neither BIT nor the vapours from the paint were found to induce any biologically significant effects.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Increased {{mortality}} {{with severe}} hyponatraemia is well known. What {{is less clear}} is the mortality risk according to {{the pattern of the}} developing hyponatraemia and whether this may be affected by the intervention of the clinician. METHODS: From our laboratory database, we retrospectively collected data of a 12 -month period of adult patients with severe hyponatraemia (or = 130 mmol/l. Results are mean +/- SD unless stated otherwise. Duration of hospitalisation and clinical outcomes was confirmed from hospital records. RESULTS: The mean nadir plasma sodium of the hyponatraemic group was 116. 0 +/- 4. 4 mmol/l and 134. 0 +/- 2. 8 mmol/l in controls. Although the hyponatraemic patients were younger than controls (65. 8 +/- 18. 4 vs. 72. 3 +/- 14. 9 years; p = 0. 004), they had higher mortality (24 vs. 7, p = 0. 002) and longer hospitalisation than controls: median (IQR), 12 (7 - 22) vs. 7 (3 - 16. 5) days (p < 0. 001). A total of 55 patients developed severe hyponatraemia following admission. This subgroup comprised a higher proportion of surgical patients (23. 6 % vs. 1. 7 %, p < 0. 001) than those with severe hyponatraemia on admission. Furthermore, both mortality (n = 17 vs. n = 7; p = 0. 02) and duration of hospitalisation, median 19 days (IQR 10 - 35) vs. 9. 5 (5 - 15) days (p < 0. 001), were greater. Failure to measure plasma and <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolalities</b> was associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Severe hyponatraemia is associated with prolonged admission and increased mortality compared with normonatraemic patients. Progressive hyponatraemia following admission incurs a higher risk of death. This may represent illness-severity, inappropriate management or inadequate investigation...|$|R

40|$|The {{association}} of potassium (K) depletion with polyuria and a concentrating defect is established, but {{the extent to}} which these defects could be secondary to an effect of low K on water intake has not been systematically investigated. To determine whether hypokalemia has a primary effect to increase thirst and whether any resultant polyuria and polydipsia contribute to the concentrating defect, we studied three groups of rats kept in metabolic cages for 15 days. The groups were set up as follows: group 1, normal diets and ad lib. fluids (n = 12); group 2, K-deficient diet on ad lib. fluids (n = 12); and group 3, K-deficient diet and fluid intake matched to group 1 (n = 14). Daily urine flow and <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> of groups 1 and 3 were not significantly different throughout the study. In contrast, as of day 6, group 2 rats consistently had a higher fluid intake (P < 0. 0025), higher urine flow (P < 0. 001), and lower <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> (P < 0. 001) than the other two groups. These alterations in fluid intake and urine flow preceded a defect in maximal concentrating ability. On day 7, maximal <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> was 2, 599 ± 138 msmol/kg in rats on K-deficient intake and 2, 567 ± 142 msmol/kg in controls. To determine whether this primary polydipsia is itself responsible for the development of the concentrating defect, the three groups of rats were dehydrated on day 15. Despite different levels of fluid intake, maximal <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> was impaired equally in groups 2 and 3 (1, 703 and 1, 511 msmol/kg, respectively), as compared to rats in group 1 (2, 414 msmol/kg), P < 0. 001. We therefore conclude that K depletion stimulates thirst, and the resultant increase in water intake is largely responsible for the observed polyuria. After 15 days of a K-deficient diet, the impaired maximal urinary concentration in hypokalemia, however, was not related to increased water intake, since fluid restriction did not abolish the renal concentrating defect...|$|E

Our study investigated a possible {{effect of the}} glycolipoprotein, (GLPc) extracted from L. interrogans, on vasopressin (Vp) action in the guinea pig inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD). METHODS: The osmotic water permeability (Pf µm/s) {{was measured by the}} microperfusion in vitro technique. AQP 2 protein abundance was determined by Western Blot. Three groups were established for study as follows: Group I, IMCD from normal (ngp, n =  5) and from leptospirotic guinea-pigs (lgp-infected with L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni, GLPc, n =  5); Group II, IMCD from normal guinea-pigs in the presence of GLPc (GLPc group, n =  54); Group III, IMCD from injected animals with GLPc ip (n =  8). RESULTS: In Group I, PFS were: ngp [...] 61. 8 ± 22. 1 and lgp [...] 8. 8 ± 12. 4, p< 0. 01 and the <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolalities</b> were: lgp [...] 735 ± 64 mOsm/Kg and ngp [...] 1, 632 ± 120 mOsm/Kg. The lgp BUN was higher (176 ± 36 mg%) than the ngp (56 ± 9 mg%). In Group II, the Pf was measured under GLPc (250 µg/ml) applied directly to the bath solution of the microperfused normal guinea-pig IMCDs. GLPc blocked Vp (200 pg/ml, n =  5) action, did not block cAMP (10 (- 4) M), and Forskolin (Fors [...] 10 (- 9) M) action, but partially blocked Cholera Toxin (ChT [...] 10 (- 9) M) action. GLP from L. biflexa serovar patoc (GLPp, non pathogenic, 250 µg) did not alter Vp action. In Group III, GLPc (250 µg) injected intraperitoneally produced a decrease of about 20 % in IMCD Aquaporin 2 expression. CONCLUSION: The IMCD Pf decrease caused by GLP is evidence, at least in part, towards explaining the urinary concentrating incapacity observed in infected guinea-pigs...|$|R

When provided free access to water, PKC-alpha -/- mice showed approximately 50 % greater urine flow rate and lower <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> in 24 -h metabolic cage experiments despite a greater urinary vasopressin-to-creatinine ratio vs. PKC-alpha +/+ mice. Renal albumin excretion was not different. Clearance experiments under inactin/ketamine anesthesia revealed a modestly reduced glomerular filtration rate and showed a reduced absolute and fractional renal fluid reabsorption in PKC-alpha -/- mice. The sodium-restricting response to a low-sodium diet was unaffected in PKC-alpha -/- mice. <b>Urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> was reduced to similar hypotonic levels in PKC-alpha -/- and +/+ mice during acute oral water loading or application of the vasopressin V(2) -receptor antagonist SR- 121463.

In seven experiments the intravenous administration of PGE 1 (7 μg/min) significantly increased <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> from 76 to 381 mosmol (P < 0. 001) and decreased free water clearance from 2. 2 to - 0. 02 ml/min (P < 0. 001). These effects promptly were reversed with cessation of the infusion. This antidiuretic effect occurred both in innervated and denervated kidneys and {{was not associated with}} changes in glomerular filtration rate, renal vascular resistance, or solute excretion rate. In 10 experiments in hypophysectomized dogs no effect of intravenous PGE 1 on free water clearance and <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> was observed. The intrarenal administration of PGE 1 (1 μg/min) to six water-loaded and two hypophysectomized dogs caused no systemic vascular changes and increased rather than decreased free water clearance (2. 83 to 4. 08 ml/min, P < 0. 001). No significant change in <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> occurred. Glomerular filtration rate was not altered by the intrarenal infusion, but reversible changes in solute excretion rate and renal vascular resistance occurred. These results thus indicate that the antidiuresis associated with intravenous PGE 1 is mediated primarily by the release of vasopressin rather than alterations in renal hemodynamics or solute excretion. The diuretic effect of intrarenal PGE 1 occurs in the absence of vasopressin and is most likely mediated primarily by increased distal delivery of tubular fluid to the diluting segment of the nephron rather than changes in water permeability of the renal tubular epithelium...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the pharmacodynamic properties {{of a new}} oral lyophilisate formulation of desmopressin (in single doses of 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 or 480 microg) in children with known primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) and thus identify those dosages that could provide a duration of action corresponding to a typical length of night-time sleep in children with PNE; additional objectives were to {{determine the}} safety and tolerability of desmopressin in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with PNE (mean three or more wet nights/week), aged 6 - 12 years, were randomized into a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. An overhydration technique was used before dosing to suppress endogenous vasopressin production and thereby ensure that any antidiuresis {{could be attributed to}} treatment. Dosing with desmopressin or placebo occurred when urinary production was > 0. 13 mL/min/kg. <b>Urinary</b> volume, <b>osmolality</b> and duration of urinary-concentrating action (above three threshold levels: 125, 200 and 400 mOsm/kg) were determined as endpoints. RESULTS: All 72 participants receiving desmopressin had a pharmacodynamic response to the drug, while there was no change in urinary output in the 12 placebo-treated patients. There was a clear relationship between desmopressin dose and duration of action and osmolality during action, although the three highest-dose groups had similar results. The mean duration of action of desmopressin at the lowest osmolality threshold level was 3. 6 - 10. 6 h, according to dose; for the highest threshold, the values were 1. 3 - 8. 6 h. CONCLUSION: Desmopressin, as the oral lyophilisate, causes a marked decrease in urinary output in hydrated children with PNE. A small dose range (120 - 240 microg) is likely to control diuresis for a period corresponding to a night's sleep (7 - 11 h) in most children with PNE.

Fluids are represented by water with two solutes, urea and ‘electrolytes’. Methods are described for obtaining steady state values of interstitial concentrations and tubular fluid flow rates and concentrations, for any given set of membrane permeabilities and transport properties. The following set of permeabilities is used to model an antidiuretic kidney: water permeability moderate in descending limb of Henle, low in ascending limb, high in distal tubule and collecting duct; urea permeability high in descending and thin ascending limbs of Henle, low in thick ascending limb, distal tubule and cortical collecting duct, and moderate in medullary collecting duct; electrolyte permeability high in descending limb of Henle; active electrolyte reabsorption limited by a concentration gradient of 200 mOsm/kg H 2 O in the entire ascending limb of Henle; fixed absolute and relative electrolyte reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct; high passive permeabilities to water, urea, and electrolytes in descending and ascending vasa recta.

This diuretic effect occurred in both innervated and denervated kidneys and was not associated with an increase in glomerular filtration rate or solute excretion. Systemic arterial pressure increased from 121 to 142 mm Hg during the norepinephrine infusion.

40|$|A 20 {{years old}} woman, {{admitted}} in our Centre at the 6 th week of pregnancy, {{was affected by}} Central Diabetes Insipidus and {{since the age of}} 10 years old she assumed desmopressin at a dose of 30 mg/nostril/day. She was primigravida, with normal past medical history. Fasting blood levels were normal; specific gravity of the urine: 1006; no glucosuria or proteinuria was present. <b>Urinary</b> and plasma <b>osmolality</b> were 245 and 287 mOsm/l; water intake about 2700 mL/day; diuresis 2000 mL/day. On the basis of the value of urine output and osmolality the dose of desmopressin was increased at 40 mg/nostril/day. Patient was evaluated every month with fluid balance, urine volume, osmolality, and serum elec-trolytes. Daily dosage of desmopressin was 40 mg/nostril for all the duration of pregnancy according to a trend of an adequate fluid and electrolytes balance and in absence of symptoms. Mean blood Pressure was 100 / 60 mmHg; coagu-lation, liver, renal function were normal. Fetal monitoring with periodic ultrasound detected a normal intrauterine growth. Patient had an uncomplicated labor of a healthy male baby at the 39 th week. Because of an insufficient dilata-tion of the cervical canal caesarian section was chosen. Despite a previous Central Diabetes Insipidus may worsen in a pregnant with impaired reserve of Antidiuretic Hormone because of the changes in osmoregulatory system and in-creased levels of vasopressinasis in middle and late pregnancy, our patient required a slightly higher dose of desmo-pressin in the first trimester.

40|$|Background/Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} neonatal handling on hydroelectrolytic balance in adult rats. Methods: The litters {{were divided into two}} groups: nonhandled and handled. The procedure consisted of handling the pups for 1 min/day in the first 10 days postnatally. When adults, animals had their body weight verified and were housed in individual metabolic cages. After a 24 -hour period, urine samples were collected and the urinary and water intake volumes measured. Blood samples to determine osmolality, aldosterone, corticosterone, angiotensin II, creatinine, urea, sodium and potassium levels were collected. The kidneys were removed for histological assessment. <b>Urinary</b> <b>osmolality,</b> sodium, urea and creatinine were also measured and the creatinine clearance (CC) calculated. Results: No difference between groups was found in the body weight. Handled animals showed a reduction in the total kidney wet weight, water intake, urinary volume, CC, plasma angiotensin II, corticosterone and aldosterone when compared to the nonhandled and an increase in the <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> and sodium excretion fraction. No differences in serum potassium and no evidence of structural changes were demonstrated by histological analysis. Conclusion: Neonatal handling induced long-lasting effects decreasing renal function without evidence of kidney structural changes. Copyright (c) 2009 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of exercise on urine sediment in adolescent soccer players. In 25 15 -year-old (range 14. 4 - 15. 8 yrs) athletes, urinary protein, osmolality and cytology were analyzed by flow cytometry and automated dipstick analysis before (T- 0), during (T- 1), and after a match (T- 2). All athletes had normal urine analysis and blood pressure at rest, tested {{before the start of}} the soccer season. Fifty-eight samples were collected (T- 0 : 20, T- 1 : 17, T- 2 : 21). Proteinuria was present in 20 of 38 samples collected after exercise. Proteinuria was associated with increased <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> (p <. 001) and specific gravity (p <. 001). Hyaline and granular casts were present in respectively 8 of 38 and 8 of 38 of the urinary samples after exercise. The presence of casts was associated with urine protein concentration, osmolality, and specific gravity. This was also the case for hematuria (25 of 38) and leucocyturia (9 of 38). Squamous epithelial cells were excreted in equal amounts to white and red blood cells. A notable proportion of adolescent athletes developed sediment abnormalities, which were associated with <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> and specific gravity...|$|E
40|$|Plasma renin {{activity}} was determined in 25 healthy, full-term, newborn infants aged 1 day to 9 weeks. High values were found, the mean level at 1 - 2 days of life (24. 8 +/- 8. 4 ng/ml/hr, SE) being {{significantly higher than}} the mean levels at 7 - 9 days (5. 8 +/- 1. 5) and at 4 - 9 weeks (8. 1 +/- 1. 3) (P less than 0. 05). No correlation was found between plasma renin activity and systolic blood pressure, hematocrit, creatinine clearance, serum sodium, or serum potassium. Plasma renin activity (log values) was inversely correlated with sodium intake (r = - 0. 58) or with urinary sodium (r = - 0. 44), and positively with <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality</b> (r = 0. 67). The correlations reached higher coefficients if only infants aged {{less than or equal to}} 9 days were considered. In addition, vasopressin was measured by radioimmunoassay in the urine. The daily excretion was lower in newborn infants (9. 4 +/- 1. 6 ng/m 2 /day, SE, at 1 - 2 days of postnatal life) than in healthy children (37. 1 +/- 5. 6), and was significantly correlated with creatinine clearance (r = 0. 69), but not with <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolality...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} kidney dysfunction and haplotypes in sickle cell disease. Methods: A cohort of 84 sickle cell disease patients, treated in a public health service in Fortaleza, Brazil, was studied. Hemoglobin S haplotypes were obtained from 57 patients as they had recently received blood transfusions with 18 of them agreeing to undertake urinary concentrating ability and acidification tests. The glomerular filtration rate was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. Urinary concentration was evaluated utilizing the <b>urinary</b> and serum <b>osmolality</b> ratio (U/Posm) after 12 hours of water deprivation. Urinary acidification was evaluated by measuring the urinary pH {{before and after the}} administration of oral CaCl 2. The analysis of the haplotypes of the beta S gene cluster was carried out by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used for multiple comparisons of means and the Newman-Keuls test was used to identify which groups were significantly different. Results: The mean age of the patients was 33 &# 177; 13 years with 64. 2 % being females. The glomerular filtration rate was normal in 25 cases (30 %) and a rate > 120 mL/min was seen in 52 cases (62 %). Urinary concentration deficit was found in all patients who underwent the test and urinary acidification in 22 %. There was no significant difference when comparing patients with the Bantu/Bantu and Benin/Benin haplotypes. On comparing patients with the Central African Republic-haplotype however, a higher number had glomerular filtration rates between 60 and 120 mL/min. Conclusion: There was no significant difference among sickle cell disease patients regarding the haplotypes and kidney dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Hyponatraemia is {{the most}} common {{electrolyte}} abnormality following subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. Retrospective data suggests that the syndrome of inappropriate diuresis (SIAD) {{is the most}} common cause of hyponatraemia in SAH, though cerebral salt wasting has been postulated by some workers to be the predominant abnormality. Data which has shown acute glucocorticoid deficiency following SAH has suggested that some cases of euvolaemic hyponatraemia may also be caused by this mechanism. We prospectively studied the hormonal and haemodynamic influences involved in the development of hyponatraemia in 100 patients (61 % female, median age 53 (range 16 - 82)) with non-traumatic aneurysmal SAH. Each patient had plasma sodium (pNa), urea, osmolality, glucose and 0900 h cortisol (PC), and <b>urinary</b> sodium and <b>osmolality</b> measured on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 following SAH. Fluid balance and haemodynamic parameters were recorded daily. Results were compared with 15 patients admitted to ITU following vascular surgery. A PC 500 nmol/L on day 1, and > 300 nmol on days 3 – 12. There were no cases of cerebral salt wasting. There was no relationship between the incidence of hyponatraemia and the defined anatomical territory or severity of SAH. There was no difference in the incidence of hyponatraemia between those patients who had an intervention and those who did not (p= 0. 11), or in the incidence of hyponatraemia between those patients who had clipping and those who had coiling. In the first prospective study of its kind, hyponatraemia occurs in over half of aneurysmal SAH cases, predominantly due to SIAD. Acute glucocorticoid deficiency is a treatable cause of a minority of cases of hyponatraemia. We found no evidence of cerebral salt wasting...|$|R
40|$|The {{safety and}} {{diuretic}} activity of torasemide (1 -isopropyl- 3 - ([4 -(3 -methyl-phenylamino) pyridine]- 3 -sulfonyl) urea) were investigated in a phase I single-blind clinical study. After a pretreatment control day on placebo, a single dose of torasemide was administered orally {{according to an}} escalating dosage of 2. 5, 5, 10 and 20 mg, respectively, in 4 groups of 3 healthy young male volunteers, after an overnight fast and 1 h before breakfast. The peak stimulatory effect on urinary volume was observed within 1 to 2 h and {{was followed by a}} gradual decline at the 3 rd or 4 th h back to or even slightly below the corresponding control values. Thus, the duration of action averaged 3 - 4 h and only moderate rebound effects were detected. This time-related diuretic activity perfectly fitted with the pharmacokinetics data since torasemide plasma levels peaked at the 1 st h after drug administration and thereafter rapidly fell to less than 10 % of the maximal plasma concentrations after the 4 th h. While 2. 5 mg torasemide showed only minor diuretic action, urinary volume and urinary excretion of sodium, chloride and calcium increased linearly with the logarithm of the dose during the first 4 h as well as during the whole 24 h period with 5, 10 and 20 mg torasemide. Conversely, the <b>urinary</b> density and <b>osmolality</b> fell progressively as the dose of torasemide increased. There was a trend towards a moderate decrease in urinary excretion of uric acid which seemed independent of the dose given. Finally, only minimal potassium urinary losses were observed without clear tendency towards an increase with increasing drug doses. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Peer reviewe...|$|R
