25|$|Originally, Mošovce {{was made}} up of two settlements: The first one, Machyuch, was located in the area of today’s Starý Rad, and the second one, Terra Moys, which gave the village its current name, {{occupied}} the place of the present day Vidrmoch. And it {{is the name of the}} second settlement meaning The Land of Mojš, which makes <b>us</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the whole village once belonged to certain Mr. Mojš, whose name might have been an abbreviation of a compound Slavic name Mojtech, similar to the names Vojtech or Mojmír. Throughout history the name of the village has undergone many variations ranging from Mossovych, Mosocz, Mossowecz, villa regia Mayos alio nomine Mossovych, oppidioum Mayus sue Mosocz, Mosocz olim Mayus to the present-day Mošovce.|$|E

2500|$|Ebert {{ultimately}} {{concludes that}} [...] "The movie {{is not about}} ghosts but about madness and the energies". Likewise, film critic James Berardinelli (who is generally much less impressed with the film than Ebert), notes that [...] "King would have <b>us</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the hotel is haunted. Kubrick is less definitive in the interpretations he offers." [...] He dubs the film a failure as a ghost story, but brilliant as a study of [...] "madness and the unreliable narrator." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{reference}} to the character's brief dallience with Christianity in 2008, TV critic for heat magazine, Julie Emery commented, [...] "Stop right now, EastEnders.

Anyway, we like her nasty bad-girl ways." [...] Bissix was nominated in the [...] "Best Bitch" [...] category at the Inside Soap Awards in 2008, {{for her role as}} Clare Bates.|$|E
2500|$|The December 2004 {{issue of}} Musclecar Enthusiast" [...] {{conducted}} an engine dynamometer {{test of a}} freshly rebuilt and well documented 1970 455 Stage 1 (bored [...]040" [...] over to 464 cubic inches and minus the power-robbing factory engine fan, air cleaner assembly and mufflers). In that condition and with factory timing and carburetor tuning, the engine produced a maximum of 360.9 HP. Optimal carburetor and ignition tuning yielded a peak HP reading of 381.7 HP - again with no engine fan, air cleaner or mufflers in place. While urban legend would have <b>us</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> these engines made [...] "420 HP from the factory," [...] actual empirical results prove otherwise. Although another dynamometer test on a 1970 Skylark GS Stage I showed 471 SAE gross hp, which is more consistent with the engine producing about 360 SAE net hp.|$|E
2500|$|The Stevens dissent {{seems to}} rest on four main points of disagreement: that the Founders {{would have made the}} {{individual}} right aspect of the Second Amendment express if that was what was intended; that the [...] "militia" [...] preamble and exact phrase [...] "to keep and bear arms" [...] demands the conclusion that the Second Amendment touches on state militia service only; that many lower courts' later [...] "collective-right" [...] reading of the Miller decision constitutes stare decisis, which may only be overturned at great peril; and that the Court has not considered gun-control laws (e.g., the National Firearms Act) unconstitutional. The dissent concludes, [...] "The Court would have <b>us</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> over 200 years ago, the Framers made a choice to limit the tools available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons.... I could not possibly conclude that the Framers made such a choice." ...|$|E

2500|$|This period {{also brought}} him and Crainic {{into contact with}} the radically antisemitic Iron Guard. In December 1933, Crevedia was one of the intellectuals who protested in Axa {{magazine}} against the government's decision to ban the Guard. During 1935, he was present at Maglavit, one of several Guard sympathizers claiming to have witnessed the religious miracles performed by shepherd Petrache Lupu. In Porunca Vremii, he claimed that Lupu had cured his own uncontrollable blinking. He penned panegyrics to the Guard's Captain Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, an [...] "extraordinary organizer" [...] and [...] "profound thinker who reflects on the current issues facing our nation." [...] In his words, Codreanu, an example of [...] "virility, faith, and sacrifice, [...] managed to make <b>us</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> this Nation has not disappeared." [...] He alternated this cult with that of King Carol II and his [...] "Prince Charming" [...] son, Michael I. Nonetheless, Vizirescu accused him of being a disloyal [...] "servant" [...] of Crainic and an inconsistent, corrupt, ally of the Iron Guard. Reportedly, Crevedia complained to his peers that Crainic was exploiting him.|$|E
2500|$|Edwards went on {{to define}} the two Americas he claimed to exist, one {{for the rich and}} one for the poor, and {{repeated}} several times that [...] "It doesn't have to be that way." [...] He called for one health care system, equal in quality to the coverage received by Senators and other elected officials, and promised to establish a Patients' Bill of Rights. Edwards proposed one public school system for all, arguing that [...] "None of <b>us</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the quality of a child's education should be controlled by where they live or the affluence of their community." [...] He appealed {{for the end of the}} two economies, [...] "one for people who are set for life, they know their kids and grandkids are going to be just fine, and then one for most Americans, people who live paycheck to paycheck." [...] Edwards also stated how the Democrats expected to pay for their agenda: [...] "We're going to roll back – we're going to roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. And we're going to close corporate loopholes. We're going to cut government contractors and wasteful spending. We can move this country forward without passing the burden to our children and our grandchildren." ...|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} {{a wide range of}} views on the {{relationship}} between church teachings on human origins and scientific findings. In the US where many Mormons live, a 2013 poll showed that 60% of <b>US</b> adults <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> humans evolved over time while 30% believed they had existed in their present form since the beginning.

50|$|Throughout this article, the {{importance}} of the United States and the USSR in these relations will be discussed since it had a large impact on the relations between Mexico and Cuba.

50|$|He had {{impressed}} upon Arafat {{the need}} for the Palestinian Authority to ensure public order and internal security within the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

50|$|Some {{claim that}} because Israel knew the {{schedule}} of the inspectors' visits, {{it was able}} to hide the illegal manufacture of nuclear weapons, thereby deceiving the inspectors, by installing temporary false walls and other devices before each inspection. The inspectors eventually informed the U.S. government that their inspections were useless, due to Israeli restrictions on what areas of the facility they could inspect.

60|$|The Rameau of the {{dialogue}} was a real personage, {{and there is a}} dispute whether Diderot has not calumniated him.

Juvenal's fifth satire would be worth neither more nor less, however much were found out about Trebius.|$|E
