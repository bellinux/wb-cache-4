The play was zippy black comedy about predators in twilight; {{the film is}} a photo-essay, shot in morgue closeup, about the difficulty most people have convincing themselves that what they do matters". However, Desson Howe's review in The Washington Post criticized Foley's direction, writing that it [...] "doesn't add {{much more than the}} street between.

Movie Room Reviews gave the film 4 stars and said [...] "Director James Foley does a great job of making the film seem claustrophobic, so that the audience almost feels as if it is in the fluorescent lighting of the drab office." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pay for {{performance}} programs often target patients with serious and complex illnesses; such patients commonly interact with multiple healthcare providers and facilities. However, pilot programs now underway focus on simple indicators such as improvement in lab values {{or use of}} emergency services, avoiding areas of complexity such as multiple complications or several treating specialists. A 2007 study analyzing Medicare beneficiaries' healthcare visits showed that a median of two primary care physicians and five specialists provide care for a single patient. The authors doubt that pay-for-performance systems can accurately attribute responsibility for the outcome of care for such patients. The American College of Physicians Ethics has stated concerns about using a limited set of clinical practice parameters to assess quality, [...] "especially if payment for good performance is grafted onto the current payment system, which does not reward robust comprehensive care...The elderly patient with multiple chronic conditions is especially vulnerable to this <b>unwanted</b> <b>effect</b> of powerful incentives." [...] Present pay-for-performance systems measure good performance based on specified clinical measurements, such as glycohemoglobin for diabetic patients. Healthcare providers who are monitored by such limited criteria have a powerful incentive to deselect (dismiss or refuse to accept) patients whose outcome measures fall below the quality standard and therefore worsen the provider's assessment. Patients with low health literacy, inadequate financial resources to afford expensive medications or treatments, and ethnic groups traditionally subject to healthcare inequities may also be deselected by providers seeking improved performance measures.|$|E

40|$|In 14 {{patients}} receiving chronic amiodarone therapy {{the appearance of}} multilamellar inclusion bodies in peripheral blood neutrophils was related to both plasma concentrations of amiodarone and its desethyl metabolite and <b>unwanted</b> <b>effects</b> of the drug.

Of the seven patients without inclusion bodies only one, with high plasma amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentrations, had <b>unwanted</b> <b>effects</b> of the drug.

50|$|ASE is {{produced}} when a laser gain medium is pumped {{to produce a}} population inversion. Feedback of the ASE by the laser's optical cavity may produce laser operation if the lasing threshold is reached. Excess ASE is an <b>unwanted</b> <b>effect</b> in lasers, since it is not coherent, and limits the maximum gain {{that can be achieved}} in the gain medium. ASE creates serious problems in any laser with high gain and/or large size. In this case, a mechanism to absorb or extract the incoherent ASE must be provided, otherwise the excitation of the gain medium will be depleted by the incoherent ASE rather than by the desired coherent laser radiation. ASE is especially problematic in lasers with short and wide optical cavities, such as disk lasers (active mirrors).|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{guidelines}} {{recommend that}} {{first line treatment}} of chronic spontaneous urticaria should be second generation non-sedating H 1 -antihistamines with a positive recommendation {{against the use of}} old sedating first generation antihistamines.

The objective {{of this study was to}} obtain the chronic spontaneous urticaria-patient perspective on the effectiveness and <b>unwanted</b> <b>effects</b> of H 1 -antihistamines in standard and higher doses. Methodology/Principal Findings: This was a questionnaire based survey, initially completed by 368 individuals. 319 (248 female, 71 male, median age 42 years) had a physician-confirmed diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria and were included in the results. Participants believed standard doses (manufacturers recommended dose) of second generation antihistamines to be significantly (P, 0. 005) more effective than first generation drugs. Furthermore, they believed that second generation drugs caused significantly (P, 0. 001) fewer <b>unwanted</b> <b>effects</b> and caused significantly (P, 0. 001) less sedation than first generation antihistamines. Three-quarters of the patients stated that they had up-dosed with antihistamines with 40 %, 42 % and 54 % reporting significant added benefit from taking 2, 3 or 4 tablets daily respectively.
