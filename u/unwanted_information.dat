By other bad consequences Baker means privacy violations and conduct that does not necessarily result in tangible harm, but does result in unwanted consequences. Baker argues that the privacy violations that result from being forced to receive <b>unwanted</b> obscene <b>information</b> in public places (exhibitionism) would amount to a sufficient bad consequence for the purposes of invoking the criminal law, but argues that proportionate punishment means that such conduct should only be punished with fines rather than jail terms.|$|R

Initial studies of information flow analysis were performed by abstracting away from time and probability.

In this paper we propose a general framework, based on Probabilistic Timed Automata, where both probabilistic and timing covert channels can be studied. As an application, we study a system with covert channels that we are able to discover by our techniques. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} simulation-based {{methodology}} to support secure embedded design. The methodology is explained through a case study, the Thumbpod- 2 portable embedded fingerprint authenticator. By using multi-level validation, we can observe {{the flow of}} sensitive information through the system as it takes on multiple forms, from software variables to hardware bus-signals. This allows shielding off of <b>unwanted</b> sidechannel <b>information</b> leaks at the protocol, software, or hardware level. We discuss how the ThumbPod- 2 design is partitioned into a side-channel-free implementation, and how a codesign environment called GEZEL is used to validate this partitioning process at each abstraction level.

Our work confirms the influence of language mismatch between average voice distributions for synthesis and for transform estimation and the necessity of eliminating this mismatch in order to effectively utilize multiple transforms for cross-lingual speaker adaptation. Specifically, we show that language mismatch introduces <b>unwanted</b> language-specific <b>information</b> when estimating multiple transforms, thus making these transforms detrimental to adaptation performance. Our analysis demonstrates speaker characteristics should be separated from language characteristics in order to improve cross-lingual adaptation performance.

50|$|An {{information}} {{filtering system}} {{is a system that}} removes redundant or <b>unwanted</b> <b>information</b> from an information stream using (semi)automated or computerized methods prior to presentation to a human user. Its main goal is the management of the information overload and increment of the semantic signal-to-noise ratio. To do this the user's profile is compared to some reference characteristics. These characteristics may originate from the information item (the content-based approach) or the user's social environment (the collaborative filtering approach).|$|E

However, the value of electronic mail is being impaired by spam mails including <b>unwanted</b> commercial <b>information,</b> virus mails including malignant codes and many different forms of unnecessary information.

The present study proposes a method in which an electronic mail sender receives confidential information through SMS (Short Message Service) and creates a private key/public key pair used in the DomainKey method and, {{in connection with the}} existing PGP method, the email sender is authenticated and the message is encrypted/decrypted. Because the proposed method authenticates the sender in the process of mail transmission, it can prevent spam mails. Key words: E-mail Authentication, PGP, DomainKey, Anti-SPAM, SM...|$|R

As the Internet started to gain popularity in the early 1990s, it was quickly recognized as an excellent advertising tool. At practically no cost, a person can use the Internet to send an email message to thousands of people. These unsolicited junk electronic mails came to be called 'Spam'. The history of spam is intertwined with the history of electronic mail.|$|E
5000|$|Selective {{hearing is}} not {{known to be a}} {{disorder}} of the physiological or psychological aspect. Under the World Health Organization (WHO), a hearing disorder happens when there is a complete loss of hearing in the ears. It means the loss of the ability to hear. Technically speaking, selective hearing is not [...] "deafness" [...] to a certain sound message. Rather, it is the selectivity of an individual to attend audibly to a sound message. The whole sound message is physically heard by the ear but the idea is the capacity of the mind to systematically filter out <b>unwanted</b> <b>information.</b> Therefore, selective hearing should not be confused as a physiological hearing disorder.|$|E

40|$|To {{minimize}} <b>unwanted</b> interruption and <b>information</b> overload during surveillance, {{mobile police}} officers {{need to be}} supported by a mobile, contextaware notification system.

Subjective judgments showed a positive user experience with the adaptive notification system. These empirical findings are used to improve the design of mobile notification support systems for police officers.

50|$|One {{method of}} taking {{advantage}} of information goods is bundling. That is the strategy of grouping multiple items together and selling them as a group. Bundling allows sellers to better predict the demand for the bundle. While {{it is difficult to}} know which items in the group an individual person wants, they are likely to value some of the items enough to purchase the bundle, even if they don't value any of the items enough to buy it separately. However, this only works when it doesn't cost much to sell extra items in a bundle that are <b>unwanted.</b> <b>Information</b> goods fit this profile since it doesn't cost anything to make extra copies.|$|E

50|$|Since NASA {{scientists}} {{wanted only}} {{certain types of}} gamma rays to be processed and recorded, they set up EGRET with many systems of checks to filter out any <b>unwanted</b> <b>information.</b> The most basic type of filter EGRET had was only allowing gamma rays entering the telescope from certain angles to be let into the spark chamber. As the gamma ray travelled through the spark chamber, it struck one of the metal plates within the spark chamber. Once the gamma ray {{came in contact with}} a plate of metal, it initiated the process of electron-positron pair production and created an electron and positron. Once both the electron and positron were created, if one of these particles was still moving down throughout the telescope and a signal from the anticoincidence scintillator wasn’t fired, the particle was imaged and its energy level recorded. With each gamma ray having to pass all of these systems of checks, the results of EGRET were supported to be the most valuable out of the other CGRO instruments.|$|E

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of formal methods for the description and verification of complex systems is nowadays widely accepted. While some system properties {{can be studied}} in a non-timed and nonprobabilistic setting, others, such as quantitative security properties, system performance and reliability properties, require a timed and probabilistic description of the system.
