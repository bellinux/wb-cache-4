Later Mrs Mac {{decided it was time to}} <b>use</b> <b>our</b> skills in industry, so she persuaded Airzone Ltd to take one of us (me) on trial in their radio section. Soon the others followed from the school, and we started the component parts section, and we were absorbed into many other sections.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should <b>use</b> <b>our</b> critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, the Centre {{was closed}} to regular guests, but the staff became {{involved}} in reuniting refugees, {{many of whom had}} Guiding and Scouting connections. The Centre was also used for training military skiers and interning foreigners. The Swiss Guides were the only Guides who were able to <b>use</b> <b>Our</b> Chalet during the war, except for some French Guiding Commissioners who showed up in 1942. Many refugees came to Switzerland during the war and the staff tried to accommodate them in Our Chalet, but this was not allowed in most cases due to wartime regulations. However, the staff did help them with relief funds from the Guides and Scouts of Switzerland, Great Britain, and the United States. The Our Chalet staff found great joy in helping reunite families who had been divided by war. American Girl Scouts also donated substantial funds to Our Chalet in 1944, through the U.S.A. Friendly Fund, to help with postwar recovery efforts.|$|E
25|$|James Mensch {{provided}} {{an understanding of}} imagining the experiences of others (what can also be called empathic envisioning) and what that might look like {{when he talked about}} literary imagination humans: the capacity of humans to imagine the experiences of characters in novels. Mensch explained that human beings' embodiment provides them with the capacity to imagine these experiences and then relate to them through empathy. For Mensch, people are only capable of having experiences because of and through their body. Humans (Dasein) experience life, others, the world, etc. via their bodies which can taste, smell, hear, feel, and see. More to the point, their bodies encapsulate our various mental faculties required for processing and retaining those experiences. This means human experiences are experiences of the body. Relating to others then is when two bodies experience one another: they inter-relate. Because humans (Dasein) hold their bodily experiences in their memory, they are able to <b>use</b> <b>our</b> literary imagination to envision the experiences of characters in novels.|$|E

He said that the rats in his experiments suffered stunted growth and had suppressed immune systems and that more safety research was required. He also said, [...] "If you gave me the choice now, I wouldn't eat it" [...] and it was [...] "very, very unfair to <b>use</b> <b>our</b> fellow citizens as guinea pigs".|$|E

500|$|Speaking at an April 2008 {{event in}} New York, Byrne {{confirmed}} {{the release of}} a new album, calling it a [...] "record of sung songs" [...] in contrast to the experimental music from MyLifeintheBushofGhosts and later told the NewYorkDailyNews that [...] "Brian had written a lot of music, but needed some words, which I know how to do. What's it sound like? Electronicgospel. That's all I'm saying." [...] Eno also explained the differences between this album and their previous one saying, [...] "his is quite different from MyLife in that the intention of that album was to not <b>use</b> <b>our</b> voices at all, but instead to find voices and stick them on to the music. This new one is different—these are songs written and sung by David... They go from electronic folkgospel to quite indefinable areas of music." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1972, Deep Purple had {{achieved}} considerable commercial success in Japan, including several hit singles, so {{it made sense}} to tour there. Three dates were booked; the Festival Hall, Osaka on 11 and 12 May, and the Budokan, Tokyo on 16 August, though these were later changed to the 15 and 16 August, and 17 August respectively due to an earlier US tour being rescheduled. The dates sold out almost immediately, and consequently the Japanese arm of the band's label, Warner Bros. Records, wanted to record the tour for a live album to be released in the country. The band eventually agreed to the idea, but insisted {{if it was going to}} be released, they wanted it to be done properly. Gillan recalled, [...] "we said we would have to OK the equipment, we wanted to <b>use</b> <b>our</b> own engineer and we would have the last say on whether the tapes were released". The band enlisted producer Martin Birch, who had worked on previous studio albums, to record the shows onto an 8-track recorder so they could subsequently be mixed.|$|E

In {{the book}} Clark alleged that {{during a visit}} to the Pentagon in the autumn of 2001 after 9/11, a [...] "senior general" [...] told him that the Office of the Secretary of Defense had {{produced}} a confidential paper proposing a series of regime change operations in seven countries over a period of five years. He had made the allegation a number of times in public and media appearances in 2006 and 2007. The book also described a conversation Clark had with Paul Wolfowitz in May 1991 after the Gulf War, quoting Wolfowitz as lamenting the non-removal of Saddam Hussein, but also telling him that [...] "...we did learn one thing that’s very important. With the end of the Cold War, we can now <b>use</b> <b>our</b> military with impunity. The Soviets won’t come in to block us.

500|$|During the trial, {{several of}} the 60 'co-claimants' gave evidence. Eva Mozes Kor who was 10 {{years old when she}} arrived at Auschwitz, testified that she and her twin sister were used for the cruel medical {{experiments}} conducted by Josef Mengele and that she had lost her parents and older sisters in Auschwitz. Kor conversed with and embraced the defendant after giving evidence, while other Holocaust survivors in the courtroom protested against this gesture. Another witness, Max Eisen who was 15 {{years old at the time}} of entry into Auschwitz, described the brutality of the extermination part of the camp, including extracting gold teeth from dead victims. On 12 May 2015, Susan Pollack, an 84-year-old Briton, gave evidence how she was taken from Hungary to Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen; describing the living conditions encountered at Auschwitz, she said: [...] "I was in a barrack with about 800 other girls ... we were losing weight, we weren’t able to <b>use</b> <b>our</b> minds anymore". On the same day, Ivor Perl, an 83-year-old Briton who was born in Hungary into a religious Jewish family, also gave evidence; Perl testified that he was 12 years old when he arrived at Auschwitz and that he and his brother lost their parents and seven siblings in the Holocaust." [...] In July, Irene Weiss, an 84-year-old survivor from the United States, testified that her family was torn apart on arrival at Auschwitz in May 1944, during the mass deportation of Hungarian Jews and that she had lost both her parents, four siblings and 13 cousins at Auschwitz.|$|E
