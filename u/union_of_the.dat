5|$|Andronicus' {{rule was}} marked by {{incompetence}} and short-sighted decisions {{that in the long}} run would damage the Byzantine Empire beyond repair.

To popularize his rule he repudiated the <b>union</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orthodox and Catholic Churches decreed by the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, thereby further increasing hostilities between the Latins and the Byzantines.|$|E
