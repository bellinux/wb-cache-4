The transferee of an undertaking under the common law has the right to choose whether he wants to contract with employees or not. By the implementation of section 197 of the Labour Relations Act (1995) and the amended sections 197, 197 A of the Labour Relations Act (2002) the legislator provides for an automatic transfer in cases where the undertaking is transferred as a going concern. The former accordance with the regulations of the insolvency law and the fact that sequestration or the winding-up of an insolvent undertaking had to be to the advantage of the creditors was lost after the legislative steps of 1995. The effects of the above-mentioned sections and especially the problems regarding the transfer of insolvent <b>undertakings</b> <b>shall</b> be analysed in this thesis. It is the aim of this thesis to examine how sections 197, 197 A of the Labour Relations Act and section 38 of the Insolvency Act should be applied and interpreted to achieve social justice. This makes it necessary to examine the history and development of the South African law of transfer of an insolvent undertaking too. Section 197 of the Labour Relations Act is mostly based on European law. Although it is not the intention of this thesis to compare the European law with the South African law, several South African aspects will be examined from a European and especially German perspective...|$|E

Barrister Francis Bennion (formerly Parliamentary Counsel, and author of the authoritative Bennion on Statutory Interpretation) {{wrote in a letter to}} The Times on 20 February 2006 that [...] "The Bill opens the door to much-needed reforms in what is called lawyer's law".|$|R

Concentrations can be differentiated according to whether the concentration affects legal position of the merging <b>undertakings.</b> A concentration <b>shall</b> be deemed to arise where a change of control on a lasting basis results from the merger {{of two or more}} previously independent undertakings or parts of undertakings. Second type of concentrations occurs {{in the case of an}} acquisition of control. Finally, the concentration shall be deemed to arise in the case of creation of a joint venture performing on a lasting basis all the functions of an autonomous economic entity. This paper analyses mergers and concentrations occurring on the basis of acquiring of control in Serbian and EU competition law...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyze the status of {{non-financial}} information disclosure in the European Union in order to evaluate the level of acceptance of social responsibility practices. The research {{is divided into two}} sections and the approach used is mainly theoretical and qualitative. In the first part the UE financial and non-financial information regulations are analyzed; the European Union launched a process of harmonization then subsequently it moved to the standardization process: the Regulation (EC) No. 1606 / 2002 is part of the standardization process (It must be applied in its entirety across the EU) while the Directive 2014 / 95 /EU is part of the harmonization process (it sets out a goal that all EU countries must achieve). The Directive 2014 / 95 /EU states that “large <b>undertakings</b> […] <b>shall</b> include in the management report a non-financial statement […]” thus making mandatory the preparation of non-financial statements. In {{the second part of the}} research, not considering the firm only as a system for the production of financial/economic value but also as an economic social actor which operates in a social environment to which it belongs and with which it interacts, the concept of social entrepreneurship is explained. Social entrepreneurship belongs to the entrepreneurs who draw up the social balance, required or permitted by the UE legislation. For this reason, the introduction of obligations in disclosing non-financial information could lead to the increase of entrepreneurship, with positive consequences in the creation of tangible benefits to both the business community and the global community...|$|R

But these developments were not final, and one sees no hint as yet of any coming finality. Invention runs free and our state is under its dominion. The novel is continually struggling to establish itself at the relative or absolute expense of the old. The statesman's conception of social organization is no longer stability but growth. And so long as material progress continues, this tribute must continue to be paid; so long as the stream of development flows, this necessary back eddy will endure. Even if we [...] "municipalize" [...] all sorts of <b>undertakings</b> we <b>shall</b> not alter the essential facts, we shall only substitute for the shareholder the corporation stockholder. The figure of an eddy is particularly appropriate. Enterprises will come and go, the relative values of kinds of wealth will alter, old appliances, old companies, will serve their time and fall in value, individuals will waste their substance, individual families and groups will die out, certain portions of the share property of the world may be gathered, by elaborate manipulation, into a more or less limited number of hands, conceivably even families and groups will be taxed out by graduated legacy duties and specially apportioned income taxes, but, for all such possible changes and modifications, the shareholding element will still endure, so long as our present progressive and experimental state of society obtains. And the very diversity, laxity, and weakness of the general shareholding element, which will work to prevent its organizing itself in the interests of its property, or of evolving any distinctive traditions or positive characters, will obviously prevent its obstructing the continual appearance of new enterprises, of new shareholders to replace the loss of its older constituents....|$|R

These waters with balanced mineral distribution, {{which do not}} contain organic substances, whose physical and chemical caharacteristics comply with certain quality parameters and which do not negatively affect human health are identified as healthy water. Kuvars water is a spring water which is pumped out from the draw well at the Camurluk stream basin of Maltepe province of Istanbul and filled into bottles. The Camurluk stream basin is approximately 4. 5 km 2 . The Camurluk stream basin is sedimentary rocks and talus deposit outcrops. Reaching of trace elements, which is found more in the talus deposit samples than outcropping quartzarenite at the basin, to underground aquifer as ions under effect of rains, water rock interaction, leakage and filtration, is prevented by illite type clay levels existing within the talus deposit stack, which have upto 20 cm thickness. However, negative effects of the excavation that were made at the talus deposit reflect on the hydrologic cycle and chemical compositions of well waters. This effect was at first negatively affected the physical characteristics of the well waters. During the rainy periods, {{the water in the}} excavated area which was enriched with respect to the suspended sediments was percolated into the groundwaters from the joints and cracks of the quartzarenite. The turbidity value measured in the well waters of K 2 and K 3 were determined as 40. 3 NTU and 34. 2 NTU respectively. Although at the basin, the aquifer of underground water and the well waters being managed are quartzarenite, the fact that water types belonging to well waters differ (they are not same) according to the Piper diagram and when the heavy metal content of the water of well numbered KS 1 is taken as basis, that some heavy metals such as Al 3 +, Fe 2 +, Ni 2 +, Mn 2 + and Cu 2 + be enriched 3 to 40 times in KS 2 and KS 3 well waters, are caused by talus deposit—water interaction at the excavation area. After a rainfall, in the water that became turbid with the water-talus deposit interaction at the excavation area, the water-mineral interaction has caused the limit value for drinking water suggested by World Health Organization (WHO) to be exceeded with the Al 3 + concentration of 189 ppb detected in KS 2 well water and Fe 2 + concentration of 185 ppb has caused to approach the drinking water limit value of 200 ppb permitted by World Health Organization (WHO), United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), European Union (EU) and Turkish Standards (TS). Therefore, at the water basins where bottled spring waters consumed for drinking purposes are produced, technical <b>undertakings</b> that <b>shall</b> disturb the stability of geological units should not be permitted...|$|R
