25|$|Water use {{is about}} 83.5 km3, or 20% of water {{availability}} {{in an average}} year. However, there are large variations in the <b>utilization</b> <b>rate</b> between years and regions. For example, in the coastal part of the Kantō region that includes Tokyo the <b>utilization</b> <b>rate</b> is over 90% in a dry year. In the relatively dry north of Kyushu {{it is more than}} 50%. Of the total use 55.2 km3 was for agriculture, 16.2 km3 for domestic use and 12.1 km3 for industrial use. Despite the introduction of water-saving devices domestic per capita use declined only slightly from 322 liter per capita per day in 2000 to 314 in 2004. Per capita water use thus is slightly lower than in the United States (371 liter in 2005) and more than twice as high as in Germany (122 liter in 2007) or in England (145 liter in 2009).|$|E

40|$|Hospital {{emergency}} services located {{in urban areas}} have been severely congested for several years {{in the province of}} Quebec. This problem is not caused by ambulatory patients who are using {{emergency services}} as a regular source of care, but by patients in need of emergency services. To study the factors affecting the <b>utilization</b> <b>rates</b> of emergency services in two urban areas, the city of Laval and the Quebec metropolitan area, two samples of more than 30, 000 patients each were drawn from the 1981 file of the Régie de l'assurance-maladie du Quebec. The <b>utilization</b> <b>rates</b> of emergency services for emergent and urgent causes in these two samples were computed {{on the basis of the}} census tract location of these patients. The soci-economic characteristics of these census tracts were taken from the 1981 Canadian census, the distance travelled from each census tract to the location of hospital emergency services was computed and included as a predicator of the <b>utilization</b> <b>rates.</b> Also, the prevalence of chronic and psychiatric diagnoses were obtained for each census tract. The result of the analysis showed that distance affected the <b>utilization</b> <b>rates</b> only in the Quebec metropolitan area where the hospitals are mostly located in the downtown area near deprived and working class neighbourhoods, while the socio-economic characteristics affected the <b>utilization</b> <b>rates</b> in both Quebec and Laval. hospitals emergency services factor analysis Quebec...|$|R

These planes were the [...] "quick change" [...] (B727-100QC) model, which had a large freight loading door located on one side of the aircraft just aft of the flight deck.

An immigration official in Kunming even said that it could take [...] "a few weeks" [...] before they can see the next passenger to utilize TWOV. Officials in these cities cited the lack of awareness of the policy, the restrictions on movements, the short period of time, a lack of international flights from airports, and the shortage of services offered by travel agencies as the main reasons of the lack of passengers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} variable capital <b>utilization</b> <b>rates</b> in propagating shocks over the business cycle. To this end we formulate and estimate an equilibrium business cycle model in which cyclical capital <b>utilization</b> <b>rates</b> are viewed {{as a form of}} factor hoarding. We find that variable capital <b>utilization</b> <b>rates</b> substantially magnify and propagate the impact of shocks to agents' environments. The strength of these propagation effects is evident in the dynamic response functions of various economy wide aggregates to shocks in agents' environments, in the statistics that we construct to summarize the strength of the propagation mechanisms in the model and in the volatility of exogenous technology shocks needed to explain the observed variability in aggregate U. S. output. Other authors have argued that standard Real Business Cycle (RBC) models fail to account for certain features of the data because they do not embody quantitatively important propagation mechanisms. These features include the observed positive serial correlation in the growth rate of output, the shape of the spectrum of the growth rate of real output and the correlation between the forecastable component of real output and various other economic aggregates. Allowing for variable capital <b>utilization</b> <b>rates</b> substantially improves the ability of the model to account for these features of the data. ...|$|R
