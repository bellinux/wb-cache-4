5|$|In the 1995 {{compilation}} Children and the Politics of Culture, anthropologist Vivienne Wee {{analyzed the}} perception of children by adults and how it supported the concept of children's rights. Wee wrote that in this model (which she called the European pattern), children were seen as defenseless, <b>unadulterated,</b> {{and in need of}} protection by authoritative adults. According to Wee, this European pattern led to the idea that children required the sanctuary of the United Nations Charter and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.|$|E
5|$|Refined cuisine {{could be}} moralized {{as a sign}} of either civilized {{progress}} or decadent decline. The early Imperial historian Tacitus contrasted the indulgent luxuries of the Roman table in his day with the simplicity of the Germanic diet of fresh wild meat, foraged fruit, and cheese, <b>unadulterated</b> by imported seasonings and elaborate sauces. Most often, because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture, produce—cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruit—was considered a more civilized form of food than meat. The Mediterranean staples of bread, wine, and oil were sacralized by Roman Christianity, while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of paganism, as it might be the product of animal sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into an old}} {{political}} family, Playford was {{the fifth}} Thomas Playford and the fourth to have lived in South Australia; his grandfather Thomas Playford II had served as premier in the 19th century. He {{grew up on the}} family farm in Norton Summit before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in World War I, fighting in Gallipoli and Western Europe. After serving, he continued farming until his election as a Liberal and Country League (LCL) representative for Murray at the 1933 state election. In his early years in politics, Playford was an outspoken backbencher who often lambasted LCL colleagues and ministers and their policies, and had a maverick strategy, often defying party norms and advocating <b>unadulterated</b> laissez faire economics and opposing protectionism and government investment, in stark contrast to his later actions as premier. With the resignation of the LCL's leader, Richard Layton Butler, Playford ascended to the premiership in 1938, having been made a minister just months earlier in an attempt to dampen his insubordination. Playford inherited a minority government and many independents to deal with, and instability was expected; Playford was seen as a transitional leader. However, Playford dealt with the independents adroitly and went on to secure a one-seat majority at the next election.|$|E

25|$|Unsweetened {{chocolate}} is pure chocolate liquor, {{also known as}} bitter or baking chocolate. It is <b>unadulterated</b> chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, {{often referred to as}} raw cacao, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cacao.|$|E
25|$|Nambassa was {{a series}} of hippie-conceived festivals held between 1976 and 1981 on large farms around Waihi and Waikino in New Zealand. They were music, arts and {{alternatives}} festivals that focused on peace, love, and an environmentally friendly lifestyle. In addition to popular entertainment, they featured workshops and displays advocating holistic health issues, alternative medicine, clean and sustainable energy, and <b>unadulterated</b> foods.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Muller— {{the film}} editor for The Trial, Chimes at Midnight and the CBS Special Orson Bag was {{fortunate}} to work on editing three reels of the original, <b>unadulterated</b> version— was asked for his opinion in 2013 from a journalist of Time Out, his reply was he felt that if released without image re-editing, but {{with the addition of}} ad hoc sound and music, it probably would have been rather successful.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Newton placed great {{faith in}} the concept of an <b>unadulterated,</b> pure, ancient doctrine, which he studied vigorously to aid his {{understanding}} of the physical world. Many of Newton's manuscripts—most of which are still unpublished—detail his thorough study of the Corpus Hermeticum, writings said to have been transmitted from ancient times, in which the secrets and techniques of influencing the stars and the forces of nature were revealed, i.e. As Above, So Below.|$|E
25|$|During {{this early}} period of growth, Dome {{proposed}} {{to build a}} liquids recovery plant — in effect, a very large straddle plant — at the Empress, Alberta, delivery point to the TransCanada transmission line. The Empress plant sits just inside the Alberta/Saskatchewan border. This is for reasons related to both politics and infrastructure. Politically, Alberta wanted value to be added inside provincial borders. As importantly, {{it made sense to}} extract liquids before sending the dry gas that remained - <b>unadulterated</b> methane - into the export market.|$|E
25|$|The Memorial, held after sunset, {{includes}} a {{talk on the}} meaning of the celebration and the circulation among the audience of <b>unadulterated</b> red wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe the bread symbolizes Jesus Christ's body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine symbolizes his blood which redeems from sin. They do not believe in transubstantiation or consubstantiation. Because many congregations have no members who claim to be anointed, it is common for no one to partake of the bread and wine.|$|E
25|$|Isotope ratio mass {{spectrometry}} {{can be used}} to detect addition of corn syrup and cane sugar by the carbon isotopic signature. Addition of sugars originating from corn or sugar cane (C4 plants, unlike the plants used by bees, and also sugar beet, which are predominantly C3 plants) skews the isotopic ratio of sugars present in honey, but does not influence the isotopic ratio of proteins. In an <b>unadulterated</b> honey, the carbon isotopic ratios of sugars and proteins should match. Levels as low as 7% of addition can be detected.|$|E
25|$|After the {{premature}} re-election of presbyters and synodals on 23 July 1933, which Adolf Hitler had discretionarily imposed onto all Protestant church {{bodies in}} Germany (see Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union), the Nazi partisan Protestant so-called Faith Movement of German Christians, founded among others by Kube, gained {{a majority in}} the presbytery of the Kaulsdorf Congregation, like in most congregations within the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union. With the new majorities on all levels of church organisation the German Christians systematically tried to subject any <b>unadulterated</b> form of Protestantism by way of firing church employees of other opinion, blocking church property for non-Nazi Protestant groups, prohibiting collections for other purposes than the officially approved ones.|$|E

25|$|After fermentation, {{the beans}} are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, {{which are then}} ground to cocoa mass, <b>unadulterated</b> {{chocolate}} in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor also may be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugars. Much of the chocolate consumed today {{is in the form}} of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.|$|E
25|$|Adulteration {{of honey}} is the {{addition}} of other sugars, syrups, or compounds into honey to change its flavor or viscosity, make it cheaper to produce, or increase the fructose content to stave off crystallization. According to the Codex Alimentarius of the United Nations, any product labeled as honey or pure honey must be a wholly natural product, although different nations have their own laws concerning labeling. Adulteration of honey is sometimes used {{as a method of}} deception when buyers are led to believe that the honey is pure. The practice was common dating back to ancient times, when crystallized honey was often mixed with flour or other fillers, hiding the adulteration from buyers until the honey was liquefied. In modern times, the most common adulteration-ingredient became clear, almost-flavorless corn syrup, which, when mixed with honey, is often very difficult to distinguish from <b>unadulterated</b> honey.|$|E
25|$|Already in the 19th century Catholic Germans of Polish {{ethnicity}} and the German state clashed {{in a struggle}} for the <b>unadulterated</b> Roman Catholic faith in events like the Kulturkampf of the 19th century. In those regions of Germany with a considerable population of Polish ethnicity Catholic Church mobilised Polish resistance during the Prussian partitions of Poland {{and served as a}} stronghold of Polish identity. Due to this Nazis targeted it in the newlly annexed territories. In the General Government the attitude of Nazis was different as it was to serve as temporary work camp and reservation for Poles and they wanted Church's religion to serve as tool to control Poles (this also meant extermination and terror against priests as well opposing Nazi plans) existence. The Nazi fight against Polish parts of Catholic Church was also a problem for the Catholic Church in Germany, where many priests supported nationalist claims during the war and were faced with a split of the Church itself as Polish Catholics were persecuted. Overall the German hierarchy silently accepted (and in some cases supported or encouraged) the discrimination and treatment of Poles as Untermenschen, with notable individual exceptions who either protested or tried to help their fellow church members of non-German ethnicity.|$|E
25|$|Antiochus's actions {{provoked}} a large-scale revolt. Mattathias (Mattityahu), a Jewish priest, and his five sons Jochanan, Simeon, Eleazar, Jonathan, and Judah led a rebellion against Antiochus. It started with Mattathias killing first, a Jew {{who wanted to}} comply with Antiochus's order to sacrifice to Zeus, and then a Greek official who was to enforce the government's behest (1 Mac. 2, 24-25). Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi ("Judah the Hammer"). By 166 BC Mattathias had died, and Judah took his place as leader. By 165 BC the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Temple was liberated and rededicated. The festival of Hanukkah was instituted to celebrate this event. Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar {{to be built in}} place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made. According to the Talmud, <b>unadulterated</b> and undefiled pure olive oil with the seal of the kohen gadol (high priest) was needed for the menorah in the Temple, which was required to burn throughout the night every night. The story goes that one flask was found with only enough oil to burn for one day, yet it burned for eight days, the time needed to prepare a fresh supply of kosher oil for the menorah. An eight-day festival was declared by the Jewish sages to commemorate this miracle.|$|E
25|$|The {{order of}} steps in {{preparing}} {{a cup of}} tea is a much-debated topic, and can vary widely between cultures or even individuals. Some say it is preferable to add the milk before the tea, as the high temperature of freshly brewed tea can denature the proteins found in fresh milk, similar to the change in taste of UHT milk, resulting in an inferior-tasting beverage. Others insist it is better to add the milk after brewing the tea, as black tea is often brewed as close to boiling as possible. The addition of milk chills the beverage during the crucial brewing phase, if brewing in a cup rather than using a pot, meaning the delicate flavour of a good tea cannot be fully appreciated. By adding the milk afterwards, it is easier to dissolve sugar in the tea and also to ensure the desired amount of milk is added, as the colour of the tea can be observed. Historically, the order of steps was taken as an indication of class: only those wealthy enough to afford good-quality porcelain would be confident of its being able to cope with being exposed to boiling water <b>unadulterated</b> with milk. Higher temperature difference means faster heat transfer so the earlier you add milk the slower the drink cools. A 2007 study published in the European Heart Journal found certain beneficial effects of tea may be lost through the addition of milk.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{the run of}} SpongeBob SquarePants, the SpongeBob {{character}} has become very popular with children, teens, and adults. The character's popularity has spread from Nickelodeon's original demographic of two- to eleven-year-olds, to teenagers and adults, including college campuses and celebrities such as Sigourney Weaver and Bruce Willis. [...] Salon.com indicates that the <b>unadulterated</b> innocence of SpongeBob {{is what makes the}} character so appealing. SpongeBob has also become popular with gay men, despite Stephen Hillenburg saying that none of the characters are homosexual. The character draws fans due to his flamboyant lifestyle and tolerant attitude.|$|E
500|$|Scottish {{mezzo-soprano}} Karen Cargill summarized [...] "Maria Radner, {{my beloved}} friend" [...] in The Guardian: [...] "She {{was the most}} generous-spirited person I have ever met.

Dennis Schwartz gave the film a negative review with a grade of [...] "C-" [...] citing [...] "this film was pure and <b>unadulterated</b> balderdash". Some criticised the film for giving a [...] "sweetened unrealistic view of London life and British eccentricity." [...] The Independent derided the film for being unrealistic.|$|E

500|$|The 19th century saw a major {{expansion}} of soap manufacturing in Nablus, {{which became the}} center of soap production throughout the Fertile Crescent. By 1907, the city's 30 factories were producing nearly 5,000 tons of Nabulsi soap annually, over half of all soap production in Palestine. John Bowring wrote of Nabulsi soap in the 1830s that it is, [...] "highly esteemed in the Levant," [...] and Muhammad Kurd Ali, a Syrian historian, wrote in the 1930s that [...] "Nablus soap is the best and most famous soap today for it has, it seems, a quality not found in others and the secret is that it is <b>unadulterated</b> and well produced." ...|$|E
500|$|The Göttingen Seven (...) were a {{group of}} seven professors from Göttingen. In 1837, they protested against the {{abolition}} or alteration of {{the constitution of the}} Kingdom of Hanover by Ernest Augustus and refused to swear an oath to the new king of Hanover. The company of seven was led by Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann, who himself was one of the key advocates of the <b>unadulterated</b> constitution. The other six were the Germanist brothers Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm (famed fairy tale and folk tale writers and storytellers, known together as the Brothers Grimm), jurist Wilhelm Eduard Albrecht, historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus, physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber, and theologian and orientalist Heinrich Georg August Ewald.|$|E
500|$|In his book, The Myth of Evil, Phillip A. Cole {{wrote that}} Helen Lovejoy's plea assumed that {{children}} were pure, <b>unadulterated</b> potential casualties who required constant defense from danger. Cole contrasted this notion with character Bart Simpson, who prefers creating disorder to conformity and adherence to regulations. According to Cole, this exemplifies the dual perception of children by society: guileless potential prey and malevolent entities to be distrusted. Cole wrote that throughout history, {{the child has}} represented humanity's savage past and its optimistic future. Jo Johnson contributed a chapter, [...] "Won't Somebody Think of the Children?", to the book Mediating Moms, in which she analyzed the phrase's use in animated media (including The Simpsons). According to Johnson, the phrase was a key example of popular cultural depictions of mothers as neurotic and filled with anxiety about moral values.|$|E
500|$|Others {{were less}} enamored with Ferris, many taking {{issue with the}} film's [...] "rebel without a cause" [...] hedonism. David Denby of New York Magazine, called the film [...] "a nauseating {{distillation}} of the slack, greedy side of Reaganism." [...] Author Christina Lee agreed, adding it was a “splendidly ridiculous exercise in <b>unadulterated</b> indulgence,” and the film “encapsulated the Reagan era's near solipsist worldview and insatiable appetite for immediate gratification—of living in and for the moment....” Gene Siskel panned the film from a Chicago-centric perspective saying “Ferris Bueller doesn't do anything much fun ... hey don't even sit in the bleachers where all the kids like to sit {{when they go to}} Cubs games.” Siskel did enjoy the chemistry between Jennifer Grey and Charlie Sheen. Ebert thought Siskel was too eager to find flaws in the film's view of Chicago.|$|E
500|$|Films {{should be}} realistic, which is {{possible}} only when the filmmakers have lived with the popular masses, much like {{the ideal of the}} revolutionaries of the Korean resistance. However, this [...] "realism" [...] entails <b>unadulterated</b> worship for the leader and Juche, making it incomparable to conventional types of realism in film, like Italian neorealism. Kim builds on the idea that contemporary North Korea has transcended class conflict and no real conflicts exist to be portrayed in cinema, bar historical and external ones. This {{can be seen as a}} reassertion of the Stalinist Zhdanov Doctrine. No [...] "negative people" [...] who would disagree with the party's policies can exist. Depicting conflicts within North Korean society in film could be considered being critical of the regime. When historical themes are depicted, traditions should be portrayed selectively to support present ideological needs, purged of [...] "feudal ideologies" [...] of traditional tales and legends.|$|E
500|$|Drew Stevenson, {{writing for}} School Library Journal, stated that [...] "skillful {{plotting}} builds layers of tension that draws readers into {{the eye of}} the conflict" [...] and that the ending [...] "is nicely handled in a manner which provides relief without removing any of the chilling implications." [...] Zena Sutherland from Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books commented that the [...] "end is logical, the construction of the plot and the relationships among the well-drawn characters is solid, and the story has pace and suspense." [...] The New York Timess Richard Peck felt that the book's value [...] "lies in the twisted logic of the teen‐agers and how easily they can justify anything", but that [...] "the plot descends into <b>unadulterated</b> melo-drama." [...] He stated that Killing Mr. Griffin 'becomes [...] "an easy read" [...] when it shouldn't', although [...] "there's [...] unto the end: the parents are the last to lose their innocence." ...|$|E
500|$|Gioffre wrote a {{positive}} {{review of the}} album and called Cooder and Bhatt [...] "genuine masters" [...] of their respective instruments. He described the musical interplay between the musicians as [...] "nothing short of astounding" [...] and the album as a rare instance in which a combination of genres works. Gioffre also wrote, [...] "this album is masterfully recorded; each instrument is clear, distinct, and three-dimensional sounding. A Meeting by the River is a must-own, a thing of pure, <b>unadulterated</b> beauty, and the strongest record in Cooder's extensive catalog." [...] Peter Margasak of the Chicago Tribune awarded the album four stars out of four, describing Cooder's performance as [...] "arresting" [...] and Bhatt's as [...] "haunting". Margasak wrote that the fusion revealed a [...] "rare, often transcendental beauty" [...] as the two artists [...] "gently and intuitively" [...] found common ground. Rolling Stone called the album [...] "fruitful" [...] and awarded it three stars out of five.|$|E
500|$|The fight {{scenes were}} heavily choreographed, but the actors were {{required}} to [...] "go full out" [...] to capture realistic effects like having the wind knocked out of them. Makeup artist Julie Pearce, {{who worked for the}} director on the 1997 film The Game, studied mixed martial arts and pay-per-view boxing to portray the fighters accurately. She designed an extra's ear to have cartilage missing, citing as inspiration the boxing match in which Mike Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield's ear. Makeup artists devised two methods to create sweat on cue: spraying mineral water over a coat of Vaseline, and using the <b>unadulterated</b> water for [...] "wet sweat". Meat Loaf, who plays a member of the fight club who has [...] "bitch tits", wore a 90-pound (40kg) fat harness that gave him large breasts for the role. He also wore eight-inch (20cm) lifts in his scenes with Norton to be taller than him.|$|E
500|$|In January 1864 they sailed for the Isthmus of Panama {{on board}} the Orizaba, then {{traveled}} onwards to New York City. Upon Irataba's arrival in New York, Harper's Weekly described him as [...] "the finest specimen of <b>unadulterated</b> aboriginal on this continent". Here Irataba exchanged his suit and sombrero for the uniform and regalia of a major general, including a bright yellow sash, a gold badge encrusted with precious stones, and a medal with the inscription, [...] "Irataba, Chief of the Mohaves, Arizona Territory". In February, when The New York Times asked him to explain {{the nature of his}} visit, he replied: [...] "to see where so many pale faces come from". In New York he met with the former Mohave captive Olive Oatman, and the two conversed in Mohave. Irataba told Oatman that her Mohave adoptive sister Topeka, to whom she had grown very close, still missed her and hoped she would return. Oatman described the encounter as a meeting between friends.|$|E
