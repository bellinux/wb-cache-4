25|$|In the mid-14thcentury, {{upon the}} death of Bolesław Jerzy II of Mazovia, king Casimir III of Poland {{initiated}} campaigns (1340–1366) to take Galicia-Volhynia.

Following the 1386 Union of Krewo, a dynastic union between Poland and Lithuania, much of what became northern Ukraine was ruled by the increasingly Slavicised local Lithuanian nobles as part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. By 1392 the so-called Galicia–Volhynia Wars ended. Polish colonisers of depopulated lands in northern and central Ukraine founded or re-founded many towns.

25|$|According to its Statute of Autonomy, the Valencian {{people are}} a nationality. Their origins {{date back to the}} Catalan-Aragonese {{colonization}} of the Moorish Taifa of Valencia, which was taken by James I of Aragon in 1238 during the Reconquista. The newly founded Kingdom of Valencia was granted wide self-government <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Aragon. Valencia experienced its golden age in the 15th century, as it became the Crown's economic capital and contributed with the most important works of Catalan medieval literature. Self-government continued after the unification of the Spanish Kingdom, but was eventually suspended in 1707 by Phillip V of Spain {{as a result of the}} Spanish War of Succession. Valencian nationalism resurged towards the end of the 19th century, which led to the modern conception of the Valencian Country. Self-government under the Generalitat Valenciana was finally reestablished in 1982 after Spanish transition to democracy.|$|E
25|$|Grenache or Garnacha (as it {{is known}} in Spain) most likely {{originated}} {{in the region of}} Aragon in northern Spain, according to ampelographical evidence. Plantings probably spread from the original birthplace to Catalonia and other lands <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Aragon such as Sardinia and Roussillon in southern France. An early synonym for the vine was Tinto Aragonés (red of Aragon). The grape is known as Cannonau in Sardinia, where it is claimed that it originated there and spread to other Mediterranean lands under Aragon rule. Grenache, under its Spanish synonym Garnacha, was already well established {{on both sides of the}} Pyrenees when the Roussillon region was annexed by France. From there the vine made its way through the Languedoc and to the Southern Rhone region where it was well established by the 19th century. Despite its prevalence in nearby Navarra and Catalonia, Garnacha was not widely planted in the Rioja till the early 20th century as vineyards were replanted following the phylloxera epidemic.|$|E

60|$|There was {{not only}} great wealth but high court {{interest}} among the connections of Edward Effingham. They {{were one of the}} few families then resident in the colonies who thought it a degradation to its members to descend to the pursuits of commerce; and who never emerged from the privacy of domestic life unless to preside in the councils of the colony or to bear arms in her defense. The latter had from youth been the only employment of Edward’s father. Military rank <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain was attained with much longer probation, and by much more toilsome services, sixty years ago than at the present time. Years were passed without murmuring, in the sub ordinate grades of the service; and those soldiers who were stationed in the colonies felt, when they obtained the command of a company, that they were entitled to receive the greatest deference from the peaceful occupants of the soil. Any one of our readers who has occasion to cross the Niagara may easily observe not only the self importance, but the real estimation enjoyed by the hum blest representative of the crown, even in that polar region of royal sunshine. Such, and at no very distant period, was the respect paid to the military in these States, where now, happily, no symbol of war is ever seen, unless at the free and tearless voice of their people. When, therefore, the father of Marmaduke’s friend, after forty years’ service, retired with the rank of major, maintaining in his domestic establishment a comparative splendor, he be came a man of the first consideration in his native colony which was that of New York. He had served with fidelity and courage, and having been, according to the custom of the provinces, intrusted with commands much superior to those to which he was entitled by rank, with reputation also. When Major Effingham yielded to the claims of age, he retired with dignity, refusing his half-pay or any other compensation for services that he felt he could no longer perform.|$|E
60|$|There {{are several}} who are persuaded {{that the same}} thing cannot happen in England, because here (they say) the occupations of merchants, tradesmen, and {{manufacturers}} are not held as degrading situations. I once thought that the low estimation in which commerce was held in France might be reckoned among {{the causes of the}} late Revolution; and I am still of opinion that the exclusive spirit of the French nobility did irritate the wealthy of other classes. But I found long since, that persons in trade and business were by no means despised in France in the manner I had been taught to believe. As to men of letters, they were so far from being despised or neglected, that there was no country, perhaps, in the universe, in which they were so highly esteemed, courted, caressed, and even feared: tradesmen naturally were not so much sought in society, (as not furnishing so largely to the fund of conversation as they do to the revenues of the state,) but the latter description got forward every day. M. Bailly, who made himself the popular mayor on the rebellion of the Bastile, and is a principal actor in the revolt, before the change possessed a pension or office <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> six hundred pound English a year,--for that country, no contemptible provision; and this he obtained solely as a man of letters, and on no other title. As to the moneyed men, whilst the monarchy continued, there is no doubt, that, merely as such, they did not enjoy the privileges of nobility; but nobility was of so easy an acquisition, that it was the fault or neglect of all of that description who did not obtain its privileges, for their lives at least, in virtue of office. It attached under the royal government to an innumerable multitude of places, real and nominal, that were vendible; and such nobility were as capable of everything as their degree of influence or interest could make them,--that is, as nobility of no considerable rank or consequence. M. Necker, so far from being a French gentleman, was {{not so much as a}} Frenchman born, and yet we all know the rank in which he stood on the day of the meeting of the States.|$|E
60|$|They were proved wrong, {{and they}} were right. They were judged finally and forgotten, {{and they were}} right. Centuries after their fall the full {{experience}} and development of political discovery has shown beyond question that they were right. For {{there is a very}} simple test of the truth; that the very thing which was dismissed, as a dream of the ages of faith, we have been forced to turn into a fact in the ages of fact. It is now more certain than it ever was before that Europe must rescue some lordship, or overlordship, of these old Roman provinces. Whether it is wise for England alone to claim Palestine, whether {{it would be better if}} the Entente could do so, I think a serious question. But in some form they are reverting for the Roman Empire. Every opportunity has been given for any other empire that could be its equal, and especially for the great dream of a mission for Imperial Islam. If ever a human being had a run for his money, it was the Sultan of the Moslems riding on his Arab steed. His empire expanded over and beyond the great Greek empire of Byzantium; a last charge of the chivalry of Poland barely stopped it at the very gates of Vienna. He was free to unfold everything that was in him, and he unfolded the death that was in him. He reigned and he could not rule; he was successful and he did not succeed. His baffled and retreating enemies left him standing, and he could not stand. He fell finally with that other half-heathen power in the North, with which he had made an alliance against the remains of Roman and Byzantine culture. He fell because barbarism cannot stand; because even when it succeeds it rather falls on its foes and crushes them. And after all these things, after all these ages, with a wearier philosophy, with a heavier heart, we have been forced to do again the very thing that the Crusaders were derided for doing. What Western men failed to do for the faith, other Western men have been forced to do even without the faith. The sons of Tancred are again in Tripoli. The heirs of Raymond are again in Syria. And men from the Midlands or the Northumbrian towns went again through a furnace of thirst and fever and furious fighting, to gain the same water-courses and invest the same cities as of old. They trod the hills of Galilee and the Horns of Hattin threw no shadow on their souls; they crossed dark and disastrous fields whose fame had been hidden from them, and avenged the fathers they had forgotten. And the most cynical of modern diplomatists, making their settlement by the most sceptical of modern philosophies, can find no practical or even temporary solution for this sacred land, except to bring it again <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> Coeur de Lion and the cross of St. George.|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} and {{dynamics of the}} population of Sessile Oak (Quercus petraea) in two conservation areas of the Fontainebleau forest, France, is described. In this Beech forest, oaks are few in number, and mostly very old (an individual lived for more than 470 years). However, pollen analysis shows that the Sessile Oak was dominant in this forest up {{to the end of the}} Middle Ages. The successive stages of the Oak's life-cycle are described : acorn production, acorn consumption by animals, establishment and mortality of the seedlings, survival of young plants, annual growth, and mortality rate. Mortality rates of seedlings and saplings are very high, and much higher than those of sympatric beeches, which can grow successfully even <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> old oak trees. Although the greater life-span of the oaks ensures them a better chance of regeneration than Beech, the forest clearings were filled by Oak recruits only once during the last 150 years.
