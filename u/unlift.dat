Using the results for the corresponding 4 D theories, we find the IR dynamics of the 3 D cases via compactification and a real mass deformation.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we focus on}} the {{dynamics}} of Coulomb branches in 3 dimensional N = 2 SUSY theories. The first part of this thesis is dedicated for the most part to a review of previously known results, providing the necessary background to understand the generalization to more complicated theories. We review in details both the behavior of U(1) theories with generic number of flavors and S U(N) theories with fundamentals. We also provide insights on the mapping of Coulomb branch operators across dualities as vortex/monopole operators. In {{the second part of the}} thesis we investigate the IR dynamics of N = 2 SUSY gauge theories in 3 D with antisymmetric matter.

Boolean connectives, quantifiers and sequents in the HOL logic can all be lifted to operate on predicates. The lifted logical operators and sequents form a Logic of Predicates (LP) whose behavior resembles closely that of the <b>unlifted</b> HOL logic. Of the applications of LP we describe two in some detail: (1) a semantic embedding of Lamport's Temporal Logic of Actions, and (2) an alternative formulation of set theory.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} whether corneal flaps {{can be generated}} by the 80 MHz near-infrared, intense nanojoule femtosecond laser based on multiphoton absorption. METHODS: A solid-state Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser system was integrated in an inverted JenLab Femt-O-Cut laser scanning microscope. A diffraction-limited 40 X objective was used to induce multiphoton ionization and plasma production, New Zealand albino rabbits and porcine eyes were used. Surgical outcomes were determined using frame and line scans with nanojoule pulses at a wavelength of 800 nm. RESULTS: Surgical performance was assessed by optical imaging, histology, and electron microscopy. No significant corneal turbidity was observed. Optical imaging and histological examinations detected virtually no perturbation in the surrounding tissue. Corneal flaps and stromal lenticules were generated. Wound repair of the <b>unlifted</b> flaps was observed up to 90 days postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical results and follow-up studies confirm that this femtosecond laser at nanojoule pulse energy is able to generate corneal flaps precisely, without causing visible collateral damage to the surrounding tissue or overlying epithelium...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} typed {{calculus}} IL (“intermediate language”) which supports the embedding of ML-like (strict, eager) and Haskell-like (non-strict, lazy) languages, without favoring either. IL’s type system includes negation (continuations), but not implication (function arrow). Within IL {{we find that}} lifted sums and products can be represented as the double negation of their <b>unlifted</b> counterparts. We exhibit a compilation function from IL to AM—an abstract von Neumann machine—which maps values of ordinary and doubly negated types to heap structures resembling those found in practical implementations of languages in the ML and Haskell families. Finally, we show that a small variation {{in the design of}} AM allows us to treat any ML value as a Haskell value at runtime without cost, and project a Haskell value onto an ML type with only the cost of a Haskell deepSeq. This suggests that IL and AM may be useful as a compilation and execution model for a new language which combines the best features of strict and non-strict functional programming. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple and {{efficient}} method to compute the weighted mean square error for a biorthogonal M-channel wavelet coder for multidimensional signals. Indeed, biorthogonal filters weight the amount of quantization error which appears on the reconstructed output. We show that the mean square error of a reconstructed signal, resulting from the quantization errors of the M cosets provided by an M-channel wavelet coder, can be expressed as only {{a function of the}} polyphase components of the synthesis filters. Hence, the weights can be computed easily, in any dimension, for any lattice, and any downsampling. As examples, we deal with the computation of the weights for the two-dimensional non separable quincunx filters and for the lifted and <b>unlifted</b> butterfly scheme, showing that the proposed formulation of the weights is particularly useful in case of M-channel lifting schemes. Experimental results demonstrate that the efficiency of a bit allocation process in a geometry coding of triangular meshes is increased thanks {{to the use of the}} weighted mean square error as distortion criterion: the PSNR gain reaches up to more than + 3 dB at some bitrates...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere are {{a finite}} number of inequivalent {{isometric}} frames (equal-norm tight frames) of n vectors for Cd which are generated from a single vector by applying an Abelian group G of symmetries. Each of these so-called harmonic frames can be obtained by taking d rows of the character table of G; often in many different ways, which may even include using different Abelian groups. Using an algorithm implemented in the algebra package Magma, we determine which of these are equivalent. The resulting list of all harmonic frames for various choices of n and d is freely available, and it includes many properties of the frames such as: a simple description, which Abelian groups generate it, identification of the full group of symmetries, the minimum, average and maximum distance between vectors in the frame, and whether it is real or complex, lifted or <b>unlifted.</b> Additional attributes aimed at specific applications include: a measure of the cross correlation (Grassmannian frames), the number of erasures (robustness to erasures), and the diversity product of the full group of its symmetries (multiple-antenna code design).

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{directly}} compositional and type-directed anal-ysis of quantifier ambiguity, scope islands, wide-scope indefinites and inverse linking. It {{is based on}} Danvy and Filinski’s continuation hier-archy, with deterministic semantic composition rules that are uniquely determined by the formation rules of the overt syntax. We thus obtain a compositional, uniform and parsimonious treatment of quantifiers in subject, object, embedded-NP and embedded-clause positions without resorting to Logical Forms, Cooper storage, type-shifting and other ad hoc mechanisms. To safely combine the continuation hierarchy with quantification, we give a precise logical meaning to often used informal devices such as picking a variable and binding it off. Type inference determines variable names, banishing “unbound traces”. Quantifier ambiguity arises in our analysis solely because quantifier words are polysemous, or come in several strengths. The continuation hierarchy lets us assign strengths to quantifiers, which determines their scope. In-definites and universals differ in their scoping behavior because their lex-ical entries are assigned different strengths. PPs and embedded clauses, like the main clause, delimit the scope of embedded quantifiers. Unlike the main clause, their limit extends only {{up to a certain}} hierarchy level, letting higher-level quantifiers escape and take wider scope. This inter-play of strength and islands accounts for the complex quantifier scope phenomena. We present an economical “direct style”, or continuation hierarchy on-demand, in which quantifier-free lexical entries and phrases keep their simple, <b>unlifted</b> types. ...|$|R

60|$|All {{day that}} hill of houses over London had been domed and sealed up with cold cloud. Yet {{three men and}} two girls had at last found even the gray and chilly garden more {{tolerable}} than the black and cheerless interior. When the wind came it split the sky and shouldered the cloudland left and right, unbarring great clear furnaces of evening gold. The burst of light released and the burst of air blowing seemed to come almost simultaneously; and the wind especially caught everything in a throttling violence. The bright short grass lay all one way like brushed hair. Every shrub in the garden tugged at its roots like a dog at the collar, and strained every leaping leaf after the hunting and exterminating element. Now and again a twig would snap and fly like a bolt from an arbalist. The three men stood stiffly and aslant against the wind, as if leaning against a wall. The two ladies disappeared into the house; rather, to speak truly, they were blown into the house.

6000|$|SECTION VI. The average {{rise and}} fall of the tide is about three feet (varying {{considerably}} with the seasons; [Footnote: Appendix III, [...] "Tides of Venice."]) but this fall, on so flat a shore, is enough to cause continual movement in the waters, and in the main canals to produce a reflux which frequently runs like a mill stream. At high water no land is visible for many miles to the north or south of Venice, except in the form of small islands crowned with towers or gleaming with villages: there is a channel, some three miles wide, between the city and the mainland, and some mile and a half wide between it and the sandy breakwater called the Lido, which divides the lagoon from the Adriatic, but which is so low as hardly to disturb the impression of the city's having been built in the midst of the ocean, although the secret of its true position is partly, yet not painfully, betrayed by the clusters of piles set to mark the deep-water channels, which undulate far away in spotty chains like the studded backs of huge sea-snakes, and by the quick glittering of the crisped and crowded waves that flicker and dance before the strong winds upon the <b>unlifted</b> level of the shallow sea. But the scene is widely different at low tide. A fall of eighteen or twenty inches is enough to show ground over the greater part of the lagoon; and at the complete ebb the city is seen standing in the midst of a dark plain of seaweed, of gloomy green, except only where the larger branches of the Brenta and its associated streams converge towards the port of the Lido. Through this salt and sombre plain the gondola and the fishing-boat advance by tortuous channels, seldom more than four or five feet deep, and often so choked with slime that the heavier keels furrow the bottom till their crossing tracks are seen through the clear sea water like the ruts upon a. wintry road, and the oar leaves blue gashes upon the ground at every stroke, or is entangled among the thick weed that fringes the banks with the weight of its sullen waves, leaning to and fro upon the uncertain sway of the exhausted tide. The scene is often profoundly oppressive, even at this day, when every plot of higher ground bears some fragment of fair building: but, in order to know what it was once, let the traveller follow in his boat at evening the windings of some unfrequented channel far into the midst of the melancholy plain; let him remove, in his imagination, the brightness of the great city that still extends itself in the distance, and the walls and towers from the islands that are near; and so wait, until the bright investiture and, sweet warmth of the sunset are withdrawn from the waters, and the black desert of their shore lies in its nakedness beneath the night, pathless, comfortless, infirm, lost in dark languor and fearful silence, except where the salt runlets plash into the tideless pools, or the seabirds flit from their margins with a questioning cry; and he will be enabled to enter in some sort into the horror of heart with which this solitude was anciently chosen by man for his habitation. They little thought, who first drove the stakes into the sand, and strewed the ocean reeds for their rest, that their children were to be the princes of that ocean, and their palaces its pride; and yet, in the great natural laws that rule that sorrowful wilderness, let it be remembered what strange preparation had been made for the things which no human imagination could have foretold, and how the whole existence and fortune of the Venetian nation were anticipated or compelled, by the setting of those bars and doors to the rivers and the sea. Had deeper currents divided their islands, hostile navies would again and again have reduced the rising city into servitude; had stronger surges beaten their shores, all the richness and refinement of the Venetian architecture must have been exchanged for the walls and bulwarks of an ordinary sea-port. Had there been no tide, as in other parts of the Mediterranean, the narrow canals of the city would have become noisome, and the marsh in which it was built pestiferous. Had the tide been only a foot or eighteen inches higher in its rise, the water-access to the doors of the palaces would have been impossible: even as it is, there is sometimes a little difficulty, at the ebb, in landing without setting foot upon the lower and slippery steps: and the highest tides sometimes enter the courtyards, and overflow the entrance halls. Eighteen inches more of difference between the level of the flood and ebb would have rendered the doorsteps of every palace, at low water, a treacherous mass of weeds and limpets, and the entire system of water-carriage for the higher classes, in their easy and daily intercourse, must have been done away with.

The average {{rise and}} fall of the tide is about three feet (varying {{considerably}} with the seasons[3]); but this fall, on so flat a shore, is enough to cause continual movement in the waters, and in the main canals to produce a reflux which frequently runs like a mill stream. At high water no land is visible for many miles to the north or south of Venice, except in the form of small islands crowned with towers or gleaming with villages: there is a channel, some three miles wide, between the city and the mainland, and some mile and a half wide between it and the sandy breakwater called the Lido, which divides the lagoon from the Adriatic, but which is so low as hardly to disturb the impression of the city's having been built in the midst of the ocean, although the secret of its true position is partly, yet not painfully, betrayed by the clusters of piles set to mark the deep-water channels, which undulate far away in spotty chains like the studded backs of huge sea-snakes, and by the quick glittering of the crisped and crowded waves that flicker and dance before the strong winds upon the <b>unlifted</b> level of the shallow sea. But the scene is widely different at low tide. A fall of eighteen or twenty inches is enough to show ground over the greater part of the lagoon; and at the complete ebb the city is seen standing in the midst of a dark plain of seaweed, of gloomy green, except only where the larger branches of the Brenta and its associated streams converge towards the port of the Lido. Through this salt and sombre plain the gondola and the fishing-boat advance by tortuous channels, seldom more than four or five feet deep, and often so choked with slime that the heavier keels furrow the bottom till their crossing tracks are seen through the clear sea water like the ruts upon a wintry road, and the oar leaves blue gashes upon the ground at every stroke, or is entangled among the thick weed that fringes the banks with the weight of its sullen waves, leaning to and fro upon the uncertain sway of the exhausted tide. The scene is often profoundly oppressive, even at this day, when every plot of higher ground bears some fragment of fair building: but, in order to know what it was once, let the traveller follow in his boat at evening the windings of some unfrequented channel far into the midst of the melancholy plain; let him remove, in his imagination, the brightness of the great city that still extends itself in the distance, and the walls and towers from the islands that are near; and so wait, until the bright investiture and sweet warmth of the sunset are withdrawn from the waters, and the black desert of their shore lies in its nakedness beneath the night, pathless, comfortless, infirm, lost in dark languor and fearful silence, except where the salt runlets plash into the tideless pools, or the sea-birds flit from their margins with a questioning cry; and he will be enabled to enter in some sort into the horror of heart with which this solitude was anciently chosen by man for his habitation. They little thought, who first drove the stakes into the sand, and strewed the ocean reeds for their rest, that their children were to be the princes of that ocean, and their palaces its pride; and yet, in the great natural laws that rule that sorrowful wilderness, let it be remembered what strange preparation had been made for the things which no human imagination could have foretold, and how the whole existence and fortune of the Venetian nation were anticipated or compelled, by the setting of those bars and doors to the rivers and the sea. Had deeper currents divided their islands, hostile navies would again and again have reduced the rising city into servitude; had stronger surges beaten their shores, all the richness and refinement of the Venetian architecture must have been exchanged for the walls and bulwarks of an ordinary sea-port. Had there been no tide, as in other parts of the Mediterranean, the narrow canals of the city would have become noisome, and the marsh in which it was built pestiferous. Had the tide been only a foot or eighteen inches higher in its rise, the water-access to the doors of the palaces would have been impossible: even as it is, there is sometimes a little difficulty, at the ebb, in landing without setting foot upon the lower and slippery steps: and the highest tides sometimes enter the courtyards, and overflow the entrance halls. Eighteen inches more of difference between the level of the flood and ebb would have rendered the doorsteps of every palace, at low water, a treacherous mass of weeds and limpets, and the entire system of water-carriage for the higher classes, in their easy and daily intercourse, must have been done away with. The streets of the city would have been widened, its network of canals filled up, and all the peculiar character of the place and the people destroyed.|$|R
